The same year, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman returned the visit to Turkey.\nMr Erdogan returned to Saudi Arabia as part of a three-day tour of the Gulf last year. The trip was aimed at strengthening Turkey's ties with the Gulf countries amid Turkey's economic crisis.\nTurkey is seeking financial support as it struggles with inflation of more than 70 per cent.\nEarlier this year, Turkey's Trade Minister Omer Bolat said bilateral economic relations had made “tremendous” progress.\n“God willing, 2024 will take its place as a golden year in the economic relations between Türkiye and Saudi Arabia,” Mr Bolat was quoted by Turkey's Daily Sabah as saying during his visit in March.\nAnkara also appears to be open to improving relations with Damascus, after Arab countries including Saudi Arabia restored ties. Mr Erdogan recently made overtures to Syria's President amid signs of warming relations.\n“We have now come to such a point that if Bashar Al Assad takes a step towards improving relations with Turkey, we will show that approach towards him,” Mr Erdogan said last week.\nThe potential rapprochement comes after Syria was readmitted to the Arab League, from which it was suspended following the outbreak of the Syrian civil war.\nMr Assad attended the Arab League summit in Saudi Arabia last year, followed by this year's summit in Bahrain.\nAnkara and Riyadh have also called for a ceasefire in the war in Gaza and criticised Israel over its conduct in the war.",
