  "body_text": "Manchester United return to Premier League action on Sunday as they travel to Gtech Community Stadium where they will face Brentford. United are unlikely to better their position in the league this season and will be banking UEFA Champions League football on winning the UEFA Europa League this season.\nUnited beat Athletic Club 3-0 at San Memés on Thursday evening with Casemiro opening the scoring and Bruno Fernandes scoring a brace, one goal from the penalty spot. This United side started badly in Spain but soon found a way to lead the game scoring all three goals in the first half of the match.\nBrentford beat Nottingham Forest 2-0 on Thursday evening, stopping the Midlands side from reaching third place in the Premier League with four matches still to be played. Brentford sit in 11th place the season, ten points better off than United. Ruben Amorim should prioritise the Europa League now, blooding in youth in the league.\nPredicted Manchester United Starting XI – 3-4-2-1\nOnana;\nDe Ligt, Maguire, Yoro;\nMazraoui, Ugarte, Mainoo, Amass;\nFernandes, Garnacho;\nHojlund\nGoalkeeper: Onana\nAndre Onana kape his 11th clean sheet of the season in United’s 3-0 victory over Athletic Club in the UEFA Europa League semi final first leg, which shows how bad United have been in goal this season. It was his second clean sheet in the Europa League with United still undefeated in the competition.\nThe Cameroonian may not be guaranteed to keep him first choice goalkeeper status at United next season with the club looking at a number of different options, which would be good for the club as competition is a good thing and that competition is not really present at the Old Trafford club this season.\nAltay Bayindir is an option but his experience at the club it not as vast as Onana’s, which makes me think that Amorim will continue with the Cameroonian over his Turkish teammate. United will need to be wary of the threat of Brentford, and Onana will know having faced them before. United should seek another victory here.\nDefenders: De Ligt, Maguire, Yoro\nThe United defence has been cut some slack now that Matthijs de Ligt is back in action for the club. A start may be too soon for him after his cameo appearance against Bilbao on Thursday, but I think he will be ready to step back into the fray for United to allow his teammates to get some rest before Thursday’s important match.\nDe Ligt should start on the right side of the back three, which is where he has mostly played this season – with some appearances in the centre of the back three. For this match, Harry Maguire should continue in the centre of the back three, despite the threat he can offer in the attack, which has been second to none recently.\nLeny Yoro should start on the left side of the back three, a position that he has thrived in this season since returning from the injury he sustained during the pre-season tour of the USA. This trio should perform to the best of their abilities in the defence but there will be be many options on the bench, should they be required.\nMidfield: Mazraoui, Ugarte, Mainoo, Amass\nThe midfield can change ahead of the all-important semi final second leg against Bilbao at Old Trafford next Thursday, allowing players to get some rest in, and keep fit at the same time. Noussair Mazraoui should start on the right side of the midfield as his experience there is second to none right now.\nOn the left, Patrick Dorgu might be chosen but Harry Amass should be given more time in the Premier League to show what he can do, especially under pressure as his inclusion could save United money in the summer with a rebuild still on the cards 12 years after the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson.\nIn the centre of the midfield, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo should start together to give United some options ahead of the Europa League semi final second leg, and to the final of the competition with United having one foot in the final. There will be many options on the bench for Amorim to choose from, should the need arise.\nAttack: Fernandes, Hojlund, Garnacho\nUnited’s attacking is still problematic at this stage of the season. Bruno Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho should be starting the match with no other player fit enough to start at this stage of the season. United have Amad back but his fitness may not be at the level for him to be starting this match.\nRasmus Hojlund seems to be in full confidence at this stage of the season, after a very turbulent season for the Danish attacker. His goal against Bournemouth was a boost for him and despite trying, he did not find the back of the net against Bilbao. Sunday could be an important fixture for the striker, who needs to find his scoring boots.\nUnited will have some options on the bench, despite many not be out and out attacking players. Mason Mount could be an option with Chido Obi also another option, despite him being at the start of his career and not really fitting in with the first team environment at this club. He is a raw striker.\nSubstitutes: Bayindir; Lindelof, Shaw, Fredricson; Mount, Eriksen, Casemiro; Amad, Obi\nUnited will be able to name a maximum of nine players on the bench against Brentford in the Premier League. Altay Bayindir will be the goalkeeper on the bench with him seeking chances in goal with Onana not doing that great for United since his arrival in the summer of 2023.\nIn defence, Victor Lindelof, Luke Shaw and Tyler Fredricson should all be available for the Brentford clash with one or more of them likely to get on the pitch at some point with United looking to rotate a number of players with the priority on the UEFA Europa League rather than the Premier League at this stage of the season.\nIn midfield, Mason Mount, Christian Eriksen and Casemiro should also be part of the squad. But Amorim could choose to add more youth to the bench to give them a chance. In attack, Amad and Chido Obi should both be on the bench with United not having many attacking options this season.\nWritten by Paul\nDiscover more from Daily Man Utd News\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.",
