Chukwueze is still young and Villareal can’t set a high price-tag because he can leave for free next year\nHowever, we’ve still got Marquinhos who’s much younger and hasn’t been tested yet in EPL. We’ve got enough wingers, so we’d better focus on the most important part of our spine\nI think we can forget about Caicedo, because Brighton can still force him to stay for three more years. Even the ultra-rich Chelsea seem looking for an alternative, such as Gabri Veiga\n-\nAm very impressed by this Gabri Viega kid, but i had always seen him playing in the final third.\nAs am made to understand he can play as a defensive midfielder, this kid is amazing.But there must be something else about the youngsters as his release clause is pretty low £37 mill.\nCould it be scout’s not sure about his abilities in the premier league why he’s still available?\n-\n-\nHe’s a fantastic player but why would he want to join as a backup for Saka? In the article you say ‘competition’, but would that be fair competition?\nWe already have players who can cover Saka’s role in Nelson and trossard plus ESR is apparently staying and we do still have Vieira – I’m not sure how we could fit in another forward who, as far as I can tell, only really plays right wing. It could only work for Chukwueze if Saka moved to a different position, or something terrible like he picked up an injury or changed clubs.\nImo Chukwueze is too good to bring in under these circumstances – he will believe he’s earned the right to be a starter at his next club, realistically, and that wouldn’t be the case here, so it seems like it would be an expensive signing with a low chance of success.-\nDavi,Chukwueze is a fantastic player and I fully concur with the writer that we should pursue him.Last season we almost ran Saka to the ground,we shouldn’t repeat the same this season orelse we will turn him into a crock the way we did to Wilshere.\nWe therefore need a proper winger to give Saka a good breather between matches.With us trying to do better in Epl&fighting for other trophies, signing a player of Chukwuezas quality will be brilliant.-\nI agree that we should play Saka less for his own good, but Chukwueze is a player who should want to be starting every big game, not covering for Saka in smaller matches – I can’t see him being happy with that role after starring against sides like Madrid and Barcelona. We should be rotating Saka with trossard and Nelson next season – Nelson will be easier to keep happy in that role, and trossard can play/rotate with several positions.\n-\n-\n-\nNeither Chukwueze or Havertz should be a priority signing just now, good players yes.\nArsenal have to get our priorities right, Rice, Lavia/ Caicedo, Osimhen/ Vlohovic got to be our priority now, before we start talking about wingers\n-\nWhat I like abou this well written and obviously well educated writer is how he writes clearly and without waffle. Concise and clear opinions, much of which I find sensible and well argued. An added plus for us signing atop class Niigerian player is that so many Nigerians are Arsenal mad fans and that is all to the good.\nKanu, even though not a player I personally thought as VERY GOOD as so many other Gooners clearly do, was the prime reason we are SO popular in Nigeria and so TOP class Nigerians have a head start in our club even before they play.\nThat is a factor we should ignore,PROVIDED a player is good enough.\nI look forward to more excellent articles from Michael.-\n“should NOT ignore.”\n-\nWe love Kanu a.k.a papilo so much in Nigeria. I did not watch any of his games in an arsenal shirt. But i thought he was very good and an absolute nightmare for defenders and goalkeepers. (Judging by his perfomance for national team and few arsenal clips i watched)\nI started supporting Arsenal in 2006 primarily because of the very attractive style of play, it was like a work of art. I still miss the days of Hleb, Fabregas, Flamini & Rosicky.\nI recently moved to the U.K (Manchester) to further my studies, and most weekends i’m working at JD Wetherspoon. It is common to see drunk fans asking if i support City or United. The few United fans i have met are OK with me being an Arsenal fan, but i would never understand why they hate Liverpool so much.\nI think with the right signings, we can challenge for the title and perhaps win in in 2024/2025 or 2025/2026 season.\nFor 2023/2024, I will be satisfied should we win at least one of the domestic cups and make a good UCL run + a top 2 finish.\n-\n-\nIf Cancelo is a realistic option, then Tomiyaso could fetch a decent fee or throw him into the Declan Rice bid?",
