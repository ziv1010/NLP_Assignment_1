He is the Portuguese manager of a Portuguese team and the expectation of almost everybody in the room was that Portuguese should be the order of the day.\nSo hungry was Cotterill to ask his incisive question about a future United manager possibly beating City that he failed to grasp the press officer’s clear argument – in English – that Amorim’s wonderful English will be back on the menu when he’s in England.\nVIDEO Why Man United HAD To Sack Erik Ten Hag\n“Sorry,” said Amorim. “They will miss me in Portuguese so I have to speak Portuguese.”\n“They’ve had about 25 minutes in Portuguese. We want ten seconds in English,” came the astonishing response, ‘we’ doing some particularly heavy lifting in a room that must have been growing increasingly tired of the interjection.\nThe reaction on social media has been something of a cold shoulder to Cotterill. Football fans can be an unforgiving bunch and have an especially keen radar when it comes to reporters inadvertently making themselves the story.\nSporting CP, not Manchester United, take on Manchester City in Champions League action on Tuesday evening.\nChris is a Warwickshire-based freelance writer, Editor-in-Chief of AVillaFan.com, author of the High Protein Beef Paste football newsletter and owner of Aston Villa Review.
