Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nShould Chelsea fail to agree a fee with Milan, they may well stick with their current crop of keepers which is set to be boosted by the returning Djordje Petrovic and Mike Penders from their respective loans.\nBut former Premier League winger Jermaine Pennant believes Maresca’s side missed a trick by not seeking to sign Caoimhin Kelleher at the start of the window.\nThe Republic of Ireland international left Liverpool to join Brentford for a measly £12.5m fee, having previously attracted interest from Chelsea as well as Tottenham.\nBut Penannt is certain that the Irishman would have represented a major upgrade on the Blues’ current first choice\n‘He’s definitely better than (Robert) Sanchez,’ Pennant told talkSPORT when asked if Chelsea should have considered a move for Kelleher.\n‘He never let Liverpool down, and when Alisson did get injured, at no point did you worry because he was so comfortable as a number two. Probably the best number two out there.\nMore Trending\n‘Every time he was in there, he was solid and made some big saves. He wasn’t as good with his feet and sometimes Liverpool had to change because of that, but apart from that, what a great servant.\n‘He kept Liverpool in so many games and was a huge part of why they won the league – he played a lot of games last season.’\nFormer Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy was equally full of praise for Kelleher’s performances whilst at the Merseyside club.\n‘He’s remarkable. Not only his ability and coming in and doing what he does but he never moaned or sulked when Alisson came back in after injury – he just got on. And what a snip for just 12 mil. For Brentford, it’s a great deal.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Chelsea signing Liam Delap decides between Club World Cup and U21 Euros\nMORE: Al-Hilal make offer for £63m Man Utd target after missing out on Bruno Fernandes\nMORE: Why Arsenal, Liverpool and Man Utd are not playing in the Club World Cup",
