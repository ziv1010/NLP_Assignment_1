And do they have the possibility of winning the trophy?\nChampions League: What record have Russo and Kane both broken?\nRusso's football has come alive under new Arsenal boss Renée Slegers and she has found her scoring boots this season. So much so that she has broken the record for the most goals in a Champions League single season by an Englishwoman.\nRusso's goal in the second leg of Arsenal's semi-final against Lyon - which they won 4-1 and 5-3 on aggregate to claim a spot in the final - brought her to seven goals this season. When including the qualifying rounds she has eight this campaign.\nThat eclipses the six goals scored by Fran Kirby in the 2020/21 season and Danielle Carter in the 2013/14 campaign.\nHer efforts have helped Arsenal to their first Women's Champions League final in 18 years.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nThey are the only English team to win the competition but face Barcelona in the final, the back-to-back defending champions.\nBayern Munich's Harry Kane has also been on fire this campaign and has broken the same record in the men's competition.\nHe became the first Englishman to score 10 goals in the competition and added another to bring his total to 11.\nUnlike Russo's Arsenal though, Bayern Munich have been knocked out of the Champions League.\nThey were defeated 4-3 on aggregate by Inter Milan in the quarter-final.\nAlso in the men's competition, Arsenal could potentially play against the same opponent as the women's team if they make the final.\nArsenal men play Paris Saint-Germain in the semi-final and on the other side of the draw are Barcelona and Inter.\nIf Arsenal and Barcelona win their respective semi-finals it would be the first time ever the men and women's competitions had the same clubs in the final.\nThen if the same club win both the men and women's competitions, it would be the first season where the same club won the trophy in the same campaign.\nSarah joined the FourFourTwo team in September 2024 in a freelance role.
