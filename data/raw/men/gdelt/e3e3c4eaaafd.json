I think he’s charismatic, he needs time, he needs a few transfer windows, he needs backing, but also he needs help on what is a United player and what a United player looks like.”\nOne player Amorim has not had at his disposal for the last three months is Rashford, who joined Aston Villa on loan after a breakdown in relations with the United boss.\nGiggs, who helped bring Rashford through into the first team when he was assistant to then boss Louis van Gaal, believes the England man’s future lies away from Old Trafford.\n“I don’t think he looked happy at United,” said the former winger. “I think he looks happier now. For Marcus and for United, I think it’s best if they part ways. He’d be a brilliant player for someone, but I don’t know who.”\nGiggs moved on from United to Wales but stepped down from his position in 2022 after being charged with assault against a former partner and her sister.\nGiggs denied the charges and they were dropped after a jury failed to reach a verdict in an initial trial.\nThe 51-year-old had guided Wales to qualification for Euro 2020 but was not present during the tournament and has kept a low profile since.\n“It was heartbreaking (not being at Euro 2020),” said Giggs, who is currently director of football at Salford.\n“It was obviously a very difficult time because I’m watching it on TV. We scored late on and I’m jumping around the front room, and then all of a sudden, I look at the TV, and it’s all the staff and players jumping in the dugout, and I’m gone.”\n:: Listen to the full Rio Meets Ryan Giggs interview on Apple Podcasts and Spotify from 6am on Friday, April 25.",
