Pictured: Baoli\nRashford was left devastated after becoming one of the first casualties in Southgate's Euros culling.\nThe Manchester United forward, 26, has struggled for form this season, scoring seven goals and managing two assists in 33 league appearances.\nHe failed to make it into Southgate's 33-man training squad, which was later slimmed down to the final 26 destined for Germany.\nAnd while his teammates were taking part in their final few training sessions ahead of the tournament, Rashford appeared to be partying his sorrows away, dancing at an exclusive beach bar in Cannes.\nOnlookers said the 26-year-old dined out at the Baoli restaurant with up to 12 friends where they claim he spent around £3,700 on drinks and food on Saturday.\nThe trendy, beachfront outlet is the nightclub among the elite with it said to be a favourite spot for Eva Mendes, Jay Z and U2 frontman Bono.\nDiners said the £325,000-a-week star seemingly wasn't bothered by Gareth Southgate's snub as he was seen laughing and dancing for three hours before he left and headed to the club at the same venue at 1am.\nA fellow diner said he recognised Rashford's luxury Richard Mille watch.\nOnlookers said the 26-year-old dined out at the Baoli restaurant with up to 12 friends where they claim he spent around £3,700 on drinks and food\nDiners said the £325,000-a-week star seemingly wasn't bothered by Gareth Southgate 's snub as he was seen laughing and dancing for three hours before he left and headed to the club at the same venue at 1am\nThe Manchester United winger did not even make the provisional 33-man squad for Euro 2024 in Germany when it was announced in May\nHe said: 'When I was him I was like 'holy s**t that is Marcus Rashford'.\n'As soon as I saw him put his hand up and I saw the watch and chain I knew it was him.\n'Not making the England squad seemed not to bother him.\n'Throughout the night he was moving around the restaurant, with the assistance of management and a bodyguard I think.'\nRashford has endured a trying campaign in 2023-24 for Erik ten Hag's side, with only seven goals and two assists in the Premier League, after a hugely impressive 2022-23.\nAfter being snubbed by Southgate, he has taken a break from social media, tweeting on May 27 he needed to 'rest and reset' following a 'challenging season'.\nStaying true to his word, he has yet to post anything since then to his combined 24million followers over X and Instagram.\nRashford may also take the break to spend some more time on his love life.\nThe Manchester United star is thought to have been single since splitting with his teenage sweetheart Lucia Loi in the summer of 2023.\nThe then-couple, both 26, first started dating at the age of 15 while studying at Ashton on Mersey school in Greater Manchester, and Rashford proposed to Loi in May 2022 during a post-season get-away in California.\nBut the relationship is believed to have 'run its course' when the pair decided to separate a year later in June, with sources at the time claiming the couple remained 'very close friends'.\nLast month Rashford was spotted cosying up with Colombian-born model Erica Correa on a night out in Manchester on Sunday evening.\nMarcus Rashford is thought to have spent a night out with Colombian-born model Erica Correa\nThe 29-year-old grew up in Liverpool but has travelled the globe working as a model for a range of different brands\nRashford was described by a source as appearing to be 'having a ball' with Correa on Sunday\nIt came just weeks before he was dropped by Southgate from England's Euros squad and sparked speculation Rashford had now found a new partner.\nNeither have spoken publicly about their night out. But Rashford is said to have grown close with Correa - who moved to Liverpool as a five-year-old before being spotted on the streets of the city aged 13 and going on to have a glamorous modelling career.\nA source told the Sun: 'Whatever his form on the pitch, off of it Marcus is delivering the goods.\n'He looked like the cat that got the cream on Erica's arm. They were having a ball.\n'Marcus and Erica were tactile and clearly enjoying each other's company.'\nJordan Henderson\nHenderson was pictured on holiday in Portugal earlier this week with his wife Rebecca at a resort in the Algarve.\nThe pair looked in a relaxed mood in their gym gear before driving off in a golf buggy.\nHenderson has remained silent on social media for almost a month now, with his last post coming just the day before he and Rashford were announced as the first casualties to be cut from Southgate's Euros team.\nA day earlier the former Liverpool captain had paid tribute to his former club boss, Jürgen Klopp, who left after almost nine years at Anfield.\n'Thank you for everything Boss. @kloppo,' Henderson wrote.\nHis dumping from the Euros team was the last chapter in a bitter year of disappointments for the England midfielder.\nThe 33-year-old joined Al-Ettifaq in Saudi Arabia from Liverpool last summer but left them to join a struggling Ajax side in January.\nSouthgate continued to pick him after his move to the Saudi Pro League, though he was booed by some England fans on his first game back in the country, against Australia at Wembley in October.\nJordan Henderson and wife Rebecca Burnett were seen driving a golf buggy in the Algarve\nHenderson will not be taking part in Euro 2024 after losing his place in the England squad\nHenderson was in the squad for March friendlies against Brazil and Belgium but did not play.\nAnd he now faces a summer of uncertainty after a disastrous Ajax campaign which could threaten to see the star move again after just six months.\nThe midfielder's switch to the Dutch giant hasn't exactly gone to plan, despite his shirt becoming the club's fastest selling jersey of all time.\nThe club have suffered a nightmare season, with Henderson only making seven appearances as he's struggled for form and fitness since the move back to the Europe.\nAjax were knocked out of Europe by Aston Villa and suffered a humiliating 6-0 league defeat to Feyenoord before the season culminated in missing out on Champions League football.\nIt's the second season in a row Ajax has missed out on a place at Europe's top table of football.\nThe Champions League's new format next season, will see an extra £372million in prize money for the 36 teams involved for 2024/25, which Ajax now stand to miss out on.\nAccording to The Athletic, the financial hit means the future of big earners like Henderson face an uncertain future, given the financial problems at the Johan Cruyff Arena.\nThe pair looked in a relaxed mood in their gym gear on a sunny day in Portugal\nHenderson lost his place in Southgate's squad after years as a mainstay in the team\nLast month MailSport reported there was no desire for the former European champions to sell the likes of Henderson - but as one of the club's biggest earners, they could be forced to cash-in on their assets.\nDespite the gloom of the season, and missing out on a place in England's Euros squad – Henderson will have one thing to look forward: celebrating his 34th birthday.\nIt's not known how the football ace will mark the occasion, which comes the day after England's first game against Serbia on Sunday evening.\nBut he could choose to spend it with his wife, Rebecca and their three children, Alexa, Alba and Miles.\nBen Chilwell\nChilwell appeared in high spirits despite his Euro 2024 England snub.\nThe Chelsea full-back spent time living it up at the Monaco Grand Prix alongside fellow England teammate, Mason Mount – who also failed to make the squad travelling to Germany.\nThe pair have remained close friends since Mount departed Stamford Bridge in a £60m transfer to Old Trafford last summer and looked to be enjoying themselves in the baking Monaco sunshine.\nChilwell shared snaps of him partying in Monaco and enjoying a cruise on a yacht.\nThe England ace even took the time to chat to Sky Sports' Martin Brundle from inside the grid.\nBeaming, Chilwell said: 'It's good. It's very hot and very busy and very tight,' before going on to say he would be cheering on the Red Bull team who were 'looking after me'.\nManchester United's Mason Mount (right) was joined at the Monaco GP by Chelsea full-back Ben Chilwell (left)\nMason Mount and Ben Chilwell pose for a photo during the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco at Circuit de Monaco on May 26\nThe pair (pictured) have remained close friends since Mount departed Stamford Bridge\nChilwell has appeared in high spirits despite his Euro 2024 England snub\nHarry Maguire\nInjured Maguire was seen enjoying a luxury five-star hotel holiday in Turkey after missing out on a place in the Euros squad.\nThe Manchester United centre-back, capped 63 times by his country, was knocking back drinks by the poolside at the Maxx Royal Belek resort.\nThe resort where Maguire has been staying along with his family is a five-star golf and spa hotel, located on the coast of Belek.\nA room can set you back £554 a night for a suite or £865 for a two-bedroom family room - while the most deluxe accommodation there costs up to £6,400 per night.\nA fellow holiday-goer, who spotted Maguire, said: 'He is in very good spirits.\n'He is looking very relaxed. He must have booked the holiday very last minute - they only announced the squad a few days ago.'\nMaguire, 31, has previously been a mainstay of Southgate's side - scoring at both the 2018 World Cup and the previous European Championship in 2021.\nEngland and Manchester United defender Harry Maguire (right) has been seen holidaying in Turkey after missing out on selection for this summer's European Championship in Germany\nHe has been seen at the Maxx Royal Belek resort in Turkey, spending time there with family\nMaguire told of his heartache in a message to his 5.3million fans on Instagram last week.\n'I am devastated not to have been selected to play for England at the Euros this summer,' he wrote.\n'Despite my best efforts, I have not been able to overcome an injury to my calf. Maybe I pushed myself too hard, to try and make it. Simply, I am absolutely gutted.'\nAlthough heartbroken, Maguire appeared to rally around his fellow teammates, insisting he would now support the lads 'as a fan – along with the rest of the country'. 'Go and win it boys,' he added.\n'For me, representing England is the highest honour. It means everything to me. If I can't help the team as a player, I will support them as a fan – along with the rest of the country. Go and win it boys.'\nHe said he would be returning to the supervision of Man U's medical team to try and prepare him for next season and recover.\nAnd although he will be looking to focus on his fitness, Maguire might take time out to enjoy a key marriage milestone with his wife, Fern Hawkins.\nThe couple's second wedding anniversary is on June 25 – the day of England's third and final group match against Slovenia.\nManchester United's Harry Maguire is seen here with partner Fern Hawkins during Euro 2020\nMaguire, seen playing for England against Brazil in March, has won 63 caps for his country\nIt could be a juggling act for Maguire to celebrate the union and support his teammates, who kick off at 8pm.\nThe pair could spend the day with their two children, Lillie Saint, four, and Piper Rose, three, at the £4million Cheshire mansion – or they might even take a last-minute trip overseas to celebrate the anniversary.\nHarry, who comes from a close-knit family, is likely to take the time over the summer break to see his loved ones.\nHis parents Zoe and Alan Maguire are among his biggest fans, along with his siblings, Joe, Laurence and Daisy who have previously been snapped watching the Man U talisman's matches.\nMason Mount\nManchester United ace Mount appeared to take news of his failure to make Southgate's squad in good spirits.\nThe 25-year-old, who is reportedly on a £250,000-a-week salary at United, was still flying high after his club side's FA Cup victory against local rivals, Manchester City.\nMount failed to make England's 33-man training squad last month, having endured a difficult first season at United - where he was given the club's legendary No.7 shirt upon joining - battling with numerous injuries and making only 20 appearances across all competitions, scoring just one goal in the process.\nHowever, he was fit to play a part in the FA Cup final showdown at Wembley and came off the bench in the third minute of stoppage time as manager Erik ten Hag sought to run the clock down.\nNow on his summer break, the sports star joined some of his Man U teammates on a last-dash trips over to Monaco for the Formula One Grand Prix after celebrating their FA Cup title win deep into the early hours.\nMason Mount, Red Bull Racing Team Principal Christian Horner, Phil Foden and Ruben Dias pose for a photo prior to qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco\nMount also bagged a couple of snaps with South African rugby captain Siya Kolisi (left) and Jodie Porter during the F1 Grand Prix of Monaco at Circuit de Monaco on May 26\nMount posed for pictures during a round of golf as a five-star resort in Ireland\nMount lapped up the lavish event at the Monte Carlo circuit on May 26 with his fellow England teammate, Ben Chilwell -

which will be hosting the 2027 Ryder Cup competition - and where a one-night bed and breakfast stay in its 'Signature one-bedroom suit' could cost almost £6,600.\nJack Grealish\nJack Grealish was spotted letting his hair down with friends in Dubai after sensationally missing out on a spot in the England squad.\nThe Manchester City legend was pictured being ushered through a luxury hotel in the Middle Eastern paradise towards a beach bar.\nWearing yellow shorts and a top, video footage of the England ace appear to show him looking a little unsteady on his feet at one point.\nA friend from Grealish's entourage held onto his arm, before a pal was later seen placing an arm around the player's waist and leading him along.\nOnlookers at the five-star Jumeirah Beach Hotel were reportedly told by security not to take photos as Grealish and his pals exited the luxury building before jumping into a buggy which whisked them towards the resort's beach bar.\nThere was no sign of the multi-millionaire's girlfriend Sasha Attwood in his tight-knit group.\nOne onlooker told The Sun: 'It looked like the rejection by Gareth Southgate had hit hard.'\nThey added: 'He's clearly taking time to work through his Euros rejection...At least he had his friends around him.'\nAmong those missing out is Manchester City's £100million playmaker Jack Grealish\nJack Grealish celebrates with his girlfriend Sasha Attwood after Manchester City won the Premier League\nGrealish celebrates with a bottle of champagne during the Manchester City trophy parade on May 26, 2024\nJack Grealish leaves the Manchester City party at Fenix restaurant and bar at 5am on Monday 20 May\nJames Maddison\nThe Tottenham talisman was 'devastated' to have missed out on a place in England's squad for the European Championships.\nHe is now thought to be taking some time out to enjoy family life with his partner Kennedy Alexa, and their children Delilah, Rome and Leo over the summer.\nBut opening up about his disappointment not to have made the England squad, the 27-year-old winger told his 456,000 followers on X: 'Devastated doesn't quite cut it,\n'Trained well and worked hard all week. But if I'm honest with myself, my form for Spurs when coming back from injury in the second half of the season probably wasn't at the levels I had set which gave Gareth a decision to make.\n'I still thought there would be a space for me in a 26-man squad as I feel I bring something different & had been a mainstay in this whole qualifying campaign for Euro 2024 in Germany.\n'But the manager has made the decision and I have to respect that.\n'I'll be back, I have no doubt.'\nMaddison wished his teammates well but has remained silent on social media since.\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying\n- Glamorous Olympic skating star masterfully avoids disaster\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Leo Ross's killer unmasked: Thug who stabbed schoolboy to death named\n- Moment hi-viz thugs attack bin men in terrifying mass brawl",
