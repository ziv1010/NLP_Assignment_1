With manager Ange Postecoglou at the helm, the Bhoys are chasing a treble this season and the semi-final will be a crucial test of their mettle.\nIn a recent CelticTV press conference, Postecoglou revealed that the club is already active and working on deals for the summer transfer window, indicating that there are big plans in the works for Celtic’s future. Fans will be eagerly watching to see how the team performs in the Scottish Cup and what signings may be on the horizon.",
