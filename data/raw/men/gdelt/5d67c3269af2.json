  "body_text": "In a highly anticipated Champions League semi-final clash between Bayern Munich and Real Madrid, Thomas Tuchel, the manager of Bayern Munich, shared his thoughts and insights in today’s pre-game press conference at the Allianz Arena. With both teams eager to secure a favorable position in the first leg, Tuchel provided a glimpse into his squad’s readiness, tactical approach, and reflections on Real Madrid’s key players.\nTuchel: “Musiala and Sané will be a last minute decision”\nThe German also gave his insights on tomorrow’s tactical approach\nWho is fit and who is injured for his squad?\n“I don’t know one hundred percent. We have to wait to know the results of the latest tests. Laimer looks good, we’ll see what happens with the rest. Patience. I think it’s too early for De Ligt and Upamecano. As for Jamal (Musiala) and Leroy (Sane), they will be a last minute decision”\nOn Jude Bellingham\n“I don’t like to talk about individual players, at the end they are different profiles that play as a team. Jude’s evolution is incredible, he has a lot of character, especially taking into account how much that shield usually weighs. But he accepts it. He is a differential player, we are aware of this and we will try to stop him.”\nHow will Bayern approach the game?\n“It depends on tactics, on luck, but also on coming out freely. Tactics are always a tool. It’s like a car, but we are the ones driving it. The players also have certain ideas throughout a match and they have to feel the freedom to be able to pass them on the pitch. It takes a mix of luck, moments and quality to eliminate a team of the stature of Real Madrid. And if luck has to be challenged, we will challenge it.\n“These are two early finals. And I will propose an eleven for a final. We will not field players who are not ready for 90 minutes. I will not think about the second leg because many things can happen in the first leg that will be decisive for the second game. We will do everything possible to win and there will be time to think about the return later”\nOn Carlo Ancelotti:\n“His way of being, his CV and his experience make him a kind of father for his players. Each one has to follow the path they are convinced of. I don’t think the only thing he does is choose eleven players and that’s it. What he does is not a game of chance. We are going to focus on the content, offer easy solutions and play with a certain freedom.\n“Ancelotti is a legend and what he has given to football is incredible. He is a humble and respectful guy, a gentleman from head to toe. So in general, we will play against the shirt and against the myth. Therefore, I think the best thing we can do is focus on the football content when preparing for the game.”\nWhat’s changed sine he last faced Real Madrid?\n“My games with Chelsea against Madrid were the most recent. What has changed is that Benzema is no longer there, he was the great reference in attack. They have compensated for this by changing the scheme somewhat and turning Bellingham into a kind of all-rounder who occupies many positions throughout a match. However, their behavior on the pitch remains very similar for players like Kroos or Modric, who have been leading the charge for a long time.\n“Vinicius and Rodryo are both very good, but different. Rodrygo usually scores key goals, he already did it against my Chelsea. Vinicius usually starts more from the wing, faces and accelerates, he is very clinical in all his actions. I love Brazilian players like them.”",
