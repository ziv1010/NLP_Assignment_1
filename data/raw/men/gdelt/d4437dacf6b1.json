It was his home for two years as manager of Inter between May 2019-2021, during which time he claimed Inter’s first Serie A title in 11 years.\nSuffice to say, he knows every inch of one of world football’s cathedrals, and you certainly feel he is relishing the challenge of leading us into battle against Inter’s city rivals, AC Milan, in this evening’s Champions League Round of 16, first leg (8pm UK).\n“For sure, I have good memories,” Antonio told SPURSPLAY at his pre-match media duties at the stadium on Monday evening. “After 21 months, I’m back at the San Siro with Tottenham, and I’m proud to be here with my Club, especially because we are going to play an important game in the Champions League. I have a lot of good memories, but this is another story, we have to try to play a good game and try to get a good result.”\nMilan ended a run of indifferent form with a 1-0 win against Torino on Friday. Italian champions last season, they are currently fifth, fully 18 points adrift of leaders Napoli. Stefano Pioli’s team qualified for the knockout stage by finishing second behind Chelsea in Group E.\n“It will be a tough game,” added Antonio. “We are talking about a team that last season won the league, and, in Italy, to win when the other competitors are Inter, Juventus, Naples, Rome, Lazio, it means you did something special.\n“The atmosphere will be an important atmosphere, because to play in the San Siro is incredible, you enjoy this, but, at the same time, it can put you under a lot of pressure. We have to face this game in the right way from the start until the end.”\nI’m proud to be here with my Club, especially because we are going to play an important game in the Champions League\nAntonio on... his health\n“I’m feeling better, not still 100 per cent, I’m recovering and the doctor said to me to stay calm, to stay at home for the first 15 days, but honestly, my sense of responsibility and the will to decide to stay with the players and the team brought me to come back early, but, at the same time, I have to pay great attention because only 10 days ago I had surgery, but I’m okay because I stay with the team, I stay in the Tottenham environment and I’m happy when I stay in the situation that I like.”\nAntonio on... team news\n“In the last weeks, everything happened. I started with my surgery, then Hugo, a serious injury against City, then surgery with Bissouma and now Rodrigo. It’s a big, big loss for us, but I don’t want these losses to become an alibi for us. We have two young players, Olly Skipp and Pape Sarr, to play in midfield. We trust them. We have to be good to help them overcome the emotion and to feel the confidence, to be comfortable to play. We are talking about two players, really good prospects, this is the first games (starts) in the Champions League for both but, at the same time, they have worked with us for a long time and my expectation is to see a good game.”",
