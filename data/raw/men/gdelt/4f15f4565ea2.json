  "body_text": "Not to come over all Pardew but these four could all feel like new Newcastle United signings\nNow we are in between seasons, we wanted to get a Newcastle United fans snapshot of opinion.\nThe idea is to get a range of views of what various Mag writers (Newcastle United fans) think about what has happened and the current position.\nThen most importantly, what is going to happen at Newcastle United moving forward.\nSo we have sent various regular and irregular contributors sets of questions, including some the same as others, some different.\nNext up we have Jamie Smith:\nYour thoughts on each of the signings made in 2023 and how you see their role (if any), their importance (or not) for the 2024/25 season – Gordon, Minteh, Livramento, Hall, Tonali, Barnes\nGordon is obviously one of the stars now, with scope to grow more so if he does well at the Euros and his contribution is vital. Maybe needs to take that home form on the road more.\nMinteh seems touch and go – could be here, could be loaned, could be sold. It may depend on how the pursuit of other right wingers go as it could be a viable and PSR savvy option to give him a shot in the Premier League, whether that’s close to the starting XI or as a back up.\nLivramento will, for me, surpass Trippier as first choice RB this year. He’s probably the biggest success of last summer’s signings and will be in that role for a few years to come.\nHall came on a storm at the end of the season, his age may mean he’s in and out a bit (with Kelly, Burn and Trippier all potential options) and he’s not the finished article, but as with Tino he could be the long term answer in his position.\nTonali is the one of course. Massively disappointing the way things went and probably cost us dearly. Now he’s speaking English and fully integrated, I expect him to hit the ground running and start making amends for the indiscretions gone by.\nBarnes is a great player and I hope the injury problem last year was a freak one. I currently have him down as a terrific game changer off the bench which I’m sure he’ll not relish but I’d be happy with him in a starting berth.\nNot to come over all Pardew, but last summer’s quartet should feel like new signings this year.\nIf you could have a totally free choice, which 19 other clubs would you like to have in the Premier League with Newcastle United?\nNot even joking, I think about this a lot.\nAs someone who goes to away games, I maintain a geographical leaning (e.g. this season’s cow pat of a PL is a travellers nightmare) but I also believe football is for the fans and it feels wrong that a couple of million Leeds supporting households feel miserable while 2,000 hardcore and a bunch of fairweather spectators get the benefits of Bournemouth and Brentford taking a place. With all that in mind I’ll go for:\nNewcastle\nLiverpool\nArsenal\nTottenham\nMan City\nMan Utd\nAston Villa\nEverton\nChelsea\nWest Ham\nLeeds\nLeicester\nNottingham Forest\nSheffield Wednesday\nSheffield Utd\nSunderland (howay, let’s not be spiteful)\nDerby\nBurnley\nWest Brom (do they still have that pub that does the tandoori?)\nSouthampton (south coast can have one token representative).\nPredict the top five in the Premier League (in order).\nBit early mind.\nI’ll say Man City, Arsenal, Newcastle, Liverpool, Man U.\nTransitional seasons to cost Scousers, Spurs seem to have realised they’re rubbish, Villa to be completely undone by the Champions League games and Chelsea just a basket case.\nThe three most improved NUFC players as we look froward to the 2024/25 season?\nDepends where you start from.\nFrom the start of last season it’s Hall and Livramento, look back over the whole Howe era and you’ve got Joelinton, Schar, Murphy.\nAny way you slice the list though, Anthony Gordon surely has to be on it. The difference between other fans mocking us saying Everton had got one over us for £45m, to him being at the European Championships after a fantastic season, is a credit to the lad and the NUFC management. Anyone doubting any transfer should hark back to this deal and take the learning to shut their mouth (James Trafford being particularly pertinent here). To give a proper answer, I’ll say AG and England’s two future full backs for their progress the last 12 months.\nThe current NUFC player that you have been proved most wrong about?\nI’ve not doubted any of the signings, so haven’t had egg on my face like many a reactionary daftie will have, so my answer’s a bit different.\nI’m going to say Martin Dubravka, because I thought he could be a vital part of the squad and more than capable to step in for Pope at any time after his Man Utd transgression. It proved costly how out of step he was with the team’s style as we shipped a barrel of silly and/or avoidable goals.\nIs it still a Premier League big six, or is it seven (incl NUFC), or is it an eight (incl NUFC and Villa)?\nFinancially, it’s still a big six, although I’ve always thought Tottenham’s place in this group was a bit generous.\nCompetitively, I believe the various challenges and noises against PSR restrictions means it will soon become way more feasible to quickly close any gaps, but the season ahead will be an interesting one. I’ve said before that the European misstep might turn to our benefit, whereas Villa could have the opposite experience, as they juggle lengthy Champions League commitments.\nPress a magic button and have a 62,000 capacity enlarged St James’ Park in place, or a brand new 80,000 capacity stadium just up the road at Castle Leazes ?\nIf it’s Castle Leazes, yes I’ll take the bigger one, but I’d be sticking at 62k if it was further afield.\nHang on, this is hypothetical button aye? Just it’s took six months to build about half of the Stack.\nUpcoming 2024/25 season, would you rather win League Cup or finish Premier League top four?\nLeague Cup please. Still gets Europe and I’ll exploit the loophole in the question that we can still come fifth and get the CL place that may be on offer for that. Checkmate.\nNext three seasons, would you rather finish top four all three seasons BUT win nothing, or finish mid-table all three seasons AND win the League Cup in one of the three?\nThat’s different to a one off.\nIt’s degenerative to slump back to mid-table so steady Champions League progress and trophy in the fourth season is more on track\nWith the summer business you are anticipating, what could NUFC be capable of next season?\nSo many variables.\nThe Man City court case on associated party transactions could kick down some doors if they’re successful. Alternatively, if their own indiscretions are punished with the 115 charges hanging over them, they could find they’re vulnerable and I’d reiterate that lack of European fixtures could provide real energy and focus for a challenge at the very top.\nThe decisive factor will be avoiding anything like the injury horrors of last year and the team clicking in a way that eradicates some of the worrying displays like Palace, Brighton, Man Utd away. I’m going to say things look positive from where we are right now though.\nWould you like to draw Sunderland again in one of the cups this coming season?\nMassively, 100% yes.\nThe derby in January was one of the most enjoyable, cathartic days I’ve had at the match in years. I loved how that win not only exercised some demons from the six in a row but obliterated mackem fantasies that Newcastle weren’t that good and their bright young team would give us a game.\nThey are painfully aware of this now and will be sat dreading the prospect of any cup draw they happen to be in with us. I would absolutely love a tie at St James’ Park to inflict another slapping on them before they disappear off back to League three or whatyoucallit next season and start going out again before we come in the cups again.\nWhat do you think Eddie Howe’s first choice eleven will be next season, with all the current squad available and the summer signings you think will be made. So if you think in a position a summer signing will be Eddie’s first choice, please just put ‘summer signing’.\nSo the XI would be:\nPope, Livramento, Hall, Schar, Botman (when fit, Burn to start season), Bruno, Joelinton, Tonali, Gordon, New Signing/Minteh, Isak\nI think other new signings (Kelly, striker, right side CB) will be options used off the bench for the majority of this season other than the right wing slot, although we may well see the Livramento/Hall situation where they secure their starting places by the end of the season.\nScale of 1-10, how interested in England at the Euros?\nSolid 7 I’d say.\nI love the major tournaments with their constant games and the ability to follow a side without the anxiety and torture of NUFC being involved.\nWould be canny if England were to win it, if they don’t though, I’ll sharp get over it.\nHow much of a difference, if any, does it make having two NUFC players in the squad and/or England playing at SJP for a change in the warm up friendly v Bosnia?\nHaving United players there is a big factor, although the “player cam” effect can happen where you watch them specifically and not the game as a whole, which is something I often annoy myself by doing.\nWas pleased they turned out at SJP, although my own interest was minimal for an international friendly. I was actually playing football myself at the foundation building when the game was on and looked a bit odd walking along with the crowd in a full Newcastle away kit with my boots slung over my shoulder. People must have thought I was a massively deluded optimist hoping Gareth might give me the nod.\nYou can follow the author on Twitter @Mr_Dolf\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
