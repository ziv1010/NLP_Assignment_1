  "body_text": "Following the departure of Antonio Conte by mutual agreement, a new acting head coach, Cristian Stellini, has been appointed at Tottenham. Taking over the role is a 48-year-old who is already familiar to Spurs fans, having managed the team earlier this season while Conte was recovering from gallbladder surgery. Alongside assistant head coach Ryan Mason, he will be responsible for leading the club to Champions League qualification for the rest of the season. So, who exactly is this man tasked with the job of guiding Tottenham to success?\nAll About Cristian Stellini:\nCristian Stellini is a former Italian footballer who spent his entire playing career in Italy, starting at Novara in 1992. He played for lower-league teams such as Spal, Ternana, and Como before moving to Juventus in 2003. However, his time at Juventus was cut short due to a serious leg injury, which limited his appearances for the club. Stellini went on to play for Genoa and Bari, where he retired from professional football.\nAfter retiring, Stellini became an assistant manager to Antonio Conte at Siena in 2010/11, helping the club gain promotion to Serie A. He followed Conte to Juventus later that year, but his time there was plagued by allegations of match-fixing from his time at Bari, resulting in a two-and-a-half-year suspension by the Italian Football Federation. Stellini resigned as a technical assistant at Juventus in 2012, but he returned to the profession as a youth coach at Genoa from 2015 to 2017, before taking up his only permanent senior post as manager of Alessandria in 2017/18.\nAfter rejoining Antonio Conte as an assistant manager at Inter Milan in 2019, Stellini helped guide the team to their first Scudetto in 11 years. Stellini joined Tottenham as an assistant manager when Conte was appointed in November 2021 and first took charge of a Spurs game in the Champions League group stage, leading the team to victory over Marseille in France.\nDuring Antonio Conte's absence following his surgery, Stellini took over as the temporary manager of Tottenham. His second spell in the role began with a significant 1-0 win over Manchester City on February 5, which was followed by victories against West Ham and Chelsea. However, Stellini's reign was also marred by a disappointing FA Cup loss to Championship side Sheffield United.\nQ1. What position did Antonio Conte use to play?\nMidfielder.\nQ2. Tottenham Hotspur Football Club is based in which country?\nEngland.\nAll About Cristian Stellini:\nCristian Stellini is a former Italian footballer who spent his entire playing career in Italy, starting at Novara in 1992.
