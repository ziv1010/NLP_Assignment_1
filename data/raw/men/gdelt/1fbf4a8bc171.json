  "body_text": "The (Greek) Transfer of the Century: For 40 million euros, Kostoulas to Brighton (vid+pics)\nOlympiacos gave the green light, and Babis Kostoulas entered the top 5 of the most expensive 18-year-olds in the history of football.\n- Πάτρα: Δασκάλα χαστούκισε 8χρονο που βρίσκεται στο φάσμα του αυτισμού γιατί… «έκανε θόρυβο»\n- Η κυβέρνηση Τραμπ μηνύει ξανά το Χάρβαρντ – Στο επίκεντρο η εισαγωγή φοιτητών «βάσει φυλής»\n- Ο φυλακισμένος Ιμάμογλου προκαλεί τον Ερντογάν να προκηρύξει πρόωρες εκλογές τώρα\n- Ρωσία: Τουλάχιστον δύο άμαχοι νεκροί από ουκρανική πυραυλική επίθεση στο Μπέλγκοροντ\nTwo Fridays ago, exactly on May 30th, he opened the door to adulthood: “Babis Kostoulas, aged 18,” we said about the wonderkid of Greek football who, before even gaining the right to apply for a driver’s license, became a European champion (Youth League) and double winner of Greece with Olympiacos — in a perfect football journey, the kind you’d think someone dreamed up with their eyes wide open.\nAnd today, Friday the 13th of June? The son of Thanasis — who also wrote his own story against a Red-and-White backdrop — now stands atop the highest… mountain ever climbed by a Greek footballer. Holder of a series of records and a trailblazer for the next in his generation. The wonderkid for whom Brighton laid a forty-million-euro (and counting) carpet at his feet.\nWelcome to the Albion, Charalampos! 💙🤍 pic.twitter.com/xb8PJI6TbS\n— Brighton & Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC) June 12, 2025\nAs if to say: The second most expensive transfer of an 18-year-old in Premier League history. The fifth most expensive transfer of an 18-year-old in the history of European football. The second most expensive transfer in Brighton’s history.\nThe most expensive for a Greek footballer\nThe most expensive (Greek and foreign) in the Greek Super League\nNaturally, the most expensive one for Olympiacos as well, who once again showed and proved that the way they think about and implement football is a case study. Seven years ago, the Piraeus club changed the landscape for Greek footballers and the value of the development process in our country, launching — their now captain — Panagiotis Retsos into the stratosphere of the Bundesliga for €17.5 million (to Bayer Leverkusen):\nAn amount that seemed beyond reason. Four years later, Kostas Tsimikas left the football factory of Rentis directly for Liverpool in a move that didn’t surpass Retsos financially (€13 million), but which “strategically” opened the door to football’s elite.\nThere were higher offers on the table. However, Evangelos Marinakis wanted not only to reward Tsimikas himself but also to unlock yet another level for Greek football. A homegrown Olympiacos academy player joining — what many consider — the most important club in English football.\nAnd since last night? The next representative of Olympiacos’ development pipeline in the Premier League has already set the Island abuzz. The Greek teenager for whom €40 million was spent! The 5th most expensive transfer of an 18-year-old in football history — in case that wasn’t clear enough.\nThe tough negotiations lasted an entire month — aiming to secure the best possible terms for Babis Kostoulas, as well as to reflect the true magnitude of a deal like this. Just a year ago, Kostoulas, leading Olympiacos’ incredible youth team, strung together victories over elite sides like Inter, Bayern Munich, and AC Milan, guiding the Reds to their Youth League triumph.\nAnd later, when he was promoted to the senior squad under José Luis Mendilibar? His data kept lighting up dashboards and building legions of admirers. After Lamine Yamal (0.67 per match), Argentina’s “new Messi” Franco Mastantuono (0.6), reportedly close to signing with Real Madrid from River Plate, and Andrija Maksimović (0.6) of Red Star Belgrade — tracked by Paris Saint-Germain — Kostoulas ranked as the 4th most efficient U-18 (winger and forward) in goal + assist creation (xG + xA) per 90 minutes in the 2024/25 season.\nAll of the above talents were born in the blessed year of 2007!\nKostoulas ✍️ 2⃣0⃣3⃣0⃣ pic.twitter.com/EtIJ9MSSbv\n— Brighton & Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC) June 12, 2025\nThis footballer was brought to Renti at the age of 12 by the top Greek club, together with his brother Konstantinos, who also lifted the Youth League and for the past year has been at Rio Ave playing in the Portuguese championship. This footballer is being sent at 18 to the planet of the Premier League. Olympiacos, which meanwhile won the double this year, having directly from its ranks, apart from Kostoulas and Retsos, the amazing Konstantis Tzolakis and Christos Mouzakitis in its starting 11.\nWho lifted the Conference League a year ago with its then captain, also from the Academy, Kostas Fortounis. And which, already opening the door to Babis Kostoulas, has taken care of the next one: His ‘buddy’ Antonis Papakanellos. Because of Babis, he played little in the 2024/25 season (5 appearances). Since March, however, he was rewarded with a big contract. And in a month from now, at the start of the preparation, the expectations from him are changing.\n“You can call me Babis!” 😁🤳 pic.twitter.com/N8eJ9bWYpv\n— Brighton & Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC) June 12, 2025\nShall we also leave here the names of Fanis Bakoulas, Stavros Pnevmonidis, and Argyris Liatsikouras, all European champions (Youth League 2024), who in turn are preparing to introduce themselves to the wider public? All of them children of the football reservoir of Renti. Of Olympiacos, which amidst all its small and great achievements, managed to create in its colors a top football academy as well. As Vangelis Marinakis was saying 15 years ago. Back then, when such days everything was starting…\n- Κύπρος: Καταγγελίες για μυστηριώδη ξανθιά γυναίκα με βαν που αρπάζει γάτες\n- ΗΠΑ: Δημοσιονομική παράλυση ενόψει για το υπουργείο Εσωτερικής Ασφάλειας\n- Single του Αγίου Βαλεντίνου; Πάρε μαθήματα από τον άνθρωπο των σπηλαίων\n- «Ανίκανος ο αμερικανικός στρατός» – Τα λόμπι πιέζουν τον Τραμπ για αγορά εκατοντάδων σουπερ-αεροπλάνων\n- Κίνα και ΕΕ είναι «εταίροι, όχι αντίπαλοι», λέει ο Ουάνγκ Γι\n- Το Πεντάγωνο φέρεται να χρησιμοποίησε το Claude της Anthropic στην επιδρομή κατά του Μαδούρο στη Βενεζουέλα\n- Καραϊβική: Νέο πλήγμα των ΗΠΑ εναντίον ταχύπλοου σκοτώνει τρεις επιβαίνοντες\n- Ουκρανία: Δεν έχω πειστεί ότι κάποια μέρα η Ρωσία θα κλείσει συμφωνία, λέει ο πρεσβευτής των ΗΠΑ στο ΝΑΤΟ\nΑκολουθήστε το in.gr στο Google News και μάθετε πρώτοι όλες τις ειδήσεις",
