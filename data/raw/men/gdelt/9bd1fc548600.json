  "body_text": "The recent 5-1 thrashing of the reigning Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) champions, Remo Stars of Ikenne by South African giants, Mamelodi Sundowns in Abeokuta in the first leg of the second preliminary round of the CAF Champions League is not only embarrassing, it has also lent credence to the suspicion in some quarters that the ‘Sky Blue’ boys were aided to win their first-ever NPFL title.\nAlthough they had suffered early exits in the continent in their previous appearances, many thought that having learnt useful lessons playing against some of the best clubs in the continent, Remo would use the present campaign to announce their arrival on Africa’s biggest stage. Unfortunately, their fate is now hanging by a thread as only a miracle would make them progress at the expense of the more illustrious and highly motivated Mamelodi Sundowns, who are poised to complete the job at home.\nConsidering how Remo Stars sustained their brilliant start to the 2024 NPFL season until they won the title, almost everyone in Nigeria believed that they would flex muscles against the big boys in the CAF Champions League. It will be recalled that with well-deserved away wins against Abia Warriors, Kano Pillars, Akwa United, Sunshine Stars and regional rivals 3SC, and away draws at Enyimba, Ikorodu City, as well as the now relegated Lobi Stars, Remo Stars successfully garnered 18 points on the road, the highest by any club in the 2024 season.\nInterestingly, Remo Stars didn’t suffer any home defeat in 38 matches as their worst results at home were the two draws against Rivers United and Katsina United in week 12 and 33, respectively. So, in 19 home matches, they dropped only two points. In fact, Remo Stars suffered only 11 defeats in the whole season. It is imperative to note that even formidable sides like Kano Pillars, Abia Warriors, and Akwa United suffered home and away defeats in the hands of the NPFL champions.\nIt was, therefore, not surprising that the ‘Sky Blue’ stormed to their first-ever title in style with three matches to the end of the season. Remo Stars had opened an unassailable 10-point gap when they defeated Niger Tornadoes 1-0 in week 35 to amass 68 points. Their closest rivals, Rivers United, had suffered a painful 0-2 loss at Kano Pillars to remain at 58 points, meaning that Remo Stars had to beat Tornadoes to clinch the title. It was a nervy moment, but Remo Stars’ best player of the season, Olamilekan Adedayo, scored the decisive goal at the death to give them the historic title.\nHonestly, it was difficult to question Remo Stars’ victory, yet a few football stakeholders alleged that it was facilitated by the magnanimity of their proprietor, Kunle Soname. Those who know closely say he is generous to a fault. Therefore, there was this feeling in some quarters that Remo Stars were getting some of the results as a reward for his magnanimity and tangible contributions to football development in Nigeria.\nBut amidst such suspicion, Remo Stars recorded impressive results, both at home and on the road, making many believe that their victory wasn’t artificial or fabricated. However, the scandalous defeat suffered by the club in the hands of Mamelodi Sundowns and the poor performance of the Remo Stars-dominated CHAN Eagles at this year’s African Nations Championship has revived the doubts that trailed their emergence as NPFL champions.\nThe match against Mamelodi Sundowns was a golden opportunity for the Nigerian champions to justify their title, but ‘Sky Blue’ lads melted without a fight. Right in front of their home fans, they were beaten like an amateur team that found its way into an elite competition by mistake. It was indeed another sad commentary on Nigerian football. After the match, many asked if Remo Stars truly deserved to win the league title.\nAs if he had a premonition of what was to come, a few days to the massacre in Abeokuta, the proprietor of Remo Stars granted an interview in which he said categorically that Nigerian clubs lacked the financial muscle to compete against the big clubs in the continent. He declared that it would require a miracle for Nigerian players who are paid poor salaries in the highly devalued naira to withstand their counterparts whose payment is usually in dollars. According to him, the gap between Nigerian clubs and some of the top clubs in Africa is wide and worrisome.\nConsequently, when the better-motivated Sundowns whitewashed his boys in the Champions League preliminary round match, many people concluded that Soname had foreseen the embarrassing defeat. However, it is still difficult to understand how a club like Remo Stars, which boasts of the best structure among the clubs in the NPFL, faltered like Kwara United and Abia Warriors, who exited the continent even before the blast of the whistle.\nWhen the two clubs were dumped out of the Confederation Cup at the first preliminary round stage, many of us believed Remo Stars would wipe away our tears. In fact, when the Ikenne boys were paired with Mamelodi Sundowns, we thought that Nigeria’s dominance over South Africa would prevail. Sadly, it wasn’t to be as Remo Stars were instead taught some lessons in elite football.\nSo, at the moment, Nigerians are left to wonder if Rivers United who finished as runners-up and are on the verge of making it to the CAF Champions League group stage after a slim 0-1 loss away to Black Bulls of Mozambique deserved to win the NPFL title. Indeed, the “Pride of Rivers” gave Remo Stars a hot chase for the title.\nOf course, five away wins in a league synonymous with the infamous home team-must-win syndrome underscored Remo Stars’ dominance in the NPFL and a chance to do well in the continent, but how they crumbled like a pack of cards before Mamelodi Sundowns, only heaven knows.\nIf it were possible to abandon the return leg, that would have been the only way for Remo Stars to avoid another beating. But the second leg must be honoured, which is giving supporters of the club sleepless nights. Even as it is said in football that it is not over until it is all over, such motivational quotes may not work in the case of Remo Stars, who have a mountain to climb on Sunday, October 26 at the Lucas Moripe Stadium.\nAs it is, the only thing Remo Stars can do is earn a respectable result. Even as they won’t be able to upturn the first leg result, returning home with a truckload of goals would be unacceptable. If they can get at least a draw in the return leg against the Brazilians of South Africa, to some extent, it would help redeem part of their battered image.\nUPDATE NEWS:\nNigerians can now invest ₦2.5 million on premium domains and profit about ₦17-₦25 million.
