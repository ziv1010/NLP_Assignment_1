Everyone at Feyenoord knew it would be very hard for the new coach.”\nMatt Wade, Feyenoord’s former head of sporting strategy, agrees. “Arne made us very competitive when we were still spending significantly less than Ajax and PSV. Replicating that was always going to be difficult,” he tells The Athletic.\nIn Slot’s place came Priske, a Dane who had transformed the fortunes of Sparta Prague in the Czech Republic, delivering two consecutive league titles after a long period when bitter rivals Slavia Prague and Viktoria Plzen dominated domestically. At Sparta, he deployed a 3-4-3 formation, much like Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, with overlapping wing-backs and wingers coming infield.\nAdvertisement\nPutting faith in the formation that brought him success at Sparta, Priske’s reign in the Netherlands started with an exciting 4-4 draw with PSV in the Johan Cruyff Shield (the Dutch Super Cup) that Feyenoord won on penalties.\nDespite going unbeaten in the league until the end of October, there was a feeling internally that his 3-4-3 setup did not suit Feyenoord’s players, who had tended to play 4-2-3-1 under Slot.\n“You need very different players to play that formation and we just didn’t have them,” Wade, who left Feyenoord in the summer to join Angel City in the United States, says. “It took about three or four weeks and then he changed it back and started to have some success with it.”\nAway from the system struggles, Feyenoord were also dealing with several important staff departures.\nSlot took assistant Sipke Hulshoff — an influential and impressive figure on the training ground — with him to Liverpool, as well as performance coach Ruben Peeters and video analyst Roderick van der Ham, who arrived at Merseyside in November. Leigh Egger, Feyenoord’s other head of performance, who was well regarded at the club, left to take up a role with the Australia national side.\nGO DEEPER\nMeet Sipke Hulshoff, Liverpool's clipboard-wielding 'field coach'\nThere was a sense Priske tried to change too much, too soon. “Even the things that had made us so successful, like the medical performance periodisation, which helped create one of the fittest teams in Europe, he completely changed it,” Wade explains.\n“He changed the periodisation (when and how they train) at the start of pre-season and then realised that it wasn’t working. Two to three weeks into pre-season, he went to the medical performance staff and said, ‘No, let’s do it your way’, but your pre-season is already disrupted.”\nUnder the previous regime, Slot’s intense style meant his players needed to be supremely fit, yet Feyenoord’s player availability was at 90 per cent or above in each of his three seasons in charge. He put his faith in specialists within the club to get the peak performance from every individual. Staff spoke about how players enjoyed training sessions, regularly led by Hulshoff, that were stimulating and fun.\nAdvertisement\n“They hit the sweet spot of overload, tactics and physical demand,” Egger told The Athletic in a previous interview.\nPriske’s time in charge was dominated by injury problems — only Igor Paixao, Feyenoord’s exciting Brazilian winger, has played in every league game this season. The sidelined players include key figures Quinten Timber, Ayase Ueda and Mexico striker Santiago Gimenez, who joined Milan for €32million (£26.8m at current exchange rates) last month.\nCommunication was another crucial skill Slot showed.\n“His player management is unique — humane and thoughtful,” Feyenoord’s CEO Dennis te Kloese previously told The Athletic. “He gives players a clear game plan, so players feel safe under him.”\nPsychologist Dan Abrahams, who worked with Slot at Feyenoord, agrees. “What sets Arne apart is that he’s a wonderful communicator,” he told The Athletic last year. “He knows how to get his point across to inform the players and they take confidence from seeing his preparedness. He knows his plans and they are adaptable.”\nIn that same piece, we reported how those close to Slot said he had a ‘bulls***’ radar but, at the same time, was open to ideas and listened to those he trusted.\nPriske, described by those who worked with him as a polite, approachable and caring individual, was usually eloquent in his dealings with the media and had a different style to Slot’s more direct methods.\nHe was very social, empathetic, talked a lot with the players and gave them a lot of influence. Despite that, however, he struggled to fully win around the group — the club statement on his exit talked about a “lack of chemistry” — and could not match Slot’s in-game management expertise. One staff member, who wished to remain anonymous to protect relationships, told The Athletic how some players were bemused by his constant swearing in team talks, for example.\nAdvertisement\nPriske also inherited a Feyenoord squad without holding midfielder Mats Wieffer, who was integral to their success and defensive solidity under Slot but joined Brighton & Hove Albion in the summer for £25million ($32m). Yankuba Minteh’s loan spell from Newcastle the previous campaign ended, and he too joined Brighton. Full-back Lutsharel Geertruida left to join RB Leipzig for a reported fee of £20m.\nFeyenoord’s business model revolves around selling their best players at top market value and reinvesting the money in talented, largely under-the-radar young players. In the summer, they signed 10 players for the senior squad, with Hwang In-beom and on-loan Hugo Bueno the standout performers of the recruits — although they have both picked up injuries. Others, such as Chris-Kevin Nadje, have flattered to deceive.\nAfter that sticky start, Priske’s reign at Feyenoord became a tale of inconsistency and false dawns. They had some memorable results, especially in Europe, including a remarkable 3-3 comeback draw at Manchester City and a 3-0 home win against Bayern Munich.\nBut they lost twice to Ajax in the league, were beaten by PSV in the Eredivisie and the KNVB Cup, and were humiliated 6-1 away to Lille in their final Champions League league-phase match.\nThere were struggles defensively. In Priske’s 33 matches in charge, they kept just five clean sheets, with goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther coming under scrutiny from the club’s fans.\nAfter an underwhelming 1-1 draw away to Willem II on January 18, Priske had a heated exchange with journalists. He also said, “I feel the fire within myself but not from my players.” That led to Dutch newspapers calling him a “dead man walking”.\nHe clung on and oversaw the Bayern win, but he was on borrowed time. Following three consecutive defeats, he was dismissed. In their statement, Feyenoord cited “the inconsistent results and a lack of chemistry as the main reasons” for his departure, adding “we see too little structural progress”.\nA source close to Priske declined to comment when approached by The Athletic for this article.\nAdvertisement\nFollowing Priske’s dismissal, former player Pascal Bosschaart, coach of Feyenoord’s under-21s, was installed as their interim manager.\nDespite an injury crisis that ruled out 10 players, Bosschaart masterminded Feyenoord’s victory against Milan in their previous Champions League knockout tie. They won 1-0 at home, with their goal coming from star player Paixao, who was signed from Brazilian side Coritiba in 2022 and is now on the radar of Europe’s biggest clubs.\nThey then drew 1-1 at the San Siro after going behind to a goal from their former striker, Gimenez. Successfully through to the last 16, Bosschaart could pass the baton to decorated former striker Van Persie on February 23.\nVan Persie, whose 18-year-old son Shaqueel plays in Feyenoord’s academy, was joined by the experienced Rene Hake as his assistant, who most recently worked under Erik ten Hag at Manchester United.\nVan Persie — who also played for Arsenal, Manchester United and Fenerbahce, as well as the Netherlands national team — has been part of the succession planning at Feyenoord for years.\nThe 41-year-old managed their under-16 and under-18 sides, as well as working as an assistant to Dick Advocaat, before leaving last summer to take over at Heerenveen, now ninth in the table despite an embarrassing 9-1 defeat to AZ in his fourth match in charge.\n“We have invested a lot of time in Robin’s development,” Te Kloese said at Van Persie’s unveiling, where the new head coach said his achievements as a player counted for nothing.\nWade tells The Athletic he was excited to see how Van Persie fared in the hotseat. “He was well prepared for everything. He would turn up to meetings with the biggest notepad I’ve ever seen, full of printouts and notes. He was always very attentive, not your typical ex-superstar footballer.\nAdvertisement\n“He always wanted to be judged on his coaching merit. When you got him talking about football and tactics, he was always passionate, very smart. He’s an absolute pro.”\nStill grappling with an injury crisis, Van Persie presided over a 0-0 draw at home to NEC Nijmegen in his first match in charge, which has left them 11 points off second-place PSV and automatic Champions League qualification, albeit with a game in hand. Then came that 2-0 home defeat against Inter.\nThey return to the San Siro on Tuesday, hoping for a miracle after a tough time since Slot’s exit.\nGO DEEPER\n'It still hurts us every day': Slot's 'lost' title at AZ\n(Top photo: Van Persie by Koen van Weel/ANP/AFP via Getty Images)",
