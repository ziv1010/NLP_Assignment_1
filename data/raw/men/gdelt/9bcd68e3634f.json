Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nBut United rejected the chance to offload Zirzkee while setting out their terms for Hojlund’s departure from the Theatre of Dreams.\nLike Zirzkee, Hojlund also endured a miserable season in front of goal, scoring four Premier League goals.\nThe Denmark international recently dismissed speculation he could leave Manchester United this summer but Gazzetta dello Sport say he is privately keen to join Inter Milan.\nRasmus Hojlund breaks silence on Man Utd transfer rumours\n‘I have a contract until 2030, so I expect to play for Manchester United. I’m looking forward to going on a summer vacation, and then I’m fully dedicated to the project that’s underway.\n‘As I’ve told you before, I try to stay away from all that, because it’s both for better and for worse these days.\n‘I know I can’t get much out of reading things. I know what the facts are, and that is that I have a contract with Manchester United until 2030.\n‘I expect to play there, so I’m just getting ready for some summer vacation and then hopefully a good pre-season.’\nSpeaking to Danish news outlet Ekstra Bladet\nHojlund’s representatives have held positive talks with the Champions League finalists and United have indicated he is free to leave on a permanent transfer.\nManchester United are not interested in loaning Hojlund out next season unless there is an obligation to make the move permanent in 12 months’ time for around €45 (£38m).\nEx-Premier League striker Chris Sutton believes United should ‘get rid’ of both Hojlund and Zirkzee, claiming neither are at the level needed to play for the Red Devils.\n‘United want to get to the top of the Premier League and into the Champions League,’ he said. ‘Is Zirkzee a player who gets you there? Not for me, he isn’t.\n‘I don’t think Hojlund has that striker quality required for the Premier League either. He’s a hard worker but not the source of goals they desperately need.’\nHojlund and Zirkzee’s struggles have led Manchester United to target a new No. 9 this summer.\n‘Zirkzee can become superstar at Man Utd’\nRuben Amorim was keen to welcome Liam Delap to Manchester before Chelsea won the transfer race and is interested in his former Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres.\nBut perhaps there is a more to come from Zirzkee, who can develop into a ‘superstar’ for the Premier League giants, according to Old Trafford hero Lee Sharpe.\nMore Trending\n‘I like Zirkzee – he was unfortunate to get injured when he did, but he’s a real baller and I think he can be a superstar for Manchester United if he can get games under his belt,’ Sharpe told Metro via Coin Poker.\n‘He needs a regular run. I don’t think he’s had a 10-game stint where he has actually played week in, week out.\n‘There were reports that he wasn’t quite fit when he signed, so it took him a bit of time to get up to speed.\n‘I think he was just finding his feet when he got injured but I think he’s going to prove a real key player next season.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Tottenham urged to sign Arsenal and Chelsea transfer target to replace Son Heung-min\nMORE: Viktor Gyokeres rejects £55m transfer after Man Utd, Arsenal and Chelsea talks\nMORE: Man City target forgotten Chelsea star to replace cult hero Scott Carson",
