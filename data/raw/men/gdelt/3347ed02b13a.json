  "body_text": "Legendary Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel has jumped to the defence of under-fire star Andre Onana, calling out the relentless barrage of criticism that has been directed his way.\nOnana has endured another difficult season, making a series of extremely costly errors between the sticks.\nHe has been in the firing line since his mistake-strewn performance in the first leg of United’s Europa League quarter-final tie against Lyon. Ruben Amorim dropped Onana for the subsequent game against Newcastle at St James’ Park for Altay Bayindir.\nThe Turkey international didn’t fare much better as the Red Devils slipped to a humbling 4-1 loss. Bayindir’s horror display paved the way for Onana to return to the XI and he looks set to start again this Sunday against Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium.\nSpeculation over Onana’s future at Old Trafford remains rife, amidst links to the likes of Diogo Costa (Porto), Bart Verbruggen (Brighton), Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton), Kaua Santos (Eintracht Frankfurt), Mike Maignan (AC Milan), Carl Rushworth (Brighton), Lucas Chevalier (Lille) and Senne Lammens (Royal Antwerp), just to mention a few names.\nSpeaking on talkSPORT, Schmeichel expressed some sympathy for the Cameroonian.\nSchmeichel said, “Just look where Manchester United are in the Premier League. The players are not having the greatest time.”\n“I try to explain this to people, why is it different playing for Manchester United as opposed to any other club?”\n“I showed this to my wife the other day. We have a broadsheet newspaper in Denmark that doesn’t have a sports section, but they still carry Manchester United’s results and not just a little line but in an article.”\n“If you’re any other club, or most other clubs, you don’t have that. You don’t have all the fringe, non-sporting papers reporting on your games and that is where the pressure is.”\n“Every single thing you do in a game of football will be reported everywhere in the world. For instance, as a goalkeeper, if you make a mistake, everybody in the world will be talking about that mistake. If you make a mistake for so many other clubs in the Premier League, they might just be in the newspaper the next day. But you’re not going to talk about it tomorrow or the day after.”\n“That is where the mental toughness of being a Manchester United player comes in. It’s been a difficult year, it’s been a difficult year for everyone, so singling out anyone, I think that would be very, very wrong.”\nSchmeichel emphasised that United need to win the Europa League not only to restore some lost pride but also to qualify for the Champions League and give themselves the best possible chance in the upcoming summer transfer window.\n“There is still this chance that Manchester United could win the Europa League,’ the five-time Premier League winner added. If they win the Europa League, it’s a completely different situation the summer transfer window coming up.”\n“It will give an opportunity to sign better players because the club will be more attractive because of the Champions League. And, of course, they would be in a better financial situation so they can sign more players. This is where we’re pinning our hopes so let’s hope that happens and let’s hope the club moves in a more positive direction.”\nAsked about Marcus Rashford and where his future may lie, the five-time Premier League winner refused to comment, only saying everyone will have to wait and see how the situation develops.\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
