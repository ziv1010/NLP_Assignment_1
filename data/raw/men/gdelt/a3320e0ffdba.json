Jadon Sancho is on loan at Aston Villa, where Marcus Rashford ended last season. Meanwhile, the England forward is now at Barcelona. Antony was sold to Real Betis, Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea. Of Manchester United’s so-called ‘bomb squad’ only Tyrell Malacia remained.\nA post shared by MR14 (@marcusrashford)\nA photo posted by on\nIt’s apparent there’s no way back for Sancho but Carrick is reportedly eager to welcome Rashford back into the fold should he be installed as permanent head coach in the summer.\n“If Michael Carrick is retained as United’s head coach beyond this season, then he would like his former team-mate back,” reports Jason Burt in The Telegraph.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\n“It is hard to see that happening… Such was United’s desire to ship Rashford out, and presumably off their wage bill, that they did not insert a clause in the deal allowing them to recall him in the January window.”\nBurt writes that both Rashford and Barcelona are ‘happy’ and that Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick is ‘keen to activate’ the £26 million option to buy at the end of the season.\nWith nine goals and 12 assists already this season, Rashford, who is ranked at no.10 in FourFourTwo's list of the best left-wingers in the world right now, looks every inch a player getting back on track. At 28, he’s got years of football still ahead of him and plenty left to offer at the top level.\nGet VIP Manchester United tickets HERE with Seat Unique!\nManchester United's hospitality offers comfortable, padded seating in the North West Quadrant. The package includes a concourse meal deal (hot food, drink, and snack) and the official matchday programme. Guests also receive a 10 per cent Megastore discount and non-matchday Museum entry, providing a great value, family-friendly match experience for home fans.\n“[Rotation] is a situation Rashford accepts,” reports Burt. “The excellent man management of Flick, often seen with his arm around him offering encouragement, is a big factor in that.”\nSo positive is Rashford’s experience in Spain that it’s hard to see why he’d be drawn to home but some people, some players, just are.\nIt would be understandable if Rashford felt he had unfinished business at Old Trafford, given some of Amorim’s comments about him and the way he eventually left the club.\nCarrick and Manchester United face the head coach’s former club, Tottenham Hotspur, in the Premier League’s Saturday lunchtime kick-off this weekend.\nChris is a Warwickshire-based freelance writer, Editor-in-Chief of AVillaFan.com, author of the High Protein Beef Paste football newsletter and owner of Aston Villa Review.
