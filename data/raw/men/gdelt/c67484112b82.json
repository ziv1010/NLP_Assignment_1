  "body_text": "Real Madrid’s quest for another Champions League title faces a potential setback with the news that key midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni is likely to miss the final against Borussia Dortmund due to a foot injury, according to a report in MARCA.\nTchouameni all but ruled out for Champions League Final -report\nAccording to MARCA.\nTchouameni sustained a stress fracture during the second leg of the semi-final against Bayern Munich. While manager Carlo Ancelotti had hoped for the Frenchman’s recovery in time for the final on June 1st, the report suggests this is highly unlikely.\nTchouameni’s absence would be a significant blow to Real Madrid’s midfield, forcing them to adjust their tactics. The mantle of defensive midfield duties would likely fall on Eduardo Camavinga, a talented young player but lacking the experience of Tchouameni for such a crucial match. Ancelotti would undoubtedly prefer to have both players available, with Camavinga offering valuable depth on the bench.\nThe Champions League final now presents a test of Real Madrid’s midfield depth. Can Camavinga step up in Tchouameni’s absence, or will Borussia Dortmund exploit the potential vulnerability in the center of the park? Ancelotti faces a difficult decision, as his midfield options will be stretched thin on the biggest stage in European club football.",
