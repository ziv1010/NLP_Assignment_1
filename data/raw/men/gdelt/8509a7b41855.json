It’s in the name!\nDaily Thread: 13th February 2024\nTuesday Edition of the Daily Merengue\nShoutout to the mods who do a fantastic job, Felipejack, Kung_Fu_Zizou, Juninho, NeRObutBlanco and yours truly, Valyrian Steel.\nGameday!!! Return of the Champions League.\nAfter 2 months the Champions League returns with Los Blancos in action tonight against Leipzig at the RB Arena. Brahim Diaz is expected to slot in for Jude Bellingham but Carlo could have other tricks up his sleeve as well. Nacho returns but it’s unclear if he will feature.\nCarlo talks to the press.\nThe coach spoke to the press and had some interesting comments as usual.\nKroos and the retirement question.\nIf you want an insight into elite mentality here is a Toni Kroos quote from his press conference. “I’m happy with my performances, but the real season starts in March or April.”",
