The 24-year-old, whose Reading contract is up at the end of June, decided not to sign a permanent deal with Town when he joined the club last summer in order to keep his options open.\nRosenior, who says he is interesting an overseas side which has qualified for the Champions League, says he’d ideally like to find a top flight club: “The Premier League is where I want to be and I think I’m good enough having played there before.\n“There is interest, but if not it looks as though there will be good opportunities for me abroad.\n“I came to Ipswich to get them into the top flight, but as it didn’t happen there is no certainty I would have signed a new contract if offered one.”\nRosenior felt he did well in his 28 starts and three sub appearances while with Town, scoring one goal, with the exception of the Watford match: “Before the game at Vicarage Road I was being sick and I can’t think of another off day that I had.”\nThe former England U21 international, who said he enjoyed his time in Suffolk, is confident that manager Roy Keane will get things right at Portman Road: “After the first three months we showed play-off form so something was being done right — and with the players the manager has got it will only get better.”\nPhoto: Action Images via Reuters\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\nHe thinks he is better than he is and personally now i'm glad he wasnt offered a contract. you want people in your team to play well all the time and give their all no matter the circumstances. Imagine if we had got relegated cos someone like him stopped playing!\nNo wonder reading fans didnt like him!! (he was awsome away against)\nyou people clearly werent at the watford game or the derby game???\nI came to Ipswich to get them into the top flight, but as it didn't happen there is no certainty I would have signed a new contract if offered one.”\nAs Ipswich didnt get into the top flight there was no certainty abuot signing!!!!\nJust seems that after the terrible start we had, he knew he wouldnt be going up with town so why the need to try?\nSame with Murphy i think, when he joined i think he actually thought we might get someone near the play offs, once that dream was over, he stopped trying.\n'The Premier League is where I want to be and I think I'm good enough having played there before'\nThat doesnt mean sh*t\nfalling foul of the law why??\nI don't buy the theory that he stopped trying coz we couldn't go up. That's just nonsense. He may well have stopped trying so hard in training due to being unhappy at being dropped. Keane has a big thing about players that train well. But in matches he never looked like he wasn't trying to me.\nI think it's a combintion of poor man-management on keane's part and big-headedness on Rosenior's.\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
