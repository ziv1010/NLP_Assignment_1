Mattia Zaccagni scored in the eighth minute of stoppage time for Italy to draw 1-1 and advance to the knockout stage.\nCroatia need an improbable series of other results going their way to remain at Euro 2024.\nModric, who is 38 years and 289 days old, claimed the opening goal in the 55th minute, within a minute of having a penalty saved by Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.\nThe previous record was held by Ivica Vastic, who was 38 years, 257 days old when he scored for Austria against Poland at Euro 2008.\nModric received standing ovations from fans when he went off in the 80th minute, and he was applauded again when he showed up for the post-game news conference.\nOne Italian journalist started by telling Modric he was one of the most magnificent players he had ever seen. He said he had no question to ask, just a request for him never to retire from playing.\nModric seemed genuinely moved by the kind words.\n\"I'd also like to keep playing forever, but there probably will come a time when I'll have to hang up my boots,\" he replied.\n\"I'll keep playing. I'll continue, so I'm not sure when, we'll see.\"\nModric this month extended his contract by another year at Real Madrid, where he has amassed an impressive haul of trophies since joining from Tottenham in 2012, including another Champions League and Spanish league title last season.\nHe has played 178 games for Croatia since making his debut at age 20 in 2006.\nThe 2018 Ballon d'Or winner is playing in his fifth European Championship. His goal against Italy took his tally to four goals in 16 games at the tournament.\nBut Modric has enjoyed greater success with the national team at the World Cup, leading Croatia to the final in 2018, and third place in 2022.\nThe draw against Italy, and the manner in which it came with the last kick of the game, means Croatia are almost certain to be eliminated.\n\"It was very stressful. We kept fighting like lions right to the end, but football is cruel,\" Modric said.\n\"That's part and parcel of football. Sometimes it brings a lot of happiness, but sometimes it makes you very sad as well.\n\"Losing like this is very difficult. It's hard to find words to describe how my teammates and probably the fans feel as well. Of course, we need to bounce back.\"\nModric, who is the team captain, took comfort from the performance.\n\"We gave everything for Croatia, and this is how Croatia presents itself, regardless of the cruelty of this result. We deserved more, but it's football,\" he said.\n\"We can be proud of how we represented Croatia.\"\nAustralian Associated Press",
