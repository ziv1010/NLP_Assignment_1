  "body_text": "Bayern Munich send message with Bundesliga at crossroads\nAugust 23, 2025Bayern Munich opened the new Bundesliga season in style while the chasing pack all faltered. But a new broadcast rights deal with content creators threatens to pit the country's fan culture against a new type of fan.\n\"We wanted to send a statement from the first game at home and that's what we did today,\" said Harry Kane, who scored a hat trick as Bayern Munich hammered RB Leipzig 6-0 on the first day of the 2025-26 Bundesliga season. Given that Bayern were last season's champions and Kane was top scorer, the message rang out loud and clear across Germany on Friday.\nCome Saturday, the chasing pack had the chance to show they have what it takes to stop the Bavarian club from winning a 14th title out of the last 15. Of the three clubs that bookmakers expect to join Bayern in the top four, Bayer Leverkusen, the only club to break Bayern's streak with an unprecedented unbeaten campaign in 2023-24, lost at home to Hoffenheim. Borussia Dortmund, the team who won it before the streak started, led 3-1 after 85 minutes only to fall to a draw against St. Pauli. The final side were RB Leipzig themselves.\n\"We're definitely making it harder than we need to,\" Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel said. \"It‘s certainly not what we imagined.\"\nThe Bundesliga's lack of competition at the top has long been a criticism of Germany's top flight. It has also hindered it on a broader stage, both in sporting and commercial terms. The last German side other than Bayern to win the Champions League was Dortmund 28 years ago. Since then, England's Premier League and Spain's La Liga have secured huge foreign TV rights deals that have allowed top sides from those countries to spend big on players that German sides outside of Bayern could not afford. Consequently, English or Spanish sides have won 10 of the last 12 Champions League titles.\nContent creators now part of the Bundesliga\nThe DFL, which operates the Bundesliga, attempted to negotiate a €1 billion ($1.17 billion) investment deal with a private equity partner last year, only for fan protests to win out and the deal to be pulled. The main nature of the fans' objection to the deal, which would have seen the investor own a stake in the league, was the overcommercialization of football, something rejected much more vehemently in Germany than any other top European league.\nJust days ahead of the new season, the DFL announced a new strategy for the broadcast market in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Though deals with traditional broadcasters cover most of the matches, it was the decision to award streaming rights to two YouTube channels, including That's Football, run by Mark Goldbridge, who made his name hosting \"watchalongs\" (where fans watch a content creator watching a match) on a Manchester United YouTube channel. Those watchalongs will now feature live footage for 10 games of the Bundesliga season.\n\"Our approach is as diverse as our supporters,\" Peer Naubert, chief executive officer of Bundesliga International, said earlier this week. According to the DFL, this is the \"first time ever a top league will grant live rights for an extensive package of matches to content creators in Europe.\"\nThe theory goes that younger fans consume the sport in nontraditional ways. Rather than watching a match live at the stadium or on TV, they use watchalongs, social media clips, video games or interact with their favorite players on social media.\nBundesliga courts a new global generation\nIt is a bold move from the DFL. Essentially, the league is gambling that pioneering such an approach will help steal a march on the other top European leagues, particularly the Premier League, in an attempt to somewhat redress the balance.\nIt's unlikely that this move will close a gap in foreign TV rights deals between the leagues, which stood at nearly €3 billion last season, but it might, the DFL hopes, win over a new generation of global fans who consume football in a different way.\nThe clash of cultures with the traditional matchgoing fan is clear. Germany's fan culture, partly thanks to the 50+1 rule, which enshrines majority member-ownership of clubs, is stronger than in England, Spain, Italy or France — which, along with the Bundesliga, are widely considered Europe's top five leagues. The rule means that clubs are much more accountable to their fans in terms of sponsorship deals, ticket prices or the matchday experience. Even Bayern have recently climbed down in their sponsorship deal with Rwanda after fan pressure.\nAt the moment, the rights in the United Kingdom and Ireland are not as much of a concern to those fans as last year's proposed deal, which would have seen the investor take 8% of all league revenues, including broadcast, over 20 years.\nThough top-level football has moved away from prioritzing the local fan in the stadium to courting international fans on social media, the hope of many of the former group is that the game itself is a fundamental part of the appeal. And for the Bundesliga, a lack of competitiveness at the top will undermine the product, regardless of how it's packaged.\nThat said, the aborted breakaway European Super League — proposed in 2021 and notably rejected by Bayern and Dortmund but embraced initially by others — was based on the appeal of selected top clubs playing each other over and over again, as is the newly revamped Club World Cup.\nIt should be far too early to draw any conclusions about Bayern's retaining the title. But perhaps, outside of Munich and Germany, it's not that important anyway.\nEdited by: Karl Sexton",
