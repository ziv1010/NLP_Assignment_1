  "body_text": "Real Madrid scored an 83rd minute equaliser to deny Bayern Munich a win as both European giants played out a 2-2 draw in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League (UCL) tie at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday.\nVinicius Jr. had given the visitors the lead and equalised late on after the duo of Leroy Sane and Harry Kane had turned the game around for Bayern.\nThe two clubs take first and second positions respectively in the highest UCL semi-final appearances, and their storied attachment to the competition was on display with camaraderie in the stands and entertaining football on the pitch.\nBayern Munich did not have much luck in front of goal in the early exchanges with several chances created but not taken, allowing Real Madrid settled into the encounter and take the lead through Vinicius Jr. on 23 minutes.\nAdvertisement\nThe Brazilian winger latched on to Toni Kroos’ defence-splitting through ball before slotting beyond Manuel Neuer for his sixth UCL goal of the season.\nBayern would turn the game around early in the second half, with Sane drilling into the net at Andriy Lunin’s near post on 53 minutes before Kane scored from a penalty kick four minutes later.\nA flurry of substitutions saw Real Madrid steady the ship and they went on to equalise seven minutes to the end from the penalty spot following a foul on Rodrygo.\nAdvertisement\nVinicius slotted in to complete his brace, putting the two-legged semi-final tie on a knife edge.\nBayern Munich, following the draw, are winless in their eight games against Real Madrid, while Real Madrid remain unbeaten in this season’s UCL competition going into the second leg in Spain next week.",
