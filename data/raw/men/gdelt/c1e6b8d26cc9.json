His passion and emotion is infectious.\nBruno, Bruno, Bruno 😍 pic.twitter.com/13HcBtnDqFOctober 25, 2025\nClubs like Newcastle are a life support system for their communities, not merely weekend entertainment. What happens on the pitch dictates the mood of the entire region, and few players have understood that environment, and the mission they must undertake, quite like Guimaraes.\nThe love between player and supporters is strong and mutual.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nIt helps, of course, when he steps up to score crucial goals in big moments when Newcastle need him most.\nThat is exactly what he did against Fulham on Saturday, netting a last-minute winner as frustration and angst began to swirl on Tyneside.\nAfter stoppage time losses to Arsenal and Liverpool, the boot was firmly placed on the other foot.\n“We were not at our best, but even with the difficulties we found a way to win the game,” Guimaraes admitted after the game.\n“It was a special moment to score at the end after being punished against Liverpool and Arsenal. Today we found a way.\n“I’m very pleased for everyone; it is not easy to play Tuesday and today again, we have to keep going but I’m very happy.”\nNewcastle were forced into tactical evolution this summer when Nick Woltemade replaced Alexander Isak up front, and that has caused some teething issues in attack.\nOne of the defining issues of their inconsistent Premier League form has been a lack of goals from across the pitch, but the Brazilian has now scored five goals in his last 10 home league as a result of a new role.\n“The gaffer has asked me to be more in the box and I was there in the right moment to score,” he added.\n“When I missed the header I had it in my mind that if I had another chance I will not miss. It was a beautiful moment, scoring in front of the Gallowgate at the end of the game, my whole family is here. I will have a great night.\n“This team will fight until the end and not give up. It was a great shift. I have to be more in the box, today was proof I can impact the team well in that way, I am pleased to score. I was there to score an important goal.”\nPerformances, particularly domestically, have left a lot to be desired at times this season. As Guimaraes said, it wasn’t vintage Newcastle, but Howe was pleased overall.\n“I don’t think the performance was bad,” he said. “Definitely the result we were looking for. Can’t underestimate the challenge of Tuesday to Saturday. I thought the strongest part of our performance was the last 20-25 minutes.\n“We’re still in the Carabao Cup, we’re OK in the Champions League, and in the Premier League I’d like to think we’ll progress as the season goes on. The best is yet to come.“\nSandro Tonali’s introduction coincided with a stronger showing from the home side; until then, Newcastle were rather passive in the middle and sloppy in possession. Part of that is reflected in Guimaraes’ more advanced positioning; he is a complete midfielder, able to turn his hand to whatever is asked of him.\nPerhaps his biggest pitfall is that he can’t be in two places at once, but it should be remembered that when Tonali arrived, there were concerns they were too similar to play together; now it is their contrast which makes them arguably English football’s best partnership, notwithstanding Joelinton’s immense contributions.\nBut Guimaraes is so often the man for the big moment at Newcastle; when needed, he is there.\nThe captain, the man who sets the standard, plays on the edge, like a fan, for the fans. Such is the level of his consistency and, crucially, availability, it is easy to take him for granted.\nHe is loved more than most by the fans, having bought into the culture. In January, it will be four years since he signed; Newcastle have been transformed since.\nNot only has Bruno Guimaraes seen that happen, he’s helped make it happen, too.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name.",
