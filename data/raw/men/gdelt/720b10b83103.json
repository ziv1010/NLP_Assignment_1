  "body_text": "The world according to Jim:\n• Your reminder that NFL training camps are opening comes with this alert: Running backs throughout the league are unhappy.\nThis week’s biggest news – that Saquon Barkley, Josh Jacobs and Tony Pollard were all franchise-tagged and none signed long-term extensions with the New York Giants, Las Vegas Raiders or Dallas Cowboys by the Monday deadline – seemed to confirm the lack of value placed on the position. And the Chargers’ Austin Ekeler had some pointed comments on Rich Eisen’s radio show last week, and while they might have raised some eyebrows they probably shouldn’t have. …\n• Ekeler, remember, went from undrafted free agent to valuable weapon with the Chargers. But he requested a trade before the Chargers slightly sweetened the last year of his contract. And like others at his position, he’s dealing with the league-wide mindset that running backs have short shelf lives because of wear and tear, can be (relatively) easily replaced and thus shouldn’t get the sort of long-term investment that other positions might demand. …\n• Maybe we should call it the Todd Gurley Rule, after the former Rams star went from All-Pro to Can’t Stay On The Field. Gurley signed a four-year, $57.5 million extension after his Offensive Player of the Year season in 2017, developed a knee problem in 2018, was released in March of 2020, played one year with the Atlanta Falcons and is now out of football. …\n• Anyway, here’s Ekeler from his radio interview with Eisen:\n“We’re in the middle of a point where a bunch of money is getting flooded into other positions. … Wait a minute: You’re telling me the No. 3 receiver is going to make more than me, and I’m the starter? I get more carries; I touch the ball more. I have more of an impact. It causes us to question (the situation), right? We’re going to fight for that. Hey, I’m bringing more value to the team than this person. I think I should be compensated for that.” …\n“Let’s compare, let’s see what the real value-add to a team is.” — the #BoltUp RB talked with us about the current state of the #NFL running back market: pic.twitter.com/ZiXcibOiDJ\n— Rich Eisen Show (@RichEisenShow) July 13, 2023\n• That argument is noble, and it’s logical. But I don’t see things changing …\n• So the launch of Lionel Messi’s MLS tenure takes place in the contrived Leagues Cup competition Friday night, instead of a regular league match for Inter Miami. And maybe Messi had the right idea by taking a few weeks off and coming over to this continent at midseason, because the increasing burden of the schedule threatens to run the league’s players into the ground. …\n• Consider: LAFC’s 34-game MLS regular season began March 4 and runs through Oct. 21. But between league matches, the CONCACAF Champions League, the U.S. Open Cup (wisely, they went out in their second match after playing mostly reserves against the Galaxy in the Round of 16 clash) and now the month-long Leagues Cup, they could play a maximum 56 games if they make it to the championship game on Dec. 9. …\n• And it could be worse. They get to avoid the group stage of the Leagues Cup as defending MLS champions. …\n• The thinking behind this tournament isn’t hard to deduce. It’s a gimmick for the benefit of MLS’ streaming partner, Apple TV+, which paid $2.5 billion over 10 years for exclusive telecasts. But here’s a better idea: Rather than a contrived tournament, just institute limited interleague play between MLS and Liga MX and count the games in the standings. Problem solved. …\n• But not all gimmicks are bad. For instance, if Steph Curry and Sabrina Ionescu were to have a 3-point shooting contest – and Sabrina laid down that marker after her WNBA All-Star marksmanship demonstration last weekend – I’d definitely watch. …\n• Then again, how’s Sabrina’s golf game? …\nSteph Curry hole in one.

If you haven’t had a chance to read the Northwestern Daily’s investigative report on hazing in the school’s football program, it is in the very best journalistic tradition of comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable. It led to follow-up stories on allegations of racism in the program and allegations of abuse in other sports on campus. …\n• Nicole Markus, Alyce Brown, Cole Reynolds and Divya Bhardwaj were the reporters on those stories. They did all of us in the journalism profession proud, and if college journalists don’t qualify for Pulitzer Prizes, they should at least get some special recognition from the committee. …\n• Is Carlos Alcaraz the savior of tennis? The sport is at its best when there are true rivalries, and the 20-year-old Spaniard’s victory over Novak Djokovic in Sunday’s Wimbledon final indicated that it’s not lonely at the top in the men’s game. …\n• The James Harden-to-the-Clippers drumbeat is getting louder, and I still don’t get the assumption that putting Harden together with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George means instant championship contention. I especially don’t understand the concept that a guy who has asked out from his last three teams is going to fit seamlessly into this one. …\n• In the meantime, Harden fired up the speculation machine on Thursday with this Instagram post: “Been comfortable for so long. It’s time to get uncomfortable.”\nJames Harden on Instagram #Sixers pic.twitter.com/FEWLRlWyYj\n— Erin Grugan (@eringrugan) July 20, 2023\nNBA drama. It’s fantastic!\njalexander@scng.com",
