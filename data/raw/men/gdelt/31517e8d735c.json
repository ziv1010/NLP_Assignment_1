I know it’s going to happen, we accept it and focus on Ipswich Town.\n“After West Ham, international break, Brentford, Arsenal, Champions League and so on. I can give you all the calendar – it’s in my mind.”\nCity’s alleged breaches relate to rules requiring the reporting of accurate financial information, the submission of details of manager and player pay information within the relevant contracts, a club’s responsibility as a Premier League member to adhere to UEFA’s financial regulations and to the league’s own profitability and sustainability regulations.\nThe club are also alleged to have breached rules requiring them to co-operate and assist with the Premier League’s investigation into those breaches, which the league said began in December 2018.\nPremier League chief executive Richard Masters last week said he accepts the legal cases facing City and others create “uncertainty and frustration” but said that “there is no happy alternative to enforcing the rules”.\nCity opened the new Premier League season with a 2-0 win at Chelsea and welcome promoted Ipswich in their first home game of the campaign on Saturday afternoon.\nGuardiola’s side have this month also beaten Manchester United on penalties to win the Community Shield.",
