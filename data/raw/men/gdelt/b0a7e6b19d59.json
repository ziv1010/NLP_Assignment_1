It was apt, given Noni Madueke spent the second half running the show in this friendly at the King Power Stadium in Leicester, scoring once, assisting twice and being named player of the match — after the Chelsea forward only came on as a 66th-minute substitute.\nAdvertisement\nBoth sides started in a 4-2-3-1, though England played Harvey Elliott, Morgan Gibbs-White and Emile Smith Rowe as fluid No 10s in a narrow three behind Cameron Archer, who was stepping in for the injured Folarin Balogun.\nAll three roamed in a goalless first half, at times on the same side of the pitch simultaneously, looking to form triangles to break down the stubborn 4-4-2 mid-block adopted by France when they didn’t have the ball.\n“For the first 35 minutes, I didn’t think we were very good,” said England head coach Lee Carsley, who is preparing his team for the Under-21 European Championship in Romania and Georgia this summer.\nHe felt his side made “basic errors” and “handed over momentum to them too many times”. Full-backs Djed Spence and Max Aarons pushed on and central midfielders Oliver Skipp and Angel Gomes rotated into wide spaces, leaving England light in the middle and susceptible to counter-attacks.\nFrance outshot England 8-3 in the first half (it was 4-1 for shots on target).\nCarsley felt the “most pleasing thing” about that period of the game was that they “showed a real good spirit, making some really good blocks, tracking runners, doing all the basics that you need to do”. He accepted “you’re not always going to be perfect, and it’s important that you don’t concede a goal”.\nKeeping goals out has been a problem at this age group, with England enduring more than a decade of failures at the U21 Euros.\nSince the 2009 final, when they were embarrassed 4-0 by Germany and after which the academy-revolutionising Elite Player Performance Plan was conceived, six different squads under three different coaches (Stuart Pearce, Gareth Southgate and Aidy Boothroyd) have kept just four clean sheets in 19 games at the Euros games.\nEngland have exited at the group stage in five of those six tournaments (the top two from each group advance, with the 2021 version expanding from eight teams to 16). They have won just four matches, drawn four and lost 12, and been outscored 28-20. Even in 2017, when they did reach the semi-finals, the under-21s were the only professional phase age group not to reach a final or win a trophy in the calendar year.\nEngland youth 2017-18:\nEuro U17 2017 🥈\nEuro U17 2018 SF\nEuro U19 2017 🏆\nEuro U19 2018 GS\nWorld Cup U17 🏆\nWorld Cup U20 🏆\nEuro U21 SF10 players from these teams are at Euro 2020: Pickford, Henderson, Chilwell, James, Mount, Foden, Grealish, Sancho, Saka & Calvert-Lewin. 🏴 pic.twitter.com/ewa3zgoqVS\n— Football Talent Scout – Jacek Kulig (@FTalentScout) June 10, 2021\nAt the last Euros, they went out on goal difference as a result of a 91st-minute goal conceded to Croatia in winning the final group game 2-1 — England lost their first two group matches without scoring, after which then-head coach Boothroyd claimed the job was “utterly impossible”.\nAdvertisement\nWinning the contest in both boxes and staying in Saturday’s game is even more impressive, given the quality of the opposition.\nTheir squad has multiple Champions League and Europa League players. France Under-21s topped their Euros qualifying group with eight wins and two draws in the 10 games, scoring 31 goals and conceding only five. They had not conceded four times since a meeting with Spain in 2019 and came to Leicester unbeaten for almost two years and across 14 games.\nEngland put away all four of their second-half big chances, taking six shots (five on target), with three goals in the final 15 minutes. Goalkeeper James Trafford made five saves but consistently played short and England showed maturity to play with their “DNA”, while adapting to contain France’s threats in transition.\n⚽️ 50': Smith Rowe\n⚽️ 77': Madueke\n⚽️ 79': Jones\n⚽️ 86': RamseyEngland turn on the style in the second half to dismantle a strong France side 🏴 pic.twitter.com/x730Tzbpjg\n— The Athletic | Football (@TheAthleticFC) March 25, 2023\nThe first two goals had the identity of modern England sides.\nSmith Rowe’s opener, a header from Gibbs-White’s half-space cross, originated from a high turnover that forced French central defender Benoit Badiashile to misplace a pass.\nThe #YoungLions take the lead.\nEmile Smith Rowe heads in after a fantastic cross from Morgan Gibbs-White.\n🏴 England 1-0 France 🇫🇷#BBCFootball pic.twitter.com/Qxs5XW7J5n\n— BBC Sport (@BBCSport) March 25, 2023\nA combined 13 substitutes (seven by England) were made in the 27 minutes between the first and second goals, for which four of Carsley’s replacements combined on the edge of the French penalty area. Eventual scorer Madueke received the midfield-splitting pass, setting it to Curtis Jones, who returned it to him after Jacob Ramsey’s pass was deflected.\nAdvertisement\nThe position was similar to Smith Rowe’s opener, but the goal was entirely different. That kind of attacking variety is often important in a tournament.\nThe #YoungLions double their lead!\nChelsea's Noni Madueke with a cool finish.\n🏴 England 2-0 France 🇫🇷#BBCFootball pic.twitter.com/jJiZ4tzi6R\n— BBC Sport (@BBCSport) March 25, 2023\nCarsley described Madueke as positionally “versatile”, capable of playing on either wing or as a No 9. “Excellent” was how he described the 20-year-old signed from Dutch heavyweights PSV in January, “really threatening the back line, then having that quality and that calmness” to provide an end product.\nThe head coach thinks Madueke’s style “will really suit the Premier League” because the former Crystal Palace and Tottenham Hotspur youngster is “exciting, he’s fast, he’s direct”, but noted “we have to remember with all those things, he’s still young. So he’s going to need time, need match minutes and a chance to keep working on his game”.\nGO DEEPER\nNoni Madueke: Quick, skilful, clever and Chelsea's perfect complement for Mudryk\nEngland’s third and fourth goals were more transitional, breaks from deep, but a testament to their shape, which forced France into errors.\nMadueke assisted both: for the third he initially ran in behind the defence, then repositioned to cross low for Jones to backheel a finish from inside the six-yard box. That was followed by an incisive combination with Ramsey, splitting the France defence between the right-back and centre-back, and the Aston Villa player scoring from an angle.\nThis finish from Curtis Jones 🤌\nFrance U21s two-year unbeaten run is about to come to an end thanks to the #YoungLions\n🏴 England 3-0 France 🇫🇷#BBCFootball pic.twitter.com/64WcFMA79K\n— BBC Sport (@BBCSport) March 25, 2023\nAnother brilliant goal for the #YoungLions!\nJacob Ramsey finishes after amazing build-up play from Noni Madueke.\n🏴 England 4-0 France 🇫🇷#BBCFootball pic.twitter.com/oVCCgznW9u\n— BBC Sport (@BBCSport) March 25, 2023\nSmith Rowe emphasised post-match that these performances count for nothing until the summer’s finals, but England seem to be moving past Boothroyd’s perspective from two years ago: “There’s a reason why we haven’t won this (the Under-21 Euros) for 37 years and why we haven’t progressed as much as we thought we would — because our primary aim is to get players through to Gareth (Southgate, England’s senior-team manager),” he said at the time.\nCarsley acknowledged they are “trying to create players to play in a team”, but developing and fast-tracking talent and winning tournaments do not have to be mutually exclusive.\nAdvertisement\nSince 2000, Netherlands and Italy are two-time Under-21 Euros winners, with the latter the current senior European champions. The Czech Republic (in 2002), who feature with Israel and holders Germany in England’s group at this year’s tournament, have won this event more recently than England (1984).\nSpain and Germany have each won the U21 Euros three times this century and both also have a senior World Cup in that time.\nAmong European nations, only Spain (average of 25.5 years) were younger than England (26.1) at the recent World Cup, with Southgate also having picked the second-youngest team with the second-fewest average caps at the previous year’s Euros.\nAs Euro 2020 was delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the next senior European Championship is just 15 months away, with the qualification competition having begun this week.\nMake the step up this summer and some of these under-21s could find themselves in Southgate’s squad in Germany next summer. Although they have a shot at silverware of their own first.\n(Top photo: Nick Potts/PA Images via Getty Images)",
