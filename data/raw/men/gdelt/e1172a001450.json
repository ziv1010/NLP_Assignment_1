I thought there were some really good performances and it would be unfair of me to single out an individual because it was a real group and team effort. We haven’t won again, but we’ve managed to stop the bleeding against a very good side.\n“You can only be proud as a coach of the players. In the adversity, to come into the stadium with what’s going on in terms of the results profile against a promotion-chasing team and to stick to the game plan in the manner they did, I’m so pleased for the group and so pleased for the football club.”\nHe added: “To a man today, they were superb, and that includes the lads who came into the game,\n“They kept following their instruction, backing each other up and I thought it was a really good performance, what you would call a proper team performance.\n“In the midst of that, I think you saw a few young boys turn into men tonight and that will go a long way to settling them into our football club and we have given them what they have come for, which is a foundation to build a fantastic career off.”\nPhoto: Action Images via Reuters\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nDespite the fact that we have seen for months that this approach has worked against us & cost us multiple points against supposed inferior sides, Rovers, on a 5 game losing streak, dealt with us fairly comfortably, as we had no solution to breaking them down. Buying million pound+ players to add to a squad already deemed the strongest in the league, has not helped us address the problem\nThe problem is the McK era has stalled because he doesn't know how to produce winning football in this League. As he said umpteen times in his post match interview, we have drawn too many games and that is why we are losing touch at the top and sliding down the table. He doesn't hide behind the fact that we haven't lost many, it is the fact that we can't win that is a stone around his neck. He knows it isn't working but he doesn't know how to solve it because he would have done so by now if he did. Teams have blips but this isn't one of those, it's a serious issue.\nEveryone (bar a few on here) have said it, he has one of the most expensive, talented squads in the division, something other coaches embarrassingly keep telling us, but he can't get a tune out of them now.\nHe doesn't know his best team, believes he can chop and change to suit who we are playing and tries to keep everyone happy with rotation. Tactically he is trying to play Champions League football in League 1 Poor teams all get behind the ball and good ones try to bully us, just like Sheff Wed on Saturday. And it is working for them.\nWe should be running away with this league and the fact we aren't means there's something seriously wrong.\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
