  "body_text": "Eddie’s Mags, honouring Easter as the time for the greatest comebacks\nIt felt like a long time coming this, a long, boring couple of weeks since that unspectacular FA Cup exit at the Etihad and an even longer four weeks since the last home game, when Wolves were so professionally and emphatically dispatched.\nSince then, targets have been realigned.\nNo FA Cup to save our season and diminishing hopes of any kind of European football have even been dismissed in some quarters as we persist in the shabby habit of giving too many goals away with a side accompaniment of constant injuries.\nToday could be key in how that challenge pans out. West Ham started off four points ahead of us having played a game more and occupying seventh place – currently the final European berth. That, of course, is open to change dependent on if any English sides win their respective European competitions, the impact that has on the potential fifth Champions League place and the identity of the FA Cup winners. I’m honestly lost off as to how far down the table things could stretch in the various scenarios, so best bet is to aim as high as possible, with the perfectly attainable seventh spot the bottom line as it stands.\nToday was critical towards that on two counts.\nFirst off, defeat would see distance open up between West Ham and ourselves, whereas a win would present a realistic imminent chance to overhaul them.\nSecondly, it is vital that the relatively benign fixture list ahead of us is exploited to full effect in the next seven weeks. Starting the ball rolling today would be a huge step to set the standard for that run in.\nSome positives emerged in the team selection as Livramento returned to the starting line up and (crucially, as it would turn out) Barnes came back to the bench, with Lascelles slotting back in for long-term absentee Botman.\nAnyone hoping for a positive start was to be – err, what’s the opposite of disappointed? It’s been a tricky few months… Anyway, people were roundly bristling with appointedment when United took the lead within five minutes. Gordon went steaming into the box and attempted to square the ball to Schar, only for it to rebound straight back to the marauding Scouser, who was impolitely impeded by an interjection from Coufal of such blood and thunder it could only be accompanied by a script of “HAVE IT!” or “OOMPH YA B…..D!” Gordon goes down fairly convincingly in these situations, to the extent you think he might actually be hurt. He wasn’t, he got up and Isak slapped the ball right into the corner in that way he makes penalties look so easy.\nOff to a good start and that used to mean Newcastle would control the game. Hopefully this would be nothing like Forest on Boxing Day, where Newcastle were gifted an early lead from an Isak penalty only to mess it right up by giving away three incredibly soft goals on the counter attack.\nReader, I almost don’t want to tell you what happened next, but I’ll assume you at least sort of know and (spoiler alert) at least this one ends happily. First though, we must plough through the hard part.\nI’m going to try not to be a whiny so and so given how things turned out, but I’ve absolutely had enough of Newcastle conceding this same goal that, on this occasion was converted by Antonio. Paqueta played a splendid ball out of midfield but he only had to aim roughly into the vast space between the back four and Dubravka, allowing his striker to kill Krafth with pace and finish comfortably as the goalie stayed rooted to the spot. I honestly think it’s a major failing that we haven’t adapted to prevent this same thing happening just about every week, with Dan Burn culpable at times but often scapegoated for what is a team failing. If Dubravka playing in goal is so incompatible with the style of the back four or the unchangeable system, then Karius should have had more game time to see if he could flex his game more suitably.\nThe goal that West Ham took the lead with was similar (natch) but even more annoying. A collision between Kudus and Schar on the halfway line saw our man go down clutching his head. With Schar still prostrate on the ground, West Ham were allowed to take the free kick quickly, releasing Bowen to square for Kudus to produce a finish that Dubravka needs to be doing better with. I was angry on many levels here, although this was assuaged slightly by the defiant stance of a gutsy ball boy, who Kudus expected to shift along so he could play about on the advertising hoardings for his little celebration. The kid was magnificently unmoving in the face of several West Ham players and I have no hesitation in awarding this young stoic the tag of todays Smithmeister General. You’ll go a long way in life with that approach son.\nThe misery hadn’t quite lifted before it trebled down early in the second half as counter attacking was once again made to look frighteningly simplistic for anyone visiting SJP. West Ham broke from a Newcastle corner and Kudus skipped away down the left (looking like he ran out of play at one point) before sending a long pass through for Bowen who had an unforgivable amount of space to run onto it. Dubravka was quick off his line to smother, except of course he wasn’t, Bowen had time to compose himself and pick his finish.\nI’ve probably said this before in West Ham write ups (what do you expect me to do, check?!) but it stings to see Bowen do so well, albeit I don’t begrudge the success to him or West Ham. Steve Bruce was a disaster as NUFC manager but one of the things he did get right was to pursue his former charge from Hull, who apparently would have signed for us given this past connection. The old regime had no appetite to fund such an endeavour (£20 million) and the rest is history. I suspect he’ll be the Hammers next big summer cash in and allow them to be PSR competitive while we face tricky decisions.\nAnyway, this was over wasn’t it? I feared a reversal of our own champagne football at the London Stadium last year when five goals did not flatter us, as Moyes seemed to have the tactics spot on to contain and exploit on the counter. If you’d told me at this point that Howe would win the managerial battle, I’d have called you bonkers, or probably just given you one of those looks (I’m good at them).\nThe use of both benches would turn this game on its head. First, Howe threw a triple on of Anderson, Hall and Almiron. I had a brief thought about how a similar interjection had breathed life into the game at City and wondered if there was still life in this last half hour. Hall had come on for Krafth, who had replaced the latest injury victim in Lascelles, subbed off early after going down heavily in a challenge with Antonio. Jamaal is a tough lad, so hopefully he runs that off, as to say centre half is becoming a problem is something of an understatement.\nMiggy, perhaps realising that we’d gone a good half hour without an injury, decided it was his turn, going down in a heap after less than ten minutes in the pitch. Harvey Barnes came off the bench in a substitution I can say confidently in advance will be documented in the match of the day highlights.\nThen it was Moyes’ turn. With 20 minutes to go, he obviously decided the game was won, so withdrew Antonio and replaced him with Kalvin Phillips, adding a bit of steel to midfield to tidy up and retain possession.\nBig mistake. Antonio as a lone front man had stretched the play, with our back four constantly having to worry about him. This withdrawal allowed play to move further up the pitch and suddenly things started to happen. First, a goalmouth scramble saw the ball fall to Isak, who had to snatch at his shot but fired wide in an echo of those misses at City. Worse was to come when Anderson picked out Longstaff with time and space to pick his shot, only for the kind of woeful miss that only happens when your confidence ain’t great. Still, we were on the front foot and the crowd had woken up and stayed right with the team throughout.\nThe third goalmouth scramble in quick succession was to be the pivotal one. Barnes fired a shot from a tight angle that Fabianski could only parry, with the ball half cleared as Longstaff dived in. Phillips attempted to launch a big one clear but Gordon nipped in front of him and took the full brunt of the big boot on his ankle. Isak couldn’t get onto the rebound and the chance went but then the screen went all purple. The VAR was having a look.\nThere’s been a lot said about this and it may well be that Anthony a Gordon has bought a penalty here. Gordon pelts in and gets his leg in front of of Phillips striking foot, barely dislodging the ball but drawing an obvious foul when the England mainstay boots him one instead of the old sphere. If you kick someone’s leg instead of the ball, it’s a foul. If you do a foul in your own box, it’s a penalty.\nThe referee’s consultation with the screen concluded this and if the decision was in any way influenced by a nagging guilt about the Schar incident at the end of the first half, then that’s fine by me. I suspect that the London press may pull a similar trick, as when we beat Arsenal, where Kai Havertz’ blatant red card was forgotten but the controversy over our goal was bored over to infinity. Shearer better not say it wasn’t a pen in an attempt to appear unbiased.\nAnyhow, course Isak slotted it into the corner, 2-3 and game on. I suggested to my mates that there was a chance West Ham might fall apart here, but given their abject failure to congratulate me on being smart / right when that was what happened, I might as well have not bothered, relying more heavily on the world of online reporting where I am more appreciated.\nIsak’s penalties are art but for me his finest contribution came five minutes later. I don’t like it when he drops too deep, in this instance picking the ball up from Schar in our own half, before turning and supplying a pass so sublime it deserved to find the feet of a finisher like Barnes. Perfectly weighted and angled, Barnes ran onto it and slotted it as cool as you like, 3-3 and the momentum was only going one way. Moyes’ midfield enforcement not really coming off as intended.\nThat feeling you get that a winner is coming is belief. I’m certain the team fed off that belief and Harvey Barnes was making this his day, going one better than when he rescued us from embarrassment against Luton. Phillips was involved again, as Barnes received the ball from Gordon and turned infield, brushing past Phillips in doing so before unleashing a hammer across goal and into the bottom corner. This kind of comeback is one of the best ways to win a game and the noise was a crescendo that had been building throughout the second half.\nWell done to everyone there for sticking with things, I think we were all felling a bit glum at the way it was panning out but stood firm. This included bouncing back in the face of some ill advised stick from the visiting fans, who noticed our malaise and started singing “sit down if you’re 3-1 down” which was rebooted with gusto as “stand up if you’re 4-3 up” at the end. Classic lads, classic. Considering their similar history to NUFC, the Hammers should have known better than to get chopsy with a half hour to go.\nDuring the goal celebrations, I’m sure the decision was for a meagre four minutes of injury time, but either this couldn’t be right, or the ref was being downright antagonistic as he allowed about ten. This was navigated despite some half attacks from the visitors, but there was still a nasty twist despite the victory. With Newcastle attempting to break, the play was pulled up and Gordon tapped the ball away as he was about to run onto it. It was hardly a petulant boot into the stands, literally a ten foot roll into feet of Fabianski. The ref had clearly decide that it was kicking the ball away and therefore a booking but you will never convince me that he knew Gordon had already been booked when he reached for the yellow. An absolute nonentity of a sending off as the red was sort of half-brandished and Gordon now misses a reunion with his old mates from Everton on Tuesday. It’s never all nice for us is it?\nThis was a win of some gusto and should be celebrated. However, we need to continue this momentum into that Everton match, and put together a run that salvages this season. On the evidence of today, we are still capable of the frailties that may jeopardise that ambition. Wins against the Ev and Fulham will almost certainly see us in position for a Euro spot ahead of a big match with Spurs, but it’s just not sustainable at a rate of three conceded per game.\nThe defence will once again change up as Burn and Schar will be the likely centre back pair, it’s the full back tbc. Tino didn’t look well but Trippier’s return must be imminent. Krafth never lets us down but Hall has looked excellent in his recent showings off the bench. The impetus he gave to the attack was as key to the turnaround as the arrival of Barnes and I believe he’s earned a starting spot next time out. Surely Howe can’t be that opposed to it. Left back with a bit of pace about him?\nYou have to further hope that the withdrawal of Willock was tactical and the knocks suffered by Lascelles and Almiron are of the “couple of games” nature and not more season long write offs.\nI don’t want to dwell too much on the harsh hand we’ve been dealt this season, so let’s end on a positive note.\nNewcastle came from behind to win for the first time this season, against one of the toughest opponents remaining. We have a home game against a team in woeful form to try and capitalise and despite our problems there are a few players showing a bit of magic that may influence a positive ending. Other results saw us end Saturday one point off that final European place and if the momentum can be successfully harnessed then inroads higher than the dizzy heights of seventh are feasible as early as this time next week. Maybe, at this time of year it’s appropriate time for a bit of faith and hope, but please a bit less charity towards opposition counter attacks.\nEddie’s Mags, honouring Easter as the time for the greatest comebacks.\nStats via BBC Sport:\nNewcastle 4 West Ham 3 – Saturday 30 March 12.30pm\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nIsak 6 pen, 77 pen, Barnes 83, 90 (Gordon red card 90+4)\nWest Ham:\nAntonio 21, Kudus 45+10, Bowen 48\nPossession was West Ham 40% (37%) Newcastle 60% (63%)\nTotal shots were West Ham 9 (6) Newcastle 24 (12)\nShots on target were West Ham 4 (3) Newcastle 9 (4)\nCorners were West Ham 4 (2) Newcastle 3 (1)\nReferee: Robert Jones\nNewcastle team v West Ham:\nDubravka; Livramento (Almiron 56 (Barnes 67)), Lascelles (Krafth 17 (Hall 57)), Schar, Burn; Longstaff, Guimaraes, Willock (Anderson 57); Murphy, Isak, Gordon\nSubs:\nKarius, Dummett, Ritchie, White\nYou can follow the author on Twitter @Mr_Dolf\n(BBC Sport comments from ‘neutrals’ – Interesting on Newcastle United after West Ham thriller – Read HERE)\n(David Moyes embarrasses himself with comments after Newcastle 4 West Ham 3 thriller – Read HERE)\n(Eddie Howe absolutely loving what he saw today – That’s the beauty… Read HERE)\n(Newcastle 4 West Ham 3 – Instant Newcastle United fan / writer reaction – Read HERE)\n(Newcastle 4 West Ham 3 – Never ever doubt the character of this Newcastle United squad – Read HERE)\n(This is the photo that all Newcastle United fans will absolutely love today… See HERE)\nNewcastle United confirmed Premier League matches to mid-April 2024:\nTuesday 2 April 2024 – Newcastle v Everton (7.30pm) TNT Sports\nSaturday 6 April 2024 – Fulham v Newcastle (3pm)\nSaturday 13 April 2024 – Newcastle v Spurs (12.30pm) TNT Sports\nWednesday 24 April 2024 – Crystal Palace v Newcastle (8pm)\nSaturday 27 April 2024 – Newcastle v Sheff Utd (3pm)\nNewcastle United fixtures, including to be confirmed matches:\nSaturday 4 May 2024 – Burnley v Newcastle\nSaturday 11 May 2024 – Newcastle v Brighton\nSunday 19 May 2024 – Brentford v Newcastle (4pm)\n***Man U v Newcastle waiting for rearranged date\nWednesday 22 May 2024 – Tottenham v Newcastle (at MCG – Melbourne Cricket Ground)\nFriday 24 May 2024 – A-League All Stars team v Newcastle (at Marvel Stadium, Melbourne)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
