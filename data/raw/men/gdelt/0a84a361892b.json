  "body_text": "Report: Thomas Tuchel's England manager salary revealed\n- Tuchel will take charge of England from January 2025\n- The former Bayern Munich boss has accepted a pay-cut to join the Three Lions\n- Gareth Southgate was on a similar wage\nEngland have reportedly handed Thomas Tuchel an annual salary worth as much as £5m, which represents a considerable dip compared to his wage at Bayern Munich.\nTuchel's departure from Bayern was confirmed in February, but he stayed on for the rest of the season and turned down the club's attempts to convince him to continue his tenure over the summer. Manchester United were interested in the former Chelsea boss during the off-season, but England won the race to snap up the in-demand Champions League winner.\nThe Football Association were able to lure Tuchel into the first international management role of his career while offering a yearly wage in the range of £4.5m and £5m according to Sky Sport Germany's Florian Plettenberg.\nThe 51-year-old coach was still contracted to Bayern Munich until June 2025 but will be able to terminate his deal and take over England from January without a transfer fee, according to the German publication.\nHow Thomas Tuchel's England salary compares to Gareth Southgate\nReports over Gareth Southgate's England salary vary, although most accept that his final pay-packet was worth £5m a year. The Mirror claim that the divisive coach was entitled to a basic annual wage of £2.5m - half of Tuchel's sum - but had \"big incentives and bonuses\" included in the deal. Considering Southgate won more knockout games than any other England men's coach since 1966 put together, he will have hit plenty of those targets.\nFabio Capello, who banked a reported £6m-per-year, is the only England boss to have ever earned more than Tuchel or his predecessor.\nWhile the incoming German is on a comparable salary scale to his male counterparts, his wage still considerably outstrips the highly successful manager of England's senior women's team, Sarina Wiegman.\nA significant pay-bump when signing a contract extension in January 2024 ensured that the European Championship winner became the highest-paid women's coach in the world, but that undisclosed fee is in the region of £1.3m according to The Guardian, roughly a quarter of Tuchel's wage.\nHow Thomas Tuchel's England salary compares to the best-paid managers in the world\nTuchel took home around £7.5m per year while in charge of Bayern Munich. The 51-year-old's new salary represents a pay drop, taking him out of the running as one of the best-paid coaches in the game.\nSaudi Arabia's Roberto Mancini enjoys the most lucrative contract, raking in a staggering sum of £21.5m per year, according to GiveMeSport. The Premier League's title challengers, Pep Guardiola of Manchester City (£20m) and Arsenal's Mikel Arteta (£15m), are next in the economic pyramid.\nEngland can't compete with those lofty figures, but Tuchel's wage would make him the sixth-best paid manager in the Premier League, entitled to roughly the same sum as Tottenham Hotspur's Ange Postecoglou.\nIn the international sphere - aside from the outliers of Saudi Arabia - Tuchel will be one of the best-paid bosses. Southgate's equivalent salary ensured that he was the top earner among all the managers at Euro 2024, per Football Finance.",
