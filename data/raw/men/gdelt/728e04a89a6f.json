We’re on the same page. We’re hurt.\n“These are things that can happen in football; you can’t always win.\n“We have the same idea. We haven’t had a clash with the club because we’re always in the same boat.\n“Anyone who talks about a clash with the president isn’t telling the truth.”\nAncelotti’s men are still in with a chance of retaining their LaLiga crown and winning the Copa del Rey but if they fail to triumph in either, the 65-year-old is likely to leave the club this summer.",
