We would have tried for sure. But what I can tell you is 99 out of 100 times if you play 56 minutes against this team with 10 men, you’re going to lose and you’re going to lose by a lot of goals.\"\nThat Arsenal conceded so late given fourth official Andy Madley had signalled there would be seven minutes of stoppage time just added to Arteta’s frustration.\nHe said he was happy to let others draw their own conclusions on Trossard’s red card.\nThe incident came just a week after Gunners midfielder Declan Rice served a one-match ban for getting a second yellow for kicking the ball away.\nTrossard, having already been booked, barged Silva in the back, then kicked the ball away. The Premier League confirmed he was shown a second yellow for the latter offence by referee Michael Oliver.\nArsenal fans were quick to seize on City winger Jeremy Doku doing what they felt was the same thing earlier in the game and escaping without sanction.\nBut there did appear to be a fundamental difference in that Doku was kicking the ball into the general area in which Oliver wanted Arsenal to take their free-kick.\n\"I've seen it and it's that obvious so I'll leave it to you guys,\" said Arteta.\nWhen it was pointed out kicking the ball away is a yellow-card offence, Arteta said: \"I prefer not to comment. You analyse the situation and how long it takes.\"\nArteta refused to comment when he was quizzed about perceived time-wasting tactics, which were the reason for game continuing longer than anticipated.\nHowever, speaking to BBC Match of the Day, City defender Stones was critical of Arsenal's approach.\n\"They slow the game down,\" he said. \"They get the keeper on the floor so they can get some information on to the pitch. We had to control our emotions during those tough times.\n\"I wouldn't say they have mastered it but they have done it for a few years now so we knew to expect that. You can call it clever or dirty, whichever way you want to put it, but they break up the game which upsets the rhythm.\n\"They use it to their advantage and we dealt with it very well.\"\nCity captain Kyle Walker said on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"As a football match, it is a great spectacle for the Premier League. Probably not so much certain stuff - I think it’s part and parcel of the game and we'll say the dark arts.\n\"I think as a Manchester City fan or player, you are obviously frustrated. As an Arsenal manager, he is going to say well played and well managed.\"\nAfter Erling Haaland gave City the lead, the hosts were upset at the build-up to Riccardo Calafiori’s equaliser. Arsenal were allowed to take a quick free-kick by referee Oliver as Walker was returning to his position after being summoned for a chat along with opposite number Bukayo Saka.\nManager Pep Guardiola kicked his chair in the City dugout in frustration and made his feelings known to fourth official Madley both at the time and the end of the game.\nAnd, while he acknowledged his side should have taken control of the situation by shuffling their remaining defenders across the pitch to fill the space and standing over the ball to prevent a quick free-kick, he also said in future he would tell Walker not to go to the referee if such a situation occurred and ask the official to go to him.\nCity earlier lost midfielder Rodri to injury 21 minutes into the game when he appeared to twist his knee while tangling with Arsenal's Thomas Partey.\nRodri also went down following a collision with Kai Havertz in the opening seconds, but that was not deemed punishable by the video assistant referee (VAR).\n\"It all started in the very first second. In the first action we realised what was going to happen,\" added Silva.\n\"We had a player injured after they sent him to the ground twice in 10 minutes. We had a goal conceded after the referee called our captain and then didn't allow him to recover his position.\n\"The second goal is already their usual block to our keeper allowed by the referee. And then the referee allowed a sequence of time-wasting events.\n\"The thing that bothers me the most is having a lot of meetings with the FA at the beginning of each season. They tell us they will control this kind of situation and will stop them, but at the end it doesn't have any worth. They say a lot but nothing happens.\"\nAsked about the difference between City's rivalry with Arsenal to the one they shared with Liverpool during the Jurgen Klopp era, Silva continued: \"I don't know. Maybe that Liverpool have already won a Premier League, Arsenal haven't. That Liverpool have won a Champions League, Arsenal haven't.\n\"Liverpool always faced us face-to-face to try to win the games, so by this perspective the games against Arsenal haven't been like the ones we had and have against Liverpool.\"\nThe controversy contributed to a thrilling afternoon that will live long in the memory - but Arteta said he wished the game had not turned on refereeing decisions.\n\"I cannot be happy,\" the Spaniard said at the end of his post-match media conference.\n\"I want to be involved in a game at this level that puts the game in a situation that we can enjoy and talk about it in the proper way. We’re not talking about that. It's clear. You haven't asked me one single tactical question.\"\nLatest Stories\n-\nThe Accra Mandate: Securing Africa’s AI Future through Local Data and Ethical Governance\n15 minutes -\nAquafresh donates to National Chief Imam ahead of Ramadan\n40 minutes -\nAdopt a mix of bond and short-term finance to address financing challenges in cocoa industry – Professor Peprah to government\n42 minutes -\nNSA introduces dual authentication system for 2025/26 enrolment exercise\n2 hours -\nFuel prices to increase from Feb. 16, influenced by cedi’s depreciation\n2 hours -\nGNFS to launch automated fire safety compliance system to modernise regulation\n2 hours -\nNALAG president commends Local Gov’t Minister for payment of assembly members’ allowances\n3 hours -\nIs having a physical security operations center in your business worth it?\n3 hours -\nAsiedu Nketia recounts fierce political wars in Ajumako-Enyan-Essiam constituency\n3 hours -\nNRSA sets up committee to probe road crashes involving Toyota Voxy\n3 hours -\nCocoa farmers decry the adverse impact of producer price cut on livelihoods\n3 hours -\nFamilies who lose relatives to ‘no bed syndrome’ must sue health facilities – Dr. Nawaane\n3 hours -\nGhana Sports Fund: Dr. David Kofi Wuaku outlines vision for Youth Empowerment growth through sports\n3 hours -\nNUGS President urges sustainable digital governance\n3 hours -\nNational Investment Bank kicks off Ghana Sports Fund with landmark seed donation\n3 hours",
