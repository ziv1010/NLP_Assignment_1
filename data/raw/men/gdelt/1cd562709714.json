  "body_text": "On September 20, 2018, an unusual football match took place in Leipzig, Germany, setting a precedent that could soon be of great interest to some of the biggest teams in world football.\nRB Leipzig hosted Red Bull Salzburg in the first round of the Europa League group stage. The Austrians won a feisty encounter that saw the Germans pull back level from two goals down before Norwegian striker Fredrik Gulbrandsen bagged a late winner for Salzburg.\nThe game was unusual because both clubs are part of the Red Bull soft drinks empire.\nAdvertisement\nThe firm, headquartered in Salzburg, bought its local football club in 2005. Four years later, Red Bull bought the licence of a tiny German team and effectively founded RB Leipzig as a new club. Leipzig raced up the divisions and qualified for the Champions League on multiple occasions by finishing high in the Bundesliga. (Leipzig do not carry the name ‘Red Bull’ but are called ‘RasenBallsport Leipzig’, literally meaning ‘lawn ball sports’, to circumvent German rules on corporate naming.)\nUEFA had initially deemed the clubs could not play each other because of ownership links but later, after Salzburg made a range of commercial and governance changes, European’s governing body allowed it as long as the two clubs did not share “decisive influence”.\nThis is a phrase that may well be of interest to Manchester United fans after Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad bin Jaber Al Thani, chairman of one of Qatar’s biggest banks, and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, chairman of the INEOS chemicals group, publicly declared they were bidding for Manchester United last week.\nRatcliffe already owns Nice in France and Lausanne-Sport in Switzerland. Sheikh Jassim does not own any other clubs and proposes to buy United through his own foundation, the Nine Two Foundation.\nParis Saint-Germain have been owned by Qatari Sports Investments (QSI) since 2011, and Sheikh Jassim and those who run QSI are part of the ruling elite in Qatar. Can owners who know each other so well ever be truly separate in a tiny monarchy where wealth generally has close ties to those who make the decisions?\nThe same owner cannot control a majority of shareholder voting rights or have the power to appoint and remove a majority on the board for more than one club in UEFA competition, says Daniel McDonagh, an associate at Charles Russell Speechlys specialising in sports law.\nAdvertisement\nSince ENIC, the investment company that now owns Tottenham Hotspur, tested the water with its ownership of three European clubs — AEK Athens, Vicenza Calcio and Slavia Prague — it has been a thorny issue.\nVirtually every football competition or league has some sort of provision on common ownership because of potential conflicts of interest that could undermine fair competition — or even just the perception of it.\n“This is a key point in sports governance,” says Charlie Court, an associate in the sports division at law firm Farrer and Co. “Potential or perceived conflicts of interest should be given as much weight as actual conflicts given the importance of maintaining the integrity of sporting competition.”\nThis is not an issue that is going away any time soon, though, as multi-club ownerships are becoming more and more popular in world football. But the Red Bull and ENIC cases tell us a lot about what is and is not acceptable — and why this potentially matters for Manchester United.\nThe ENIC case\nLet’s go back a quarter of a century and look at the case involving the investment company that now owns Tottenham Hotspur.\nAt the time, ENIC owned a controlling stake in AEK Athens, Vicenza Calcio and Slavia Prague. All three made it to the quarter-finals of the 1997-98 UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup. By chance, the teams were not drawn against each other, but the issue concerned UEFA.\n“It led to the imposition of the original UEFA regulations on multi-club ownership, framed as regulations on clubs’ independence,” says Daniel McDonagh. “The consequence of the new regulations was that only one club from the ownership group could play in a given competition, so Slavia Prague were allowed into the UEFA Cup for the following season but AEK Athens was not, despite otherwise having qualified.”\nAdvertisement\nThe clubs took UEFA to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which ended up siding with European football’s governing body. So too did the European Commission, which determined UEFA’s rules were consistent with EU competition law.\n“Since then, the rules on club independence have been a mainstay in UEFA’s regulations,” says McDonagh.\nThe Red Bull case\nThese UEFA rules became pertinent again in the mid-to-late 2010s when Leipzig and Salzburg were doing well in their respective leagues and the prospect of a European clash loomed large. UEFA initially decided the two could not play against each other in May 2017 when both clubs qualified for next season’s Champions League.\nReports commissioned by UEFA “show the existence of several links between the legal entity Red Bull GmbH (‘Red Bull’) and the Clubs (as well as between the Clubs themselves) which point to Red Bull having ‘decisive influence’ over each of (Salzburg) and (Leipzig) in contravention of Article 5.01(c)(iv) of the UEFA Champions League regulations.”\nThe relevant clause states:\n“To ensure the integrity of the UEFA club competitions, the following criteria apply (…) no individual or legal entity may have control or influence over more than one club participating in a UEFA club competition, such control or influence being defined in this context as (…) being able to exercise by any means a decisive influence in the decision making of the club.”\nThe key phrase is ‘decisive influence’, a far broader and less specific stipulation than other related clauses, such as restricting common ownership for those who hold “a majority of the shareholders’ voting rights” for two clubs.\n“In the Leipzig and Salzburg case, there was no straightforward shared ownership,” says Court. “However, Red Bull allegedly had various aspects of corporate and commercial influence over both clubs.”\nSo the two clubs set out to demonstrate that Red Bull did not have a decisive influence over both.\nAdvertisement\n“On appeal — and after Salzburg in particular made significant structural changes in respect of its relationship with Red Bull — the UEFA Adjudicatory Chamber allowed both Leipzig and Salzburg to compete,” says Court. “Red Bull basically stepped back from Salzburg in various ways.”\nUEFA’s judgement lists various changes made by Salzburg in an attempt to address the possibility of Red Bull’s decisive influence.\nSalzburg removed certain individuals “allegedly linked to Red Bull (and who were also simultaneously involved with RBL)” from its board, while the chairman — “an individual who was allegedly linked to Red Bull” — resigned from his position.\nLoan agreements and a cooperation agreement between the clubs were terminated, while a sponsorship deal between Salzburg and Red Bull was altered.\nThe club also committed to address “the situation regarding the lease of its stadium from a Red Bull-related entity” as well as address “branding and visual identity”.\nUEFA ended up deciding that Red Bull did not in fact have a “decisive influence” over Salzburg — so the company’s relationship with Leipzig was irrelevant.\nThen the clubs were drawn against each other (while wearing very similar kits both carrying the Red Bull logo) in 2018. Salzburg won the chaotic first tie, then faced Leipzig again.\nIt was four games into the group stage and Salzburg were running away with the group after racking up four straight wins. Meanwhile, Celtic were vying with Leipzig for the second spot. Scotland’s Daily Record published an article saying: “Are Celtic fans right to fear Salzburg and Leipzig carve-up?”\nThe two were set to play each other with Leipzig needing the points to get through ahead of Celtic, while a win for the German club would do nothing to undermine the Austrians’ progress.\nThe worries were unfounded, with Salzburg beating Leipzig 1-0 at home on the way to winning all six games in the group stage.\nAdvertisement\n“The Red Bull case sets the parameters for what constitutes having ‘decisive influence’ in more than one club and specifically it determines that the bar is high,” says McDonagh. “The person or entity in question has to be able to ‘direct the decision making of both clubs’.”\nThis means that if one owner can argue its influence is not “decisive”, UEFA still allows for a lot of overlap, as is the case with Leipzig and Salzburg.\n@media (min-width:500px) {.iframe-podcast-height {height: 200px;}}@media (max-width:500px) {.iframe-podcast-height {height: 165px;}}\nThe multi-club world\nLast week, UEFA’s Club Licensing Benchmarking report described multi-club ownership as having the “potential to pose a material threat to the integrity of European club competitions”. There are many examples.\nFollowing Abu Dhabi’s takeover of Manchester City in 2008, City Football Group acquired several other teams including Mumbai City, Melbourne City and New York City, as well as Italian side Palermo, currently in Serie B, who could feasibly play their English sister club in Europe one day.\nArsenal owner Stan Kroenke owns Major League Soccer side Colorado Rapids, which is not a conflict of interest, at least for UEFA, though the club could play each other in the Club World Cup one day.\nMany Premier League owners now also have interests in European clubs. Tony Bloom’s Brighton have loaned several players to Union Saint-Gilloise before using them in the Premier League. Brentford have close links to Danish side Midtjylland — both are owned by Matthew Benham. While both Brighton and Brentford have historically played in England’s lower divisions, the teams are now sixth and eighth respectively in the Premier League and could qualify for a UEFA competition next season — and come up against their owners’ clubs.\nAdvertisement\nJohn Textor is the majority owner of Lyon in France and a co-owner of Crystal Palace in the Premier League, as well as owning RWD Molenbeek in the Belgian second tier. And just last week, Aston Villa’s co-owners announced plans to buy 46 per cent of top-flight Portuguese club Vitoria.\nThe model works well if one club is clearly dominant, allowing it to leverage player transfers and use loans to give its developing players meaningful game time. But it’s more complicated if both clubs have aspirations of European football, especially with the number of European slots increasing due to the formation of the Europa Conference League last season.\n“An interesting risk of multi-club European ownership is that the rules are inflexible as to which club would be ruled ineligible,” Court says. “If two clubs under common ownership qualify for the same European competition, priority will be given to the one finishing higher in the domestic league, which may very well not be the most prestigious club.”\nBut if clubs can argue they do not share “decisive influence”, they are free to play against each other.\nUnited may not be the only English club looking up the small print of the Red Bull case in the coming months and years.\n“As valuations increase, the pool of potential purchasers reduces,” says Court. “And of course the businesses and investors have themselves become more specialised.”\nThere may be many clubs, but potential owners are few.\n(Top photo: Salzburg versus Leipzig in 2018; by Robert Michael/AFP via Getty Images)",
