I just speak a lot about football. I’m very happy here and I like how the fans think of me here.\n\"Let the people speak. We have to get Europe [football] again, try for Champions League. I know it’s difficult but definitely [we are aiming] for Europa League.\n\"I enjoy my time here. The fans have been unbelievable for me and my family. I hope this can keep going for a long time.\"\nGuimaraes and Newcastle will continue their quest to book their place in Europe when they face off against Bournemouth on Saturday.",
