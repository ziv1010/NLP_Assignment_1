This is a special place with a special group of players and staff and we all believe there is a great future ahead of us here, so I am delighted to have agreed a new deal.”\nOur head coach joined us from Swedish side FC Rosengard in June 2021 and led us to a second-place finish in the Barclays Women’s Super League and in his first season with the club.\nLast season, we won the 2023 FA Women's Continental Tyres League Cup after defeating Chelsea in the final and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Women’s Champions League.\n“We’ve made great progress on and off the pitch over the last couple of years and we are all working hard to continue that growth every single day. Our ambition is to be competing for the highest honours in women’s football consistently and we all believe we are capable of achieving that.\n“I’d also like to say a special thank you to our supporters. From the moment I arrived, I’ve felt your warm support and it means the world. Home or away, our supporters never fall short – to represent this club, this community, is an honour. Together, we can achieve so much.”\nSporting Director Edu said: “We’re delighted to have agreed a new contract with Jonas. This is an exciting time for our women’s first team as we approach a new season and this announcement is an important sign of our renewed commitment to the journey ahead. As a club, our aim is to be challenging at the top of the game and Jonas will play a key role in us achieving that.”\nHead of Women’s Football Clare Wheatley said: “Jonas is a crucial part of what we are building here at Arsenal and we’re very pleased to say he has signed a new deal with us. He has overseen real progress since joining us in 2021, winning his first silverware and guiding us to the semi-finals of the Champions League last year. Jonas shares our ambitions for our club and we are looking forward to working towards them together over the coming years.”\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
