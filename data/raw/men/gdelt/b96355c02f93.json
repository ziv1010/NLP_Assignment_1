  "body_text": "Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe will be busy this summer as he has a lot of issues to address concerning his squad.\nThe Magpies suffered an injury crisis last season and lost two of their centre-backs and their goalkeeper to long term injuries.\nThose injuries hampered their season and that has made the club decide that they need depth in the squad along with more quality to once again challenge for a place in the Champions League.\nIn order to do that, they are targeting a move for a wide attacker and according to information provided by journalist Ben Jacobs to GiveMeSport, the Magpies could make a move for Leeds United attacker Crysencio Summerville.\nWith Leeds failing to win promotion to the Premier League, a lot of their players are expected to leave the club this summer.\nArchie Gray has already joined Tottenham and more departures can be expected in the coming weeks.\nSummerville was their best player last season as he scored 20 goals in the Championship and added nine assists to his numbers.\nHis output was outstanding in the second tier of English football and his fine form has alerted some of the biggest clubs in the country.\nJacobs told GiveMeSport:\n“We obviously also know that Newcastle were one of the clubs that approached for Michael Olise, which sort of shows you that they’re looking for that wide, creative, minded player. And although the cost of Olise was too high for Newcastle to proceed, there’ll be other options on the market that I’m sure Newcastle feel are within their budget.\n“Crysencio Summerville could be one to watch, although no approach has yet been made to Leeds United.”\nSigning Summerville is a no brainer for Newcastle\nNewcastle wanted Michael Olise at the club this summer but his move to Bayern Munich has changed their transfer plans.\nMaking a move for Summerville would make sense as he is player of the similar profile who not only creates chances from the wide areas but also possesses the ability to score goals.\nAlong with attackers like Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak, Summerville can form a devastating attack at St. James’ Park next season.",
