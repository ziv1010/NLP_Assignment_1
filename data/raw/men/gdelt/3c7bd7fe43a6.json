Remember him saying he wanted £150 million for him.\n‘I know like now we can all jump back and say ‘yeah David Moyes was right’ but Declan from the time he’s been at Arsenal he’s made that fee look embarrassing.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nWhat did Moyes say about Declan Rice's transfer fee?\n‘I used to get criticised when I said he should be £150million,’ said Moyes before Everton’s 1-1 draw against Arsenal last weekend.\n‘When I see Arsenal supporters, I tell them they owe me £50m because we only got £100m for him. I think he’s proven exactly what we thought he was, which is a top player. He was an unbelievable example to young players at West Ham with how he conducted himself.\n‘He was coming out of contract and planning to leave West Ham and he was applauded everywhere he went because of his actions. He dealt incredibly well with it. I said he will eventually be an England captain and I think everyone would agree he is heading in that direction.’\nArteta, Rice and a host of his teammates were quick, meanwhile, to point out that the tie against Real is only at the halfway stage with next week’s second leg at the Bernabeu anything but a forgone conclusion.\nArsenal’s defensive record in Europe this season gives genuine hope for optimism, especially after Jakub Kiwior deputised so ably for the injured Gabriel but Wright is taking nothing for granted.\nHe said: ‘[On Arsenal beating Real Madrid] It was an amazing game. I think everybody played well – [Jacob] Kiwior did very well and so did Thomas Partey.\n‘Especially [Bukayo] Saka, being 50% fit – he was amazing. The manager has always gone on about the group and their mentality and they had to show it in that game.\nHow much is Declan Rice really worth?\nArsenal smashed their club record to sign Rice from West Ham in the summer of 2023 and it’s hard to argue his value would’ve done anything but have inflated since then.\nHis contract is not due to expire until 2028 with Arsenal retaining an option to extend for another 12 months.\nRice will, likely, be seeking a new deal come the summer of 2026 and a potential pay rise, should he continue his outstanding form at the heart of his side’s engine room.\nPromotion to vice-captaincy seems inevitable and he could even be destined for the armband depending on the long-term future of current skipper Martin Odegaard.\nThough Arsenal wouldn’t countenance selling him and Rice appears in it for the long-haul, he would surely command a fee in excess of what the Gunners paid for him, especially considering the way he has outperformed fellow Premier League £100 million purchases Ezno Fernandez and Moises Caicedo.\n‘There were times that I thought Real Madrid played well and the crowd were going off it in that place.\n‘Real Madrid have never come back from a 3-0 down in the first leg. They’ve never done that so hopefully we won’t be the first. However, they have players that can score goals quickly.’\nMore Trending\nWhether Rice is capable of repeating his dead ball magic remains to be seen, but Roy Keane was not surprised to see the 26-year-old leave Thibaut Courtois grasping for thin air twice in the space of unforgettable 12 minutes.\n‘Declan Rice has great technique in terms of striking the ball,’ said Keane. ‘Those two goals against Real Madrid, I was not that shocked that he did it. He has got that in his locker. The second goal was fantastic though.\n‘If Rice can keep getting more goals, then he can be on a whole different level like some of the greater players out there. The goals add to it.”\n‘However, Nottingham Forest are exciting to watch.’\nMORE: Ryan Gravenberch’s agent responds to angry Liverpool fan over Real Madrid claim\nMORE: Champions League club in talks to sign Marcus Rashford ahead of Aston Villa\nMORE: Arsenal vs Brentford: Latest team news, predicted lineup and injuries",
