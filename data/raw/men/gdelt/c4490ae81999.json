We need to be consistent in what we are doing.\"\nLuiz is just one of a number of players that are performing at a different level under the Spaniard and continued his scoring streak at Villa Park.\nThe Brazilian became the first Villa player to score in six consecutive home Premier League games when his strike from the edge of the box had too much power for Alphonse Areola in the West Ham goal on 30 minutes.\nLuiz then took the chance to double his side's advantage from the penalty spot early in the second period after Edson Alvarez tripped Ezri Konsa.\nJarrod Bowen reduced West Ham's arrears just five minutes later when his shot spun off Pau Torres into the far corner for his 100th career goal.\nHowever, any hope of a Hammers' fightback was snuffed out by the in-form Watkins on an afternoon that proved a reality check for David Moyes' men.\n\"I see the players every day and know the levels. We need to play really well to keep it up with the top six teams,\" said Moyes.\n\"The players are good players but as you can see, if this is the level we need to reach, then we need to improve greatly.\"\nFresh from scoring the winner against Australia for England in a rare run out at international level as Harry Kane's understudy, Watkins blasted in his eighth goal of the season from a narrow angle.\nBailey then exemplified the impressive attacking arsenal that Villa have amassed in recent transfer windows.\nThe Jamaican was left on the bench as Nicolo Zaniolo started despite being the subject of an investigation from Italian prosecutors over a betting scandal.\nBut Bailey made the most of his 15 minutes on the field as he cut inside Nayef Aguerd with a stepover and fired into the top corner.\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
