  "body_text": "Germany midfielder Dzsenifer Marozsan has announced her international retirement four months before the start of the 2023 Women’s World Cup.\nThe 30-year-old Lyon midfielder cited the anterior cruciate ligament injury she sustained on international duty in April 2022 as the key reason for her decision.\nShe informed national team manager Martina Voss-Tecklenburg of her decision via phone call.\nGermany’s friendly against Brazil in Nuremberg next month will be Marozsan’s “farewell game”.\nAdvertisement\n“Because of my serious knee injury in spring 2022, I realised that it felt right to retire from the national team,” Marozsan said. “Missing the European Championships in England was one of many signs.\n“I remember well how I was at the 2011 World Cup, when I was also injured, didn’t even want to watch a game. Now I was the girls’ biggest fan on TV, without it hurting not to be there.\n“Added to this is the double burden, which wouldn’t be ideal. I’m in the team, I’m doing well again, but my knee isn’t the same anymore – I have to work a lot to be able to do all the training sessions and games.\n“I think it would just be too much to do internationals, preparation and the tournament.”\nMarozsan made her international debut in October 2010 and went on to earn 111 caps, scoring 33 goals.\nShe was part of the Germany side who won the 2013 European Championships and won gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics.\nThe Lyon midfielder made Germany’s 2019 World Cup squad after recovering from a pulmonary embolism but her tournament was cut short after breaking her toe in her side’s opening group game against China. Injury cost her a place at Euro 2022.\n“I have the greatest respect for Dzsenifer Marozsan’s decision,” said Voss-Tecklenburg. “She is a great personality and an outstanding footballer who has done an incredible amount for German football.\n“We all appreciate her very much in the national team and can only thank her for everything.\n“She should be given a dignified, best possible farewell. We will invite her again in April and give her one last bet against Brazil.”\nMarozsan is a four-time Champions League winner with Lyon. She finished third in the UEFA Women’s Player of the Year award for three successive years between 2015 and 2017.\nGO DEEPER\nMiedema, Mead and Putellas: Why are there so many ACL injuries in the women's game?\n(Photo: Getty Images)",
