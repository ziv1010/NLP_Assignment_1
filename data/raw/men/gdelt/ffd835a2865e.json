Yes, I coach Arsenal. Both in the “Long, Fast and Clever throw-in”. No more comments at the moment.”\nDane Gronnemark previously spent five years as throw-in coach at Liverpool during the reign of Jurgen Klopp and had most recently been working at Brentford, initially under current Tottenham boss Thomas Frank.\nIt’s out. Yes, I coach Arsenal.\nBoth in the “Long, Fast and Clever throw-in ⚽️ No more comments at the moment.#arsenal #premierleague #championsleague #throwincoach #thomasgronnemark pic.twitter.com/XvkVDu6Cop— Thomas Gronnemark (@ThomasThrowin) January 13, 2026\nBefore moving to the Premier League, he worked with a number of clubs in his native Denmark including Viborg, FC Midtjylland, Silkeborg and Horsens.\nPrior to his football career, Gronnemark, who previously held the world record for the longest-ever throw-in, was a sprinter and later a member of the Danish bobsled team.\nArteta will hope that he can give Arsenal yet another decisive edge as they continue to fight for trophies on four different fronts this season.\nThe Gunners currently sit top of the Premier League table, six points clear of both closest challengers Manchester City and Aston Villa ahead of Saturday’s trip to Nottingham Forest.\nArsenal beat London rivals Chelsea 3-2 in the pulsating first leg of their blockbuster Carabao Cup semi-final tie on Wednesday night, having also brushed aside Championship opposition in Portsmouth on Sunday to reach the fourth round of the FA Cup, where they will host League One side Wigan next month.\nArteta’s men also occupy top spot in the league phase table in the Champions League, winning six out of six games so far, conceding only one goal and scoring 17.\nThey are three points ahead of second-place Bayern Munich, with final league phase fixtures to come against Inter Milan and debutants Kairat Almaty in January.",
