In front of media from across the globe, he responded when asked when he decided to join the club that it was, “Since I was a kid. Before it was a dream. When I became a professional, it became an objective. I took the decision when I was a kid, and now I have the luck of being here and I’m very happy and want to enjoy.”\nMbappé: “I decided to join Real Madrid when I was a kid”\nThe club’s latest signing spoke to the press for the first time as a Real Madrid player\nMbappé on how it feels to be a Real Madrid player\n“It’s an honour and a privilege to be a Real Madrid player. It’s historic for me, my family and my friends. I expected a great day but it’s been even better. I want to thank the club for their efforts.”\nMbappé on the effort he made to sign\n“I feel privileged to be able to say I’m a Real Madrid player. I dreamt about this as a kid. Dreams can’t be bought, I dreamt about playing for Real Madrid and that’s a great satisfaction for me and my family. There were many stages, but now I’m here and I want to focus on the present.”\nMbappé on his objectives for the first season\n“I’m at the biggest club in the world. I come with ambition to win, that’s in the values of the club. I want to fit in well in the team, which is a great team, and I want to adapt to help the team as much as possible.”\nMbappé on what happened to stop him joining in 2022\n“It could have happened three years ago too, but they are things that happen as a footballer. I want to focus on the present and enjoy every second with my family.”\nMbappé on where he fits in to Real Madrid’s attack\n“I’ll play where the coach tells me. I can play anywhere in a front three, I did at Paris and with France, and Monaco. I just want to be good mentally and physically. I just want to be on the pitch, obviously, and help Real Madrid, I don’t mind where.”\nMbappé on how it feels to join\n“Like I said, I had a lot of pressure this morning when I woke up, feeling like I had to enjoy and not get nervous on such an incredible day. The passion and affection the fans have shown me makes me feel like the fans have adopted me, and I am grateful for that. I now have that connection with our fans and I’ve made my dream come true.”\nMbappé on meeting his new colleagues\n“We met, but didn’t talk about tactics. It was great to meet the players, the staff, everyone at Valdebebas. Vini, Bellingham and so on are great players, but at Real Madrid every player is a great player. I’ve played against Real Madrid before, but now I’m very happy to be a Real Madrid player.”\nMbappé on his first memory as a Madridista\n“I have many, I think Zidane. I followed all of his games here. Then Cristiano was my idol. Since then I haven’t been able to watch as much because I was playing. But for me this is a dream, to have the privilege of going to sleep saying that I’m a Real Madrid player, I’ll never forget this day.”\nMbappé on what he will bring to the team\n“Real Madrid is a team that always win, that’s why it’s the best team in the world. I just want to help the team, adapt quickly and give my team-mates everything they ask of me. I can’t wait to start training.”\nMbappé on if he ever doubted that he would join\n“No, I never doubted. I had many offers, but I always said that when I leave Paris, I only want to go to Madrid. In my head it was clear. In football you never know, but this was clear for me that Real Madrid was my next club and today I’m very happy.”\nMbappé on whether his nose will need an operation\n“I’m at the club’s disposal and we’re in regular contact. I’ll go on holiday and when I’m back, the club will have the results and tell me how I can help the team as quickly as possible.”\nMbappé on Florentino Pérez\n“He’s trusted and helped me and my family since the first day. That’s very important because I’m a man as much as a player. This relationship with the president and everyone else who works here has helped me.”\nMbappé on who from the squad encouraged him to join\n“The French guys said it a lot, Vini too because I know him and he sent me messages saying to come here and play with him. I didn’t need any of the players to tell me that Real Madrid is the best club in the world, but it helped.”\nMbappé on how he will change his physical game\n“The truth is that we spoke this morning with Pintus and his team to prepare a good schedule after a long season. I want to prepare well for a long season and we’ll do that with the staff over the summer.”\nMbappé on how he took criticism in 2022\n“It’s part of football. Sometimes people love you, other times they are angry with you. The love I’ve had from Madridistas has been incredible, I haven’t even played a game and the fans are showing me so much love. That’s why I’ll give my life for this club, badge and shirt. They have trusted in me and I need to do things well on and off the pitch for them, my family and myself to enjoy every second.”\nMbappé on when he could debut\n“We’ll see what we need to do. I’m sure I’ll be able to play the Super Cup, but that depends on the coach. I’ll work to be ready and try to win my first title, but that’s a question for the coach.”\nMbappé on the comeback against PSG at the Bernabéu in 2022\n“You know when you come to the Bernabéu that you’re playing the best club in the world. When I was with Paris I was focused on that, not on other stadiums or clubs. Now I want to win with Real Madrid.”\nMbappé on the weight of the club’s history\n“Yes, it’s a historic and legendary club. That weighs on you when you put on the shirt. It’s magnificent and this is an incredible day. I’ve played at big clubs before, like Monaco and PSG, but this is the biggest club in the world. It’s a pleasure to be here and I hope to be up to the standards.”\nMbappé on his relationship with Cristiano Ronaldo\n“As a kid, I wanted to be Cristiano. We’re always in touch and he gives me advice. I want to make history at Real Madrid. It’s a pleasure to be his friend. I send him a hug.”\nMbappé on playing with Vinícius\n“He’s a great player, so is Rodrygo and everyone else at Real Madrid. I think great players can always play together. I wouldn’t have any problem to do so. He’s been great in recent seasons and now I arrive and have to adapt to help them to win.”\nMbappé on winning titles\n“I think there’s no better place to win titles, but right now the key for me is to adapt to the team’s system. I have objectives, to win the league, the Champions League, the Copa del Rey, but they are long-term, first I want to arrive and adapt.”\nMbappé on why he didn’t come sooner\n“Like I said, many things can happen in football. When I’ve won titles and played well, I was told to carry on working and not think about the bad times, now I am very happy to finally be a Real Madrid player at a club that has won everything and wants to continue winning everything.”\nMbappé on his shirt number\n“Who said I wanted the number 10? We have a number 10, Luka Modrić, who has won everything and a Ballon d’Or. I’m happy because I’m nine so I’m next to him. The number isn’t important for me, I don’t look behind, I only look forward at the goal in front of me. The nine is historic at Real Madrid, but it’s not important for me.”\nMbappé on what Zidane told him in 2012\n“I came in 2012, it was crazy to be here at 13 or 14 with Zidane. I was very excited. It was a time in my life when then I watched Cristiano’s presentation and I told my family that I wanted to be that guy. That’s why I gave that message to the children because with passion, anything is possible, you have to work, believe in yourself and get a bit lucky.”\nMbappé on his Spanish\n“I started learning at school. I wasn’t the best at school, but I focused on Spanish because I wanted to play for Real Madrid. It’s much easier to integrate into a country if you speak the language. I’ve had coaches like Luis Enrique or Pochettino who speak Spanish. If I make mistakes, tell me, I want to improve my Spanish.”\nMbappé on the record-breaking attendance to his presentation\n“It’s unbelievable. I didn’t expect so much, it’s been marvellous to receive this welcome in Madrid. Whenever I’ve been in Spain, playing against Real Sociedad, fans have always welcomed me, and I have to recognise and thank them for that.”\nMbappé on what caught his eye with Real Madrid\n“There is no other club like Real Madrid. Everyone has played at other clubs, but when you come here everyone says it’s unique and like nowhere else in the world and I wanted to live that experience. That’s more important than playing or winning, they live their dreams and have that passion for Real Madrid. I can see that already after one day at Valdebebas. I’m happy to be part of the Real Madrid family now.”\nMbappé on adapting quickly\n“I watched the team’s games, you can see it in reality, I know many players, what kind of passes or movements they like. When I talk about adapting, I talk about that, and personal things, I want to adapt into the team. I don’t want to come here, score goals and go home. I want to form part of the team and win as a team.”\nMbappé on when he found out the deal was done\n“I’m not in the WhatsApp group, maybe soon. I found out today when I signed the contract. Now it’s for sure. At 11am, with the president, I have a video if you want it.”\nMbappé on what he thought when he woke up this morning\n“I slept one hour, an hour and a half. I felt pressure and nerves, but I wanted to enjoy the day and take it all in. These are memories for life. It’s a unique day and I hope people can see that, I wanted to share it with as many people as possible from my family and my foundation. It’s my dream, but I wanted to share it.”\nMbappé on whether he’ll join the US tour\n“We’ll see with the coach and the club, we’ll do what they say.”\nMbappé on objectives for his first season\n“My objectives are the club’s, we want to win titles. I want to adapt, and win titles, this club will win titles before and after me but I want to win titles with the club too. I don’t like setting a maximum of goals or a limit, if it’s more assists then I’ll do that, I’m not the only player who can score goals.”\nMbappé on the Champions League\n“Real Madrid is always the favourite. We need to show that on the pitch.”\nMbappé on Endrick\n“I know his reputation, many people speak well of him, but I a haven’t seen much of him, only with the national team. If you join Real Madrid, you have talent. He’s young, and has a lot of pressure coming from Brazil, but he has to learn. If he needs help, I’ll be here for him because I know how it feels.”\nMbappé on his journey, as shown in the presentation\n“I was watching on television before coming out, it was very emotional. I wanted to enjoy everything and everyone here. It was marvellous.”",
