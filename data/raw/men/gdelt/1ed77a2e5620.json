But we know Sevilla's overall history in Europe. We know that the Champions League is number one, followed by the Europa League, but I believe the bar has been raised and this can be seen from the teams that remain [in the competition].\nThe match against Manchester United will be very tough – we know they are the favourites. We're familiar with their team and the first match is an away game. We must think about our game, and we need to be well prepared. If we achieve a good result in our away game in Manchester, then we can prepare them for hell here, at home. Our wish is to advance; it will be difficult, but we'll do our best and fight till the end.\nOn the city of Seville\nIt has been some 12 years [since I came here]. The city thrives on football, company, and family. There's a saying here that goes: \"Whoever comes to Seville once, stays in Seville.\" Whoever comes here – even if they cannot stay – they will return again and again.\n[Croatia defender] Duje Ćaleta-Car was recently staying at my place with his wife and friends. After he left, I was delighted to receive a text message yesterday saying that the city was fantastic, everything was beautiful, the people were fantastic, as well as the climate and everything else. So, anyone who comes here should stay for five or six days [at least], just in case.\nThe city is very old, and its history is rich among other things. Moreover, I am the only [Croatian] person who was allowed to marry in Seville Cathedral.\nOn returning following a spell at Barcelona\nThere were numerous options, but when the door opened up to come back home, it was perfectly clear to me, especially after talking to my wife. It was not about the contract, the money, the idea, or anything else, but about the heart. We just wanted to return to our home.\nThe club had also grown so much over those five or six years so it was also nice to try to help it develop further, if possible, considering how it grows every year. My home is in Seville; my wife is from this city, my children were born here, they go to school here and their friends are here. My close friends are here, so Seville for me means home.\nOn the prospect of a seventh UEFA Cup/Europa League success for Sevilla\nThat would be unbelievable. Here in the city, people say the Europa League is Sevilla's competition. It's something which belongs to us because we have won it six times in the last 15 or so years. Respect to everyone who's also won it, but it is somehow our competition.\nPeople here love these games, and you can feel it among the people in the city. We eagerly await those matches and it would be unbelievable to lift that trophy with Sevilla once again. We hope it will happen with God's will, but we're taking it step by step. A tough match is ahead of us, and we'll fight till the end.",
