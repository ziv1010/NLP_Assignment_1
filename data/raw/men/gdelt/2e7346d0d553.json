Aston Villa are confident to get it done also on final details by the end of this week, there’s already green light from Chelsea,” Romano posted on X.\n“Clubs are discussing the possibility to include one player in the deal, currently NOT guaranteed to be Jhon Duran.”\nAs reported by TEAMtalk, Chelsea have previously held discussions with Villa over signing Duran as they view him as one of the most promising young strikers in the Premier League.\nHowever, Villa value Duran at approximately £40m and that is considered too high for the Blues, who have moved on to other centre-forward targets.\nRomano suggests that another Villa player could move to Chelsea as part of the Maatsen deal and the jury is still out on who that could be.\nIt will be interesting to see how this story develops in the coming days, but what’s almost certain is that Maatsen will be playing his football at Villa Park in the coming season.\nDON’T MISS: How Michael Olise compares to current Chelsea attacking options; puts Palmer in the shade",
