So yes, we are looking and we are trying and let’s see what we are able to do.”\nWe’ve taken a look at nine strikers Arsenal have been linked with in recent months as they look to bolster their attacking options in January.\nEvan Ferguson\nArsenal have reportedly identified Alexander Isak as their top transfer target but Newcastle United will refuse to sanction his departure in the January transfer window.\nThe Gunners may now look at a stop-gap solution for the rest of the 2024/25 season before making a move for Isak in the summer.\nFerguson could be available on loan after struggling for consistent game time under Brighton & Hove Albion head coach Fabian Hurzeler.\n“We will negotiate what is important for him, what is important for his development, where he can improve the best and then we will make the decision together,” Hurzeler said.\n“This decision should be what is best for the player and for the club. We sent [Facundo] Buonanotte, for example, to Leicester.\n“We know that the Premier League is a very good league to improve, because it’s tough, it’s intense, especially for young players. It’s the perfect environment to adapt.”\nThe 20-year-old scored 12 goals in his first 32 Premier League appearances but has since netted just one goal in his last 27 league games.\nDespite his recent struggles, Arsenal are reportedly still interested in the striker and a loan move could help him rediscover his best form.\nBut Arsenal already have Raheem Sterling and Neto on loan and they would have to terminate one of those deals to sign Ferguson on loan.\nDusan Vlahovic\nArteta is a known admirer of Vlahovic, having previously tried to sign the Serbia international from Fiorentina in January 2022.\nJuventus won the race for his signature after forking out an initial £58million, and he has since registered 53 goals and 11 assists in 124 appearances in all competitions.\nBut the 25-year-old has struggled under new manager Thiago Motta, who prefers link-up strikers over traditional centre-forwards.\nJuventus are on the verge of agreeing a loan deal for Paris Saint-Germain forward Randal Kolo Muani and are willing to let Vlahovic leave the club this month.\nHe has less than 18 months left on his contract and Juventus want offers of €65million (£54.7m / $67.1m), although Arsenal will try to negotiate a reduced price.\nBenjamin Sesko\nSince joining RB Leipzig in the summer of 2023, Sesko has established himself as one of Europe’s most exciting young forwards.\nThe 21-year-old registered 18 goals and two assists in 42 appearances in his debut season and already has 13 goals and three assists in 2024/25.\nArsenal wanted to sign him last summer and were willing to trigger the €65million (£54.4m / US$71.4m) release clause in his contract last summer.\nBut the Slovakia international ultimately signed a new deal with the Bundesliga side and the release clause has now been removed.\nAccording to The Athletic, he wants to finish the 2024/25 season at Leipzig but the right proposition from the right club could see that position shift before the end of the January transfer window.\nArsenal remain attentive to his development and TEAMtalk understands they have told his camp they can offer him the best game time.\nWhat a strike from RB Leipzig’s 21-year-old Benjamin Sesko! 🔥\nJurgen Klopp was also in attendance to witness the stunner 👀 pic.twitter.com/tVi6myKNxy\n— Sky Sports Football (@SkyFootball) January 12, 2025\nJonathan David\nDavid has now entered the final six months of his contract at Lille and can now sign a pre-contract agreement with an overseas club.\nBut the Ligue 1 side may look to sell the striker in a cut-price deal in January in order to avoid losing him on a free transfer at the end of the season.\nHis situation has reportedly piqued the interest of some of Europe’s biggest clubs, including Arsenal, Tottenham, Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Juventus.\nThe Canada international is currently the joint-top goalscorer in Ligue 1 in 2024/25, having netted 11 goals in 17 league appearances.\nHe has also impressed in the Champions League group stage this season, scoring against Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Juventus.\nLiam Delap\nDelap left Manchester City and joined Ipswich Town last summer in a deal worth an initial £15million and another £5million on add-ons.\nThe 21-year-old has enjoyed a brilliant start to his career at Portman Road, registering eight goals and two assists in 20 Premier League appearances.\n“I have seen him quite a lot this season and I would probably go as far as to say he is the obvious long-term successor to [Harry] Kane,” Danny Murphy said. “I think he is the best young English striker out there.”\nHis impressive form has unsurprisingly attracted interest from a number of Premier League sides, including Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea and Liverpool.\nBut the Tractor Boys are likely to demand a substantial amount of money for the England Under-21 international, who has four-and-half-years left on his contract.\nHow many goals will Liam Delap score for @IpswichTown‘s this season?
