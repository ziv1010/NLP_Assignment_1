There are games I come into and think 'what's he going to come out with today' and he just comes out with different tactics every game. He's a pleasure to work with.\"\nYet stability has also been key to City's charge to Istanbul this weekend.\nTen players have started all of the last five Champions League games as the likes of Riyad Mahrez, Phil Foden and Julian Alvarez have been consistently frozen out.\nAfter thrashing Bayern 4-1 on aggregate in the quarter-finals, City took revenge on Madrid by routing the defending champions 4-0 at a jubilant Etihad Stadium in the semi-final second leg.\nGuardiola has already made City the dominant force of English football with five league titles in the past six seasons.\nHowever, he recognises that Champions League success will bring a status that no number of domestic titles can provide.\n\"So many clubs have destroyed projects and ideas because they weren't able to win this competition, and so many have become big clubs because they were able to win it,\" Guardiola told UEFA.com.\n\"Even if I don't share this opinion, I understand that everything we have done through all these years, which has been a lot and very good, will make sense to others if we win this competition.\n\"If we don't win it, then things will seem to make less sense. It's a bit unfair, but we must accept it. That's how it is.\n\"We must also accept that if we want to make a definitive step as a big club, we must win in Europe. We have to win the Champions League; that's something you can't avoid.\"\nMaking City champions of Europe will complete the project Guardiola was brought to the club to fulfil seven years ago.\nIt would also silence any remaining doubters about the Spaniard's right to be ranked among the all-time coaching greats.\n© 2023 AFP",
