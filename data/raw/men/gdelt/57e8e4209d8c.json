I have asked the players not to be distracted. I trust them completely as we look forward to claiming full points. Our aim is to continue with our lead in the QSL,” Crespo told a pre-match press conference yesterday.\nThe Asian Football Confederation (AFC) in December announced the Qatar Football Association as the host Member Association for the AFC Champions League Round of 16, quarter-finals and semi-final centralised matches in the West region.\nThe West Asian half of the last 16 pairings will also see defending champions Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia face off against Shabab Al Ahli Dubai from the United Arab Emirates, while another Saudi side Al Shabab take on FC Nasaf from Uzbekistan. Also, Al Faisaly from Saudi Arabia square off with Foolad Khouzestan from the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nMeanwhile, Crespo hinted at deciding against resting key players for today's game.\n“I always try to choose the best 11 players who are technically and physically ready and the squad is always according to the strategy of the match. There are matches that require a squad with certain technical characteristics and currently I am not thinking about our match against Al Rayyan in the AFC Champions League,” said Crespo.\n“I am happy with what the team's strikers are doing. The team has Michael Olunga, the league's top scorer and there is Nam Tae-Hee who helped the team achieve victory in the last match against Al Wakrah and there is also Almoez Ali. I cannot ask them for more. They have scored 9 goals in 4 matches, which is special,” he added.\nAl Duhail have 29 points, four clear of second-placed Al Arabi as both teams have played 12 matches each.\nAl Markhiya, who are currently placed eighth on the table with 12 points, are high in confidence after thrashing Qatar SC 4-0 in the last round.\nAl Markhiya coach Abdullah Mubarak hoped his ranks will put up a strong challenge against an in-form Al Duhail after a stunning win.\n“The match will not be easy, but it is normal for us to enter the match with the aim of achieving victory. We will play the match in good spirit after the victory achieved in the last round against Qatar SC,” he said.\n“All matches we play are difficult and we must play perfectly. Whatever the conditions, we will work to play more seriously in all matches. I will not say that we will beat Al Duhail, but we will play the match to win,” Mubarak added.\nHamad Bin Khalifa Stadium will also host two QSL Round 14 matches today with Al Sailiya taking on Umm Salal in the first match. The second match at the venue will pit Al Ahli and Al Rayyan.",
