Slot, in the early days of his reign after replacing Jurgen Klopp, said it had been a “good start, but not a perfect one”.\n“I think it´s been a positive start, with the small disappointment of losing at home against Nottingham Forest,” he said. “Every home game you lose is a disappointment, especially if it´s not against a team that´s competing for a top-four position, although you never know what Nottingham Forest are going to do this season.”\nThe Dutchman added: “The style we play, the way we play, it´s still very close to what you guys were used to for nine years, which is quite normal because we almost have all the same players Jurgen had. “Keeping the results going is a good thing. Again, I have to mention that the fixture list has been good to us.”\n-\nJames Van Der Beek's Final Conversation With Director Roger Avary Laid Bare: 'We Cried'\n-\nJaden Smith Walks Out Of Interview After Kanye West Question At Film Premiere\n-\nMichelle Obama Gets Candid About Spontaneous Decision At Piercings Tattoo\n-\nWhy Halle Berry Wasn't Ready For Marriage After Van Hunt Popped Question?
