He’s back from a cold and he’s fine; I’ll decide tomorrow whether he starts or comes off the bench. But I’m happy to have him in the team, playing for Barça.\n“I’ve followed him throughout his career and I’ve always been impressed by his quality and what he’s capable of in the box, and he’s showing that in Barcelona. This change for him, in a new style of football, in Barcelona, with the great weather… For me, it’s incredible to see how he’s always smiling. It’s the atmosphere we have here, and it’s very good for him.”\nRaphinha’s return means Rashford will likely see a slightly diminished role once the Brazilian comes back to full fitness, but Rashford will no doubt still have a big part to play as a Super Sub throughout the season.",
