Here's a look at their Champions League journey and who they could come up against next.\nReal Madrid 2022/23 Champions League so far\nCarlo Ancelotti's side predictably topped their group which contained Celtic, RB Leipzig and Shakhtar Donetsk. It was viewed as a tricky group but one they should win, and that is how the fixtures panned out.\nThey won 3-0 in Glasgow and 2-0 and 2-1 at home against Leipzig and Shakhtar respectively in the first three games to grab full control of the group, but that was followed by a draw at Shakhtar and defeat in Germany to Leipzig.\nWhile their progression to the last 16 was already secured, they needed to get a result against Celtic in Madrid on Matchday 6 to ensure they topped the group. They won 5-1 to finish first by one point despite Leipzig beating Shakhtar 4-0.\nREAD NEXT\nReal were then handed a last-16 tie against a Liverpool side they beat in the final last season but not at the peak of their powers. The visitors were 2-0 down at Anfield inside 15 minutes but rallied to win 5-2, all but winning the tie.\nThey wrapped things up with a calm 1-0 win at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu to make it 6-2 on aggregate.\nReal Madrid 2022/23 Champions League quarter-finals potential opponents\nThere are no limitations in the upcoming quarter final and semi final draws, meaning Real can be paired with any team still standing. Of the eight teams left in the tournament, there is a fairly clear 50/50 split on the quality.\nReal Madrid, Napoli, Manchester City and Bayern Munich look like the heavy favourites with Chelsea, Benfica, Inter and AC Milan the teams less likely to go deep into the competition, depending on how the draw goes.\nEven if Real Madrid are now nine points behind Barcelona in La Liga, they are just a different beast in the Champions League, particularly as the season wears on. Nobody will want to play them and they will back themselves against anyone.\nThe favourable opponents have to be either of the Milan sides, who have struggled to impress in Serie A this season and hardly stormed past Porto and Tottenham in the round of 16. Benfica are another side Real Madrid would like to face, although Roger Schmidt has his side playing some great football and they could be a surprise package.\nHere is a list of Real Madrid's potential Champions League quarter-final opponents:\n- Manchester City\n- Inter\n- Napoli\n- AC Milan\n- Bayern Munich\n- Benfica\n- Chelsea",
