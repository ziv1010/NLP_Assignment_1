Perhaps good things come to those who wait? Newly-promoted Real Valladolid — Madrid’s opponents this weekend — might see things differently.\nHere, The Athletic’s Real Madrid correspondents Mario Cortegana and Guillermo Rai take a look back at some of the club’s other ‘Galactico’ home debuts — three of which even include an appearance from Usain Bolt.\nLuis Figo\nReal Madrid v Valencia (September 9, 2000)\nFigo’s signing was one of the most dramatic in football history when he came directly from Clasico rivals Barcelona — where he was captain, too.\nDuring his presentation (three months before his debut) Madrid’s new recruit seemed to be in disbelief that he had taken this step. Spanish press reports from the time describe him as being in a “state of shock”.\nHis debut came in a 2-1 defeat by Galatasaray in the UEFA Super Cup, but at the Bernabeu we saw signs of the situation turning around.\nIn his first game at the Bernabeu, Figo’s display was one full of desire. He constantly tried to get forward and was a real danger to the Valencia defence. Even if it was not his best night in a Madrid shirt, he helped Madrid to a 2-1 win over the rival they had also beaten in the Champions League final just months before. That term Vicente del Bosque’s side would reach the semi-finals — but they also won La Liga.\nRonaldo\nReal Madrid v Alaves (October 6, 2002)\nAfter winning the World Cup with Brazil in Japan and South Korea earlier that summer, Ronaldo’s home debut with Madrid didn’t come until the fifth matchday of that La Liga season. Having been named among the substitutes, he made a slightly awkward start — banging his head on the Madrid bench, much to the amusement of his team-mates.\n📅✨ ¡Se cumplen 2️⃣0️⃣ años del debut de @Ronaldo como madridista!\n⚽⚽ @Alaves\n🏟️ Santiago Bernabéu#RealFootball pic.twitter.com/5h1URrHO2t— Real Madrid C.F. (@realmadrid) October 6, 2022\nAfter taking to the field in the 63rd minute, he was instantly involved, picking up a ball in the box with his chest and bounced the ball home on the half-volley. Some 14 minutes later he found the net again for an impressive brace in a 5-2 win.\nAdvertisement\nOn the sidelines, that early laughter quickly matched the awe and astonishment experienced in the stands. Ronaldo would be key to a season in which Madrid won La Liga and reached the Champions League semi-finals.\nDavid Beckham\nReal Madrid v Real Mallorca (August 27, 2003)\nAt a time when the revolutionary Galacticos project devised by club president Florentino Perez was in full swing, David Beckham’s home debut for Real Madrid was eagerly awaited. His entrance at the Bernabeu took place in cinematic-style, like so much else around him.\nThe scene was the second leg of the Supercopa de Espana, the tournament that opened the season in Spanish football at the time.\nJust three days earlier, Beckham had experienced a bitter first appearance in white — losing the first leg at Mallorca 2-1 despite providing an assist. “It would have been nice to play all 90 minutes,” said Beckham, who was withdrawn shortly after half-time, with the team trailing. Madrid’s new manager Carlos Quieroz took heed of his message.\nBeckham completed the return match and Madrid won 3-0 to claim a first title of the season. As right winger, moving Luis Figo to the left, Beckham scored the third goal, heading in Ronaldo’s pass in a curious reversal of roles.\n“I couldn’t imagine debuting like that at the Bernabeu, scoring and winning a title,” Beckham said. “It couldn’t have been better.”\nIt was the perfect start for the perfect signing for Perez — on and off the pitch.\nCristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, Karim Benzema\nReal Madrid v Deportivo La Coruna (August 29, 2009)\nHow about this for a stellar line-up of new signings?\nIn the summer of 2009, with Perez back as club president for a second time, Madrid spent €250million (£211m; $279m at today’s rates) in transforming their attack with the three names above (as well as improving in midfield and defence, with Xabi Alonso and Alvaro Arbeloa).\nAdvertisement\nJust like Mbappe this year, the excitement over Ronaldo’s arrival especially was huge and Madrid sold out the Bernabeu on the day of his presentation earlier that summer. By the time the first home game of the season came around, everything was in place for a captivating start. There was even a ceremonial kick-off from Usain Bolt.\nWearing the No 9 shirt (the No 7 was still worn by Raul over 2009-10), Ronaldo scored a penalty in a 3-2 win — but he missed some chances as he was in the process of adapting to the team.\nLeading the line was Karim Benzema, whose profile was not so widely celebrated but who still provided the assist for Raul’s opener. Kaka, meanwhile also played a part in Madrid’s first goal, and the Brazilian was perhaps the most impressive performer of the new faces.\nGareth Bale\nReal Madrid v Atletico Madrid (September 28, 2013)\nGareth Bale’s debut at the Bernabeu was a long time coming. First because of the eternal negotiations with Tottenham in the summer of his signing, before the Londoners ended up getting their world record figure of €101million.\nThen there was the Welshman’s physical problems. Having missed the season-opener through injury, Bale pulled up in the warm-up of Madrid’s next home match. Fans had to wait until the seventh game of the season to finally watch him at the Bernabeu.\nIt was a city derby against Atletico Madrid and he was brought on as a replacement for Angel Di Maria at half time, with Real Madrid trailing 1-0. The score would stay the same, but — with the local support up in arms over Benzema’s apparent apathy — the Welshman’s hard running was much appreciated, and he almost got a late equaliser against Thibaut Courtois, who would later become his team-mate.\nJames Rodriguez\nReal Madrid v Atletico Madrid (August 19, 2014)\nRodriguez had been one of the sensations of the World Cup in Brazil that summer, helping Colombia reach the quarter-finals and scoring the goal of the tournament. Madrid had no doubts about signing him for €80million from Monaco.\nAdvertisement\nMadrid had just won La Decima (their 10th European Cup/Champions League title) and had a star-studded squad that included Cristiano Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema. They had been joined by Toni Kroos earlier that summer, too, but Rodriguez was the icing on the cake and he made a superb debut at the Bernabeu against Atletico Madrid in the first leg of the Supercopa.\nRodriguez started from the bench, replacing Ronaldo at half time. His introduction helped shake up Madrid’s play with style and substance, and in the 83rd minute he put Carlo Ancelotti’s side ahead, scoring after a rebound.\nRaul Garcia’s equaliser just a few minutes later cooled the atmosphere somewhat, but the home fans left buzzing over their new Colombian No 10.\nEden Hazard\nReal Madrid v Levante (September 14, 2019)\nOnce variables were met in the deal that brought him to Madrid from Chelsea, Eden Hazard would replace Bale as the Spanish side’s record signing (the value reached about €120m), and some 50,000 fans gathered to celebrate his presentation despite high temperatures that June.\nBut in a sign of what was to come, Hazard’s Bernabeu debut ended up being delayed as the Belgian suffered the first of several injuries that would limit his influence at Madrid. It meant he did not make his debut until mid-September.\nThe big moment did not live up to expectations. Hazard came on for the final half hour of a 3-2 victory over Levante (he entered when the score was 3-1, replacing Casemiro), without making a huge impression. Not that he sounded disappointed.\n“From the first moment I wanted to play here,” Hazard said. ”It’s a beautiful stadium, the fans always support the team playing at home, they want to enjoy the moment, and the players want it to be like that.”\nUnfortunately for everyone involved, terrible luck with injuries meant his Madrid story didn’t get much better.\nAdvertisement\nJude Bellingham\nReal Madrid v Getafe (September 2, 2023)\nBellingham’s Bernabeu debut was one of the best in recent years for Real Madrid.\nThe Englishman had been instrumental in the season’s first three games — all played away from the Bernabeu while reconstruction work took place — and fans were supremely excited about watching a player who had scored four goals already. Once again he took centre stage.\nFrom the start, he was the focal point of Madrid’s attacking play, operating in the new position Ancelotti had fashioned for him following Benzema’s surprise departure that summer.\nBut despite Bellingham providing several dangerous passes, and having two penalties awarded that were overturned by the VAR, the match needed a dramatic late intervention for Madrid to take three points from a game in which Getafe took a surprise lead.\nBellingham provided that, too. His 95th-minute winner, adding to Joselu’s equaliser, was celebrated heartily by the home fans as full confirmation that a new star had arrived. It was by far from the only victory he delivered for Madrid last term.\n(Top photos: Getty Images)",
