When you have another chance you have to go again. He had the opportunity, finished it with class and he helps us win games.”\nBayern kept on fighting and pulled a goal back late on after a contentiously awarded Joshua Kimmich penalty but the outcome was not in doubt.\nSuch were the home side’s frustrations that manager Thomas Tuchel was sent off in the closing minutes for complaining about referee Clement Turpin’s decisions.\nCity will now play Real Madrid in the semi-finals in a rematch of last year’s encounter won by the Spanish side in dramatic circumstances.\nMidfielder Bernardo Silva has already spoken confidently of avenging that loss but De Bruyne insists that is not something that motivates him.\nHe said: “I am not that person. What happened last year happened. We played really well in the two games and the last five minutes changed the course (of the tie).\n“You have to take it on the chin and move on. It happened and it doesn’t mean we didn’t play well for the majority of the two games. Football is about details and it happens and you move on.”\nCity will travel to the Spanish capital on May 9 before hosting the reigning the champions the following week.\nPrior to that, however, they have other pressing matters with Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Sheffield United followed by a crunch top-of-the-table Premier League encounter with Arsenal four days later.\n“It is going to be a quick turnaround,” De Bruyne said. “The schedule is what it is. It is very hard for us but it is a privilege playing in all these semi-finals.\n“A lot of people want to be in our position. We are proud but we have to go on.”\nOne downside for City was defender Nathan Ake suffering a hamstring injury before being substituted in the second half. He was due to be assessed following the team’s return to Manchester.",
