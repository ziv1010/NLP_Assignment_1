That then means Alexander Isak must be sold\nIn this PSR modern day world of football, Newcastle United have been consistently accused of one thing, that the club has to vastly improve how they trade, they have to become clever sellers.\nUniversally agreed though that under Eddie Howe and these Newcastle United owners, the club had become clever buyers.\nThat very first January 2022 transfer window saw Kieran Trippier (£12m), Dan Burn (£13m) and Bruno Guimaraes (£41.65m) all bought in, stunning business I’m sure you will agree. What they have given Newcastle United has been immense these past three and a half years.\nWhilst that January 2022 £25m purchase of Chris Wood might now be seen in a ‘slightly’ different light. Callum Wilson picking up a serious injury at the end of December 2021 left Eddie Howe with not a single Premier League level striker for the relegation fight, Howe and NUFC derided for paying that £25m release clause for Wood.\nLazy people saying Chris Wood a flop at NUFC, the reality is that he was a stunning success. Eddie Howe had a plan to use the striker in an unselfish role with relegation looking all but a certainty. Yes, Chris Wood only scored two goals in the second half of that 2021/22 season BUT he was key to the fact that Newcastle not only survived, they actually had the third best form of any PL side in the entire second half of that season and picked up an amazing 29 points in the 15 games Wood started. Trippier swiftly got injured and missed almost all of that relegation fight, whilst Eddie Howe took it very slowly with Bruno, over six weeks before he got a PL (away start) and it was April 2022 before the midfielder started at St James’ Park. It was Wood, Burn and an on-loan Targett who came in and were key to helping Newcastle United avoid what would have been a disastrous relegation for the new ownership.\nFollowing that January 2022 window, we then saw further signings of the likes of Pope, Isak, Livramento, Hall, Botman, Gordon, Hall, Tonali, Alexander Isak etc etc, all stunning incoming business.\nAnyway, back to becoming good sellers\nI think in all honesty the criticism was/is laughable about Newcastle United failing to be good sellers in the years that immediately followed the takeover. To be good sellers you have to have something to sell and that others want to pay good money for.\nEddie Howe and the new owners inherited an absolute shambles from Mike Ashley and Steve Bruce, a team that was on its way to relegation and a squad not fit for purpose. The result of clueless mismanagement and a decade and a half of Ashley failing to allow proper investment in new signings.\nThe idea that Newcastle United were failing to be good sellers, where is the evidence of that??? Who are these players they could/should have sold to help offset the essential rebuilding of the first team, with rebuilding of a squad an even more overwhelming challenge.\nIf Eddie Howe had sold any of the small group of players he had inherited that other clubs were interested in buying, it would have made less than zero sense. Selling any of the small group of quality players for decent transfer fees would simply have fatally weakened the team, with serious money needing to be spent to replace them, with no guarantee that replacements would be good enough to do the job.\nTakeovers at other major Premier League clubs are almost in every case very different, when it comes to that player trading situation. They do have squad players that can be sold for good money and young players coming through the club as well, who can also attract big money.\nThese past 13 months, things have changed…\nNow imagine Newcastle United then doing deals whereby £100m of incoming transfer fees would be generated, from three departing players who had only started 17 Premier League matches for NUFC in total in their careers, plus somebody who turned 31 before playing for his new club and who had only started one PL match for Newcastle in the ten months before leaving and played only 150 PL minutes in the 2024/25 season in total.\nIt gets even better, the three outgoing players who had made only 17 NUFC Premier League starts between them, had cost only £7m in transfer fees in total. Whilst the 31 year old had cost £20m but that was six years ago.\nEven even better, from a PSR perspective these deals absolutely stunning, as all but a couple of million pounds of the £100m incoming, was pure immediate profit from a PSR angle in the club accounts.\nJust in case you haven’t already guessed, the four players in question were Elliot Anderson, Yankuba Minteh, Lloyd Kelly and Miguel Almiron.\nThe critics (especially those in the NUFC fanbase…) can’t have it all ways.\nNobody is celebrating the fact that Newcastle United sold two promising young players. However, with the situation Eddie Howe and the Newcastle United owners had been faced with, especially when it comes to PSR, those sales represented blinding business.\nThe brilliant recruitment of the likes of Isak, Tonali, Bruno, Gordon, Livramento, Hall and others, was always going to have to be paid for at some point, to be balanced out.\nNow Alexander Isak…\nThat point came in June 2024 when Anderson and Minteh were sold to avoid breaking PSR three year limits on allowable losses.\nIf you remember, once it went public last summer, that Newcastle United needed to bring in £50m+ before 30 June 2024, there was speculation that one or more key players could have to be sold. Bruno Guimaraes, Anthony Gordon, Alexander Isak…\nWith time running out for NUFC to sell one or more players to cover that £50m shortfall, it was becoming ever more fearful that United could lose one of our very best players.\nOn 26 June 2024, a media exclusive reported that Chelsea had made an approach to try and buy Alexander Isak.\nWho knows how far things got, if anywhere. However, I think what became apparent was that the Newcastle United hierarchy were preparing for all eventualities. That if they couldn’t sell less important players to cover the £50m+ shortfall, then they would have no alternative but to sell a very important player. Maybe a very very important player.\nIt was a huge mess that needed a very quick fix (Who at the club was responsible for letting it get to that stage…?).\nThe very messy quick fix was selling promising winger Yankuba Minteh to rivals Brighton for £33m, then also a PSR double deal with Forest who also had a shortfall to deal with. However, it shows just how desperate Newcastle were and how weak our position, that Forest got one of our most promising young players in Anderson for £35m, whilst Newcastle were forced to take a 30 year old goalkeeper they didn’t want and who still hasn’t started a competitive match a year later, plus Vlachodimos cost £20m in this double deal, despite Forest paying only £7m twelve months earlier and the keeper left permanently on the sidelines after only a handful of Premier League starts.\nIf Newcastle United were in such a desperate position to do those deals, especially the Anderson/Vlachodimos one, then what would have been the alternative if Forest and/or Brighton hadn’t been interested?\nFans were stunned at the time that two young promising players had been sold simply for PSR purposes and a £20m keeper signed that wasn’t wanted and would never start a game for NUFC.\nHowever, I don’t think it is much of a jump to think that without those deals happening, Alexander Isak could have potentially gone to Chelsea, or elsewhere, in June 2024.\nPlus, when you are in such a weak position and all these clubs know you need money desperately AND quickly, then demanding the highest possible transfer fee just isn’t reality.\nIn that sliding doors moment, I think we could have very possibly seen Alexander Isak sold for around £100m as Chelsea or another PL rival took advantage of Newcastle’s desperate need for very quick cash.\nImagine that had happened in June 2024, young squad players Anderson and Minteh not sold, Isak gone to Chelsea (or another club) for around £100m, probably a budget buy striker brought in to supplement the injury prone Wilson and the raw and inexperienced Osula,\nI think the net result would have been no trophy last season and no Champions League qualification.\nThe Newcastle United and Alexander Isak position now…\nIf you really believe in the need for Newcastle United to be clever sellers as well as clever buyers (lets hope we remember how to do that part as well very soon!), then Alexander Isak should be sold now.\nUnlike a year ago, Newcastle United are now in a very very strong position as potential sellers of Alexander Isak.\nNo PSR pressure whatsoever in terms of having to sell any player, so if any club wants any Newcastle United player, Alexander Isak or whoever, they will have to pay what NUFC want, unlike in June 2024. Also, Isak still has three years left on his current contract, so zero pressure on that front.\nAlexander Isak has been key to getting two Champions League qualifications in his three seasons, two Wembley appearances AND a trophy.\nWe couldn’t have done it without him BUT now is the time to sell I think.\nIf Liverpool, or another club, meet the Newcastle United asking price of £150m+, then for me it is now a no-brainer, once I got my head around the whole thing.\nAlexander Isak won’t ever have such a high value, in my opinion. Even another year’s time he would then be turning 27 in September 2026.\nIf say Newcastle received £150m for Isak, it would break the Premier League record paid by a PL team by around £35m, whilst only Neymar and Mbappe would have been more expensive in world football.\nNeymar had turned 25 a few months before joining PSG, whilst Mbappe was only 18. With Isak turning 27 in September 2026 I don’t think any way a club would be paying £150m+ next summer.\nNewcastle United would have serious extra cash and PSR flexibility if banking £150m+ this window for Alexander Isak.\nThat would massively help in releasing the current issues in getting the signings for various positions, though it would of course mean two strikers needing to be signed instead of one.\nIn no way would I ever turn on Alexander Isak as he has been a brilliant player these past three years. We couldn’t have achieved it without him, even with miracle worker Eddie Howe in charge.\nHowever, I think once you get the idea in the head that £150m+ might be a very good price to get for Alexander Isak now, I think it is then very easy to start thinking of other supporting evidence as to why this could be absolutely the right thing to do.\nI don’t think in any way Isak would down tools if staying, but at the very least he is going to be unhappy to a degree, if we accept he is interested in ‘exploring’ the possibility of moving this summer.\nI think it has been exaggerated the Alexander Isak injury problems during his time at Newcastle United but he has had recurring issues that means a number of games have been missed each of the three seasons.\nYou then have the impact on other players if say a deal was done on his contract, agree that Isak can leave next summer and in the meantime he gets a load more money. I just don’t think it works if you then get one of your top players getting a huge amount more than all of your other top players. No club sees every player paid the same, there will always be a huge gap between the lowest paid member of the squad and the very highest. However, very different when it is huge between the very top and second top (and others in the upper grouping).\nIn an ideal world I would have loved it for Alexander Isak to stay at St James’ Park until he retired.\nSadly, this is not an ideal world and Alexander Isak will leave Newcastle United and play elsewhere at some point. I believe that point is now, just so long as the buying club pays Newcastle’s asking price.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
