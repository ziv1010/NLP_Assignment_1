Videos show players swatting him away, and celebrating separately.\nPlayers said management was excessively controlling — and forced them to leave their hotel rooms unlocked\nMany of Las 15's complaints centered around longtime head coach Jorge Vilda, who the athletes allege fostered an environment that \"significantly\" impacted their physical and mental health in a negative manner.\nThey voiced concerns regarding the staff's tactical knowledge, the quality of training, and physical care provided to the players.\nThey also described the controlling nature of the team's management. Until 2019, members of the squad were required to leave their hotel rooms unlocked so the coaching staff could complete bed checks, The Athletic reported.\n\"We want a firm commitment towards a professional project in which all aspects are taken care of to get the best performances out of a group of players who we consider can achieve more and better objectives,\" the players later said in a group statement shared on Twitter.\nCoach Jorge Vilda (a nepo baby) called the complaints 'a farce'\nPlayers questioned Vilda's qualifications for the role of senior national team coach as they began their revolt.\nVilda's father, Ángel Vilda, is highly influential in Spanish soccer. While his influence on Jorge's career has never been confirmed, local media reports speculate that nepotism played a role in his ascent. (Ángel has denied helping his son.)\nMore in Sports\nThe younger Vilda rose up the coaching ranks fast. The Madrid native stepped into his first head coaching position with Spain's U-17 national team in 2009. In 2014, he assumed the helm for the U-19 side. Just one season later, in 2015, he was appointed to his current post.\nFast-forward to 2022, Vilda fiercely rejected his players' complaints. He refused to step down from his position at the front of the bench. In a fiery press conference just days after the emails went out, the 42-year-old called the situation \"a farce on the world stage.\"\n\"I don't wish what I'm going through these days on anyone,\" he added. \"You cannot throw the stone and hide your hand.\"\nPlayers faced a 5-year disqualification for voicing their complaints\nThough Las 15 insisted that they intended to keep the contents of their emails to the RFEF \"private,\" its president, Luis Rubiales, made a public response.\nThe federation wrote that it refused \"to accept any type of pressure from any player\" and called on the 15 athletes to \"ask for forgiveness\" if they wished to return to the national team.\nRubiales and company also threatened retribution against the participating players; their protest against the team's management style constituted a \"very serious infraction,\" their statement read, and could \"carry sanctions of two and five years of disqualification\" from La Roja.\nThe RFEF also unequivocally backed Vilda, accusing the players of questioning \"the continuity of the national team and its coaching staff\" in a way that \"is not within their powers.\"\nLas 15 includes some of the best players in the world\nSeven of the 15 players who took action against the federation came from FC Barcelona — the club that won this year's Champions League title in front of record-setting crowds. The rest are also widely regarded as top-class players.\nHere's the full list:\nFC Barcelona forwards Clàudia Pina and Mariona Caldentey\nFC Barcelona midfielders Aitana Bonmatí and Patri Guijarro\nFC Barcelona defenders Mapi León and Ona Batlle\nFC Barcelona goalkeeper Sandra Paños\nAtlético Madrid's Ainhoa Vicente and Lola Gallardo\nManchester City's Leila Ouahabi and Laia Aleixandri\nReal Sociedad's Nerea Eizagirre and Amaiur Sarriegi\nManchester United's Lucía García\nClub América's Andrea Pereira\nWhen it came to the World Cup, eight of these players declared themselves eligible for the World Cup. Vilda selected just three of them — Bonmati, Caldentey, and Batlle — leaving some of the world's best players out of the roster.\nSeven players refused to be considered, including León, who said: \"It will really piss me off not to go to the World Cup. But my values come first.\"\nSeveral US Women's National Team stars — who had their own feud with their federation over equal pay and treatment — spoke out in support of the Spanish players, too. Forward Megan Rapinoe said she's \"with the players 100%.\"\nSpain's natural talent is shining through at the World Cup\nSpain's success is a reflection of the immense talent, and depth, on the roster.\nThe squad has built-in chemistry, as the majority of his players have spent years competing together at the club level; eight members of the current World Cup squad play for Barcelona, while another eight play for Real Madrid.\nLaia Cervello Herrero, a Barcelona beat reporter, told Al Jazeera that may be masking Vilda's lack of tactical prowess. \"It is easier to take the skeleton of a winning team and transfer it to the national team,\" Herrero said. \"It gives you more guarantees.\"\nVilda claims the tumult within his ranks is behind them and that he now boasts \"great unity\" with his squad, as he said in a press conference after the semi-final.\nBut there are signs that the strain between the coach and his players remain, including this viral clip of Vilda celebrating solo following Spain's quarter-final win over the Netherlands:\nPassen d’ell, senzillament…🤷♂️ pic.twitter.com/Zug0Uh8CB9\n— Xavier 🇨🇦 (@barrademig) August 11, 2023\nA 2023 World Cup win could empower the players' movement — but it could also work against their protest\nSpain has never won the women's World Cup.\nIf they beat England on Sunday, each Spanish player gets $270,000 (pocket change for male soccer stars, but life-changing money for many women's players) plus the trophy.\nThere could be another prize: Some, including USWNT star Christen Press, argue that the players could gain more leverage over Vilda if they become world champions.\nBut there's also a reality in which the RFEF views an historic win as a testament to Vilda's skill, and further extends his tenure.\nSpain's championship match against England kicks off in Sydney Sunday at 6 a.m. ET (8 p.m. local time). Fans stateside can tune in to watch the action on FOX.\nRead the original article on Insider",
