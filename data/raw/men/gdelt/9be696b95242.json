  "body_text": "Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is in talks with AS Monaco over a summer move, as per reports.\nPogba has been searching for a new club to rejuvenate his career ever since Juventus and his representatives agreed to mutually terminate his contract in Turin.\nHe returned to Serie A in 2022 after leaving United upon the expiration of his contract at Old Trafford.\nHowever, his second stint at Juve suffered a major blow after he was handed a doping suspension in September 2023.\nPogba has been allowed to train since January and play competitive football since March. Accordingly, he is expected to join a new club ahead of next season.\nRecently, The Peoples Person relayed a report claiming the World Cup-winning midfielder has been offered to Monaco. Now, it seems the Principality side have shown serious interest in securing his services.\nAccording to Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio, talks between Pogba and Monaco are “progressing well”.\nESPN also suggest the 32-year-old is edging closer to a move to Ligue 1, claiming he is in “advanced talks” with Monaco over a free transfer.\nPogba has been linked with sides in the Saudi Pro League and the MLS but it appears he has prioritised staying in Europe. Monaco will feature in next season’s Champions League.\nPogba left French football as a 16-year-old in 2009, agreeing to swap Le Havre for United.\nEarly in the summer, Monaco also showed interest in ex-United goalkeeper David de Gea. However, Fiorentina are not expected to let the Spaniard depart this summer.\nIt would certainly have been interesting to see the ex-United pair reunite in France.\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
