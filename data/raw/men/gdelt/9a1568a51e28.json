We are going to grow and see where we end up.”\nAjax and AZ are both in action in European football on Thursday evening. Ajax meet Brighton away in their Europa League Group B fixture while AZ is at home to Aston Villa in the Conference League.\nThank you for donating to DutchNews.nl.\nWe could not provide the Dutch News service, and keep it free of charge, without the generous support of our readers.
