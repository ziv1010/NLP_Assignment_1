  "body_text": "from JEAN KASSONGO in Kinshasa, DRC\nDRC Bureau\nKINSHASA, (CAJ News) – THE 2025/26 CAF Champions League group stage provided a weekend of compelling action across Africa as clubs battled for crucial points with the quarter-final race intensifying ahead of the final matchday.\nIn Group A, a key encounter on Saturday 7 February saw Zambia’s Power Dynamos claim a valuable 2–0 victory over RSB Berkane of Morocco.\nThe double strike from Ronel Manyanga and late goal from Prince Mumba secured all three points for the Zambians.\nMeanwhile, on Sunday 8 February, Pyramids FC of Egypt continued their dominant campaign with a convincing 4–1 away win against Rivers United of Nigeria — a performance that underlined their status as Group A leaders.\nPyramids’ strong run has already booked them a place in the quarter-finals, sitting atop the group unbeaten, reaffirming their credentials after an impressive group stage.\nIn Group B, the weekend featured a stalemate between Algeria’s JS Kabylie and Egypt’s Al Ahly on Saturday, finishing 0–0.\nThat result was enough for the record 12-time African champions Al Ahly to claim qualification to the last eight, ending the day on nine points and topping the section.\nElsewhere in Group B on Saturday, AS FAR Rabat of Morocco narrowly edged past Tanzania’s Young Africans 1–0, with Anas Bach netting a decisive late goal.\nAlthough the win strengthens FAR’s position, the final standings could hinge on the last group fixtures.\nGroup C action brought closely contested matches too.\nOn Sunday, South Africa’s Mamelodi Sundowns drew 1–1 with St Eloi Lupopo of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), leaving both sides with work to do heading into the final round.\nMC Alger had earlier in the week beaten Al-Hilal Omdurman of Sudan 2–1, a result that kept the Algerians very much alive in the quarter-final hunt as the battle for the second automatic qualification spot remains finely poised.\nThe final group, Group D, saw Stade Malien of Mali secure an important 1–0 home win over Tunisian giants Espérance de Tunis, with Coulibaly scoring the decisive goal.\nThat victory placed Stade Malien in strong contention for a quarter-final berth — and indeed they officially confirmed their qualification following the weekend results.\nAcross the weekend, the competition’s narrative has been one of both expected progression and surprising twists. Pyramids FC and Al Ahly have already guaranteed their places in the quarter-finals, while Stade Malien have joined them after a superb weekend performance.\nMeanwhile, teams such as RS Berkane, Power Dynamos, AS FAR Rabat, MC Alger, and Espérance de Tunis remain in contention heading into the final matchday, with only a few points separating the pursuers in their respective groups.\nTeams like Mamelodi Sundowns and Al-Hilal Omdurman have work to do if they are to earn last-eight football.\nWith the race for the quarter-finals tighter than ever in some groups, African club football fans can expect dramatic conclusions next weekend as clubs chase continental glory.\n– CAJ News",
