  "body_text": "Real Madrid’s latest signing Franco Mastantuono spoke at his presentation in a press conference to explain that Los Blancos were not the only team who tried to sign him, with Paris Saint-Germain among those who showed an interest. He explained that, “well, yes, it’s true that many teams were interested in me, and I appreciate that and respect them. It’s very nice for me to have so much interest. I had the luck to be able to talk to Luis Enrique, he was very clear with me and I appreciated it and I’d like to congratulate him for the title last night. He has all my respect and thanks.”\nFranco Mastantuono: “Many teams were interested in me, I spoke to Luis Enrique”\nMastantuono on joining on his birthday\n“Thank you for the welcome. I’m very happy, it makes me happy in my body. I always had the dream of playing for Real Madrid, and especially on my birthday, so I’m very happy to have this dream come true.”\nMastantuono on the fans reaction to his transfer\n“I appreciate all the love I’ve had from the fans. When the talks began and then it became official, I was still at River and I was still focused on River. When I arrived in Madrid, my focus switched to this club, this huge club, and I’m very happy to be here.”\nMastantuono on how he’d describe how he plays\n“I’m an offensive player, left-footed, who almost always plays on the right. I don’t like to describe myself as a player very much, I prefer others to do it. But I will give my all to help the team and make fans feel that they can identify themselves with me.”\nMastantuono on why River Plate players do well at Real Madrid\n“My first dream as a player was to play at River and it came true. I was born there, it’s the biggest team in the Americas in my opinion. Many players have joined Real Madrid from River. I never had the pleasure of watching Di Stéfano, but my grandparents have told me about him, and he had a huge impact at Real Madrid and in football in the world, so it’s a great honour to be here.”“Xabi called me, it was very important for me that the coach showed so much belief in me. Obviously what we spoke about is private, but it gave me a lot of belief. It was my dream to play for Real Madrid and to happen like that, it meant a lot.”\nMastantuono on whether he spoke to Xabi Alonso\n“Xabi called me, it was very important for me that the coach showed so much belief in me. Obviously what we spoke about is private, but it gave me a lot of belief. It was my dream to play for Real Madrid and to happen like that, it meant a lot.”\nMastantuono on more Argentinians supporting Barcelona\n“Yes, Messi meant a lot to Barcelona and to Argentinians who have seen him play. In my opinion, Real Madrid is the biggest club in the world, history shows that. I’m here to make my own journey to make Real Madrid fans happy with what I can do on the field. That’s what I’m focused on.”\nMastantuono on the media focus on him\n“I’m calm, honest, just like always in my life. No-one has to lie, that’s what I will do and continue to do. I understand the publicity footballers get, especially at Real Madrid, just like at River in Argentina. It’s a part of the beautiful job that I get to do, so I will keep do what I’m doing.”\nMastantuono on his first Real Madrid memory\n“I grew up watching Real Madrid win many Champions League titles and winning a lot in Europe. It was incredible in those few years, that was my first memory. It was historic, I hope we can do more like that with me as a player like I watched when I was a boy.”\nMastantuono on how he feels\n“My dream is coming true. I didn’t imagine spending my birthday this way. It’s very beautiful. Coming to a club like Real Madrid, with as big as it is, is unique for any player.”\nMastantuono on whether he’s met any Real Madrid players and if he has a role model\n“My role model? I’ve had many. Real Madrid has incredible players every season. The players are here, and it’s very beautiful to be able to play alongside them and at the same club as so many historic players have been here. Today, I was here with Jude, I bumped into him doing the medical. He welcomed me marvellously. I admire him a lot, I watched him a lot from Argentina and I was very lucky to meet him and for him to welcome me.”\nMastantuono on whether he will be in the Argentina World Cup squad\n“I’m focused on right now. Obviously my objective is to be at the World Cup. I want to start training now with the first team tomorrow, have my head focused on that, and then think about the World Cup.”\nMastantuono on how he felt since signing until he could train\n“I was a bit anxious. I wanted to join the team. They’ve been some beautiful days, I didn’t know Madrid well so I could feel more comfortable and get to know it. Now I’m focused on what’s coming, which is training tomorrow.”\nMastantuono on what advice he’s had\n“I try not to look too much at my phone. Most of my people are here with me in person, I’m lucky. They help me to guide my journey. Many ex-team-mates, national team team-mates have congratulated me, and I’m grateful for that.”\nMastantuono on the number 30\n“I asked the president to wear the number 30. It’s a special number for me as I wore it at River. He accepted and let me, which makes me very excited to keep using that number.”\nMastantuono on whether he’s versatile with so many attacking options\n“I’m going to play where the coach decides. I’m here to help the team. I’m more accustomed to playing on the right, coming inside, but wherever I play, my plan is to connect with my team-mates and to do what the coach thinks is best for the team.”\nMastantuono on previous Argentinian players and the best player in the world\n“I watched all the Argentinian players who have been at Real Madrid, I’ve admired them all. I couldn’t see Alfredo Di Stéfano, but I could see Di María, Higuaín. For me the best player in the world is Messi. I’m Argentine, and in the last few years he’s been the best player in the world. I don’t have anything else to add.”\nMastantuono on adapting to European football\n“Well, let’s see in training tomorrow and then I’ll know better. I’m ready for that and I’ll do all I can to adapt to be able to compete as soon as possible.”\nMastantuono on his decision to focus on football, not tennis\n“The reality is that for three or four years I played in my dad’s football school, then tennis when I was older. It helped me to grow and I admire that sport. The decision, which wasn’t very difficult, came from River wanting to sign me to play for their youth team and I spoke to my family and they supported me in my dream to be a football player.”\nMastantuono on the challenges of playing in Europe\n“In Spain in particular, there’s a lot of positional and tactical play, and that can help me. The difficulty could be the rhythm and speed, which will be difficult to adjust to.”\nMastantuono on his next dream\n“We’re quick to have new dreams! My next dream is to wear the jersey and help the team in any way I can to win many titles, obviously with my club and the Argentine national team too. Those are my dreams.”\nMastantuono on the advice his family have given him\n“Real Madrid is a very big club, and the values they show are ones I admire and I will try to copy. My family are very happy when this became an option and when the deal was completed. I will try to enjoy this journey and I hope they can too.”",
