And while six wins in a row have reminded Klopp what his side are about, he wants some major surgery on his squad to propel them back to success.\nWorking alongside chief scouts Dave Fallows and Barry Hunter, Schmadtke is set to sign a three-year deal at Anfield.\nAnd the Daily Mail claims Schmadtke is ready to get to work straight away having been handed a list of four midfield targets.\nAnd per the report, they want three current Premier League stars to come in and strengthen their midfield.\nFirst up, the Reds are looking to sign Chelsea star Mason Mount in a deal that could top £50m. His deal at Chelsea expires next summer and there is a belief he can be lured away for the right price.\nIt will take a similar fee to prise Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton, who has enjoyed an excellent season. Liverpool, though, could reduce that by offering a much-loved star as part of a swap.\nLiverpool also want Nunes and Thuram\nThere is a clause in Mac Allister’s deal that will facilitate a sale, giving what should prove a simple task.\nMac Allister has scored 12 times this season and is seemingly emerging as Klopp’s No 1 target.\nSchmadtke will not stop there either, with another wedge of cash needed for their next two targets.\nIt will take another £44m fee to convince Wolves to part with Matheus Nunes, who the Mail claim is also on Klopp’s radar.\nThe Portuguese star was watched by Klopp prior to his move to Molineux, but he could be on the move again this summer.\nNext up, the paper claims Liverpool are also pushing to sign Khephren Thuram, the Nice midfielder.\nHe has been watched extensively by Liverpool scouts in recent weeks. And they are reportedly convinced the son of World Cup winner Lillian has what it takes to become a top midfielder.\nThe Ligue 1 side, though will not let him go cheaply, with a fee of £35m being mooted.\nIf Liverpool land all four targets, then they will need to part with an estimated £182m. But the quartet can help Liverpool return to trophy contention next season and also ensure Schmadtke’s reign gets off to a great start.\nREAD MORE: Gerrard talks up Liverpool move for ‘prime’ midfield target as Crouch lets slip Klopp transfer wish\nHUGO LLORIS OFFERED RIDICULOUS WAGES TO QUIT TOTTENHAM\nHugo Lloris looks set to hit the jackpot with the France goalkeeper offered a lucrative move away from Tottenham.\nThe 36-year-old is 11th season with Spurs, having signed in a bargain £11m move from Lyon in 2012.\nHowever, his form this season has fallen away with a series of mistakes creeping into his game. As such, there is a growing feeling around Spurs that Lloris is now past his best. Indeed, he has lost his place in the side with Fraser Forster being preferred in goal.\nAnd while he still has a year remaining on his deal, Tottenham will not stand in his way if an offer comes their way.\nLloris had been expected to wind his career down back in France. However, The Times claims Lloris is being offered a monster financial package to move to Saudi Arabia this summer.\nThe Middle East nation are on a major recruiment drive to bring in some of the game’s biggest stars. Cristiano Ronaldo plays for Al-Nassr, while Lionel Messi is a target for Al-Hilal.\nAnd while they do not name in question, a package is reportedly being put together worth £300,000 a week.\nTrebling his Tottenham wages, they claim the move is being given serious thought by the Frenchman.\nSpurs for their part will still seek a fee for Lloris, though that is unlikely to be too much.\nAnd in his place they are targeting a move for Inter Milan keeper Andre Onanan, though they face Chelsea competition.\nMAN CITY MAKE DECISION ON VILLA OFFER FOR KALVIN PHILLIPS\nAston Villa are likely to be hit with a ‘thanks, but no thanks’ reply to their bid to lure Kalvin Phillips to the club this summer.\nThe 27-year-old England star moved to Manchester City last summer in a £42m move from Leeds.\nHowever, his first season at the Etihad Stadium has not gone to plan. Indeed Phillips has just 17 appearances in all competitions to his name. That tots up to just a pitiful 405 minutes of action, with Phillips failing to dislodge the brilliant Rodri.\nAs a result, speculation is mounting that Phillips’ time at City could end after just a year.\nAnd reports of late claim Aston Villa are planning a fresh move for their long-term target.\nHowever, Unai Emery’s request to take Phillips from City will be met with a firm refusal, reports Football Insider.\nCiting sources, they indicate Pep Guardiola has no intention of letting Phillips leave. Furthermore, the 26-times capped England player also intends to fight for his place at City.\nHaving seen Jack Grealish struggle during his first year, Phillips will hope to take inspiration from his teammate.\nAs a result, Villa are reportedly set to turn their attention towards the capture of a PSG star instead.\nREAD MORE: Aston Villa can complete signing of the summer with PSG star available for shockingly low price",
