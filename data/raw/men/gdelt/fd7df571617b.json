  "body_text": "6 key takeaways from WSL gameweek 9\n- The final international break of the year concluded last week\n- WSL action returned over the weekend with some big results\n- Chelsea remain top of the standings after nine games\nWomen's Super League (WSL) action returned over the weekend with some big results at both ends of the table in the penultimate fixtures before the winter break.\nChelsea are cruising at the top of the standings, five points clear of the rest, while the battle for survival at the other ends of the table intensifies every single week. Manchester United got back to winning ways, Liverpool are feeling the pinch of injuries, and West Ham United got vital points.\nWith that being said, here are 90min’s six key takeaways from WSL gameweek nine…\nChelsea maintain 100% start\nAnother week, another win for Sonia Bompastor's Chelsea. Sjoeke Nusken scored a brace, while Aggie Beever-Jones and Johanna Rytting Kaneryd were also among the goals in the 4-2 victory at home to Brighton & Hove Albion.\nThings did get a little bit nervy when the visitors pulled it back to 3-2 with 20 minutes left to play, but the fourth Chelsea goal in stoppage time put the result beyond doubt. They have now won all nine of their WSL games this term, maintaining a 100% start to the league season.\nThey are five points clear at the top of the standings and, at this moment in time, they look untouchable. Their final game before the winter break will see them travel to face Leicester City, but one thing is certain: they will be top at Christmas.\nWest Ham clinch crucial win\nIt was shaping up to be a dismal afternoon for West Ham at home to Crystal Palace. With just over ten minutes gone, they were two goals down following strikes from Mille Gejl and Indiah-Paige Riley.\nHowever, a remarkable turnaround saw them go in at half time 3-2 up. Viviane Asseyi halved the deficit before Seraina Piubel put the Hammers back on level terms, and Manuela Pavi fired them in front on 44 minutes.\nSecond half goals from Anouk Denton and Katrina Gorry ensured the victory for Rehanne Skinner's side to take them up into eighth in the WSL standings after previously failing to win any of their first seven games. This victory was equally as remarkable as it was crucial given the way they started the game, and West Ham will be brimming with confidence ahead of this week's trip to Villa Park.\nTop three race heats up\nChelsea are runaway leaders at the top of the WSL at this stage – although Manchester City will back themselves to claw their way into contention. But, both Manchester United and Arsenal are now within touching distance of second place as well.\nAll three recorded comfortable 4-0 victories in their respective games over the weekend, which has only served to intensify the race for the top three and Champions League qualification. Arsenal and United are level on 18 points with City not too far ahead on 22.\nDespite Sunday's defeat to Chelsea, Brighton are also clinging to that European conversation as they sit on 16 points after nine games. While keeping the pace into the latter stages of the campaign is a tall order, it's not beyond the realms of possibility that they will stay in the mix.\nInjuries bite for Liverpool\nLiverpool could only name 16 players in the matchday squad for the short trip to face Manchester United, such is the injury crisis that has dominated their season so far. The Reds cancelled a pre-season game against United due to injuries and the situation hasn't really improved, with key midfielder Marie Hobinger the latest to fall victim during the international break.\nLucy Parry, Sophie Roman Haug, Sofie Lundgaard, Racheal Laws, Hannah Silcock and Gemma Evans were all also missing on Sunday, ruled out for varying lengths of time. It has opened the first-team door for impressive teenager Zara Shaw, while Maddy Duffy made her debut against United. But it is consolation given the overall impact a lack of senior players is having on results.\nLiverpool beat United home and away in the WSL last season. But while they initially competed well in this one, conceding twice in quick succession half and hour in killed them en-route to losing 4-0.\nBethany England seizes the moment for Spurs\nTottenham Hotspur leapfrogged Liverpool in the table with a narrow 2-1 triumph at Everton over the weekend. Robert Vilahamn's side initially took the lead courtesy of a Bethany England goal, but that was quickly cancelled out by a strike from Toffees midfielder Sara Holmgaard.\nSpurs were awarded a penalty early in the second half and England calmly stepped up to restore the host's lead at Brisbane Road. The Lilywhites were then able to hold on to their slender advantage to move up to sixth, a point clear of Liverpool in the standings.\nRelegation battle intensifies\nTypically in the WSL, there is a small number of teams battling it out at the bottom of the table and there is usually a firm favourite to go down. This time around, that is far from the case.\nLeicester and Crystal Palace sit on five points each, Everton and Aston Villa on six, West Ham on eight, Liverpool on nine and Spurs on 10. Just five points currently separate 12th from the top half.\nOn current form, any one of those teams could realistically get relegated this season. It will make for an exciting, drama-filled end to the campaign, but extremely stressful for those battling to survive.",
