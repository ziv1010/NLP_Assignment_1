  "body_text": "Bayern Munich’s Hiroki Ito is set for another spell on the sidelines after suffering a metatarsal fracture for the second time this season.\nThe Japanese defender picked up the injury in Bayern’s 3-2 win over St Pauli on Saturday. He came on as a substitute in the 58th minute and was forced off injured just over half an hour later. Bayern played the final stages of the game with only 10 players, having already used all five substitutions.\nAdvertisement\nIt is another blow to head coach Vincent Kompany after injuries to defenders Alphonso Davies and Dayot Upamecano.\nIto joined Bayern on a four-year deal in the summer from fellow Bundesliga side Stuttgart but sustained a metatarsal fracture in preseason. He underwent surgery twice and did not make his debut for the side until February 12 in a 2-1 in the Champions League play-off round.\n“The news of another serious injury to Hiroki hits us all very hard,” said Max Eberl, Bayern Board member for sport. “He’s only just battled back after months of rehab and will now be out for a long time again – we can barely imagine how he’s feeling. He’ll get all the support he needs from us. He’s a fighter and we look forward to him being back on the pitch.”\nIto has only featured in eight matches at club level this season, totaling only 282 minutes. He is set to miss an important part of Bayern’s season, which includes a Champions League quarter-final tie against Inter.\nThe 26-year-old has 21 senior caps for Japan and was part of the squad that became the first nation outside of the three host countries to qualify for the 2026 World Cup in March’s international break.\nBayern lead the Bundesliga by six points from second-placed Bayer Leverkusen. Kompany’s side return to action on Friday when they visit Augsburg.\nAn outright disaster for Bayern\nAnalysis from German football correspondent Sebastian Stafford-Bloor\nHaving only just returned from months out, this will be devastating on a personal level for Ito, given how he has shown his value over the last few weeks and slowly recovered his form and fitness.\nBut from Bayern’s perspective, this is an outright disaster. Upamecano is facing several weeks out already, potentially longer, and Davies will not play again this season.\nIto’s ability to provide cover in both positions had softened the blow of those injuries. Without him now unavailable too, this has turned into a crippling defensive crisis.\nAdvertisement\nAhead of the Champions League tie with Inter Milan, Kompany now only has two available centre-backs, in Kim Min-jae and Eric Dier, and one senior left-back, in Raphael Guerreiro, who is not as defensively secure as Ito and has a very different set of abilities.\nAt a push, Sascha Boey could offer support in that role too, but he is much more comfortable on the right side and typically looks vulnerable on the left — as he did against Bayer Leverkusen in that disastrous game at the BayArena last season. Boey is likely to leave the club at the end of the season and is out of favour for a reason.\nGiven their resources, nobody will shed a tear for Bayern domestically, but with a new injury seemingly appearing every week, their task in Europe is getting tougher and tougher.\n(Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images)",
