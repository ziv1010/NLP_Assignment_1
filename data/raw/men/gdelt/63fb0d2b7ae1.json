  "body_text": "Fernandinho interrupts my flow — something he was always pretty always special at for Manchester City. I’m trying to prise out details about working under Pep Guardiola and the demands he places on his players, but I’d become lost in clauses and sub-clauses, making things complicated about a manager whose genius is to make the game look so beautiful, so free and fluent and easy…\n“Let me ask you something: how many goals did you score in your career?” he says, flying out of nowhere, and I hesitate deliberately, as if every single one of them isn’t seared on my soul. “In the Premier League… 260,” I say, umming and ahhing, playing it cool, “but a few others in the cups. About 400 (it’s actually 283 in league football and 409 in total for club and country, but hey, I’m totally relaxed about it and who’s counting anyway).”\nAdvertisement\n“I’m sure if you had Pep as your manager, you would score even more — double or triple that,” Fernandinho says and now I’m trying not to drool as I do the maths in my head and the awestruck admiration I’ve felt towards Erling Haaland this season is morphing into something closer to outright jealousy.\n“Pep makes you understand that football is more simple than you think. He’s got the power to convince you, to show you, to prove to you on a daily basis in training sessions, in meetings, and especially during games, that everything he’s telling you is going to happen.\n“Obviously, it’s a different era to when you played and the amount of information a footballer has today is huge. Before you go to a game with City, you know everything about your opponent — everything. In your case, as a striker, you’d know exactly the movements the defenders are used to making, if they have a deficiency on the left or right side, or in covering a big space, if they’re good in the air, using their body or on the ground.\n“After a conversation or meeting or training session with Pep, you have all this information and know exactly how to use it. He shows you the way to improve yourself, to be a better version of yourself. I’ve always said I’m the living proof that everything people say about him is true. I first met him when I was 30, I worked with him for seven years and he helped me improve my technical, tactical and physical skills.\n“The way I see football now… I’d never, ever seen it like that before I met him. That’s why he’s considered one of the greatest managers of all time and that’s why he’s a hunter of titles. He’s 100 per cent focused on his job, on his work, on extracting a better version of his players every day. If there’s something he thinks you’re capable of doing, he’s going to tell you, he’s going teach you, he’s going to convince you until you do it. He’s really, really special.”\nI’m fascinated by that concept of making the game simple and what that actually means.\nAdvertisement\n“Coming from a country like Brazil, the first thing they tell young players they have to do is dribble past two or three players, to make the difference in that way,” Fernandinho says.\n“With Pep, it’s different. When someone has the ball, you have to help them: play short passes, move, keep the ball at the right time, pass the ball in the right moment, try to occupy space and try to find the player behind the lines.\n“If you take the first goal against Real Madrid (in the Champions League semi-final second leg), the simple pass Kevin (De Bruyne) gave to Bernardo (Silva) and the way he controlled the ball and finished, it was simple football but very effective. When you talk about simple, it’s seeing your team-mate on the pitch and passing the ball in a way he can control it properly to finish the action. That’s the definition of playing simple.”\nAfter our chat, which takes place over Zoom — him in Brazil, me in Newcastle — I feel like I have a better understanding of City and Pep, and I certainly know more about Fernandinho. I’m not sure what I was expecting of this wonderful, versatile (and hard as nails) footballer, who won five Premier League titles at the Etihad Stadium, captaining the team to two of them, but he is engaging, articulate and just so bloody nice.\nCity have two matches left this season. Lift the FA Cup against Manchester United this weekend and they are double winners. Lift the Champions League trophy against Inter Milan and they are immortals. Off the pitch, 115 charges for alleged breaches of the Premier League’s financial rules hang over them, but on it, there are no qualifications or asterisks; they are joyous and relentless and exhilarating.\nFernandinho played a huge part in that journey, joining City in 2013 and staying until last summer when he returned to Athletico Paranaense, where he began his career. One of the first things I notice as we talk? City are still “we” and “us”.\nAdvertisement\nThere is a big smile when I point it out. “Yeah,” he says. “I don’t know if it’s because I’m still in contact with most of the people and I’m following Manchester City every time I can. Obviously, I’m working here in Brazil, but I watch most of the games and I still text the players and staff and the people who work behind the scenes — they are just as important as the team, the coaches, the sporting directors.\n“When they reached the Champions League final and they won the league, we texted each other. We made some phone calls, video calls and I congratulated them. It’s important to keep those contacts because I have a really big appreciation for what they have done now and also for the respect they have for me and the respect we built together over the years.\n“I’m still feeling part of the process and I’m feeling part of the team and part of those group of people because they are amazing. I’m really proud to be part of this amazing club and this amazing project.”\nWhich I suppose begs the question of why Fernandinho left in the first place, although at 37 — he is 38 now — perhaps it is not so surprising. It’s just that he was so integral for so long; it must have been a wrench to let go. When he first appears on our call, resplendent in his training gear, he says, “I really appreciate you remembering me,” which kind of sums him up. Remember him? Jesus, after everything he’s done… He’s a legend.\n“It’s been good since I came back,” he says. “It’s really busy here — the schedule is quite similar to the Premier League, but I’m enjoying it and I’m so happy to be home, playing alongside my mates and for my family. My kids are learning some Brazilian culture (Davi, his son, was born in Ukraine — when Fernandinho played for Shakhtar Donetsk — and Mariana, his daughter, followed in 2017, during his spell in England). It’s a new life, but it’s good.”\nConfirmed at a Champions League press conference last April, Fernandinho’s decision to leave appeared to catch Pep on the hop. “It was a little bit of misunderstanding because I’d been giving some signals that I would go back to Brazil but I didn’t speak to him openly,” he says now. “In that interview, the journalist was asking me if I would like to extend my contract with Man City and my answer was, ‘I don’t think so’.\n“I understood that my time at City should come to an end, that I wanted to finish my career playing football, that if I stayed there I would be playing fewer minutes than I’m playing now. That’s why I took the decision and I’m happy with that. I’ve played a lot of games. Our season here starts in January and I have played about 30 games already. I wanted to prove myself again, to help our young players grow and to make them understand how to play at a high level.”\nI ask how long he will go on for.\nAdvertisement\n“For as long as my mind allows me to,” he says. “The physical part is really important, but I’ve always believed that your mind controls everything and as long as I’m happy and motivated to go to the training centre every morning, to face those challenges you have in football, then I will play. It could be 39, 40, 41 — I don’t know yet.\n“As soon as I decide it’s going to be my last training session, my last game, I will sit down with my family and we will decide together about the next chapter of our lives. It’s going to be maybe six months or one year’s pause to study, to learn things because, for the next challenge, I just want to be really ready. It could be as a sporting director or someone who can work in clubs trying to improve young talent.”\nSo he doesn’t see himself taking the Vincent Kompany or Mikel Arteta route, former City players and staff now excelling as managers?\n“I’m not sure about coaching, about being the one who is going to wear the suit and tie on the side of the pitch,” he says. “But I could be someone who tries to improve players, to speak to them, helping them out in the best way possible to be better players, better people. I don’t see myself as a proper manager like we see with Vinny, but working alongside coaches.”\nSee what I mean about him? He’s thoughtful, different, open to new ideas. You can see why he thrived under Guardiola, a brilliant manager but one who stretches his players. Look at John Stones, a centre-back, stepping into midfield this season. Look at those inverted full-backs. Look at the way they’ve adapted to Haaland’s presence.\n“The difference now with Haaland playing is you can assume a little bit more risk to play forward,” he says. “When I was there, we tried to keep the ball as much as we could, not to lose it, because we didn’t have this kind of player up front. Obviously, we had Kun (Sergio Aguero), we had Gabi (Gabriel Jesus), but they are different players with different qualities.\n“In recent games when Pep put four central defenders to play in the back-four, I think this can make it more solid for the players in the middle or up front — they can take more risks because the back four, they are really defenders.\nAdvertisement\n“Kevin (De Bruyne) has always made a lot of assists, but with that back-four so solid behind him he can try even more. And with Erling’s presence in the box, his speed, his size, his opponents are going to be shaking. He can score goals running behind defenders, he can score goals with headers. He’s almost the complete striker. I think this makes Manchester City’s lives better and much easier.”\nThis tactical flexibility is nothing new; Fernandinho did all of that and more, swapping positions and being outstanding in all of them.\n“Back in the day — I think it was in 2016-17, Pep’s first season — I used to play as a full-back, right and left,” he says. “After that, I played as an attacking midfielder and a holding midfielder. And then in 2019-20, I played as a central defender, playing left or right. It helped me a lot, to understand the needs of my team-mates during the game, the situations they face. Knowing the demands of playing in those positions helped me understand tactics.\n“Yaya (Toure) used to say, ‘There are two things you need to play for Pep Guardiola. You need to speak at least three languages and you have to be able to play in at least three different positions. Understand that and you are one or two steps ahead of everyone else’…”\nNow it’s my turn to interrupt. Three languages? I can do Geordie and I can just about scrape by in English… And three positions? That would be me completely f*****…\nHe laughs. “In every case, you can have one exception, OK?” he says. “You can have one special player.”\nI can feel my chest puffing out. Have I mentioned that I really, really like this guy?\nHe carries on. “But those things are important because sometimes Pep needs to change formation during games without changing players. Sometimes he used to attack in one shape and then defend in another. So if you have a player like John (Stones), who can play as a midfielder, or a full-back or centre-back, it really helps. And it helps the manager to trust those players. John has been amazing.”\nAdvertisement\nCity have been rampant since late February, winning 18 of their 22 games in all competitions since then and losing only once, a meaningless defeat at Brentford. I wonder, though, what Fernandinho made of that moment in the Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid when Pep was shouting at De Bruyne to pass the ball and the Belgium international appeared to tell his manager to “shut up”? Pep giggled about it afterwards and said he “loved it” but did those frustrations boil over often?\n“This kind of situation which happened to Kevin and Pep on the sideline is normal,” he says. “Obviously, you don’t see it too much during the game, but during training sessions sometimes it’s needed. It is necessary to happen, those situations. With the new generation, you have to be careful because if you shout at them so much, some players can’t play the way we expect and they can drop.\n“Kevin is different and, as much as you challenge him, he will grow, he will improve, he will play better — and Pep knows it. That is the importance of knowing your players and their characters, to know how to deal with some situations, especially playing Champion League semi-finals, and how to handle those kind of pressures. I’m so glad when something like that happened, the team won. After that you are mates — friends again — and life continues.\n“We always used to say that when you are inside the training ground or the stadium, you are 100 per cent focused, to improve, to get better. Sometimes you have to grab players on the top of the t-shirt and make them do what you have to do. With some players, you have to speak to them a bit nice or kind. Other players, you have to challenge them and speak to them really, really aggressively. Sometimes this is necessary to win titles and to make history.”\nIn any case, when the stakes are so high, intensity and creative tension are understandable and City and the Champions League has long since been a beautiful obsession.\n“It’s an obsession for the players first of all because we all grew up watching the competition,” Fernandinho counters. “You always knew the best players won it and the prestige you have to be in this tournament is huge. But yeah, for City to be understood as one of the greatest clubs or teams in the world, you have to win it. That’s why it was always one of the goals, the targets. And everyone there believes City can win it.”\nLosing the final to Chelsea in 2021 was tough to take, but Fernandinho now views that as a building block. “It was frustrating for everyone because we had the chance to win, especially against an opponent we played domestically and knew well: their qualities and their weaknesses. This kind of game depends on how you are that day — you can make wrong decisions in one action and it’s going to cost you the game, but I don’t think we had the experience to win then.\n“None of us had the experience of playing in a Champions League final for City and I would say that some of us felt it. I think this year will be different because we went through those difficult moments: we lost the final, we lost in the semi-final the next year. And not just Pep but everyone else will be ready for the situations you may face during the game. That’s why I’m really confident we’ll win it.”\nAnd, depending on what happens at Wembley first, that could mean the treble.\nAdvertisement\n“We always used to say ‘careful’,” he says. “We think differently from the fans. They are really excited about that, especially facing Manchester United in the FA Cup final after how many years City had been in their shadow, being the second team in the city…”\nDid Manchester United’s own treble in 1999 ever filter into the City consciousness — was it something they thought about and wanted to emulate?\nFernandinho hesitates. “They were not the Manchester United they used to be before and the highest they finished was second behind us,” he says. “Listen to the fans, listen to the press and you understand they were much better in the past. They got a lot of titles, they had a great team in 1999 and a great manager, but in the last 10 years, they were behind us. This is the reality now.\n“Manchester United is a local derby, but in terms of performance, the biggest challenge we faced was Liverpool. They were a better team and they pushed us in the Premier League. The games we played against them were at a really high level. This year City have a chance to win the treble but, as a City fan, you always have to be very careful. You always understand where you come from.”\nThere has been a big focus on game management this season, with Newcastle United, my old club, attracting attention for it. After so many years of being meek and passive, I’ve loved the aggression (and quality) of Eddie Howe’s team and their refusal to take any shit, but there’s also been a lot of nonsense spouted. Every team does it, big or small, and City know when to foul at the right time, when to break up play. Fernandinho was a master of it.\nHe laughs again. “Yeah, it’s part of the game,” he says. “You know, if you are allowed to make fouls, why don’t you use that? Playing in a team which has a lot of attacking players, you sometimes see yourself alone in the middle of the pitch — and if that’s the only chance you have to stop (opponents), you have to use it. It wasn’t often, because most of the time I used to recover the ball really cleanly. But it was important because it helped my team-mates play better football.”\nTalking of Newcastle, Eddie has nurtured a siege mentality. Perhaps there’s a link there to the club’s takeover and the controversy that followed it — they are 80 per cent owned by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund — but it’s also a reflection of our identity. It’s similar with City; they were outsiders and then disruptors, too, with their fans booing the Champions League anthem. There were UEFA charges and now there are Premier League charges.\nAdvertisement\nDid players think about that? Did they worry about it? Was there a sense of “us against the world” in the dressing room?\n“I think Manchester City are still that way,” Fernandinho says. “But as players, we never paid attention to that, letting it distract us from our goals or our targets, because we wanted to improve and to do our best on the pitch. But it’s not easy to be in this position.\n“And, by the way, for me Newcastle, Man City, Brighton and Arsenal were the best teams by far this season in terms of playing this kind of football, you know, and it’s been really joyful to watch them play. It’s really nice to see Newcastle qualifying for the Champions League after 20 years.”\nAmen to that.\nHow can he not miss it, I ask, the raging waves of City’s football, the success, the glory, the poetry of Pep’s simplicity, the rain, the Premier League, the pressure and potency, living on the edge, two games away from legend…\n“To be fair,” he says, another smile spreading, “I’m living in a city called Curitiba and the weather is very similar to Manchester. But yeah, I think about the friendships we made and built through the years and the environment we created. It was really important for me and everyone who was involved. I think the stage the club is at now is because we made something incredible in the past, something really, really solid.\n“The quality and the high level of football being played in the Premier League is unique. You cannot find it anywhere. But it’s the people I miss most: the players, the coaches, all the people who worked at Man City, even the way the press covered the games, the respect they showed when they analysed games. Hopefully, I can come back to Manchester to visit my team-mates, to celebrate and have fun together.”\n(Photo: Visionhaus/Getty Images)",
