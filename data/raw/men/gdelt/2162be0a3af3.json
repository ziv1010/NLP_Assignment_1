If it weren't for Germany gaining an extra place via this season's coefficient battle, BVB would not have been assured of a spot in next season's Champions League.\nDortmund teams of yesteryear - even the less successful ones - brought with them a bit more star power and identity. Edin Terzic's troops aren't short in either department, but they don't have the ability to go toe-to-toe with this all-conquering Madrid side. They'll need the performance of their lives to win at Wembley.\nBallon d'Or winners in waiting\nThe Galacticos era is back in full swing at the Santiago Bernabeu.\nFlorentino Perez and co have successfully built a team to challenge for top honours for the rest of the decade and beyond.\nLeading Los Blancos' charge are Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham, the latter of whom was named La Liga's Player of the Season earlier this week.\nTogether, they have recorded a combined 46 goals and 23 assists this season. With this year's Ballon d'Or very much up for grabs, it's increasingly likely it will be handed to one of them.\nDortmund's self-implosion\nWhen's the best time to criticise your manager's tactics and club's paradoxical philosophy? Why, days before the Champions League final, of course!\nDortmund legend Mats Hummels didn't hold back in an interview with BILD this week, aiming a sly dig at Terzic for some of the team's performances this year.\n\"I was furious because I felt that Borussia Dortmund should never perform like that - against any opponent in the world. I felt it couldn't go on like this. I felt humiliated to stand on the pitch in this jersey, so submissive, so football-wise inferior,\" he said.\n\"The two Stuttgart games, and also the away game in Leverkusen, were about barricading with 11 men in the penalty area.\"\nHow's that squad harmony, lads?\nHistory\nThere is not a weight of expectation that comes with wearing the white of Real Madrid, but an empowering confidence. They are the Champions League's club, and when they get to this stage in the modern era, there's only ever one outcome.\nMadrid have been to 17 finals, winning 14 of them - including a current streak of eight in a row. By contrast, Dortmund have only played in two and their most recent outing in this fixture saw them beaten at Wembley by rivals Bayern back in 2013.\nThe on-field and off-field battles both heavily favour Madrid - Dortmund winning would be one of the greatest shocks in sporting history.",
