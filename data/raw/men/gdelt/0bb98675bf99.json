  "body_text": "After one of the most controversial endings to a postseason game and a suspension-earning press conference, the Minnesota Lynx and Phoenix Mercury face off once more for Game 4 of their NBA Semifinals series on Sunday, Sept. 28 at PHX Arena in Phoenix.\nThe game is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. EDT and will be broadcast on ESPN and ESPN Deportes.

Additionally, those with DirecTV, FuboTV or Hulu + Live TV can access ESPN Unlimited through their package.\nThe Mercury lead the series 2-1 after an 84-76 Game 3 victory. However, Game 3 will forever be remembered for one of its final plays when Lynx forward Napheesa Collier was looking to cut into an 80-76 Phoenix lead with less than 30 seconds remaining. Collier went to turn the corner on Mercury forward and fellow MVP finalist Alyssa Thomas, but Thomas poked the ball free, and in the immediate aftermath of the loose ball, Collier and Thomas bumped knees and Collier then injured her ankle as Thomas took the steal to the other end for an easy layup.\nFrom there, the story becomes about Minnesota coach Cheryl Reeve, who came onto the court to argue with officials over the no-call, and then got a technical foul. But it didn’t stop there, as Reeve then called out the WNBA for issues she and others across the league have complained about all season. However, Reeve’s comments went too far according to the league, and she is suspended for Game 4.\nWithout their coach or their star player who is out with an ankle injury, the Lynx, who have been the top team in the league all season, are now playing to force a series-deciding Game 5 against a Phoenix team that has won four of its last five games after staving off elimination against last year’s champions the New York Liberty.\nWho: Minnesota Lynx vs. Phoenix Mercury\nWhen: Sunday, Sept. 28 at 8 p.m. EDT\nWhere: PHX Arena in Phoenix\nStream: FuboTV; Sling; DIRECTV (free trial); ESPN\nBetting: Check out our MA sports betting guide, where you can learn basic terminology, definitions and how to read odds for those interested in learning how to bet in Massachusetts.\nWhat is DIRECTV?\nDIRECTV is an internet TV service that offers your favorite entertainment, news and sports channels, as well as local TV stations and regional sports networks.
