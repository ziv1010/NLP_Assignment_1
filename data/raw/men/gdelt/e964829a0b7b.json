Sky Italia are also claiming that a deal is close.\nThe Blues have been linked with Gnonto since the end of last season following the Yorkshire club's relegation from the Premier League.\nThe 19-year-old was one of Leeds's standout performers in an otherwise miserable season and it was expected that he would leave Elland Road this summer.\nAston Villa have been credited with keen interest in Gnonto who scored 4 goals in 28 games in all competitions last season after capturing national attention with a brilliant strike in an FA Cup tie against Cardiff City.\nArticle continues below video content\nHowever, Sport Italia maintain that the Villans have not made their move, leaving the way clear for Everton to swoop for £18.8m.\nThat was swiftly been played down by sources closer to Leeds who suggest that Villa remain the more likely destination for Gnonto and that there is no deal in place with Everton. However, late on Friday night, 14th July, Sky Italia weighed in saying that the Toffees are \"getting ever closer\" to acquiring the player.\nReader Comments (210)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

However, at least we made our money back on him\nI don't hate the idea of this move but we need 2 strikers more. Would have preferred a winger that can play up top too\nBut if we got him it's a pretty positive move overall\n3 Posted 11/07/2023 at 08:25:14\n4 Posted 11/07/2023 at 08:26:20\n5 Posted 11/07/2023 at 08:33:12\n6 Posted 11/07/2023 at 08:36:38\nWhat is not to love, the first piece in the jigsaw. Get ready for some fast counter attacking football!\n7 Posted 11/07/2023 at 08:40:48\n8 Posted 11/07/2023 at 08:51:24\n9 Posted 11/07/2023 at 09:11:07\nA starter in my view with lots of potential.\n10 Posted 11/07/2023 at 09:19:25\nHe may be a young exciting prospect,but who's going to knock the goals in?\n11 Posted 11/07/2023 at 09:54:23\nI'm not sure he'd be my top pick but the lad has undoubted talent and I think will go on to be a better player than Demarai Gray.\nWhat annoys me though is potentially paying £20m for someone we could have got 12 months ago for £4m.\nWe really need to start picking these talents up earlier rather than when their price has quadrupled after one decent season in a top league! Caciedo, Sangare and Gnonto are all players who I pointed out on this site before they moved (along with others who've not done so well). We could have got that trio for around £12m and they'd be worth around ten times that now.\n12 Posted 11/07/2023 at 09:55:05\nHe sounds versatile ;\n“â€ Gnonto is an attacker who is capable of playing in various roles across the frontline.\nThe teenager considers his best position to be as a support striker in a front two, where he is utilised for club side FC Zurich\nBut he has also shown himself to be just as comfortable on both the right and left wing of a 4-3-3, which is where he played for Italy in June's international matches.â€\nThis signing may point to a more journeyman type centre forward being signed for little money or on loan. Che Adams, Weghorst etc as back up to Calvert-Lewin.\n13 Posted 11/07/2023 at 09:59:05\n14 Posted 11/07/2023 at 10:08:05\nMore like 20 yearsâ€¦\n16 Posted 11/07/2023 at 10:14:36\nWas hit and miss in his first season last year, but now defenders will have worked him out.\nYes small and fast but can't cross a ball, can't pick out a pass and doesn't score many.\nSurely we should be looking at cover for big Dom first.\n17 Posted 11/07/2023 at 10:17:51\n18 Posted 11/07/2023 at 10:28:36\nNo point in having wingers when we don't have strikers.\n19 Posted 11/07/2023 at 10:41:31\nIf we can get a proven goalscorer in as well I'd feel a lot less anxious anout the coming season and DCL's part in it.\n20 Posted 11/07/2023 at 10:43:41\n21 Posted 11/07/2023 at 11:02:24\nWe have wingers already at the club. We don't have strikers.\n22 Posted 11/07/2023 at 11:04:57\nSome posters were lauding Fat Sam as the man who would save Leeds and relegate Everton. Instead, he removed their attacking threat, went route one, got them relegated, blamed the team and then left.\nGnonto is right footed but can also play on the left - he is versatile.\n23 Posted 11/07/2023 at 11:08:51\nI also agree with comments on this thread about the pathetic, unproductive scouting system : Everton have been behind the curve for years, it is plainly obvious.\n24 Posted 11/07/2023 at 11:11:22\n25 Posted 11/07/2023 at 11:14:19\n26 Posted 11/07/2023 at 11:16:41\nJust need to make sure Calvert-Lewin doesn't go for a yodel in Switzerland. Now, how much did we need to knock off the P&S debt to get down to minus £105M?\n27 Posted 11/07/2023 at 11:21:25\n28 Posted 11/07/2023 at 11:25:05\nSounds a bit like the rumour that went around when we signed Cottee, that they couldn't be any taller or they'd ruin the team photo. Or is it a cunning ploy to make Maupay look taller?\n29 Posted 11/07/2023 at 11:25:14\n30 Posted 11/07/2023 at 11:27:28\nWhat we have as we all know is very iffy with Calvert-Lewin seemingly an eternal sick note and very little else to turn to as Simms didn't fit the bill. Maupay is a bust and Gray is dangerous but not often enough.\nWe cannot afford to bid with the money clubs for the elite strikers and so we have to hope that a no-name cheapie might produce the goods.\n31 Posted 11/07/2023 at 11:42:47\nI still believe that we'll have to lose one major player prior to the end of this window, in order to purchase any significant additions. I tried to understand what Dave Powell has written, but this P&S stuff is beyond my limited brain capacity. What I do know, is that Evertonians are in for another bumpy ride in the coming season.\nEverton profit and sustainability position explained as new signings yet to arrive\n33 Posted 11/07/2023 at 11:52:14\nIs he here to replace Iwobi, who is still to sign a new contract? We cannot afford to let him leave on a free come July 2024.\nAs for the centre-forward, I reckon we will go Dutch, adding a bit more claret to the mix.\n34 Posted 11/07/2023 at 12:07:40\nI'm not hugely fussed about Gnonto, if I'm honest. He possibly has the stupidest (funniest?) song going (check YouTube) but he's also very much got his pros and cons and doesn't look especially good value.\nBut if we got, say, him and Piroe we would be much stronger in attack next season which is probably the main thing (although that might be offset by the departure of Gray who might not be amazing but has done a really good job for us).\n35 Posted 11/07/2023 at 12:09:45\nHis career trajectory is on the way up and it's tough to see a negative here. The height thing is nonsense too by the way, see Raheem Sterling.\n36 Posted 11/07/2023 at 12:22:40\nWe did the same with Onana â€“ he went to Lille for £7m, one year later we sign him for £33M. Why can't we spot these players for £7M?\nAnd out of all the full-backs in the world in different leagues â€“ is Ashley Young really the best our scouting team can come up with?\n37 Posted 11/07/2023 at 12:30:14\nGnonto plays mainly on the left and likes to cut in, I think personally he is Gray's replacement who is going to Saudi maybe? If we can pull a hefty fee (given that we brought him for buttons) that covers most of this purchase I would think that as excellent business.\nFor anyone knocking Gnonto, remember he is a full international at 19, he is going to get a lot better. Would be a coup for us.\n38 Posted 11/07/2023 at 12:37:50\nIt seems a lot of money to be paying out for Gnonto but if true, I suppose Dyche and Thelwell see something in him. (I hope so !)\nI'd have thought that any big(ish) spend would have gone on goalscorer though. Do you reckon Piroe could be the goalscorer we need, Robert?\n39 Posted 11/07/2023 at 12:50:01\nSurely we need more of a target-man vibe? Am presuming that Gyokeres or Bilal Toure were first picks. Wonder who is next on the list?\n40 Posted 11/07/2023 at 13:08:16\nA good player who puts in a shift and gets as many goals as Gray. Unless the injury was worse than what they say it was, or was he on large wages?\nJust seemed daft to let him go.\n41 Posted 11/07/2023 at 13:22:15\n42 Posted 11/07/2023 at 13:23:54\nThat's actually smart business by us...astoundingly so!!\n43 Posted 11/07/2023 at 13:47:33\n44 Posted 11/07/2023 at 13:59:05\nI think that he will end up with Villa, Leeds are not desperate to offload the player and he has a fairly long contract without a relegation clause, it will be ultimately down to the player who he chooses, but Everton can't afford to get into a bidding war next!\n45 Posted 11/07/2023 at 14:27:04\nThe signings to watch out for are promising players from overseas at under £10m. If we don't pick up one or two like that, then we just continue in our death cycle.\n46 Posted 11/07/2023 at 14:33:23\nIt's also galling that the 'monied' clubs such as Spurs are able to bring in a 23 year old striker on a free, namely, Manor Solomon from Shaktar Donesk on a five year deal. He was on loan at Fulham last season and scored five goals in 24 appearances. Perhaps, he isn't the right player for Everton at the minute, but there are players out there, I just wish the club would get the latest edition of Football Manager rather than clinging on to the 2009 edition.\n47 Posted 11/07/2023 at 14:44:48\n48 Posted 11/07/2023 at 15:00:46\n49 Posted 11/07/2023 at 15:01:22\n50 Posted 11/07/2023 at 15:03:40\n51 Posted 11/07/2023 at 15:06:44\n52 Posted 11/07/2023 at 15:08:50\nSurely an upgrade on Maupay.\nI also got the impression that Dyche only used true target men at Burnley because he was forced into a fairly industrial style of football by their lack of resources. In his brief spell at Everton so far, I think he's showed signs of wanting to play decent, constructive football.\nPiroe would help with that.\n53 Posted 11/07/2023 at 15:28:51\nAs far as I can see there is less than a handful that could be considered as successful in the Premier league.\nManagers will always manage not just coach and in realty why should'nt a director of football type report to the manager rather than the other way around.\nTactics and style of play are usually dictated by the players you have rather than some genius who insists that the cultural play of a club should be consistent throughout a club.\nIts all about getting the best talent and moulding them into an effective style of play which is usually largely managed by the manager(coach?).\nIf someone can sell me on the benefits of a DOF I would be interested to listen.\n54 Posted 11/07/2023 at 15:34:44\n55 Posted 11/07/2023 at 15:36:08\nPersonally, given where my expectations are this season I'd be happy with Young, Piroe, Gnonto and Wharton. 3 young, hungry players who we can develop with some old heads around them.\nNot to mention there are many on here (myself included) who believe that in Patterson, Myko, Garner and Brainthwaite we have some young players to build a side around for the future and BMD.\nGosh, that was the most optimistic post I've put on for a while! I need a lie down.\n56 Posted 11/07/2023 at 15:36:28\n57 Posted 11/07/2023 at 16:11:13\n58 Posted 11/07/2023 at 16:37:54\ngoalie Tom Heaton from Man Utd aged 37. At least that would bring our combined goalkeeper and two fullbacks, Coleman and Young, age down to 111.\n59 Posted 11/07/2023 at 17:25:39\nCheaper, more experienced, scores more, bigger attacking threat, proven striker, can play as a central striker.\nNo brainer.\n61 Posted 11/07/2023 at 17:59:35\nOn the context of our financial plight, Rodrigo is probably the best we can do. Maybe do Maupay in part exchange. In the latter's credit column, he has at least shown he can score in the Championship. At least he could once upon a time.\nI read we are in for Tom Heaton. Given we have just given a new contract to our resident pensioner goalie and re-signed Virginia, does this mean Jordan is off to Man Utd? At the very least, is it a hedge in case they don't get Onana from Inter and turn to Pickford instead?\nTo turn to a positive â€“ not many of those these days â€“ I thought Garner looked like a real player in the U21 tournament. Did a very decent job out of position and it looked like he has a very good football brain. Right now, he seems to be one of our rare bargains.\n62 Posted 11/07/2023 at 18:02:56\nPiroe scored 19 in 43 games for an admittedly poor Swansea team last season. Maupay scored 25 in 43 for Brentford a few years back in the same league.\nI'm sure Piroe will do ok somewhere but he has a similar profile to Maupay and I don't think that's what we need or what Dyche wants. I don't expect Dyche to move too far away from the direct style he favoured for us last year.\nIf available for £8m as reported then Piroe is certainly good value but i just don't think its the right fit for us.\n63 Posted 11/07/2023 at 18:08:15\nI know a guy who's diehard Leeds, and he tells me otherwise, so if we get him, I'll gladly be proved wrong.\n66 Posted 11/07/2023 at 19:02:38\nEverton manager Sean Dyche is eyeing a reunion with former Manchester United loanee Wout Weghorst, who he signed during his time at Burnley. The 30-year-old is back at Turf Moor after spending six months on loan at Old Trafford, but is expected to move on once more despite the Clarets' promotion back to the Premier League. Dyche signed Weghorst to a three-and-a-half year contract in January 2022 - only to lose his job three months later as Burnley attempted to stave off the threat of relegation - and is interested in linking up again at Goodison Park. The Dutch striker also has interest in Turkey, where he spent the first half of last season on loan. Werder Bremen's Niklas Fullkrug, top scorer in the Bundesliga last season alongside Christopher Nkunku, is another long-term target for Everton - he also has interest from Fiorentina - while Ashley Young is expected to rebuff interest from Sheffield United, Luton and Burnley to join as a free agent. Outgoings wise, Everton are ready to listen to offers for Demarai Gray amid interest from a number of Premier League clubs and also from the Saudi Pro League. Crystal Palace, West Ham and Brentford are keeping an eye on Gray's situation on Merseyside, with the club already looking at potential alternatives - Leeds' Willy Gnonto among those considered.\n67 Posted 11/07/2023 at 19:17:39\n68 Posted 11/07/2023 at 19:35:00\nLet the Wout jokes begin but I would not be bothered by that at all. It would signal strong belief that DCL will play enough games with the chance to rest sufficiently. Also we don't really change our game just because of change in personnel with Weghorst. Finally he is at Burnley and although someone mentioned a brouhaha with Dyche I think at 30 that is no big deal nor will he be asking for one which is ideal.\nWout the hell? On favorable terms give him a shot.\nAnd give this a thought, we could put Tark, Doucoure, Onana and Wout in the box for corners. I'm tbinking that could produce a few goals.\n69 Posted 11/07/2023 at 19:49:37\nWe're not in discussions with Leeds Utd over Gnonto. No bids either! Another weird rumor!\n70 Posted 11/07/2023 at 19:55:42\n71 Posted 11/07/2023 at 20:04:34\n72 Posted 11/07/2023 at 20:12:41\nI would love if he was fully fit and could maintain his fitness but we have to look beyond his decent season of a few years back. It's time he fought for a starting place and dispel the entitlement notions.\n73 Posted 11/07/2023 at 20:12:49\nWe do need a back up for Calvert-Lewin as the first priority, they are not going to be his equal when he's fit, but thats the rub when he's fit.\nI like the idea of signing Rodrigo in preference to Gnonto, he seems a more dangerous player to me.\nI trust Dyche will know exactly by now where he needs to strengthen and will have a list of potential buys, but the hard part is getting them to sign on the dotted line.\n74 Posted 11/07/2023 at 20:18:10\nHysteria over! Just another bullshit media frenzy, why do we fall for it every time?\n75 Posted 11/07/2023 at 20:53:59\n77 Posted 11/07/2023 at 20:59:18\nProbably wants to stay with a Champions League club but I'm hoping we're throwing our hat into the ring for these types of players.\n78 Posted 11/07/2023 at 21:02:21\nAt the very least though we have to have a proper back-up serious challenger to Calvert-Lewinsigned and prepped before the first game. There's no way we can do a repeat performance of last season where we are scrambling around pathetically for someone to lead the line. If that happens again, I'll start believing the conspiracy theories.\n79 Posted 11/07/2023 at 21:05:08\n80 Posted 11/07/2023 at 21:08:22\n81 Posted 11/07/2023 at 21:31:33\nIts changing by the minute lol.\nApparently, Dyche wants Niclas Fullkrug now.\nRoss Barkley is also in the mix.\n82 Posted 11/07/2023 at 21:39:59\n83 Posted 11/07/2023 at 21:44:05\n84 Posted 11/07/2023 at 21:49:25\n85 Posted 11/07/2023 at 21:59:01\nCan't beat a bit of experienceâ€¦\n86 Posted 11/07/2023 at 22:04:00\n87 Posted 11/07/2023 at 22:13:35\n88 Posted 11/07/2023 at 22:13:35\nWithout wanting to get into the speculation of transfers, which I try not to, it seems there are four camps:\n1. We shouldn't be signing perceived aged veterans.\n2. We should be signing experience to compliment a relatively young squad (average 25?).\n3. We shouldn't be signing unproven teenagers for a lot of money from a relegated team.\n4. We should invest in a young player with potential that we know little about, but others might.\nI guess that's what opinions are for.\nI don't even know if he played against us last season. I didn't notice him if he did.\nI leave these decisions to the manager and DoF.\n89 Posted 11/07/2023 at 22:22:35\n90 Posted 11/07/2023 at 22:24:17\nHe is usually well informed.\nBut let's see!!\n91 Posted 11/07/2023 at 22:30:29\n1) Selling Alan Ball to Arsenal.\n2) Heysel and the European ban\n3) The sale of Wayne Rooney to Man U\nBut the most catastrophic, tragic, gut wrenching and soul destroying occurrence without a doubt has been the kenshite/Moshiri blight which has befallen us.\n92 Posted 11/07/2023 at 22:36:08\n93 Posted 11/07/2023 at 22:37:44\n94 Posted 11/07/2023 at 22:48:47\nI watched some YouTube of him. Hasn't missed any meals, that's for sure.\n95 Posted 11/07/2023 at 23:11:07\n96 Posted 11/07/2023 at 23:49:21\nAnyone care to guess how much he's made out of us? Paul probably knows. I reckon around £50m at a guess. And he still takes his expenses.\n97 Posted 12/07/2023 at 02:23:59\nThey are just opinions and there's probably many more too.\nWhat I think the supporters need to do is to force these pricks that are running the shit show to explain what the fook is going on. Also, when are the sports media gonna ask some big questions or are we simply that irrelevant ?\nThe silence is their way of continuing with the norm of hiding the truth about the mess we are in. The longer it goes on the more accepting that the supporters will be.\nThe signing of Ashley Young is a very big indicator of where we are at regardless of this players experience. Dyche will be swallowing a bitter pill right now after his strong words regarding our situation because he knows that without a better goal return than last season we will drop. Fortunately for Dyche he will be paid handsomely for the dent in his professional pride but we just go on suffering.\n98 Posted 12/07/2023 at 05:41:14\nWe shouldn't sign older players, we need young players but not on the wing, we don't need more wingers, we need a striker, we shouldn't sign players from relegated clubs, we should sign players from relegated clubs.\nAnd it's only Wednesday!\n99 Posted 12/07/2023 at 08:54:25\nDo I hold him completely accountable for this shit show? No, Moshiri (the fool's fool) has played a major part in this too. Toxic combination, others too have bled us dry.\nHowever, I don't see how anyone can blame him for charging expenses or for making money from his shares? What do people expect? That he works for free and sells his shares at cost? Come on, be angry yes, let's protest, yesâ€¦ but let's not let the narrative get diluted with ridiculous expectations.\nMSP will see us through; the liar and the fool will go and we will march on again with Dyche at the helm. Onwards. COYB.\n100 Posted 12/07/2023 at 10:48:57\nBilly Liar won't go without a shove and he is yet to show his hand on the import of a striker or two. That particular task has got a resounding 'Fail!' against it from earlier and is still outstanding and just as important now as when Lukaku moved on.\nI shall wait a little longer before deciding finally whether to continue being a Blues supporter or give up as Everton seem to be a total lost cause.\nHe has done a good job of killing this club. I, as many others, am seriously contemplating jumping ship before it sinks. Football itself stinks and is corrupt from top to bottom and I don't think it has reached its nadir yet. I'll wait a little longer before deciding because, after nearly 70 years, it is a hard decision.\n101 Posted 12/07/2023 at 11:33:11\nAlfredo Morelos - proven goals scorer and supplier of assists.\nAge 27\nFree transfer\nWorth a punt in my opinion.\n102 Posted 12/07/2023 at 11:44:40\n103 Posted 12/07/2023 at 11:57:31\n104 Posted 12/07/2023 at 15:46:58\nIt's at least one relegation, maybe two before he becomes the answer.\n105 Posted 12/07/2023 at 15:54:53\nBrace yourself though, because I'm going to make an outlandish comparison with none other than. Harry Kane!\nObviously Piroe is not (ahem) quite up there with the Spurs striker - but the similarity is making up for a lack of pace with good technique, hold up play and an ability to shoot from distance.\nKane does well with the likes of Son and (in the past) Alli, providing the injection of pace and running in behind. The likes of Gray (or Danjuma / Gnonto / Elanga etc) and Doucoure can provide a bargain basement version of the same sort of thing.\nAnyway, cue endless ridicule etc for that observation (some of it richly deserved).\n106 Posted 12/07/2023 at 15:56:32\nDefinitely not what we need then.\nWhat little money we may have to spend should be targeted at somebody who can play that lone centre forward role effectively, preferably proven to be effective in this League.\n107 Posted 12/07/2023 at 16:17:27\n108 Posted 12/07/2023 at 21:59:01\nI posted on here a couple of years ago that we should make a move for him. Just my opinion fellas.\nHe could play with DCL or on his own up front. One thing I am sure of, wherever he ends up he will score goals.\n109 Posted 12/07/2023 at 22:15:05\n110 Posted 13/07/2023 at 08:22:54\n111 Posted 13/07/2023 at 09:06:20\n112 Posted 13/07/2023 at 09:20:06\n113 Posted 13/07/2023 at 09:40:25\nIn almost 4000 minutes last year Piroe managed only 2 assists with 0.8 key passes per game. I'm not sure he has anywhere near the playmaking ability of Kane. Even in the Championship.\nHe can finish, I'll give him that. And for that alone he's maybe worth a punt at £8-10m but I don't expect him to be anywhere near the top of the list.\n114 Posted 13/07/2023 at 14:10:12\n115 Posted 14/07/2023 at 16:32:22\n116 Posted 15/07/2023 at 07:44:34\nFast forward 2 months and to solve the forward problem we look to sign another supplier to the forward we don't haveâ€¦\nFucking amazing!\nHow the hell Moshiri got to be a billionaire is beyond me. He buys a football club who constantly spunk his money on dross but continues to let them, he employs numerous DoFs who fail, he loses one of the two constants at Everton â€“ the supporters â€“ but doesn't care.\nHe supports the other constant at Everton (Blue Bill) who seems committed to sinking us just to rub our noses in it and we will still not have a new forward for the start of the season.\n117 Posted 15/07/2023 at 07:51:44\nIn this day and age of drugs, blood money, corruption etcâ€¦ in the game why should we sit on our moral high horse while our rivals do whatever it takes to achieve success?\nI'll put on my tin hat and get my coat.\n118 Posted 15/07/2023 at 08:25:13\nRalph, suppliers with no one to supply to. I think there is a bit of reconfiguration going on. Gray will be sold if possible, Iwobi too if they both won't sign new contracts. The club can't allow them to run their contracts down, we've got to cash in. So the Gnonto deal will be related to that, but we probably want to sell first before we buy or we will be hamstrung for the rest of the window.\nAfter last summer and January, it's understood the total lack of confidence in us getting a striker in as a back-up and essentially a challenger to Calvert-Lewin. Back-up on its own doesn't cover it, this player has to score goals and make Dom think \"Shit! I've got to up my game or I'm sidelined\".\nIt's the way it should be and even more so with the most critical position on he pitch. No goals: no wins, no points, relegation fight. This cycle had to be stopped this window.\n119 Posted 15/07/2023 at 08:32:35\nThe Mendy case is obviously clearer but, honestly, it doesn't sound like he has (or at least had) the lifestyle of someone you'd want to employ.\nThis, and the recent Dele Alli revelations about widespread reliance on sleeping pills and more, makes you wonder what clubs are doing to look after their players as human beings and (even if you're more hard-nosed) as investments.\nSurely after spending £65M on Mendy, Man City would have an interest in him not having unprotected sex with multiple partners at regular drink and nitrous oxide parties. And surely these clubs can should monitor how the players are living their lives away from the training ground.\nI wonder what Everton are doing with our players?\n120 Posted 15/07/2023 at 08:35:40\nAny more than that would be too much I think. Interesting player and am curious where Dyche sees him playing. He could play right- or left-wing but doesn't offer the physical alternative to Calvert-Lewin, I don't think. He could be an intriguing option playing off him.\nI think he has a lot of potential but I do find it slightly annoying that Leeds bought him for only £4M last summer. We need to start picking up these players earlier.\n121 Posted 15/07/2023 at 09:01:02\nThe frustrating ones for me are the glaringly obvious, no brainer punts in Europe that clubs make and double their money in a year. So whilst I would be no help picking the likes of Gnonto out as an 18 year old, it was clear that some are going to make it. The ones who trip off the tongue are signings like Raphina when at Rennes, Doku in Belgium, Openda two years ago, Wahi two years ago etc. It's not rocket science.\nIt looks like this one might happen, I like the look of him but don't remember much about him when we played them, I think I watched that game through my fingers! I think this signing isn't an addition, it's a Gray replacement, let's hope we get good coin from the Saudi's. He will be an upgrade and have considerably more sell on value, good business. I hope it happens.\nTony Everan there is one more step bud, \"Gnonto on the verge of signing\", until Everton realise he is 19 and it wouldn't fit with our policy of signing over 35's. Word on the street is 58 year old former Cameroon legend Roger Mila is considering our offer to bring him out of retirement, the lure of PL football was just to great for him apparently!\nSo, if (hypothetically) Gnonto is Gray's replacement for little to no outlay, I suspect Harrison, Elanga or Djanjuma is to cover the right, that leaves us needing a striker by my calculations. Who'd have thunk it?!!! Get a move on Everton FFS, I feel like we've been saying this for about 5 years. It's getting to the stage where I think it's more likely to be in the Piroe category. My dream signing would be Ndaiye still.\n122 Posted 15/07/2023 at 09:38:47\nStrikers, goalscorers surely is the priority. Rumour the manager wants Wieghorst is also worrying for me, he's not going to score a lot.\n123 Posted 15/07/2023 at 09:56:51\nI am getting more worried as time ticks on that a capable striker will not materialize before the window slams shut in our face again.\n124 Posted 15/07/2023 at 10:01:29\nThe recent one that haunts me is Caicedo. He was so good at so young in South America and loads of the online scouts (whose work I appropriate) were raving about him. £5M was clearly a steal and we so lacked a midfield dynamo at the time! Lo and behold, a few years later he's worth £80M.\nHaving said that, there's loads I get wrong too!\n125 Posted 15/07/2023 at 10:08:25\nHowever, we do need to be careful if we're going to cash in on either or both of Gray (33 games, 5 goal contributions) and Iwobi (38 games, 10 goal contributions) this summer - rather than lose them for free this time next year.\nWhilst I would prefer us to be signing the likes of Gnonto at source at low cost, if we're losing established and (though not brilliant) productive players, we need people coming in who can hit the ground running. That makes it more understandable why this summer we're looking at players with Premier League and UK experience like Gnonto, Elanga and Danjuma.\nUnfortunately that experience comes at a premium in terms of cost.\nIf we can pull the squad into better shape on this basis, then perhaps next year we can start a more constructive policy of buying talent at source for development.\n126 Posted 15/07/2023 at 10:11:52\nYou can hear players and staff discussing Johnny Evans on his way to Everton?\n127 Posted 15/07/2023 at 10:19:06\nI wouldn't go for him, I he's been a Steady Eddy of a player but he's not dominating enough as a centre-back, a bit of a librarian about him. If I was a centre-forward, I'd be thinking I would fancy my chances against him.\n128 Posted 15/07/2023 at 10:22:30\nThere been rumours they want Onana, also looking at Iwobi. Things will get a bit more interesting over the next couple of weeks.\n129 Posted 15/07/2023 at 13:19:37\nToo small to cover for Dom, can't hold the ball up, had a bit of an in-and-out first season so hasn't proved himself yet.\nI prefer Danjuma or Dembele, both can play any position across the front three, are good target men and have a good goal ratio.\nWaste of £18 - 20 million that we haven't got.\n130 Posted 15/07/2023 at 13:21:24\nI mean beside searching for highlight clips of players on YouTube, like they did when we signed Maupay!?\n131 Posted 15/07/2023 at 13:36:33\n132 Posted 15/07/2023 at 13:49:11\nOn paper, yes lol.\n133 Posted 15/07/2023 at 13:51:36\nAs it happens, £18M isn't a bad price at all for someone with Gnonto's profile (record in Switzerland, International credentials and quality â€“ albeit patchy â€“ play for Leeds last season).\nThe only proven players we can afford will generally be injury prone, old or both. This profile of a player has really not served us well of late.\nI do agree that we should be focussing our attention on a striker, rather than a wing / forward type (although we do need both).\n134 Posted 15/07/2023 at 13:55:00\n135 Posted 15/07/2023 at 14:23:40\n136 Posted 15/07/2023 at 14:29:28\n137 Posted 15/07/2023 at 14:41:35\n138 Posted 15/07/2023 at 15:03:32\n139 Posted 15/07/2023 at 15:24:12\n140 Posted 15/07/2023 at 17:18:06\nHis only attributes are he is fast and energetic and puts a shift in, but so do lots of 19-year-olds.\nBetter off giving Mills and Cannon a boost with a few games and get a decent backup for Calvert-Lewin.\n141 Posted 15/07/2023 at 17:22:02\nIf we sign him, let's maybe allow him to get his boots on before we start giving him the â€˜championship at best' treatment.\nUs Everton fans criticise players who create goals and assists - James, Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison and Iwobi - but love players who have no talent but get a sweat on like Niasse and Stracqualursi.\nStill time to change your mind, Wilfried!\n142 Posted 15/07/2023 at 17:39:21\nAt the same age, Stanley Mills scored 3 in 25 for the Everton U21s while playing in a fairly similar position â€“ and Tom Cannon managed 10 in 20 in the Everton U18s, playing in his customary striker role. The Swiss League is not the best but it is incomparably better than academy football.\nGnonto is absolutely streets ahead of both players â€“ and has much more to his game than pace, energy and work-rate.\n143 Posted 15/07/2023 at 17:52:28\n144 Posted 15/07/2023 at 17:58:56\nWe will finish 4 places further up just as a result of players being off the treatment table and being cohesive.\nA few results going our way improving confidence will probably mean the domestic treble at season's end and, yes, no European trophy â€“ but you can't have everything.\nI've restarted swimming training and changed my free style breathing so not sure if I'm getting enough oxygen. I'll check it later.\n145 Posted 15/07/2023 at 18:25:17\nWe've hit the Midlands in force scouting Young from Villa and GyÃ¶keres from Coventry. Another 500-odd miles further South and we'll be over The Channel before you know it.\n146 Posted 15/07/2023 at 19:11:59\nI'm not suggesting we bring in Jonny Evans but believe me he is no librarian. He has a real mean and nasty streak. Just seems to be injured more often now.\n147 Posted 15/07/2023 at 19:13:31\nI will believe it when he is holding up the royal blue shirt.\n148 Posted 15/07/2023 at 19:15:33\nInjuries left a poor keeper and poor defenders like Faes exposed.\n149 Posted 15/07/2023 at 19:47:51\nFrom a Leeds supporter I've known for 20 years who has followed them all his life. Apparently a very good player but not one to have in the trenches, which is why he spent the last 6 games on the bench.\nHis words not mine.\nSo as long as we're pushing for Europe, he could be a good signing. You never know.\n151 Posted 16/07/2023 at 11:26:17\n152 Posted 16/07/2023 at 11:45:48\nLeeds reject Everton's £15m bid for Wilfried Gnonto\nThey are \"determined not to sell the winger this summer despite relegation\". His contract runs until 2027 and does not contain a relegation release clause, supposedly strengthening Leeds's position.\n153 Posted 16/07/2023 at 12:24:15\nSeems this may have legs though.\nI also saw a tentative rumour about Pickford to Man Utd for £70M this morning.\nAnd Gomes to Lille?\nI need to switch off but can't.\nWigan next week.\n154 Posted 16/07/2023 at 14:40:48\nWe end up being linked to 3 or 4 players consistently for several weeks only to find out that there is no intention to sell or that the target chose Southampton instead.\nIf Leeds genuinely had no interest in selling this lad, wouldn't Thelwell know this already? What exactly is he doing?\n155 Posted 16/07/2023 at 15:36:33\n156 Posted 16/07/2023 at 15:39:01\n157 Posted 16/07/2023 at 20:26:55\n158 Posted 16/07/2023 at 21:55:21\n159 Posted 16/07/2023 at 22:33:30\n160 Posted 17/07/2023 at 07:22:32\n161 Posted 17/07/2023 at 08:14:50\n162 Posted 17/07/2023 at 08:50:18\nGray is something of an enigma. When he gets the ball, I always think he is one of those players who can make things happen. But, too often, he doesn't.\n163 Posted 17/07/2023 at 09:14:09\nGray is like most players who can't get to the very top. He has a lot to his game but he can't produce it, week-in & week-out.\nThe truly great players produce something every week.\nLesser players always need that extra touch which leads to them being tackled or losing possession or slowing the speed of the attack.\nThese are the type of players that populate the teams outside of the top 6 or 7 clubs.\n164 Posted 17/07/2023 at 09:50:08\nHowever, the skinflint in me is thinking, if we are going to spend £15M or £20M on a player, as speculated in the press, I would prefer to spend it on a centre-forward.\n165 Posted 17/07/2023 at 10:17:19\nIt's why I would have loved to have seen James play at Goodison, and also why I look forward to the visit of Manchester City. Despite the inevitable defeat, it's a real pleasure to witness, first-hand, top class ball control and skill.\n166 Posted 17/07/2023 at 15:06:04\nNot sure about James Ward-Prowse's creativity but, he can contribute with 9-10 goals a season just from free kicks.\n167 Posted 17/07/2023 at 15:28:55\n9-10 goals a season from free kicks!!!! Are you sure mate???\nAbsolutely no chance. Look up the stats â€“ I'd take 4 a season.\nSadly I don't think Ward-Prowse would come to us and we need two strikers, a winger and a centre-back before thinking about his position.\n168 Posted 17/07/2023 at 15:51:55\nSorry. It should have been 9-10 goals from free kicks and shots from outside the box.\n169 Posted 17/07/2023 at 16:01:46\nThat would be amazing: to have a goal scoring midfielder again!\nTo be clear, I'd definitely take him but we desperately need a couple of strikers first\n170 Posted 17/07/2023 at 16:03:20\n171 Posted 17/07/2023 at 16:44:35\nLeeds will not want to let Gnonto go and the likes of Elanga & Danjuma will have better options.\nIf we find some gems this likely to become groundhog Day.\nWere due to lose a number of players to the African Nations cup in January. who is going to replace them. were a serious injury away from disaster.\n172 Posted 18/07/2023 at 23:32:17\n173 Posted 18/07/2023 at 23:36:54\n174 Posted 18/07/2023 at 00:46:10\nSorry â€“ apologies to younger viewers â€“but I'm not savvy to modern timesâ€¦\nThat said, I currently am listening to my today delivered first pressing mono French original vinyl 1966 Dylan “Blonde On Blonde“â€¦â€¦.fucken hell/jeezâ€¦â€¦â€¦ sorryâ€¦.. ignore previous commentâ€¦â€¦\n175 Posted 19/07/2023 at 02:01:06\nNow, of course, I'm \"outdated\" and \"postdated\".\n176 Posted 19/07/2023 at 03:30:14\nMaybe they are waiting for those special Dyche training days to be over so they don't have to go through them. Has there been any reports from them 2 days, of any injuries?\n177 Posted 19/07/2023 at 07:35:01\n178 Posted 19/07/2023 at 18:50:44\nWe should keep everyone because quite frankly there is no sign that anyone worth having will come to Everton.\nI would pay Leicester a small fee for Vardy and I would give him a more than fair contract to get the deal done; otherwise, he will go elsewhere. He is the type of player we need who might come to us.\nSome Evertonians need a reality check. No one is coming to us except maybe an experienced player like Vardy who wants Premier League football. It is the best we can do at present until Everton can make themselves a more viable proposition.\nIwobi is one of our best players. He is more often than not involved in creating our best chances, works hard, can play in different positions, and isn't injury prone, so why the hell would we want to lose him now when we will need him and won't get an adequate replacement for him???\nWe are in a mess, we are going to be in a relegation fight again if we are not careful, and we need to drop the idea that we must sell to buy; otherwise, we could end up with an even weaker squad than we had last season.\nA big reality check is needed from everyone!\n179 Posted 19/07/2023 at 22:16:42\nAccording an Italian sauce.\n180 Posted 19/07/2023 at 22:16:50\nHe was a joke when we bought him for £28 mill with £7 mill add ons\nAnd he has been since\nCan't cross, can't take set plays and never scores\nWould rather see a youngster playing in his position\nMark my words come chrimbo everyone will want him out\n181 Posted 19/07/2023 at 23:13:38\n182 Posted 19/07/2023 at 23:30:19\n183 Posted 20/07/2023 at 01:48:46\n184 Posted 20/07/2023 at 06:33:53\nIan, Phil, I think the club has to be more concerned about Iwobi's contract situation. The question has to be asked what makes the club stronger. Sell him now , get a fee and buy a replacement? Or keep him for a season and let him run down his contract and leave for nothing?\nWe've got to sell him if a decent offer comes along and it's up to Thelwell to use the money to replace him .\nWe have got to learn to be more financially savvy as a club otherwise we will never escape the debilitating shackles of the P&S rules. Football for the majority of clubs is not always just about buying the right players, it's also knowing when to sell the right ones too.\n185 Posted 20/07/2023 at 07:20:25\n186 Posted 20/07/2023 at 08:09:30\nAgree Tony that if there is a half decent offer on the table for Iwobi we should take it. I like him, honest, hard working and he has proved some doubters wrong. Business is business though as they say.\nTo lose money on Schneiderlin, Bolasie, Tosun et al is one thing. However, only Everton under Moshiri could massively overpay for Iwobi, have the lad perform well for 18 months and STILL lose him on a free. Everton that.\n187 Posted 20/07/2023 at 08:47:59\n188 Posted 20/07/2023 at 09:03:12\n189 Posted 20/07/2023 at 09:23:06\n190 Posted 20/07/2023 at 09:38:56\n191 Posted 20/07/2023 at 09:45:02\n192 Posted 20/07/2023 at 09:52:53\nI think Danjuma could prove a very useful player. Can play anywhere across the front, including striker. He can dribble he can pass and crucially he can definitely score. Has a bit of bite to him too. On a good day I think he will remind people a bit of Richarlison.\n193 Posted 20/07/2023 at 10:18:00\n194 Posted 20/07/2023 at 10:23:12\nI'm not one to hold grudges though, so welcome to Everton Arnie! Once Everton has touched you etc\n195 Posted 20/07/2023 at 10:25:36\nAs with all speculation, however advanced, I'll still not believe it until the eerie smile, scarf aloft and the ink is dry on the contract.\nAs for grudges , I couldn't care less about the January episode. The only grudge I'll have is if he doesn't give the full 100% for Everton out on the pitch. If he gives us that week in and week out he will be respected for it. If he gets us ten league goals plus he may even be loved for it.\n196 Posted 20/07/2023 at 10:30:43\nHopefully will also lead to other signings, either loan or permanent if we have money spare.\nNeed at least two more striking options.\n197 Posted 20/07/2023 at 10:32:23\nHim and Gnonto improve the team, and I'm sure we all agree that's the most important thing.\n198 Posted 20/07/2023 at 10:42:39\nAlso, he was clocked as the 7th fastest player in the PL last season. Sounds like an Anthony Gordon upgrade to me, so I'm made up.\n199 Posted 20/07/2023 at 10:48:37\n200 Posted 20/07/2023 at 11:27:02\nAll we need now is to improve on Maupay and things may be a bit more optimistic.\n201 Posted 20/07/2023 at 11:29:53\n202 Posted 20/07/2023 at 11:40:30\n203 Posted 20/07/2023 at 12:09:26\n204 Posted 20/07/2023 at 12:12:57\n205 Posted 20/07/2023 at 12:18:28\n206 Posted 20/07/2023 at 12:20:45\nTell him we'll pick him up at the airport for his medical and then leave him there, I'd rather nobody came in.\n207 Posted 20/07/2023 at 12:27:17\nIf he'd done a lot better than that then we'd be unlikely to have a chance at signing him probably.\nAll transfers are a gamble but if we get him for around £16-18m then I think even he doesn't do that well for the next year or so we'd still probably not lose money on him. Like with Kean. Decent value. Highly thought of. Very young still.\nHe wouldn't have been top of my list but if we get him for a decent price I'll be excited to see what he can do for the next few years.\nWhat is confusing perhaps is that both Danjuma and Gnonto (and indeed Mcneill and Iwobi and Gray) prefer to play off the left. Surprised we're not going for someone who's more comfortable on the right.\n208 Posted 20/07/2023 at 12:51:13\n“A big reality check is needed from everyone!â€\nAnd most of all you yourself, Jim, with your suggestion that “ we need to drop the idea that we must sell to buyâ€.\n“Reality checkâ€, Jim, we need to “sell to buyâ€. It is not an \"idea\", it is the \"reality\".\n209 Posted 20/07/2023 at 12:51:48\nEverton's dealings will no doubt be long drawn out because of financial constraints and we cannot expect much activity in this off season unless they can offload a few which doesn't appear to be happening just yet.\nThere may be some hidden gems in the younger squad which we all hope for but up front may still be the biggest drawback when the season starts.\nIdeally we would love to see a fully fit DCL and a resurgent Maupay but that is doubtful and even then may not be good enough to worry many Prem. defences.\nEverton avoided relegation thanks to the late season heroics of Doucoure along with some very vital goal contributions from Coleman, Tarkowski, Keane and Mcneill that gained precious points but generally the offensive qualities were quite abysmal for the most part.\nIt's hard to be upbeat about the new season but we all hope it will be considerably better than last.\n210 Posted 20/07/2023 at 13:15:20\n211 Posted 20/07/2023 at 13:44:43\n212 Posted 20/07/2023 at 13:51:04\nWhat I am looking for is are they better than what we have and should they improve the the team, and I believe the answer is yes.They will provide competition for starting places, coverage for injuries. and if they can score a bonus that we are missing with the present forwards\nEvery signing is a risk as players sometime take time to bed in, but if this happens by the weekend it gives them time to settle in.Lets hope they start to move a few out.\n213 Posted 20/07/2023 at 13:51:22\n214 Posted 20/07/2023 at 13:54:47\n215 Posted 20/07/2023 at 13:57:55\n216 Posted 20/07/2023 at 14:02:16\nGood news, despite what some OTT merchants claim.\n217 Posted 20/07/2023 at 14:12:24\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
