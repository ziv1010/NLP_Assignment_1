Wales international Joe Ledley took over.\nBlues nemesis Nugent shot wide from the edge of the box in the 35th minute, then two minutes later Mount crossed from the right, Bartosz Bialkowski punched to the 18-yard line from where Bryson scuffed a shot into a Town player.\nThe Blues had spent most of the period in their own half albeit without Derby looking overly threatening for the most part but on 40 Ward twisted and turned in the box having seen his first shot blocked and his second effort took a deflection but fortunately flew straight to Scott Carson in the Rams goal.\nTwo minutes later Ellis Harrison caught one-time Town academy schoolboy and ballboy Richard Keogh in possession on halfway and the Ireland international hauled him down and was deservedly shown the yellow card by referee Scott Duncan.\nJust prior to the fourth official holding up his board to indicate three additional minutes, a loose ball fell to Chalobah following a corner but the midfielder screwed his shot high and wide.\nThe scoreline remained 0-0 at the break which was a fair reflection of a not particularly enthralling first half of few chances at both ends.\nDerby had had most of the ball but had been unable to force Bialkowski into a save with their rather ponderous approach.\nCarson had also been relatively untroubled, Ward’s late effort aside, although the Rams hadn’t looked entirely comfortable defending Town corners. Blues boss Paul Hurst is likely to have been the happier of the two managers walking off at the break.\nDerby: Carson, Forsyth, Bryson, Tomori, Keogh (c), Mount, Lawrence, Evans (Ledley 27), Bennett, Nugent, Bogle. Unused: Roos, Wisdom, Waghorn, Jozefzoon, Marriott, Lowe.\nTown: Bialkowski, Donacien, Nsiala, Chambers (c), Knudsen, Chalobah, Skuse, Ward, Nolan, Edwards, Harrison. Unused: Gerken, Jackson, Spence, Roberts, Sears, Downes. Kenlock. Referee: Scott Duncan (Northumberland).\nPhoto: Action Images via Reuters\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nWhat exactly was our plan tonight??.\nIt's all starting to make a lot of sense as to why a lot of our established championship players decided to leave at the very end of the window.\nWe need to bring in some experienced heads on loan ASAP. Otherwise I fear for this season. Is Hurst and his L1/2 contingent out of their depth? Only time will tell.\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
