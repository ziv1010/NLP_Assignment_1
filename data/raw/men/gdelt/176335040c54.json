You have here [on the punditry panel] former players who have all been big players and all of them went through some bad moments.\n‘It’s normal. It’s like a team. You cannot expect Cole Palmer, every season or every game, to be like last season or like the first part of the season. It’s normal, it’s something normal.\n‘He’s a human being, he’s missing some things and now it’s how we react. So I was telling him that. Everything is normal. He’s happy, he’s okay.’\nThe Chelsea head coach added: ‘I’ve said already that he has been lucky in his career, even if he is young, because he’s shared moments, changing rooms, with top players.\n‘He knows that any top players go through bad moments.\n‘It’s how you react. Keep calm, keep working, keep laughing. Be calm, be happy, enjoy the football. It’s the only thing you have to do.’\nMaresca was able to hand minutes to some of Chelsea’s exciting young talent as the clock wound down at Stamford Bridge, with Mathis Amougou, Tyrique George, Shim Mheuka and Josh Acheampong all introduced in the second period.\n‘There were probably too many young players at the end! But it’s nice to see,’ Maresca said.\n‘It was also the game a little bit that we can give young players a chance to get some minutes.\n‘But for sure, Chelsea’s academy has always been a good one so we already have many players like Levi [Colwill] who is there and in the future we can have more.’\nAsked whether Chelsea’s youngsters could receive more opportunities over the coming weeks, the Italian replied: ‘Yes, especially because we have the Europa Conference League and then after two days we have Leicester here.\nMore Trending\n‘And for us, the priority is to bring this club to where this club has to be which is the Champions League.’\nMaresca remains confident his Chelsea side can secure a top-four finish but knows his players ‘need to be ready’ right up until the final day of the season.\nQuizzed on Chelsea’s top-four chances, Maresca responded: ‘If we are able to win games then we are going to be there. If we lose games…\n‘It will be up and down and it’s how we managed that. We need to be ready.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: ‘We expect more from him’ – Enzo Maresca sends message to Chelsea star after Southampton win\nMORE: ‘Get on with it’ – Tim Sherwood questions Chelsea celebration during Southampton win\nMORE: ‘That would be perfect’ – Joe Cole tips Chelsea legend to become permanent Rangers manager",
