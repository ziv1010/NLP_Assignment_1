  "body_text": "England vs Australia LIVE: Result and reaction as Ollie Watkins’ goal secures Three Lions victory\nEngland edged past Australia in an international friendly at Wembley to keep their recent winning run alive and give them a touch of momentum heading into a crucial Euro 2024 qualifier against Italy next week.\nAfter Gareth Southgate named an inexperienced starting XI to take on the Socceroos, the Three Lions took their time to settle. The controlled possession but failed to make much of an impact in the first half with Ollie Watkins - leading the line in the absence of Harry Kane - missing two great chances.\nAt the other end of the pitch, Australia should have gone ahead through Ryan Strain whose shto from the right side of the box was beautifully kept out by a back-tracking Lewis Dunk.\nAfter the break things were different. England upped the tempo and operated higher up the pitch. Trent Alexander-Arnold found Jack Grealish in the box and the Man City man picked out Watkins at the far post who tapped in the winner.\nRelive the action from Wembley and get all the latest odds and tips for the match right here:\nEngland vs Australia live\nOllie Watkins and Lewis Dunk emerge with credit on England’s audition night against Australia\nEngland defeat Australia 1-0 in an international friendly at Wembley\nLevi Colwill and Eddie Nketiah made Three Lions debuts\n90+3’ FULL-TIME! - England maintain their unbeaten run (ENG 1-0 AUS)\n57’ GOAL! - Watkins taps in Grealish’s pass (ENG 1-0 AUS)\n45’ CHANCE! - Dunk blocks Strain’s shot to keep things level (ENG 0-0 AUS)\n30’ CHANCE! - Watkins’ effort is cleared off the line (ENG 0-0 AUS)\n21’ CLOSE! - Duke’s volley goes wide from inside the box (ENG 0-0 AUS)\n12’ SAVE! - Johnstone called into action from long range (ENG 0-0 AUS)\nOllie Watkins and Lewis Dunk emerge with credit on England’s audition night against Australia\n22:17 , Mike Jones\nOn a night billed as an audition for England’s fringe players, with only five more games before Gareth Southgate names his Euro 2024 squad, Ollie Watkins and Lewis Dunk were the two who emerged with credit from this unconvincing 1-0 friendly win over Australia.\nWatkins tapped in the winning goal just before the hour to push his claim for a role as poacher; Dunk had earlier prevented a certain goal at the other end and is emerging as a much-needed new character in central defence to partner John Stones. But elsewhere there were some fluffed lines, and perhaps Gareth Southgate’s main learning was that for all the quality in their ranks, England are not quite the same without Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham and their handful of leading lights.\nLevi Colwill was understandably nervous on his Egnalnd debut and conceded possession too easily. Trent Alexander-Arnold had limited impact in his hybrid fullback-midifeld role. And it was a rough night for Jordan Henderson, England’s captain, who had little effect on the match and left the pitch after an hour to loud boos around Wembley. It was certainly jarring to see “Al-Ettifaq” on the teamsheet beside his name, and England fans presumably don’t buy his claim that he moved to Saudi Arabia to grow the game and change attitudes from the inside.\nWatkins and Dunk emerge with credit on England’s audition night against Australia\nFT England 1-0 Australia\n22:14 , Mike Jones\nEngland goalscorer Ollie Watkins on BBC Radio 5 Live: “Obviously we didn’t make it easy for ourselves, but it’s the first time for us all playing together. Not many of us have a lot of caps. There were only a few with more experience and in the squad recently.\n“It was tough and Australia played well and they didn’t make it easy for us. But you want games like that, you want a real challenge. An all-round good night.\n“They’re the best ones, the tap-ins, I’ll take it all day. At the end of the day it says your name on the Sky Sports app, and that’s all that matters so I’ll take it.\n“Whenever I have had the opportunity in an England shirt I have done well. I know I can play at the highest level with these players. Whenever I go on the field I just try and do that.”\nOllie Watkins gives England win over Australia as Jordan Henderson booed\n22:12 , Mike Jones\nJordan Henderson was booed by some England fans on a night when Ollie Watkins helped Gareth Southgate’s much-changed side secure an unconvincing 1-0 win against Australia.\nA sold-out Wembley crowd watched a surprisingly hard-fought friendly between these great sporting rivals on Friday night as the hosts experimented with Euro 2024 in mind.\nEngland can wrap up qualification against Italy on Tuesday night and Watkins boosted his chances of being on the plane to Germany with a goal and solid display.\nOllie Watkins gives England win over Australia as Jordan Henderson booed\nFT England 1-0 Australia\n22:08 , Mike Jones\nOllie Watkins has scored in consecutive England appearances, with these coming 563 days apart. It’s the biggest gap between consecutive scoring appearances for the Three Lions since Mike O’Grady between 1962 and 1969 (2,335 days).\nFT England 1-0 Australia\n22:04 , Mike Jones\nMore from Watkins: “I am playing with top players, I knew I’d get another chance. There was a few times before I got called up and didn’t think I deserved it but now I am coming in confident in myself off the back of good form.\n“I was not nervous and just tried to perform in front of all these fans. I scored, it was a good night. There’s so many good forwards around scoring goals and it is about taking your opportunity when you are on the pitch.\n“It was a tough game. A lot of us haven’t played together before. We got the goal and saw it out. There’s obviously a lot to work on.”\nFT England 1-0 Australia\n21:58 , Mike Jones\nReaction from England goal scorer Ollie Watkins, who spoke to Channel 4: “It is always an honour putting on this shirt. It has been a long time coming.\n“I have been waiting a long time for the next call up. I was looking forward to it and I wasn’t going to let this opportunity slip.\n“Jack [Grealish] has gone to shoot and he has dragged it. I don’t known if it was going in, my first thought it was going in and I took it off him. I was looking at him and saying ‘not sure if it was going in’.”\nFT England 1-0 Australia\n21:51 , Mike Jones\nFormer England goalkeeper, Paul Robinson, speaking on BBC 5Live:\n“Let’s be frank, it was a really poor watch. There was no tempo to the game, or cutting edge. There was nothing in the final third.\n“These are the exciting players, James Maddison, Jarrod Bowen, Ollie Watkins who got the goal, but nobody really shone tonight.\n“It was disjointed, there was no cohesions.”\nFT England 1-0 Australia\n21:49 , Mike Jones\nWe’ll see who, if any, of the starting XI also line-up for the match against Italy on Tuesday night. Trent Alexander-Arnold was very good, James Maddison controlled much of England’s attacking play and Lewis Dunk had another solid night in central defence.\nFull-time! England 1-0 Australia\n21:39 , Mike Jones\n90+3 mins: There goes the whistle. England’s much changed and inexperienced line-up get the job done against Australia in a far from vintage performance.\nOllie Watkins’ goal is the difference at Wembley and Gareth Southgate will have learned some valuable lessons about the next group of players coming through the ranks.\nAustralia made it a tough game for the Three Lions but in the end the hosts get over the line.\nEngland 1-0 Australia\n21:37 , Mike Jones\n90 mins: Three minutes of added time to play at Wembley.\nEngland 1-0 Australia\n21:33 , Mike Jones\n87 mins: A looping corner ball is sent into the penalty area by Australia and it’s won in the air but a gold shirt. The ball is nodded towards goal but Sam Johnstone drops to his right and palms the ball away before Phil Foden runs it clear.\nEngland 1-0 Australia\n21:31 , Mike Jones\n84 mins: Australia make a double change with Awer Mabil and Aziz Behich on for Kye Rowles and Martin Boyle.\nEngland 1-0 Australia\n21:26 , Mike Jones\n81 mins: Martin Boyle curls a corner ball into the middle of the box and finds Connor Metcalfe. He gets a free header but misses the target and the chance goes begging for Australia to equalise.\nEngland 1-0 Australia\n21:24 , Mike Jones\n78 mins: Jackson Irvine isn’t happy that England are awarded a throw in and gives the referee a few verbals. She pulls out a yellow card and books the Australian midfielder for dissent.\nEngland 1-0 Australia\n21:20 , Mike Jones\n75 mins: More changes from Gareth Southgate. Phil Foden replaces James Maddison and Ollie Watkins heads off to be replaced with Eddie Nketiah who makes his England debut.\nEngland 1-0 Australia\n21:18 , Mike Jones\n72 mins: Close! Kalvin Phillips moves the ball out wide to Kieran Trippier who slips it forward for Jarrod Bowen. Bowen then hooks a cross into the middle of the box where James Maddison sticks out his right leg.\nHe tries to turn the ball towards goal but misses it and Australia work the ball clear.\nEngland 1-0 Australia\n21:15 , Mike Jones\n69 mins: Craig Goodwin pulls the ball into the middle of the pitch as Australia stride forward. He sends it to Keanu Baccus who fizzes a shot at goal from range and pulls it wide of the far post.\nEngland 1-0 Australia\n21:11 , Mike Jones\n66 mins: James Maddison’s corner drops to Ollie Watkins who shoots and sees the effort deflected. Trent Alexander-Arnold recovers the ball, nips into the box and shoots himself but his shot is also blocked and bounces out of play.\nEngland 1-0 Australia\n21:10 , Mike Jones\n63 mins: England’s four substitutes have more international caps than the total amount from the starting XI. Gareth Southgate is bringing on the experience to try and close out this match.\nMarcus Rashford takes on Ryan Strain with his first real involvement in the game and wins England a corner.\nEngland 1-0 Australia\n21:07 , Mike Jones\n60 mins: At the hour mark, Gareth Southgate makes quadruple change for England.\nMarcus Rashford, Kieran Trippier, Kalvin Phillips and John Stones all come on to replace Conor Gallagher, Jordan Henderson, Fikayo Tomori and Jack Grealish.\nGOAL! England 1-0 Australia (Watkins, 57’)⚽️\n21:04 , Mike Jones\n57 mins: What do I know?\nJames Maddison whips free kick into the box that gets headed back out to Trent Alexander-Arnold. He delivers a simple cross back into the middle and finds Jack Grealish.\nGrealish sends the ball to the far post inside the six-yard area where Ollie Watkins pops up to tap the ball home.\nEngland 0-0 Australia\n21:02 , Mike Jones\n54 mins: England have been more positive since the restart but they’re still not linking very well in the final third. They’ve created very little to threaten Mat Ryan in goal.\nEngland 0-0 Australia\n20:57 , Mike Jones\n51 mins: James Maddison curls a corner ball into the box but Harry Souttar is on hand to nod it away. Trent Alexander-Arnold collects the loose ball and shoots from range.\nHis effort strikes Jack Grealish in the back and the ball deflects wide of the target.\nEngland 0-0 Australia\n20:55 , Mike Jones\n48 mins: Levi Colwill takes hold of the loose bal in the middle of the pitch and drives it forward. He attempts to slip Ollie Watkins into the box but just ends up giving the ball away.\nAustralia transition it to the other end of the pitch nicely and pass the ball out to Craig Goodwin on the left wing. He twists and tricks his way into space before a cross is booted into the stands by Fikayo Tomori.\nSecond half! England 0-0 Australia\n20:51 , Mike Jones\nAustralia get the match back underway. No changes made by Gareth Southgate or Graham Arnold at the break. Will we see the deadlock broken soon?\nHT England 0-0 Australia\n20:45 , Mike Jones\nDespite only having 33% of possession in that first half, Australia created seven chances on goal, more than double the amount England had.\nRyan Strain’s effort right at the end of the half was probably the best of those but Lewis Dunk came to the rescue.\nHT England 0-0 Australia\n20:40 , Mike Jones\nHalf-time! England 0-0 Australia\n20:35 , Mike Jones\n45+1 mins: The first half comes to an end with things still goalless. Australia have created a few decent chances but the big moments have fallen to Ollie Watkins.\nHe missed an early opportunity to put the Three Lions in front before having another effort cleared off the line. An increase to the tempo of play will work well for Gareth Southgate’s side.\nThere are things to improve after the break.\nEngland 0-0 Australia\n20:33 , Mike Jones\n45 mins: Chance! A threaded pass from Australia sees Martin Boyle played in behind the England line. He holds the ball up on his way into the box before releasing it into space for Ryan Strain.\nStrain takes a touch then shoots but Lewis Dunk gets back in time to make a vital block for the hosts.\nEngland 0-0 Australia\n20:31 , Mike Jones\n42 mins: England’s first corner of the game is knocked short to Trent Alexander-Arnold who whips a first time cross into the box. Jarrod Bowen lunges to get to the ball with a full-length dive and flicks it towards the target with his head.\nThe ball loops into the air and is no trouble for Mat Ryan to cling on to.\nEngland 0-0 Australia\n20:28 , Mike Jones\n39 mins: Ryan Strain joins Conor Gallagher in the book after Jack Grealish works the ball around the full-back and tries to sprint pass. Strain almost wrestles him to the ground and it’s a clear booking.\nJames Maddison curls the free kick into the box but Harry Souttar is on hand to flick the ball to safety.\nEngland 0-0 Australia\n20:25 , Mike Jones\n36 mins: A switch of play from the Socceroos sees the ball come over to Martin Boyle who brings the ball down and quickly shimmies into the penalty area.\nBoyle checks to the right and shoots but can’t control the effort sending it wide of the target.\nEngland 0-0 Australia\n20:23 , Mike Jones\n33 mins: Conor Gallagher gets outmuscled by Craig Goodwin who drives Australia towards the England box. Trying to recover, Gallagher leaps into a tackle and brings down the man earning himself a yellow card in the process.\nThe resultant free kick is flicked into the penalty area but Sam Johnstone comes out to claim the ball confidently enough.\nEngland 0-0 Australia\n20:18 , Mike Jones\n30 mins: Chance! England should be one up. Jack Grealish offloads the ball to James Maddison who threads it through the Australian defence with perfection.\nOllie Watkins is the willing runner. He collects the ball and shifts it around Mat Ryan. There’s an open goal ahead of him and Watkins turns the ball towards goal only for his slowly rolling shot to get cleared off the line!\nEngland 0-0 Australia\n20:16 , Mike Jones\n27 mins: Fikayo Tomori clears a throw in from inside the box and nods the ball behind for a corner. Martin Boyle swings the set piece into the middle but the first ball is dealt with well.\nAustralia recycle the loose ball and Lewis Dunk’s header is knocked down to Craig Goodwin. He takes a snapshot and just lifts the effort over the top!\nEngland 0-0 Australia\n20:13 , Mike Jones\n24 mins: Oh wow. Levi Colwill slips the ball down the line to Jack Grealish who works it forward for James Maddison cutting across from a central position.\nMaddison takes control of the ball, nips into the box then totally miscues his shot and spoons the ball out of play.\nEngland 0-0 Australia\n20:09 , Mike Jones\n21 mins: Close! Australia look the more likely team to score here. Martin Boyle brings the ball down the right channel and flicks a lovely cross into the box.\nMitchell Duke meets the ball on the volley and smokes his effort just wide of the far post!\nEngland 0-0 Australia\n20:06 , Mike Jones\n18 mins: Kye Rowles takes a knock an needs a bit of treatment for the left side of his face. Australia are down to 10-men for the time being as the defender gets a lot of strapping taped around his head.\nEngland press their advantage but can’t find a way through. Jack Grealish is dispossessed inside the box by Harry Souttar who clears his lines.\nEngland 0-0 Australia\n20:04 , Mike Jones\n15 mins: The rain is pouring down at Wembley adding an extra dimension to the game with the ball skipping across the turf.

England are slow to close down the ball inside their own final third as Australia come forward down the left wing. The ball is given to Keanu Baccus who blazes a shot at goal from a long way out.\nHe hits it well and forces Sam Johnstone into a leaping stop to his left, the goalkeeper palming the ball wide of the goal.\nEngland 0-0 Australia\n19:59 , Mike Jones\n9 mins: Ollie Watkins will be disappointed about that missed chance. He had a great opportunity to send England in front but couldm’t shift his feet in time.\nTrying to oust Harry Kane as striker is a difficult task and he needs to be taking those chances.\nEngland 0-0 Australia\n19:56 , Mike Jones\n6 mins: England look to be slowly building themselves into the game as this new look line-up attempts to gel with each other.\nClose! Jarrod Bowen and Conor Gallagher combine brilliantly on the right wing to slip Gallagher into the box. He passes it across the six-yard box where James Maddison lunges for the ball.\nHe misses it and the loose ball skips through Ollie Watkins’ legs before Australia scramble it away.\nEngland 0-0 Australia\n19:51 , Mike Jones\n3 mins: Australia collect the ball and work it over to the right side of the pitch where they win a couple of throw ins. The second is sent into the box but is dealt with by Trent Alexander-Arnold.\nEngland are on the back foot here.\nKick off! England 0-0 Australia\n19:48 , Mike Jones\nJordan Henderson kicks off the match and England work the ball over to the right wing. Ollie Watkins tries to win the aerial ball and takes an elbow to the cheek in the process.\nEngland vs Australia\n19:41 , Mike Jones\nHere come the teams.\nThe players make their way out of the tunnel and onto the pitch and Wembley. Gareth Southgate has named a team that lacks some international experience.\nHow will they cope against Australia tonight?\nKick off is up next...\nEngland vs Australia\n19:40 , Mike Jones\nEngland have only lost one of their seven previous matches against Australia (four wins, two draws) - a 3-1 defeat at Upton Park in February 2003 with Francis Jeffers scoring in his only cap and Wayne Rooney making his debut that game.\nThis is the first meeting between England and Australia since May 2016 in a friendly at the Stadium of Light, won 2-1 by England with goals from Marcus Rashford and Wayne Rooney.\nEngland vs Australia\n19:35 , Mike Jones\nEngland have scored 19 goals in six games in 2023 (3.2 per game), only three fewer than they scored in 13 games in 2022 (22).\nIt’s currently only the second year in the last 60 years that England are averaging three or more goals per game, along with 2019 (38 goals in ten games, 3.8 per game).\nEngland vs Australia\n19:30 , Mike Jones\nHarry Kane has scored 22 goals in 31 England appearances at Wembley, just one behind the record for goals scored at the national stadium for the Three Lions, set by Bobby Charlton, who scored 23 times in 44 games there between 1958 and 1970.\nBoth Kane (Bayern Munich) and Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid) scored in England’s last game against Scotland, but only one player has netted at Wembley this century while playing for a non-English team, with Jadon Sancho doing so in November 2020 against the Republic of Ireland while playing for Borussia Dortmund.\nHarry Kane: ‘Ronaldo and Messi got better after 30 – my career is only at half-time’\n19:25 , Mike Jones\nHarry Kane doesn’t drink. He enjoyed Bayern Munich’s annual trip to Oktoberfest in full lederhosen and ate a giant pretzel, but his jug of beer was barely touched. At the hotel where he lives, meals are carefully planned by his chef: breakfast is an omelette or yoghurt and granola; lunch and dinner consists of salad and vegetables topped off by a rotating carousel of white fish, chicken or beef. Sometimes he has salmon as a treat.\nHe lives away from his wife and children, in a country where he does not speak the language after only a handful of lessons, in a city he cannot enjoy without being mobbed. His family will move over but for now it is a solitary, unremitting existence: eat, sleep, play, recover, repeat. It is not quite the life of a monk, but when children dream of becoming England captain, they probably don’t dream of this.\nHarry Kane: ‘Ronaldo and Messi got better after 30 – my career is only at half-time’\nGrealish on winning an international trophy\n19:20 , Mike Jones\nEngland midfielder Jack Grealish hopes he can add an international trophy to go with the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League he won last year with Manchester City.\n\"I don’t mean this to sound weird but it is difficult in a way because you have such a high of winning the treble and then you do think ‘what would ever top that?’\" he said.\n\"Obviously doing something at international level definitely would.\"\nEngland vs Australia\n19:15 , Mike Jones\nAustralia have won one of their last five games in all competitions (one draw, three defeats), after having won four of their five games before this run (one loss).\nThey’ve shipped nine goals in these five games, as many as in their previous 10 combined.\nEngland vs Australia\n19:10 , Mike Jones\nLewis Dunk earned his second England cap against Scotland in September, four years and 301 days after his first cap against the USA in November 2018.\nIt is the biggest gap between a player’s first two starts for England since Frank Lampard Sr. between October 1972 and May 1980 (7 years, 233 days).\nEngland have won every single game when a Brighton player has featured (9/9), the most games to have featured a player from a specific club with the Three Lions winning every game.\nCardiff, Glasgow, Dublin... The Euro 2028 final should be staged anywhere but Wembley\n19:05 , Mike Jones\nYou already know where the Euro 2028 final will be played. You don’t know know because it hasn’t been announced yet. But when I tell you that the UK and Ireland are hosting the tournament, and when I show you the list of 10 allocated venues, then you already know.\nWembley is the biggest stadium in the best-connected city of the largest host nation. It is the greatest revenue generator. It is the sort of stadium that assumes it will host a final, the sort that thinks other venues wouldn’t want all that pressure and attention anyway.\nThe English FA will pull rank here and that is understandable, to an extent. After all, Wembley can call upon history and experience, the site having hosted three European Championship finals before: one at the old Wembley in 1996, and both the men’s and women’s finals at the new Wembley in 2021 and 2022.\nCardiff, Glasgow, Dublin... The Euro 2028 final should be staged anywhere but Wembley\nEngland vs Australia\n19:00 , Mike Jones\nEngland are unbeaten in their last 17 games in all competitions at Wembley, with 13 wins and four draws, since a 1-0 defeat to Denmark in October 2020.\nIt is their best unbeaten run there since going 24 without defeat between September 1984 and May 1990.\nEngland vs Australia\n18:55 , Mike Jones\nGareth Southgate said tonight’s match with Australia renews \"one of the great sporting rivalries\" and England must take the Socceroos seriously.\n\"Our mindset has got to be spot on,” he added, “Equally, we’ve still got a bit of work to do to qualify for a European Championship.\n\"We have good players and we need to give people opportunities to show what they can do.\"\nEngland vs Australia\n18:51 , Mike Jones\nGareth Southgate has named a new look starting XI. Sam Johnstone starts in goal with Levi Colwill making his England debut while Ollie Watkins and Jarrod Bowen start in the forward line.\nEngland vs Australia line-ups\n18:46 , Mike Jones\nEngland XI: Johnstone, Alexander-Arnold, Tomori, Dunk, Colwill, Gallagher, Henderson, Maddison, Bowen, Watkins, Grealish\nYour #ThreeLions starting tonight! 💪 pic.twitter.com/1olbk0hfry\n— England (@England) October 13, 2023\nAustralia XI: Ryan, Strain, Souttar, Burgess, Rowles, Baccus, Irvine, Metcalfe, Boyle, Duke, Goodwin\n📋 Our Starting XI to take on England at Wembley! 🦁\n🏴 v 🇦🇺 - 14.10.23 - 5:45am AEDT\n📱💻📺 Live on Channel 10, Paramount+, 10 Play#Socceroos #ENGvAUS pic.twitter.com/0R3a2gRvSr— Subway Socceroos (@Socceroos) October 13, 2023\nEngland vs Australia\n18:40 , Mike Jones\nAustralia are underdogs on Friday having beaten England only once in seven meetings, a 3-1 victory at Upton Park in 2003.\nTheir most recent meeting saw them lose 2-1 at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland in 2016.\nFA slammed over decision not to light up Wembley in Israel flag colours\n18:35 , Mike Jones\nThe Football Association has been criticised by Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer for the “extremely disappointing” decision not to light up the Wembley arch in the colours of the Israeli flag before Friday’s friendly between England and Australia.\nFollowing attacks by Hamas militants on the country’s territory last weekend, the British Government had written to UK sports bodies encouraging them to mark events in Israel appropriately.\nThe Hamas attacks have led to the Israeli government responding with airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, with a ground invasion also reported to be a possibility.\nFA slammed over decision not to light up Wembley in Israel flag colours\nFA announces how it is acknowledging the conflicts in Israel and Palestine\n18:30 , Mike Jones\nThe FA has released a statement announcing how they are going to acknowledge the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine which has been in the news this week.\nThe statement reads: “On Friday evening, we will remember the innocent victims of the devastating events in Israel and Palestine.\n“Our thoughts are with them, and their families and friends in England and Australia and with all the communities who are affected by this ongoing conflict. We stand for humanity and an end to the death, violence, fear and suffering.\n“England and Australia players will wear black armbands during their match at Wembley Stadium and there will also be a period of silence held before kick off.\n“Following discussions with partners and external stakeholders, we will only permit flags, replica kits and other representations of nationality for the competing nations inside Wembley Stadium for the upcoming matches against Australia [13 Oct] and Italy [17 Oct].\n“The British Red Cross have also launched an emergency appeal to support the people affected by the humanitarian crisis in the region, and we will promote this appeal within the stadium on Friday.”\nEngland’s Ollie Watkins: ‘I used to shop in Sainsbury’s ... then I came to Aston Villa and I couldn’t’\n18:25 , Mike Jones\nOllie Watkins is the man of the moment: seven goals and four assists this season in a free-flowing Aston Villa side, including a recent hat-trick against Brighton in front of Gareth Southgate, meant it wasn’t a surprise when he was called up to play for England last week, 18 months after his last cap.\nExcept that three weeks ago, he wasn’t the man at all. He still hadn’t scored in the Premier League. He was struggling to take chances and he was getting some stick, which is why he celebrated his first league goal of the season, against Chelsea in late September, with his fingers in his ears. Zoom out and his form has been exceptional for a year, but criticism is never far away.\n“I think all fans are quite fickle,” Watkins says. “If you go a few games without a goal, people will be saying, ‘he’s on a drought, he can’t score’. Then I score four goals in two games and everyone kind of loves you.”\nOllie Watkins: ‘I used to shop in Sainsbury’s ...
