Gareth Southgate's side accumulated only five points from group games against Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia, while they appeared to be heading out at the last-16 stage when they trailed Slovakia 1-0.\nBut a 95th-minute overhead kick from Madrid's Jude Bellingham sent that tie to extra-time, where Harry Kane popped up with the winner. Following that, Bukayo Saka scored a late equaliser in their quarter-final with Switzerland and England managed to triumph on penalties.\nEngland finally put in a positive performance in their semi-final against the Netherlands, but needed a 90th-minute winner from Watkins to book their spot in Berlin.\nSpeaking at a press conference, Watkins drew comparisons with Madrid, who have won several Champions Leagues in recent years despite not always playing the best football in the competition.\n\"If it was related to club football, you see someone like Real in a Champions League game, they are comfortable without the ball, they have that confidence that when they get the ball, they are going to score,\" Watkins said.\n\"I feel like it is the same here. We are hard to beat, and then we just need that one chance and we can win the game. It doesn’t matter if we are playing poorly or if players are having an off day, we still have that world-class talent where we can pop up and get that goal.\"",
