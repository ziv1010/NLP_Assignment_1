Even with the clauses it’s never easy, they have to talk.”\nPrior to Wednesday’s 5-2 win against Leicester in the fourth round of the League Cup, United had won just one of their past eight games in all competitions.\nTen Hag won the League Cup and FA Cup during his spell at Old Trafford but the club have not won the Premier League since 2013, in Alex Ferguson’s last season in charge.\nFerguson won the Premier League title 13 times but since his departure, five permanent managers have come and gone without adding to the club’s 20 top-flight titles.\nVan Nistelrooy said Thursday he was “motivated” to help turn United’s season around and wants to stay at the club as he prepares the players for a high-profile match against Chelsea on Sunday.\nAmorim, a former Portugal midfielder, started his managerial career with then third-tier Casa Pia in 2018 before a switch to Braga.\nSporting swooped in 2020 and he won the club’s first league title in 19 years in his first full season in charge, repeating the feat last season.\nSeen as one of the rising stars on the European coaching scene, he was linked with the manager’s role at Liverpool once Jurgen Klopp announced he was leaving but Dutch coach Arne Slot headed to Anfield instead.\nAmorim held talks with West Ham earlier this year before they appointed former Spain coach Julen Lopetegui to replace David Moyes.\nAFP\nRelated Posts\nShort URL: https://www.africanexaminer.com/?p=98792",
