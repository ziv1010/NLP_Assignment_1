Manager Mikel Arteta struggled to defend his team afterwards, who showed very little attacking intent across the 90 minutes.\nBut with Arsenal looking towards an Aston Villa star who as many as 40 clubs covet, Arteta might be about to fix a long-held issue with his side.\nArsenal look to Jhon Duran to unlock potential in front of goal\nArsenal have long been linked with a striker to support first-choice No.9 Kai Havertz up front. Dusan Vlahovic was the latest to be linked this week, while Florian Wirtz has been touted as a multifunctional forward to join the frontline.\nNow, however, Colombian outlet AS has revealed Arteta's interest in Villa superstar, Jhon Duran, with Sport Witness claiming Arsenal have “made contact” over the signing.\nDuran has made his name this season as a super-sub for Emery, enjoying a purple patch that saw him score against Bayern Munich in the Champions League earlier this season. More often than not, Duran has replaced Ollie Watkins in the centre-forward pairing, rather than Morgan Rogers, who has also produced sparkling form this campaign.\nWith the 20-year-old Duran emerging as one of the standout young forwards in the division, Arsenal's proposal is intriguing. FourFourTwo understands that Arteta still values Havertz as an attacking midfielder who could play behind another conventional No.9.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nRanked at no.9 in FourFourTwo's list of the best strikers in the world right now, Havertz has been a palpable hit at the Emirates Stadium – but Arsenal have lacked a clinical edge in front of goal at times.\nDuran would certainly give them that, but in FourFourTwo's opinion, this move is a non-starter for a number of reasons.\nVIDEO Why Chelsea Couldn't Handle Liverpool's Curtis Jones\nThe report states that Villa have set Duran's asking price at €85-90 million – which is far more than Arsenal would likely be willing to pay for a player who is still relatively unproven.\nDuran is still very young. Arteta has seemed hesitant to spend big, unless it's on talent with a consistent and obvious track record, eschewing the option to sign Alexander Isak while at Real Sociedad while signing the likes of Havertz and Declan Rice for big fees. There's no indication that Villa would even sell Duran, either, given that he's become a key part of Unai Emery's plans and is playing Champions League football in the Midlands right now.\nThe Colombian is worth €35m, as per Transfermarkt. His contract runs until 2030.\nMark White has been at on FourFourTwo since joining in January 2020, first as a staff writer before becoming content editor in 2023.
