  "body_text": "Ferencváros have confirmed the signing of Republic of Ireland international Callum O’Dowda from Cardiff City. The 30-year-old left-sided midfielder will link up with Robbie Keane’s squad ahead of the Hungarian champions’ European Cup qualifier on July 22. O’Dowda is the Hungarian champions’ seventh signing of the summer and he is the first Irish player to join the club since Keane took over the club in January. He joins the Hungarian champions after Cardiff finished bottom of the Championship last season. O’Dowda has 32 caps for Ireland, scoring one goal, and had spent nine seasons in the Championship, for Cardiff and previously for Bristol City. He is a grandson of former Irish tenor Brendan O’Dowda, who hailed from Dundalk.\nAlso Ireland winger Mikey Johnston was reported to be in process of completing a shock move to Brazilian club Flamengo from West Bromwich Albion for about £5 million, according to the reports in Birmingham. But the deal is off or at least stalled for now, reportedly because of negative fan reaction.\nThe winger scored two goals in 40 Championship games for the West Midlands team last season, and has won 15 caps for the Republic of Ireland. Flamengo are one of the biggest teams in Brazil and recently beat Chelsea in the group stage of the Club World Cup.\nDEATH OF LIVERPOOL\nSTAR DIOGO JOTA, 28\nLiverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota died in a car crash in Spain last Thursday. Jota, who was 28 and his 25-year-old brother Andre Silva, both died after the Lamborghini they were travelling in crashed in the Spanish province of Zamora. The player was on his way back to Liverpool for pre-season training, making the trip by car and ferry because he had undergone minor surgery and doctors advised him against flying. Jota married his long-term partner Rute Cardoso, with whom he had three children, just 11 days before the fatal crash. Liverpool said Jota's death is a ‘‘tragedy that transcends’’ the club, while fans gathered outside Anfield to lay tributes. Reds manager Arne Slot said Jota was ‘‘the essence of what a Liverpool player should be.’’ The brothers were buried in Gondomar in northern Portugal on Saturday with the current Liverpool players and some former players, like Caoimhin Kelleher, in attendance. Journalists, including those in the New York Times’ subscription-based the Athletic, wrote after that the man, who was not considered a future star when he was a youth, was unfailingly humble and friendly, and they remembered him as a footballer always available to chat, which was helped by the fact that he had perfect English when he first arrived to play for Wolves, his first club in the Premier League.\nFERGUSON PRICED AT\n£28M BY BRIGHTON\nIt was reported last week that Brighton would accept a £28 million fee for Irish international Evan Ferguson after the striker’s unsuccessful loan spell at West Ham last season. That would be a significant dip on his €65 million valuation after scoring a hat-trick against Newcastle United in September 2023, when he was 18. Serious knee and ankle injuries in the past two seasons have stalled the progress of young man from Bettystown in County Louth, who has scored five goals in 22 appearances for Ireland. Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler showed little interest in waiting for Ferguson to regain fitness or form last season, starting him once before the January loan to West Ham, where he also started just one game. Despite singing a contract in November 2023 that has him attached to the Seagulls until June 2029, the arrival of Greek teenager Charalampos Kostoulas for €35 million appears to be edging Ferguson out of the club that signed him from Bohemians in 2021.\nGILES RETIRES\nFROM RADIO\nLegendary player and manager John Giles, aka Johnny Giles, is retiring as a pundit from Newstalk after 23 years with the Dublin-based station. Giles was a brilliant footballer with the great Leeds United team of the 1960s and ‘70s. Manager Don Revie signed the 22-year-old Giles from Manchester United in 1963, not long after he’d won an F.A. Cup medal. Revie had wanted Giles to succeed him at Leeds in 1974, but that didn’t happen, and he got a job as player manager with West Bromwich Albion in 1975, bringing the club back up to the First Division in his first season in charge and securing a seventh place finish the following season. He had already been player-manager of the Republic of Ireland team since 1973 and would continue in that role until 1980, having gotten the first of his 59 caps in 1959.\nGiles was player-manager of Shamrock Rovers from 1977 to 1983, with off-season spells at Philadelphia Fury and Vancouver Whitecaps during those years. Giles ended his managerial career with a second stint back at WBA in the mid-1980s.\nWhile he wasn’t a media-friendly manager, the Dubliner’s media career blossomed when his good friend Eamon Dunphy recommended him to an RTE Television producer. Over the course of his time with the national broadcaster, Giles was a quarter of an iconic panel alongside presenter the late Bill O’Herlihy and fellow panelists Dunphy and Liam Brady. Giles was an ever-present on the RTE panel from the Republic’s breakthrough at Euro ‘88 right up until Euro 2016. That remains the last major international tournament that the Republic of Ireland men’s team have played in. He left RTE in 2016 when his contract was not renewed. However, Giles continued working for Newstalk Radio station, which he joined upon its inception. Newstalk have announced that they will host a night of celebration in Giles’s honor in Dublin’s Sugar Club on Aug. 14.\nCAMPBELL RE-SIGNS\nWITH LURGAN CELTIC\nArmagh footballer Stefan Campbell signed for his local soccer club Lurgan Celtic just 24 hours after seeing his county go out of the All-Ireland championship in the quarter-final against Kerry. Campbell, who came on a second-half sub in Armagh’s All-Ireland final win over Galway last year, didn’t play against Kerry on June 29 as his currently nursing a hand injury. This will be Campbell’s fourth spell with Lurgan. Lurgan Celtic manager Niall Lavery, said: ‘‘What a player. I played alongside Soupy for long enough to see what he can do. A leader in any changing room. He will add pace, power, goals and all-round quality to the team. Can’t wait to see Stefan back and scoring goals.’’\nHAMMERS DO DEAL\nWITH BOYLE SPORTS\nEPL club West Ham United have announced a multi-year principal partnership with Boyle Sports, Ireland’s largest independent bookmaker, a move that sees the betting firm become the Hammers’ new front-of-shirt sponsor for the 2025-26 season. This landmark agreement marks a pivotal moment for both organizations, signalling a new chapter for the East London club ahead of crucial changes in EPL sponsorship regulations starting in the 2026-27 season. Rival bookmakers like William Hill and Ladbrokes, have been closing their shops in the UK and focusing on the U.S. and on online platforms. Boyle Sports, who will replace Betway as the Hammers main sponsors, don’t have a huge presence in East London and there is speculation that they will have one “super shop’”in London in the style of Nike or Apple, rather than a series of kiosks around the city. This timing is critical, as it precedes the EPL’s impending ban on gambling firms appearing as front-of-shirt sponsors, set to take effect from the 2026-27 season. From the 2026-27 season the company’s name will switch to the shirt sleeves. Founded by John Boyle the chain opened its first shop in Markethill, Co. Armagh in 1982. The company now has 390 outlets, with 70 of them in Britain.\nRETIRED EVANS LANDS\nNEW JOB WITH UNITED\nFormer Northern Ireland and Manchester United defender Jonny Evans has been handed the task of helping to progress the careers of the United’s young players after confirming his retirement as a player. The 37-year-old, who won the Champions League, three EPL titles, the FA Cup and two League Cups during his two stints at Old Trafford, has been appointed head of loans and pathways at Old Trafford. Evans’ role will see him work closely with director of football Jason Wilcox and the director of academy to ease developing talent into the first team.\nMOUSSET EXITS\nBohemians have confirmed the departure of former Premier League striker Lys Mousset. The 28-year-old from Montivilliers in France had played over 90 games in England’s top flight with Bournemouth and Sheffield United before his career fell into a downward trajectory, ending with spells in France and Germany. He arrived at Dalymount Park following a successful trial, with significant interest and intrigue around the signing given his one-time price tag of €13 million when joining the Blades from Bournemouth. Mousset struggled initially as he looked to gain match fitness, having spent a year on the sidelines before joining Bohs. Despite several starts and appearances from the bench, his time with the Gypsies yielded just a single goal when he bagged the winner against Sligo Rovers in May.\nBOHEMIANS ISSUE\nOASIS JERSEY\nBohemians have become almost as well known for their limited edition jerseys than their league performance and it looks like they are guaranteed a sell out with their latest jersey produced for the upcoming FAI campaign which features the logo of the band Oasis. The Gallagher brothers, who have made their peace, will play down the road from Dalymount at Croke Park in August. Des Kelly is Bohs' main sponsor, but the Gypsies have produced several one-off jerseys with, Guinness, and Fontaines D.C. images, which have been huge sellers on-line. All profits from the jersey will be divided between the club itself, which is fan-owned and community-run, and two charities, one of which is in Manchester where the Gallagher boys were born.\nGIANNOTTI SAYS HE\nWILL BE HANDS ON\nNew Athlone Town owner Nick Giannotti has vowed not to be an absentee landlord. The San Diego native and Plymouth Argle director has taken over the struggling League of Ireland first division club through his Redball Energy company. In an open letter to club supporters he said: ‘‘Many of you may be sceptical as I am not local to Athlone, but I can assure you that I am not just another disconnected non-Irish owner. My father emigrated to the United States from Italy through Ellis Island. His story echoes that of so many Irish families who made a new life abroad. My wife, whose has Cork roots, studied at University in Dublin. I am not here to change Athlone’s identity, but to honour it, protect it and to grow it.’’ Giannotti has appointed former Bray Wanderers manager Ian Ryan as manager of the club, who are currently bottom of the first division six points behind Kerry FC.\nWALKER JOINS BURNLEY\nBurnley have signed defender Kyle Walker from Manchester City on a two-year contract. The right-back completed his medical on Friday and will work again with head coach Scott Parker, who he played alongside at Tottenham Hotspur for two seasons. The 35-year-old made 15 appearances in the first half of last season for City before joining AC Milan on loan in January, but the Italian club decided not to make his move permanent. Walker won 17 trophies during his time at Etihad Stadium and was part of the squad that won the Treble in 2023. He signed for City in the summer of 2017 and made 319 appearances for the club. Burnley were promoted back to the EPL last season following their relegation in 2024.\nARSENAL BUY\nSPANISH STAR\nArsenal have completed the signing of Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad in a deal worth almost £60m. The Spain midfielder is the Gunners’ second signing of the summer transfer window, following the arrival of goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga from Chelsea for £5m.The 26-year-old, who rejected an approach from Liverpool last summer, came through the ranks at Real Sociedad before becoming a regular in their first team. The midfielder, who played 236 times for the Spanish club has signed a five-year deal.\nBIG WIN FOR\nDERRY, BOYCE\nLiam Boyce got a hat-trick for Derry City on Friday night as they beat Waterford 7-2 at the Brandywell to move into second place in the Premier Division table. Derry are now just 9 points behind leaders Shamrock Rovers, with two games less played than Rovers, who drew 2-2 away to Sligo Rovers. Former Irish international Joey O’Brien who was confirmed as Shelbourne ‘s permanent replacement for Damien Duff last Thursday, got off to a good start with a 3-1 win over basement club Cork City at Tolka Park on Friday night. Meanwhile St Patrick’s goal drought continues; the Saints scored only one goal in the month of June and July didn’t start any better with a 0-0 home draw against Bohemians.\nLOI results: Derry City 7, Waterford 2; Drogheda 1, Galway 0; St Patrick’s Ath 0, Bohemians 0; Shelbourne 3, Cork City 1; Sligo Rovers 2, Shamrock Rov 2.",
