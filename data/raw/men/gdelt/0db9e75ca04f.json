  "body_text": "Multichoice, a broadcasting firm, raised the rates of its offerings in Nigeria on Wednesday, four months after the previous hike.\nThe corporation conducted a comprehensive evaluation of their package prices. The revised prices will take effect on May 1, 2024.\nThe DStv Premium package now costs N37,000, up from N29,500 before the price rise. Similarly, the DSTV Compact+ package jumped from N19,800 to N25,000, while the Compact package climbed from N12,500 to N15,700.\nThe Comfam package went from N7,400 to N9,300. Yanga package climbed from 4,200 to N5,100, while Padi package increased from 2,950 to N3,600. HDPVR was raised from N4,000 to N5,000, the Access Fees package from N4,000 to N5,000, and XtraView from N4,000 to N5,000.\nMeanwhile, the Gotv Supa+ package has increased from N12,500 to N15,700, the Supa package from N7,600 to N9,600, and the Max package from N5,700 to N7,200.\nThe Jolli package jumped from N3,950 to N4,850, the Jinja package from N2,700 to N3,300, and the Smallie package from N1,300 to N1,575.\nThe upward revision of the television company’s products has elicited varied comments online, with social media users claiming that the increase came at the wrong time.\nIn response to the raise on X, a social media user, Kelvin Odanz, who tweets as @MrOdanz, urged Nigerians to consider other options rather than complaining about the increase.\nHe wrote, “If you can afford stable Internet, there are so many other services you can use aside from DSTV. For football and other entertainment. Because aside football, nothing dey DSTV. Explore these options and stop whining.\n“I am not even a fan of DSTV one bit. Aside from football, there’s basically nothing of note there. But this whole outrage over them hiking their price is quite hypocritical. Everyone has hiked the price of their goods/services. Even small businesses. So why shouldn’t DSTV do same?\nSharing his sentiment, @Letter_to_Jack said, “Electricity tariffs increased: Small rage. Cement prices through the roof: Small rage. Diesel to 1700/L at a point: Small rage. Indomie at 13k = small rage. Dstv increases prices: OUTRAGE! At this point, you’d think DSTV/MultiChoice is the only trigger Nigerians have.”\nOn his part, David Ofor, said while the price increase was understandable, it was important for the broadcasting company to justify it by offering value for the money.\nHe wrote, “I understand the fact that Multichoice is operating in a free market economy, and Govt has limited control mechanism in such. What people are complaining about is not primarily the price hike, but, the static content being provided, DSTV and GoTV have not improved on their services despite the plethora of increments over the years.\n“They should justify the payments made, more so, why are they increasing now that Diesel prices are coming down and Naira is strengthening?”\nWhile the debate continues, PUNCH Online looks at other alternatives Nigerians can consider for their pleasure.\nDSTV\nDespite varied reactions to the rise, many Nigerians would stick with the TV firm. Despite multiple upgrades, Multichoice retains client loyalty amid other options providing the same services.\nMany homes prefer DStv and GOtv for entertainment. This could be related to the company’s focus on international sports coverage, particularly European leagues and the UEFA Champions League.\nWhen reached on Friday, Multichoice Nigeria spokesperson Caroline Oghuma stated that, despite the raise, members can keep their existing price for the next year thanks to a “Price Lock” incentive.\n“With Price Lock, you can continue to pay your current subscription for up to a year, if you pay before your due date, each month,” Oghuma told our correspondent.\nStar Times\nThe firm, a prominent player in the Asian Pay-TV market, has a significant market presence in several African nations, including Nigeria and Kenya.\nStartimes has news, music, and movie channels, as well as exclusive rights to some football material.\nThe business just acquired non-exclusive broadcast rights to the Spanish top flight leagues, LaLiga EA Sports and LaLiga Hypermotion, for the next five seasons.\nLa Liga EA Sports is Spain’s elite football league, and it is regarded as one of the world’s top professional leagues, with 20 teams.\nSLTV\nSLTV is a leading satellite television business headquartered in Nigeria. Metro Digital Limited operates this direct-to-home satellite television platform.\nMetro Digital SLTV features over 50 HD channels, including 10 Sports stations that broadcast live football matches from the Premier League, Champions League, La Liga, Seria A, and UEL, among others, with monthly subscriptions ranging from N5,000 to N2,500.\n“SLTV’s goal is to bring premium digital TV content to homes, including sports, entertainment, and news, at reasonable costs.\n“SLTV is a customer-focused organization, and we do everything possible to ensure that all of our customers are satisfied,” the company stated on its website.\nAndroid TV Box\nAndroid TV Box is a piece of entertainment equipment that connects to a television and lets you to watch your favorite movies, videos, series, live TV shows, and games.\nThese versatile gadgets can broadcast material to your TV, play locally stored files, video games, and much more.
