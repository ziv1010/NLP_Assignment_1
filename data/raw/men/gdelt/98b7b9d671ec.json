  "body_text": "Letters to The Mag – Newcastle United fans have had their say\nThe opinions continue to flow into The Mag, as Newcastle United fans debate the various issues affecting our club.\nWhether it is events on or off the pitch, always plenty to talk about.\nNewcastle United fans with the latest collection of opinions below, plus the odd visitor from elsewhere…\nContributions are sometimes too brief to make up into a full article and so we have gathered up a number of recent comments sent in, relating to issues at Newcastle United (if you would like to send anything in, long or short, then contribute@themag.co.uk is the place):\nDear Mag,\nThoughts from NE6\nSeason highlights –\nThrashing PSG, the mackems, little Tottenham (again), Aston Villa, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Man Utd, Sheffield Utd.\nTaking maximum points off every single London side at St James Park.\nDisappointments –\nThe ridiculous amount of injuries. This really needs to be looked at during the close season.\nOur away form –\nNot a problem last season but losing away to teams like Everton, Luton, Bournemouth and Tottenham is a real let down.\nBallot system for members –\nDoesn’t seem to be the answer but not really sure what is.\nThe cup draws!\nYou couldn’t make it up. Unbelievable Jeff. PSG, Milan, Dortmund, Man City etc. Some good luck next season please.\nMy player of the season –\nAnthony Gordon. A close call between him and ice cold Alex. I think Gordon had a bad press when he came here but he’s a really nice lad as well as a top player.\nSpecial talent –\nFairly obvious one. Lewis Miley. This kid is exceptional. This is the sort of player we must build the club around in the future. Already valued at €22 million on transfermarkt.\nHopes for next season –\nTop four finish and a cup winner. I’d take any of the cups but the Europa League would be nice. Top four next season is a realistic target. Only Man City are streets ahead of us. Arsenal and Aston Villa will be there. Liverpool will be in transition and Man United are a joke.\nTom Laverick\nDear Mag,\nImagine this lot fit…\nImagine if you had the ability to cancel FFP / PSR for one summer transfer window and were given an unlimited transfer budget tomorow for two weeks.\nIn this dream world you could do worse than say buy Nick Pope, Tonali, Botman, Joelinton,Willock, Trippier, Miley.\nThat’s seven legitimate experienced quality premiership players, I reckon total current market value £270m .\nAdd to this in my dream world, with all the constraints removed, that out of contract players are let go and players who have served the club well are moved on. I think this would generate about £50m and reduce the wage bill by about £200,000 per week.\nLet’s multiply by five that £50m and buy a forward and central defender for £250m in this fantasy .\nFor 14 years we used to play this flight of fancy as we watched more turgid football, knowing we were going to sell our best and try at best to stay in the division to sell shirts and tatty adverts in the stadium which looked like a bank holiday sell off at the metro centre.\nI saw a team play badly for 50 minutes yesterday, then wipe the floor with a team like we used to be, having put 13 goals past them this year.\nI know I started with my little fantasy but you know what I bloody well deserve one!\nIn Eddie we trust.\nKeith Dixon\nDear Mag,\nCan somebody please confirm the position NUFC must finish to qualify for the Europa league?\nI ask this question because I was of the belief the red side of Manchester had qualified already by being in the final of the FA Cup.\nThat is, they win and they qualify for the Europa League. But, get beat and as the blue side of Manchester will already be qualified for Champions League football.\nTo explain is to say the runners up then qualify for the Europa League.\nThis would mean NUFC need to finish 5th to qualify for the Europa League.\nTo finish 5th is a big ask, relying on Spurs to drop far too many points than even the most staunch supporter to hope for.\nI say this because I would prefer NUFC to miss out on the Conference part of European football.\nJAM\n(***As we understand it, fifth in Premier League gets Europa League (unless by some miracle Premier League gets one of the two extra Champions League places). Then if Man City win FA Cup, sixth in league gets Europa League and seventh gets Conference. If Man U win FA Cup then they get the second Europa League spot available to English clubs, with then sixth in the Premier League getting the Conference. Happy for anybody to put us right at The Mag if we have got it wrong!)\nDear Mag,\nAshworth contractual gardening leave:\nI don’t think the Ashworth matter will be decided by some ‘third party’, nor necessarily by arbitration.\nArbitration is usually an attempt to avoid a Court settlement when the parties fail to reach an agreement, but may not succeed.\nIf Ashworth has a gardening leave clause in his contract, the Court can settle the matter at its’ discretion by way of an injunction.\nNewcastle will need to show their loss in losing Ashworth to a competitor to justify the length of garden leave in the contract.\nThe Court can order Ashworth not to sign for Man Utd in breach of his contract.\nIt may decide the alleged business loss to Newcastle is excessive, more than adequately covered by the garden leave period, and reduce the period accordingly.\nThis is all at the discretion of the Court.\nJohn Hopkinson\nDear Mag,\nJust got a few queries regarding Gateshead following your article (‘An absolute shocker for our Tyneside neighbours Gateshead’).\nWhy have Gateshead council decided to inform the EFL regarding the tenure lease of Gateshead stadium now? Council had a whole year to do something.\nCoventry FC had the same problem years back, how did they get out of their problem regarding their stadium, as currently they are on a five years lease?\nCould supporters donate money to help save the stadium?\nCould a go help me Gateshead stadium fund be set up for people to donate money to help save Gateshead?\nPut on charity events, with people of influence eh pop singer, footballer etc?\nGet all the players and managers lobby Gateshead council for answers as the team played with all their hearts and souls this season?\nKind Regards\nJenny\nDear Mag,\nSky double standards.\nSpot the difference.\nOn Sky concurrent to each other..\n‘It’s ridiculous, time Newcastle got real about Ashworth £20 million, Man U on a tight budget. Dont believe in this gardening leave and don’t see why he cant go to Man U now… NUFC are being unrealistic.’\n‘Now Adrian Newey – Top F1 designer\nLeaving Red Bull still under contract.\nYes many teams want him, I think a spell of gardening leave incoming unless a sizeable amount of money changes hands…’\nWithin five minutes of each other…\nBoth under contract.\nAshworth approached by Man U in usual just hand him over fashion.\nAwful entitlement\nAnthony Stafford\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
