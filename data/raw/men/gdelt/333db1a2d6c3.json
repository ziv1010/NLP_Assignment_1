  "body_text": "Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez has urged Aaron Ramsdale to leave Arsenal before the transfer deadline.\nRamsdale has not started a Premier League match for Arsenal since March 9, playing back-up to Mikel Arteta signing David Raya.\nThe 26-year-old became Arsenal’s most expensive goalkeeper when he completed a £30m move from Sheffield United in 2021.\nRamsdale initially impressed at the Emirates Stadium, playing every league match as they challenged for the Premier League title in 2022-23.\nBut the England international has seen his game-time drastically cut since Raya’s arrival from Brentford and could leave Arsenal before the summer transfer window closes next week.\nPremier League clubs Wolves and Southampton are interested in signing Ramsdale and ex-Arsenal goalkeeper Martinez believes he should look to move on.\nMartinez left Arsenal in the pursuit of regular football back in 2020 and has found a home at Aston Villa, helping Unai Emery’s side qualify for the Champions League last season.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘It’s a different position to me as Aaron signed for big money,’ Martinez told the Daily Telegraph. ‘He was the No 1 for Arsenal. I never had a chance like that.\n‘When you play every game in the Premier League and, then you drop to the bench with the quality that Aaron has, I think he should find a place to play where he feels loved.\n‘He is a player that England needs in their goalkeeping area. He has a great future.’\nMartinez added to the Daily Mirror: ‘I heard he might go to Wolves, which I think could be a good move for him.’\nFormer Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Petit has also urged Ramsdale to secure a late summer move and says he must ‘very unhappy’ with his current situation.\nMartinez will come up against his former club on Saturday evening when Aston Villa play host to Arsenal.\nVilla, managed by ex-Arsenal boss Unai Emery, did the double over Arsenal last season, with the second defeat during the run-in dealing a huge blow to the Gunners’ title hopes.\nMore Trending\nDespite Aston Villa thriving under Emery and finishing fourth last season, Martinez has dismissed the suggestion the Midlands club could challenge the likes of Arsenal and Manchester City for the Premier League title this season.\n‘Nah,’ the Argentine World Cup winner said. ‘You can see that we sold two or three good players that we had, which Unai didn’t want to do.\n‘I know with PSR [profitability and sustainability rules], they can’t really sign as much as the owner wants. It’s going to be a little bit harder than everyone thinks, so it is a work in progress.\n‘We want to go on a cup run, maybe even win the Carabao Cup or the FA Cup. But there is no way we can challenge for the title.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Erik ten Hag explains why Jadon Sancho was not in Man Utd squad to face Brighton\nMORE: Arsenal made offer for new Chelsea signing but Mikel Arteta now wants Barcelona target\nMORE: Jamie Carragher predicts Man Utd will sign Chelsea star in stunning transfer",
