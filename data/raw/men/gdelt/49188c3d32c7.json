There is a chance Arne Slot chooses the defensive capabilities of Kostas Tsimikas over the attacking output of Andy Robertson.\nIn midfield, Tyler Morton is out injured, while Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai only played one half each at the weekend and will start. Ryan Gravenberch would be in line for his 40th start of the season, but could potentially be rested, as Curtis Jones comes into the side. Harvey Elliott remains an impact substitute at best in the eyes of the manager.\nUp top, Cody Gakpo is fit an available for the first time in two weeks and could start right away, while Luis Diaz played the full match at the weekend and could start on the bench. Darwin Núñez and Diogo Jota duke it out to start in the centre alongside Mohamed Salah.\nWhat the Managers Said\nArne Slot: “We try to win every game, that’s what we tried to do last week – it wasn’t our intention to be defending so deep. We want a different game, though our intentions are the same. We don’t want a draw, we want the ball as much as we can.”\nLuis Enrique: “No player in the team will not want to play at Anfield. It is a legendary stadium in the history of football in Europe. It is a huge motivation for the players and as a team. We want to show that we are capable of playing a good game in Liverpool’s stadium.”\nThe Officials (ROU)\nReferee: István Kovács\nAssistant Referees: Mihai Marica, Ferencz Tunyogi\nFourth Official: Horațiu Feșnic\nVAR: Bastian Dankert (GER), Tomasz Kwiatkowski (POL)\nKickoff is set for 8:00PM GMT/3:00PM ET tomorrow, and television listings for the match can be found on LiveSoccerTV.\nIn the meantime, and as always, we’ll be keeping you updated with all the buildup to the game, including team news as it’s released, our live matchday thread, and post-match recaps from The Liverpool Offside staff.
