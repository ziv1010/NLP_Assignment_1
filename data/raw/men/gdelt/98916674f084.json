  "body_text": "Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has said that he’ll ‘take’ Europa League football next season, even if it wasn’t the objective at the start of the current campaign.\nThe Reds’ recent winning run has given them a faint chance of finishing in the top four and qualifying for the Champions League for the seventh year running.\nHowever, with a gap of seven points to fourth-placed Manchester United – who have a game in hand – a place in Europe’s premier club competition for 2023/24 still seems a tall order for the Merseysiders.\nSpeaking in his press conference this morning ahead of Sunday’s clash against fifth-placed Tottenham, Klopp said (via Paul Gorst on Twitter): “We take what we get (for European qualification). We would not have said Europa League would be fantastic achievement at the start of the season.\n“We want to create the basis to squeeze everything out. We have to be really focused for the game coming up.”\nKlopp: \"We take what we get (for European qualification). We would not have said Europa League would be fantastic achievement at the start of the season. We want to create the basis to squeeze everything out.
