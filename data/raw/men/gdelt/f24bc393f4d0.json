Leila Pereira, president of the Brazilian giants Palmeiras since 2021.\nBased in Sao Paulo, Palmeiras have become renowned for their track record of producing brilliant young talents who secure big moves to European sides — including Endrick at Real Madrid, soon-to-be Chelsea winger Estevao Willian and new Manchester City centre-back Vitor Reis.\nAdvertisement\nIn a 45-minute conversation with The Athletic, Pereira, 61, spoke about being a trailblazer in the game, that impressive production line and why Spain needs to be tougher when fighting racism.\nPereira was born in the municipality of Cambuci in Rio de Janeiro. She studied journalism and law but went into business when she took over credit company Crefisa in 2008. She is also the president of the University Centre of the Americas (FAM) and manages 11 other companies. But her breakthrough in football came relatively recently, arriving at Palmeiras in 2015.\n“My life in football started not so long ago,” she says. “I started at the club as a great sponsor. I was a Palmeiras fan for many years and we joined the club to collaborate.”\nPereira was named the first female president in Palmeiras’ history in 2021 after twice being elected a councillor (a fan representative) by the club’s members and running uncontested for the presidency.\nShe was re-elected last year in the same way and the club have been hugely successful under her reign, with the men’s side winning seven trophies and the women’s side lifting three, including their first Copa Libertadores Femenina (South America’s equivalent of the Champions League) in 2022, and the academy teams claiming a host of titles.\n“It is a very victorious trajectory, for me and for women,” she says. “It is an inspiration for women who want to be in football.”\nWhen she first took charge, Pereira said she had not suffered discrimination in football as a woman. She based her argument on having reached the presidency thanks to votes cast by Palmeiras’ members in becoming a councillor, a large majority of whom are men.\n“But then, as president, I have seen many things that would not have happened if I were a man,” she says. “For example, with social networks, where I am very active, I have had some criticism. I post a lot of things on social media, like many presidents, and they criticise me for that, and I’m sure it’s because I’m a woman.\nAdvertisement\n“They call me a ‘blogger’, they say I want to appear more than the club… but it’s not like that: it’s a means of communication that I have with the fans.”\nPereira addresses those critics with a statement backed by her club’s success: “I’m sorry for those sexist critics who disrespect me, who say that a woman’s place is not in football, that because I’m a woman I don’t understand football… without knowing about football, I won seven titles in three years, something that a man didn’t achieve.\n“Imagine if I understood football.”\nPereira also organised a press conference last year for female journalists only to make a powerful point about women in football.\n“That appeared all over the world,” she says. “Some men complained and I told them: ‘I want you to feel in one hour what we women feel in our whole life’. We don’t want advantages, we want equal opportunities.”\nThe Palmeiras president says she feels respected by managers, players, agents and the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF). She will travel to the Club World Cup in the United States this summer with Palmeiras as the only woman in charge of one of the 32 participating clubs.\n“I’m very proud to be the only woman,” Pereira says, remembering an anecdote from 2022. “We took part in the (old) Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi, in the Middle East, in an extremely sexist country, and there were two women at the top of world football, me as president of Palmeiras and Marina Granovskaia, the director of Chelsea. I said to her, ‘Can you imagine Abu Dhabi, extremely macho, and here we are as two women at the top of world football?’.”\nPereira says that is why she has no problem with Palmeiras playing in Abu Dhabi or Saudi Arabia, which will host the 2034 World Cup and where women’s freedoms are restricted.\n“It would be very interesting (to play in those countries) to show that the place of football is for women,” she says.\nAdvertisement\nPereira is also outspoken on the issue of racism. Vinicius Junior, her fellow Brazilian, has suffered from racist abuse while playing for Real Madrid in stadiums across Spain and the Palmeiras president says the Spanish authorities need to be more forceful.\n“People are seeing what is happening in Spain (with the abuse of Vinicius Jr),” Pereira says. “I don’t know the legislation in Spain and the way the authorities fight this kind of crime, but they have to punish it in an extremely hard way. Without punishment, there will be no end to this type of crime and others. If they really want this to stop, there has to be punishment.”\nThe Athletic has reported that since October 2021, La Liga has reported 24 incidents of racist abuse directed towards Vinicius Junior, including at 10 football grounds in Spain. The league has legally denounced incidents of racism and demanded sanctioning powers that had previously been denied.\nIn June, three people were sentenced to eight months in prison after being found guilty of racially abusing Vinicius Jr in that May 2023 match at Valencia. That was the first conviction for racist insults in a football stadium in Spain.\n“Here in Brazil, racism in legislation is a crime,” she added. “It is inadmissible. We don’t accept racism in any form here. Here we don’t only punish the aggressor, but also the club. We do a lot of campaigns denouncing the aggressors, raising awareness among our fans.”\nThis month, Manchester City signed the 19-year-old centre-back Reis from Palmeiras — the latest gem from the club’s academy. City will pay €37million (£31m; $39m) for the defender, who has played just 22 times for Palmeiras’ first team.\nPereira says Joao Paulo Sampaio, the director of the Palmeiras academy, is the key to the production line that has earned the club €140million plus up to €48.5m in variables since December 2022 for Endrick, Estevao, Luis Guilherme (to West Ham United) and Reis. Yet the four had only made a combined 100 official senior appearances when their moves to Europe were confirmed.\nAdvertisement\n“In recent months, we have received several inquiries from big clubs in Europe for Vitor Reis,” says Pereira. “Initially, we did not intend to negotiate his departure before the Club World Cup. Vitor is a player of great technical quality, with an uncommon maturity for such a young athlete, and he would certainly have helped us a lot to achieve our goals if he had stayed.”\nBut City pushed to make Reis the most expensive Brazilian centre-back to move to Europe, almost doubling the €20m Paris Saint-Germain paid Sao Paulo for Lucas Beraldo last year.\n“They contacted us and presented an extremely interesting proposal, with substantial values,” says Pereira.\n“We rejected the first offer and City, who maintained a very professional conduct throughout the process, reached the value we considered fair to conclude the operation. I could not be irresponsible in rejecting a proposal with such significant figures and, with a heavy heart, we ended up accepting it.”\n“Vitor leaves Palmeiras with a great reputation, he had been there since he was a ‘crianca’ (child in Portuguese),” says his long-time agent, Claudio Fiorito. “Palmeiras is a club whose premise is the complete training of professionals from the ground up, and now Vitor can join one of the biggest institutions in the world.”\nOne Palmeiras wonderkid English fans have yet to see is Estevao, the 17-year-old winger who will join Chelsea this summer after the Club World Cup. Following interest from many European sides, Chelsea agreed a deal last summer worth €45million plus €16.5m in bonuses.\n“Estevao is a spectacle of a player,” says Pereira. “Already ready for the Premier League? It’s up to Chelsea to say but, one day, he will be voted the best player in the world. He’s a spectacular kid and he’s going to shine in Europe.”\nAdvertisement\nEstevao had an outstanding season for Palmeiras in 2024, scoring 13 times and providing nine assists in 31 league matches as Palmeiras finished second behind Botafogo in the Brasileiro.\nThe Club World Cup will be the first chance for many Chelsea fans to watch him properly, with Palmeiras drawn in a group with Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami, Porto and Egyptian side Al Ahly.\nPalmeiras have not been told how much they stand to earn from the tournament depending on how far they go and do not know where they will be staying in the U.S, although they will choose their camp soon based on the options proposed by FIFA.\nPereira admits the tickets for fans will have “high prices” but says, “People have to know that it is a big show and big shows have high prices. It’s a tournament of world championship magnitude.”\nThe president has no doubt many of Palmeiras’ 20million-strong fanbase will do “the possible and the impossible” to travel in support. She says the club will offer them help with flights and accommodation.\nChelsea’s multi-club parent company BlueCo has shown an interest in buying a South American club, with a particular focus on Brazil. Did that possibility arise in negotiations for Estevao?\n“Palmeiras is not a company, so there is no way to do it,” says Pereira. “It’s not the same as Botafogo, for example (who are owned by the American Crystal Palace minority stakeholder John Textor). Palmeiras doesn’t have an owner, so it’s difficult for us to participate in a group. Chelsea never talked to us about this, mainly because it’s impossible.”\nIn terms of young talents to recently leave Palmeiras, the most high-profile is Endrick.\nIn December 2022, when he was 16, Real Madrid beat Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona and Chelsea to his signing for €35million plus €25m in variables. Madrid have paid almost €48million of the possible €60m for Endrick after he achieved all the possible bonuses while he was still in Brazil. In the Spanish capital, there will be bonuses for his number of goals, matches and titles.\nAdvertisement\nThe striker only moved to the Bernabeu last summer when he had turned 18, following FIFA regulations — but since then, he has played just 315 minutes in 19 games across all competitions, scoring four goals.\n“We foresaw that,” says Pereira. “He’s very young, a young talent, but it’s difficult for a kid to come out of Brazil and adapt immediately. He will have patience because he is very determined, focused. He will shine a lot in Real Madrid.”\nHave Palmeiras tried to bring him back to Brazilian football?\n“No, it was never discussed,” says Pereira. “There are no possibilities. For this kind of thing to happen, it has to be good for Palmeiras, for the player and for Real Madrid.\n“This return was never discussed because this period of adaptation to the new club and to Europe was foreseeable. He is going to be very, very happy at Real Madrid, I have no doubts.”\nPereira was head of Brazil’s delegation when they played England at Wembley and Spain at the Bernabeu in March 2024, with Endrick scoring in both games. It was the first time a woman had taken the role, which changes each international break and is occupied by someone from a Brazilian club.\nAt the Bernabeu, she met Madrid president Florentino Perez and Endrick. What did Perez say to her?\n“That it was a pleasure to be with me,” says Pereira. “He also told me, ‘Leila, I have been informed that Endrick is better than Pele’. and I told him, ‘Calm down, president, as nobody else like Pele has ever been born’.”\n(Top photo: Ricardo Moreira/Getty Images)",
