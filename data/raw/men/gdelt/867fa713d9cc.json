We need that difference-maker.”\nFadlu expressed appreciation for club’s President Mohammed Dewji, acknowledging his continued support throughout the transfer window.\nHe also called on Simba’s new financiers, Jayrutty Investment, to help secure the final signing before the window closes.\n“Our hope now, in these final stages of the window, is that Jayrutty Investment can step in and help us land this big signing. It’s the player who can make a difference in the finals. With Champions League football ahead, this could be the defining step,” he said.\nLooking ahead to the new season, Fadlu made it clear that one of Simba’s top priorities is to reclaim domestic dominance from rivals Yanga.\n“We know how strong Yanga are in big games. To overtake them this season, we need that final piece of the puzzle before the transfer window shuts,” he stated.\nSimba fell just short in key moments last season, and Fadlu believes the right creative signing could help the team cross that threshold, especially in CAF Champions League competition.\nReflecting on the win over Wadi Degla, Fadlu highlighted several positives from the performance but admitted the team must become more clinical in front of goal.\nALSO READ: Simba SC Board Chairman steps down\n“Of course, we could have scored more goals, that’s maybe what we’re still missing,” he noted.\n“There’s still work to be done in terms of understanding positioning, attacking patterns and defensive shape, but this camp has been a big step forward.”\nFadlu is thanking Dewji, along with Malz and the recruitment team, for their work behind the scenes to strengthen the squad.\n“We’ve had tremendous backing from the president. His support has been vital in the recruitment process and with the help of the scouting team, we’ve made great strides,” he said.\nMeanwhile, Simba’s Media and Communication Manager, Ahmed Ally, confirmed that the squad will return tomorrow from Egypt, where they have been holding pre-season training camp.\nAlly further revealed that the official launch of Simba’s new kits is scheduled for Saturday in Dar es Salaam, while the much-anticipated Simba Week celebrations will take place on Sunday in Mafinga, Iringa region.",
