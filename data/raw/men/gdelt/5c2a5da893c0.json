Basildon-born Alexei has represented Colombia at international youth level, as well as Russia and England.\nHe began playing football at Boreham Wood as well as St Albans City and London Colney Colts before joining our academy in 2019.

He is a young goalkeeper with big potential and we look forward to supporting his development in the coming years.”\n“I already know Ethan [Nwnaeri] and Myles [Lewis-Skelly],” Tommy said. “They’re great guys and I can have a good laugh with them. I spent a few camps with them, so I know them well. I just saw them for a quick meet and greet!”\nJosh Nichols\nBorn: 26/07/2006\nJoined: 30/03/2016\nA flying full back who can operate on the right or the left, Josh made 35 appearances across our academy sides last season, including all six group games in the UEFA Youth League. One of his three goals of the season came in Europe, away to PSV Eindhoven.\nHe joined our academy at under-9s level, grew up playing more as a striker or a winger, before finding his feet at full back. He signed pro forms with us at the start of the season.\nAyden Heaven\nBorn: 22/09/2006\nJoined: 05/11/2019\nVersatility is one of Ayden’s key strengths, as he is capable of playing in central defence or as a box-to-box midfielder, adept at progressing the play and imposing himself on matches. Last season Ayden (formerly known as Ayden John) made 11 appearances for our under-18s side as well as 17 for the under-21s.\nThe left-footed defender also played five times in the UEFA Youth League, and was named on the bench for the first team in our Champions League Round of 16 match away to Porto. Highly-rated Ayden is an England youth international.\nOmar Rekik\nBorn: 20/12/2001\nJoined: 02/01/2021\nPowerful ball-playing central defender Omar played most of his football last season on loan at Wigan Athletic in League One – his second consecutive season with the Latics. He has also played on loan for Sparta Rotterdam in the Eredivisie since his last set of games for our under-21s team in Premier League 2 in the 2021/22 season.\nBefore joining us in 2021, he featured regularly for Hertha Berlin’s youth teams and was also on the books at Feyenoord, Manchester City, PSV and Marseille.

Playing mainly at right back, he scored nine goals in the process, often from set-pieces, and provided six assists.\nHis best spell came between September and January, when Michal registered a goal or assist in seven out of eight games. Also comfortable in midfield, he has represented Poland at international youth level since first being called up for their under-15s team.\nCharles Sagoe Jr\nBorn: 24/07/2004\nJoined: 16/07/2015\nA composed and intelligent forward who is dangerous on either wing, Charles Jr made his debut for the first team last season when he started our Carabao Cup win away to Brentford. He then completed a loan move to Swansea City, playing twice in the Championship.\nCharles Jr’s best goalscoring season was 2021/22, when he netted nine times in 26 U18 Premier League games and he scored three more for our youth teams last season in all competitions. An Arsenal player from the age of nine, he is eligible to represent England and Ghana at international level.\nMyles Lewis-Skelly\nBorn: 26/09/2006\nJoined: 16/05/2015\nDynamic, ball-carrying midfielder Myles joined our Hale End Academy at under-9s level, and enjoyed an excellent first season as a full-time scholar, signing his first pro contract upon turning 17.

He has also represented the Netherlands at international youth level.\nSalah got off to a flying start in pre-season, scoring two goals and providing one assist away to Boreham Wood while playing with his brother Ismail for the first time.\nJimi Gower\nBorn: 01/10/2004\nJoined: 28/06/2017\nOften seen dictating the play, central midfielder Jimi made a real impression in our under-21s team last season after stepping up from the under-18s. He made 20 appearances in Premier League 2, scoring two goals and assisting twice.\nHe was one of the key players in our 6-2 win over Manchester United in the play-off round of 16. Jimi signed his first professional contract in July 2023 after joining us from Southend United’s youth setup in 2017 at the age of 13.\nEthan Nwaneri\nBorn: 21/03/2007\nJoined: 16/05/2015\nThe youngest player ever to represent our men’s first team when he came on against Brentford in September 2022 aged 15 (also becoming the youngest player in Premier League history in the process), attacking midfielder Ethan gained more first-team experience last term. He came on during our 6-0 win at West Ham in February, having been regularly involved on the bench for Mikel Arteta’s side.\nAt youth level the talented playmaker once again excelled, scoring 18 times from 20 appearances, including five against Crewe Alexandra in the 7-1 FA Youth Cup win in December. A highly technical, creative player who can operate in the No. 10 role or out wide, Ethan was our top scorer in Premier League 2 with 11 goals from 15 games.\nHe made his debut for the under-21s while still a schoolboy and signed his first pro contract with us upon turning 17 in March 2024. He scored 15 goals in 28 appearances for England Under-17s – including three at the 2024 U-17 European Championships in May.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
