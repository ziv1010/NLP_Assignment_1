Transfer Talk brings you all the latest buzz on rumours, comings, goings and, of course, done deals!\nTOP STORY: Newcastle United think they can woo Raphinha from Barcelona\nNewcastle United are keen to make a move for Barcelona winger Raphinha in the summer, according to a report by Mundo Deportivo.\nThe Magpies were interested in a transfer for the Brazil international before the current campaign, but he eventually moved from Leeds United to Camp Nou, with his desire to represent the Blaugrana playing a key part in the deal.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\n- Read on ESPN+: Why Bellingham is worth the hype\nWith Newcastle poised for Champions League football next season, the club are expected to make another play for the 26-year-old given Barcelona's financial struggles, which could mean they would be willing to part ways with Raphinha. The report goes as far as to suggest Barcelona must reduce their salary budget by €200m and bring in €100m in transfer fees to reach financial security.\nBarcelona manager Xavi Hernandez has called upon Raphinha throughout this season, with the winger recording nine goals and nine assists in 41 appearances across all competitions this term -- but the player's visible frustrations when being substituted are going against him. In addition, Raphinha is said to want to play on the right wing, where Xavi prefers to deploy Ousmane Dembele.\nDue to those factors, while Raphinha isn't a priority departure for the Blaugrana, the LaLiga giants are expected to be open to it, especially as there is plenty of interest from the Premier League, especially due to Raphinha's experience in England and status as a Brazil international.\nNewcastle also want 18-year-old Athletico Paranaense striker Vitor Roque, who Barcelona are keeping an eye on for the future.\nLIVE BLOG\n21.30 BST: Chelsea players want Mauricio Pochettino to be their next manager, according the Telegraph.\nAfter the exit of Graham Potter, who was fired earlier this month, Pochettino has been in talks to take over the job, and players are backing him.

Former Bayern Munich boss Nagelsmann then pulled out of the running after becoming frustrated with the lengthy recruitment process.\nFormer Australia head coach Postecoglu won the Scottish league title in his first season in charge of Celtic last term, and the club are 12 points clear of bitter rivals Rangers at the top of the SPFL in 2022-23.\nThe 57-year-old has also won two Scottish League Cups for Celtic with his attacking brand of football, and also has experience of managing in the Champions League with the Glasgow club this season.\n12.17 BST: Newcastle United want Arsenal's Kieran Tierney to boost their options at left-back next season, according to The Sun.\nDan Burn has filled in there for the Magpies this season in a departure from his more familiar centre-defensive role, even keeping his place there ahead of recognised full-back Matt Targett.\nHowever, Newcastle boss Eddie Howe wants a left-back who offers more of an attacking threat, and Tierney fits the bill. The 25-year-old Scotland international has been a key player for Arsenal, but a long-term struggle with injuries and the summer signing of Oleksandr Zinchenko have seen his career at the Emirates stall.\nHowe has backed Burn after the defender has faced criticism in recent week. He said ahead of Sunday's clash with Tottenham: \"I'm surprised if Dan's getting criticised because that's a severe underestimation of what he brings to the team.\n\"He has been incredible. We didn't plan the season with him at left-back -- it happened through injuries and he got an opportunity. He's a slightly unusual presence there but his attitude and application have been the highest level.\n\"Sometimes you can't measure what he gives. We value Dan very highly in whatever position he plays and his versatility is important as well.\"\n11.31 BST: Barcelona plan to make not one but two signings from Chelsea this summer in N'Golo Kante and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the Daily Mirror reports.\nFrance midfielder Kante is out of contract in the summer, and Barca are hopeful that the 32-year-old will agree to a two-year deal at Camp Nou on a lower wage then he gets at Stamford Bridge.\nAubameyang only left Barca to join Chelsea last summer as the club desperately sought to reduce their wage bill. The striker scored 13 goals in 24 appearances over the second half of last term after his midseason move from arsenal, but at Chelsea he has scored just once in 13 Premier League appearances.\nChelsea will be looking to shed plenty of players from their over-stocked squad this summer, and could jump at the chance to offload two players in one go.\n- Barcelona vs. Atletico: Stream LIVE Sunday, 10.15 a.m. ET, ESPN+ (U.S.)\n10.43 BST: Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins has agreed a new contract at the club, according to Teamtalk.\nWatkins, 27, is one of the most in-form strikers across Europe's top leagues.

That's the only thing I care about.\"\n09.00 BST: How special is Gabriel Veiga? Just ask anyone who's spent any time watching LaLiga this season. The Celta Vigo midfielder, 20, has been Spanish football's breakout young star, his performances leading to the avalanche of hype and headlines that only the emergence of a top new talent can trigger.\nFrom his first goal against Atletico Madrid in September, to his first brace against Real Betis in February, the milestones have kept coming.

Not bad for a central midfielder.\nWord soon spread, with Celta president Carlos Mourino saying in March that \"four of the Premier League's top 10\" had called to ask about Veiga's release clause.
