  "body_text": "The 7 best players of Premier League Gameweek 37 - ranked\n- Haaland and Saliba shone at the top of the table\n- Villa's super-sub secured Champions League football\n- The best players of gameweek 37 of the 2023/24 Premier League season\n37 gameweeks down, and just more to go in the 2023/24 Premier League season.\nGameweek 37 was yet another in which plenty of players stepped to put in match-winning contributions and score season-defining goals.\nAnd after all of that fun, here's 90min's pick for the seven best players of this past week of brilliant Premier League football.\n7. Bernardo Silva\nSpoiler: Bernardo Silva is one of the many Manchester City players on this list.\nThe dynamic wide midfielder was irrepressible in the much-needed weekend win over Fulham, setting up two his side's four goals on a sunny day at Craven Cottage.\nHis cross to set up Josko Gvardiol's second is well worth a watch if you haven't seen already, it was inch perfect.\n6. Michael Olise\nIt's no surprise that Crystal Palace have looked like a much, much better football team since Michael Olise returned to action.\nThe Manchester United target inspired Palace to a fifth win in their last six Premier League games over the weekend, netting a stunning curling opener before his side's third to seal all three points against Wolves.\n5. Bryan Mbeumo\nIn a season during which Brentford's star man Ivan Toney has either been suspended or out of form, Bryan Mbeumo has usually been the guy to step up in the final third.\nHe did it again in the 2-1 win over Bournemouth on Saturday, bagging his 14th and 15th Premier League goal contributions of the season at the Vitality.\n4. William Saliba\nIt's basically official at this point: William Saliba is the best centre-back in the world.\nThe defender was once again at his brilliant best against Manchester United on Sunday, winning 100% of his duels, making six clearances and completing 90% of his passes.\nHe's the reason why Arsenal have the best defensive record in the Premier League this season.\n3. Josko Gvardiol\nThree goals in his last four games - that's good for a striker never mind a left-back.\nJosko Gvardiol has been oddly effective in the final third of late, continuing his fine form with a brace in the 4-0 win over Fulham. His first goal was particularly remarkable given his natural position on the pitch.\n2. Erling Haaland\nCometh the hour, cometh the man.\nManchester City needed to beat Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday night, and they did exactly that thanks to their mercurial number nine.\nErling Haaland's brace took his tally for the season to 27 to all-but secure the Golden Boot, and also earned three points which may have all-but secured a fourth-consecutive Premier League title for Man City. A good day at the office.\n1. Jhon Duran\nAston Villa's super-sub made the most super of contributions on Monday evening.\nComing off the bench in the 79th minute, Jhon Duran would go on to net two late goals to complete a dramatic comeback for his side and secure a 3-3 draw.\nAnd thanks to Tottenham's defeat to Man City, that draw was enough to secure Villa a place in the UEFA Champions League next season.\nDuran, you're now officially an Aston Villa legend.",
