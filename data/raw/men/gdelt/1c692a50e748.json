  "body_text": "Women's Champions League matchday 4 predictions\n- Matchday four in the UWCL group stage gets underway on Wednesday\n- Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea are all in action\n- 90min has predicted the results of this week’s fixtures\nThe group stage of the 2024/25 UEFA Women’s Champions League continues this week with matchday four.\nMatchday three brought all of the action, with all three competing English sides claiming three points in their respective fixtures. Arsenal claimed an emphatic 4-0 victory over Juventus in Italy, before Man City got the job done over Hammarby with a 2-0 win at the Joie Stadium.\nA heavily rotated Chelsea side managed to claim a victory over Celtic in Glasgow, with goals from Maika Hamano and Ashleigh Lawrence solidifying a 2-1 win on the road.\nThe sixteen teams will return this week, for another exciting round of fixtures on the European stage.\n90min takes a look at all of the matchday four matches and predicts who may come out victorious.\nWomen's Champions League - matchday 4 fixtures\n- Arsenal vs Juventus\n- St. Polten vs Barcelona\n- Hammarby vs Man City\n- Valerenga vs Bayern Munich\n- Wolfsburg vs Galatasaray\n- FC Twente vs Real Madrid\n- Lyon vs Roma\n- Chelsea vs Celtic\nWomen's Champions League - matchday 4 predictions\nWolfsburg vs Galatasaray\nWolfsburg were back to their best last week, running home with a 5-0 victory over Galatasaray in Turkey.\nA hat-trick from Sweden's Rebecka Blomqvist helped boost the dominant performance from the German side, and Galatasaray simply failed to keep up.\nIf the first leg is anything to go by, Wolfsburg will be expected to run away with victory this Wednesday evening as they return home to the AOK Stadion.\nPrediction: Wolfsburg 0-3 Wolfsburg\nFC Twente vs Real Madrid\nAnother Champions League thrashing came from Real Madrid last week, as Las Blancas dominated FC Twente on home turf. Six seperate goalscorers from Madrid saw FC Twente bow-out in a 7-0 defeat at Estadio Alfredo Di Stefano.\nDespite showing bright signs in the early stages of their Champions League campaign, FC Twente are now threatened with the possibility of being six points adrift of Real Madrid if they are to lose on Wednesday evening. We can expect that the Dutch side will try to make a brave account for themselves as they return home to De Grolsch Veste.\nThe 7-0 scoreline in the reverse fixture paints a nightmarish picture for FC Twente heading into the home leg, however the side will be eager to show up in better form this time around.\nPrediction: FC Twente 1-3 Real Madrid\nChelsea vs Celtic\nChelsea will search to extend their unbeaten European run this season as they host Celtic FC at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night.\nDespite putting out a heavily rotated squad, Sonia Bompastor's Blues were able to get the job done last week in Glasgow. Chelsea will be keen to be more clinical than they were last week, after registering 26 shots in the 2-1 win.\nCeltic will be eager to draw on the opening goal that saw them take the lead over Chelsea in the fixture's early stages, but will have to remain incredibly disciplined in order to nullify the home sides attacking threat.\nPrediction: Chelsea 4-0 Celtic FC\nLyon vs Roma\nAnother Champions League giant ran away with victory on matchday three, with Lyon registering a 3-0 victory over a talented Roma side on the road. Lyon sit comfortably at the summit of their group standings heading into the home fixture at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais.\nIt will be extremely difficult for any side to stop this Lyon juggernaut in Europe, especially on home turf. The French side are as clinical as ever, registering eight goals across three group stage fixtures.\nRoma should still make a good account for themselves, definitely having the squad talent to take it to the former UWCL Champions.\nPrediction: Lyon 3-1 Roma\nValerenga vs Bayern Munich\nThere doesn't seem to be any stopping Bayern Munich at the moment, with the German giants remaining undefeated in Europe so far. Bayern have won all three of their group stage fixtures, scoring 10 goals across the games.\nLast week was no different, they clinched a 3-0 victory over a winless Valerenga. Pernille Harder was back on the scoresheet again, having scored half of Bayern's total European goals thus far.\nIt is almost certain that Thursday evening will follow a similar narrative, with Bayern the likely victors at Oslo's Intility Arena.\nPrediction: Valerenga 0-4 Bayern Munich\nHammarby vs Man City\nThe incredible Bajen support wasn't enough to get Hammarby over the line at the Joie Stadium, as goals from Laura Blindkilde Brown and Aoba Fujino solidifed a 2-0 victory for Man City.\nThe home win keeps City at the summit of their group, sitting three points above back-to-back champions Barcelona. An away trip to face Hammarby will provide Gareth Taylor's side with a great opportunity to maintain that distance between themselves and the defending champions.\nHammarby will certainly aim to make a brave account of themselves on Thursday evening and could cause some surprises, but City will likely get the job done in Stockholm.\nPrediction: Hammarby 0-3 Man City\nSt. Polten vs Barcelona\nThe defending Champions were back to their very best last Tuesday, triumphing 7-0 over St. Polten at the Estadi Johan Cruyff. Barcelona have bounced-back from their 2-0 defeat against Man City on matchday one of the Champions League, scoring 16 goals in the last two group stage games.\nIf last week's result is anything to go by, Barcelona should be comfortable winners on Thursday night as they travel to Vienna to face St. Polten in the away leg.\nPrediction: St. Polten 0-4 Barcelona\nArsenal vs Juventus\nThe Gunners were comfortable victors last week in Biella, running out the away leg with a 4-0 victory over Juventus. Arsenal now return to N5 to host the Italian side at the Emirates Stadium, and will be eager to extend their Champions League winning streak.\nDespite putting on a lacklustre display at home last week, Arsenal will not underestimate the threat that Juventus can still pose on Thursday night. Max Canzi's side will need to come out firing in order to make up the difference that currently sees them sitting third in their side - three points behind Arsenal.",
