  "body_text": "Feyenoord manager Arne Slot confirms he will move to Liverpool\nFootball manager Arne Slot has admitted for the first time that he will be leaving for Liverpool. “There has not been an official announcement yet, but I can confirm that I will become the coach there next season. But that is no surprise to you,” he said at a press conference on Friday ahead of Sunday’s final league match against Excelsior.\nSlot, 45, will take over for Jürgen Klopp at Liverpool, after the German manager decided to take a break after nine years. Slot quickly signed a multi-year contract with the current number three of the Premier League. His upcoming departure to Liverpool has been rumored for some time, but the trainer himself did not want to talk about the English top club in recent weeks.\nSlot wants to take his assistant, Sipke Hulshoff, to Anfield. Dutch football association KNVB announced last week that Hulshoff will leave the Dutch men’s national team before the European Championships in Germany. Dwight Lodeweges will replace him during the European finals in Germany.\nSlot succeeded Dick Advocaat as head coach at Feyenoord three years ago. He guided the Rotterdam club to the Conference League final during his first season, in which they lost to AS Roma. Under Slot’s leadership, Feyenoord became Eredivisie champions last year, and the club won the Dutch Cup last month and a second place finish on the league table.\nThe effective manager made Feyenoord play an attacking and notable football style, and often made a strong impression in the media. He also performed in Europe with his current squad. With Slot on the bench, Feyenoord rose from the preliminary rounds of the Conference League to the group stage of the Champions League.\nSlot rejected an offer from Tottenham Hotspur last year and committed his future to Feyenoord with a new contract until mid-2026. But the former SC Cambuur and AZ coach does not want to miss the opportunity to succeed Klopp at Liverpool. Dutch players Virgil van Dijk, Cody Gakpo and Ryan Gravenberch are all under contract with Liverpool.\nSlot has taken the time in recent days to say goodbye to Feyenoord’s staff. He gave and received gifts. “The feeling that I’m leaving here is getting stronger. Some people you don’t just want to shake hands with. At those times, it’s not about whether you have become a champion or won the cup, but more about the appreciation between people,” he said.\n“To notice that people are genuinely sorry that you are leaving, you can say that with words, but when you see it in people’s facial expressions, it means a lot to me.”\nReporting by ANP",
