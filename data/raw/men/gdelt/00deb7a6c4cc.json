However, after suffering an injury in just his second game for United, he has endured extended spells on the sidelines across his two seasons at Old Trafford.\nLast term, he was limited to just 17 Premier League appearances. He started a mere seven games.\nYet, despite his lengthy absences, Mount has been identified as a key member of the squad by both former manager Erik ten Hag and current head coach Ruben Amorim.\nAmorim has repeatedly spoken glowingly of Mount’s application and diligence in training, praising him as an ideal player for his 3-4-2-1 system.\nMount scored a fantastic goal for United in their 2-2 pre-season draw with Everton in Atlanta. The former Chelsea man has demonstrated positive signs during the tour and is facing a big year with the Red Devils.\nFerdinand has claimed that Mount can have the impact of a new signing if he manages to stay fit and available to Amorim for selection.\nFerdinand comments on Mount\nSpeaking on talkSPORT [as quoted by TBR Football], Ferdinand explained, “I saw him out in Chicago and that’s one of the things I said to him – like, how are you feeling? Because he’d been robbed of any minutes really, through injury, and it’s been really, really disappointing to see.”\n“Take you back to when you played – being injured and in the shadows. I never had that at a new club, but when I was at a club – that is so depressing.”\n“It can take your soul away at times, and I’m sure he’s been in some dark moments.”\nFerdinand continued, “But yeah, he will be like a new signing, I think. Listen, he’s no surprise. Whenever he’s been fit in his career, he’s played – Chelsea especially – and the managers have played him.”\n“When they won the Champions League, one of the most important players.”\n“He has the quality, he has the work ethic, he has the legs, he has the ability to be a really, really good top player.”\nFeatured image AJ Reynolds via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
