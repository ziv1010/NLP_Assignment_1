That’s it.\n“I know what a big club Bayern Munich is. I’m very proud but also very motivated to start. The season could start today, right away.”\nKompany asserted his appointment should not be regarded as a surprise and revealed he had attracted interest from other clubs.\nHe said: “I think the aspect of being surprised is because you assume that it was the only club that called, and you assume that it was the only interest I had.\n“You only assume that because I’m very private, that’s the only reason. I was actually quite fortunate to have a lot of interest from other clubs as well.”\nKompany will be under immediate pressure to regain the Bundesliga title, which the club missed out on this year for the first time since 2012, and challenge in the Champions League.\nIt is an obvious step up in intensity from what he faced at Turf Moor but the Belgian maintains that will not bother him.\nHe said: “The question about pressure, you’re going to ask me maybe another 10,000 times before the start of the season, but it’s going to be the same answer.\n“I have a different way of dealing with it. It’s not part of my life.”\nKompany also dismissed worries about how he will work with elite players. He feels that, after skippering City to four Premier League triumphs, he belongs at such a level.\nHe said: “I’ve lived at this level for most of my career. I’ve been in these dressing rooms for most of my career.\n“But in the main, you always adapt to the people and the cultures and the individuals that you have in the dressing room. I’ve learned this at every level of football.”\nKompany feels he proved to himself during the highs and lows that he experienced at Burnley that he is level-headed enough for the job.\nHe said: “You learn a lot about yourself. The first year, you have 46 games and we only lost three, 101 points – the highest of the highest the club has ever achieved in terms of points return.\n“Then the next year, you have a tough season in the Premier League.\n“What you learn about yourself in the very highs and the very lows is that you can be consistent.\n“I didn’t approach players differently. I didn’t work less to prepare games.\n“I have no intention to all of a sudden become a different person, and I don’t think that’s what they want.”",
