  "body_text": "The news of Dan Friedkin probably buying Everton seems to have generally gone down well.\nDuring the course of a boring Italy v Albania match, I thought I’d have a look at how he has run Roma, as an indication of what might be in store for us. For those hoping to see a spending spree, the retention of Branthwaite, and the replacement of Dyche with a sexier manager, then be warned – this article isn’t for you…\nBackground\nFriedkin bought Roma in August 2020 for around £465M. A few facts about Roma at that point:\n- Roma had just finished 5th in Serie A, 8 points behind 4th-place Lazio – and so just missing out on a Champions League spot;\n- They were rated (by Transfermarkt) as having the 4th most valuable squad in Serie A – €380M.\nWhat has been the trend since?\nWorking backwards from the 2023-24 season to the 2020-21 season, it looks like this:\n- League placings: 6th, 6th, 6th, 7th;\n- Squad value: €320M (6th), €341M (6th), €411M (5th), €398M (6th)\nSo, on a very crude metric, Roma have been more or less matching the value of their squad in terms of performance. That’s fairly normal. And it’s a continuation of where they were pre-takeover – albeit falling further away from Champions League placings.\nThe managers\n- Daniele DeRossi: 2023-24;\n- Jose Mourinho: 2021-22 to 2023-24;\n- Paulo Fonseca: 2019-20 to 2020-21.\nI’ll give you a quote from ESPN on why Mourinho was sacked because it is pretty illuminating for us, I reckon:\nHere's the reality – Mourinho wasn't sacked because he had lost the dressing room or because fans were calling for his head: …. Rather, he's gone because the Friedkins are businessmen, and they made a business decision.\n… Roma lost €184M ($200M) in 2020-21 and €219M ($238.1M) the following year, Mourinho's first at the club. The record losses in 2021-22, when they were among the biggest net spenders on transfers in Europe, meant they breached UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations and were put under a settlement agreement, which restricted their spending.\nEffectively, the club had gambled that investing heavily on the squad (initially on transfer fees, later in pricey veteran free agents, giving the club the third highest wage bill in the league) and on Mourinho himself (the second-highest-paid manager in Serie A) would deliver consistent Champions League football. That, in turn, would drive revenue, both in terms of prize money and commercial deals. Instead, they finished sixth in his first two seasons while winning the UEFA Europa Conference League in 2021-22 and reaching the Europa League final the following year.\nTo put it bluntly, the managerial position is very much driven by delivery against financial metrics rather than sporting success. A Europa Conference League trophy doesn’t really pass muster if you’re spending at Champions League level (exactly how Everton were behaving 2016 to 2020, albeit without any silverware).\nThe spending\nAlthough the club has stayed very stable as one of the best of the rest in the Europa League places, it has been achieved against the backdrop of very different spending in the past couple of years:\n2023-24: 18th lowest spenders at +€63M (6th) and finished 6th\n2022-23: +€64M (6th) and finished 6th\n2021-22: –€115M (5th) and finished 6th\n2020-21: +€26M (6th) and finished 7th\n2019-20: +€10M (6th) and finished 5th (in the season before Friedkin bought)\nSo the trend of the past two seasons is extremely heavy cost-cutting and players sales. Only a very small fraction of the proceeds of sales have been reinvested in the playing squad. However, it doesn’t seem to have hurt them. They’ve managed to maintain (albeit not improve) the value of the squad (relative to peers) and the league placings despite the extremely heavy cost cutting.\nWages\nThis information is harder to find (for me at least).\nIt looks as though Roma currently have the third biggest wage bill in Serie A at €111M. That is a deeply concerning position for the club – when you compare it to, say, Bologna who finished just above them in 5th this season and have a wage bill of only €28M.\nI can’t tell what the trend is with this over the period of Friedkin’s ownership, because I can’t find the data. However, it looks as though high wages are a legacy of heavy spending in the early Mourinho years – that ties in with the ESPN article. They were probably hoping that his management combined with a bit of a spending gamble could get them competing at the top of the table. They were wrong. With their 5th to 7th finishes, they are underperforming their wage bill by some distance. In Serie A, 5th to 7th in wages terms is between €60M to €75M.\nThis creates an unsustainable position for the club and drives behaviour in the transfer market.\nTransfers\nThis is probably the depressing bit for those hoping to see a spending spree to reinvigorate the Everton squad. In the past two seasons, Roma have only bought three players for a fee:\n- Baldanzi – €10M from Empoli\n- Celik – €7M from Lille\n- Paredes – €2.5M from PSG\nOtherwise, the squad has been bolstered by a very high volume of loans and free transfers. In fact, that’s very clearly the focus of their transfer activity.\nThey brought in 8 players on loan in the past 2 seasons and 7 free transfers. The free transfers have largely been good quality, including; Dybala, Ndicka, Aouar, Svilar, Belotti and Matic. The loans too, with the likes of Lukaku, Angelino, Kristiansen, Llorente, Azmoun, Sanches, Huijsen and Camara.\nEspecially with the frees of Ndicka, Aouar and Svilar, this looks like a fairly low-cost way of managing the squad and transfers. I do wonder though if the volume of free transfers hits the wage bill a bit, since players on a free can probably demand slightly higher wages than they might otherwise have got. The loans of Lukaku and Sanches will have cost big wages too.\nThe Squad\nInterestingly, the First XI is not built on the players bought in the heavier spending days of a few seasons ago. A set of players bought for over €20M has either moved on already or failed to deliver. This is a consistent picture for transfers generally – except for those clubs who can afford to pay top dollar for genuine talent.\nRoma (like Everton) have discovered that, for the less well-resourced clubs, there’s generally no point spending more than about €20M on a player – because there are almost always a good range of lower-cost options available for the same sort of quality.\nInstead, they are very obviously building up a squad patiently on the cheap.\nWhat does it mean for Everton?\nObviously, time will tell… but it seems to me that, this summer, any Friedkin-led ownership will simply carry on with what has always looked likely – sales of Branthwaite and Onana and reinvestment of no more than about 50% of the sales proceeds back into the squad.\nTransfer activity will again revolve around a few lower-cost purchases and probably very heavy use of the free and loan market.\nAs I have maintained for a little while now, that is disappointing but need not be doom and gloom. The early Moshiri years showed us how pointless it is to spend big money on average players – when there are plenty of average players to be found at very low cost indeed. What is worthwhile is spending a bit more on genuine youth talent – like Roma have done with Baldanzi, a player who is not yet established in the First XI but could well be a really important player for them over the next 5 to 10 years.\nIn terms of management, I think Friedkin (and basically every interested party) will see Sean Dyche as an absolute diamond – a rare manager with a track record of outperforming the quality of the squad and level of investment. The idea of sacking him and replacing him with an inevitably higher-risk 'name' seems extremely unlikely.\nSo expect the likes of Adams, Brownhill, Bogle, McBurnie and Taylor – all likely targets on free transfers – and the likes of Phillips, Luiz, Broja, Ugochukwu, Fofana, Brereton Diaz, Ndiaye, Hutchison, Barranachea, McAtee, Norton-Cuffey, Nelson, Kabore and Doyle – all likely targets on loan.\nAnd maybe no more than just two or three actual purchases. We’ll see.\nReader Comments (71)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission. Comments are the responsibility of the poster. Disclaimer ()\n1 Posted 16/06/2024 at 08:37:58\nOur use of those markets over the past two years has been poor with at least one loan player never (or hardly ever) playing and others being bit part players. Only Harrison has been a regular starter with loan players over the past 2 years.\nSo, as seems likely with your analysis of Friedkin's methods, we really need to find four really good loans for key positions, especially if we sell Onana and Branthwaite. I hope Thelwell has better judgement this year than he has in the past; otherwise, we could be in for another difficult season.\n2 Posted 16/06/2024 at 09:10:47\nBut without the negative or absent directorship...\nSo definitely a move in the right direction, bring it on\n3 Posted 16/06/2024 at 10:02:46\n4 Posted 16/06/2024 at 10:17:37\nour recent history to recognise the absence of any of the above can be disastrous.\nThere's so much to tell about the chaos of the last 12 months (if not longer) a period of stability, of financial management and decent comminications will be a welcome advance. They also know that whilst they will enjoy a honeymoon of sorts, progress on the pitch is what fans (rightly) want to see\n5 Posted 16/06/2024 at 10:24:18\n6 Posted 16/06/2024 at 11:04:01\nLeaving the football side to the Manager (hopefully, Dyche) and Thelwell, to carry out a search for best we can get, in loans and perhaps steady players that don't cost much.\nYou've shown how many good value players are knocking about and, hopefully, we'll look at bringing in youngsters with talent.\nEven without the threat of the Premier League coming for us again, it's likely to be a hard season.\nAs for the last lot in charge? Professionalism, Integrity, Business Acumen! I don't think they knew what those words meant.\nIf we're lucky, we won't get any more points deducted, but whether or not, our season and our future depends on us staying up, but equally, if not more importantly, is getting the good ship Everton on an even keel and staying afloat.\nIf his bid is successful, and it looks like he's the one, he's certainly proved he's a good businessman, wants success and knows how to achieve it.\n7 Posted 16/06/2024 at 11:08:35\n8 Posted 16/06/2024 at 12:04:05\nI've been watching a few old videos this morning, videos that always get my Everton Emotions started, and it's quite clear that the only time Evertonians have really been truly united over the last couple of decades, is when we have helped pull the club clear of relegation.\nGive Everton Football Club, true professionalism, genuine integrity and clever business people and I'm absolutely certain that the fans will do the rest.\nI'm not talking being champions overnight, but even the Mickey Mouse Cup, would feel like heaven for the thousands of absolutely fantastic and fanatical Evertonians, who have truly stood the test of time - Potless.\n9 Posted 16/06/2024 at 12:53:00\nI just want this sorting out one way or another and eagerly await the fixtures being released next week.\nTony. The League Cup. Just give us it. Partly to bury my demon, but also to give my son and nephew, as well as countless young Evertonians something.\nGive us Europe. Forget the Scottish, thousands of Evertonians would travel ticket or not.\nThen we go and rebuild this great club of ours. I will never stop, I just want those young supporters to have something other listening to the likes of me.\n10 Posted 16/06/2024 at 13:05:36\n11 Posted 16/06/2024 at 13:22:51\n12 Posted 16/06/2024 at 13:23:37\nI stood on the Stretford end in 1977 for the league cup final second replay convinced it was going to be our year, now 47 years on it still frustrates the life out of me how this club has not achieved at least one Mickey Mouse cup. Whenever the subject is raised I always go on the defence and tell them we would have won it in 70/71 with our 1st Division winning side but didn't bother entering, the rules were changed the following season that made entry compulsory.\n13 Posted 16/06/2024 at 13:57:06\nA couple of good unexpected results and possible struggles with manager/player turnover in the top six and we may be in a speculative position by January. Then is when Friedkin tells Thelwell to go get the new improved Super Kev; the one that gets us in European competition again.\n14 Posted 16/06/2024 at 13:59:46\nThat and European Qualification â€“ even if just the Europa Conference League.\n15 Posted 16/06/2024 at 14:00:10\n' I will try to explain who the two sharks are, father, who have been killing Roma for four years. Dan and Ryan Friedkin are two sleazy speculators who took Roma for two cents.\nThey exploited the debt that the old management had, since without debt they would have had to pay it out of their own pockets.\nThey only paid out of their own pocket the part given to James Pallott, i.e. 190 million euros that the old owner had put in from his pocket.\nThis cost Roma to the Friedkins.\nThe rest, to reach the 590 million, or Roma's valuation, they financed the remaining 400 million euros of debt with JP Morgan.\nThey didn't pay them, but they shouldered them. It's very different!\nAnd they spread them over the management and subsequent financial statements, signing the settlement agreement in agreement with Ceferin, thus effectively blocking expenses and investments, paying the debt with Roma's own money, or rather with the money that Roma produces: transfers, capital gains, takings, UEFA prizes, stadium, box office, sold-out, sponsors, TV rights, merchandising... But the worst will come next season: Lukaku returns to Chelsea, Dybala sold, the poor players we have all remain and will be supported from a maximum of two other poor players that the new sports board will take in France. Next season we will return, after 45 years, to fight to save ourselves from Serie B.\nAn interesting view\n16 Posted 16/06/2024 at 14:11:01\n17 Posted 16/06/2024 at 14:11:30\nI don't always agree but you are an object lesson in how to present without hostile tantrums and melodrama exactly how the forum should be\nWell done\n18 Posted 16/06/2024 at 14:14:48\nRay #15 - that sounds like you've taken that from somewhere else (\"we will return\" etc). What's the source?\n\"...paying the debt with Roma's own money\". Alarmingly, that has the Glazers written all over it - a high level of leveraged debt, which it seems has been shifted onto the club and off the owners. If so, we should be worried. Ask any Man Utd fan.\n20 Posted 16/06/2024 at 14:25:10\nLink\n21 Posted 16/06/2024 at 14:32:55\nhttps://www.ilmessaggero.it/sport/as_roma/roma_everton_friedkin_cosa_succede_ora-8183945.html\n22 Posted 16/06/2024 at 15:15:32\nAll I want is a plan that improves our situation year on year.\nFootball-wise, that means three things:\n1. Intelligent player trading. It's going to become harder to â€˜do a Brighton' as there are very few clubs who can afford to buy players for the sums that Cucurella, Sanchez and Caicedo went for, but we have to have a scouting network and DoF who can buy players that both improve the team in the short term and could generate trading profits in the long term.\n2. Intelligent use of the free agent market. Player wage demands may be the stumbling block to this, but every year there are a few quality, experienced players who could have a positive impact but we rarely seem to take advantage.\n3. Youth Development. The big one. Obviously we have produced some very good players over the years, but I've always thought that there is still so much untapped potential on Merseyside. We also seem to fail in that crucial 18-21 age group where players need to go from promising youngsters to first team footballer. There is expertise out there, including at the FA whose programmes have improved hugely in the last decade. We don't seem to produce even decent squad players. The recent release of Lewis Warrington and McKenzie Hunt are a clear example. A couple of lower league loans and then released for nothing. I can't judge these individuals as I don't watch them much, but their careers don't seem to be managed intelligently enough. Even just giving them some first team exposure occasionally would improve them as players and increase their value for sales, but we don't seem to do it. I can't believe that they're so bad that they would have cost us points by coming on fresh in the second half of games when we were tiring. We could either raise â€˜pure profit' through sales or have a deeper squad of cheaper players who care more about the club if we get this right.\nAt the moment we seem to be fire-fighting both on and off the pitch, and we're just about managing, but it's costing us in terms of building anything for the long term. The new owners need a clear plan, which they can explain openly and honestly, about what small improvements are going to be made year on year.\nWhilst it's not what we dreamed of, it will be enough to engage me (and most Evertonians I suspect) to see that we are at least moving in the right direction. We will just have to accept that the destination is a long way off.\n23 Posted 16/06/2024 at 15:31:14\nPeter, thanks for that. That's much more reassuring! So we won't end up with the likes of the Glazers and wanting to do a defenestration job!\n24 Posted 16/06/2024 at 15:37:38\n25 Posted 16/06/2024 at 15:38:36\n26 Posted 16/06/2024 at 15:42:55\n27 Posted 16/06/2024 at 16:22:16\n28 Posted 16/06/2024 at 16:56:33\nNo investor will play Father Xmas and nor should they with PSR and FFP hovering over us.\nWe have to find a way to manage our way back to the top something that proved impossible under dumb and dumber.\n29 Posted 16/06/2024 at 17:33:18\n30 Posted 16/06/2024 at 17:51:48\nLooking forward to the fixture list for next season which is out tomorrow.\nUTFTs!\n31 Posted 16/06/2024 at 18:05:38\nJust get it sorted.\nAnd get the fixture list out so we can all start planning!\n32 Posted 16/06/2024 at 18:11:24\nHopefully, hopefully, deliverance and salvation will be soon, for Everton.\nUTFTs!\n33 Posted 16/06/2024 at 18:50:13\n34 Posted 16/06/2024 at 18:54:15\nThe ales this p.m. ( don't take too many these days) has enhanced my maths againðŸ»ðŸ»ðŸ»ðŸ˜‚ðŸ™\nUTFTs!\n35 Posted 16/06/2024 at 19:03:32\nInteresting link that. Looks like he will at least know some of the issues facing us.\nIn our case, he does not have a minority share issue to manage- or not much of one- but he is faced with a lot more debt than even Roma accrued and how that is dealt with in this acquisition will be the key to whether we can look forward to a hair shirt or something a little more comfortable. If we are forced to sell Jarrod, hair shirt it is. For me that would be a bad start.\nInteresting how it works in Italy. Some people here seem to think we can tap the state up for some investment funds for development. The local Italian government sees the money needing to come the other way.\n36 Posted 16/06/2024 at 19:03:33\nMoshiri gambled and lost big time, at least give the guy credit for trying, Friedkin its seems will probably go with the pragmatic approach.\nWith few exceptions though, position in the League is determined by how much is spent on players. How valuable the squad is.\nSo if you take that as fact we are likely to be bouncing along the bottom again this next season.\nIts going to be vital that the scouting system is much improved on recent times, thats area where we have been poor.\nIf this takeover comes to fruition we have a solvent club again and we are still in the ball game, and oh a brand new stadium.\n37 Posted 16/06/2024 at 19:39:31\nof the Friedkin takeover. There are evidently a number\nof interested parties now and I was hoping one would\nprovide a reasonably quick end to the last thirty years\nof austerity and or mismanagement. The sale of our\nprized assets is not going to achieve that. An early\nstatement from Friedkin might allay those concerns orâ€¦..\n38 Posted 16/06/2024 at 19:44:40\n39 Posted 16/06/2024 at 19:50:14\n40 Posted 16/06/2024 at 19:59:32\nBut I suspect all clubs are in the same boat, of paying too many players big contracts that they can't get rid of. And so the clubs have to wear those contracts until the situation can be addressed. Only then can you redirect cashflow into cheaper, emerging talent. Until then it's treading water.\nArsenal under Arteta did a good job in clearing the decks of very high earners - Ozil, Aubameyang, etc were successfully moved on, and he brought in better lower paid players.\n41 Posted 16/06/2024 at 22:19:39\nUnfortunately, no. That's because the wages / transfer fees in the Premier League are higher too. Also, we're in a much bigger mess than Roma.\nAnthony # 37, the article is intended to be realistic rather than negative - although I appreciate it's not a stirring read. Unfortunately, there are already 8 extremely wealthy clubs in the Premier League who we are seriously adrift of. We could spend £300m this summer and still have a weaker squad than the likes of Villa, Spurs and Newcastle. No new owners are going to come in and try to spend their way to success.\nIt might sound a bit boring, but under Moshiri relegation and insolvency had become a case of when not if. The turnaround, though not quick, at least looks like it's about to start.\n42 Posted 16/06/2024 at 22:47:11\nAs fans we'll need to be patient and pragmatic over the next couple of seasons. Moving away from relegation battles and solidifying mid table security over the course of next season and our first season at Bramley Moore.\nThe next 24 months I expect the commercial side to vastly improve as well as other areas including our academy/scouting plus the general communications from the club to trend in an upwards direction. Hopefully by the the third or fourth season at Bramley Moore we can witness some great european nights again but until then it's going to be a patient build up.\n43 Posted 17/06/2024 at 03:34:54\n44 Posted 17/06/2024 at 05:18:31\nInteresting times to follow me thinks.\nLet's hope it's not another example of Goodbye Boris, hello Liz aarrrgghhhhhh. That would be very Everton !\n45 Posted 17/06/2024 at 06:13:20\nFixtures out tomorrow.\nI struggle to think of owners in recent top flight football who aren't in it for their own interests, so I won't concern myself with that.\nHaving spent years in the States (I've been to 30 of the 50), pet hate. Stop saying Yanks.\nI will call on the American cohort to correct me, but if you call someone from from the southern states a Yank, they will likely be offended.\nThey are American.\nLet's get this one over the line and then make arrangements for the first match.\n46 Posted 17/06/2024 at 07:46:42\nInitially at Roma there was more than a hint of Moshiri about Friedkin's approach. But he seems to have learned after that.\nI don't think that things could get a whole lot worse than under Moshiri but I also don't think that Friedkin will make things a whole lot better (at least on the pitch) for a while. The thing that worries me the most is that he appointed Mourinho, who in my opinion has looked an expensive flop since his last season at United. One of the biggest flaws in Moshiri was not putting in place the right managers, board, DOFs to bring progress. Lets hope Friedkin has better judgement when it comes to appointing leaders.\n47 Posted 17/06/2024 at 08:11:59\nHopefully this turns out to be the best bid but a part of me is still very concerned that things are not what they seem.\nI hope my information is wrong but, I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if this wasn't a complete 100% buyout, when you consider everything that has gone on before, and especially in the last bemusing 12 months, that you mentioned.\n48 Posted 17/06/2024 at 08:31:53\n49 Posted 17/06/2024 at 08:35:18\nMore of the same but more organised won't get us fighting for top 10.\nI don't know enough about the details of all prospective new owners or how much they have bid for the club but joining up with the Roma owners who have just come out of their own psr mess doesn't exactly fill me with confidence.\nNew season around the corner, expectations at an all time low. Touting our best players around to the highest bidder, I am fed up with the lot of it.\n50 Posted 17/06/2024 at 09:03:14\nOr Damn Yankees if referring to the baseball team?\nTony #47, so this guy is still not your Titanic Hotel bidders?\nRob #49, or touting our players to the lowest bidder re: Branthwaite!\n51 Posted 17/06/2024 at 09:03:31\n52 Posted 17/06/2024 at 10:24:12\n53 Posted 17/06/2024 at 11:16:07\nAs you say hopefully they have learnt from their mistakes and we won't have the 3-4 year finding their feet period like Roma.\nIt's never going to be a quick fix, even with Saudi billions, PSR has seen to that.\nSustainable growth & development of the team is now what's needed.\nHe should have alot of contacts who he can call upon to enhance our weak branding, merchandisin,sponsorship and new new stadium Opportunities.\nThere's nothing wrong with prudence as long as you are making progress!\n55 Posted 17/06/2024 at 13:42:30\n56 Posted 18/06/2024 at 10:46:10\nI think there are bigger gains to be had at Everton (in terms of league position, at least) for less investment. With some squad upgrades, it's entirely possible for Everton to finish just inside the top half of the table.\nI think minor short-term upgrades, getting to the new stadium - think players coming to the end of their career (like Barry, Distin), - supported by youth/academy players bought in for the longer term 3-5 years - with a view to winning cups and European places in 5 years I imagine.\n57 Posted 18/06/2024 at 11:10:12\n58 Posted 18/06/2024 at 11:26:42\nSame people in charge?\nNot quite mate. ðŸ˜‰\n59 Posted 18/06/2024 at 13:28:36\nAs most are saying, smart recruitment and selling, are our keys to progression.\n60 Posted 18/06/2024 at 20:59:27\nHe's a business man and therefore his focus will be on making money,not necessarily developing the Football Club for the benefit of the supporters.He'll do this by growing the assets and leveraging loans against the club to dabble in other interests.I know all business consortiums have similar objectives with the possible exception of the oil states who are more concerned with “sports washing “their dodgy reputations than making money.For this reason I would prefer the AJ Bell &co,s bid.At least they are Evertonians and hopefully would have the interests of EFC at heart.\nIt would seem to me that now is the time for Kevin Thelwell to earn his corn and bring some young talent to the club at reasonable prices.Loan signings are limited in number and out of contract players rarely produce any diamonds as they are out of contract for a reason.\n61 Posted 18/06/2024 at 20:59:32\nI don't mind the new owners being tight and implementing necessary cost cutting, as long as there is a clear plan for steady, gradual, sustainable improvement.\n62 Posted 19/06/2024 at 05:52:22\n63 Posted 19/06/2024 at 21:40:00\n64 Posted 20/06/2024 at 17:50:23\nGet a good deal over a 5-10 year period, and that could transform the finances.\n65 Posted 22/06/2024 at 19:39:29\n66 Posted 24/06/2024 at 15:59:13\nOnly then will we move onwards and upwards.\n67 Posted 27/06/2024 at 13:05:36\nInteresting times ahead when the change happens.\n68 Posted 27/06/2024 at 15:07:49\nI suppose the danger time for Dyche is if we are still a Premier League club when we move to the new ground\nPersonally,I'd stick with him for 3 years but we all know, if things go pear-shaped for a period, he might be asked to leave.\n69 Posted 28/06/2024 at 19:58:07\nKids are the future of Everton Football Club â€“ get them wearing the colours.\n70 Posted 28/06/2024 at 20:12:58\nEverton are in desperate need of good management to get their house in order and this fellow has my wholehearted support to get the job done.\nI will not saddle him with a time frame â€“ he will already have one and whether we understand his blueprint for the club or not we should trust him to get it right.\nAfter all he will be like a breath of fresh air compared to the stench that the last two left us in.. There will be a much better Ah-roma around the place â€“ No shit!\n72 Posted 03/07/2024 at 20:23:13\nWe got chatting.\nI won't name the organization or role, but he has a very senior a major global operational role in a very well known major sport.\nHe's also a football fan, as well as a business man, and played in college.\nThe first thing that impressed me was that, when I told him I was from Liverpool, he didn't assume I was a red, like so many do. He asked \"Red or blue?\"\nThe second thing was that when he asked me where Everton were with ownership, and I started off by mentioning Friedkin, he said \"Oh, the Roma guy\" and he went on to say \"That will be much better for Everton, the 777 Partners things was never going to go well; Friedkin is a very good option.\"\nOkay, so it's a bit \"me nan's hairdresser's nephew met a guy in Aldi who knew someone who had given Friedkin a ride in a taxi\", but the guy was clearly a proper sports management guy; when I scanned (ie, stalked) him on LinkedIn, he had been in major roles in US sports leagues and organizations as well.\nI really hope this Friedkin deal goes through.\n73 Posted 03/07/2024 at 20:58:39\nBut I definitely understand the reticence and suspicion surrounding the process from Evertonians.\nDaring to dream has been a wiped out option for such a long time. Hope this guy can remove those shackles...\n74 Posted 03/07/2024 at 21:28:42\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
