It is a release for me.”\nWearing the No. 10 jersey once adorned by Wayne Rooney, the midfielder stooped to head in Bukayo Saka’s cross in the 13th minute. Bellingham raced away, arms outstretched in a pose Madrid fans have grown to love and Beckham has replicated on social media in tribute to a player who doesn’t turn 21 until later this month.\nBellingham has already done his talking on the field after a spectacular debut season at Madrid where he scored 23 goals, won the Spanish title and the Champions League.\nHe is also making a splash off of it.\nLike Beckham, his appeal goes far beyond soccer. Presumably that was what Kardashian knew after Bellingham was chosen to front the menswear range of her SKIMS underwear. He’s also the star of an advertising campaign for sportswear giant Adidas, which features Beckham, who is just another of Bellingham’s many fans.\nSo much, so soon for someone so young could be seen as a cause for concern.\nBut Bellingham is not your average player.\n“He writes his own script,” England manager Gareth Southgate said.\nHaving already played at the last Euros and the World Cup in 2022, Bellingham is the first European player to appear at three major international tournaments before the age of 21, according to statistician, Opta.\nHis goal was certainly the story of this game - sending England to the top of Group C after Denmark drew 1-1 with Slovenia. Christian Eriksen scored for the Danes - three years after suffering a cardiac arrest on the field at the last Euros.\nEngland plays Denmark in Frankfurt on Thursday.\nSouthgate's team might have gone into that match on the back of a bigger margin of victory, with Harry Kane coming close to scoring in the second half when Serbia goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic pushed his far post header onto the underside of the bar.\nEngland was a beaten finalist at the last Euros, losing on penalties to Italy in the final three years ago. It is one of the favorites to go one better this time around.\nBut off-field issues overshadowed the buildup to the game against Serbia, which had been deemed high risk due to concerns about violence between rival supporters. Some of those fears were realized when police rushed to separate brawling fans in Gelsenkirchen earlier in the day.\nSocial media footage showed men throwing chairs at each other outside a restaurant festooned with Serbian flags in the city.\nInside the stadium there were boos during the anthems.\nEngland fans were soon celebrating once the game got underway after Bellingham’s decisive moment.\nAnd he’s got no problem with the song supporters have attached to him.\n“I listen to the Beatles a lot. My style of music is a bit old so that is right up my street,” he said.\nOver in Hamburg, Dutch fans were also partying and turned the city into a sea of orange. The Netherlands secured a come-from-behind 2-1 win against Poland in Group D thanks to Wout Weghorst’s late goal.\nJames Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson\nEuro 2024: /hub/euro-2024\nThis article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.",
