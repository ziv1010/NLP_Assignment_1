As reported by The Telegraph, Betis are “preparing a season-long loan offer to Manchester United” after Antony’s strong performances lifted them into a Champions League position.\nThe £82 million signing from Ajax, whose Old Trafford career faltered, has rediscovered form under Manuel Pellegrini, becoming a fan favourite at Estadio Benito Villamarín.\nAntony’s Revival in Spain\nSince moving on loan in January, Antony has started every game for Betis, scoring five goals and significantly impacting their charge up La Liga. According to The Telegraph, Betis are not pursuing a permanent deal but want another loan spell for 2025/26, which “would be within their transfer budget and also keep Antony off United’s wage bill.”\nThis arrangement suits Betis, who covered 84% of Antony’s salary plus bonuses during his current loan. However, no purchase option was included in the original agreement, meaning Antony would need to report back to Carrington for pre-season unless terms are renegotiated.\nFans at Betis have embraced Antony’s flair and work rate. Veteran midfielder Isco even joked, “We have to crowdfund so he can stay at least another year. We’ve noticed a change since he arrived; he brings us a lot.” Comments like these highlight how seamlessly Antony has integrated into the Betis side.\nImplications for Manchester United\nFor Manchester United and current manager Ruben Amorim, Antony’s situation presents an interesting dilemma. Amorim, who excluded Antony from his plans earlier this season, has focused on a high-intensity, tactically disciplined squad – attributes Antony struggled to consistently display in England.\nUnited’s original investment in the winger, coupled with his resurgence abroad, complicates matters. On one hand, United could seek to rejuvenate Antony under Amorim’s guidance; on the other, another successful loan could boost his market value for a potential future sale.\nGiven the absence of a permanent transfer clause in the Betis deal, Manchester United maintain control over Antony’s destiny. But allowing Betis to shoulder his wages while he rebuilds his reputation might be seen as a win-win for all parties.\nBetis’ European Ambitions\nBetis currently sit fifth in La Liga and are well-positioned to secure Champions League football, provided they hold off competition from Villarreal and Celta Vigo. Playing Europe’s elite could further sharpen Antony’s skills and visibility.\nHis contributions have also helped Betis progress in the Europa Conference League, where a mouth-watering final against Chelsea remains a possibility. Few at Betis would deny that Antony’s dynamic performances have been pivotal in their late-season surge.\nWhile United’s initial £82 million outlay looks unlikely to be recouped any time soon, allowing Antony to flourish at Betis, even temporarily, could help both clubs in the long run.\nOur View – EPL Index Analysis\nAs a Manchester United supporter, it is bittersweet to see Antony thriving away from Old Trafford. There’s no denying the lad’s talent – we saw glimpses of it during his early days under Erik ten Hag. Yet, his time at United was marred by inconsistency, off-field distractions, and an inability to adapt to the Premier League’s physicality.\nWith Ruben Amorim now at the helm, there is a clear shift towards hardworking, tactically astute players. Antony’s flair was never in question, but his decision-making, defensive contribution, and work rate were areas of concern. Amorim’s decision to move him out was probably necessary for squad harmony and tactical clarity.\nStill, it’s frustrating. United fans crave creativity and flair, and when Antony is on form, he brings exactly that. Watching him light up La Liga with Betis feels like a missed opportunity, but perhaps a full season under Pellegrini, with Champions League football, could be the final polish Antony needs.\nThe key now is patience and smart business. If Betis can cover his wages again and Antony keeps progressing, his market value will rise. Then, United can either reintegrate him as a more complete player – or cash in at a more favourable price.\nFor now, it’s best for all involved that Antony stays in Spain, builds his confidence, and shows the world the player we all hoped he would become at Old Trafford.",
