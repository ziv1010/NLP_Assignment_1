Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘But they aren’t going to give him a war chest in his first transfer window, they’ll want to see what he brings first. I think they’ll make one or two signings this month just to give Liam some of his own players.\n‘Liam and everyone at the club knows that Chelsea already have a brilliant squad, and we have seen glimpses of how good they can be under Maresca earlier in the season.\n‘So, I think Liam’s job is to get the team back to that kind of form. He needs to get the players all enjoying their football again and then achieve positive results consistently.\n‘Once he has them in good form, they’ll be extremely hard to beat with the talent they have all over the pitch.\n‘They have a really nice blend of older, more experienced players and youth throughout the squad, and every player is talented.\n‘They’ve been ruthless in offloading and isolating players, and I think they have one of the strongest squads in the league.\n‘However, Liam has to get them winning now, that’s the only thing he will be focusing on, and any transfer business will be a bonus for him.’\nOne of Chelsea’s main January targets is Rennes centre-back Jeremy Jacquet, who is also being monitored by Arsenal.\nBut Chelsea appear to be leading the race to sign the future France international, having agreed personal terms with the player ahead of negotiations with Rennes.\nChelsea have so far shown a reluctance to pay over £50m for Jacquet but Rennes, currently sixth in Ligue 1, want around £56m to sanction his departure.\nWho could leave Chelsea this month?\nWhile Chelsea are yet to make any January signings, they have offloaded loanee Facundo Buonanotte following his underwhelming spell in west London.\nChelsea paid a loan fee to sign Buonanotte from Brighton last summer but he has now returned to his parent club ahead of a summer move to Leeds United.\nThe Blues, currently sixth in the Premier League, are open to offers for Raheem Sterling and Axel Disasi but have struggled to offload two members of Maresca’s ‘bomb squad’.\nSterling won four Premier League titles at Manchester City but has struggled since his £50m move to Stamford Bridge in 2022.\nThe 31-year-old winger hoped to revive his career on loan at Arsenal last season but only contributed one goal for the Gunners in 28 appearances in all competitions.\nAsked where Sterling could end up, Johnson added: ‘I’m not sure where I see Raheem’s next move in football being. We have been talking about him for a few years now in this way, and he is still at Chelsea.\n‘He has 18 months left on his contract, so it will all depend on what he wants as to where his next move is. He could just see his contract out, but I think he will want to get back playing again as soon as possible.\n‘As for the move, I’m not sure. I think if he wants to push to go to the World Cup, then he needs to play consistently in the Premier League.\n‘However, he might be sick of the relentless fight in the Premier League at this stage in his career and potentially move somewhere less competitive.\nMore Trending\n‘It completely depends on where his head is at. I am such a big fan of Sterling, and I always have been. I’ve been saying for years that I think he has got loads to give at the highest level of football.\n‘I think it would be a shame if he moved abroad to the MLS or Saudi Arabia right now. I would love to see him do a few more years in the Premier League before winding down his career.’\nChelsea face a crucial Champions League game against Pafos on Wednesday before returning to Premier League action at the weekend against London rivals Crystal Palace.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Arsenal eye move for Real Madrid defender after Gunners miss out on £56m Chelsea target\nMORE: Tottenham make Thomas Frank decision before Champions League clash\nMORE: Manchester United make decision on Joshua Zirkzee deal, confirms Roma chief",
