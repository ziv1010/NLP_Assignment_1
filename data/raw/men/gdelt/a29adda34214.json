They are between six and eight years old and all play for La Castellane, the community club created by the local hero and named after the neighbourhood where he grew up playing between high-rise blocks. They are told by their coach to stand up straight and clasp their hands behind their backs.\nAdvertisement\nThe boys break the silence with a chorus of gasps. This icon, who carries his charisma with languid cool, walks into their line of vision. With that infamous bald head and angular cheekbones, he is unmissable. “How are you?” he asks, leaning down to high-five each of the kids. “Zidane!” squeaks one. They cannot believe their eyes.\nThere has always been something other-worldly about Zinedine Zidane. He was not an ordinary footballer. His game existed in a more creative sphere than most could ever imagine. He saw passes, interpreted moves and chose touches that were deceptive and unusual. The ball was his muse, he was the impressionist.\nObserving Zidane do his thing live in the stadium felt utterly mesmeric. A friend once described it like this: “Watching Zidane is like falling in love.” Nobody says it quite like the French.\nWhen the conversations come up about best players and favourite players, he qualifies for any debate. There is a significant difference between choosing a best or favourite player. Bests can be backed up by facts, statistics, medals and so on. Favourites are something else. Favourites touch the soul and feel more personal. It is not necessary to explain or ‘win’ an argument — if it is your favourite, it is your favourite.\nFull disclosure: Zidane just might be mine.\nElsewhere on The Athletic…\nA stroke of fortune enabled me to follow Les Bleus at every international tournament he embellished, including the zenith of the 1998 World Cup final, the nadir of the headbutt in 2006, and everything in between. It felt like a moral duty to study Zidane and the cadences of his career. What a waste not to.\nIt started at Elland Road. Euro 96. France v Spain. A first proper look. Already attention was drawn to this maverick who had made waves with Bordeaux and was chosen to join Juventus after the Euros. How good was he? This was his first major international tournament, during which he turned 24, certainly not young by the standards of greats who won a World Cup in their teens (Pele and Kylian Mbappe) or wept to be unfairly unselected as his team triumphed at the same precocious age (Diego Maradona). It was not a special tournament for Zidane or France. They were mediocre compared to the standards they would soon set.\nAdvertisement\nWhat happened next was immense. A World Cup at home, a first triumph for the nation, an explosion of happiness that unified the country and had socio-political significance that rippled from the stadium out to every big city, every traditional village, every banlieue which was home to immigrants such as Zidane’s parents from northern Algeria. He was the poster boy for something bigger than football. He scored twice in the final to defeat Brazil. His face lit up the Arc de Triomphe in Paris as the crowds chanted “Zizou President”. It is exactly 25 years since that unforgettable night. Zidane is commemorating the anniversary by inviting some of his old team-mates to a celebration at Z5, to reflect on a moment that changed all their lives.\nOn we go to Euro 2000, where France beat Italy in the final. The tournament was Zidane’s apotheosis in terms of the purity of his playing. The team had matured, able to perform with the swagger of established winners, and Zidane at the heart of it made astonishing football look completely natural.\nAfter the semi-final against Portugal, won by Zidane in the dramatically super-charged last moments of the game with a penalty, it was time for me to try to write some kind of ‘definitive’ ode to the player of the tournament, to be published on the day of the final. Sitting in a tiny, stuffily hot hotel room in Amsterdam, the search was on for some words to attempt to sum up his greatness: “There is a reason Zidane suffers from premature baldness. It is a sign from above that he is actually human.” Honestly, it was meant as an unequivocal compliment.\nSo, you get the gist about the meaning of Zizou to this particular writer. It was not only the boys in the semi-circle on a pitch in Aix-en-Provence who were full of anticipation about finally meeting Zidane.\nToday, Zidane’s football life exists around the edges. He has not been involved in the daily intensity of working in the game for just over two years since he ended his second coaching term at Real Madrid. He is beginning to feel the itch to get involved again. He misses the adrenaline, the competition and edge that only a football life brings. But he is not yet ready to make a big announcement about where his future lies, where he could grace the game again.\nAdvertisement\nNever mind the dugout, he still misses the pitch. He comes to life when he contemplates what he would think about in the instances of a match in real-time. When the ball drops in the Champions League final, or the corner is dipping towards him at the World Cup final, did he have time to think, to anticipate, to make a decision about what he would do next?\n“When I am on the pitch it is instinctive,” he says. “I didn’t have special rituals. I didn’t feel the pressure. I was just happy to be there on the pitch and to play in front of 50 or 80,000 people. It was my dream since I was little. To come out and play in front of 80,000 people? Imagine that! That’s what’s incredible.\n“I want to explain why. This summer we have an international match for the French team after the end of the season. It’s such a long, tiring season, playing every three days, playing Champions League. It’s very difficult to get back into it. What enables you to stay connected is walking onto the pitch and seeing all those people. When you see thousands of people, that’s what does it for you. It re-energises you. It’s the beauty of sport, this passion that exists around football.”\nHis mental relationship with the game is fascinating. A memorable vignette that was more about fortitude than footwork came in Euro 2000, at the climax of the semi-finals. France were going for an international double. With the score level and deep in extra time, a break fell to Sylvain Wiltord who smashed an angled ball goalwards only for defender Abel Xavier to palm it behind. The award of a French penalty sparked bedlam, with Portuguese players haranguing the referee, threatening to walk off and creating a brouhaha that continued for several minutes.\nThroughout the chaos, Zidane stood alone with the ball like a zen master. He was a picture of serenity at the centre of the storm. Waiting. Impenetrable. In his own solitary zone. “The time between the foul and actually taking the penalty was four or five minutes,” he recalls. “That was a long four or five minutes! I stayed in my bubble. Sometimes there are things you can’t explain. But I know what I’m going to do. As far as everything else is concerned, I stay in my bubble. I stay concentrated.\n“A player came up to talk to me, but it was like he wasn’t even talking. Sometimes you have a team-mate who comes over: ‘This goalkeeper always dives to the right’. I don’t listen. I don’t listen because I’m the one who’s going to shoot. It’s my responsibility. It’s me who knows what I have to do. It’s not for someone else to tell me what I have to do.” He spanked the penalty into the top corner with single-minded accuracy. Such cool focus, in the midst of so much boiling emotion, was strangely beautiful.\n🇫🇷 Zinédine Zidane's 117th-minute penalty gave France a golden goal victory against Portugal #OTD at EURO 2000!\n⏪ @equipedefrance pic.twitter.com/It8K4wRrLR\n— UEFA EURO 2024 (@EURO2024) June 28, 2020\nZidane still plays occasionally for fun. “But less and less, honestly. Because physically I am not at the top. It’s tough!” So he engages more by watching, which sustains his appetite for the game. “I like watching loads of matches, lots of players. I look for players who could develop and succeed.” During his hiatus, his brain is ticking over with the game’s intricacies and possibilities. Of all the things that stand out to Zidane when he is watching matches on television, the thing he says makes the biggest impression is surprising.\nAdvertisement\n“There are a lot of players I like,” he says, “But in general what impresses me is the physical fitness necessary now. The demands are to play every three days. It’s different to my era when, if you had a physical problem, you could compensate with your technique. It’s not the same. You really need to be physically prepared, a top athlete. You need both physicality and technique.” A master creator, a master technician, struck by the athleticism of the game, which was not one of his most obvious weapons (not that he was in any way underpowered).\nZidane is in the mood to contemplate the evolution of football because of his role as ambassador for EA SPORTS. It is introducing a library of coaching videos in six different languages as an offshoot of its video game for next season (what used to be known as FIFA has been rebranded as FC24). FC Futures, the company’s initiative committed to investing $10million (£7.8m; €9.1m) into community football worldwide, set up for the day at Z5 to explain the plan. Theoretically, wherever you are, you can access these clips to learn and take tips and lessons outside to practise. They will be available online for free.\nGO DEEPER\nThe Marseille streets that paved the way to stardom for Cantona and Zidane\nIt is certainly a different perspective to the message youth coaches often preached in recent years, lamenting how gaming robs young players of valuable playing time and ball contact out in the streets and parks that used to be the norm in a pre-electronic age. Zidane suggests we have to change with the times.\n“When we were kids, it was just a little pitch, on concrete, no cage, bibs for goalposts. Football today is a different world. The same passion, but it’s a different scenario. Kids play on PlayStation and you hear: ‘Oh, they’re always on their console!’ But no, it’s good. It’s almost reality for them. When you play, you almost have the feeling you are on the pitch. You shouldn’t overlook that. It’s just the kids’ way of getting into it. So if they like it, they should be allowed to because their life outside is difficult in certain neighbourhoods. Today’s generation has its own way. You just want kids to still find wonder in what’s happening.”\nZidane was a player whose technique and imagination worked in perfect tandem. He was a team player but was granted the freedom to be inventive. Is it possible to coach imagination?\n“No,” says Zidane. “For me, imagination is an instinct. It has to be instinctive. Often young players are taught to shoot like this, pass like that. They’re formatted. Today the kids between eight and 10 should play for fun. Sometimes, you need to show them little technical things because they need solid foundations. But beyond that, no. Their imagination is just that — it has to be instinctive. They have to have fun.”\nThey are doing that at the Z5 complex when Zidane is joined by his old friend and team-mate David Beckham, who walks in, points at Zidane and proclaims: “The master!”. The ex-pros split up and have a kickaround with the youngsters. The old boys still have it. In spades.\nZidane has now opened three sports facilities, one in Aix and another in Istres, a few kilometres west of Marseille. There is another in Turin, a reflection of his time in Italy. The complex in Aix has seven astro pitches all named after famous stadia (although elodrome has temporarily lost its V). There are also padel courts, a dance studio, a restaurant, a creche and so on. It is a hive of community sports.\nThis flagship centre was opened on Zidane’s birthday and is decorated with some fantastic memorabilia from his playing career. He is quite the collector. Maybe more sentimental than we might imagine. Seeing the collection of shirts and trophies, gifts from Pele, Maradona and Franz Beckenbauer, photos of his successful teams, the memories are still so vivid. With so much achievement to look back on, it’s easy to gloss over the sacrifices, the misses, the losses that come with the territory of an elite career. The downs give meaning to the highest points.\nAdvertisement\nRemember the World Cup in 2002, when Zidane was injured and played only in the third group game, his leg strapped. It was all too late and France went out early as embarrassed holders. Remember the rollercoaster of 2006, when Zidane came out of retirement to melt French hearts all over again with his exquisite performances against Spain and Brazil, before the shock of the headbutt in the final.\nHere’s the thing. Whether it is from a video game, a coach, or experience on the streets, as well as practice and ideas, young players also need to learn resilience and mental strength.\nI unfold a relic from the golden days: a team sheet from the 1998 World Cup final, kept flat in a cardboard folder with a bunch from other matches of that vintage. The plan was for Zidane to autograph it, but when he saw it and his face lit up, that changed. He appeared transported by a memento from his finest hour and a half.\n“Is that for me?” he asked.\nIt is not often any of us have anything of value to reflect our thanks for the pleasure our favourites have given to us. What a thing. Zidane promised to frame it and put it somewhere special.\n(Top photo: Nicolas Tucat/AFP via Getty Images; design: Sam Richardson)",
