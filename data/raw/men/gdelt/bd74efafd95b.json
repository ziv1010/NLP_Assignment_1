Appearance and goal tallies are correct as of the end of the 2024-25 season.\n10: Micky van de Ven – £34.5m\n- Year: 2023\n- Signed from: Wolfsburg\n- Appearances: 51\n- Goals: 3\nIf his dodgy hamstrings stay intact there is doubt that the Dutchman could become a club legend in north London.\nVan de Ven has speed to burn and a tremendous ability to read the game as well, while he also showcased in his first season with the club the ability to play as a marauding left-back.\nAll those expectations ended up being slightly tempered in his second season when the hamstring issues struck again, but Van de Ven once again showed his qualities on the biggest stage when his display in the Europa League final – including that incredible goal-line clearance – helped guide the club to their first trophy in 17 years.\n⬇️ DON’T MISS ⬇️\nAll the done deals by Premier League clubs in the summer 2025 transfer window\n9: Pedro Porro – £40m\n- Year: 2023\n- Signed from: Sporting CP\n- Appearances: 105\n- Goals: 11\nFormer Spurs boss Tim Sherwood’s initial diagnosis after Porro’s first start for Tottenham in a 4-1 mauling at Leicester was that he was ‘so bad it’s unbelievable’. But the Spaniard has come a long way since then.\nPorro had a slight dip in form this season after making big leaps in Postecoglou’s first season in charge, scoring four times and adding nine assists.\nBarcelona have recently been linked with a move for the 25-year-old but he will almost certainly be Spurs’s starting right-back again when the 2025/26 campaign rolls around.\n8: James Maddison – £40m\n- Year: 2023\n- Signed from: Leicester City\n- Appearances: 75\n- Goals: 16\nAnother mixed bag of a season for the former Leicester City man, who has been in and out of the side but has once shown real flashes of his undoubted genius.\nMaddison has scored 16 goals and provided 21 assists through his first 75 games for the club, figures that are not to be sniffed at. However, he’s often been the subject of fan and pundit criticism over his inconsistent performances.\nThe 28-year-old’s absence from the Europa League final was felt for a Tottenham side that lacked any real creativity despite the victory in Bilbao, and Maddison will be looking to start the new campaign fully fit and firing.\n7: Davinson Sanchez – £42m\n- Year: 2017\n- Signed from: Ajax\n- Appearances: 207\n- Goals: 5\nSanchez was the club’s record signing when the arrived from Ajax back in 2017 but ultimately disappointed after spending six years in north London.\nThe Colombian actually started his career at Tottenham strongly as he played in the middle of a back three with the ever-reliable Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld either side of him.\nHowever, he was not as comfortable in a four and often looked uncomfortable and clumsy in possession.\nIt was no great surprise when he left for Galatasaray in September 2023, although that should have probably come much sooner given his lack of playing time over the previous few campaigns.\n⬇️ READ MORE ⬇️\nEvery completed Tottenham transfer in summer 2025: Signings, exits, loans\n6: Cristian Romero – £42m\n- Year: 2022\n- Signed from: Atalanta\n- Appearances: 124\n- Goals: 7\nHard to imagine that Romero actually cost the same as Sanchez, given how their respective Tottenham careers have gone.\nIn truth, Romero has been somewhat of a disappointment with his performance levels this season, although he did show up when the club needed him most in the Europa League final – earning the Man of the Match award in the process.\nWhile reports have continued to link the Argentine with a move to Spain, Fabrizio Romano has recently revealed that a move to LaLiga for Romero is not happening.\nTo that end, it looks like Frank will be able to utilise the pairing of Romero and Van de Ven to start to the new campaign.\n5: Brennan Johnson – £47.5m\n- Year: 2023\n- Signed from: Nottingham Forest\n- Appearances: 85\n- Goals: 23\nAfter an up-and-down first season at Tottenham, Johnson made major leaps forward this season.\nThe Wales international finished as the club’s top scorer with 18 goals, while also laying on seven assists in 51 appearances in all competitions.\nThere are elements of his all-round game that need to improve but Johnson is starting to show why the club forked out big money for his services in the first place.\n4: Mohammed Kudus – £55m\n- Year: 2025\n- Signed from: West Ham United\n- Appearances: N/A\n- Goals: N/A\nHaving failed with previous offers, Tottenham finally get Kudus on board on July 10, with the Ghana international penning a six-year contract in north London.\nThe 24-year-old will offer Frank great flexibility in his forward line, although his favourite position is a right-sided forward. That puts Brennan Johnson’s place under immediate threat, assuming that Dejan Kulusevski is used in a No.10 role next season.\nAfter a stunning first season at West Ham, Kudus dropped off last term as the Hammers struggled badly down at the wrong end of the table.\nHowever, he has made all the right noises since making the switch to Spurs and could be a dynamic presence for the club going forward.\n3: Richarlison – £60m\n- Year: 2022\n- Signed from: Everton\n- Appearances: 90\n-\nGoals: 20\nThe Brazilian continues to frustrate in north London, enduring another campaign of niggling injury absences that saw him score just five goals this season.\nRicharlison actually showed some improvement during the 2023/24 campaign but the arrival of Dominic Solanke saw him largely relegated to bench duty again – when he was actually fit.\nHe did feature more towards the end of the season playing on the left-wing but continues to be the subject of interest from top clubs in Saudi Arabia.\n2: Tanguy Ndombele – £63m\n- Year: 2019\n- Signed from: Lyon\n- Appearances: 91\n- Goals: 10\nThree words: Waste of money. Another three: Waste of talent.\nNdombele looked a rare talent when arrived in a huge deal by Tottenham standards back in 2019 after the disappointment of the Champions League final loss to Liverpool.\nIn total he made just 91 appearances for the club, scoring 10 goals and was loaned out to Lyon, Napoli and Galatasaray.\nThe 27-year-old is now back in his homeland at Nice, after being released from his Tottenham contract with one year left remaining, and scored two goals with two assists this season.\n1: Dominic Solanke – £65m\n- Year: 2024\n- Signed from: Bournemouth\n- Appearances: 45\n- Goals: 16\nSolanke became the club’s record capture last summer after previously excelling down on the south coast with Bournemouth.\nThe England forward had a mixed bag of a first season with the club that included four niggling injuries that cost him some game time.\nThe 27-year-old still managed to chalk up 16 goals and eight assists in 45 games, including nine G/A in the club’s Europa League success.\nSolanke’s all-round game also impressed in what ended up being a taster of what he could bring to the side if he can stay fully fit for seasons ahead.",
