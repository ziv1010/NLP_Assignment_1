It has been a great privilege.”\nThe chances of Messi returning to his former club Barcelona appear to be fading.\nOne possible destination is Saudi Arabia, where he would join his former Real Madrid sparring partner Cristiano Ronaldo in a deal potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\nRelated Posts\nShort URL: https://www.africanexaminer.com/?p=88403",
