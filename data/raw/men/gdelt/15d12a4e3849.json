Luis Enrique’s side showcased their high-pressing, fast-paced, vertical style to devastating effect in a 4-0 demolition of Real Madridin the semi-finals. Two early turnovers, forced by PSG’s relentless press, led to a commanding two-goal lead within nine minutes.\nThe Parisians, fresh off their maiden Champions League triumph last month, are chasing their first world title.\nManager Luis Enrique has revitalised the team, replacing departing stars Neymar, Lionel Messiand Kylian Mbappewith a youthful, dynamic squad committed to his total football ethos.\nMidfield orchestrator Vitinhahas been pivotal, while flying fullbacks Nuno Mendesand Achraf Hakimiprovide width and pace. Up front, Ballon d’Or contender Ousmane Dembelehas shone, delivering crucial goals and assists.\nPSG’s defensive solidity has also been remarkable, with their high turnover rate – averaging seven per hour of play – proving instrumental throughout the competition.\nLuis Enrique, who has already experienced glory leading Barcelona to a treble a decade ago, has never lost a one-off club final, winning 11 of 11.\nChelsea, meanwhile, have taken the longer road to the final, arriving in the U.S. after winning Europe’s third-tier Conference League following a sub-par domestic campaign in which they barely managed a top-four Premier League finish.\nChelsea have rallied in the tournament and the final gives manager Enzo Maresca a chance for redemption after being questioned due to struggles with a squad that cost Chelsea over 1 billion euros ($1.17 billion) in recent years.\nThe mid-tournament addition of Joao Pedrohas proven inspired, with the Brazilian forward netting twice in their semi-final win over his childhood team Fluminense.\nHe has combined well with Cole Palmerin attack, while Chelsea’s midfield trio of Enzo Fernandez, Romeo Laviaand Moises Caicedohas excelled at breaking up play and exploiting spaces.",
