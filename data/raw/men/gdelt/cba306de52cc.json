  "body_text": "Presumably, Pep Guardiola will appreciate the story about one of the more bizarre exchanges for Alex Ferguson in the summer after Manchester United had won the treble. It was, after all, Dwight Yorke’s own “Football… bloody hell” moment.\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer’s stoppage-time goal had won the European Cup in the most dramatic circumstances. United had already secured the Premier League title and FA Cup that season. It was the summer of 1999 and, back then, they were haughty enough to think no other club in English football, let alone Manchester City (who had just scrambled out of the third tier via a penalty shootout in a play-off final they were losing 2-0 after 86 minutes), would emulate their achievement.\nAdvertisement\nAnd Yorke, by his own admission, returned to Manchester after weeks of partying with a different outlook.\n“I can remember wondering what on earth my targets should be,” he says. “What else could I hope to achieve after such a momentous year?”\nIn the first week of pre-season training, Yorke went to see United manager Ferguson and asked if he could make a special request. The striker wanted to know if it was possible for him to take a year off. And, if it was OK with the club, would they continue paying his salary in full throughout that time?\n“What else is there after winning the treble?” says Yorke, recalling the conversation. “I was on such a high. I remember going to New York on Concorde that summer and thinking, ‘What more is there to achieve after this?’.\n“So I went to see the gaffer: ‘Gaffer. What are we doing? After you win the treble, there is nothing else to do. Can I have a year off from football, with pay, and then I’ll come back next year and rejoin the team?’.\n“I don’t know what made me think that (would be accepted). I just thought, ‘What more can we possibly do?’. If you don’t repeat it (the treble), you’re deemed a failure.\n“He told me to eff off. It was kind of (said) jokingly, but if he had said to me, ‘Take a year off’, I’d have taken it.”\nIt is a true story and, when Yorke repeated it on United’s official podcast a few years ago, then-United team-mate David May joked that he was surprised Ferguson did not respond by firing him. Yorke wonders, on reflection, whether Ferguson realised he was being totally serious with his request.\nIt is also a reminder that Guardiola may encounter some challenges of his own when it comes to the players who completed City’s treble last season and have, through their collective brilliance, changed the landscape of English football in recent seasons.\nAdvertisement\nNobody, it is fair to assume, will ask Guardiola for a 12-month sabbatical on full pay in the next few weeks. But there is the issue of how to keep players fully motivated when they have achieved something so special.\nWhat are the dangers of complacency? How do clubs avoid the Dwight Yorke Effect?\nWhen Guardiola was asked on City’s recent pre-season visit to Japan whether, psychologically, winning the treble might change something, he replied that it was too early to know.\nThere was one admission, however, that told us a lot about his own wiring and how even the greatest of managers can have moments of insecurity.\n“I live with incredible doubts in my head,” he said.\nBut the lesson of history is that Guardiola, like all the genuine greats of his profession, is acutely aware that complacency is the corrosive byproduct of repeated success. It is part of the battle. He knows because, as a player for Barcelona, he has been in that position himself.\n“I won four titles in a row as a player (from 1991-94),” he recalled earlier this year. “(Then) The fifth one, I was not the same. The sixth one, I was not the same. I was not starving enough. (It was all) caviar! ‘How good am I?!’. Madrid beat us to the fifth and sixth (Sort of. Real were La Liga champions in 1994-95, Atletico in 1995-96). So I understand them (City’s players), but I am here to make them do it.”\nGuardiola’s pointed description of his players as “happy flowers” was delivered on the same day. Usually a fierce protector of his own, it was a deliberate strategy to spark a reaction. Arsenal were top of the table at the time and Guardiola was alarmed by how hungry Mikel Arteta’s side seemed for success.\nHis own players, he felt, did not seem to have that same fire. Had they lost their edge after four Premier League titles in five years? Were they too accustomed to winning?\nAdvertisement\nMarti Perarnau, the Catalan writer, recognises these anxieties from the years he has spent with Guardiola documenting the manager’s work at Bayern Munich and, before that, Barcelona.\n“Pep once said that the thing that concerned him most was to see the excitement disappearing from the eyes of his players,” says Perarnau, author of three books on Guardiola’s coaching philosophies.\n“When he spoke about the ‘happy flowers’, that means that if there are players who feel they have already achieved everything, they will train with less interest and play with a little less intensity. That will lead to difficulties in competing for every trophy, which is always Pep’s objective.\nGO DEEPER\nPep Guardiola: The man behind the genius\n“That is why, after a great triumph, a treble, he considers it necessary to make two, three, four changes, so players arrive who are very motivated to win. It is like filling up the car again with petrol to be able to keep driving fast.”\nPerhaps the best way to analyse this element of Guardiola’s work is by looking at City’s team when they came from 2-0 down to beat Aston Villa and win that fourth Premier League out of five on May 22 last year: Ederson; John Stones, Fernandinho (Oleksandr Zinchenko, 45), Aymeric Laporte, Joao Cancelo; Kevin De Bruyne, Rodri, Bernardo Silva (Ilkay Gundogan, 68), Riyad Mahrez (Raheem Sterling, 56), Phil Foden, Gabriel Jesus.\nFourteen months later, six of those 14 players have left: Fernandinho, Zinchenko, Gundogan, Mahrez, Sterling and Jesus. A seventh, Cancelo, remains available for transfer, having returned from his loan spell at Bayern for the second half of last season — and the sooner he leaves the better in Guardiola’s eyes.\n“At City, we’ve seen how Pep has renewed the squad each season,” says Perarnau. “Every year, an important veteran has left: Pablo Zabaleta, Yaya Toure, Vincent Kompany, David Silva, Sergio Aguero, Fernandinho. Players who have performed really well have left during these years, and been replaced by others of a different profile.\nAdvertisement\n“That way, Pep has shaken up the dressing room each year, and that has brought freshness and new energy. Not necessarily better players, but different.”\nDavid Beckham can still remember the party of all parties after Manchester United’s almost improbable comeback, from 1-0 down in stoppage time, to beat Bayern in that 1999 European Cup final.\nMore than anything, however, he recalls Ferguson going to work immediately to make sure his players did not ease off the gas.\n“His leadership, and his mentality, wasn’t just to win it one year,” says Beckham. “We had a great night but I remember, late on, he turned to us and said, ‘You can enjoy tonight but then we go again’. He never let us sit on the trophies we won.”\nOn the face of it, this might seem like one of Ferguson’s great qualities.\nIn that treble season, it was not until the final week that United saw off Arsenal, who finished one point behind with a goal difference only one worse than theirs, to confirm themselves as domestic champions. The following year, they romped home with an 18-point lead over the same club (Yorke, to give him his due, scored 23 times in all competitions). The year after that, Arsene Wenger and company were 10 points adrift of their Old Trafford rivals.\nInside the camp, however, there was intense frustration that United did not reach another Champions League final for nine years. After one exit from Europe’s elite club competition, their captain, Roy Keane, went public to question the team’s hunger. He followed it up in his autobiography, published after a trophyless 2001-02 season, by asking whether some players at United had lost their drive because of “Rolexes, cars and mansions”.\nGary Neville, that side’s right-back, made another admission in his autobiography. “There’s no denying that United failed to build on the treble, at least where the Champions League was concerned,” he wrote. “What a mistake that was — one of the biggest in my time at the club. We were champions of England and Europe. But we had the chance to build a dynasty, and we squandered it.”\nAdvertisement\nNeville’s analysis was that United, who were linked with but did not sign Ronaldinho and Gabriel Batistuta, needed to bring in some elite players to keep everyone fresh: “Roy went public and said some slacked after the treble. He was probably right… we won the league so easily in 2000, and again in 2001, and when you are that far ahead it’s hard not to become a little complacent. If it is possible to be bored as you win the league, then we were bored in those two seasons after winning the treble.”\nYorke, in particular, seemed to be suffering from a case of blurred priorities given that he was found sleeping by the pitch during one training session on a pre-season trip to Australia.\nRio Ferdinand tells another story about joining the club from Leeds United in the summer of 2002 and Yorke showing him around the training complex. Ferguson saw them together and summoned the new signing to his office.\n“It was like the headteacher calling you at school on your first day,” Ferdinand recalled. “He went, ‘Do you want to be here a long time?’. I said, ‘Yeah, I want to win everything and I want to do as well as I can, boss’. He said, ‘Well, the first thing you should probably think about is not hanging around with him (Yorke), because he ain’t going to be here. He was unbelievable, he won everything, but he’s complacent now’.”\nFor a manager in this position, perhaps the key is to go with what Guardiola calls “the feeling” or “the smell”.\nIn the summer of 2009, Barcelona had just won their own treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey (the Spanish Cup) and Champions League under Guardiola’s management. Then, like now at City, he had asked for all sorts of changes for the following season before heading off on holiday.\nFor one, he wanted the table he sat behind when appearing in the media room at the Camp Nou replaced. It wasn’t – and when Guardiola returned to work in the July, he banged his knee as he squeezed in to sit down for his first news conference.\nAdvertisement\nBy that stage, it was already clear he was planning what many thought was unthinkable: moving out Samuel Eto’o, one of the heroes of their treble months earlier.\n“My nose told me the team needed a change,” Guardiola explained to reporters. “It’s my call. If it goes badly, get your pens ready, you’ll know who to write about. I get that it is difficult to understand. It’s just a question of ‘feeling’, of my nose. After winning, you have to change, I know that from my experience as a player. The easiest thing would be not to touch anything.”\nIt was controversial, to say the least.\nGuardiola’s relationship with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Eto’o’s replacement, ended in a spectacular fallout. Eto’o did not fit into Guardiola’s wishes to control everything. But neither did Ibrahimovic and, financially, it was a calamity for Barcelona, who sold Eto’o to Inter Milan for €20million, paid €70m to bring Ibrahimovic the other way and ended up selling him to AC Milan for €24m after just one season playing for them.\nYet Barca won the Spanish title again in 2010 with a then-record 99 points. They also made it six trophies in the calendar year of 2009, adding the Spanish and UEFA Super Cups before beating Estudiantes, of Argentina, in the Club World Cup final.\nThe following summer, Ibrahimovic, Yaya Toure, Thierry Henry and Rafa Marquez left and David Villa, Javier Mascherano and Ibrahim Afellay arrived. Barca went on to beat Manchester United in the 2010-11 Champions League final and held off Real Madrid to take a third successive domestic title by a four-point margin.\nGuardiola’s secret, it seems, is to stay one step ahead. He also likes to keep everyone on their toes. It is part of what makes him so brilliant, changing and evolving an elite team without any obvious deterioration.\nFor City, that has involved Mahrez leaving for Saudi Arabia and being open to allowing Bernardo and Kyle Walker to pursue challenges elsewhere. Mateo Kovacic has arrived from Chelsea to replace Gundogan, now of Barcelona after a free-agent move. Josko Gvardiol, another Croatia international, could follow if a deal can be arranged with RB Leipzig.\nGuardiola is never too alarmed by the prospect of refreshing a winning team.\nGO DEEPER\nGuardiola's evolution: From half-backs and false nines to backs staying back and Haaland\nAnd, besides, it is wrong to say that a collection of football A-listers, featuring serious and dedicated professionals such as De Bruyne and Erling Haaland, will find it hard to be motivated if the next challenge is to turn first-time European Cup winners into serial champions of the continent.\nThe new season starts with the Community Shield against Arsenal at Wembley on Sunday.\nAdvertisement\nThe Super Cup against Europa League winners Sevilla is in Athens on August 16 and the Club World Cup takes place in Saudi Arabia from December 12-22 (City and November’s winners of South America’s Champions League equivalent, the Copa Libertadores, getting byes to the semi-finals).\nThat alone should inspire Guardiola’s treble-winners, given no team in history, other than his Barca side in 2009, have won six such trophies in a calendar year.\nGuardiola was 38 then and one line, in particular, stands out from his team talk on the night against Estudiantes in Abu Dhabi when Lionel Messi, Xavi, Sergio Busquets et al made it a clean sweep.\n“If we lose today, we will still be the best team in the world,” he told his players. “If we win, we will be eternal.”\n(Top photos: Oli Scarff/AFP via Getty Images; ANP via Getty Images; Marvin Ibo Guengoer – GES Sportfoto/Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)",
