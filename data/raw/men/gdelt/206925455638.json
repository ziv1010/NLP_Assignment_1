Inevitably, there was more. “But I am a firm believer that even in the most difficult scenario you can still do something and achieve something beautiful in the end.”\nAdvertisement\nDias is known for his relentlessly positive outlook, once saying of City’s defeat by Chelsea in the 2021 Champions League final, “A wise man once said to me, we didn’t lose the final, we just got one step closer.”\nThat was en route to City’s treble success in 2023, when they did go on to become European champions for the first time, but on Tuesday night they face the ‘Kings of Europe’, Real Madrid, in a play-off spot simply to reach the last 16 of this year’s competition.\nFollowing captain Kyle Walker’s loan to Milan in the transfer window, Dias has been promoted to City’s vice-captain, and when he returned from injury against Leyton Orient in the FA Cup on Saturday he made his 200th appearance for the club.\nIn that time he has become the foundation of Pep Guardiola’s defence; he finished 23rd in the Ballon d’Or standings, seven places higher than the year before, and in the history of the Premier League he has the lowest defeat rate of ‘Big Six’ players to have played more than 100 matches.\nThat backs up the feeling around City that he plays a big role in holding things together at the back, although those traits had been evident long before he arrived in Manchester.\n“In terms of physique, Ruben was strong for his age,” Luis Filipe Carvalho, who started working with Dias at under-nine level, tells The Athletic. “He was also really brave. That was there from the start. There was no such thing as a lost ball for him.\n“He was a young kid just starting in the game but you could see a few signs that he might become a leader one day. He was always talking on the pitch: telling people where to move, trying to assist his team-mates. He was a helper on the pitch.”\nCity were in the market for a Vincent Kompany replacement when they signed Dias in 2020 — their influential captain had left the club a year earlier and they had missed his leadership the season afterwards as Liverpool won the Premier League title.\nAdvertisement\nThat, though, was the last time that City were not named champions. Other factors also contributed to the team clicking into gear a few months after Dias arrived but he is certainly one of the reasons they have won 10 trophies since 2020.\n“He’s a leader, that’s the word that best defines him,” Bernardo Silva said at a press conference in November. “He’s a leader.”\nThere is one particular story from when Dias was at a tournament in preparation for the 2017 Under-20 World Cup, when he picked up an injury and was told to go back to his club, Benfica, to work on his recovery, but was so keen to stay that he threw down his crutch, put his foot on the ground and insisted, “But Mister, I’m fine.”\n“That was Ruben,” Emilio Peixe, who coached Dias at Benfica from the under-16s, tells The Athletic.\n“It’s not usual to find a player at that age to have such a drive, to have the hunger to train every day, in the way that Ruben did.\n“We would use him as an example when we were having one-to-ones with other players, saying: ‘Look at Ruben; he’s focused on his training and in his work, so use him as an example’.”\nCity fans will be no stranger to those descriptions, having become accustomed to seeing Dias press opponents all the way down to the corner flag, and in the way that the defence always seems that little bit more stable with him in it.\nHe was voted into City’s captaincy group after his first season in Manchester and one video from the Netflix documentary charting the club’s treble-winning campaign shows him in action, rallying the troops during the run-in.\nLOVE THIS CITY! 💙 pic.twitter.com/B94QPTa1lA\n— Manchester City (@ManCity) May 20, 2023\n“And the best thing we have is that now we’ve done it (won the Premier League in 2022-23), and they think, ‘Oh, they’re tired’, but we want to do it again — and that’s when we get big,” he says in the clip.\nAdvertisement\nThe final footage was a cut-down version of a much longer speech. “He’s a bit intense in how he works, sometimes a bit too much for me,” Bernardo continues, “but that shows his passion for the game.”\nIt has been a part of Dias’ approach for years.\n“During the pre-match talks in the dressing room, I could always tell that Ruben was like, ‘Now let me talk’,” Peixe says.\n“They would always let him speak and as captain, he would always have the last word. He would often reinforce some of the coach’s instructions for the match, so his role was almost like an assistant manager or captain.\n“That’s very rare. Most Portuguese players are too focused on their personal objectives in the match but what Ruben did, because of his communication, was bring players together as a team for the team’s objectives as opposed to just each one pulling in their own direction.”\nDias was so vocal, in fact, that he was told to tone it down once he started to break into the Benfica first team at 18, and one of the biggest things he had to work on was channelling his feedback.\n“One time, in pre-season training, when Ruben was called up to the senior team the first few times for Benfica under Rui Vitoria, at the end of the training, we went to him and said, ‘Look, you’ve got to calm it down because some of the players have been here for like 10, 20 years, and so you can’t just be shooting off with all these orders and being so vocal all the time’. But that was Ruben.”\nVitoria, speaking to The Athletic, explains how he wanted to mould Dias’ communication skills.\n“Playing at a higher level, in Benfica’s main team and with the profile of colleagues that he had, it was essential that, at the same time, he had an idea of who he was communicating with,” he says.\n“There was permanent and constant communication with all the players on the team. We often heard him, from centre-back, talking to the left-winger. That could also be harmful for him. It was essential that he focused on communicating with the players around him, namely in the defensive sector and in midfield, or, if he communicated with someone further away, that this did not distract him from his task.\nAdvertisement\n“Constantly communicating and alerting colleagues can sometimes create problems for you. This work was slow and gradual, but Ruben understood, and he, being an attentive boy, kept improving and was able to do it.”\nInterestingly, when asked what else stood out about Dias during their time together, Vitoria highlighted his work away from football.\n“What I thought at that time was that he had something which is necessary for all players today, which is an attractive commercial side,” says Vitoria, who is now in charge of Panathinaikos.\n“In fact, from a certain point onwards, he also began to worry about his image, and that was something that from the beginning, we also thought would have to happen. Not that he didn’t have an image, but today, in addition to being a player, he is also a very attractive image off the field.\n“He created this more universal dimension. Now people also know him in another way. We know Ruben as a player but we also have access to moments of him when he is in his private life and on vacation, for example, in which he clearly demonstrates another part of the player and the human being — this is an aspect that is also worth highlighting.”\nSpeaking to The Athletic for a closer look at Dias and other players’ off-pitch branding, Paulo Malva do Vale, an expert in commercial strategy, explained recently how the Portugal defender wants to essentially create a brand around the key strengths of his game.\n“Ruben felt like there was much more to his character than what he was showing on the pitch, and already that was a lot,” Malva do Vale says. “We said, ‘Let’s identify your brand space, your core values, and then create a brand architecture around you in the same way that a corporation would’.”\nThe captions that accompany his posts on X and Instagram would probably be more at home on the business-focused LinkedIn, with an almost Silicon Valley-esque motivational tone, which is a little different from most footballers’ approach but is ultimately very faithful to the real Dias.\nAdvertisement\nLast month, Dias worked with an NGO to fly four Lisbon teenagers to see City’s victory over Chelsea — they had won a competition that involved writing a paper on ‘Leadership and Sport — what can we learn from great athletes?’.\n“He always had a very positive message in the most difficult moments,” Vitoria adds, “namely when he was the first to get the ball from the goal when the team conceded, going to place it in the middle of the pitch to restart the game.\n“We were in the presence of a player who had this psychological profile, which is fundamental in high competition.”\nView this post on Instagram\nThose qualities are what sprang to mind when Bernardo discusses his friend. “He is focused, always connected to the game. Body language; everything that you expect a proper defender to have, he’s got it all.\n“Apart from that, the importance that he’s got in the dressing room is massive, because of him being so loud. We miss him.”\nBernardo was speaking in Lisbon, Portugal, at a time when Dias was out injured with a calf injury, the result of playing too many matches without a break, something which put him back on the sidelines in December.\nDias says he returned into a “death sequence” at the time, with City’s other defenders also injured, meaning he had to play through pain again until he could no longer continue. He returned in January, but picked up another problem against Paris Saint-Germain.\nBut his return is a timely boost for the latest clash with Madrid, having made that comeback against Orient on Saturday. There, he was selected as a guiding presence alongside debutant Vitor Reis, the 19-year-old Brazilian defender, a role he would not doubt relish given he has been doing the guiding and coaching even when it was he who was the newcomer.\nThere is no doubt that City’s season so far has been difficult, not just the worst of Dias’ four years at the club but quite possibly since they won the Premier League for the first time under Roberto Mancini in 2012. But if anybody can see the positives — and inspire others to do the same — it is Ruben Dias.\n(Top photo: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
