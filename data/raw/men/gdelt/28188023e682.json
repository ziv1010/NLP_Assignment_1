London boasts the national stadiums in football and rugby, the world’s most venerable venues in cricket and tennis, not to mention an Olympic Park. And Manchester? Its crowning jewel is Old Trafford, a setting of such decrepitude that it has become known less as the Theatre of Dreams than as a place where the roof leaks and where the corporate guests are served raw chicken.\nOnce, in a pre-“levelling up” age, this imbalance could be shrugged off as another byproduct of the country’s entrenched North-South divide. Today, it is an anachronism, an insult to how football’s axis of power has evolved. As it stands, there can be no more vibrant environment in the land to watch or work in the game than Manchester. It has the reigning treble winners, and they are not even the most powerful club in the city when judged by global reach. True, parts have grown “quite tired and neglected”, to use United part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s words, but in terms of prestige, this is an area paved with gold.\nAs such, Ratcliffe has found a pretext for suggesting a plan far more ambitious than simply remodelling Old Trafford, or even creating a fresh stadium from scratch. Instead, his ultimate vision is of a Wembley of the North, a gleaming beacon that can propel regeneration of the south side of Manchester and build a case for hosting FA Cup and Champions League finals. And why not? Seldom has the North West claimed such a monopoly on English football success. Between them, Liverpool, United and City have amassed 10 European Cup triumphs. London clubs? Just two.\nYou can understand why it suits Ratcliffe to make such a passionate case for this project. It has the potential to affirm him not just as an incurable sporting romantic but as a benefactor with the region’s best interests at heart. He spoke lovingly to the BBC this week about Trafford Park’s distinction as the cradle of the Industrial Revolution and its location beside the Manchester Ship Canal, “where the coal came, the cotton came”. Britain’s richest man, who has made his £30 billion fortune from chemicals, perceives a role for himself as the logical custodian of that history, unlocking a little of the prosperity of yesteryear through Manchester’s great 21st-century asset: football.\nThere is a flipside to this narrative, though. It concerns the unanswered question of how much Ratcliffe intends to fund this dream through his own bounty, and how much he expects the nation to do so. His cute phrasing is that there needs to be a “conversation” with the Government on this issue. But does there? Ratcliffe is more than capable of furnishing the requisite money himself. He is also a tax exile, who officially changed his tax residence in 2020 from Hampshire to Monaco in a move estimated to have saved him £4 billion. In these circumstances, it is galling, to put it mildly, to hear him suggest that the burden of financing United’s next chapter should be shared with the taxpayer.\nIt could, of course, be nothing more than a shrewd negotiating tactic by Ratcliffe, floating the possibility to see if the Government bites. On the surface, it looks a non-starter. After all, we have been here before with taxpayer-funded stadiums in Manchester, with the city council having paid £33 million towards a venue fit for the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Over 20 years on, City, despite acquiring the naming rights, still lease the Etihad Stadium from the council. United, by contrast, would retain full control of whatever glittering edifice Ratcliffe decided to construct. It is at this point that the justifications for him seeking public money, already flimsy in light of his Monte Carlo address, begin to break down altogether.\nStill, the substance of Ratcliffe’s masterplan is laudable. He is quite right to highlight how so much of the talk about a “Northern powerhouse” is hollow twaddle, given the Government’s recent decision to reroute money intended for the HS2 rail project into repairing London roads. He is correct to call out the absurdity of forcing supporters in the North to schlep down to Wembley and back every time their clubs reach an FA Cup semi-final. United, for all their unrivalled cachet, inhabit a section of the country that has been systematically neglected.\nRatcliffe knew all this, however, long before his 27.7 per cent United stake was finally ratified by the Premier League. As a proud United fan and former resident of Failsworth, he knew all about the historic under-investment in the North and the dilapidation into which Old Trafford had fallen. For him now to present its resurrection as an undertaking worthy of public funding is, much like the man himself, rich. If he wants to create a wonderful home for United, one worthy of the club’s heritage and of the North’s place at the centre of English football influence, then he deserves every encouragement. It is, in many ways, a noble cause. But it is one he should be financing entirely from his own pocket.\nWiegman backs Ratcliffe’s ‘Wembley of the North’ plan\nSarina Wiegman says her England side would “love” to play at a new stadium in Manchester as she spoke positively about Sir Jim Ractliffe’s pitch for building a ‘stadium of the north’.\nThe Lionesses head coach, speaking in Marbella on Thursday ahead of a friendly against Austria, said: “Wembley is so special for us, Wembley is our home, and we’ve made very great memories there. But we do travel around and I really enjoy the stadiums we play in, and it’s really good to connect with the fans up north and with the fans down south, so they have an opportunity to come and watch us and we can connect with them.\n“However, of course it would be really nice to get another great stadium in and around Manchester and we would love to play at that. At the same time, Wembley remains our special home.”\nBayern Munich and England midfielder Georgia Stanway echoed Wiegman’s comments, adding: “Wembley is our home and we’ve got a lot of good memories there. But yes, of course it would be great to have another stadium a little bit more up north.”\nOriginally from Cumbria, Stanway added: “I think my parents would appreciate that because it’s a lot less travel distance! But we’re happy to play at any stadium. We enjoy that we can really get around the country and go to different places. And for me, the two stadiums that stand out where we’ve had some great memories are Wembley and Brighton. So yes, I’m happy to make more memories at other stadiums if it’s allowed.”\nThe Lionesses face Austria in a friendly on Friday on neutral territory in southern Spain as they turn their attention towards Euro 2025, the qualifying campaign for which will get under way in April.",
