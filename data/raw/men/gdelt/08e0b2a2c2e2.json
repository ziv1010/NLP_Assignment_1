  "body_text": "Manchester United’s 2-0 win over Aston Villa had little impact on their season but significant consequences for Villa.\nThe defeat saw Villa finish sixth in the Premier League table, missing out on next season’s UEFA Champions League, a setback with major financial implications.\nThe Birmingham-based club, already grappling with financial challenges, may now need to sell players to balance their books.\nWithout Champions League football, Villa also risk losing some of their best talents while also failing to attract key transfer targets.\nOne player unlikely to remain at the club next season is Marcus Rashford.\nFollowing a reported fallout with head coach Ruben Amorim over concerns about his work ethic, Marcus Rashford was dropped from United’s matchday squad.\nAfter missing a few match days, Marcus Rashford was in need of a fresh start.\nAnd in the winter transfer window, Aston Villa saw an opportunity.\nThey approached United with a loan proposal for Rashford’s services, and with Barcelona staying away, the deal was swiftly completed.\nUnai Emery’s side secured United’s number 10 on a six-month loan, which included a £40 million option to make the deal permanent.\nThe move turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as Rashford was rediscovering his form at Villa Park before a season-ending injury halted his progress.\nRashford’s performance on loan and uncertain future\nIn 17 appearances, the 27-year-old registered four goals and six assists, respectable numbers that could have justified a permanent move.\nHowever, before Villa’s final match of the season, uncertainty remained over whether they would trigger the purchase option, especially amid links to Barcelona.\nThe one-time Champions League winners may have hoped to qualify for the tournament, securing a financial boost that would make signing Rashford viable.\nAdditionally, offering Champions League football could have convinced him to stay, presenting him with an opportunity to test himself against the best.\nHowever, Villa’s loss to Manchester United, coupled with other unfavourable league results elsewhere, shattered their hopes.\nThe defeat at Old Trafford significantly reduced the likelihood of Rashford remaining at Villa Park.\nAs the Villans came to terms with the disappointment, Rashford appears to have dropped a clear hint about his future.\nRashford’s farewell message\nOn Instagram, the forward expressed gratitude to Villa and its supporters, thanking them for his time on loan in a message suggesting a permanent switch is off the table.\n“Just a message of thanks to everyone here at Villa for what has (injury aside) been an incredible few months for me,” Rashford wrote.\n“It is a really special club and I appreciated the way Villa fans embraced me with open arms from the first minute on the pitch. Manager, team, and coaching staff have all been brilliant.\n“I know it is a huge disappointment not to have made the Champions League place, which everyone worked so hard all season for, but I know this club and team will come back stronger.”\nBarcelona links and United’s transfer plans\nRashford’s words indicate he will not remain at Villa, but he is still expected to depart Manchester United.\nReports suggest United are convinced he is heading abroad, with Barcelona emerging as the likely destination.\nSporting director Deco and new head coach Hansi Flick have openly praised Rashford, leading some to believe they are actively trying to convince him to make the switch to Spain.\nWhatever happens, all eyes will be on Rashford this summer as his next move unfolds.\nFunds from his sale could aid United in reshaping their attack, a process that has already begun with Matheus Cunha completing his move to Old Trafford this week.\nFeature image Mike Hewitt via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
