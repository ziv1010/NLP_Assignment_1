Our quality shone through and we could have scored four or five in the first half.\n‘It’s important we keep scoring goals. Two goals are perfect for us. If you look at the goal as a whole, we’re defending a long throw from our own half.\n‘Big Gabby wins the ball and I keep running with the ball. I was like a traditional number nine!’\nArsenal’s win over Burnley left the Gunners eight points clear at the top of the Premier League ahead of Bournemouth and Tottenham’s fixtures later in the weekend.\nArteta heaped praise on his team after the victory, saying: ‘The first half was exceptional, we scored two goals and gave nothing away. That was the platform.\nMore Trending\n‘We had to make a few changes and didn’t have that much control in the second half. Defending was exceptional again, we didn’t give anything.\n‘There is a reason they have lost one game in 18 months here, against Liverpool in the last second of the game.’\nOn Rice’s impressive performance, Arteta added: ‘He stepped up.
