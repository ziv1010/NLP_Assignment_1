Speaking on behalf of his sponsor, BioSteel, Dest seemed to have found a new level of clarity in the months since the World Cup. Mostly what stood out was that Dest seems happy. Something clicked in Qatar that seems to have rejuvenated him.\nAdvertisement\n“I think that was the happiest moment of my life playing football in the World Cup in Qatar,” Dest said. “That really motivated me to make sure that I’m ready for the next World Cup, the one after that and the one after that.”\nDest is known in U.S. men’s national team circles for being securely himself. He can be a bit quirky and at times aloof, but the confidence he shows on the field as an attacking right back also projects his comfort in being authentic to who he is. That’s been true for some time, even when it clashed at times with the typical Dutch way as he came up in the Ajax academy.\nThese last few years haven’t been the easiest for Dest. He moved from Ajax to his dream club, Barcelona, in 2020, but fell out of favor there after two seasons and was off to a new club again when he went on loan to AC Milan last August. On Friday he was omitted from Milan’s Champions League knockout-stage squad.\nDest said moving from Barcelona to Milan brought its own challenges, just simply from the suddenness of the loan deal coming together.\n“I had to make that decision in one day,” Dest said. “And it was just like, ‘Let’s go or not,’ and I had to move all my stuff in one day and it was a really difficult moment because it’s a life-changing moment, and you don’t know what your future is gonna be because it’s a loan. It’s with a buy option, but still, you don’t know. The first couple of weeks was kind of a little bit difficult for me to adapt because so much stuff was going on and so much stress just in a short amount of time. My family was here, my girlfriend, everybody was here, but after a couple days they left, as well. So I slept in the hotel for one month. And I was trying to find a house near the city and I was living alone in the hotel, so was just going to train and go back to the hotel and just make sure you’re ready for the next training. And it was kind of a bit difficult because you get tired of it. You don’t have your own place.”\nAdvertisement\nFinally, on Sept. 18, he left for a pair of games with the U.S. He recalls the exact date simply because it was a chance to escape.\nWhen he returned from the friendlies with the USMNT in Germany and Spain, Dest settled into his new apartment and started to enjoy his new city a bit more. It is not lost on Dest that, at the age of 22, he has lived in some pretty good cities: Amsterdam, Barcelona and Milan. Nor that he has played for some of the biggest clubs in the world. He talked about feeling “the power of this badge” when he first arrived at AC Milan. He said he has done his best to get out and enjoy the culture, and especially the food, but even with such positives, he’s had to learn to navigate the difficulty of the transience of his early professional career.\n“A lot of people, they forget that you just don’t switch a club, but you switch your whole life just in one moment,” Dest said. “Of course we have a lot of advantages in this sport as players, but it’s also mentally sometimes really hard.”\nQatar provided a bit of a respite from the upheaval for Dest. He arrived at the World Cup uncertain of what to expect. Like all but one player on the U.S. roster (DeAndre Yedlin), it was Dest’s first World Cup. But the relaxed atmosphere set up by U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter and staff suited Dest’s personality well. While some countries limited players’ access to family and friends during the tournament, players’ families were welcome at U.S. camp during the tournament. Players were also given a good amount of freedom at the hotel, Dest said.\nHe became enamored with the opportunity to meet people from many different countries and cultures. He wandered into parties at the hotel — Dest doesn’t drink, but said he simply wanted to see the atmosphere, — and enjoyed opening the door to his room’s patio and hearing people watching games at the hotel restaurants.\nAdvertisement\n“I took my PlayStation with me, I put my PlayStation in the closet, I didn’t even turn it on once,” Dest said. “Even my friends wanted to call with me and stuff. I said, ‘Bro, I’m sorry. I don’t want to call with you now. I just want to enjoy the moment, this experience. I just want to go outside, walk, talk with people.’ I think you could really see it in the field. You could really see it in the field. I think I’m the best when I have less worries.”\nDest said he became close with the security employees from Ghana that he met, “they were like my brothers there,” and that the festive atmospheres around the games helped him.\n“I was just enjoying this tournament and then every time when we stepped on the pitch, the nice weather was there, all the music of the World Cup,” Dest said. “I was smiling all day. I couldn’t stop.”\nThe relaxed atmosphere seemed to free him up on the field. Dest started all four games for the U.S., logging 309 of a possible 360 minutes, assisted Christian Pulisic’s game-winning goal against Iran and played some of his best soccer in a U.S. jersey.\n“I could feel it, I think everybody could see it (on the field), as well,” Dest said. “I wasn’t really thinking, I was just enjoying football, which is how it should be, always. In the past, obviously, sometimes it was difficult. Sometimes I felt a little bit more uncomfortable. You have bad moments in your career, obviously, and then you feel like you’re thinking too much and obviously you don’t enjoy that much. But in this World Cup I was just like, it’s nice weather, nice atmosphere, I’m enjoying life, and it was like nothing can go wrong.”\nDest said he was surprised by the drama around the U.S. men’s team since they returned from the tournament. Dest said he was unaware of the issues between winger Gio Reyna and Berhalter during the course of the tournament, learning of it only after the teams were home. He didn’t want to comment on the situation.\n“I’m just the kind of guy that minds my own business,” Dest said. “I’m just doing my own thing. And I didn’t hear a lot or too much about it. … I wasn’t really asking people too many questions and stuff because I don’t know what is true. And it’s not, to be honest, my business. It’s not my problem to be involved in.”\nAdvertisement\nDest also said he can’t control who will be the next coach of the U.S. team, but only hopes that they can carry forward the momentum from a tournament he felt was a positive one.\n“Gregg has helped us a lot,” Dest said. “Obviously he’s been here with us for four years, I’ve been here in the national team for like, three-four years and he let me make my debut, so I really appreciate it, of course. I think, so far, he helped us a lot. But if he has to stay or he has to leave, I think that’s not up to me to say. It’s not my decision. I just want to keep heading the right direction with the team and if it’s with Gregg, if that’s the best solution, then we should do it with Gregg, and if it’s another coach then we should do it with him. But I think the most important thing is the team is heading to the right direction and developing to participate in the tournaments on the highest level and really win prizes.”\nDest said he’s eager for the chance to continue to represent the U.S. on the international level. He was excited to hear about the 2024 Copa America — though he was quick to say he wished it was being played in South America and that the U.S. might have been able to experience those stadiums and fan cultures — and that he wants to be a part of the Nations League rosters to make sure the U.S. qualifies for the tournament.\nFor now, though, he is focused on trying to help Milan turn around their season, though it has been a somewhat bumpy tenure for him there. His playing time has been irregular and exclusion from the Champions League squad is obviously less than ideal.\nDest’s time at Barcelona and Milan has also coincided with difficult times at those respective power clubs. Barcelona has been fighting through major financial distress the last several years, while Milan is in a six-game winless rut and is coming off of a 3-0 loss to rival Inter in the Supercoppa, a 4-0 defeat to Lazio and a 5-2 loss to Sassuolo. They face Inter again on Sunday. Dest missed the Sassuolo loss with a muscle injury, but said he will be fit for the Inter game.\n“It’s a really difficult time at the moment,” Dest said. “I don’t know what went wrong. I feel like at the moment it’s like we’re not really playing (convincingly), especially in possession, I feel like we are not concentrated enough. Hopefully we will get that rhythm back ASAP, because training is going well, everybody is focused and stuff, but then in a game that just turns out to be not good, not good enough, for sure.”\n(Photo: David Ramos – FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images)",
