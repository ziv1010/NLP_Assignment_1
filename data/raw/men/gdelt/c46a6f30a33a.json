Is this the result to see Slegers named Arsenal's permanent new manager? It should be.\nRenée Slegers: What results has she secured for Arsenal so far?\nSlegers took over with Arsenal sitting sixth in the Women's Super League with just one win from four games. The Gunners were also bottom of their Champions League group after their loss to Bayern.\nSince taking charge, Slegers has not lost a match.\nThe results in the WSL - wins against West Ham, Brighton, Tottenham, Aston Villa and Liverpool and a draw against Manchester United - has seen them shoot up to third in the table.\nThey are only behind second-Manchester City by a point and trail leader Chelsea by seven points.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nThe Gunners have also only recorded victories in the Champions League in Slegers' reign. That included two games against Serie A leaders Juventus and the thriller against Bayern.\nThe win against the German giants secured Arsenal as group winners and was the biggest victory under Slegers, underpinning all the reasons to make her the permanent manager.\nThe results have not only been the only thing going her way, she has also won over the players and fans. In FourFourTwo's opinion Arsenal could win silverware with Slegers this season.\nPerformances have greatly improved, including the form of striker Alessia Russo. The England international insinuated the change of manager has had a hand in her efficiency in front of goal.\n“I’m feeling good. I’m enjoying my football, and I play my best when I’m happy,\" she told Sky Sports.\nAnd Steph Catley heaped praise on Slegers after the Bayern result: “Renee is our leader. She came in under difficult circumstances and really steadied the ship. She’s given a lot of individual players the confidence to play how they want and to go out and do their thing. She brings a lot of positive energy and is a really good communicator. She has been incredible.”\nArsenal have not given a timeline on when they will name Eidevall's permanent successor but if they don't do so before 1 January, Slegers will be in charge during the winter transfer window.\nThis is yet another reason she should remain at the helm. She will start to build a squad in her vision - unless the club control the signings.\nSlegers has more than proven she is able to carry out the job at the club with arugably the most fans in the WSL and therefore the most supporter pressure. She has not only brought in results but she has got the best out of the players and won over a passionate fan base.\nTo end her reign short would feel harsh, she quite literally could not have done a better job than the one she has carried out.\nEven opposition managers want her to take the job. Liverpool's Matt Beard summed it up perfectly: “I hope Renee gets the job.\n\"She’s done a fantastic job. It’s night and day from Jonas’ Arsenal to what I’m seeing. I was speaking to the staff and some of the players, you can see they’re enjoying their football again.\n“She’s done a fantastic job and I hope she gets it, I really do.”\nSarah joined the FourFourTwo team in September 2024 in a freelance role.
