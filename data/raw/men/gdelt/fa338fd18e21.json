  "body_text": "After 25 days of competition, Euro 2025 has reached its conclusion, with seven Gunners looking to get their hands on the trophy when the final whistle blows.\nIn a repeat of the 2023 World Cup final, England will take on Spain, as the reigning European champions look to get revenge on the side that pipped them to the global game’s showpiece two years ago.\nThe final takes place in Basel, kicking off at 5pm UK time, and whatever happens, we know that at least one Gunner will be lifting the silverware. Here is how our representatives have fared in Switzerland so far:\nENGLAND\nIt has been a remarkable campaign for the Lionesses, who have looked to be heading out of the tournament on numerous occasions, only to claw their way to victory.\nA 2-1 loss to France in the opening game was a blow confidence-wise, but a 4-0 success against the Netherlands put things back on track. A 6-1 triumph over Wales, when Alessia Russo and Beth Mead got on the scoresheet, saw Sarina Wiegman’s team advance to the knockout stages in second place.\nThere they faced Sweden but after Stina Blackstenius put her nation 2-0 up, England had a mountain to climb. However the introductions of Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang off the bench had a devastating impact as the former assisted the latter to make it 2-2 at the end of 90 minutes, paving the way for England to advance after a dramatic penalty shootout that saw the Swedes one successful conversion away from winning themselves.\nMichelle and Chloe were at it again in the semi-final against Italy, turning the tie on its head after their side were trailing 1-0 in the second half. But Michelle’s dramatic equaliser six minutes into injury-time forced extra-time once again, and Chloe converted a penalty on the rebound in the 118th minute to book a place in a third successive major final.\nMichelle has netted twice in just 89 minutes from three sub appearances, while Chloe has a goal and an assist from 171 minutes off the bench.\nSkipper Leah Williamson and Russo have started all five games, with Alessia netting once and providing three further assists - only Alexia Putellas has more than her at these Euros. Mead has played 245 minutes, contributing a goal and an assist, while Lotte Wubben-Moy has yet to feature as a substitute.\nSPAIN\nReaching a first-ever Euros final has been much more straightforward for Spain, who cruised through the group stage, netting 14 times on the way. Mariona Caldentey got her tournament up and running with a goal during a 6-2 rout of Belgium, after her nation had smashed neighbours Portugal 5-0 in their opener. A 3-1 success over Italy saw them top the group with maximum points.\nLa Roja then ended the hopes of hosts Switzerland in the quarter-finals by beating them 2-0, setting up a semi-final showdown with Germany. That proved their first real test of the tournament as the Germans held them to a 0-0 draw after 90 minutes, but in the 113th minute, Aitana Bonmati netted the crucial goal to produce a rematch of the 2023 World Cup final, and also the men’s Euros last summer.\nMariona has netted once during the tournament, as well as laying on two assists to her teammates across 391 minutes. She will be hoping to end a dream season by lifting another trophy, having won the Champions League as well as scooping the WSL Player of the Season, our Player of the Year award and the Champions League Goal of the Season, as well as being named in the competition’s team of the year.\nThe teams have met twice already this year in the Nations League, with England winning 1-0 in February, and Spain triumphing on home turf 2-1 in June.\nDespite their contrasting routes to the final, arguably the two best teams in women’s football right now have made it there, and it’s anyone’s guess as to whether we’ll see one or six Gunners toasting their success on Sunday evening.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
