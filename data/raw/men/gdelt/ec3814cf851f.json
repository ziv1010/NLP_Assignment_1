He was only promoted to their senior squad in the summer, but has dazzled since. Indeed, he has six goals from 21 appearances in La Liga so far this season.\nTherefore, the Spanish media is now predicting a big future for the 20-year-old. According to AS, he is being monitored by Man Utd, Arsenal and Newcastle. The latter reportedly went to watch him in a recent match against Atletico Madrid.\nIt is claimed that Celta will already struggle to keep hold of Veiga in the summer. That said, there is already an expectation that he can become their most expensive sale ever.\nCurrently, that record is held by Brais Mendez, who left for Real Sociedad for €14million last summer. Per the report, the asking price for Veiga could be around €30m (£26.5m).\nConsequently, Man Utd, Arsenal and Newcastle will be watching Veiga’s performances for the remainder of the season to determine whether or not he would be worth such a sum.\nMost of Veiga’s appearances this season have come as an attacking midfielder, but he can also feature as a central midfielder.\nIf he was to step up to the level of a club like Man Utd, Arsenal or Newcastle, he would likely have to be patient. Regular starts would be harder to come by initially.\nGabri Veiga should be patient before Premier League move\nTherefore, it might be best for Veiga to bide his time and keep enjoying his football in Vigo. There is plenty of time ahead for him to aim for a club of higher calibre, so he would be best off making a move when he would be ready to make an impact there.\nBut Veiga is starting to show his potential in Spain. In turn, big clubs will be keen to make sure they aren’t missing out on a top talent.\nHaving become a member of the Spain under-21 national team and emerging as one of La Liga’s most “fashionable” players, in AS‘ words, Veiga is making good progress with his development.\nHe will have to make any decisions about his future carefully, so as not to put that progress at risk of stagnating. But it must be an honour to see his name linked with three of the Premier League’s top clubs competing for Champions League qualification so soon into his senior career.\nCelta – who are currently 14th in the La Liga table after 22 games and are managed by former Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea City boss, Carlos Carvalhal – have Veiga under contract until 2026. They will be hoping to enjoy his services for a while longer, while maximising his value in the event of a future sale.\nREAD MORE: Arsenal, Tottenham and Man Utd eye major summer bargain for three-time Champions League winner",
