  "body_text": "Every Premier League club’s record signing as Alexander Isak replaces Florian Wirtz at Liverpool\nThe Premier League remains one of the richest leagues in the world and English clubs continue to splash the cash on new signings.\nFourteen of the 20 Premier League clubs in the 2025/26 season have broken their transfer record at some point in the last two years, including five sides that have done it this year.\nBut spending a lot of money on one player doesn’t always guarantee success as the price tag can be a heavy weight on their shoulders.\nWe’ve taken a detailed look at every Premier League club’s most expensive signing of all time. Note: we’ve included potential add-ons in the total figures.\nArsenal – Declan Rice\n- Fee: £105m\n- From: West Ham\n- Year: 2023\n- Position: Midfielder\nArsenal fought off competition from Manchester City and Bayern Munich to sign Rice from West Ham United in a £105million deal in the summer of 2023.\n“When the transfer was going through I was very nervous because of the price tag,” he admitted. “It’s natural to think about that. You’re a human being bought for £105m, it doesn’t feel very normal!\n“But that was because of what I’d done at West Ham, what they valued me at. When I signed for Arsenal I just thought, ‘I just need to be Declan Rice’, be myself, don’t be any different, everything will go smoothly.”\nThe 26-year-old has since cemented his status as one of the best midfielders in the world during two brilliant seasons at the Emirates.\nAston Villa – Moussa Diaby\n- Fee: £51.9m\n- From: Bayer Leverkusen\n- Year: 2023\n- Position: Winger\nHaving worked with Diaby at Paris Saint-Germain, Villa manager Unai Emery sanctioned a £51.9million deal for the winger in the summer of 2023.\nHe registered 10 goals and nine assists in all competitions in 2023/24 but decided to leave Villa Park after just one solitary season.\nVilla recouped most of what they spent on the France international by selling him to Saudi Pro League side Al-Ittihad for a fee in the region of £50.5million.\nBournemouth – Evanilson\n- Fee: £40.2m\n- From: Porto\n- Year: 2024\n- Position: Striker\nAfter selling Dominic Solanke to Tottenham in a deal worth up to £65million, Bournemouth were able to break their transfer record in the summer of 2024.\nThe Cherries replaced Solanke by signing Evanilson from Porto in a deal worth an initial £31.7million and another £8.5million in potential add-ons.\nDespite breaking his foot midway through his debut season, the striker still scored 12 goals from 34 appearances in all competitions in 2024/25.\nBrentford – Dango Ouattara\n- Fee: £42m\n- From: Bournemouth\n- Year: 2025\n- Position: Winger\nFollowing the club-record sale of Bryan Mbuemo to Manchester United, Brentford broke their own transfer record to sign Ouattara in a deal worth an initial £37million and £5million in add-ons.\n“We’re really happy to get Dango in,” Brentford boss Keith Andrews said. “He’s someone that we were aware and surprised could be available and, once we knew that signing him might be a possibility, we really focused on trying to get him.\n“We liked his Premier League experience, even at his young age, and he just hasn’t found the rhythm yet because of a lack of consistent game time.”\nBrighton – Georginio Rutter\n- Fee: £40m\n- From: Leeds United\n- Year: 2024\n- Position: Forward\nBrighton added Rutter to their squad in the summer of 2024 after triggering the £40million release clause in his Leeds United contract.\n“Georginio is a player who has the capabilities to get fans off their seats and really showed what he can do in English football with Leeds last season, but I have known about him since he played in Germany for Hoffenheim,” Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler said.\n“Now we have to integrate him into the team. We’re looking forward to working with him.”\nRutter registered eight goals from 32 games in his first season at Brighton, matching his career-best tally for a single campaign.\nBurnley – Lesley Ugochukwu\n- Fee: £25m\n- From: Chelsea\n- Year: 2025\n- Position: Midfielder\nFollowing Burnley’s promotion to the Premier League in 2025, Ugochukwu became their new record signing in a £25million deal from Chelsea.\nThe 21-year-old midfielder spent last season on loan at Southampton and will now hope to avoid back-to-back relegations from the Premier League.\nChelsea – Moises Caicedo\n- Fee: £115m\n- From: Brighton\n- Year: 2023\n- Position: Midfielder\nChelsea broke their own transfer record twice in the space of just six months in 2023, first by signing Enzo Fernandez in the January window and then by buying Caicedo in the summer.\nThe deal for the Ecuador international cost an initial £100million and it could reach £115million with add-ons, which would make him the most expensive signing in Premier League history.\nHe initially had a slow start to his career at Stamford Bridge, but the midfielder started to rediscover his best form in the second half of the 2023/24 season.\nThen, he went on to be voted as Chelsea’s best player in the 2024/25 campaign.\nWhat a goal from Caicedo for Chelsea!! 🤯 pic.twitter.com/QUcN7ARqjj\n— Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 19, 2024\nCrystal Palace – Christian Benteke\n- Fee: £32m\n- From: Liverpool\n- Year: 2016\n- Position: Striker\nBenteke swapped Liverpool for Crystal Palace in the summer of 2016 and enjoyed a successful debut season at Selhurst Park, netting 17 goals in all competitions.\nBut the striker failed to maintain that form, scoring just 20 goals over the following five seasons before joining MLS side DC United in 2022.\nEverton – Richarlison\n- Fee: £50m\n- From: Watford\n- Year: 2018\n- Position: Striker\nHaving worked with Richarlison at Watford, Marco Silva brought him to Everton in a club-record deal worth an initial £35million and £15million in add-ons.\nHe registered 53 goals and 15 assists in 152 appearances for the club and played an integral role in the club’s survival from the Premier League in 2021/22.\nThe Toffees then made a £10million profit by selling the Brazil international to Tottenham.\nFulham – Emile Smith Rowe\n- Fee: £34m\n- From: Arsenal\n- Year: 2024\n- Position: Midfielder\nAn Arsenal academy graduate, Smith Rowe moved across London in 2024 and joined Fulham in a deal with an initial £27million and another £7million in potential add-ons.\nThe England international had an underwhelming debut season at Craven Cottage, registering six goals and three assists in 40 appearances.\n“If he can put everything together with the quality he has, the talent he has with the physical part of the game, the physical demands and intensity the Premier League demands from him, I really believe we will see much more consistency from him,” Marco Silva said.\n“When Emile was in his best moment, he was in the best shape possible…. He’s working hard to get into the best shape he can…. Next season has to be much better from him.”\nLeeds United – Georginio Rutter\n- Fee: £36m\n- From: Hoffenheim\n- Year: 2023\n- Position: Forward\nDespite only scoring 11 goals in 64 appearances for Hoffenheim, Rutter did enough to catch Leeds’ attention and joined them in a deal worth an initial £28m.\nHe arguably wasn’t what they needed at the time to prevent relegation to the Championship, but the French forward came into his own in the second tier.\nAfter 21 goal contributions in the 2023/24 Championship season, Rutter was ready to step back up to the Premier League, even though Leeds would have to wait a year to get back themselves.\nHe duly became a second English club’s record signing when Brighton bought him for £40million, equalling the record for the most expensive mover from a Championship to a Premier League club.\nREAD MORE: The 10 most expensive Championship to Premier League transfers after agonising triple Leeds exit\nLiverpool – Alexander Isak\n- Fee: £25m\n- From: Bayer Leverkusen\n- Year: 2025\n- Position: Striker\nAfter winning the Premier League title in 2024/25, Liverpool sent a powerful signal to their rivals by making Florian Wirtz the most expensive signing in Premier League history.\nBut the midfielder lost that title a few weeks later when the Reds forked out £125million to sign Isak from Newcastle United on transfer deadline day.\nThe Sweden international arrives at Anfield with a reputation as one of the best strikers in the world, having netted 62 goals in 109 outings for Newcastle.\nAll of Alexander Isak’s goals in the Premier League ⚽️\nHow many more will he add in a Liverpool shirt? pic.twitter.com/Z65PSiCg5N\n— Premier League (@premierleague) September 2, 2025\nManchester City – Jack Grealish\n- Fee: £100m\n- From: Aston Villa\n- Year: 2021\n- Position: Attacking midfielder\nGrealish bid an emotional farewell to boyhood club Aston Villa in the summer of 2021 and joined Manchester City in a £100million deal.\nHe enjoyed a trophy-laden start to his City career, winning three successive Premier League titles, an FA Cup, the Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA World Club Cup.\nBut the England international played a bit-part role in the 2023/24 and 2024/25 campaigns and has now joined Everton on a season-long loan deal, which also includes an option to buy for £50million.\nManchester United – Romelu Lukaku\n- Fee: £90m\n- From: Everton\n- Year: 2017\n- Position: Striker\nUnited forked out a then-world record £90million package to sign Lukaku from Everton, with an initial £75million fee supplemented by add-ons.\nHe hit the ground running with 11 goals in his first 10 games for the club but was unable to maintain that form, netting 31 goals in his following 86 appearances.\nThe Belgium international fell out of favour under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and completed a £73million move to Inter Milan in the summer of 2019.\nNewcastle United – Nick Woltemade\n- Fee: £69m\n- From: Stuttgart\n- Year: 2025\n- Position: Striker\nHaving missed out on Joao Pedro, Benjamin Sesko and Hugo Ekitike in the summer of 2025, Newcastle United switched their attention to Woltemade.\nThey paid Stuttgart an initial £63million and £6million in add-ons for the striker, who has also usurped Isak as the club-record signing at St James’ Park.\n“We’re delighted to get Nick’s signing over the line so quickly,” Eddie Howe said. “He fits the profile for exactly what we have been looking to add to our attacking options.\n“He’s strong in a lot of areas – he has great technical ability and has proven himself to be a real threat in one of Europe’s top leagues – but he’s also still at an age where he has plenty of room to develop and grow here.”\nNewcastle’s club record signing 🤩\nThis is what Nick Woltemade is capable of 🙌 pic.twitter.com/YpLb4EcFQy\n— Match of the Day (@BBCMOTD) August 30, 2025\nNottingham Forest – Morgan Gibbs-White\n- Fee: £42.5m\n- From: Wolves\n- Year: 2022\n- Position: Midfielder\nAfter securing promotion to the Premier League, Forest splashed the cash in the summer of 2022 and added 21 players to their squad.\nThe most expensive of those was the signing of Gibbs-White from Wolves, with the midfielder costing an initial £25million and another £17.5million in add-ons.\nForest have since spent higher initial fees on players like Dan Ndoye and Omari Hutchinson, but the full package remains higher for Gibbs-White.\nHe has played a key role in Forest’s improvement over the last three years, helping the club finish seventh in 2024/25 and qualify for Europe.\nThe England international looked set to join Tottenham after they triggered his £60million release clause, but he has since signed a new contract at the City Ground.\nSunderland – Habib Diarra\n- Fee: £30.5m\n- From: Strasbourg\n- Year: 2025\n- Position: Midfielder\nFollowing their promotion to the Premier League at the end of the 2024/25 season, Sunderland broke their transfer record twice in a matter of weeks.\nEnzo Le Fee briefly held the mantle of their record signing after the Black Cats triggered a £19.3million clause to turn his loan deal into a permanent move.\nBut he’s been usurped by Diarra, who captained Strasbourg to a seventh-placed finish in Ligue 1 in 2024/25 and is now tasked with filling the void left by Jobe Bellingham’s departure.\nTottenham – Dominic Solanke\n- Fee: £65m\n- From: Bournemouth\n- Year: 2024\n- Position: Striker\nAfter scoring 19 Premier League goals for Bournemouth in 2023/24, Solanke joined Tottenham in a deal worth an initial £55million and another £10million in bonuses.\n“He was one I was very keen to get in,” then-Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou said. “It took a while to get over the line. I think he’ll be a great fit for us, where he’s at in his career. We identified him because he’s got the attributes we’re looking for.”\nSolanke’s debut season with Spurs ended with 16 goals from 45 games. He was a starter in the 2025 Europa League final, which Tottenham won to end their trophy drought and equally gave him the first major trophy of his career.\nWest Ham United – Lucas Paqueta\n- Fee: £51m\n- From: Lyon\n- Year: 2022\n- Position: Midfielder\nWest Ham broke their transfer record in 2022 to sign Paqueta from Lyon, paying an initial £36.5million and another £14.5million in add-ons.\nThe Brazil international helped the Hammers win the UEFA Europa Conference League in 2022/23 and his impressive performances attracted interest from Manchester City.\nBut a move collapsed and his form also dipped due to investigations into potential betting offences, which have since been cleared.\nThe Paquetá connection 💥@WestHam || #UEL pic.twitter.com/KOl7P6DEeo\n— UEFA Europa League (@EuropaLeague) November 10, 2023\nWolves – Matheus Cunha\n- Fee: £44m\n- From: Atletico Madrid\n- Year: 2023\n- Position: Forward\nWolves triggered a £44million obligation to buy Cunha in the summer of 2023, having initially signed him on loan from Atletico Madrid in January of that year.\nThe Brazil international enjoyed a promising first full season at Molineux, registering 14 goals and eight assists in the 2023/24 campaign.\nHe followed it up with 17 goals and six assists in 2024/25 before becoming Wolves’ record sale as well when Manchester United triggered his £62.5million release clause.\nREAD MORE: The 10 biggest Premier League signings in the summer 2025 transfer window",
