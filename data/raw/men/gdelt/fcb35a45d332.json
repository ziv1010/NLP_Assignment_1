But I believe in our team and we have to play at our best. When you hear the Champions League anthem, it gives something special.”\nPSV have not kept a clean sheet in their last seven Eredivisie matches, conceding three against Go Ahead Eagles over the weekend.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nHowever, manager Peter Bosz said he has no plans to adapt his side’s aggressive style which has seen them score in every home game this season.\n‘I already indicated last year that defending starts with attacking,” he said when quizzed as to whether he will be more conservative against the Gunners.\n‘We immediately put pressure on the ball, which allowed us to win it back quickly and often did not have to defend at all. Football is a complex sport. You cannot point to one single aspect.\n‘It is a combination of many factors that have to come together well. It is often small details that prevent us from winning matches. We are working intensively to improve those details and I am responsible for that.’\nArsenal’s lack of firepower, meanwhile, may offer PSV hope of a rare clean sheet with the Gunners lacking a host of key players including the likes of Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz.\nArteta’s men failed to score in each of their last two games and have fallen 13 points off the pace in the race for the Premier League title.\nAsked how he will instil belief in his players following a difficult fortnight, Artea said:’ Well, try to explain how we’re going to do it and why we do things, and they try to deliver that in the best possible way.\n‘In the last two results it’s been very different, in terms of performance as well, not getting the right result that we want, but we’ve certainly been better, especially in the last game with the opposition.\nMore Trending\n‘And the fact we still have gears, even with the players that we have, some of them have gears to take us to a different level.\n‘When it comes to that stage, it’s about lifting the level and the standards, every individual has to be at their best.\n‘When we do that, with the team that we have and the connection we have between us, we are a really strong team.’\nMORE: The grim reason Manchester United fans have been told to wear black against Arsenal\nMORE: Arsenal make Champions League history with PSV annihilation\nMORE: ‘What is he waiting for?’ – Arsenal target told to reject free transfer in summer",
