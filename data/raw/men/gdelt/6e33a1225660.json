Victories and defeats are temporary; they don’t define a person’s entire worth or happiness. Values such as family, health, personal integrity, humility, and compassion ultimately matter more than results on the scoreboard.\nComing from someone who has won almost everything in football, the statement also reflects maturity and balance. Messi acknowledges that success is meaningful, but it should not come at the cost of mental well-being, relationships, or basic humanity. Losses can teach resilience, and wins should not breed arrogance—both are moments, not life’s ultimate purpose.\nIn essence, the quote reminds us that sport is important, but life itself is bigger. Football can bring joy, lessons, and inspiration, but who you are off the field matters more than what you achieve on it.\nAll you need to know about Messi\nWidely regarded as one of the greatest footballers in history, Lionel Messi has rewritten the sport’s record books. He joined FC Barcelona at just 13, with the club supporting his growth hormone treatment, and went on to define an era.\nMessi is Barcelona’s all-time top scorer and the foreign player with the most appearances for the club. He is the highest scorer in league history, the league’s all-time leading assist provider, and the world’s top scorer in a calendar year with 91 goals in 2012. He set the single-season league scoring record with 50 goals in the 2011–12 season, scored Barcelona’s 5,000th and 6,000th league goals, and netted the club’s 500th goal in the European Cup/Champions League.\nHe became the first player to score 100 international competition goals for a single club and the only player to score more than 30 official goals in 12 consecutive seasons between 2008 and 2020. Messi also holds the record for consecutive league matches with a goal—21 games and 33 goals in the 2012–13 season. He has finished as a league’s top scorer seven times, won three consecutive Golden Boots, and claimed four straight Ballon d’Or awards from 2009 to 2012. He is also the Champions League’s top non-European scorer and the competition’s all-time leading assist provider.\nNicknamed La Pulga, Messi scored one of football’s most iconic goals against Getafe in 2007 and found the net in two Champions League finals in 2009 and 2011. Off the pitch, he founded the Leo Messi Foundation in 2007 to support underprivileged children in Argentina.",
