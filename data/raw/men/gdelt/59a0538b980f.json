The winner of the Asian tournament collects $3.8 million.\nAuckland City tackle Victorian NPL giant killers Heidelberg in the other Australian Cup semi in Melbourne on Saturday night.-\nAuckland are ineligible to compete in Asia, as New Zealand is a member of the Oceana confederation.\nThat means a win over Avondale could be enough for the Jets to progress.\nAvondale's three wins in this Australia Cup campaign have been against NPL opposition. They beat West Australia club Stirling Macedonia (5-1), Apia Leichhardt (3-1) and Brisbane City (6-2).\nAfter beating Brisbane City last Wednesday, they knocked over Green Gully to win the Victorian NPL by four points from Heidelberg.\n\"They have been doing very well in their competition,\" Grozos said. \"They deserve to be there, and I'm sure it will be a fair match-up.\"\nAsked if the Jets had done much analysis of Avondale, Grozos said: \"The focus has been on ourselves and what we can do.\"\nAvondale were formed in 1984 and has only been in the Victorian NPL for 10 years.\nFormer A-League players Massimo Murdocca, Jonatan Germano and Kaine Sheppard, who had two seasons at the Jets, have previously called Avenger Park home.\nThe current crop of players are semi-professional, and most work day jobs.\n\"Our midfield is second to none. I think we have the best midfield in Australia,\" said captain and construction site foreman Ayden Brice after the win over Brisbane City in the quarter-final.\"\nCoach Zoran Markovski has made no secret of his desire to win the Cup.\n\"If you are there just to make up the numbers, you may as well not be there.\" he said.\n\"We are in there to win it. I'm confident we can go all the way.\"\nAvondale Striker Manyluak Aguek scored a hat-trick in the quarter-final and is the leading striker in the Cup with six goals.\n\"They have obviously done really well,\" said Newcastle keeper Delianov, who joined the Jets this season and has recorded consecutive clean sheets.\n\"I'm a Melbourne boy and I have never played out there [at Avondale]. I grew up in the northern suburbs. They weren't in our competition.\n\"Them being an NPL club doesn't change our approach.\n\"It's just football. The ball is still round. It is a different challenge. We will definitely be ready for it.\"\nJets coach Mark Milligan has tinkered with the team throughout the Cup run.\nHe will be without striker Ben Gibson, who is in camp with the Australian under-23s. Lachie Bayliss was replaced at half-time of the 3-0 win over Macarthur with a leg injury.\nLachie Rose is likely to play at the point, with Grozos starting at the base of midfield.\nTom Aquilina made a successful return from injury against the Bulls and is a strong chance to come in for Christian Bracco, who has been used as a makeshift right back.\nThe Jets have been impressive in wins over Adelaide (2-1), Cooks Hill (5-0) and Macarthur, but Delianov ruled out any hint of complacency.\n\"Mark [Miligan] is always stressing the importance of never being happy,\" Delianov said. \"We take the wins, we enjoy the wins, but we know what the end goal looks like.\n\"It is important to progress in this competition. Playing in Asia next year would be massive for us. That is definitely the goal.\"\nJets (possible): Delianov; Daniel Wilmering, Aleks Susnjar, Max Cooper, Tom Aquilina; Grozos, Alex Badolato, Max Burgess; Kota Mizunuma, Rose, Xavier Bertoncello",
