  "body_text": "Bahrain champions Al Khaldiya punched their tickets last night to the round of 16 of the AFC Champions League (ACL) Two following a resounding 4-0 victory over Altyn Asyr of Turkmenistan.\nAlgerian professional Oussama Bellatreche fired in a second-half hat-trick after Bahrain national team star Mahdi Abduljabbar supplied the game’s opening goal in a one-sided contest at the National Stadium in Riffa.\nThe result gave Khaldiya 12 points to end their campaign in Group B of the ACL Two’s preliminary round. They finished second on the table behind Al Taawoun FC of Saudi Arabia, who also advanced to the knockouts.\nTaawoun were 1-0 winners over Air Force SC of Iraq in yesterday’s other divisional clash, played at Al Madina International Stadium in Baghdad. The Saudis thus marched through as Group B winners with 15 points, while Air Force finished third on nine. Altyn Asyr placed last with zero points from six losses.\n“This was a historical win and qualification for Bahrain and for Al Khaldiya Club,” head coach Ali Ashoor told the GDN following the game.\n“We gained a lot of experience in this group stage, played big historical teams – some of whom have a market value that is maybe 30 times more than ours – and we learned a lot against them.\n“We gained good experience and we will try our best to take it to the next round, where we will face other big and historical teams.\n“I hope that my players, time by time and match by match, continue to grow together so we can reach our target, which is to represent Bahrain in the best way and play games like these today.”\nIn last night’s clash, Khaldiya took the lead in the 10th minute following some brilliant approach play. Bahrain international superstar Komail Al Aswad found teammate Dhurgham Ismail on the left flank, and the Iraqi delivered a fine low pass to a charging Abduljabbar in the face of goal. Abduljabbar needed only to guide the ball into the net with a sliding effort, giving the hosts the early advantage.\nLater in the 27th minute, veteran defender Sayed Dhiya Saeed had a low, left-footed effort from outside the box go on target but the shot was punched away by Altyn Asyr goalkeeper Batyr Babayew. Seydina Laye Dabo also had a chance late in the half off a pass from Bellatreche, but his attempt went just inches wide of the right post.\nAfter the break, it was Bellatreche’s time to shine. He doubled Khaldiya’s lead just two minutes into the re-start with a header from close range, assisted by an under-hit shot by Dabo following a free-kick from distance by Al Aswad.\nBellatreche then made it 3-0 with his second goal in the 54th minute, scoring with another header, this time while unmarked off a fine cross supplied by Ismail, who also came close to finding the net in the 80th minute.\nBellatreche then sealed the big win and his hat-trick a minute from full time off an assist from Brazilian teammate Igor Torres Da Silva. Da Silva masterfully battled through the defence of up to four Altyn Asyr players to perfectly set up the goal-scoring opportunity for Bellatreche, who sent the ball home with one touch.\nThe ACL Two is the second-tier club competition of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). It is below the AFC Champions League Elite and above the AFC Challenge League.\nThe round of 16 knockouts will be played in 2025. This stage, along with the quarter-finals and semi-finals, will be played in two legs. That will set up a thrilling final, which will be a single match on May 17 next year.\npatrick@gdnmedia.bh\nTop stories for today:\nLast-minute push to save iconic National Day lights installation\nTop club displays sign of the times\nTamkeen support for sports sector urged",
