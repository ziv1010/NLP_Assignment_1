Much less known by his full name, Ahmed Hossam Hussein Abdelhamid, the Egypt striker was the star during the 2001 edition in Ethiopia.\nThe Young Pharaohs finished as bronze medalists but Mido made a huge impression with the Zamalek prodigy attracting scouts from several European clubs.\nBelgian side Gent won the race and he flourished at the club before joining Dutch giants Ajax to continue his development.\nIt was at Ajax that he realised his biggest dreams of his career, notably winning the league, the FA Cup and the Dutch Super Cup in 2002.\nMido went on to play for top clubs in Spain, France, England and Italy and won African Cup of Nations with the Pharaohs on home soil in 2006 before retiring.\nYaya Toure\nIn 2003 in Burkina Faso, a certain Yaya Toure was discovered. Unhappy finalist of this edition won by Egypt, the former student of ASEC Academy impressed and won the Best Player of the tournament.\nYaya's ratings soared at Belgian side Beveren as many clubs wanted his services, but he made a surprise move to Ukrainian outfit Metalurg Donetsk, where he spent two seasons before joining Greek heavyweights Olympiakos.\nIn Greece, he won the League and FA Cup in his debut season before being spotted by French side Monaco from where he secured a big career move to Barcelona.\nThree successful seasons with the Spanish giants saw him claim all the trophies in his path in 2009 by winning the Champions League, Spanish league, Spanish Cup, Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and the Club World Cup.\nAfter winning everything with Barelona, Toure joined Manchester City in England, winning the league thrice, the FA Cup and two League Cups.\nMeanwhile, with the national team of whom he became captain, he won the TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations in 2015 with the Elephants, the 2nd continental title for Côte d'Ivoire after their 1992 success.\nA career rich in trophies which allowed the son of Bouake to win the title of CAF Player of the Year four times, a record he shares with Samuel Eto'o.\nJohn Obi Mikel\nNigeria dominated and won the 2005 edition in Benin and in the ranks of the Flying Eagles were well-known names like Taye Taiwo, Victor Nsofor, Isaac Promise and John Obi Mikel.\nThe latter, who won the Player of the Tournament, moved to Lyn Oslo and Chelsea signed him from the Norwegian side for then transfer record of £23million\nMikel went on to play 11 seasons for the Blues, winning two English League titles, six domestic cups, but above all a Champions League in 2012 and the Europa League the following season.\nHe was vice captain of the Super Eagles when they won the TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa in 2013.\nAndre Ayew\nThere are no TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations winners medals yet but Ghana's Andre Ayew tasted success at the youth level with the Holy Grail in 2009.\nHe captained the Black Satellites to continental and World Cup glory 14-years ago.\nGhana edged Cameroon in the 2009 U-20 AFCON final in Rwanda and the Marseillais shone during the competition, including a goal in the semi-finals.\nA key element of the team, the son of the legendary Abedi Pelé displayed his technique and proves that he has inherited the qualities of his father.\nHelifted the trophy with his team-mates before returning to Marseille where he will finally gain confidence and consistency after successive loans to Lorient and Arles-Avignon.\nHe will then experience the English Premier League, Turkey and the Qatari championship, before returning to England this winter to rejoin Steve Cooper at Nottingham Forest.\nTo his credit, Ayew won two League Cups with Marseille and a Qatar Cup with Al-Sadd SC but also two AFCON finals and three participations at the World Cup with the Black Stars.\nMohammed Salah\nIn South Africa in 2011, the young Mohamed Salah winger of Arab Contractors was far from imagining the turn that his career would take after just a decent showing at the U20 AFCON.\nHe only scored one goal in the group stage against Lesotho and Egypt only finished third but scouts had seen the potential of the 17-year-old who was then the youngest player in the Egypt top-flight.\nWith interest from African giants Al Ahly, Salah finally landed in Switzerland, at FC Basel who won the race and he spurred the club to successes particularly in 2013, when he was named the Best Player of the Swiss Championship.\nBasel won the League title in 2013 and 2014 and Chelsea snapped him up with a mixed first season in England before moving to Italy with Fiorentina and AS Roma. Two seasons later, he returned to England to play for Liverpool with a record African transfer fee.\nSalah did not disappoint as he helped them to win the Premier League title in 2020 - the first time in many years - after helping them to clinch the title Champions League a year earlier.\nHe was twice crowned CAF Footballer of the Year in 2018 and 2019.\nOthers\nSince then, many players from the continent have followed in their footsteps like Charles Kaboré (Burkina Faso), Benjamin Moukandjo (Cameroon) or Ahmed Hegazy (Egypt).\nIn Mali, Amadou Haïdara, very prominent in 2017 with the Aiglons and now with Leipzig, or his compatriot Sekou Koita, player of Red Bull Salzburg have taken over from the idol Seydou Keita, Best Player of the U-20 AFCON in 1999.\nCrowned Best Player of the tournament at only 16 years old, the Senegalese Moussa N'Diaye joined FC Barcelona before moving to record Belgian champions Anderlecht.\nHis compatriots Krépin Diatta and Ibrahima Niane, who went through this youth competition, are now respectively in Monaco and Angers.\nGhanaian Abdul Fatawu, crowned Best Player of the 2021 edition in Ghana's victory over the surprise Ugandan, is having an encouraging start with Sporting Portugal.\nFor his part, the Zambian Patson Daka, crowned in 2017 with the Chipolopolo, is now the delight of Leicester supporters in the Premier League.",
