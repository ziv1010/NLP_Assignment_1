That sum made Dragusin the most expensive Romanian in football history.\nYet despite the outlay and Spurs’ various struggles with form and fitness in defence, Dragusin made just four league starts.\nIt’s far too early for Tottenham fans to panic and there is no suggestion Postecoglou and technical director Johan Lange believe they made a mistake with the move.\nBut according to former Romania striker, Ionel Ganea, Dragusin would have been better served snubbing Spurs and joining Bayern.\nIronically enough, Bayern did sign a centre-back in the winter window – Tottenham’s Eric Dier.\nDespite regularly failing to make Postecoglou’s matchday squads in the first half of the season, Dier surpassed all expectations and became a regular starter in Bavaria.\n“My opinion is that he chose the wrong team,” Ganea said of Dragusin’s decision to join Spurs.\n“Bayern Munich was much more suitable for him.”\nREAD MORE: Tottenham striker targets: EVERY single option linked with a summer 2024 switch\nRomanian concerns won’t bother Postecoglou\nGanea bagged 19 goals in 45 appearances for his country and scored the goal that dumped England out of Euro 2000 in the group stage.\nThe Romania-based concerns regarding Dragusin likely relate to the club’s ambitions ahead of Euro 2024.\nRomania were drawn in Group E where they’ll square off against Belgium, Ukraine and Slovakia.\nBelgium will be expected to top the group, though second place does appear to be up for grabs. What’s more, a handful of the highest ranking third-placed teams will qualify for the knockout stages.\nDragusin is expected to be a starter at the heart of Romania’s defence, though given his lack of minutes for Tottenham, he’ll enter the tournament undercooked.\nOf course, that will be of little concern to Postecoglou whose sole focus is on Spurs and bringing silverware to the club.\nDON’T MISS: Tottenham lock on to £25.5m centre-back who humbled Harry Kane, as defensive exodus collects new names",
