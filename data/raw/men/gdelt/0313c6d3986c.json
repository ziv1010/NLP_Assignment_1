The 27-year-old has been in exceptional form for Brentford in the Premier League this season, recording eight clean sheets in 23 appearances and making more saves (100) than any other goalkeeper. Brentford desperately want to keep Raya but he has less than 18 months left on his deal and is attracting interest from other clubs, among them Tottenham Hotspur.\nAdvertisement\nIn an exclusive interview with The Athletic, Raya talks about his ambition of winning trophies, overcoming concerns about his size, dealing with criticism as a goalkeeper, how playing footgolf improved his kicking accuracy, and his experiences with Spain at the World Cup.\nBut before we get onto any of that, he breaks down the situation with Brentford.\n“I turned down two contracts, one last year and one this January,” Raya tells The Athletic. “They weren’t the offers we were looking for. I can only say that.\n“I want to focus on playing games and not think too much about my future. I have a contract here, so I’m willing to finish that, but you never know what’s going to happen in the summer. Maybe the club wants to sell, maybe not. Maybe I want to stay. I want to focus on football and see what happens.”\nBrentford offered Raya a deal that would make him one of the best-paid players in their history. However, before their 1-1 draw with Arsenal earlier this month, Thomas Frank admitted it will be “difficult” to keep hold of him this summer.\nFrank believes he is “one of the best keepers in the league” and said that he is “worth at least £40million” before adding “if he had three years (left) on his contract, he would be £70m”. Brentford’s record sale is Ollie Watkins’ £28m ($33.5m) move to Aston Villa in September 2020, so Raya could smash that figure.\n“The club will decide the price and if a club wants to pay money, that will be it,” he says. “I’m not worried about that. I’m not in charge of that.”\nThe Athletic meets Raya in an old locker room at Brentford’s training ground a couple of days after Real Madrid thumped Liverpool 5-2 in the first leg of their last-16 Champions League tie. He was born in Barcelona but, with a Real Madrid-supporting father, Raya grew up idolising Iker Casillas.\nAdvertisement\nRaya has achieved his dream of playing in the Premier League — he even has the date of his debut tattooed on the back of his neck — but when he watches Champions League matches, is there a part of him which feels ready to make the step up?\n“I have big ambitions,” says the goalkeeper, who has been capped twice by Spain and was an unused member of their squad at the World Cup. “I want to play in Europe and I want to fight to win a title. I want to fight to win a European title. I trust myself to be able to play in those types of games.”\nAlisson and Thibaut Courtois both made high-profile mistakes when Real Madrid faced Liverpool at Anfield last week. Unfortunately for goalkeepers, every decision they make is overanalysed.\nRaya experienced this when he was caught out of position during the 2020 Championship play-off final and Joe Bryan scored a 35-yard free kick to give Fulham the lead in the 105th minute. Brentford never recovered and lost 2-1. The blame was unfairly placed on Raya’s shoulders.\nIs this the goal that sends #FFC back to the Premier League?\nJoe Bryan catches Raya out from 35 yards! pic.twitter.com/YIFHCG8kxC\n— Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) August 4, 2020\n“You have to deal with it,” he says. “You have to be tough-minded and, in a good way, not care about it but always learn from it. Think about what you did wrong afterwards and not in the moment. Otherwise, your confidence will go low. You have to focus on the next action.\n“Mistakes are always going to happen and there’s loads of them during a game. But being a goalkeeper, normally, a mistake will cost you a goal. You don’t have to change your way of playing or thinking because of one mistake.”\nCourtois slipped up trying to play out from the back under pressure and Raya was guilty of something similar when Brentford lost to Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in February 2022. He attempted to play a clever pass between the lines for Mathias Jensen but Raheem Sterling intercepted it and Kevin De Bruyne tucked the ball away. It was Raya’s first appearance in the league for four months following a knee injury, so rustiness was to be expected.\nAdvertisement\n“I’m very critical of myself. There’s always something that I can do better,” he says. “I know when I have played a good game and when I have played a bad or an average game. I try not to focus too much on what people and the press say. I care what I think and what the gaffer thinks. If he thinks there are things I can do better, we will speak about it and go from there.”\nRaya’s distribution is immaculate most of the time, though. After Brentford drew 3-3 with Liverpool in September 2021, Jurgen Klopp described him as a “No 10” due to his impressive passing range. He was heavily involved in Ivan Toney’s first goal when Brentford memorably beat champions City at the Etihad in November.\nWhat a stellar start for the Bees!!\nIvan Toney puts Brentford 1-0 up against Man City away from home!! 💫#EPL pic.twitter.com/MkN1KcDyw1\n— Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) November 12, 2022\nRaya spent hours practising kicking during his time in Blackburn’s academy. “I was staying in digs and on the weekends most of the other players who lived there would go home,” says the Spain international. “The foreign lads would stay behind, go to this massive indoor dome and play head tennis or competitions with long balls.\n“I used to play footgolf (a sport played similarly to golf but players kick a football into a bigger cup instead) once a week with the academy goalkeeping coach Steven Drench — he had a hell of a strike and side volley. I worked on my left and right foot with him as well. I try to take things from everyone I work with and I learned a lot from that to get more accurate.”\nDuring his childhood, Raya played futsal on a concrete pitch with his friends at the weekend. He wanted a rest from going in goal during school lunch breaks and this was his time to shine.\nRaya credits futsal with helping him become comfortable with the ball at his feet but he was quickly told to stop dribbling past strikers. Yet he could not resist pulling off this clever piece of skill — which every winger in the world would be proud of — when Brentford drew with league leaders Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium earlier this month.\nSee ya!\n😎 @daviidraya1 pic.twitter.com/pD5qmHynjE\n— Brentford FC (@BrentfordFC) February 12, 2023\n“It comes from Bryan Mbeumo giving me a bad pass,” chuckles Raya. “I saw Eddie Nketiah running very fast out of the corner of my eye. He was sliding, so if I strike the ball first time, there was a chance of him blocking it, deflecting it to another Arsenal player, and then they score.\nAdvertisement\n“I decided to flick it back on my heel and go in the opposite direction. That’s just the confidence I have with different types of things I can do to get away from a situation and then make a better pass or clearance.”\nRaya is a member of Brentford’s leadership group along with Ivan Toney, Pontus Jansson and Christian Norgaard. Jansson, the club’s captain, has been struggling with a hamstring injury since October, so Raya has taken on more responsibility in ensuring standards do not slip in training.\nYou can see an unusual example of Raya’s leadership style during matches whenever there is a break in play. He will often run over to the touchline and have an in-depth conversation with Manu Sotelo, Brentford’s goalkeeping coach.\nRaya and Mee receiving instructions during a break in play pic.twitter.com/kDbwOKr8IR\n— Jay Harris (@jaydmharris) October 8, 2022\n“I normally do it when we have a set piece in the other half,” says Raya. “I know we take our time to take set pieces. Keepers see football from behind, so I might see stuff that from the sideline they don’t see, even from the top. Or even the other way around — if they see something that can help me or the team.\n“Maybe I have to be higher because (the opponents) are playing balls in behind. Maybe it’s about our defensive set pieces. In the second half, when the substitutes are coming on, I need to know what the new player’s role is going to be. I need to know how to organise the defence and the attack.”\nThis might sound like common sense but it’s important to point out that Frank regularly switches Brentford’s formation during games. When they went 1-0 down against Crystal Palace, he changed their system from a 4-3-3 to a 3-4-3 system. Mbeumo moved from upfront to right wing-back and Vitaly Janelt, who normally plays in central midfield, came off the bench to play at left centre-back.\nBy staying in regular communication with the coaching staff, Raya keeps his team organised. It must be working as they are ninth in the Premier League table and unbeaten in 11 matches.\nRaya grew up in Palleja, a 20-minute drive northwest of Barcelona. At the age of 10, he joined Cornella’s academy and immediately impressed their goalkeeping coach Cesar Lopez.\nAdvertisement\nRaya would finish school at 5pm, get picked up by his father and grandfather for training, which started at 6pm and would not finish until 10pm. Lopez would challenge Raya by making him train with older age groups.\nAndres Manzano is Cornella’s general director and he previously looked after their academy. He told The Athletic last May that he always knew Raya would achieve “something special” in his career because even at such a young age, he was “really disciplined” and a “leader”. Lopez and Manzano loved Raya, but he encountered scepticism when he went on trial with Blackburn at 16 due to his size.\n“When I came to England, I was smaller than I am now,” says the Brentford keeper, whose first taste of senior football came during a loan spell with Southport in the Conference Premier in the 2014-15 season.\n“I was 180cm (tall) and now, I am 186cm. We are talking about 11 years ago when the traditional goalkeeper was maybe over 6ft 3in. I was under 6ft, so it was a concern.\n“People concerned about my (dealing with) crossing can see the stats. My cross-claiming is really good because I can see where the ball is going to land. That’s why my height is not that important.”\nThe chart below shows Raya is the second-shortest goalkeeper in the top flight (who have made at least 10 appearances this season) after Everton’s England No 1 Jordan Pickford.\nBefore the latest round of fixtures, Raya had faced more crosses (481) than any other keeper in the top flight in 2022-23. He claimed 37 of those, which was second behind Emiliano Martinez (38), and punched away six.\nIt is difficult to draw too many conclusions because a lot of those crosses might have been nowhere near him, whereas rival goalkeepers might have had a higher proportion of crosses played closer to them. Yet the numbers indicate Raya is confident dealing with lofted balls and has therefore made a mockery of those who doubted him.\nAdvertisement\nRaya broke into Spain’s squad under their former head coach Luis Enrique and made his debut for them in a friendly against Albania in March 2022. He went to the World Cup in Qatar but Unai Simon was the first-choice goalkeeper and played in all of Spain’s matches as they were knocked out on penalties by Morocco in the last 16.\nDespite getting a headache from the noise those jubilant Morocco fans generated at the Education City Stadium, Raya still describes his first tournament as an “incredible” experience and a “dream come true”.\n“There’s nothing bigger in sports than the World Cup,” he says. “So it was very pleasing for me and my family, especially because my journey has not been easy. I haven’t just been playing at the highest level since I was young. I had to work to get where I am now.”\nDespite still being relatively new to Spain’s setup, Raya quickly forged strong relationships with Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta, Real Madrid duo Dani Carvajal and Marco Asensio, and Barcelona full-back Jordi Alba. Spain were based at Qatar University and the group would play table tennis, pool and darts in their spare time. Raya struggled to sleep during the tournament because he was so excited and would watch all of the other matches in a special cinema room.\nRaya got both his caps under Luis Enrique but the former Barcelona coach was sacked after the tournament and Luis de la Fuente is now the man in charge. Spain have two qualifying matches for the 2024 European Championship against Norway and Scotland next month, and there is no guarantee Raya will be involved.\n“In a club team, you might have two or three bad games but the gaffer trusts you and will give you one more chance to get back into form,” says Raya.\n“The national team is completely different: if you’re not in form, the coach will not pick you. With the new coach, De la Fuente, I have to try to do my best for him to pick me. You always have to prove yourself in that aspect.”\nOur conversation ends with Raya acting coy about his chances of going to the Euros and the next World Cup. After all, it’s resolving his immediate future that is the biggest priority.\n(Other contributor: Thom Harris)\n(Top photo: Brentford FC)",
