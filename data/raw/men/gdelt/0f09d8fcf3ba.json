  "body_text": "Star Brazilian footballer Neymar Jr. will not come to India next month to take part in his Saudi Professional League side Al Hilal’s AFC Champions League group stage match against Mumbai City FC. Indian Super League side Mumbai City FC will host Al Hilal at Dr. DY Patil Sports Academy in Navi Mumbai on November 6, but Neymar will not play in that match after suffering an injury during Brazil’s South American World Cup qualifier match against Uruguay on Tuesday (Wednesday IST).\nNeymar, who is Brazil's all-time leading goal scorer in international football, was stretchered off in tears just before halftime after getting injured during the Brazil-Uruguay match in Montevideo, which his side lost by a margin of 0-2. According to an official update by the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF), the 31-year-old footballer who joined Al Hilal from French Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain in the summer transfer window this year has a torn ligament and meniscus in his left knee and will have to undergo surgery.\nNeymar will undergo surgery for the injuries at a \"yet-to-be-determined date,\" the CBF said, after a series of medical exams on the player in Sao Paulo.\n\"Brazilian and world football need Neymar healthy and recovered, because football is happier when he's on the pitch,\" CBF president Ednaldo Rodrigues said in a statement.\nThe CBF said its medical department and Al Hilal are in \"constant contact\" and \"aligned\" on helping the striker recover.\nNeymar twisted his knee in a collision with Uruguayan midfielder Nicolas de la Cruz in stoppage time near the end of the first half. Carried off on a stretcher, he left the stadium on crutches and wearing a leg brace after the match.\nIt is the latest in a string of injuries for the star, who underwent surgery in March for an ankle problem that sidelined him for six months.\nThe CBF said Neymar's injury was to his anterior cruciate ligament, one of the worst of all. Surgery to repair the condition often takes players out of action for months.",
