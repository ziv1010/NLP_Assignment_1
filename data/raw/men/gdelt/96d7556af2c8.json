All you need to know about the UEFA Nations League final between Portugal and Spain.\nPortugal vs Spain at a glance\nWhen: Sunday 8 June (21:00 CET kick-off)\nWhere: Munich Football Arena, Munich\nWhat: UEFA Nations League final\nHow to follow: Build-up and live coverage here\nWhat do you need to know?\nWinners of the inaugural Nations League title in 2019, Portugal have the opportunity to lead the way again as they – like Spain – bid to become the first two-time winners of the competition. Roberto Martínez's side remain in Munich for the final after ousting hosts Germany with a turnaround victory, Cristiano Ronaldo rolling in the winner after Francisco Conceição's stunning leveller. Facing Spain will bring back fond memories for the 40-year-old Ronaldo, who struck a hat-trick during a memorable encounter between the sides at the World Cup in 2018 – a haul that, if repeated on Sunday, would take him past Viktor Gyökeres as the top scorer of this Nations League campaign.\nHolders Spain have the opportunity to earn major international honours for a third consecutive year, Luis de la Fuente having already guided them to Nations League glory in 2023 and a European Championship in 2024. It was not hard to see why La Roja have proved so unstoppable as they roared into a 4-0 lead against France, but some vulnerability was exposed as Les Bleus fought back and only narrowly lost 5-4. Resolving some of those issues ahead of Sunday could be pivotal, Mikel Merino warning of Portugal's threat: \"They're another team of incredible quality – just look at the starting XI and the squad.\"\nPossible line-ups\nPortugal: Diogo Costa; Nélson Semedo, Rúben Dias, Gonçalo Inácio, Nuno Mendes; Vitinha, Bruno Fernandes, João Neves; Bernardo Silva, Ronaldo, Pedro Neto\n- Roberto Martínez has kept faith with his usual core of players for these finals in Germany and you would expect him to stick with that principle of continuity after defeating Germany, though Vitinha is likely to reclaim his place in the starting XI after his substitute appearance.\nCarlos Machado, Portugal reporter\nSpain: Unai Simón; Pedro Porro, Le Normand, Huijsen, Cucurella; Pedri, Fabian Ruíz: Yamal, Merino, Williams; Oyarzabal\n- After the semi-final, De la Fuente said: \"There's not a lot I have to change for Sunday\". He was talking about the way his team plays but that could easily apply to the starting line-up too. There are some questions though: does Champions League winner Fabian Ruíz return to the starting line-up? I would think so. Pedri moving to pivot worked well against France, so why not repeat?\nGraham Hunter, Spain reporter\nReporters' views\nCarlos Machado, Portugal reporter\nIt's not just about reaching the final. It's the way they did it. It will be a confident Portugal team that steps out on the pitch again in Munich. Ronaldo provided the crescendo moment while Martínez's substitutes managed to swing the momentum in the second half, giving plenty of reason to believe that this Portugal team can take the game to the reigning champions or respond to an early setback.\nGraham Hunter, Spain reporter\nBefore the semi-final I called this Spain's favourite competition, and I think I was proved correct. OK, La Roja conceded far too many goals again – which does give Portugal some clues as to where, and how, the European champions are vulnerable. But Spain also look like they can score for fun, they have a powerful bench, and obvious desire to retain this trophy. Whoever you speak to, players or staff, will emphasise the old Luis Aragonés saying: \"Ganar y ganar y ganar!\" (Just win, win then win again!). That spirit, allied to their talent, can pull them through in Munich.\nView from the camps\nRoberto Martínez, Portugal coach: \"When you used to play against Spain, you had to control the way they keep the ball, the way they control the games with the ball possession, the way they can drag you out of position. They do that, because it's in their DNA. It's how the players are developed in the early years. But now, they added pace and verticality with Nico Williams and Lamine Yamal. So you're talking about probably one of the best teams in the world in terms of using that speed and using that transition, with the normal aspect of a team that know how to play, how to keep the ball, how to defend with the ball, and that makes them a very complete team.\"\nCristiano Ronaldo, Portugal captain: \"We're all feeling upbeat, confident, playing an amazing team, maybe the best in the world, but we're confident after what we did in our last tie. I hope we can rise to the occasion and win it. We are at peace and we believe things will work out for us. We hadn't beaten Germany in many years but pages turn. We know it's going to be very tough but that is the nature of finals. Spain are very confident, have not lost in 24 [competitive] games but we have our own weapons. We believe it's going to work out for us.\"\nLuis de la Fuente, Spain coach: \"You don't always come up against such good teams. Four of the best five teams in Europe are here. It's a super tough competition, very demanding, a lot of prestige and will be valued as time goes by. Every rival is difficult but Portugal are a powerful national team. They have so much talent, so versatile, fast, there are certain similarities to us in the players and ideas. With our versatility, we will try to surprise them, we will try to use our strengths, and everything we can to try to beat them.\"\nMikel Oyarzabal, Spain forward: \"I know how these things go. The idea is to be quite tranquil in your mind, to speak to the people that you care for, around you, to enjoy the fact that my family and friends can be with me tomorrow and I hope they enjoy the game. I'll just try to forget everything that’s going on until the moment comes when the coach names the team and if I'm chosen, then I'll be ready.\"\nForm guide (most recent first)\nPortugal: WWLDWD\nSpain: WDDWWW\nNations League finals fixtures\nSemi-finals\n4 June: Germany 1-2 Portugal (Munich Football Arena)\n5 June: Spain 5-4 France (Stuttgart Arena)\nThird-place play-off\n8 June: Germany vs France (Stuttgart Arena, 15:00 CET)\nFinal\n8 June: Portugal vs Spain (Munich Football Arena)\nAll kick-offs 21:00 CET unless otherwise stated.\nLatest Stories\n-\nBooming Indicators, Dying Rivers: Ghana under Chronic Environmental Poisoning\n3 minutes -\nThe Accra Mandate: Securing Africa’s AI Future through Local Data and Ethical Governance\n32 minutes -\nAquafresh donates to National Chief Imam ahead of Ramadan\n57 minutes -\nAdopt a mix of bond and short-term finance to address financing challenges in cocoa industry – Professor Peprah to government\n59 minutes -\nNSA introduces dual authentication system for 2025/26 enrolment exercise\n2 hours -\nFuel prices to increase from Feb. 16, influenced by cedi’s depreciation\n3 hours -\nGNFS to launch automated fire safety compliance system to modernise regulation\n3 hours -\nNALAG president commends Local Gov’t Minister for payment of assembly members’ allowances\n3 hours -\nIs having a physical security operations center in your business worth it?\n3 hours -\nAsiedu Nketia recounts fierce political wars in Ajumako-Enyan-Essiam constituency\n3 hours -\nNRSA sets up committee to probe road crashes involving Toyota Voxy\n3 hours -\nCocoa farmers decry the adverse impact of producer price cut on livelihoods\n3 hours -\nFamilies who lose relatives to ‘no bed syndrome’ must sue health facilities – Dr. Nawaane\n3 hours -\nGhana Sports Fund: Dr. David Kofi Wuaku outlines vision for Youth Empowerment growth through sports\n4 hours -\nNUGS President urges sustainable digital governance\n4 hours",
