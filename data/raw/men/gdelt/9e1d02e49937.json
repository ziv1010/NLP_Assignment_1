The preliminary fixtures will be played in late August.\nMeanwhile, it is worth mentioning that the South Sudanese teams have no standard home ground approved by CAF as Juba stadium is still on renovation. War-torn Sudan is also not in a position to host the games.\nOn Monday, Al-Salam FC Head Coach Mr. Mangong Gai said the issue of the home ground it will remain as a big problem, although his side are ready to try their luck.\nHe added that the only money they currently have is about 20 thousand US dollars that they received from the national football governing body SSFA.\nHe said they will likely use the money to hire a stadium although it will not be enough.\n“When we won the league, SSFA has given us 20 thousand USD and that is the only money we have now,” he said in an interview with Eye Radio.\n“We are struggling to mobilize more, we as Salaam Bor FC we supposed to use Juba Stadium but now is uncompleted, so we may play our two games in the opponent stadium and we may use that fund for hiring the stadium,” Gai said.\nOn his part, the Secretary-General of El-Mereikh FC Juba said their aspiration to be the first team to play at the under-construction Juba International Stadium is now in vain.\nHe told Eye Radio they will now be forced to choose the closest country to their opponent.\n“We were hoping to play our home game at Juba stadium as we played our international game in this stadium on date fifth December 2018,” he said.\n“But this never happened according to our expectation. Our hope was to be the first team to play in after renovation, but it is never the case.”\n“Now is according to the draw to direct you, you have chosen the country near to your opponent, this is the situation we are in and is too difficult to us,” Kamal said.\nOn Monday, the South Sudan Football Association has reminded the two team yesterday about the CAF registrations that will end on the 31st this month.\nIn a statement seen by Eye Radio, SSFA urged the two clubs to make sure all the requirements are met, and the registration process is completed to avoid any issues with CAF.\nPrevious Post\nChinese foreign minister Qin Gang removed from office\nChinese foreign minister Qin Gang removed from office\nSupport Eye Radio, the first independent radio broadcaster of news, information & entertainment in South Sudan.\nMake a monthly or a one off contribution.\nCopyright 2026.
