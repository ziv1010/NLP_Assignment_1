The attacking midfielder clearly has the ability to shine in the Champions League for years to come.\nLeverkusen have opened dialogue with Wirtz’s camp as they try to tie him down to a new contract which includes a gigantic €150million (£128m / $171m) release clause.\nBut it is unclear whether Wirtz is happy to sign such a deal as he knows some of the most successful clubs in the world are chasing him.\nLeverkusen will have to lower their demands if the playmaker refuses to pen fresh terms, likely to between €100-130m (up to £111m / $148m).\nTBR Football have now provided an update on Wirtz’s situation. It is claimed that Man City are ‘making progress in their quest to land Wirtz this summer’.\nMan City are ‘confident’ about snaring the Germany star as they ‘feel he will leave Leverkusen at the end of the season’.\nThe Cityzens want to make Wirtz a ‘marquee signing’ as they prepare for life without current playmaker Kevin De Bruyne.\nNew City sporting director Hugo Viana has ‘promised Wirtz he will replace De Bruyne and take his place’ in the starting eleven.\nCity have ‘assured Wirtz that he will be vital to their plans… as the heartbeat of their side’, and this ‘guarantee’ has impressed the 21-year-old.\nThe report adds that so far, Wirtz’s father – who represents him – has ‘only held talks with City, Madrid and Bayern’.\nREAD NEXT 🌐\nChelsea plot astonishing Kevin De Bruyne reunion as three PL clubs linked with Man City icon\nPep Guardiola ‘orders’ Man City to pay £171m for TWO Real Madrid midfielders\nFlorian Wirtz set for stunning move\nThat is despite it being claimed on Wednesday that Liverpool are prepared to rival City for the supreme talent after ‘identifying him as a summer target’.\nIt emerged last week that Bayern have held ‘secret talks’ with Wirtz’s entourage as they try to get the jump on their transfer rivals.\nWirtz’s family have been impressed by the lengths the Bavarians are going to in an attempt to secure a deal. Wirtz himself, however, is also very tempted by the prospect of shining away from Germany with either City or Madrid.\nWe revealed on February 12 that Pep Guardiola had handpicked Wirtz as his ideal successor for De Bruyne in the No 10 role.\nMan City transfers: Star ‘accepts’ move; shock United link\nMeanwhile, a £64m target has given City the ‘green light’ to sign him this summer after contacts ‘intensified’ in recent days.\nDe Bruyne could be followed out of the Etihad by a City academy graduate, though.\nRivals Manchester United are monitoring his situation in a surprise twist, it has been claimed.",
