  "body_text": "IT is not May yet and we already have our Premier League champions!\nCongratulations to Liverpool for winning their 20th league title, equalling the number of league titles won by their greatest rivals, Manchester United.\nLiverpool, with six European Cups compared to United’s three, could currently be considered as the most successful English club.\nMany rivals may downplay this title, but Liverpool deserved it for being the most consistent team in the league.\nThis is not a Cup tournament where a team can get hot at the right time to win it all. To win the league, you need to be consistent across 38 games.\nArsenal fans could blame their injury luck or the conspiracy against PGMOL (Professional Game Match Officials Limited) to prevent Mikel Arteta’s side from winning the title, but looking at the league table, too many draws cost Arsenal the title.\nPerhaps Arteta will be braver next season in chasing three points. Perhaps a better transfer policy could help the Gunners in future campaigns.\nLots of perhaps but football is a game of 90 minutes, and everything has to be earned, not given.\nThis season, Liverpool earned every single win, and Arne Slot joins a prestigious list that includes Jose Mourinho (2004–05), Carlo Ancelotti (2009–10), Antonio Conte (2016–17), and Manuel Pellegrini (2013–14) by winning the Premier League in his first attempt.\nLet’s evaluate Liverpool’s key winning factors in winning the Premier League:\n- Don’t change what isn’t broken\nSlot inherited a championship-calibre squad from Jurgen Klopp. His primary job was to build on and improve the outstanding squad left behind, which averaged 80.33 points in Klopp’s last three seasons at Anfield.\nNo major tweaks were required, just minor ones. Less gung-ho, better discipline, resulting in 25 wins after 34 games. Some managers are eager to stamp their mark on a squad, but Slot chose the alternative.\nA 4D chess move by Slot. A brilliant manager knows what he has and makes the best out of it with small tweaks and his squad definitely delivered!\nNo major transfers, just poaching Martin Zubimendi was Slot’s main target, but that transfer did not materialise.\nThey only acquired Federico Chiesa, but that did not deter Slot in his quest for glory.\nHe repurposed Ryan Gravenberch as the six for Liverpool to a scintillating effect. It shows that you can build a winning team with training, not just transfers.\nPerhaps other managers in the league could take note.\n- Understanding your players\nBye-bye rock and roll football, hello control! He made tweaks to reduce the intensity of the playing style, including changes in training methods.\nPreviously under Klopp, the high-intensity football resulted in lots of injuries. Slot looked at things differently, and this led to a better injury record than their rivals.\nIt also helped players such as Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk to have seasons of their lives, especially Salah.\nIntroducing a coffee bar at the training ground helped build a strong camaraderie among the players, taking the squad to even greater heights.\nWhile there are many positives, Slot is not perfect. Trusting players too much could be a weakness he carries from his first season.\nIt resulted in less impressive performances in the Carabao Cup Final, the FA Cup, and the Champions League.\nStill, these are lessons Slot can work on during the summer. A Premier League title in his first attempt is no small feat, and Liverpool fans will certainly accept it.\nIt’s only upwards from here!\n- The top five race heats up\nThe top five is heating up as Newcastle United relegated Ipswich Town with a 3–0 win at St James’ Park.\nThe Magpies are now five points behind Arsenal, with everything still to play for. The win is a wonderful bounce-back after their recent defeat and keeps Eddie Howe’s men ahead of Manchester City, who got a dramatic winner midweek against Aston Villa.\nWith Chelsea beating Everton, the race for the Champions League spots is truly the saving grace of the season.\nWith the top five teams playing each other until the end of the campaign, anything is possible.\nWe could yet see a grandstand finish for the Champions League spots!\nWolves: The Kingmakers?\nWatch out for Wolves – the most in-form team in the league with six wins in a row. They could play the role of kingmakers, influencing who among the current top five qualifies for the Champions League.\nAs for Liverpool, congratulations again on winning the Premier League. Enjoy your perch!",
