They are also yet to make a decision on whether to sign Bayern Munich loanee Joao Palhinha permanently.\nTottenham have long-term interest in the former Chelsea man and did look into a deal before he joined Atleti for £34m.\nThe coming days will be crucial in the race for Gallagher’s signature.\nWant more breaking transfer lines from original sources?

In fact, the 26-year-old has started just three times in LaLiga this term.\nDiaz can play as a right or left-winger or as an attacking midfielder, so could provide cover in multiple positions for Tottenham.\nAccording to Spanish outlet Fichajes, Tottenham have put a £52m (€60m / $70m) offer on the table for the Moroccan forward, who is currently playing a starring role for his country at AFCON.\nDiaz made history on Friday as he became the first Moroccan player ever to score in five consecutive AFCON matches in a single edition, with his side booking a semi-final spot with victory over Cameroon.\nMadrid are said to be considering the offer, according to the report.\nHowever, it’s worth noting that Fichajes have a history of making bold claims and the vast majority of them do not come to fruition, so their reporting must be taken with a big pinch of salt.\nSpurs divided over Thomas Frank sack\nMeanwhile, our insider Bailey revealed in an update today that Tottenham’s decision-makers are split over whether to sack Frank.\nA source has exclusively told us how club CEO Vinai Venkatesham was warned by some members of Spurs’ hierarchy that Frank was not a good fit in terms of his system and the squad.\nThe source exclusively told us: “Vinai feels Thomas is such a great fit for Spurs in so many ways. A great person, character, who is well-liked, but he was warned that the system would not be a fit.\n“There is a real concern in the club, up high, that this is how things are playing out. The players like Thomas, but do they believe in what he is asking? That is the worry.”\nGet the inside story first by joining our TEAMtalk Facebook channel to receive the latest breaking and exclusive news straight into your Messenger inbox.",
