We’re 11 games in and still this inconsistency, this high line, he’s still operating. It must be a worry.”\nPardew added: “When you look at the stats – Spurs have won five and lost five, drawn one, 23 goals for and 13 against – it’s got the markings of a very, very mediocre season unfortunately.”\nSpurs brought in teenage stars Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall over the summer and Pardew fears it does not smack of huge ambition.\n“I did say at the start of the season that Tottenham’s transfer policy didn’t smack of a team who were trying to win the league – it looked like a team who were trying to rebuild with younger players and hopefully getting a few nuggets somewhere down the line.”\nREAD MORE: Ange Postecoglou hits back at Tottenham legend Hugo Lloris over stinging Levy criticism\nPardew offers Postecoglou advice as Spurs boss acknowledges his own failures\nWe understand that while Tottenham expect to be challenging for the top four, there is no long-term concerns over Postecoglou’s future. Given the tightness of the Premier League table, Tottenham, while currently down in 10th, only remain three points adrift of the top four.\nSuccessive defeats – to Galatasaray on Thursday in the Europa League and Ipswich on Sunday – is not an ideal way in which to enter an international break, but the club know that a couple of wins when they return to action can set the tone for a push up the table.\nHowever, with their next game coming at champions Manchester City and then Roma in the Europa League, Spurs will then be tested when they take on two sides in Fulham and Bournemouth who are themselves looking to push into that upper echelons of the Premier League.\nPostecoglou has won admirers for his straight-talking nature and he admitted after Sunday’s defeat that any failures rested on him and that he would work hard to put things right.\n“It’s just down to me. I’m not getting consistent performances from the players,” he told the media.\n“It’s something I need to address. I’m the person in charge so that’s usually the way it goes.\n“I take responsibility when their performances don’t meet the levels that they should.”\nOffering advice to Postecoglou, Pardew – who has not worked in English football since leaving West Brom in 2018 – added: “When you have a bad performance as a manager looking crestfallen isn’t the greatest gift that you can give to your fans.\n“You need to say ‘we didn’t have a good day, we had issues and we’re going to bounce back next week’.”\nLatest Tottenham transfer news: Reguilon’s exit plan / Real Madrid accelerate Spurs raid\nSpurs, meanwhile, could be set to part ways with Sergio Reguilon amid claims the out-of-favour Spaniard could be set to have his contract cancelled in N17.\nReguilon has only made the matchday squad once this season – in a Carabao Cup clash at Coventry – and is a long way down the pecking order under Postecoglou.\nAs a result, it’s reported that Spurs could grant the player a free transfer, with Reguilon having already lined up his next move.\nElsewhere, Tottenham will also reportedly face a battle to retain the services of Cristian Romero in the January window amid claims Real Madrid are ready to raise their efforts to prise the Argentine to the Bernabeu.\nLos Blancos have lost another defender in Eder Militao to a season-ending injury, leaving Carlo Ancelotti short of options. However, any move for the World Cup winning Tottenham star will not come cheap.\nAnd finally, Tottenham have reportedly joined the growing race to sign attacking midfielder Facundo Buonanotte, who is currently excelling on loan at Leicester City.\nHis parent club, Brighton, are reportedly open to the Argentine’s sale, though his apparent asking price may cause Daniel Levy to think twice.",
