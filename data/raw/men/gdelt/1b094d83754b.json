  "body_text": "Follow live coverage of today’s Conference League final between Betis and Chelsea\nThe reworked Club World Cup kicks off on June 14, less than two full weeks after the end of this weekend’s Champions League final.\nFor some clubs, the tournament in the United States extends a campaign that began with their pre-season last July. For others, it’s a chance to sort out their priorities for 2025-26. Most of the 32 competing sides are expected to name strong squads, given the prize money and brand exposure on offer in a rapidly growing football market.\nAdvertisement\nPlayers and managers have raised concerns, however, about the volume of games and reduced rest time between matches and seasons.\nOne of FIFA’s measures to address this involves an extra transfer period, from June 1-10, for Club World Cup teams to bring in players ahead of the tournament, given that the summer window proper only opens on June 16. Soon-to-be free agents on contracts that expire at the end of June could be available to their new employers for minimal fees.\nThe Athletic has picked out some players who are in that situation and could be targeted by Club World Cup participants.\nCristiano Ronaldo\nRonaldo’s future was already a question mark, with his contract at Saudi Arabia’s Al Nassr, who are not in the tournament, ending on June 30. It has now come squarely into focus after FIFA president Gianni Infantino said the 40-year-old “might play” at the Club World Cup and that “there are discussions with some clubs” during YouTuber iShowSpeed’s stream last week.\nRonaldo’s post on social media on Monday, when Al Nassr played the final match of their season, then created more conversation. He posted a photo of himself in an Al Nassr jersey on X with the caption, “This chapter is over. The story? Still being written. Grateful to all.”\nThis chapter is over.\nThe story? Still being written.\nGrateful to all. pic.twitter.com/Vuvl5siEB3— Cristiano Ronaldo (@Cristiano) May 26, 2025\nWherever Ronaldo goes, drama follows. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner’s two-and-a-half seasons in capital city Riyadh have brought 93 goals in 105 matches, controversies, tantrums, and less-than-pleasant gestures to crowds but no major domestic or Asian titles.\nIt is unclear whether Ronaldo will make a move in time to appear in this summer’s tournament — could we see a last dance with long-time rival Lionel Messi, whose MLS team Inter Miami are participating in it?\nAdvertisement\nTrent Alexander-Arnold\nAlexander-Arnold confirmed on May 5 that he will be leaving Liverpool this summer as a free agent, and he is expected to join Real Madrid. But while the process of Madrid hoovering up big names after their contracts expire may have been seamless in previous years — as it has been with their signings of Kylian Mbappe, Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba — the Club World Cup has added a layer of complexity.\nMadrid’s first-choice right-back Dani Carvajal is still recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee injury suffered last October. That leaves Lucas Vazquez — whose contract expires at the end of next month (two weeks into the Club World Cup) — as their only current senior option at the position. Madrid could negotiate with Liverpool on a fee that would allow them to sign Alexander-Arnold before the tournament begins.\nThe 26-year-old England full-back will depart Anfield after nine years with the first team that brought 352 appearances, 23 goals, 86 assists and eight domestic, European and world trophies.\nJonathan Tah\nTah confirmed in April that he will be moving on from Bayer Leverkusen this summer, with the German club making it official in early May.\nThe Athletic reported over the weekend that Bayern Munich have a deal to sign the 29-year-old on a free transfer once his Leverkusen contract expires next month, and he could yet move earlier to feature for them at the Club World Cup. No agreement for that to happen has been reached yet. Three Bayern centre-backs, Dayot Upamecano, Kim Min-jae and Hiroki Ito, missed the end of the German season with injuries, leaving the team short-staffed in defence.\nTah made 402 appearances over 10 years for Leverkusen, playing a leading role in their unbeaten domestic campaign in 2023-24.\nPaul Pogba\nIn January, Pogba completed an 18-month ban for an anti-doping rule violation. No move has yet materialised, and he remains a free agent. The 32-year-old last played a competitive match in September 2023, for Juventus against Empoli.\nAdvertisement\nBefore his suspension, Pogba was viewed as one of the most skilled midfielders in football. Consistency was an issue, but he made 423 combined appearances for Manchester United and Juventus — neither of whom have really replaced what he offered at his peak — and 91 for France.\nHis trophy cabinet includes a World Cup, four Serie A titles and the Europa League, and players seldom lose the kind of natural ability Pogba has.\nJorginho\nJorginho is another impending free agent with his next club already lined up. The Athletic reported this month that Brazilian club Flamengo, who will play in this Club World Cup, are in negotiations with Arsenal to find an agreement to let him leave the London side before his contract expires on June 30.\nThe Brazil-born Italy international, 33, started just nine Premier League matches this season, dropping behind Thomas Partey and Mikel Merino in the holding-midfield pecking order.\nJorginho’s ability to dictate the tempo of games and his vast experience, with 423 Premier League, Serie A, Champions League and Europa League appearances and 57 Italy caps, make him look a handy pre-tournament acquisition.\nSerge Aurier\nAurier has been a free agent since leaving Turkey’s Galatasaray in July last year. He has kept himself in shape, though, by joining up with a fitness coach who has worked with Karim Benzema, Ryan Gravenberch and Aaron Wan-Bissaka in recent years.\nThe now 32-year-old defender made only 17 league appearances in 2024 for Nottingham Forest and Galatasaray, and has topped 2,000 minutes of playing time in a top-flight season just once in the past decade (with Tottenham in 2019-20). Aurier, who has also made 93 appearances for the Ivory Coast national team, might be rusty but could still do a job for one of the non-European teams at the Club World Cup.\nAdvertisement\nAlexandre Lacazette\nLacazette is set to leave Lyon for the second time in his career this summer after 11 years with their first team (2009-17 and 2022-25, either side of five seasons with Arsenal). He scored 201 times in 391 appearances for the Ligue 1 side, winning France’s FA Cup equivalent once and their Community Shield twice.\nHe turns 34 today (Wednesday), so Lacazette’s best years are obviously behind him, but 19 goals in 42 all-competitions games over the season just ended prove he can still find the back of the net with reasonable consistency.\nAngel Di Maria\nDi Maria is another high-profile impending free agent, with his contract at Benfica expiring after a productive two-season second spell at the Lisbon side that brought 32 goals and 25 assists in 88 matches and two winners’ medals in the Portuguese cups.\nA world champion with Argentina in 2022, Di Maria is approaching the end of his career at age 37, but is more than capable of offering a team some added attacking punch from the bench. The winger has confirmed he is leaving Benfica this summer — but not when. It could be before or after the Club World Cup.\nHis trophy cabinet also includes the Copa America twice, a Champions League and multiple other trophies with Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Benfica and Argentina. The Club World Cup is one of the few competitions he has not won.\nCarney Chukwuemeka\nChukwuemeka’s time at Chelsea seems to be ending after three years, following an unsuccessful loan to Borussia Dortmund for the second half of this season. He made just one Bundesliga start, and ended the campaign with 452 minutes of first-team football played across the two clubs.\nDortmund look unlikely to make his move permanent, and he does not appear to be in Chelsea’s plans either. A permanent move away seems to make sense for both player and club and getting it done before this tournament would give the talented midfielder, still only 21, a chance to get his career back on track.\nLoan returnees and others who could be on the move\n- Staying with Chelsea, the club have made June 1 the expiry date for most of their on-loan players’ deals, ensuring they are back with them for the Club World Cup. Joao Felix, Axel Disasi, Raheem Sterling and Ben Chilwell, as well as Armando Broja, whose return has been confirmed by Everton, could be involved in the tournament if Chelsea and coach Enzo Maresca want them to be. That said, they could easily have their expiring loans turned into permanent transfers or move elsewhere.\n- Andrey Santos could also be part of Chelsea’s squad in the States, having bid farewell to their French sister club Strasbourg via an Instagram post on May 19. The 21-year-old recorded 11 goals and four assists in 34 matches this season, with multiple impressive performances.\n- Other high-profile impending free agents across Europe include Jonathan David, Angel Gomes, Leroy Sane, Christian Eriksen, Victor Lindelof, Abdoulaye Doucoure and Sergio Reguilon.\n- Multiple players out on loan from teams participating in the Club World Cup are contracted until June 30 with other teams heading for the tournament, which adds another layer of complexity. Randal Kolo Muani (at Juventus from PSG), Francisco Conceicao (at Juventus from Porto), Renato Sanches (at Benfica from PSG), and Tiago Djalo (at Porto from Juventus) are among the big names on that particular list.\n(Top photos of Cristiano Ronaldo, left, and Trent Alexander-Arnold: Getty Images)",
