Attendees exchanged knowledge and ideas with other coaches from across Europe, while also contributing towards their official UEFA coaching licenses.\nWith the semi-finals and final of the 2023/24 UEFA Youth League coming up from 19-22 April in Nyon, coaches from the four finalists – Olympiacos, Nantes, FC Porto and Milan – were among those in attendance.\nWords of advice from experienced leaders\nHearing from seasoned coaches who have reached the top of the game was invaluable for Youth League trainers, with many still in the early stage of their careers, and some in their first coaching roles.\nIn response to a question about helping youth players make the step up to senior level, Lopetegui emphasised the need for coaches to not only focus on football. \"There are players with more talent than others who don't develop because of bad decision-making,\" he said. \"And there are players with less talent who develop faster because they understand the game and how to face different challenges throughout their career.\n\"All of that is part of the training that should be provided by coaches. We have a responsibility to evolve both on a technical and emotional level, because the better the coaches are, the better the players become.\"\nAnother topic of discussion was the importance of data in modern football and how both managers have integrated this into their methods. While acknowledging the importance of data, Karanka also urged caution when it comes to young players.\n\"With artificial intelligence, there's more and more information available to us, and we need to stay updated with this,\" he said. \"But as coaches, it's also difficult to give players much more information than we already do. Sometimes, there's so much information that we might be limiting the player. This is something we need to think about when we communicate and train.\"\nShaping the future of the UEFA Youth League\nThe 2023/24 UEFA Youth League will be the final edition in the tournament's current guise as we move into a new format that emulates upcoming changes to the UEFA Champions League.\nUEFA presented these changes, which include an expanded field of teams featuring clubs from all UEFA national associations, and a league stage that mirrors the new Champions League format.\nOther highlights from the Coaching Forum\nCoaches from Real Sociedad, Chelsea, Benfica and PSV Eindhoven shared some of the reasons for their success in creating player development pathways to promote talent from youth teams into the senior ranks. Discussions centred around exploring effective talent development methods, key challenges facing successful transitions into the senior game, and best practices for coaches and their clubs.\nCoaches also received analysis on themselves, with UEFA's Intelligence Centre breaking down the data on the average age and experience of the coaches, as well as their players, from the European Club Talent and Competition Landscape.\nJes Buster Madsen, head of Research and Development at Copenhagen, gave a talk on integrating neuroscience into football, while Meagan Loyst, Founder of Gen Z VCs, presented ways to better understand young players and optimise their development.\nOther topics covered included identifying and managing talent, navigating the transition in football talent management, and a presentation from UEFA chief refereeing officer Roberto Rosetti on the Laws of the Game, exploring and explaining interpretations of offside and handball laws, as well as outlining UEFA's mission to create more respect for match officials.",
