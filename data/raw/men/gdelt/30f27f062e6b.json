Manchester United v Chelsea - 2008 Champions League\nThe 2008 Champions League Final, held in Moscow, featured Manchester United and Chelsea in the competition's first all-English final.\nCristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring for Manchester United with a header, but Frank Lampard equalised for the Blues before half-time.\nThe match ended 1–1 after extra time, leading to a dramatic penalty shootout. Ronaldo missed his spot-kick, but Chelsea captain John Terry slipped and missed the potential winner.\nEdwin van der Sar then saved Nicolas Anelka’s penalty, giving United a 6–5 shootout victory. It was Manchester United’s third European Cup title and continues to be seen as a memorable night in Champions League history.\n3. Chelsea vs Arsenal - 2019 Europa League\nThe 2019 Europa League Final, held on May 29 in Baku, saw Chelsea defeat Arsenal 4–1 in an all-English showdown.\nAfter a goalless first half, Olivier Giroud opened the scoring for Chelsea in the 49th minute with a header from Emerson's cross. Pedro doubled the lead in the 60th minute, finishing a fine pass from Eden Hazard.\nHazard then converted a penalty in the 65th minute following a foul on Giroud by Ainsley Maitland-Niles. Arsenal briefly responded with Alex Iwobi's powerful strike in the 69th minute.\nHowever, Hazard sealed the victory with his second goal in the 72nd minute, assisted by Giroud. This win secured Chelsea's second Europa League title and guaranteed their qualification for the 2019/20 Champions League.\n4. Liverpool vs Tottenham - 2019 Champions League\nThe 2019 Champions League Final, held on June 1 in Madrid, saw Liverpool defeat Tottenham Hotspur 2–0 to secure their sixth European Cup title.\nThe match began dramatically when Mohamed Salah converted a penalty in the second minute after Moussa Sissoko handled the ball inside the box.\nTottenham dominated possession but struggled to break down Liverpool's defence, with goalkeeper Alisson making crucial saves throughout.\nIn the 87th minute, substitute Divock Origi sealed the victory, capitalising on a corner that wasn't cleared. Virgil van Dijk's commanding performance earned him the Man of the Match award.\n5. Chelsea vs Manchester City - 2021 Champions League\nThe 2021 UEFA Champions League final took place on May 29 in Porto, Portugal, where Chelsea defeated Manchester City 1-0 to claim their second title.\nKai Havertz scored the decisive goal in the 42nd minute, latching onto a Mason Mount through ball and rounding goalkeeper Ederson.\nChelsea's disciplined defence, marshalled by the midfield antics of N'Golo Kanté, who was named Man of the Match, frustrated City’s attack throughout. Pep Guardiola's decision to play without a traditional defensive midfielder drew criticism.\nChelsea, under Thomas Tuchel, displayed tactical solidity and composure, securing victory in a hard-fought contest between two Premier League sides. It also capped a remarkable turnaround since Tuchel's appointment earlier that season.\nMatthew Holt writes freelance for FourFourTwo, amongst others, and boasts previous experience at GOAL and SPORTBible.
