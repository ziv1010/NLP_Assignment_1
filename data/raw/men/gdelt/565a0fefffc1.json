They had just lost their first two Euros group-stage games — 1-0 to Switzerland, 2-0 to Portugal — and, despite beating Croatia 2-1 in the following match, England were eliminated on goal difference after conceding in the 91st minute.\nAdvertisement\nTwo years and three months later, the team’s head coach is now Lee Carlsey and England are in the semi-finals of the 2023 Euros in Georgia; a new generation of players led by different staff, who have, from the objective perspective of how far they have progressed in this tournament, been more successful than their predecessors.\nTo get to the semi-final, England won all three of their Euros group matches — beating the Czech Republic 2-0; Israel 2-0; and 2021 finalists Germany 2-0 — which they have never done before. They then beat the other 2021 finalists Portugal 1-0 in the quarter-final. For all their attacking talent, all four of England’s wins were underpinned by clean sheets.\nBoothroyd’s words in 2021 were not unfounded. Despite the success England have had in Euros and World Cups with age groups under-17 to under-20, reaching finals aplenty and winning numerous trophies, England exited in the groups at five of the last six Under-21 Euros — stretching back to 2011, when the academy-revolutionising Elite Player Performance Plan was introduced.\nAt senior level, that tournament record would be a significant failure, as success can be measured by trophies. At youth level, it is more complex. Take France, who have not won the Under-21 Euros since 1998 and this year were eliminated in the quarter-finals for the second tournament running, this time losing 3-1 to Ukraine.\nOn paper, they have the best squad, stacked with Champions League and Europa League experience, which for a youth side is in itself a success but might not win trophies. At youth level, France develop individuals, not necessarily teams.\nPresnel Kimpembe, Benjamin Pavard, Thomas Lemar and Ousmane Dembele were all part of France’s under-21 squad that failed to even qualify for the 2017 Euros — North Macedonia topped their qualifying group. However, those four players were then part of the 2018 World Cup-winning senior side in Russia. Theo Hernandez and Adrien Rabiot were also in that under-21 team, key figures in the 2022 World Cup side that reached the final.\nAdvertisement\n“We are a team who knows how to suffer. They passed on the recipe,” said defender Jules Kounde after France’s semi-final win over Morocco in December. “They” are previous generations. Kounde played in the 2021 Under-21 Euros, where France finished second in their group and lost to the Netherlands in the quarter-finals. Ibrahima Konate, Benoit Badiashile, Aurelien Tchouameni, Eduardo Camavinga, Matteo Guendouzi and Randal Kolo Muani were all part of that team and all played for the senior team at the World Cup in Qatar, where France became the fifth nation to reach consecutive World Cup finals. They also won the 2020-21 Nations League and reached the Euros final on home soil in 2016.\nAt senior level, head coach Didier Deschamps has been in charge since 2012. The style and shape of that side mirror those of the under-21 team, streamlining the stepping-up process. Deschamps plays a pragmatic 4-2-3-1 with dribbling wingers, defending in a mid-block, so the under-21s follow.\nSimilarly, the passive 4-4-2 mid-block that France defended in against Italy is the exact same way France’s senior side defended at the World Cup in Qatar, positioning the No 10 next to the No 9.\nA perennially divisive topic within academy football is the balance between winning and developing players for senior sides such as Deschamps’. Whereas certain nations will adopt win-at-all-cost strategies — and many will be more prepared to do so the deeper they go into the tournament — it is clear that successful senior sides view under-21s as a stage on a pathway and opportunity to instil a winning mentality and tactics for the future.\nHarry Brooks, a coach and analyst who works independently with elite-level under-21 players, is of the view that under-21s tournaments are a learning opportunity rather than predictors of success. He tells The Athletic they offer players “experience and exposure to best educate them. Silverware may or may not be a part of that, but I do believe in competition and youth players being more exposed to what it means to win when it matters”.\nAdvertisement\nEngland’s senior success owes much to the development of a pathway from youth levels and a unified playing style that runs through all teams. Gareth Southgate’s side were the fifth-youngest team at the 2022 World Cup (quarter-finalists), third-youngest in 2018 (semi-finalists) and joint youngest at Euro 2020 (runners-up).\n“There’s a reason why we haven’t won this (Under-21 Euros) for 37 years and why we haven’t progressed as much as we thought we would,” said Boothroyd in 2021. “Because our primary aim is to get players through to Gareth.”\nEngland youth 2017-18:\nEuro U17 2017 🥈\nEuro U17 2018 SF\nEuro U19 2017 🏆\nEuro U19 2018 GS\nWorld Cup U17 🏆\nWorld Cup U20 🏆\nEuro U21 SF10 players from these teams are at Euro 2020: Pickford, Henderson, Chilwell, James, Mount, Foden, Grealish, Sancho, Saka & Calvert-Lewin. 🏴 pic.twitter.com/ewa3zgoqVS\n— Football Talent Scout – Jacek Kulig (@FTalentScout) June 10, 2021\nMatt Crocker, England’s head of player and coach development between 2013 and 2020 spoke of a “seamless structure” between age groups, with a “golden thread that runs through all the teams, that we’re coaching them consistently (…) we’re playing the same way, we’re selecting the talent in the same way to play the England way”.\nThe England ‘DNA’ was the introduction of that controlling, possession-based identity, which is shown in abundance by the current England Under-21 side, who had possession shares of 70, 68 and 54 per cent in their group-stage games and play in a particularly fluid shape. Going into the semi-finals, they have the highest average possession (59.2 per cent) and pass completion (89.8 per cent) of any country in the tournament.\nMax Aarons, normally a right-back, has played left-back and central midfielder James Garner has operated at right-back. England attack asymmetrically, pushing Aarons forward but keeping Garner back as right-winger Noni Madueke plays high and wide.\nCurtis Jones, Angel Gomes’ partner in central midfield, has been used as a false nine by Carsley in the past. In three of England’s four games, the exception being the group-stage win over Germany when England had already qualified, they played a narrow 4-4-2 without a recognised No 9. Morgan Gibbs-White (a No 10 at club level) and Anthony Gordon (a winger) were the ‘front two’ but played fluidly as part of a front four.\nEngland’s goals have encapsulated their style, scoring from long passing sequences that either carve teams apart centrally or use wide combinations to create crossing and cutback situations.\n3 – Three of the four goals scored following the longest passing sequences at the 2023 #U21EURO tournament have been netted by England:\n21 – Gordon v Israel\n21 – Smith Rowe v Israel\n20 – Kalimuendo v Italy\n18 – Ramsey v Czech Republic\nFluent. pic.twitter.com/Mmf5jcPFTB\n— OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) June 26, 2023\nBoth goals against Israel came from 21-pass sequences, originating from goalkeeper James Trafford.\nThis is the end of the move, with Gordon heading home the cross from Gibbs-White, the second time the ‘front two’ have combined to score in the tournament.\nEmile Smith-Rowe’s goal against Israel, England’s second, is evidence of success, regardless of whether England reach the final or lift the trophy. They have developed and are developing technically excellent individuals who can play possession systems and create goals that were more associated with the Spain national team 10 years ago.\nSmith-Rowe’s finish is excellent, firing low into the corner from just outside the box, but the intricate interplay before allowed him to find space in a condensed Israel defensive block.\nEngland’s winner in the quarter-finals over Portugal is another similar sequence. Build-up from deep, splitting the midfield into the No 10, creating a cutback situation from wide for a one-touch finish.\nPart of the reason England and France’s senior-focused approaches to under-21 teams have proved fruitless when it comes to trophies is the differences between age-group football. “Academy football is not realistic in comparison to first-team football with regards to the mindset, the demands, even the style of football that is played,” says Brooks. These are comments which have been proven by academic research.\nAdvertisement\nTwo papers from the University of Bournemouth — a 2013 paper and a 2021 paper, both published in the International Journal of Performance Analysis in Sport — identified that successful attacking sequences (ending in shots, final-third entries and goals) at academy level tend to contain fewer passes, be more direct, individualistic, and a higher proportion were from counter-attacking situations. Comparatively, at senior level, successful attacks were more commonly longer passing sequences against organised defences and often with crosses or cutbacks.\nDefences improve as players get older and tactically maturer, while early physical developers at academy level can use their advantages against ‘inferior’ opponents to win duels and score goals. It partly explains the ‘relative age effect’ — something inherent across academy team sports and not purely for football. This is where academies select a disproportionately high number of players born earlier in the academic year as they are typically the first to mature. But by senior level, all players have matured and those advantages either no longer exist or are reduced.\nSix of the past seven Under-21 Euros have been won by Germany or Spain, with those victories coming following their senior sides having international success (Germany 2014 World Cup winners, Spain 2010 World Cup winners and 2012 Euros winners). But Spain, this season’s Nations League winners, have reached just one senior semi-final (Euro 2020) in their last five major international tournaments. Germany have not reached a final since the 2014 World Cup, which they won.\nA 2022 paper from the University of Oslo analysed almost 1,500 European footballers born between 1990 and 1995. They identified that participation at youth international level was only a “limited predictor” of whether a player would reach the Champions League, Europa League or senior national team levels. If youth-level performance cannot predict that kind of success on an individual level, then it certainly cannot on a team level.\n“We’re not ready to go home yet,” Carsley said after the quarter-final win.”‘I still feel like there is a lot more from the team. I think they have different levels they can reach.”\nEngland are just two wins away from lifting a trophy they have not won since 1984, but they are succeeding regardless of whether they win or not. In a year’s time, England and France can be expected to be among the favourites for Euro 2024, where players from this tournament will undoubtedly reach new levels.",
