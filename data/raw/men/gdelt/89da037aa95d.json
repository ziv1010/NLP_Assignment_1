He’s been thrust into that position again.\n‘I thought he might leave Manchester United in the January window – he’s found it hard there. He’s been a great midfielder over the years but the Premier League is tough and it’s fast.\n‘Today he’s going to have to make sure he moves his feet well, and doesn’t go lunging into tackles. He’s got to use all of his experience.’\nAmorim appeared to effectively end Casemiro’s Manchester United career in January, admitting he cannot meet the ‘intensity’ required.\n‘We understand that Casemiro has other things nowadays,’ the former Sporting Lisbon boss Amorim said.\n‘The intelligence he has, understanding the game, understanding where the ball is going to fall but we’re in a league that I can see, even in European competitions, the difference in intensity is big.\n‘And so, I feel that this team also needs players with a very high intensity. And sometimes we don’t have that and sometimes that difference in characteristic can lead one player or another to play.\n‘Even the fact that the group has a certain characteristic as a group. I needed some players in certain positions with a slightly different pace.\n‘But we all know the quality Casemiro has and everything he won. And so, I have nothing to say about that. It’s just a choice.’\nBut Casemiro started at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday as Amorim was forced to field a hugely weakened team due to a number of absences.\nMore Trending\nRio Ferdinand, the Manchester United legend, said Casemiro should have left in January after being repeatedly overlooked by Amorim.\nDiscussing Casemiro’s situation, Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel: ‘Is the player happy to be on the bench?\n‘I don’t think Casemiro will be happy. At any point in his career he’s never been on the bench. If they get an offer they require, that they want, I don’t think it will be something that will be difficult to happen.\n‘If he wants to go and play football, who are we to stand in his way at this stage of his career.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Vitor Pereira fumes that Liverpool star should have been sent off against Wolves\nMORE: Arne Slot says Liverpool star is back after ‘hard time’ this season\nMORE: Gary Neville blasts ’embarrassing’ Ruben Amorim tactic during Tottenham vs Man Utd",
