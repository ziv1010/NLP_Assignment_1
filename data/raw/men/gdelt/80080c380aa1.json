We will look at things tomorrow morning,\" Galtier told reporters on Monday.\nBayern coach Julian Nagelsmann had previously suggested PSG were playing mind games when they announced the France superstar would not be fit for the first leg.\n\"I am assuming and anticipating that he is going to start. It is my job as head coach to be prepared for him playing and to try to prevent him from damaging us,\" Nagelsmann, who is without the injured Sadio Mane, said in Paris on Monday.\nMeanwhile Galtier denied that PSG were considering naming Mbappe as a substitute just to frighten their opponents in a repeat of the 2020 Champions League final, won 1-0 by the Germans in Lisbon.\n\"If he is on the teamsheet it will be to play, but I don't know how long it would be for,\" said the coach.\nLionel Messi and Marco Verratti were also named in the squad after sitting out PSG's 3-1 defeat at Monaco on Saturday, which was their second consecutive loss and their fourth in 10 games in 2023.\nThere have been doubts about Bayern's form too, but they have lost just once all season and sit top of the Bundesliga.\nPSG's slump has raised the spectre of another frustratingly early exit from the Champions League for the Qatar-owned club.\nThey have gone out of the competition in the final 16 in four of the last six campaigns, including last season against eventual winners Real Madrid.\nDressing-room arguments\nThe appointment of Galtier to succeed Mauricio Pochettino ahead of this season was made in the hope he could take them all the way in Europe, along with the huge contract offer that persuaded Mbappe to stay rather than move to Madrid.\n\"The team that we put out tomorrow (Tuesday) will look nothing like the team that played against Monaco,\" Galtier said after a stomach bug ripped through his already-weakened squad at the weekend.\n\"Bayern are a great side but I know that my players are capable of raising their game on these occasions.\"\nPSG remain five points clear at the top of Ligue 1 but the nature of their performance in Monaco added to the concerns surrounding Galtier's squad following their French Cup exit in Marseille last midweek.\nMedia reports surfaced following Saturday's game of a dressing-room argument involving Neymar, captain Marquinhos and the club's football advisor, Luis Campos, reports which Neymar confirmed on Monday, but sought to play down.\n\"There was a discussion, but it wasn't a punch-up,\" he said.\n\"These things happen every day. Football is not just love and friendship. Even with my girlfriend we don't agree sometimes, but obviously there is respect from all sides.\n\"We had a discussion but it was just about us trying to improve as a team. I think it helped quite a bit, to clarify certain things.\"\n© 2023 AFP",
