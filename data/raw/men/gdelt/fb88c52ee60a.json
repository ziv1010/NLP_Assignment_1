Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘Obviously, they’re not playing their very best,’ Owen said on Premier League Productions when asked about Liverpool’s form. ‘They have done in patches but have not been consistently very good.\n‘I do feel at the moment, they need to score the first goal because they are quite vulnerable and conceded chances.\n‘The confidence of keeping a clean sheet and winning another game after going away in Europe playing a tricky game… this is a seriously good team.\nCan Liverpool still win the Premier League?\n-\nThere's still a chance...\n-\nNo way!\n‘If everyone plays at their absolute peak, I still think Liverpool are the best team in the world. I do.\n‘They are obviously not showing it regularly but they won the league at a canter last year and they have signed incredible players, invested for the future and these players are going to come good.\n‘This is a team that aren’t going to go away and are going to be title contenders for the next five years. As much as they’re not playing very well, you’ve still got to be fearful of Liverpool.\n‘They have beaten Arsenal, Aston Villa and have gone away in Europe and are doing well in the Champions League.\n‘Everyone is talking about this disaster but they’re top six and fleeing high in the Champions League. It is not a disaster yet and there is a long way to go and these new signings are only going to get better.’\nOne of Liverpool’s biggest issues this season has been the underwhelming form of two hugely expensive summer signings.\nLiverpool record signing Alexander Isak, bought for £125m, has only scored two goals for his new club, while £115m recruit Florian Wirtz is yet to show his best form at Anfield.\nBut Owen insists Wirtz is ‘only going to get better’ and believes he could develop into a ‘special’ player for the reigning Premier League champions.\n‘He is only going to get better,’ Owen added. ‘He is so talented and gradually he’s getting there.\n‘You see a couple of things he does and you go, “Oh my word, this guy”. If he could do more of it then we’re going to be watching something pretty special in the future.\n‘He’s going to get better so there’s lots to be positive about. Liverpool aren’t purring at the moment but they will be soon, there’s no doubt about it.’\nLiverpool beat Brighton 2-0 on Saturday and return to Premier League action next weekend against inconsistent Tottenham.\nOwen was part of one of the last Manchester United teams to win the Premier League but says being awarded the Ballon d’Or award while he was at Liverpool means more to him.\n‘I’m extremely pleased and proud to have won the Premier League, but I wasn’t Wayne Rooney scoring 30 goals that season, I was a bit-part player,’ he told Midnite.\nMore Trending\n‘Of course, the Ballon d’Or is bigger. I made some contributions at Manchester United, but they would’ve won the Premier League if I was part of the squad or not.\n‘That’s why when people say that Steven Gerrard isn’t a Premier League great because he hasn’t won a Prem is ridiculous.\n‘Scott Carson has loads of Premier Leagues. Medals are important, but when you’re debating who’s a great player, I don’t really buy that argument.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Gabriel Magalhaes reveals why he mocked Amadou Onana after Arsenal beat Aston Villa\nMORE: ‘Fortunate’ – Ian Wright says Arsenal star ‘got away with one’ after Aston Villa win\nMORE: ‘Terrific’ Premier League star sent transfer message amid Man Utd interest",
