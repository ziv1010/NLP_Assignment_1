  "body_text": "We’ll get them back on Wednesday son\nThings, it has to be said, were feeling a bit low heading into this.\nThe Brighton game seems to have been a bit of a breaking point for many, as the continuation of failings from early in the season contributed to a highly disappointing home defeat.\nTwo points from a possible twelve, with no goals other than penalties in the last four games and a distinct lack of creativity made for a sour mood across an empty week watching other teams compete in Europe.\nComparisons with Villa, who seem to be managing the Champions League admirably without collapsing domestically, have not looked favourable for Eddie Howe and questioning of his position seemed to be creeping wider than just the most hysterical elements of the internet.\nSo, a result was needed and Eddie would not have asked for this forthcoming week of Chelsea, Chelsea, Arsenal if given a choice in turning things around.\nTo be fair, most right thinking individuals would surely be less reactive about the first round of the week, despite us sitting in a relatively alarming 12th position going into the game.\nChelsea away has always been a stinking fixture for United, with the comparative hope of the past couple of years delivering a draw, a loss on penalties and a disappointing defeat. With the Blues looking ominously back on form this season and the majority of their big hitters not involved in the midweek trek to Greece, this was the type of game you’d accept as an unlikely source of points. Unfortunately, it sat badly, as post-takeover we’ve grown used to taking trips with at least a semblance of hope. Coming here with only logic-defying thoughts of a positive outcome felt like a bit of a downer.\nDespite this, I was still looking forward to today more than any match in a long time. Why, I hear you ask? Perhaps I’m a bit daft, or one of these that’s into things that inflict misery and torture upon the self. Well, not quite.\nToday, some four and a half years after he first sat with me at St James’ Park for a stunning comeback win against Everton, my son Blake would be with me for his first ever away game. This was hastily arranged, after an outbreak of Covid in my friend’s house presented an early opportunity to take advantage of the new away ticket transfer scheme, as well as giving me the chance to spend loads and loads of money on both the relevant rearrangements and the entertainment of a ten year old.\nSaturday was spent bimbling round London, taking in the Paradox experience opposite Harrods (his mam did NOT get a present) and hitting Gordon Ramsay’s street burger. Life has changed a bit since I was ten mind. Game day, I filled him up with as much hotel breakfast as he could stomach and set off for Stamford Bridge.\nFirst off, massive respect to both the Earl’s Court Tavern and the Prince of Tecks for their early opening and hospitality that made for a smashing route to Chelsea. Secondly, I have to commend whoever is in charge of the beer at Stamford Bridge, as they persist in serving a very decent pint of Singha that puts the weak Carling/Carsberg offering at literally every other ground to utter shame. I felt better about the prospect of the game due to this well explored hospitality.\nBy this point Blake was well exposed to the extent of away day friends dad had introduced him to, and again, thanks to all for the kindness and warmth he was exposed to, which was a sharp contrast to what you might expect if you read the daft internet.\nAnyway, he soon got a degree of exposure to what Newcastle away games are, as Chelsea scored within a couple of minutes. The home ends went up, heads went down and the collective mood sagged. I felt a bit defiant though, as Cole Palmer seemed clearly offside when receiving Jackson’s pass before finishing. The linesman gave the goal and we had a glimpse of what the afternoon would bring from referee Simon Hooper, who would go on to give a very home friendly performance. For balance, I feel compelled to commend the efforts of VAR Jarred Gillett, whose positive interventions started with his correctly chalking off this non-goal as an indication of a display that was a solid endorsement of video refereeing, without which we’d have taken an unjust 10-12 goal hiding today.\nThis proved to be little more than a stay of execution unfortunately, as the home side took a legitimate lead 15 minutes later. A United attack failed typically but Palmer’s ball to initiate the counter attack was magnificent, releasing Neto on the left hand side. Schar’s fully committed two footer missed the Portuguese altogether and suddenly opened up a chasm which was easily exploited with a calm square ball that Jackson slotted past Pope. Blake seemed a bit taken aback by the sight of 90% of the ground cheering against you, maybe get used to it kidda.\nThere was a fear here that a collapse might follow. I didn’t want Blake to be leaving West London humbled by the deep-cutting horrors of a five or six goal hammering, so the reactionary brigade will have to forgive me for the positive recollection of the events that followed.\nUnited showed a bit of fight in the moments that followed but yet again there was little to threaten, bar the recalled Almiron’s wayward effort immediately after the opener. Then, with just over half an hour on the clock, Joelinton did well to control possession in the centre, offloading to Livramento who released the marauding Barnes. He played in Hall and his excellent centre was steered in from close range by Isak. I honestly won’t forget this goal ever. It was a nice, flowing move that was executed very well but it won’t stand out for the majority. However, Blake found himself totally overwhelmed by the response of an away goal in an away end, jumping on me and grabbing hold tightly in a way that was understood and appreciated by the hair rufflers and back slappers around us. It’s not the very best of times but stuff like this is timeless. I’m glad I was here today for this and the rest is just noise.\nI’m not sure how they found seven minutes of injury time, but would assume it was a mixture of Chelsea’s early VAR check and the unnecessary one of Isak’s perfectly good goal, again rightly dealt with by Mr Gillett. Half time and level felt OK, except everyone seemed set on a Singha and the Bridge’s long standing status was exposed, compared to your more recent grounds with their seemingly infinite bar space.\nThe way the game was lost was infuriating on a few levels. The fact we hadn’t had a hope to contemplate maybe snatching a win in the second half was particularly dispiriting, but the soft way Cole Palmer was allowed to finish inside Pope’s near post was secondary to the way possession was surrendered to him in the middle of the park and subsequently allowed to become a goal scoring opportunity, whereas such an occurrence for us leads only to pontification and regression. It felt like a stretch to come from behind again.\nFrustratingly, we should have done it. Isak chased down Schar’s long ball and suddenly found himself through on the right hand side after Fofana’s fluffed header. Sanchez came haring out of goal and Isak calmly rounded him, but dithered in his attempt to get a shot off while the unmarked Joelinton bellowed for the pass that would have brought a certain equaliser. Frustrating.\nJarred Gillett did have one final chance to counter the incompetence of Hooper, rightly overturning a penalty award given for Nkunku falling over his own feet, but it all added up to me escorting a downtrodden Blake away from his first ever long distance defeat.\nAs a seasoned traveller though, I count it as a win of sorts that he saw a competitive game in a welcoming environment and exited to nothing but positive comments from locals as his fatha sought out a few consolation scoops on Earl’s Court road. As many an old timer will tell you (whether you ask or not), it wasn’t always the way. I’m glad I shared this day with him at one of English football’s classic grounds and I hope today will be the fantastic memory for him that it already is for me.\nFor United though, this was the expected continuation of the deterioration of late. Yes, we scored from open play in difficult circumstances and we were at least contenders, albeit to a lesser extent than we would aspire to. However, we still lost at a relative canter and remain in the lower half of the table, some five points adrift of today’s opponents in the final European place.\nI would suggest that the biggest positive is yet to show itself.\nChelsea have the points today but they have not knocked us out of the Premier League. Reversing this outcome in 72 hours time will see us end them in the Carabao Cup, and the focus on that competition needs to be priority, both in terms of the shape of the season to date and the overall long term goal of turning this club into winners.\nIf we head into next weekend’s tricky fixture with Arsenal having progressed in that cup and (imagine) facing a decent home quarter final, it might take the sting out of the prospect of what position defeat to the Gunners could bring.\nIt’s a tricky time but not one for panic.\nI apologise to anyone who wants a revolution off the back of today but it will stick with me for many of the right reasons.\nThanks to my little pal for constantly reminding me of the important things in life and the absolute brilliance of the moments of raw happiness these days can bring.\nWe’ll get them back on Wednesday son.\nChelsea 2 Newcastle 1 – Sunday 27 October 2pm\n(Stats via BBC Sport)\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nIsak 32\nChelsea:\nJackson 18, Palmer 47\nPossession was Newcastle 49% Chelsea 51%\nTotal shots were Newcastle 11 Chelsea 17\nShots on target were Newcastle 3 Chelsea 7\nCorners were Newcastle 4 Chelsea 7\nTouches in the box Newcastle 26 Chelsea 32\nNewcastle United team v Chelsea:\nPope, Livramento, Schar, Burn, Hall (Kelly 89), Joelinton (Osula 89), Bruno, Tonali (Longstaff 68), Barnes (Willock 68), Isak, Almiron (Jacob Murphy 68)\nUNUSED SUBS:\nRuddy, Krafth, Lewis Miley, Vlachodimos\nYou can follow the author on Twitter @Mr_Dolf\n((BBC Sport comments from ‘neutrals’ – Interesting on Newcastle United after Chelsea defeat – Read HERE)\n(This is the time to back Eddie Howe and not sack him – Read HERE)\n(This perfectly sums up the divide between Chelsea and Newcastle United – Read HERE)\n(Chelsea 2 Newcastle 1 – Instant Newcastle United fan / writer reaction – Read HERE)\nNewcastle United upcoming matches confirmed to end of January 2025:\nWednesday 30 October – Newcastle v Chelsea (7.45pm) Sky Sports+\nSaturday 2 November – Newcastle v Arsenal (12.30pm) TNT Sports\nSunday 10 November – Forest v Newcastle (2pm) Sky Sports\nMonday 25 November – Newcastle v West Ham (8pm) Sky Sports\nSaturday 30 November – Crystal Palace v Newcastle\nWednesday 4 December – Newcastle v Liverpool (7.30pm) Amazon\nSaturday 7 December – Brentford v Newcastle (3pm)\nSaturday 14 December – Newcastle v Leicester (3pm)\nSaturday 21 December – Ipswich v Newcastle (3pm)\nThursday 26 December – Newcastle v Villa (3pm) Amazon\nMonday 30 December – Man U v Newcastle (8pm) Sky Sports\nSaturday 4 January – Tottenham v Newcastle (12.30pm) TNT Sports\nWednesday 15 January – Newcastle v Wolves (7.30pm) TNT Sports\nSaturday 18 January – Newcastle v Bournemouth (12.30pm) TNT Sports\nSaturday 25 January – Southampton v Newcastle (3pm)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
