  "body_text": "TORONTO – This summer is shaping up to be one of the most important in recent memory for the Canadian men’s national team.\nIt’s about to enter the Gold Cup as one of the tournament favorites. With a near-full strength squad, which sets itself apart from the U.S. men’s national team, Canada has one of its best opportunities to win its first trophy since 2000. Doing so would fill this team with confidence ahead of the 2026 World Cup on home soil.\nAdvertisement\nAnd for many of Canada’s players, the World Cup presents both a challenge and an opportunity this summer. They know Canada head coach Jesse Marsch wants his players logging heavy minutes on their club sides heading into the World Cup. How they approach this upcoming season could be crucial to where they land on the World Cup roster.\nFor the likes of, say, Alphonso Davies and Moïse Bombito, this summer might not be a priority. They know they’re in terrific standing with their clubs in top leagues and will use that to propel them towards the World Cup.\nBut for others, this summer represents a potentially pivotal moment to move to a new club – and possibly secure the playing time and the World Cup spot they’re after.\nAfter a week spent around Canada’s men’s national team in Halifax and Toronto, here’s what we’re hearing about the future of a number of key players.\nJonathan David, 25, forward, Lille\nThis status of this summer’s most discussed transfer option – not just in Canada, but across the soccer world – remains the same: David has options across Europe’s top leagues vying for his services. As things stand, he’s waiting for the right combination to emerge from an interested club: an attractive project (Champions League participation is justifiably high on his list of interests) and a financial package that makes sense.\n“I want a club with ambition that wants to do something,” David told The Athletic last week. “Obviously, I would love to fight for titles, to win titles. A team that’s competitive, that has ambition, really, with a good sporting project.”\nDon’t be surprised if David, linked heavily to Napoli and Juventus, stays true to himself and exercises patience throughout the summer. Participation in the Gold Cup feels more and more likely.\nIsmaël Koné, 22, central midfield, Marseille\nKoné’s high-profile transfer to Ligue 1’s Marseille last summer did not unfold as hoped: he made just nine appearances, drew the ire of manager Roberto de Zerbi and was loaned mid-season to Rennes.\nAdvertisement\nDespite being under contract, Koné is unlikely to return to Marseille, with another loan or permanent transfer on the table. The sticking point could be finding a club that wants to pony up the cash for Marseille after the Ligue 1 side paid in the region of £15 million for Koné last summer.\nA return to Rennes is still possible, but only if the club is willing to find the kind of money to turn Koné’s loan deal into a permanent buy option.\nCould he be on his way to another new club, his fourth in just over a year?\n“In football, there’s a lot of changes. So, I’d be OK with that,” he told The Athletic.\nThe experience in France was a humbling and eye-opening one for the prodigious No. 8. From the benefits of private physios to adding extra hours to his training regimen, Koné learned how vast the gap is between newcomers and those who compete regularly in Europe’s top leagues.\nFor his part, Koné seems to have a better understanding of how to be successful in Europe. He told The Athletic that in his next club, he wants “an environment where I can showcase my skills, my talent and I could just grow and learn, because that’s what I want to do: grow and progress and be the best player I can be. You’re never going find an organization that’s going guarantee (playing time), that just comes with work. For me it’s the most important is to find an environment where I could be myself and learn and grow.”\nPromise David, 23, forward, Union SG\nWhenever a forward bursts onto the scene by averaging a goal every 126 minutes en route to winning the Belgian Pro League, there’s going to be questions about that player’s future.\nDespite interest from clubs in France and England, though, the safe bet is for Promise David to stay in Belgium next season. He still has plenty to learn about the training demands of a European club. David will play more regularly next season as well, including in the Champions League.\nThe honesty David shared with The Athletic about a possible move should should speak for itself:\n“I’ve never been in a position where I have options to move,” David said. “People were telling me in January, a bunch of options started popping up. People were like, ‘Are you going to take off?’ And I was like, ‘The grass is f—ing green here.’ You can go somewhere else and maybe the grass isn’t as green as you thought. I mean technically you can say, ‘Yeah, I did conquer Belgium.’ And I didn’t play a full season but then – I didn’t even play a whole season. So maybe I should sit there and soak up as much training as possible. If my team decides to sell me, because they damn well can, I’m ready to go, but I’m happy with where I’m at. I’m not pressuring myself to go for it. If there’s a better option that suits both parties, and everybody’s happy with that, sure, why not? Pack up my bags and move. But I just extended my lease, it’d be a damn shame.”\nAdvertisement\nNathan Saliba, 21, central midfield, CF Montréal\nExpect the up-and-coming central midfielder to make a move this summer to Europe, with Belgium’s Anderlecht the frontrunner to sign him.\n“If the project is good for me, I would open to (a summer transfer), because I think for my future I would love to be able to get to play in Europe and experience that,” Saliba said.\nCanada’s coaches have come to adore how well Saliba owns the space in the middle of the park with his ball-winning ability, dribbling and size. They see what others around MLS have seen, as Saliba has stepped into a more regular starting position. Saliba needs to be pushed at a higher level to have a chance of winning starts at the World Cup, though.\nTajon Buchanan, 26, right midfield/back, Inter Milan\nOf the many positive takeaways from Canada’s 4-2 friendly win over Ukraine, Buchanan’s resurgence has to be at the top. Canada’s best player at the 2022 World Cup has fallen on trying times: a move to Inter Milan didn’t lead to consistent minutes, and a horrific injury at Copa América cut into his playing time and development. He only looked to be finding his footing toward the end of a mid-season loan to La Liga’s Villarreal. But Buchanan’s goal and two assists on Saturday had him turning a corner.\n“I feel like my old self,” Buchanan said postgame.\nCanada’s coaches like how Buchanan played in more of a right midfield role with Villarreal as opposed to the right wingback role he occupied with Inter Milan. They want him to occupy more central areas of the pitch and be more connected to the team’s forwards. That way, Canada believes he can be more effective in transition.\nSo what does that mean for Buchanan’s immediate club future? It’s worth wondering if the positional versatility he’ll gain from a strong Gold Cup this summer could make him more valuable to Inter. Could newly-appointed Inter manager Cristian Chivu sense Buchanan’s versatility and try him in different positions as opposed to right wingback to make him fit? Chivu’s recent history working with and developing younger players in Italy could help Buchanan’s case in Milan.\nAdvertisement\n“When the time comes at the end of the season, I guess that’s when I’ll reflect,” Buchanan told The Athletic in March of his club future.\nThat time is now, and it certainly feels like the hyper-determined Buchanan could return to Inter to fight for his place next season.\nLuc De Fougerolles, 19, center back, Fulham\nAfter a remarkable second start for Canada in which De Fougerolles commanded play in the back against Ukraine, things could soon turn at the club level for the uber-intelligent teenager.\nDe Fougerolles is out of contract with Fulham come July 1. It’s believed Fulham has expressed genuine interest in re-signing him. But is a return to Fulham – and possibly the Under-21 side – the best path for a player who looks more than ready for regular first-team minutes?\nThat’s the priority for De Fougerolles right now: Getting into a senior environment ahead of the World Cup.\n“I need first-team football,” De Fougerolles said declaratively. “I’d like a loan. I think I can obviously push for it to play first-team minutes. Obviously if Fulham want me around, I’ll gladly stay and be around the team. But a loan would be amazing. So just to play 40 professional games a season, I feel like that’s part of the game that maybe I’m missing. With the Under-21s, it’s less competitive. So if I were to go to a League One or a Championship team, I think every game would be competitive and that would give me something that I haven’t had much of, and I think that experience would really put me in a good space.”\nWhile De Fougerolles mentioned two English leagues, don’t be surprised if he considers top-tier options outside of Europe’s biggest leagues. A move to a team that develops young players is starting to feel more likely, with options in Belgium, the Netherlands or Austria as possibilities.\nAdvertisement\nNiko Sigur, 21, right back/right midfield, Hajduk Split\nAfter becoming a frequent starter in a variety of positions for Hajduk Split at just 21, it sounds like Sigur and his camp are pushing more than ever for opportunities outside of Croatia. A team in the Netherlands or Belgium that plays in European competitions makes sense. Increasing his understanding of how different European teams play ahead of the World Cup is a priority.\n“Honestly, I think it’s more down to what the club wants,” Sigur said of a possible move. “I have a contract (through) 2028, so there’s been a little bit of communication, but I think it was clear that when I come back from the Gold Cup, we’re going to come to a decision. And obviously there needs to be concrete offers and offers that make sense for me to go. Obviously, with World Cup coming up, I want to be playing. And I’ve been in Hajduk three years now. So I know I am well respected there. I’m going to be one of the more senior players, if that’s even possible. I’m only 21, but a lot of guys are going to move on, and it’s a really young team.”\nCyle Larin, 30, forward, Mallorca\nAfter a strong first half to the season in La Liga, the longtime Canadian forward cooled. Larin scored just two goals in his final 16 La Liga appearances this season. Despite having a contract until 2028, Larin sounds ready for a different opportunity.\n“I would love to stay in Spain and play at the top level. I’ve done well there. I played well with Valladolid. It’s just about finding a team that fits my style. When I played with Valladolid (on loan in 2023), we created chances. When I get chances, I can score. But when you don’t get chances, it’s harder to score,” Larin told The Athletic.\nAs things stand, Larin’s spot as a starter at the 2026 World Cup doesn’t feel assured. He knows from experience that he needs regular playing time to be at his most effective.\n“Leading up to (the 2022 World Cup), I wasn’t playing so much. It was very difficult. I had to put in more work to play and my fitness wasn’t there. I played a big role when I played in the World Cup 2022 in Qatar, but I could feel my fitness a little bit,” he said.\nWhile Larin wants to stay in Spain, would he consider a mid-season move to MLS? The Brampton-born striker, who starred at Orlando City before bolting for Europe, might not be at that stage just yet, but he would consider it.\n“If the option was there and the time was right, I would have to evaluate it,” he said.\nAdvertisement\nTani Oluwaseyi, 25, forward, Minnesota United\nOluwaseyi is in the middle of his best professional season: he has eight goals in just 16 MLS appearances. Marsch and the Canada coaching staff remain high on Oluwaseyi and his ability to execute their pressing demands while still creating opportunities.\nOthers are seeing Oluwaseyi elevate his play, too: it’s believed there are clubs in France, Belgium and the English Championship currently monitoring him. Still, the probability of a move this summer feels low, at least for now.\n“There’s enough to think about at Minnesota. There’s a lot to do at Minnesota, so I think my focus is just there for the most part,” Oluwaseyi said.\nOluwaseyi is instead a candidate to turn a few memorable performances at the World Cup into a move in 2026.\n“I’d be lying if I said as a player I didn’t want to challenge myself,” Oluwaseyi said. “I feel like Minnesota or MLS has been a pretty good challenge. And another challenge comes along that, that is the right one for me, and I’ll definitely be up for it.”\nJamie Knight-Lebel, 20, center back, Bristol City\nThe emerging defender is under contract with Bristol City until 2027. After spending last season on loan with Crewe Alexandra in England’s fourth tier, Knight-Lebel will not look for another loan this summer.\nExpect him to push for a regular spot with Bristol City and try to play as many Championship games as possible. Knight-Lebel’s inclusion in every Canada squad since October suggests he’s in the mix for a World Cup spot. Not just fighting for, but getting games at Bristol City could fortify that spot.\n(Top photo: Captive Camera/Cover Images/AP Images)",
