  "body_text": "Newcastle have reportedly turned their attention to former Manchester United forward Anthony Elanga after Bryan Mbeumo snubbed them in favour of a blockbuster move to Old Trafford.\nNewcastle had pinpointed Mbeumo as their top choice for the right-wing position, but the player chose to join United instead, despite the club’s lack of European football.\nUnited recently lodged a bid worth £45 million plus £10 million in potential add-ons for Mbeumo. Brentford rejected this opening offer but talks remain ongoing to try and reach a compromise. There is confidence that a deal will eventually get over the line.\nThe Red Devils are believed to be preparing a second bid for the Cameroonian as they look to secure his signature as fast as possible.\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Newcastle have now switched focus to Elanga after suffering a major transfer blow from United.\nElanga has enjoyed an impressive rise in his career since parting ways with the Red Devils in the summer of 2023.\nHe enjoyed a brilliant 2024/25 season, contributing six goals and 11 assists as he helped Nottingham Forest finish in seventh place and qualify for the Europa Conference League.\nHowever, the Carrington academy graduate could find himself playing Champions League football next season, as Newcastle have reportedly “made an enquiry” to Forest about a potential transfer.\nThe Mail note, “While discussions are at an early stage, the Magpies are now pursuing a move for the 23-year-old winger.”\n“Sources say Forest would demand a sizeable fee for the Sweden international – who has three years to run on his contract – if he indicated he wanted to go.”\nNewcastle manager Eddie Howe is said to be a strong admirer of Elanga, having missed out on signing him last summer.\nForest value Elanga at more than £50m.\nIt’s worth noting that United included a sell-on clause in the deal that sent Elanga to Forest, meaning they’re set to earn a decent sum if his move to Tyneside goes through.\nFeatured image Alex Pantling via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
