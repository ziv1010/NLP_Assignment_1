Meanwhile, TEAMtalk reported back in August that West Ham were also keen on his services.\nThe 21-year-old striker has been in sensational form this season, scoring 19 goals and providing three assists in 28 games for the Europa League outfit.\nHis scintillating form has not gone unnoticed, with Roma keeping a close watch on the forward for the last six months and getting a first-hand look at his qualities in a clash with Midtjylland on Thursday night.\nHowever, it appears that Tottenham may have thrown a spanner in the works of Roma’s efforts to seal a deal for Dju in the January window, if the reports from Italy are accurate.\nDON’T MISS ➡️ Transfer Debrief: Man Utd target says YES to move; Tottenham plot £145m double deal; Leeds manager hunt ignites\nWhy Tottenham have to sign Ivan Toney instead\nIt’s all well and good Tottenham being linked with the likes of Aghehowa and Dju, but scoring goals for fun in Portugal and Denmark is a far cry from producing on a regular basis in the Premier League.\nVlahovic could be a different proposition where he to sign, having had significant success in Italy and the Champions League, but Toney should be the player Spurs are all in on.\nThe connection with Thomas Frank speaks for itself, but Toney is a proven scorer in English football and arguably in the peak of his powers – even if he has been playing in the Saudi Pro League since the summer of 2024.\nIn 61 games for Al Ahli, Toney has netted 41 goals and hardly missed any game time with injuries, something that cannot be said of Tottenham’s current No.9 options.\nTEAMtalk has reported how Tottenham and Everton have both been keeping tabs on Toney, with the north London outfit having had direct contact via Frank.\nOur transfer correspondent Fraser Fletcher revealed on November 19 that Toney would be willing to take a pay cut of around 50 per cent to join a a Prem club this winter.\nKey to his desire to come back is the fact that he wants to fight his way back into Thomas Tuchel’s England squad ahead of the World Cup next year.\nHowever, Al Ahli will take some convincing to offload a player who has been so prolific and fired them to title glory last season.\nGet the inside story first by joining our TEAMtalk Facebook channel to receive the latest breaking and exclusive news straight into your Messenger inbox.\nLatest Tottenham news: Elite centre-back chase; Simons’ struggles exposed\nFirst up, Tottenham will reportedly look to fix their current defensive issues by sporting director Fabio Paratici visiting familiar hunting ground and landing an elite Brazilian defender, with TEAMtalk assessing how the move could galvanise skipper Cristian Romero into finding his best form again.\nElsewhere, Manchester City hope for Savinho to become one of the Premier League’s best-ever Brazilian stars, but TEAMtalk sources suggest he could yet become the subject of further transfer speculation involving Tottenham in 2026.\nAnd finally, as Xavi Simons continues to struggle for Tottenham, a reliable French source has revealed what the attacking midfielder privately thinks about his situation, with Spurs manager Thomas Frank’s tactics to be partly blamed.",
