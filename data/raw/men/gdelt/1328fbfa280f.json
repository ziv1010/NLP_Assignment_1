  "body_text": "Manchester United have stepped up their pursuit of Atalanta midfielder Ederson as they look to beat Manchester City and Juventus to his signature, according to reports in Italy.\nEderson has established himself as one of Serie A’s best midfielders since joining Atalanta from Salernitana in 2022.\nThe Brazilian has four goals in 33 league appearances this season but is firmly on the radar of several top clubs heading into the summer window.\nManchester City have long been linked with Ederson as they look to beef up their options in midfield.\nJuventus, meanwhile, are also plotting another bid for the 25-year-old having failed with their attempt in January.\nHowever, Tuttosport reports that United are still very much in the race to sign Ederson and have ‘increased contact’ with Atalanta regarding a potential deal.\nThe Red Devils have already sent scouts out to watch the midfielder in action as they seek to improve Ruben Amorim’s options in the middle of the park.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nThe report adds that United would be willing to pay between €55million-€60m (£46m-£50m) for Ederson, a figure that Juventus may be unable to match.\nHowever, a move for Ederson may well be predicated upon United securing a return to the Champions League by winning this season’s Europa League.\nSpeaking last year, Ederson admitted that he would be ‘curious’ about one day playing in the Premier League.\nMore Trending\n‘I like Italy, I’m well adapted, but I’m curious about the Premier League, so I don’t know,’ he told AS.\n‘I’m still growing, so I don’t know if I’ll stay in Italy, I think I still have more to prove. If I go somewhere else, then too. I will continue to grow.’\nElsewhere, United are also looking for attacking reinforcements and have begun talks with Wolves forward Matheus Cunha, who has a £62.5m release clause.\nThe Red Devils are also expected to try and complete a deal for Liam Delap after his £30m release clause was activated following Ipswich Town’s relegation back to the Championship.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Athletic Bilbao without 17-goal star for Man Utd clash with injury blow confirmed\nMORE: Paul Parker argues Man Utd may end up having a better season than Arsenal\nMORE: Man Utd agree deal to sign French wonderkid on free transfer",
