Ended after defeat by Derby County - their seventh in 14 Championship games.\nOnly Manchester City's Pep Guardiola has stayed at one club longer, across the top four divisions, than the 54-year-old former Manchester United striker managed with the Sky Blues in his second stint.\nBut, despite four Wembley trips, two promotions, a trophy win, and an FA Cup semi-final few will ever forget, Coventry owner Doug King has opted to go in a new direction.\nBBC Sport looks at the reaction to the decision to get rid of a man the club described as \"one of the club's greatest ever managers\".\nCoventry sack longest-serving EFL boss Robins\n- Published7 November 2024\n'Sickened' - Coventry fans react to Robins sacking\n- Published7 November 2024\nA 'poor decision'\nLegendary former Coventry City goalkeeper Steve Ogrizovic played more than 500 times for the club and was part of their 1987 FA Cup winning team.\nOgrizovic, who now works as a pundit for BBC CWR, said: \"Very few things in football shock me but this is a poor decision.\n\"It's not a knee-jerk decision because I think this is planned and Doug King has got a plan in the back of his mind, although what that is I don't know.\"\nDespite a slow start to the season for the third campaign in a row, wins against Luton Town and, impressively, at Middlesbrough, seemed to give Robins a bit of breathing space.\nBut Wednesday's 2-1 defeat by the Rams was one too far for King.\n\"Mark Robins had more to give, look at the club since the day he came in and it's been year-on-year success and progression,\" added 67-year-old Ogrizovic.\n\"The sun has been shining on Coventry and they got back into the Championship and along the way there were some great memories for people.\n\"The stadium is full now and it wasn't when Mark Robins first came to the club.\"\nRobins brought 'glorious light' to Coventry\nAnother former Sky Blues player David Prutton has paid tribute to what Robins achieved against the backdrop of financial constraints and the prospect of dragging the club back up from the bottom tier of the EFL.\n\"When I played for Coventry they were dark days so what Mark Robins gave back to that football club was just glorious light and illumination,\" Prutton, who had a brief loan spell at the club in 2014, told BBC CWR.\n\"He's got the same demeanour win, lose or draw which enables a team to climb the mountains they did.\n\"The fact he outperformed budget and expectations year on year is another feather in his cap.\"\nKey to that was getting the very best out of the squad and Prutton cites the work Robins did with striker Viktor Gyokeres - now one of the hottest properties in Europe thanks to his Champions League hat-trick against Manchester City.\n\"He bought him for about £1m and sold him for £24m, so he's ticked so many boxes, on the pitch for the fans to watch, enjoy and love, and off the pitch for the bean counters who want to make the football club a viable financial asset,\" Prutton added.\n\"We can all get into metrics and statistics but if anyone classes Mark Robins' tenure as a failure I would say that suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of what football means to people who love the game and are passionate about their club.\"\nSky Blues have sacked 'modern-day Jimmy Hill'\nLifelong Coventry supporter and BBC CWR sports editor Rob Gurney has pretty much seen it all in his time covering and following the club.\nHe says Robins leaving has once again illustrated the contrasting emotions being a fan and a journalist often present.\n\"Am I gutted? Of course. Am I surprised? Not in the least,\" he said.\n\"Football doesn't respect a manager's history or reputation, but you could argue Mark Robins was a special case.\n\"Yes, he left once, under a cloud. But, since his return in March 2017, he's pulled the club back from the brink.\n\"Winning the EFL Trophy within weeks of his return, instantly endeared him to Sky Blues fans again.\n\"An immediate return from League Two, after another memorable Wembley trip, cemented that relationship still further.\n\"Then we saw the League One title secured during Covid, were a missed penalty kick away from the Premier League, and most gut-wrenchingly of all, a toe-nail killed the greatest FA Cup comeback ever.\n\"Championship form tailed off, completely understandably, after the physical and mental exertions of that semi-final.\"\nGurney added that the timing of that hangover was unfortunate, given the club's pronounced public relations strategy coming into this season.\n\"Then a very aggressive summer marketing campaign 'Think Big, Aim High' fuelled expectations of a promotion push, but a slow start, for the third season running, sealed Robins' fate.\n\"My perception is the back-to-back wins over Luton and Middlesbrough came as a huge inconvenience to owner/chairman Doug King, particularly the supporters' response to Robins personally, in the face of going 2-0 down in the first of those.\n\"His, and his players, in-game management, has been scrutinised in recent weeks, although he'd appeared to have bought himself a little more time.\n\"Now King has made the decision to dispense with the man many fans regard as the modern-day Jimmy Hill, his next one could define the City's destiny for years to come.\"\n'Madness', 'gutted', 'devastated' - fans' reaction\nAs with any manager departure, the decision has triggered a frenzy of reaction from the club's supporters.\nDave called sacking Robins \"madness\" and wondered \"who is out there that can realistically do a better job\".\nAnother fan, Chris described his mood as \"absolutely devastated\" adding \"what a man he has been for the football club. It just doesn’t make sense\".\n\"Mark thank you for everything you have done, us fans hold you in higher regard than our apparent owner. Gutted\"\nThe club's mini recovery pre-Derby left Jesmondos thinking Robins had earned more time: \"Wow, really? That man worked wonders. Coventry fans would know best but surely he deserved a bit more time and trust?\"\nAnother supporter Jamie said he thought the club's search for a replacement \"head coach\" was a potential sign why Robins' time is over.\n\"Sounds like there was a touch of some internal politics in this move, with the club statement saying their next appointment will be a 'head coach' rather than a 'manager',\" he said.\n\"Coventry haven’t started this season well, but not sure it was bad enough to justify sacking their greatest manager of the 21st century.\"\nThe last thought goes to G-Man - who perhaps perfectly sums up the fickleness of football: \"The saviour that nearly knocks Utd out of the cup one minute, to no longer viewed as up to the job.\n\"Football - bloody hell.\"",
