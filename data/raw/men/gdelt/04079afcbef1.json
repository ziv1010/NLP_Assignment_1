  "body_text": "Former Manchester United striker, Giuseppe Rossi, has made the sensational claim that Roy Keane should be the next manager of the club.\nThe former Italian striker was briefly a teammate of Keane’s at United, as he played for the club between 2004 and 2007.\nUnited have had a tough season as they exited the Champions League, and European football as a whole, before Christmas and sixth place currently looks the best they can finish in the league.\nThere is the glimmer of hope of an FA Cup final next month to look forward but it is against the juggernaut that is Manchester City.\nAs a result of the poor season, Erik ten Hag’s future as manager has been the subject of hot debate for the media and pundits alike.\nMany believe that the Dutchman’s days are numbered as coach regardless of what happens in the FA Cup final but Rossi’s opinion is rather unique in who he claims should take over the role.\nSpeaking to DAZN he claimed, “when I think about potentially having Roy Keane as manager at Old Trafford, that sounds like it could be really great”.\n“It would be something very cool. The club should definitely think about it if they have a change in management. A man who is a legend of the club and helped build their culture, that’s exactly what is needed”.\nThe New Jersey born former striker claimed that the Irishman could help instil a better culture and understanding of what it means to play for United.\n“Maybe some of the players that are not playing for the shirt would understand it more. Maybe you need someone to go into Manchester United and clean the house so to speak and build from there. It could be a great situation”.\nThe Cork native’s last job in management was back in 2011 when he was boss of Ipswich Town.\nKeane has been involved with coaching more recently with spells at Aston Villa and the Republic of Ireland national team.\nHe has been recently linked to a return to management as Sunderland boss and of the country he used to represent.\nNonetheless, the former United skipper is more well-known as a pundit these days and has hardly been the biggest fan of Erik ten Hag or his former side’s work as of late.\nRecently after the Red Devil’s chaotic, error-strewn victory over Coventry City in the FA Cup he branded the current playing squad as “hard to like”.\nIn addition, he also pondered whether Erik ten Hag had been enjoying a couple of glasses of wine before his post-match press conference against Liverpool due to a disagreement in analysis of the game.\nWhilst Rossi’s prediction is fanciful at best, a Keane regime at United would certainly create some fireworks.\nWant to be the first to hear breaking Man United news?
