It´s so complicated, but I hope we can make it easier by winning.”\nIn the return fixture on matchday one, PSG´s campaign got off to a flyer when Kylian Mbappe and Achraf Hakimi goals ensured a 2-0 win, giving them a better head-to-head record with the Germans should both sides finish the group level on points.\nSince then, they have been up-and-down and a humiliating 4-1 away defeat to Newcastle and a 2-1 loss at Milan were backed up by a 1-1 draw on matchday five against the English outfit.\nAlthough already assured of their place, the onus is still on Dortmund to avoid defeat if they wish to ensure top spot and a better draw for the next round. “We want to get first spot and avoid the crazy good teams. We don´t want to go out in the round of 16,” said Dortmund defender Mats Hummels.\nIn the group´s other game, Newcastle´s first Champions League appearance in 20 years could end early when they host seven-times winners Milan, with both sides on five points and needing victory to have any hope of qualifying.\nFail to win and PSG will seriously risk bowing out of Europe´s premier competition at the first hurdle, that is what is immediately at stake for coach Luis Enrique and his team.\nSince Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) took over PSG in 2011, the club has never failed to qualify from the group stages of the Champions League, reaching the semi-finals in 2021 and the final the year before. Back-to-back exits in the round of 16 the last two campaigns, in part, cost coaches Mauricio Pochettino and Christophe Galtier their jobs.\nAnd an even earlier exit this term could be enough to convince PSG´s hierarchy that 2015 Champions League-winning coach Luis Enrique is surplus to requirements at the Parc des Princes, after a mixed start to life in Paris for the Spaniard.\nIt is a love/hate relationship that PSG have with the Champions League. The club desires it above all other titles and, so far, it is the only one to elude them since QSI´s takeover.\nStar signings, both on the pitch and in the dugout, such as Lionel Messi, Neymar, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Carlo Ancelotti and Thomas Tuchel, were brought in for a sole objective that ultimately remains unfulfilled.\nAnd painful defeats against Barcelona in 2017, Manchester United in 2019, Real Madrid in 2022 and in the final against Bayern Munich have traumatised the club and its fans.\nIt is the worst kept secret in football that Real Madrid want the France captain, though so far PSG have managed to hold onto their star asset. Another Champions League heartbreak could change this.\n-\nKate Middleton Proves She's True 'children's Princess' With THIS Move\n-\nPaul Anka Reveals How He Raised Son Ethan Differently From His Daughters\n-\n'A Very Special Visitor' Meets Queen Camilla At Clarence House\n-\nJodie Turner Smith Shares One Strict Rule She Follows As A Mom\n-\nHailey Bieber Reveals KEY To Balancing Motherhood With Career\n-\nPhoto Of Jay-Z, Other Prominent Figures With Jeffrey Epstein Proven To Be Fake\n-\nHillary Clinton's Munich Train Video Sparks Conspiracy Theories\n-\nFans Slam Talk Show Host For 'cringe' Behavior In Chris Hemsworth Interview\n-\nWoman Jailed Over False 'crime In Space' Claim Against NASA Astronaut\n-\nJames Van Der Beek’s Close Pal Reveals Family's Dire Need Of Donations\n-\nPrince William And Harry's Cousins Attend 'Wuthering Heights' Event\n-\nHailey Bieber Turns Heads Just Hours After Major Business Win\n-\nKing Charles' Andrew Decision Labelled 'long Overdue'\n-\nTimothee Chalamet 'forever Indebted' To Fan Over Kind Gesture\n-\nColumbia University Sacks Staff Over Epstein Partner's ‘backdoor’ Admission\n-\nOzzy Osbourne's Family Struggles Behind Closed Doors",
