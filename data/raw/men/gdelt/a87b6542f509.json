  "body_text": "Timo Werner confident he can make big impact under Ange Postecoglou at Tottenham\nBy Simon Peach, PA Chief Football Writer\nFormer Chelsea forward Timo Werner believes he can make a big impact under Ange Postecoglou at Tottenham without being “the main man” scoring goals.\nMuch was expected of the Germany international when he completed a £53million switch to Stamford Bridge in 2020 after scoring goals aplenty at RB Leipzig.\nBut the pacy forward failed to transfer his German scoring feats into the Premier League and returned to his former club for just £25m after two seasons in west London.\nA post shared by Tottenham Hotspur (@spursofficial)\nThe 27-year-old is back in English football after joining Spurs on loan – with Son Heung-min at the Asian Cup – and provided an assist on his debut in Sunday’s 2-2 draw at Manchester United.\n“We wanted to win the three points, that’s the only not-so-good thing but we did a very good game,” Werner, whose six-month loan includes an option to make the deal permanent, said.\n“It’s not easy to win at Old Trafford and yeah I’m very pleased with my game.\n“I enjoyed it out there and with the assist, it was a very good debut for Spurs.”\nAsked whether supporters saw the best of him at Chelsea, the Germany international said: “That’s hard to say. There was always criticism of my game there.\n“At the beginning I also started like I did here, from the left side.\n“I think a lot of people wanted to see me scoring more goals, but at Spurs, with the tactics we have and the way the manager wants me to play, I can bring a lot to the group, also with my assists and maybe (by) not being the main man who scores the goals.\n“To make deep runs to create space for the others and like today, to create an assist.”\nWerner’s work on the left allowed Rodrigo Bentancur to make it 2-2 at Old Trafford, where Spurs twice came from behind and should perhaps have left with more than a point.\nIt was a promising debut from a player that scored 23 goals in 89 appearances for Chelsea and helped win the Champions League in 2021.\n“Maybe sometimes it’s not about the fans or the manager,” Werner said when asked if criticism of his time at Stamford Bridge was unfair.\n“Sometimes it’s about you, how you are getting things together, how you look at your stats and think, ‘I wanted to score more goals’.\nA post shared by Timo Werner (@timowerner)\n“I think now I’m a bit older, I see how important assists and deep runs are for the team.\n“I also want to score goals but it’s not the main part of my game anymore. I can bring so much more especially in this kind of tactic for the group.”\nRicharlison and Bentancur were the goalscorers for Postecoglou’s side on Sunday, cancelling out goals from Rasmus Hojlund and Marcus Rashford.\nHojlund’s thumping opener got United off to a dream start inside three minutes, but Erik ten Hag’s side lost their way in what will be their only Premier League match this month.\n“We were talking in the break about switching off, so it was a little bit annoying (to concede so quickly),” Hojlund said, referring to Bentancur’s strike within a minute of the second half getting under way.\n“We need to take the positives with us, again we need to be disappointed, as two times we were ahead.\n“It can happen but again I think we played a great game.”",
