Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette were both signed ahead of him – and in 2022, he had the opportunity to leave on a free transfer.\nKnowing that he might not be Mikel Arteta's first-choice striker, Nketiah signed a new contract regardless, telling FFT that a huge part of the decision was made by his heart.\n\"It was just my love for the club,\" he says now. \"London’s home, the club is home, but I’ve been an Arsenal fan all my life and that played a big part.\n\"Talking to the manager and the plans he had for me, and the fact he needed me… I knew I wanted to learn, develop and help this club.\"\nVIDEO: How Arsenal FINALLY Beat Manchester City At Their Own Game\nNketiah was born in Lewisham and has been a Gooner all his life – even as a youngster in the Chelsea academy, where he was released alongside Declan Rice – who he's now team-mates with in the Gunners side.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nNot only is it a lifetime goal for him to play Champions League football, Nketiah says that out of any club he's excited to see in the competition… it's his own.\n\"I’m buzzing to be involved in the Champions League – I’ve never played at the Bernabeu so that would be an experience…\" he says.\n\"But I just want to hear that theme tune at the Emirates. I know what the fans are feeling, and what it means to be part of Arsenal.\"\nMore Arsenal stories\nDeclan Rice has exclusively revealed to FourFourTwo why he chose to sign for Arsenal this summer.\nFFT also caught up with former Arsenal star Aaron Ramsey, who explained why he turned down a move to the Saudi Pro League in favour of re-joining Cardiff City.\nMeanwhile, Aaron Ramsdale has been labelled 'f*cking weird' by one of his ex-Gunners teammates.\nMark White is the Digital Content Editor at FourFourTwo.
