Sign up to receive it directly to your inbox.\nHello! Jose Mourinho loves to be the star of the stage, especially in the Champions League. But it was the Trubin Show in Portugal last night.\nComing up:\n😮 Benfica keeper’s stunning goal\n🆚 PSG, Madrid, Inter in play-offs\n🤔 What now for Rodriguez?\n👋 Hammers’ cold Paqueta farewell\nAdvertisement\nHead Master: Keeper Trubin rescues Benfica, Real Madrid dumped into play-offs\nBenfica’s staff massed on the touchline, as if they sensed what was coming. Jose Mourinho waved his goalkeeper into attack. There were seconds left and the club were out of the Champions League, unless a goal could save them at the last.\nWe’d waited patiently for bona fide European theatre — months, in fact, because of a Champions League format which delays do-or-die action until matchday eight — but here it was. Benfica’s Fredrik Aursnes swung a free kick into the box. Mourinho’s ‘keeper, Anatoliy Trubin, got on the end of it. His glancing header was perfect, bouncing past Thibaut Courtois, and Benfica rolled a six.\nNeedless to say, Trubin, 24, had never scored in his entire career. If you pushed me, I’d bet my life savings (such as they are — I’m not worth robbing) on him never scoring again. Benfica were beating Real Madrid anyway, 3-2 to the good, but without the Ukrainian’s genius finish, they would have missed the play-offs on goal difference. The funny thing? Just before he scored, Trubin appeared to be senselessly wasting time, his own fans giving him the bird.\nThese are the moments when the Champions League hooks you. Seasons can hang on a clean touch of the ball. Marseille and Tim Weah thought they were in the hat, despite a 3-0 defeat to Club Brugge. One goalscoring cameo from Trubin on 98 minutes and Marseille were toast. None of us saw it coming, except perhaps the Greatest Showman. Because when Mourinho’s in town, all bets are off.\nSporting late show causes chaos\nThe league stage is over and Benfica are in good company in the play-offs. Extremely good company. Over in Spain, another goal in added time — this one from Sporting CP’s Alisson Santos — shook up the established order and put some of Europe’s best in their place.\nAdvertisement\nSporting’s 3-2 win at Athletic Club drove them into the last 16 automatically. That, along with Tottenham Hotspur finishing in the top eight (why can’t they get it together like this in the Premier League?) was the surprise of the league stage. When Art de Roche talked up Sporting’s Casio watch wearing-coach, Rui Borges, yesterday, he wasn’t paying him lip service.\nThe consequence of their form is that holders Paris Saint-Germain are reduced to a play-off spot. So too Madrid and Serie A leaders Inter — three of last season’s four semi-finalists, in fact. The draw takes place tomorrow and the fact that it’s seeded will keep those clubs apart but they would rather be where Arsenal, Barcelona, Liverpool and Manchester City are: safely ensconced in the round of 16.\nChelsea burst into the top eight too after a fine win in Naples, where Joao Pedro seemed to bury everything he hit. Napoli were duly eliminated, giving this year’s competition one victim of note at least. Frantic though last night became, the set-up of the Champions League still leaves you thinking that it’s more of an achievement to go out at this point than it is to progress.\nICYMI\nBefore we move on, here’s a couple of things you might have missed from the mad slew of 18 ties.\nThe USMNT’s Malik Tillman notched twice as Bayer Leverkusen locked down a play-off slot by beating Villarreal 3-0. His first owed everything to Villarreal keeper Arnau Tenas, whose touch and attempted clearance was some of the doziest play you’ll see all season:\nBut no such complaints about Slavia Prague’s Jindrich Stanek, who was left without a prayer in the face of a 30-yard stunner from Pafos' Vlad Dragomir. A man with eight arms wouldn’t have stopped this:\nThe last word, though, goes to Norway’s Bodo/Glimt. They nipped into 23rd place by upsetting City and Atletico Madrid in the space of nine days — having not kicked a ball in anger since December 10. Nobody deserved the luck of this pinball winner against Atletico more. Your man at the bottom of the clip couldn’t quite believe it...\nNews round-up\n- Greek club PAOK are coming to terms with a grim tragedy after seven of their fans were killed en route to their Europa League tie at Lyon this evening. They died when the minibus they were travelling in collided with a truck in Romania.\n- A Chelsea fan was hospitalised before their win at Napoli. Friends of his told The Athletic that he’d been stabbed in the leg with a screwdriver. The club confirmed one supporter had sustained non-life-threatening injuries.\n- The Premier League and Major League Soccer are leading the push for football’s rule-makers to allow temporary concussion replacements. It’s seen as a step towards better player welfare.\n- In transfer land, Crystal Palace are poised to commit to a £45m fee for Wolverhampton Wanderers’ Jorgen Stand Larsen, Fulham have negotiated terms for Manchester City’s Oscar Bobb, Nottingham Forest want goalkeeper Jose Sa from Wolves, and Douglas Luiz is officially an Aston Villa player.\n- Inter Miami are, for some reason, desperate to get themselves into South America’s Copa Libertadores. The president of South American governing body CONMEBOL, Alejandro Dominguez, says he would happily let MLS and Liga MX teams participate. Is anything sacred?\n- The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has read the riot act in the wake of the chaos at the Africa Cup of Nations final. Senegal coach Pape Thiaw is starting a five-game ban. Fines of over $1m have been issued. Morocco’s demand for the result to be overturned was dismissed, however.\nLost Souls: Fading stars Rodriguez and Sterling without clubs\nIt isn’t hard to think of a time when James Rodriguez and Raheem Sterling were having their fun in the Champions League (Rodriguez won it twice with Madrid; Sterling made the final with Manchester City in 2021). It isn’t hard to think of a time when their international careers were flourishing, either.\nAdvertisement\nSterling turned out for England at the last World Cup, and Rodriguez will go to this summer’s with Colombia. They’re not washed by any stretch, but as it stands today, both are clubless. Two players who were once highly coveted find themselves managing the uncertainty of free agency.\nChelsea and Sterling had been going their separate ways for ages. He last appeared for them in 2024 and yesterday, he and the club finally agreed to sever his contract by mutual consent. We’ll wait to see where he tips up next — because it’s inconceivable that finding a new employer won’t mean taking a meaningful wage reduction.\nAs for Rodriguez, he’s 34 and he’s been dotting nomadically from team to team for a while, the latest was Leon in Mexico. His deal there ran out late last year and since then, he’s been at a loose end. The midfielder is so integral to Colombia that he’ll make the World Cup one way or the other (that yellow shirt brings the old magic out of him) — but it won’t help their prospects if he shows up covered in dust.\nAround TAFC\n- This week’s Alternative Premier League Table is one of my favourites so far: points gained from a losing position and points dropped from a winning position. Villa know how to turn a game around. Bournemouth need to shore things up.\n- Here’s a win for Canada and head coach Jesse Marsch: Marcelo Flores is set to switch allegiance to them from Mexico (after many, many years of speculation about his international future). Now to see if he can bed in effectively in time for the World Cup.\n- The inaugural FIFA Women’s Champions Cup final will pit SC Corinthians against Arsenal this weekend. Corinthians scored a shock by knocking out NJ/NY Gotham in London yesterday. There’s a $2.3m prize fund at stake.\n- Most clicked in Wednesday’s TAFC: the World Cup boycott debate.\nCatch a match\n(Selected games, times ET/UK)\nUEFA Europa League (all 3pm/8pm and TNT Sports in UK): Aston Villa vs Red Bull Salzburg — CBS, Paramount+, Fubo, ViX; Celtic vs Utrecht ; Maccabi Tel Aviv vs Bologna; Nottingham Forest vs Ferencvaros — all Paramount+, ViX; Lyon vs PAOK; Porto vs Rangers; Real Betis vs Feyenoord — all Paramount+, DAZN.\nAnd finally...\nAs anticipated, Lucas Paqueta is leaving West Ham United. The club don’t want him to go but the 28-year-old is insisting, so a £35.8m ($48.9m) switch to Flamengo in Brazil is pending.\nYou won’t need me to remind you that much of Paqueta’s time in London was consumed by betting allegations against him — allegations he was cleared of. In pre-empting his exit last night, West Ham said they “would like to take this opportunity to thank our management, players, staff and loyal supporters for the unwavering and devoted support they have shown to Lucas throughout his time at the club and, in particular, over the past two-and-a-half years”.\nIn other words, thanking everybody except Paqueta himself.
