  "body_text": "Celtic target Marko Tilio, born 23 August 2001, currently plays as a forward for Melbourne City and the Australia national team. Tilio was born in Hurstville, a suburb in Southern Sydney, and began playing club football at the age of six.\nHe transitioned through several clubs during his childhood before finally earning an opportunity to play for his hometown club, Sydney FC.\nAt Sydney FC, Tilio signed his first professional contract in September 2018 and made his NPL senior debut in March 2019.\nDuring his time at Sydney FC, he scored 11 goals and was awarded the FYL Golden Boot. He made his professional debut in the AFC Champions League in May 2019, and later that year, he was promoted to the senior squad.\nThe Australian scored on his A-League debut in February 2020, helping Sydney FC to secure a win over Central Coast Mariners. After making 6 appearances and scoring 1 goal, Tilio departed Sydney FC in September 2020 to seek better playing time.\nTilio then signed a three-year contract with Melbourne City, where he made his debut in January 2021. He scored his first goal for the club in April 2021 in his eighth appearance. During his time at Melbourne City, Tilio has been part of three A-League Premiership title wins.\nInternationally, Tilio began his career with the Young Socceroos in 2019 and scored a hat trick in his first international game against the Vietnam U-20s. He also scored his first goal for the Olyroos in a 2–0 win against Argentina after coming on as a substitute. He was named in Australia’s squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nCeltic have reportedly had a bid accepted for Tilio by Melbourne City [Record Sport] . Tilio, who has 10 goals in 31 games, is highly rated and has been tipped to become one of Australia’s international stars of the future. He has already won three A-League Premiership titles and was named in the PFA A-League team of the season.\nIn terms of squad composition, the interest in Marco Tilio from Celtic could potentially indicate that the club is preparing for various scenarios, such as a player leaving, or simply adding depth to the squad.\nCeltic’s current wingers, Liel Abada and Jota, have been performing well, with Abada predominantly playing on the right and Jota being more versatile but often more effective on the left.\nJota has been one of Celtic’s standout performers, and his performances may attract interest from other clubs. Similarly, Abada has made a positive impact since joining Celtic, and the club may anticipate interest in him as well.\nTilio’s addition could provide additional depth and versatility to Celtic’s attacking options.\nHowever, it’s also important to remember that interest in a player doesn’t necessarily mean that another player is set to leave.\nAs of now, there’s no concrete information suggesting that either Abada or Jota is expected to leave Celtic. The club’s interest in Tilio could just be a sign of their desire to strengthen their squad and ensure they have ample cover and competition for places.",
