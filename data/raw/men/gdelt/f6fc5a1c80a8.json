Iraola is widely viewed as one of the most promising up-and-coming coaches. At Rayo Vallecano he gained promotion from the Segunda Division then achieved outstanding La Liga results including regular wins over Barcelona and Real Madrid despite having very little money to spend.\nAdvertisement\nSigning Iraola on a two-year contract can be seen as a coup for the Cherries; and another sign of the allure of the Premier League, where all the most ambitious and talented coaches now want to pit their wits against each other.\nThere is even some dismay that he is headed for a relatively small club like Bournemouth, when in the past bigger Spanish outfits such as Sevilla, Valencia or Villarreal might have been very happy to have him at this point in his career.\nBut there is also excitement to see how Iraola gets on facing the best coaching minds in world football, including some who he knows very, very well.\nAfter making 510 appearances for Athletic Bilbao and then finishing his playing career at New York City in MLS, Iraola began in management with Cypriot side AEK Larnaca, then returned to Spain and took Segunda Division side Mirandes to the Copa del Rey semi-finals.\nAfter joining Rayo in the summer of 2020, he guided them to promotion at the first attempt via the play-offs. They had a superb first half of the 2021-22 Primera Division campaign, and although a run to the Copa semi-finals took a toll on their league form, they still finished 12th.\nThat first season included a 1-0 victory over Barcelona in what turned out to be Ronald Koeman’s last game as Blaugrana coach. They then went to the Camp Nou and beat Xavi’s Barca 1-0 late in the campaign. The 2022-23 campaign saw them beat Barca and Real Madrid at their Estadio de Vallecas and challenge for European qualification right until the end of the season.\nAll this while operating on a shoestring budget — the archaic Vallecas is the second smallest stadium in the Primera Division, and their La Liga salary limit is 16th of the 20 sides. While most coaches might complain about these restrictions, Iraola turned it to his advantage. Without a host of expensive new arrivals, he instead focused on detailed, long-term tactical work, ensuring individuals got to know his ideas and each others’ strengths and weaknesses.\nAdvertisement\nThe starting XI which beat La Liga and Champions League holders Madrid last November contained eight players who had achieved promotion from Segunda during the 2020-21 campaign. The additions were right-back Ivan Balliu (a free transfer from Almeria), centre-back Florian Lejeune (on loan from Alaves) and young forward Sergio Camello (on loan from Atletico Madrid).\nThese same players also beat this year’s soon-to-be La Liga champions Barcelona 2-1 in April, meaning Iraola’s Rayo took 10 points from their four games against the Catalans over the last two seasons, while conceding just one goal.\nGetting such results with a core of players who had very little prior experience in the top flight was a fantastic coaching achievement. Iraola worked on them individually and collectively, so that they complemented each other and grew to know their roles on and off the ball inside out.\nPreviously unheralded players such as right-sided midfielder Isi Palazon (28), left winger Alvaro Garcia (30), defender Alejandro Catena (28), and midfielders Santi Comesana (26) and Oscar Valentin (28) all progressed together and become well-established Primera players.\nThe data shows a sustained upward trajectory of Iraola’s Rayo and his clear and cohesive gameplan.\nWe can see from this graph of their pressing intensity over the last two seasons that Rayo have been on a pretty steady upward trajectory in terms of PPDA (pass per defensive action) since they were promoted to La Liga.\nPPDA measures how many passes the opposition makes before making a defensive action, so we can see how active a team is in looking to win the ball back. Iraola’s side started off slightly passive in August 2021 but, as confidence has grown along with tactical familiarity, they have become an incredibly aggressive team, to the point where Iraola’s Rayo won possession in the final third more than any other side in Europe’s top five leagues last season.\nAnd once they had regained the ball, they also had a clear idea of what to do with it.\n68 – Across the big five European leagues in 2022-23, only Bayern Munich (73) forced more high turnovers that produced a shot than Andoni Iraola's Rayo Vallecano (68).\n73 – Bayern\n68 – Rayo Vallecano\n67 – Brighton\n63 – Napoli\n62 – Arsenal, PSGHunted. pic.twitter.com/yusUoCEddb\n— OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) June 19, 2023\nSuch intense, front-foot defending and speedy, efficient transition play are also a trademark of Marcelo Bielsa, who once instructed Iraola to bomb down the line himself when they were together at Athletic from 2011-13.\nAdvertisement\nAnother distinctive feature of Rayo’s game under Iraola is a desire to find the wings as much as possible, particularly the left, where lightning-quick Fran Garcia gallops forward in support of the equally rapid Alvaro Garcia.\nFran Garcia’s progress under Iraola was such that Madrid activated a clause to buy him back this summer, after Bayer Leverkusen (coached by another up-and-coming young Basque coach in Xabi Alonso) showed interest in signing the 23-year-old.\nRayo’s attacks were often launched quickly, primarily through the spearing passes of centre-back Catena, the outfielder who attempted (and completed) the most long balls in the Primera division last season.\nCatena was under instruction from Iraola to stretch the pitch vertically, to open the space for creators Isi and Oscar Trejo to receive the ball and then build attacks deep in opposition territory.\n“We like to play into space, with the deep runs from Alvaro or Camello, not in the centre-forward position,” the coach explained to Spanish sports website Relevo. “We look to get behind the rival and that way gives players in intermediate areas space to work. If Alvaro or Camello don’t make those runs for the whole game, maybe Trejo and Isi would not have space to receive the ball. We know that, moving the ball from one side to another, we can find spaces inside but we find it more difficult to understand it deeply. Cate and Florian give us this.”\nAn initial look at the Bournemouth squad suggests Marcos Senesi is suited to taking on this role. Senesi ranked toward the top of Premier League’s centre-backs for long diagonals attempted (54; 15th) and completed (31; 14th) in 2022-23, as well as the share of his pass attempts that were long diagonals (4.2 per cent; 11th).\nThis is not to suggest Iraola’s Rayo were a ‘long-ball’ team who just get it forward and fight for second balls, as the graphic below shows. They ranked third in La Liga for PPDA, eighth for long pass share and 12th for attack speed. They ended the season with possession of 50.9 per cent and Field Tilt of 54.2 per cent, showing how the team with very few stars was able to collectively hold their own and play in their opposition half.\nThat the team could develop together and progress to this point was especially impressive as Rayo had so little money to spend, and Iraola not much control over how it was spent. During his three seasons in charge, the club had a net outlay over the three years of about €12million.\nAdvertisement\nMost of that (€8 million) was spent in summer 2022 on striker Raul de Tomas, who was the choice of club president Raul Martin Presa, but did not fit with Iraola’s tactical requirements.\nPresa is an eccentric figure whose time in charge has seen tremendous turmoil, including the players going on strike in protest at club staff being laid off in May 2020 during the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic. That fit with the historical connection between Rayo’s team and their fans from the working-class barrio of Vallecas, which Basque ‘blow-in’ Iraola also identified with and respected in his own understated way.\nRayo were still in contention for UEFA competition qualification in the last weeks of the La Liga season, although their relatively small squad and limited budget explained a fall in the final few weeks down to 11th spot.\nThat slightly underwhelming end to 2022-23 was also understandable given that it had been clear from some months back that Iraola was unlikely to renew his contract, having realistically taken the club as far as possible. Other key players, including Catena and Comesana, are also moving on.\nIraola also knew that he was sure to have plenty of offers to choose from. His standing in Spain was such that he could have had his pick of most La Liga clubs.\nThere were reports that he was lined up to take over as Sevilla’s next permanent manager, which he denied after their interim coach Jose Luis Mendilibar had such an impact that the Andalusians ended the season as the Europa League winners. It is also relevant that both Basque coaches, Iraola and Mendilibar, are represented by the same agency.\nVillarreal were also interested, especially when the team wobbled under Quique Setien in spring, but a late surge to ensure Europa League qualification kept Setien in the job. Celta Vigo and Almeria would have both loved to appoint Iraola, but he had better offers than attempting to over-achieve with another mid-size Primera Division club.\nAdvertisement\nThe Premier League is now seen as the primary destination for all ambitious Spanish coaches — as seen when Unai Emery left Villarreal for Aston Villa last season. Iraola also could have left Rayo mid-season to take over at Leeds in February, with the Bielsa link important, but he decided the timing was not right. Then, when Leeds were relegated, dropping down to the Championship became less attractive.\nThere were even reports that the Spanish federation had considered Iraola as an option had national team boss Luis de la Fuente not shored up his position with Sunday’s Nations League final win over Croatia.\nIt may just be coincidence that Monday then saw Bournemouth decide to fire O’Neil and hire Iraola. Quite incredibly, the Premier League now has four coaches from the small Basque province of Guipuzcoa: Iraola, Emery, Julen Lopetegui and Mikel Arteta. Even more amazingly, Iraola first met Arteta when they both played for San Sebastian-based youth side Antiguoko in the late 1990s, so their Premier League meeting when Bournemouth face Arsenal in September should be special for both men.\nIraola is maybe the most low-profile of this bunch. In public he is still quietly spoken, respectful and even sometimes wary of the spotlight. How his methodical approach transfers to the pressure-cooker Premier League, and how he does against his Basque peers in such distinguished surroundings, is going to be fascinating to watch.\nThe evidence from seeing Iraola thrive in plenty of different environments — amid the Basque-only ethos at Athletic Bilbao, with the international City Football Group in New York, on a shoestring in Segunda at Mirandes, and then at the chaotic Rayo — suggests he can get results wherever he goes.\nThe Premier League’s financial strength will be something new, and brings its own challenges, internally and externally. Bournemouth may not be one of England’s biggest spenders, and Iraola may or may not have much say in choosing players, given the statement announcing his arrival said a number of targets are already identified.\nHowever, he has shown he can work very well with what he has given, and can take on and beat teams with much bigger stars and deeper budgets. He has earned the chance to join his Basque peers in the Premier League, and it will be fascinating to see how it works out.\n(Top photo: Fran Santiago via Getty Images)",
