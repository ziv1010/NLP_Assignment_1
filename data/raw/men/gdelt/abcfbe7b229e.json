  "body_text": "The Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid should have been one of last year’s great sporting showpieces — a meeting between two of European football’s aristocrats, in one of Europe’s grandest venues, in one of its finest cities, for arguably club football’s greatest prize.\nInstead, the day turned into a nightmare for thousands of supporters.\nAdvertisement\nThere were chaotic scenes as fans tried to enter Paris’ Stade de France, with a failed ticketing system and security operation resulting in dangerous crushes around the ground. Many innocent supporters were tear-gassed by police simply for being in the vicinity. After the match, meanwhile, hundreds of fans were subjected to random attacks by local gangs as they attempted to make their way back from the stadium to local transport hubs or hotels.\nUEFA’s report into the trouble has now been published but what has been the legacy for those who endured those terrifying events of May 28, 2022?\nThe Athletic spoke to fans of both Liverpool and Real Madrid. These are their stories.\nDanny Smith: ‘A guy pretended to be a peacemaker. Then he hit me with a hammer’\nThe scars on Danny Smith’s left leg provide a permanent reminder of the night his life changed forever in Paris.\nSmith, a season-ticket holder on Anfield’s Kop, was the victim of a brutal attack outside the Stade de France moments after Liverpool’s 1-0 defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League final last May. His knee was left shattered by a hammer as local youths rummaged through his pockets and stole his possessions in front of his traumatised teenage son, Daniel.\nOn his return to Merseyside, Smith spent nine weeks in hospital and underwent two major operations. Intensive physio has helped him walk again but he remains in constant pain and hasn’t been able to work since.\nSpeaking publicly about his ordeal for the first time, the 47-year-old told The Athletic how a dream trip turned into a nightmare.\n“We were dead lucky to get tickets in the ballot. It was an amazing feeling,” Smith says. “I felt like I’d let my lad down not being in a position to take him to the finals in Kyiv or Madrid, so this was the perfect opportunity to make amends.\nAdvertisement\n“We flew to Nantes via Dublin and had a night there before getting the train to Paris the day before the final. The kids were all wearing their colours. The build-up with Jamie Webster in the fan park was brilliant — just like a European Cup final should be.”\nThe mood changed dramatically, however, as they approached the Stade de France.\n“We got off the metro at Saint-Denis about four hours before kick-off and then we walked to the bottom, by the motorway where fans were being funnelled in,” he says. “Police vans there made a narrow opening even narrower. It took us two hours just to get a couple of hundred metres.\n“It started getting worse and worse. The police were just standing there with their rifles. The kids were getting frightened. Finally, we got through and you think, ‘That’s the worst of it over’. Little did we know that was just the beginning.\n“We started bumping into people we knew who had been mugged already. My initial thought was, ‘Let’s just get inside’. But no one was being allowed into the stadium.\n“We stood there for ages. A crush ensued and I froze. I was at Hillsborough as a 14-year-old. I didn’t know what to do. A young lad from the Wirral said, ‘Give me him’ and put Daniel on his shoulders. If it wasn’t for him, I don’t know what would have happened to Daniel. I’m still wracked by guilt about that.”\nYet this was just the start of the ordeal.\n“We got a bit closer as they started to let people in but then the police started tear-gassing people. Everyone around us had tickets. It was just horrible seeing so many people in distress. I can remember hardly anything about the game. I’ve never watched it back and I don’t intend to.”\nAfter the final whistle, a friend who was there with his two teenage sons suggested they should all walk back to the metro via the Real Madrid end. Their thinking was that it would be quieter at that end of the stadium, given the majority of the Spanish contingent were still celebrating victory inside the stadium.\nAdvertisement\n“We were only just outside the stadium when we became aware that we were being followed,” Smith says. “About 10 of them in their early twenties were whistling and it was clear they wanted trouble. Then there was an ambush. About 50 came from different directions. A couple of them went to grab my bag. Daniel was trying to pull me one way, but I was worried about turning my back on these lads.\n“Then another guy came alongside me pretending to be a bit of a peacemaker. I think it was him that hit me with the hammer. I just felt this agony in my leg and went down. I guess that’s his signature thing to incapacitate someone. They knew they had me where they wanted me and I couldn’t do a thing about it. I kept trying to get up but my knee kept giving way.\n“I was sitting up when another lad came running at me to kick me in the head. Thankfully, it just skimmed my face. Within seconds, my bag with my money in had gone, as well as my sunglasses, bracelet, and the watch the kids had bought me.\n“Daniel was shouting, he was terrified. Then they picked me up again, pretending to help. As soon as they did, hands went in every pocket taking everything else I had. Thank God, I’d left our passports at the hotel. When they realised I had nothing left they just dropped me on the ground in agony.\n“For them, it was just on to the next one. My mate got hit over the head with a crash helmet. His two sons were attacked and robbed as well.”\nGO DEEPER\n'I really thought I was going to die': The Liverpool-supporting children tear-gassed and terrorised in Paris\nAmid such savageness, there were also acts of bravery and compassion.\n“This Liverpool fan, Joe, from down south, came up to me and said, ‘You can’t stay here, Mate. I’m not leaving you’,” Smith says. “He could have just put his head down and kept walking for his own safety, but he chose not to.\n“There were two policemen standing there. Joe tried to alert them to what had happened to me but they didn’t want to know. They just shrugged and said, ‘This is Saint-Denis’, as if it’s just to be expected.\nAdvertisement\n“Joe got me up and I put my arms around his and Daniel’s shoulders. There was a Novotel a bit further down and how they got me there, I don’t know. He lay me down on the floor inside. People thought I’d been stabbed. A few minutes later the security at the hotel had to barricade the doors because there was a massive mob outside, trying to get in.”\nWith no ambulances available, Smith was told he would have to make his own way to hospital. His priority was getting his son back to Merseyside safely so rather than seek medical treatment for his shattered leg, he embarked on the journey home, via a train to Nantes, around 250 miles (400km) away.\n“My mates got, like, a trolley for me to sit on. When we got to Nantes airport, paramedics looked at my knee and said, ‘You aren’t going to be able to fly’. But I explained about my son and how it was only an hour’s flight and I promised that I’d go straight to hospital when I got to Liverpool. They got a wheelchair and a ramp and let me fly. The pain was insane.”\nSmith went to Liverpool’s Royal Hospital, where X-rays revealed he had suffered three tibial plateau fractures — breaks in the upper part of the tibia (the larger bone in the lower leg) that involves the knee joint. He was transferred to Aintree University Hospital for surgery the following day.\n“They couldn’t believe that I’d made it home like that. They rate knee injuries out of six in terms of severity and they said mine was a six. They basically had to rebuild my knee. I had about 15 pins and plates put in it.\n“Then I had another operation a few weeks later. One of the nurses told me it was the longest leg operation they had done there — around seven hours. They opened it up and described my knee as like a box of Lego, bits everywhere. They said I was close to losing my leg. It was August before I got out.”\nThe love and support of son Daniel, 14, and daughter Holly, 18, gave him strength and his spirits were also raised by a surprise visit in hospital from Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher. Friends and family rallied round with fundraising efforts and Liverpool as a club have provided vital help.\nAdvertisement\n“What a lad Carra is. He will never know how much that meant to me. It gave me a huge lift,” Smith says. “I’ve been so lucky with the support network around me. The wider Liverpool family have done so much. The club have been fantastic and Spirit Of Shankly (the supporters’ union) too. They were here 10am the morning after I got out of hospital.\n“Friends set up an online page for donations and they had a match at City Of Liverpool (the non-League club) to help me pay my bills so I don’t have to worry about a roof over my head. I hate to think where I’d be without all that kindness.\n“That’s meant I’ve been able to put everything into my rehab. The club kindly sorted out the physio for me and I can’t thank them enough.”\nThree times a week, Smith goes to Rehab 4 Performance, a facility in the Speke district of the city founded by former Liverpool physio Matt Konopinski and current club physio Chris Morgan. He has made remarkable progress but nine months on, he still hasn’t returned to his job for car-seat production company Adient and is receiving statutory sick pay of just £99.35 per week.\nHis claim for compensation over what happened in Paris is in the hands of a legal firm, with French police yet to provide the crime reference number that’s been requested.\n“From being in a wheelchair to being on crutches to one crutch and then walking again, the feeling that I’m moving forward has been really important for me, mentally,” he says. “My work have been really supportive and we’re now talking about a phased return, possibly starting in March. I definitely wouldn’t have worked again but for Matt at Rehab 4 Performance. I don’t think I’ve ever been more dedicated to anything in my life. I don’t want to let anyone down. I’ve got so many people in my corner rooting for me.”\nSmith is waiting for a date for a third operation on his leg and has been told that, further down the line, he will need a full knee replacement. But what about the mental scars from that night?\nAdvertisement\n“I haven’t been back to a game since but that’s not a mental thing, I just don’t want to do anything that could jeopardise my recovery,” he says. “I was worried about Daniel. A few weeks after the final, we chatted about what had happened. He said, ‘You’re still going to come to the Community Shield, aren’t you?’. I said, ‘No’, and he goes, ‘Well, how am I going to get there?’. That was the moment I knew he was OK.\n“I was in the Leppings Lane end at Hillsborough and Paris triggered a lot of memories for a lot of people. We’ll see the effects of Paris for a long time yet. I’m sure things will come up for me. I’ll get some counselling when the time comes.\n“I might have had one of the worst injuries but my story is nowhere near as bad as some of the stories I’ve heard. I’ve had people come here to see me crying. One lad I know from the match was with his young son in an underground car park after the game and they had machetes pulled on them.\n“I’m hoping I might be able to go back to Anfield towards the end of this season, but I’ll never return to Paris. Daniel asked me to promise him that. I’m just so glad no one died. It was a miracle, really.”\nAmid that relief, there is still anger when it comes to assessing those Smith considers responsible for the chaos in France.\n“UEFA has to be responsible for ensuring people can get in and out of a Champions League final safely,” he says. “They have to ensure the policing and the stewarding is right. How could they get it so wrong?”\nJimmy Whelan: ‘I go to home games but away in Europe? That’s it for me now’\n“It makes me feel ill just thinking about it,” says Jimmy Whelan. “I was at Heysel and I was at Hillsborough, two terrible tragedies, but Paris was the first time following Liverpool I actually feared for my life. It still preys on my mind.”\nAdvertisement\nWhelan is a 65-year-old roofer who lives in the Allerton area of Liverpool. He has witnessed all six of the club’s European Cup/Champions League final triumphs and flew to Paris last May with friends and family, including son James and grandsons James and Zane, in the hope of seeing a seventh.\n“There was a big group of us and we had a great time earlier on the day of the final. The sun was shining and everyone was in good spirits,” he recalls. “Everything changed when we made our way towards the stadium. We got stuck in that underpass with all the build-up of people. Having been at Hillsborough, something told me we should go back and go around to the other end, the Real Madrid end.\n“When we got to the turnstiles, I had to stay outside to hand a ticket over to a mate who had been having a horrendous time in the queues.\n“Next minute, people start running towards me saying, ‘They’ve shut all the gates’. It was mayhem. Local kids were climbing up railings to bunk in, while the police were tear-gassing fans who were waiting with tickets to enter and were being crushed. I spoke to another old fella who was in tears. He had a ticket but said he wasn’t going inside after what he’d been through.”\nWith Liverpool trailing 1-0 late on, Whelan decided he had seen enough and headed for the exits to make his way back into the centre of Paris. “We were never going to score that night,” he says.\nThe events that followed directly outside the stadium will be ingrained in his memory forever.\n“I was scared coming out of that ground. Gangs of youths were running wild, throwing punches, lads were having their keks (trousers) ripped off them, watches, phones and wallets stolen. Horrible b*******.\n“I felt helpless. I wish I could have done more to help people but I’m nearly 66. One fella tried to grab me and I just ran. I saw a taxi and dived into it. Three Irish lads asked if they could share it and they got in too.\nAdvertisement\n“Thankfully, my son and grandkids went out the ground a different way. They had more safety in numbers with the group they were with. They had Paddy Pimblett (the UFC fighter) with them. I was shell-shocked by the things I witnessed that night. I still am.”\nWhelan vowed in the aftermath of Paris that he would never travel away in Europe again and nine months on, he has stuck to that pledge.\n“I still go to all the home games but that’s it for me,” he says. “I was in Rome in ’77 to see us lift the European Cup for the first time and I’ve been everywhere since. I was one of the lucky ones at Hillsborough as I managed to get into the stand rather than behind the goal.\n“As football fans, you get used to being treated badly. But in all those years, Paris was the worst experience I’ve ever had at a game. It was all down to UEFA. They don’t give a s***. The organisation of that final was a joke.”\nRagnhild Lund Ansnes: ‘They sent us into pure hell’\nFor Ragnhild Lund Ansnes, football has never quite been the same since that day.\n“Paris put me off going to European away games — I’ve not been to one since,” says Ansnes, a Liverpool-based Norwegian author and broadcaster. “I’ve got no trust in UEFA. Paris took away all the joy. I’ve never been so scared in my life.”\nAnsnes travelled to the French capital last May with her son Elias, 16, and 13-year-old daughter Elvira. It was a third Champions League final following Liverpool in the space of five seasons for her and Elias. According to Ansnes, those two games had been “two of the highlights of our lives”, landmark occasions with “no issues whatsoever”. Paris. however, was very different.\n“It was just a nightmare,” she tells The Athletic. “It was supposed to be Elvira’s first Champions League final but in the end, we couldn’t get a ticket for her, so she stayed at the hotel. That was destiny. If she had gone through what we went through that night, she would never want to step foot inside a football ground again.”\nAdvertisement\nThe day had actually started well. The family had spent a pleasant afternoon in the Paris fan park with Bruce Grobbelaar, the former Liverpool goalkeeper, and his wife Janne, who are family friends.\nThat joy, however, turned to frustration and then fear outside the Stade de France.\n“Gate A was completely shut and we didn’t move for an hour. It was getting more and more uncomfortable. There was no information. It was a shambles,” Ansnes recalls. “We thought we were missing the game because there was no announcement outside about the kick-off being delayed. Then someone said they had opened Gate C, so we headed round there. There were lots of local kids hanging around, trying to rip tickets out of people’s hands in front of the police.\n“When we finally made it inside, they didn’t even scan our tickets — they just marked them with a pen. The gate itself was such a blur. There wasn’t the singing and the buzz you’d usually associate with a game that big.”\nWorse was to follow after the final whistle as they tried to make their way back to their hotel nearby.\n“We wanted to go under the flyover, alongside the motorway, but the police forced us onto the bridge,” she says. “They sent us into pure hell. Suddenly, there was a mob coming at us from behind and at the end, there was another mob waiting for us. Fans were getting robbed and beaten. People were stabbed — wallets, passports and phones stolen. There was nowhere to escape.\n“We were fortunate that Bruce was with us as he stayed calm, pulled us to the side and protected us from the worst of it. It was so frightening. It all happened so quickly.\n“It was an horrific experience, as a mother, seeing your teenage son terrified like that. When we finally got into the reception area of the hotel, we were shaking.\n“I’ve been to cities all over Europe following Liverpool where there are rows of police providing protection outside grounds. What angers me the most is that in Paris, the police sent us into that trouble. It was like a war zone. Their only response was to tear-gas everyone. It was a miracle no one died.”\nAs devastating as the day itself proved to be, its legacy has proved just as destructive.\nAdvertisement\nElias has not asked to go to an away European game since and his mum has been forced to reappraise her attitude:\n“When you go to a football game and you end up fearing for your life and your children’s lives, it makes you reassess things. I’ve never felt as unsafe as I did that night. For Bruce, it brought back a lot of the trauma from being at Heysel and Hillsborough.\n“I’m still angry at UEFA and the French authorities. They should be ashamed. All that nonsense they said about fans turning up late or thousands turning up without tickets.\n“Why did they select a venue for the final that was so unsuitable? There are serious issues in that area in the north of Paris. Why was the policing and stewarding so bad before and after the game? People should be held accountable for what peaceful fans had to endure.”\nThe Real Madrid fans’ experience: ‘It was a lawless city’\nThe chaos that engulfed the 2022 Champions League final may have predominantly affected Liverpool supporters, whose access route to the Stade de France was palpably unfit for purpose, but Real Madrid fans — around 20,000 of whom had tickets for the game — also suffered.\nThe experience of Francisco Morales Bravo de Laguna, president of the Real Madrid supporters’ association in Wales’ capital Cardiff, was typical of many. He had travelled to Paris as part of a group of five — four adults and one child — and after an afternoon at the fan zone allocated to the Spanish club, began to make his way to the stadium.\nIt was there that he first began hearing troubling stories of what had happened around Paris that day.\n“When we were on our way to the first security checkpoint we found young girls crying who had been robbed of their tickets,” he tells The Athletic. “Then people were pushing and shoving each other and trying to force their way in. They were jumping the last fence and running until they got lost inside the stadium — four or five guys did it. At the time we said, ‘What s****y security’, but we hadn’t realised the magnitude of the issue yet.”\nAdvertisement\nMarcos Blanco, a Real Madrid member for 30 years who has been to six Champions League finals, had similar misgivings after seeing how local criminals had targeted supporters who had been corralled into queues to gain access through the stadium security checkpoints.\n“It was an absolute disaster,” Blanco says. “The thieves had everything under control, where the car parks were, the fan zone. Then, outside the stadium, as they were going to put up screens to watch the match, it was full of people and these crooks were taking advantage of the fact that everyone was crowded against the fences.\n“At the first security ring, there were already a lot of people there and, as most of them were using electronic tickets, when they were about to take them out, those who wanted to get in took photos of the mobile phones of the fans with tickets. That’s when I realised what was going on.”\nOther fans had sensed danger far earlier in the day.\nJose Acero, a Madrid-based supporter, had travelled to Paris by van with three friends, taking a circuitous route that also took in San Sebastian, and the French cities of Bordeaux and Orleans.\nAfter parking at a hospital adjacent to the stadium, the group made their way into the city centre and noticed a palpable edge to the mood on the streets. “The atmosphere was weird — we wrapped our jerseys around our watches so people couldn’t see them,” he said. “You could tell it wasn’t a safe place.”\nMadrid fans’ route to the stadium was less chaotic than the one their Liverpool counterparts took, and many were unaware of the issues that had plagued their rivals until they actually entered the ground and noticed that while the Madrid end was largely full, the Liverpool area was pockmarked by empty seats, hence the delayed kick-off.\nThe sight of their club claiming a 14th European Cup/Champions League should have been the trigger for wild celebrations long into the evening, but any euphoria swiftly gave way to fear when Madrid supporters began to make their way out of the stadium.\nBlanco recalled seeing people swarming into the stadium once gates were opened, desperate to claim souvenirs but also creating dangerous bottlenecks, while once outside it was “chaos — people were running like in wildlife documentaries. We saw from a distance how a father and son were attacked. Three people went after them without the riot police doing anything in front of them”.\nAdvertisement\nSeeking safety in numbers, Blanco grouped together with other fans from Madrid’s supporters’ associations in New York and Los Angeles to ensure they were not targeted by local gangs, and De Laguna recalled seeing groups of locals waiting to pick off fans who became separated from the main mass of supporters.\nHis group of four adults formed a ring around the child who was with them to keep each other safe.\nMore on last summer’s chaos in Paris…\n- Explained: UEFA’s review into the Champions League final\n- Special report: ‘It was starting to crush. We were shaking’\nOthers were not so lucky.\n“Almost all our friends left by a different bridge than ours,” Acero said, “and as we were crossing, it looked like the movie From Dusk Till Dawn. We were walking because the van was not far away (less than a 20-minute walk) but then two groups of between eight and 10 thieves approached us and started chasing us.\n“We were lucky. because we found a cab and just jumped inside. The robbers were banging on the doors and the driver told us he couldn’t take us but we paid him €50 in cash and he drove us to our van.”\nThe ordeal was not quite over, yet. “When we got into the van, I realised that our window had been smashed. Fortunately, we didn’t have a lot of valuables, but we drove to our accommodation in Orleans at 1am, 100-odd kilometres away, with the window broken and freezing cold. It was a lawless city.”\nBoth De Laguna and Blanco had heard of similar tales from fans who had driven to Paris only to return to their vehicles to find windows smashed — there were even reports that thieves had stolen branded underpants from one caravan to sell on the black market.\nAll three are united in their outrage at the way fans were failed by the authorities, but Real Madrid themselves also come in for criticism for the way they handled supporters who had been mistreated.\n“By far, it was the worst (event) I have ever experienced in my life,” Blanco said, “but the club, as always, looks the other way. When the trouble started, they set up a website for us to make enquiries, but it was useless.\n“We were much luckier than the Liverpool fans, but I still never want to go back to Paris.”\n(Main graphic — photos: Getty Images/design: Sam Richardson)",
