Gungahlin United did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe clubs must beat out the likes of Sydney powers APIA Leichhardt and Sydney Olympic, and Victoria's Avondale FC and South Melbourne for a place in a competition ranging from 10-16 teams.\nMORE CANBERRA SPORT\n\"Our club is ready to step up and compete at a higher level of football,\" Canberra Croatia president Tony Vidovic said. \"We've always wanted to do that in our history. Whatever is available, we'll go for it.\n\"Football is in our DNA and there's been a lack of top-quality football in Canberra so we think we deserve to be there.\"\nA national second division has been on the agenda for years, with many clubs viewing it as the missing link between the A-League and the community game.\nThe project, however, has been held up by a host of issues, including finances, internal politics and COVID.\nFootball Australia finally started the process in February and hopes to have the league up and running for the 2024 season.\nThere are increasing concerns this is not a realistic time frame as the selection process drags on. Given it's now September, teams are running out of time to secure sponsors, recruit players and establish training programs before a March kickoff.\nInstead, some clubs involved in the process view 2025 as a more realistic start date.\nThe ultimate goal is to establish a second tier competition with promotion and relegation to the A-League, however Football Australia chief executive James Johnson revealed an alternate structure is on the cards in a statement during the week.\nRather than a traditional 10-team league, the organisation is considering a Champions League-style format featuring the top sides from the state and territory competitions.\nSuch an event has previously been held as a knockout tournament at the end of the respective National Premier Leagues seasons.\nWhile a traditional league is preferred, the alternate format would be simpler, cheaper and easier to implement at short notice.\n\"As we advance, our commitment is to the future of Australian football,\" Johnson said. \"Whether we finalise on the conventional league structure or adopt the 'Champions League' model, our vision remains clear - to elevate the stature of football in Australia.\"\nThe developments come on a stunning Sunday afternoon for Canberra Croatia's men and women's sides.\nStephen Domenici scored six goals to help the men secure a place in the finals with an 8-1 demolition of fierce rivals Canberra Olympic in the last game of the season. The teams will face off again in next week's semi-final.\nTatum Mazis scored in the 85th minute to salvage a point as the Croatia women drew 4-4 with West Canberra Wanderers.\nCapital Football round 21\nMen's NPL: Canberra Croatia 8 bt Canberra Olympic 1; Monaro 6 bt Tuggeranong United 2; O'Connor 3 bt Tigers FC 0; Gungahlin United 8 bt West Canberra Wanderers 0.\nWomen's NPL: Canberra Croatia 4 drew with West Canberra Wanderers 4; Belconnen United 2 bt ANU 0; Tuggeranong United 1 bt Canberra United Academy 0.\nWe've made it a whole lot easier for you to have your say.
