Trainer Rupea Lambert says the players are inspired, not intimidated, by the opportunity.\n“We are the first Tahitian team to participate in the OFC Women’s Champions League and we are very proud to be here. It’s not pressure — it’s motivation. The girls are eager to perform in front of their home crowd,” Lambert said.\nReigning champions Auckland United FC are entering the tournament in strong form. With seven league matches already under their belt this season, head coach Ben Bate believes his squad is better prepared than ever.\n“We’re much more mature in terms of our playing style. The players are in great condition. We’re especially looking forward to facing Hekari — they’re one of the top teams, and we welcome that challenge,” Bate stated.\nHekari United of Papua New Guinea — runners-up in the previous two editions — return with a mission to finally secure the title. Coach Ericsson Komeng believes his side has grown from past heartbreaks.\n“Finishing second twice has taught us a lot. We’ve gone undefeated in our domestic season since. Now we’re back, focused, and hungry to go one better,” said Komeng.\nSmaller Pacific nations are also stepping into the spotlight. Tupapa Maraerenga FC from the Cook Islands and PanSa FC from American Samoa are eager to punch above their weight.\nFor PanSa, team official Ati Faamau-Samuelu reflected on football’s deep cultural roots in her country.\n“Football is everything for our youth — even if they start on cement courts. PanSa is more than a team; it’s our family’s legacy. Our players may surprise many with their heart and fight,” she said.\nPanSa was established in 1997. “That’s when I started playing. If anybody asks what PanSa means, it’s my parents’ name. If you can see our logo, it has a Panamanian flag because our dad is Panamanian and my mum is Samoa,” Faamau-Samuelu said.\nTupapa’s coach Angela Wallbank emphasised national pride.\n“We’re not just playing for a club — we’re representing the Cook Islands. The team knows the weight of that responsibility,” she said.\nRepresenting Fiji, Ba Women’s FC is led by legendary figure Charlene Lockington, whose life in football dates back to 1979. For her, this tournament is the crowning moment of a storied career.\n“This is the pinnacle. I’ve played, coached, and lived football with my family since the late ’70s. Being here is a dream come true — for me and the generations of my family involved in the game,” she shared.\nHenderson Eels FC from the Solomon Islands arrive with star power in the form of Ileen Pegi, whose leadership and skill have been vital to the team’s unity and confidence.\n“Ileen lifts everyone. Her experience and energy inspire the squad — we’re here to compete as one, for each other,” said team manager Daisy Maneihioha.\nThe tournament kicks off on Sunday, local Tahiti time, with Henderson Eels FC playing Tupapa Maraerenga FC in the opening Group A match.\nContent Sourced from scoop.co.nz\nOriginal url",
