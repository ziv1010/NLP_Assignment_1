When I say transfer targets, I mean pretty much any player of note in English football in particular, everything is a long-term approach with Eddie Howe, transfer targets that he has aren’t sudden decisions. Anybody he signs, certainly from English football, he will have been well aware of for some time.\nThere are a lot of obvious reasons for buying players who already have Premier League experience, shown they can perform etc etc.\nThere are a lot of reasons for buying English players as well, they have grown up in this environment, mostly in Premier League set-ups, they are generally more naturally attuned to playing football in the English top tier, plus they hold their value better than players from overseas. Then of course if you get it right with younger English players you can really hit the jackpot in terms of increase in value, as quality English players will always carry a premium over and above overseas players of similar ability. You only have to look at the transfer fees that are generally paid for English players of any promise as compared to those from overseas, whilst of course there are other very credible factors, such as the number of homegrown players you need if playing in Europe.\nOf course, it isn’t just a case of buy English and/or Premier League players, it is about signing the right ones.\nAlso, buying them at the right price.\nEddie Howe managed to buy England internationals Nick Pope and Kieran Trippier for £10m and £12m respectively. That is just crazy, how did he do it?\nHis eye for a player is immense, ridiculed for the £13m he spent on a near 30 year old Dan Burn, yet Howe’s judgement on the big lad from Blyth has been spot on. What a signing and a key part of these last two and a half years.\nInvesting in young English players such as Hall, Livramento, Gordon, Kelly and Barnes, aged between 18 and 25 when signed, which other Premier League clubs are coming close to this?\nEddie Howe paid £13m for a then second tier 20 year old Lloyd Kelly, now he has managed to sign a Premier League regular 25 year old Lloyd Kelly on a free. This isn’t like the Mike Ashley frees, giving massive contracts to players not good enough, such as Fraser and Hendrick. My guess is when we see Kelly playing, a lot of Newcastle fans will be surprised by his quality. Eddie Howe has not signed him again just because he was free and to make up the numbers.\nAs I say, this approach to buying English and Premier League experienced players has been a massive success, largely because Eddie Howe knew exactly what he was buying, including those with much better to come, such as Gordon, Hall and Livramento when he bought them.\nWhen Eddie Howe has strayed to a different kind of signing, those who aren’t English and/or not already Premier League experienced, a bit of a different BUT yet the same approach.\nDifferent in terms of how much money spent BUT the same in terms of doing everything he can to ensure these are quality signings..\nBruno Guimaraes – Already a Brazil international and impressing for Lyon, including when playing in the Champions League, £41.65m paid out for Bruno.\nSven Botman – Brought in aged 22, having already won Ligue 1 with Lille and impressing in the Champions League, United signing him for £35m ahead of other European clubs including AC Milan.\nAlexander Isak – Aged only 22 when signed, having played Champions League and Europa League football, plenty of international football for Sweden, scored a lot of goals, with £63m invested.\nSandro Tonali – Aged 23 on signing, have already helped AC Milan to Serie A glory and then to the semi-finals of the Champions League. A sum of £55m paid out for the Italy international.\nEddie Howe not buying just anybody when straying from the English/Premier League market. In overseas markets where buying players is massively more prone to mistakes, even for the best managers, the NUFC boss going for real quality.\nBruno, Botman and Isak proving fantastic signings and now worth far more than what Newcastle United paid for them. Whilst with Sandro Tonali I am very confident he will prove the same, when getting the chance to redeem himself this coming season and future ones.\nI have no doubt he will join the list of Eddie Howe stellar signings.\nSigning Lloyd Kelly and Lewis Hall on permanent deals this summer, it looks like ever chance another promising young English prospect will join them, with widespread reports that an initial £16m bid for James Trafford will end up with NUFC landing him for £16m-£20m.\nThe Newcastle United transfer stategy under Eddie Howe is all too apparent AND it is working.\nIf trying to guess what will happen in the remainder of this summer transfer window and indeed future windows, I think it will be more of the same.\nYoung English talent, usually with Premier League experience, plus the odd expensive young high quality addition from overseas.\nThis Newcastle United squad is getting stronger and stronger with each transfer window, Eddie Howe building for the here and now as well as the future.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
