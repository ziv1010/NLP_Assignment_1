  "body_text": "Abdallah Sima has scored goals regularly in the Champions League and the Europa League — but he may never kick a ball for Brighton & Hove Albion.\nThe 23-year-old has made an impressive start to his fourth loan in as many seasons. Now at Brest in France, he is in elite company as the Champions League’s joint-second top goalscorer with three goals after the first two rounds of matches.\nAdvertisement\nAustrian opponents have been on the wrong end of Sima’s finishing in the revamped Champions League format. Sima scored for Brest, the French side that finished third in Ligue 1 last season behind Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco, in a 2-1 home win against Sturm Graz in September. He also struck twice in a 4-0 victory at Red Bull Salzburg this month.\nOnly Harry Kane, with four for Bayern Munich, has scored more goals in the competition proper so far. Sima is on par with Serhou Guirassy and Karim Adeyemi of Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko. So why is he not part of Brighton’s attacking plans?\nTo answer that question, it is instructive to consider what has happened both to Sima and to Brighton since he came to the club in August 2021. He was a typical signing for the club: a raw talent bought cheaply with the aim of turning him into a Premier League player or selling him on for a tidy profit.\nBrighton tracked him for a year at Slavia Prague, eventually making the move when the Czech club’s asking price dropped to a level they considered acceptable. They paid approximately £6million ($5.2m) for the unproven prospect who had only just turned 20 years of age and had only experienced one full season of senior football due to a rapid rise. Albeit he had scored 20 goals in 39 games for Slavia’s first team and reserves, including 11 in the Czech league and four in the Europa League.\nSlavia signed him in the summer of 2020 from FC Silon Taborsko in the Czech Republic’s second tier. A Czech scout took him to Taborsko, who specialise in giving chances to youngsters from abroad. The scout spotted his promise with French fifth-tier club Thonon Evian after they had taken him from amateur side FC Medina.\nSima is one of 10 children who lost their father at a young age. He was playing local football in the Senegalese capital of Dakar, where he was born, until he was 17 years old. He has turned into a versatile, 6ft 2in (188cm) striker with a lean physique, who can play as a No 9 or in wide positions, with an eye for goal.\nAdvertisement\nBut he has been set back by a susceptibility to injuries. This first surfaced at Stoke City in the Championship, where Sima was loaned to immediately after signing for Brighton. It was meant to be a season-long arrangement, but Brighton recalled him midway through the 2021-22 campaign after ankle, back and groin issues restricted him to four appearances.\nAlthough he speaks English, Sima’s main language is French. A loan to Angers in Ligue 1 for the 2022-23 season went as well as could be expected in the circumstances. He finished as the club’s top scorer with six goals (plus two assists) in 37 appearances as Angers went through three coaches (Gerald Baticle, Abdel Bouhazama, Alexandre Dujeux) on their way to finishing bottom of the table.\nSima’s injury problems returned in an otherwise successful 2023-24 season on loan to Rangers in Scotland. Hamstring injuries ruled him out for two months between January and March and for a further three weeks towards the end of the season.\nAnother hamstring problem means Sima could miss Brest’s Champions League fixture on Wednesday night against Bayer Leverkusen; last season’s Bundesliga champions also have a 100 per cent record after their first two matches in the competition.\nSima thrived at Rangers, scoring 16 goals in 39 games as they finished runners-up to Celtic in the Scottish Premiership, won the League Cup and reached the last 16 of the Europa League, losing 3-2 on aggregate to Benfica.\nTwo of his goals came in the Europa League, increasing his overall tally with Slavia and Rangers in Europe’s second-tier competition to seven in 17 appearances. Rangers made multiple bids to sign Sima permanently in the summer transfer window but none of them came anywhere near to being acceptable to Brighton.\nSo, Sima ended up back in France again, this time at Brest, essentially because Brighton’s development during the three years he has been on the books has outstripped the progress he has made across his series of loan spells.\nAdvertisement\nOver this period, Brighton have significantly strengthened their strikeforce by signing Georginio Rutter from Leeds (£40million) and Joao Pedro from Watford (£30m), as well as Paraguay forward Julio Enciso from Libertad (£9m). Danny Welbeck is still going strong at the age of 33. They also retain faith in Evan Ferguson, even though goals have dried up dramatically for the 20-year-old Republic of Ireland prospect.\nSima made a good impression on and off the pitch during Brighton’s pre-season tour to Japan under new head coach Fabian Hurzeler but he is not regarded as better than the strikers they already had in the building. That drove the decision to loan Sima out again, given that he was unlikely to get many minutes.\nIn recent years, Brighton have let some strikers leave who have flourished elsewhere — none more so than Viktor Gyokeres, the Sweden international who has scored 55 goals in 62 games for Sporting Lisbon. Gyokeres moved to Portugal from Coventry City in July 2023, having been sold by Brighton in July 2021.\nAnd then there’s also the case of Deniz Undav, who joined VfB Stuttgart on a permanent basis last summer after scoring 19 goals in all competitions during a loan spell there in 2023-24. He has also become a full Germany international.\nDespite the recent success of both strikers, Brighton have hardly been short of quality attacking options. And for context, the recruitment regime has changed since Gyokeres was an academy player at Brighton, while Undav was an experienced signing rather than a youngster.\nSima is under contract until 2026. Circumstances can change but the matter of where his future lies is likely to come to a head next summer — either via a sale or, if something changes with those ahead of him in the pecking order, he could yet emerge as an in-house replacement.\n(Top photos: Abdallah Sima and Viktor Gyokeres, pictured right; Getty Images)",
