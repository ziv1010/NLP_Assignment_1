  "body_text": "Rivers United have sealed qualification after defeating Mozambique’s Black Bulls 3–2 on aggregate, becoming the first club from Nigeria to reach the tournament’s group stage since Lobi Stars did so in the 2018/19 season.\nTheir success also underscores the early impact of Finidi George as manager, as Rivers United now prepare for the group stage draw on November 3, where they will face some of Africa’s top clubs.\nThe Bulls had edged Rivers United 1-0 in the first leg of the encounter in Maputo last week.\nThe Nigeria Premier Football League side turned the tie around with a 3-1 victory in the return leg, which was held at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium on Saturday.\nWasiu Falolu put Rivers ahead in the 15th minute with a brilliant finish, and just before halftime, Maclyn Biokpo added the second from the spot.\nBlack Bulls pulled one back after the break through Moctar Diallo to tie the encounter.\nHowever, Rivers clinched the win in the 75th minute, with Timothy Zachariah’s superb strike securing history for Finidi George and his team.\nRivers will know their opponents in the group stages of the CAF Champions League when the draw is held on November 3.\nRivers United’s progress marks a potential resurgence for Nigerian clubs in CAF competitions and raises expectations for strong performances in the group stage.",
