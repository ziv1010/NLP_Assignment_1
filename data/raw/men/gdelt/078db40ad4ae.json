A penalty was given, converted by Erling Haaland it proved the first goal of a 7-0 win.\nUEFA can give specific guidelines to referees in its own competitions but cannot change the fundamental Laws of the Game, a process managed by FIFA.\nThe inaugural Football Board - which includes Carlo Ancelotti, Jose Mourinho and Zinedine Zidane - met on Monday in Nyon, three weeks after UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin promised it would be created and review handball offences he said were increasingly confusing to players and fans.\nThe new grouping is led by Zvonimir Boban, the former Croatia and AC Milan great who previously worked at FIFA and is now a key adviser to Ceferin.\n\"The handball rule, for example, will always be disputed but we can make it more consistent and aligned with the game's true nature,\" Boban said.\nMonday's meeting also included national-team coaches Gareth Southgate, Ronald Koeman and Roberto Martinez, plus Philipp Lahm, the former Germany captain.\nAustralian Associated Press",
