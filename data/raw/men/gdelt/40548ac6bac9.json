Although Napoli went down 2-1 on aggregate, Osimhen was on target in the second leg, which ended 1-1. That made it 26 goals in 31 games this season for the Super Eagles top striker.\nWith the current price tag on Osimhen by Napoli put at £150m, the club is yet to open talks on a new deal with the Nigerian international, who has two years left on the contract he signed in September 2020 on his £70million arrival from Lille.\nThe delay, according to the tabloid, comes down to aggressive pursuit of the star by the Manchester United with the Italians not against the idea of cashing in now.\nAnd the fact Erik ten Hag and staff are still monitoring Osimhen’s form so closely indicates they view him as an authentic alternative to their top target Harry Kane this summer.\nUnited are expected to lead the chase for England and Tottenham all-time record goal-scorer Kane – should he refuse to extend his contract in N17 and force the North Londoners to sell rather than lose him on a free a year later.\nBut the Reds are wary that Spurs Chairman, Daniel Levy, could drag his heels on any transfer negotiations as he holds out for at least £100million.\nTen Hag’s need for a prolific world-class striker is clearer than ever after last week’s Europa League disaster and, whoever owns United come June, they will need to get the Dutchman one.\nKane may guarantee goals galore but, at 31, he is entering the twilight of his career. That makes Osimhen, who will cost a similar amount, a more attractive long-term investment.\nBut, at the same time, unlike in the hunt for Kane, the Old Trafford hierarchy face fierce competition from all their big rivals – home and abroad – for the African sensation. Which is why Champions League football next season is imperative for Ten Hag’s troops, whose only route left to qualify for Europe’s premier cup competition is via a top-four league finish.\nUnited still reeling from last week’s Europa League quarter-final thumping at Sevilla. However, the Carabao Cup winners were sitting fourth in the Premier League table coming into the weekend. They also survived a shoutout with Brighton to set up a Manchester Derby FA Cup final with City on June 3.",
