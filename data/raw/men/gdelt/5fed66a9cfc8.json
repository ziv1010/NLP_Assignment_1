Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nArsenal have been heavily linked with the Sweden international as they look to sign a new striker for Mikel Arteta, who is desperate for attacking reinforcements.\nThe Gunners failed to sign a new No. 9 last summer and had a bid for England’s Ollie Watkins rejected by Aston Villa in January.\nManchester United were thought to be leading the race for Gyokeres as Ruben Amorim looked to reunite with a player he worked with at Sporting.\nBut Gyokeres intends to play in Europe next season – something United will not be able to offer unless they win the Europa League and qualify for next season’s Champions League.\nWhich club should Viktor Gyokeres join?\nArsenal\nIt’s obvious why a move to the Emirates Stadium might appeal to Gyokeres. Arsenal look set for a third successive second-place finish in the Premier League and they have come so close to winning the title without an out-and-out striker.\nGyokeres would be an immediate upgrade on Mikel Arteta’s current options, which include ex-Chelsea forward Kai Havertz, the injured Gabriel Jesus and makeshift striker (at least since Arsenal’s injury crisis) Mikel Merino.\nMore than just a goalscorer – as 11 assists so far this season shows – Gyokeres would also thrive in an Arsenal team that requires more from their forwards than just a poacher.\nPlayers speak glowingly of Arteta and Arsenal would be a stable environment for Gyokeres to continue his development and perhaps be the difference for a team who have aspirations of winning trophies on the regular over the next few years.\nManchester United\nOld Trafford was immediately tipped as Gyokeres’ future destination when Ruben Amorim left Sporting Lisbon to replace Erik ten Hag.\nGyokeres’ incredible first season came under Amorim and the ex-Sporting boss looks set to welcome a new striker to the club this summer after being left underwhelmed by expensive but struggling signings Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee.\nThe chance to reunite with Amorim will be tempting for Gyokeres, who would also be joining one of the biggest clubs in the world despite their recent struggles.\nThe problem, of course, is Manchester United – in the bottom-half of the Premier League – will be without Champions League football next season, barring a surprising Europa League triumph.\nLiverpool\nGyokeres in on course to leave Sporting Lisbon as a title winner so who better to join than the new Premier League champions?\nLiverpool, on the verge of becoming English champions in Arne Slot’s first season at Anfield, could be the perfect platform for Gyokeres.\nSlot has managed without a recognised centre forward this season but Jamie Carragher is among those calling for the arrival of a new striker amid reports Darwin Nunez is on his way out.\nLiverpool could lose Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk this summer but winning the race to sign Gyokeres would be a significant coup and give Slot a reasonable chance of defending the title.\nLouis Sealey | Deputy Sports Editor, Metro\nMan Utd urged to beat Arsenal to Gyokeres\nEx-Manchester United winger Nani recently urged his former club to sign Gyokeres ahead of Arsenal and said he would ‘love’ the striker to arrive through the doors at Old Trafford.\n‘My last game of my career was against Sporting,’ he said. ‘We lost badly, it was incredible. After ten minutes we were losing 3-0.\n‘But the way they play, the striker they have, Gyokeres, it’s amazing. The way they played was amazing.\n‘He’s making goals, he’s making assists, so I think he’s a player who can play in the Premier League. Trust me.\n‘If he was playing the same today as he was one year ago I would say no because, in the Premier League, the defenders will eat him because he just wants to run with the ball.\n‘But now, he’s playing with his head and he’s really strong. It felt like he was a rock! Powerful. I swear, I swear.\nMore Trending\n‘I would love to see him at Manchester United because we need players. If he can go to United and do the same that he’s doing here, I would be very happy because he scores so many goals.\n‘He scores every week! If he doesn’t score, he assists, he creates for the team. He’s very powerful, he’s a player who can run for 90 minutes at the same speed. It’s incredible.\n‘You need to come to Portugal to see one game and you will see how strong this guy is. Playing back to the goal and rotating… oh my god! No defender can stop him.’\nGyokeres’ incredible goalscoring exploits show no sign of slowing down, with the 26-year-old scoring seven goals in his last three games and 21 goals since the start of 2025.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Jadon Sancho suffers blow after ‘submitting transfer request’ to Chelsea and Manchester United\nMORE: Jack Wilshere picks the team he ‘can’t see losing’ in the Champions League final\nMORE: Arsenal star labelled ‘far too clean’ for modern football after PSG defeat",
