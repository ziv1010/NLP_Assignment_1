We played some of our best football of the season and ended up behind,\" said England star Bellingham.\nCity led 2-1 after 80 minutes through goals in each half from Erling Haaland. But Brahim Diaz and then Bellingham silenced the home crowd, and extended a sorry record for City that has seen it concede seven goals in the last 15 minutes of Champions League games this season.\n\"We need to see games out better, that's for sure,\" City defender John Stones said. \"We have to stay positive, which is difficult right now.\"\nBellingham slid in to convert Vinicius Jr's lobbed pass in the second minute of added time to bring back memories of Madrid's dramatic comeback against City in the semifinal in 2022. Then, it was Rodrygo who scored twice after the 90th minute and Madrid eventually sent Pep Guardiola's team crashing out in extra time.\nAt least City has a chance to salvage the tie in the second leg, but the sense of deflation was clear after such a late collapse.\n\"The truth is, we are not stable enough. It's not the first time, unfortunately. It has happened many times and that's why it's difficult,\" Guardiola said. \"I've been here for many years, and we have been an extraordinary team.\n\"But, at the moment I'm not able...I'm not good enough, you know, to give something, to (give) composure, to the team, to (know) how to manage the situations.\n\"In the end, we gave it away ourselves, and, at this level, it's so difficult. It's not the first time.\"\nIt was another thrilling, white knuckle-ride of a game between these two giants of European soccer, and a one-goal advantage for Madrid means there is still all to play for.\nDefeat ended City's 35-game unbeaten run at home in the Champions League, dating back to 2018.\nCity took the lead through Haaland's 19-minute goal.\nBy that stage, Madrid had seen a penalty overturned for offside and a goalbound effort from Ferland Mendy blocked by Manuel Akanji.\nVinicius then hit the bar with a curling shot and Akanji also clipped the frame of the goal with a header.\nHaaland hit the bar again less than a minute into the second half.\nMadrid equalized on the hour through a freakish goal from Mbappe, when his miskicked volley wrong-footed Ederson and looped softly over the line.\nMbappe hit the post with another chance before Dani Ceballos brought Phil Foden down just inside the box, and Haaland's penalty restored City's lead.\nOn came former City academy player Diaz, who left City for Madrid in 2019, to level the game again before Bellingham's winner.\n\"I don't care what form City are in, they are still an unbelievable team and so difficult to play against, the way they move you and manipulate your position,\" Bellingham said.\n\"It's always really tricky to play against them, and, in the end we took one of the many chances, finally, and made it count.\"\nCity splashed out more than $211 million in the January transfer window in a desperate attempt to revive its fortunes.\nBut none of Nico Gonzalez, Omar Marmoush or Abdukodir Khusanov started, while Vitor Reis was not included in City's European squad for the knockout stages.\nInstead, Guardiola put his faith in those that have delivered for him in the past.\nNot for the first time this season, they ran out of steam in the closing stages, as Madrid took a massive step towards ending City's Champions League dream for the third time in four years.\nAgencies\nMost Popular\n- Guangdong beats Macao 2-0 in first leg of soccer cup\n- Para teams set to leave mark on ice\n- US skier Johnson wins women's downhill as Vonn crashes at Milan-Cortina Games\n- Su Yiming clinches first medal at Milano-Cortina\n- Over 300 athletes from 35 countries and regions kick off Asian championships in Tianjin\n- Legacy of Beijing 2022 lives on as Milan welcomes Games",
