He didn’t get enough time.\n‘He should have got more time. And also the only mistake I think he made was he didn’t have anyone. Someone should have been there for him, someone like Mike Phelan or someone.’\nMoyes spoke out on his dismissal from Old Trafford last year, saying: ‘It’s part of the life of a football manager. There’s very few managers who have things always go in one direction. You have lots of ups and downs. Even the best managers have times when it’s not so good.\n‘I had to find a way of fighting back from the disappointment of losing my job at Manchester United and finding ways to get myself back to a good level.’\nDavid Moyes' Man Utd record\nMatches: 51\nWon: 27\nDrawn: 9\nLost: 15\nSpeaking in 2019, he suggested his dismissal had not achieved much, telling talkSPORT: ‘I feel that since I took over to where they are just now, I don’t think there’s an awful lot of difference\nMore Trending\n‘When I took over it was needing a change and needing a turnaround of players, and that was all going to take time.\n‘I feel like in the four years or so since I was managing there, it’s probably not moved on much more.\n‘It’s quite similar, they’re still saying there needs to be changes and has to be things done.\n‘That time since I felt hasn’t been used awfully well.’\nMORE: Man Utd vs Tottenham: Latest team news, predicted lineups and injuries\nMORE: Amorim had dinner with £64m star before Man Utd signed Mbeumo instead\nMORE: Police shut down UK-based illegal IPTV streaming network that made £3 million after Sky complaint",
