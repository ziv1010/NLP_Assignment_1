David Moyes, meanwhile, is hesitant to sell his star defender.\nThe Toffees turned down multiple offers from Manchester United for Branthwaite last summer, the highest of which was worth around £50m. Everton expect interest in Branthwaite to return in the summer window and multiple sources claim offers are imminent.\nChelsea are considering Branthwaite as one of several young central defenders. The Blues rate Branthwaite highly and have put the 22-year-old on a shortlist that also contains Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi and Ajax teenager Jorell Hato.\nSpurs are also weighing up an approach. The North Londoners sealed Champions League qualification after winning the Europa League, salvaging a dismal domestic campaign in the process.\nDespite doubts over Ange Postecoglou’s future, Spurs are ready to make an offer for Branthwaite to boost their defensive stocks. Micky van de Ven has endured an injury-hit time at Tottenham, while Cristian Romero is courting interest from Spain.\nManchester United also remain interested in Branthwaite despite the addition of Leny Yoro 12 months ago. Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans have departed on free transfers, while Lisandro Martinez remains sidelined with an ACL injury. However, a lack of European football could hinder the club’s spending power in the summer market.\nBranthwaite has 2 years to run on his Everton deal and the Blues could see his value drop in a year’s time. Everton do not want to lose the defender, who has emerged as one of the Premier League’s top defensive prospects on Merseyside.\nHowever, Branthwaite could consider his options amid the prospect of Champions League football, having been overlooked for Thomas Tuchel’s first two England squads. His exit would be a big blow, but having been signed for just £1m from Carlisle, a significant sale would greatly improve Everton’s Profit and Sustainability (PSR) calculations. In what is set to be a massive summer of rebuilding, a huge offer could tempt.\nReader Comments (53)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

But if someone ticks that £100M box, then I'm afraid we'd have to sell.\nBut you're having a laugh if you think we \"need\" to sell at £50-60M.\n3 Posted 03/06/2025 at 17:39:41\nWe should build around Branthwaite, but if someone offered £100M and he wanted to go, there would be a way forward.\nAny less than that and we're absolute mugs.\n4 Posted 03/06/2025 at 17:47:18\nI'd hate to lose him, but I'd bet that we'd take £75M if he really wanted to go and/or was refusing to sign a new contract. And that's assuming we had a couple £20M options on the table to replace him and build out the rest of the squad.\n5 Posted 03/06/2025 at 17:58:44\nI'm not necessarily disagreeing with your amazement at the Maguire price but, at the time, he was playing at a fantastic level for both Leicester and England, and it was Man Utd paying it.\nI believe that he has recently played again at that level. I think that he could be a massive bonus for us for a couple of seasons, possibly scoring some important goals.\nBranthwaite for £100M? I doubt that market exists now but it would be marvellous business for us by any measure.\nOur club size means that there is a certain standard of player that we can't keep because of wages, the profit from sale and our lack of European football. Look at our momentum over the last part of the season – we were bloody good.\n6 Posted 03/06/2025 at 18:00:27\n7 Posted 03/06/2025 at 18:25:50\nHe's had a good season, but he needs to go after an excellent one, then he can go to a top tier club for top dollar. A move to Spurs at this point would be insane.\n8 Posted 03/06/2025 at 18:40:20\nLet's not fall for the \"keeping an unhappy player\" myth. Spurs kept Kane till it suited them and he didn't down tools. Neither will Branthwaite.\n9 Posted 03/06/2025 at 19:04:39\nMoyes and the club have already said he's not for sale, so it will take something astronomical for us to sell him, and that astronomical fee in my eyes should be a minimum £100M.\nOr it could be a player plus cash, but a player we think would be beneficial for us, not some no-mark 35-year-old bench-warmer the buying club are desperate to get rid of.\n10 Posted 03/06/2025 at 19:23:28\nHe's likely to stay, which would be encouraging, but – if he's sold – that could be telling.\n11 Posted 03/06/2025 at 19:24:10\nWe should be making him one of our top earners with a new contract. I believe it's paper nonsense that he was overlooked for the England squad because he's not with the so-called top clubs.\n12 Posted 03/06/2025 at 19:45:36\n£100M at least or no deal.\n13 Posted 03/06/2025 at 19:48:59\nSimilarly, Jarrod Bowen's surprise omission is down to him no doubt being on honeymoon having got married last weekend.\nOr Tuchel doesn't like their similarly spelled first names.\nRe Jarrad – I read somewhere that he is keen to stay with us and become captain one day. Whilst that is great news if true, he needs to have an improved contract if what I have also read about his low weekly salary is correct.\nI assume Jarrad wants to play at a higher level where he can win things. We're a long way from that. I guess a lot depends on how ambitious he is.\n14 Posted 03/06/2025 at 20:03:52\nIt would be a shame to break our defence up but I think defenders are easier to replace than attackers.\n15 Posted 03/06/2025 at 20:12:59\nEverton get no bids for Jarrad Branthwaite\n16 Posted 03/06/2025 at 20:17:08\nWe've seen so many talented young players leave us that I'm just accepting of it now. From Jeffers and Ball to Lukaku and Barkley, with a helping of a young lad called Wayne in the middle, I just know they're looking for that Big Move!\nIt's hard for me to see anything different happening with Branthwaite, so let's just hope we get the best deal possible and reinvest wisely. Unlike the disaster of 2017.\n17 Posted 03/06/2025 at 20:44:31\nWhere is this speculation coming from? Who is the source at Chelsea and Spurs?\nAlmost certainly the press and the agents.\nBe strong Everton – build a team around Branthwaite.\n18 Posted 03/06/2025 at 20:53:13\nEverton are not entertaining bids anyway.\nJarrad is happy with his development.\nNext...\n19 Posted 03/06/2025 at 20:55:21\nThis is a big test for Everton: if they want to be a big time team, you don't sell your best players. We've had enough of this for the last 20 years, but were forced to sell players for financial reasons.\nSurely now we have the financial backing to stop this sort of thing.\n20 Posted 03/06/2025 at 20:58:02\n21 Posted 03/06/2025 at 21:03:56\nMartin, I look forward to seeing you again next season. Great walk through the park and conversation on the way to Fulham in the sun.\n22 Posted 03/06/2025 at 21:05:30\nI've heard that our new owners want to make a bank-busting statement. Rice has fallen out with Arteta and wants a move; he has, no kidding, been talking to Moyes.\n23 Posted 03/06/2025 at 21:06:05\n24 Posted 03/06/2025 at 21:26:52\n25 Posted 03/06/2025 at 21:27:30\nThe shoe is wholly on the owners foot as Jarrad is under contract for another 2 years at least - he only signed a new deal last year - but people on here thinking that the Americans are anything but businessmen will get their 'sugar daddy' eyes opened quite quickly I believe.\nAlso, don't forget that Carlisle United have a 15% sell-on clause, so even a hefty £75m sale nets down to £63.75m to the Everton coffers.\n26 Posted 03/06/2025 at 21:31:17\nWhat will be will be. We don't have any control over it.\nMore immediately, I'm hoping to hear news that Gana has signed a new deal.\nThen we can focus on new additions.\n27 Posted 03/06/2025 at 21:53:10\nThen as now there are some decent LCB options out there - one is Zeze of Nantes whom we and others are linked with.\nAs it happens Wolfsburg bought Koulierakis last summer for €11.5m and he’s been a big success. He’s linked with the RS now as a successor to VVD.\nIt is likely that we will need to develop and sell a few very good players before we have assembled a high quality squad. Unfortunately there are now 8 or 9 much richer clubs and even with TFG on board we won’t be able to outspend our way their.\nI don’t think this summer is a good time to sell but if we don’t extend his contract next summer might not be good timing either.\nAt some point we have to get much better at selling and much better at buying.\n28 Posted 03/06/2025 at 21:54:39\nSome controversy when Kilman was sold from Wolves to West Ham. Maidenhead were entitled to £8m or 20%, but agreed on 10% to get the deal done.\n29 Posted 03/06/2025 at 22:29:09\nIs he just moving house or planning to move away?\n30 Posted 03/06/2025 at 23:30:19\nWe still have Tarks, Keano and Obrien and anyone else we can buy with experience.\nPersonally I like Semenya at Bournemouth but you know that won't happen.\nLet's wait and hope.\n31 Posted 03/06/2025 at 23:54:05\nHe's the most valuable player in our squad in terms of transfer value — and only Pickford right now is more important to our fortunes — and as such, he's worthy of at least £150,000 per week. I'd even give him 5 years at his age.\n32 Posted 04/06/2025 at 00:16:47\n33 Posted 04/06/2025 at 01:05:24\nWait until the window closes then start negotiations and have it wrapped up by Christmas.\n34 Posted 04/06/2025 at 05:34:08\nBut also by extending him now, you hopefully minimize the chances he gets tempted by other teams this window. You tell him to give us 2 more years and then he can go wherever he wants for the right price. Shit, make him the captain now, too, do whatever it takes to massage his ego.\nIt's all well and good to say we can tell him to play out his contract, and technically we can, but in this day and age, money and Champions League talk, and we have to do everything possible to keep him happy if we want him here. It's not ideal to think that way, but it's the reality.\n35 Posted 04/06/2025 at 09:43:57\nI worry for my blood pressure when I can’t assess what might be genuine ITK and what is basic speculation.\nNot helped by our resident bantz maestros adding their mischievous ‘information’ to the mix.\nMaybe time for a ToffeeWeb hiatus and switching to the OS until all the trading is concluded.\nIf JB gets sold I don’t really want to know about it anyway.\n36 Posted 04/06/2025 at 09:53:00\nKeep your blood pressure down by waiting until the club announces. That's when we will know.\nEric, I tend to agree with you. There is no rush just yet. If he's going to leave in the summer, he wouldn't accept a new contract and leave. So yes, leave it until he's playing for us next season and get him signed up on extended terms. It will cost us, but you get what you pay for.\n37 Posted 04/06/2025 at 10:02:27\n38 Posted 04/06/2025 at 10:18:34\nThere aren’t any straightforward options here because Branthwaite holds a lot of the cards and might, like Delap, choose to take his chance with a Champions League regular side rather than extend his contract. He’ll be paid handsomely whatever option he takes.\n39 Posted 04/06/2025 at 10:34:55\nI don't think there is a club in the Premiership were there isn't a huge disparity of pay between players. I think somebody said Branthwaite is on about £35,000 per week compared to Doucoure who was on allegedly £133,000 per week.\nSo I don't see a problem making Branthwaite amongst our top earners, and for those in the squad who don't like it then tough thats what has always happened since the £20 salary cap was abolished by Jimmy Hill and George Eastham.\nI think this is a big test for TFG in as much as do they want to keep our most talented or do we become a Brentford and Bournemouth who will probably never win anything but they will survive by selling their best players.\n40 Posted 04/06/2025 at 11:37:49\n41 Posted 04/06/2025 at 11:40:23\nEven if they get between say 10% and 25% it’s a decent margin on the age bill overall. We can say no of course but it may cause umbrage with players and agents - making recruitment more difficult.\nThere’s no straightforward solution and much of how this lands is up to Branthwaite.\n42 Posted 04/06/2025 at 11:45:51\nI don't think its the right time to sell Branthwaite. His contract still has time to go and there will already be a lot of flux this summer. Keep him one more year, hopefully he has a great season and we can sell for £75m+ next summer. There are LOADS of great young defenders out there and perhaps we should be looking to bring one in this summer so he has a year to adjust before replacing JB next summer. This is very much what Brighton try to do.\n43 Posted 04/06/2025 at 12:23:02\nUTFT\n44 Posted 04/06/2025 at 12:26:51\n45 Posted 04/06/2025 at 12:56:28\n46 Posted 04/06/2025 at 13:03:16\nHe's left sided which is a plus and he's a good player but I don't think he's had a outstanding season, Pickford has kept our goals conceeded down more than our defenders for me.\nHe was a media darling in his first season which always ups the ante.\nI would rather sell Brenthwaite than Pickford.\n47 Posted 04/06/2025 at 13:04:45\nI've a feeling the Club is cutting down on high salary players and we'll see sub-£100k wages across the team. So if Branthwaite or any other payer say well X have offered me £150k we say well if they meet our evaluation then you can go play for X.\nPlayers \"value\" that they bring to a team, and I mean that playing wise, not money wise, should be recognised. Remember Pienaar left 'cos he wanted parity with Arteta and look how that turned out. But that \"value\" has to consistent, not a show of potential, but stepping up and meeting that potential consistently in terms of younger players.\n48 Posted 04/06/2025 at 13:37:37\nThat can be managed though. I have learned that. It was much easier in the Army. That's what you get paid. No negotiation.\nPeople and players will always want the best deal for themselves, but know where they sit in the pecking order.\nI can't see Branthwaite leaving in the summer, but as you say Martin, nothing would surprise us in football. We will need to tie him up to an extension before next summer.\nVery true Sam @42. Players come and go in the name of business. It's how you reinvest that matters.\nAnd yes, I look forward to seeing you and Mark next season Martin, always a pleasure.\nBrian @37, I'd rather the club kept quiet and didn't talk about it. A bit like the commentator's kiss of death or when the board comes out giving a manager unreserved backing. You know they're on their way out when that statement is announced.\nSilence is golden as the song goes.\n49 Posted 04/06/2025 at 13:44:08\nThe lad has all the attributes, one of which is generally superior anticipation which makes it seem like he’s not had to do much at all to neutralise a situation.\nHe has the odd mistake in him (they all do) but should get even better with a couple more years of experience.\nIt’s not just Everton fans. All the pundits rate him extremely highly. Or that would be overrate him, in your opinion?\n50 Posted 04/06/2025 at 13:59:23\n51 Posted 04/06/2025 at 14:08:36\nNot in the same league as other big CB sales Stones or Lescott.\nDecent player and wouldn’t want to see him go but not a world beater by any stretch.\n52 Posted 04/06/2025 at 14:15:41\nOur defence has been our biggest asset and it would be a risk to split it up, he's a good player and time will tell just how good he will become.\nI feel he's not as good as he is being portrayed.\n53 Posted 05/06/2025 at 13:46:56\n\"I feel he's not as good as he is being portrayed.\" Well, we love him, and United certainly have a bromance with him, but as I said above, let Branthwaite, and others, show some consistency before we handsomely reward them.\nRemember Stones and how we were all made up that we didn't let Chelsea have him; then, only a season later, we sold him to Man City for much less.\n54 Posted 06/06/2025 at 22:28:54\nAre you talking about ability or price tag, John?\nI liked Joleon Lescott but surely he's a clear third out of the trio? He was pacy and good in the air but I don't remember him being particularly comfortable in possession of the ball.\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
