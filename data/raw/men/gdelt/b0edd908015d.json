But the application of this rule towards a commentator is “unprecedented and unwelcome” according to Sky Sports – the outlet where Neville is their lead broadcaster.\n🚨EXCLUSIVE\n🔴Nottingham Forest have BANNED Sky's Gary Neville from Sunday's game\n⚪️Club can decide who is allowed on their property\n🔴Move comes after recent criticism\n📺Neville has chosen not to attend with Sky's full backing\n😠Sky say: 'unprecedented & unwelcome'…— Mike Keegan (@MikeKeegan_DM) May 23, 2025\nTweet: “EXCLUSIVE: Nottingham Forest have BANNED Sky’s Gary Neville from Sunday’s game. Club can decide who is allowed on their property. Move comes after recent criticism. Neville has chosen not to attend with Sky’s full backing. Sky say: ‘unprecedented & unwelcome’.”\nKeegan reports Forest believe Neville “has a grudge against them” and the East Midlands club have made a formal complaint about him to Sky Sports after the 50-year-old’s comments about owner, Evangelos Marinakis.\n“Forest have formally complained to Sky about Neville, with the broadcaster announcing his role in the Sunday showdown a number of days ago. Since then, Forest have made their feelings clear.\n“The Premier League is known to be aware of the situation. Mail Sport understands it is within the gift of all member clubs to decide who comes on to their property – and so the league will not intervene ahead of a clash between two sides battling for a place in European football’s elite competition.”\n“Sky Sports have described Forest’s action is ‘unprecedented and unwelcome’. They have decided to revise their production plans and will now present from their west London HQ. It is understood that Neville himself has chosen not to be part of the coverage, with Sky’s full backing. The broadcaster will still have a commentary team at the ground.”\nNeville publicly responded to the unprecedent situation on his Instagram page, stating how “disappointing” the decision was but wishing Nuno Espirito Santo’s side luck in their season-defining match with Chelsea.\n“I was informed yesterday by Sky Sports that Nottingham Forest would not give me an accreditation or access to the stadium as a co-commentator. I’ve had no choice but to withdraw from the coverage. I’ve dished out my fair share of criticism and praise in the last 14 years of doing this job and have never come close to this unprecedented action.\n“Personally, I think it’s disappointing that a great club like Nottingham Forest have been reduced to making such a decision. Whilst they have every right to choose who they let into their own stadium, it’s symptomatic of things that have happened over the last 12 months with the club.\n“I wish the coaching staff, players and fans of the club all the best in their quest to achieve Champions League football.”\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
