He wants to stay at Chelsea, I'm sure he does. I don't for the life of me understand, and I don't know the dealings - they're probably far apart on where they're valuing each other. He probably thinks: 'Where do I sit?'.\nWatch 90min's exclusive interview with Joe Cole as the Chelsea legend talks to Scott Saunders & Harry Symeou about the pressure mounting on Graham Potter, the need to tie Mason Mount down to a new contract, the club's transfer policy and more.\nIf you can't see this embed, click here to watch the video!\n\"He's out the team now, which is a dangerous position to be in for Mason and for Chelsea. Football is very fickle, we can forget what a good player Mason Mount is. Even more so in this generation, players go away for three or four weeks and they're forgotten. I think Chelsea need to remember what a great player he is. He will come good.\n\"[A contract renewal] would be the top of my list. There must be some middle ground to solve it.\"\nChelsea remain keen to negotiate with Mount and have not yet given up hope of keeping the midfielder, but a difficult decision will have to be made if he enters the final 12 months of his current contract without inking an extension.",
