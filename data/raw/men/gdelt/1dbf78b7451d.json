Twelve teams from 10 different European countries entered this season's group stage, with the group winners qualifying for the final four mini-tournament at the Stadio Tre Stelle in Desenzano del Garda.\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/10535/209661_fenixtrophyimage.jpg\nThe FENIX Trophy Tournament, called the \"Champions League for Amateurs\" by BBC Sport, is a property created, owned and operated by Brera, and FC United of Manchester beat Prague Raptors 4-0, to earn a second Fenix title crown in three years.\nLewes FC won the third-place game when it scored a last-minute winner against Enfield Town FC, for a 2-1 victory.\nESPN.com reported that FC United manager Neil Reynolds said: \"It was devastating last year when we didn't do it and we got beat in the semifinal. But to give something back to this amazing football club, it's what this weekend was about. We wanted to win the trophy for the fans and that's what we've done.\"\n\"This year's edition of the FENIX Trophy Tournament surpassed the first two editions, on and off the pitch, as the Stadio Tre Stelle hosted four top notch games and Desenzano del Garda on Lake Garda is an amazing setting,\" said Brera Holdings CEO Pierre Galoppi.\nFor further FENIX Trophy information:\nhttps://www.fenixtrophy.eu/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/wearefenixtrophy/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/fenixtrophy/\nABOUT BRERA HOLDINGS PLC\nBrera Holdings PLC (NASDAQ: BREA) is focused on expanding its social impact football (American soccer) business by developing a global portfolio of emerging football and other sports clubs with increased opportunities to earn tournament prizes, gain sponsorships, and provide other professional football- and sports-related consulting services.\nThe Company seeks to build on the legacy and brand of Brera FC, the first football club that was acquired by the Company in 2022. Brera FC, known as \"The Third Team of Milan,\" is an amateur football association which has been building an alternative football legacy since its founding in 2000. The Company owns the trademarked FENIX Trophy Tournament, a non-professional pan-European football competition recognized by UEFA, inaugurated in September 2021 and organized by Brera FC. \"FENIX\" is an acronym for \"Friendly European Non-professional Innovative Xenial.\" BBC Sport has called the FENIX Trophy \"the Champions League for amateurs,\" and Brera FC hosted the 2023 finals at Milan's legendary San Siro Stadium. The 2024 FENIX Trophy finals were covered by ESPN. In October 2022, the Internet Marketing Association at its IMPACT 22 Conference named Brera FC as its award recipient for \"Social Impact Through Soccer,\" recognizing the Company's focus at an international level with this distinction.\nIn March 2023, the Company expanded to Africa with the establishment of Brera Tchumene FC, a team then admitted to the Second Division League in Mozambique, a country of nearly 32 million people. Brera Tchumene FC won its post-season tournament and in November 2023 was promoted to Mocambola, the First Division in Mozambique. In April 2023, the Company acquired 90% of the European first division football team Fudbalski Klub Akademija Pandev in North Macedonia, a country with participation rights in two major Union of European Football Association (\"UEFA\") competitions.\nIn June 2023, Brera acquired a strategic stake in Manchester United PLC, a portion of which was subject to a tender offer by Sir Jim Radcliffe and sold at a 74% realized gain. In July 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of a majority ownership in the Italian Serie A1 women's professional volleyball team UYBA Volley S.s.d.a.r.l. In September 2023, the Company assumed control of Bayanzurkh Sporting Ilch FC, a team in the Mongolian National Premier League, which became Brera Ilch FC when the football season resumed in March 2024. In January 2024, the Company announced the launch of a proactive search for an Italian Serie B football club target designed to bring multi-club ownership of the highest tiers of professional sports ownership to mass investors through the Company's Nasdaq-listed shares. In February 2024 the Brera Holdings Advisory Board was established with MLS founder and World Cup director Alan Rothenberg, luxury lifestyle executive Massimo Ferragamo, sports business leaders Paul Tosetti and Marshall Geller, and Italian football icon Giuseppe Rossi.\nIn May 2024 with a landmark decision the North Macedonian women's football association voted to assign all of the association's rights and property for a Strumica-based team now named Brera Tiverija to a joint stock company that is fully owned by Brera Holdings' subsidiary Brera Strumica. This marks the first time the association has allowed a for-profit company to operate a women's football team, and brings gender equity to the sport in Macedonia, with additional and needed resources now being available from Brera Holdings to develop the club.\nBrera Holdings PLC is focused on bottom-up value creation from undervalued sports clubs and talent, innovation-powered business growth, and socially-impactful outcomes.
