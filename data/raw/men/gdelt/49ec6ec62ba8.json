Madrid has nine days to prepare, nine days.\n\"They play this weekend and they won't do it again until our game. I would like to reflect and ask for one more day, because the difference is a lot.\"\nFollowing Madrid's 2-0 win at home to Athletic Club on Sunday evening, Ancelotti was asked for his thoughts on Guardiola's comments and ceded that his side will indeed have a 'small advantage'.\n\"I see it well, they have a more complicated schedule, it is modern football,\" Ancelotti said. \"It is obvious that we have a small advantage, but it will not affect the match. I really liked the handling of today's match and a little less intensity.\"\nMadrid have been paired with City in the knockout stages of the Champions League for a third successive season having met them in the semi-finals in each of the last two campaigns.\nThe winner of this tie will face either Arsenal or Bayern Munich in the semi-finals, with Atletico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona on the other side of the draw.",
