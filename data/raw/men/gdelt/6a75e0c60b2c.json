It’s an international break and we’ve got the World Cup on our minds.\nOn the way:\n- Bloated World Cup?\n- Poch’s trusty assistant\n- Paris remembered\n- 3-4-3 broken down\nMore ‘Minnows’: How will rising to a 48-team format affect the World Cup?\nWhich match springs to mind when you first think of the World Cup? Argentina pipping France to the title in that thrilling final in 2022? Brazil giving a masterclass in the beautiful game against Italy in the 1970 equivalent? How about Uzbekistan versus Jordan in 2026?\nAdvertisement\n‘Remember that time when Khusayin Norchaev belted a 25-yard scorcher past Yazeed Abulaila to seal a 4-3 comeback for the Uzbeks in Los Angeles’, we’ll say.\nThis is purely hypothetical, of course, but fixtures of that ilk may be part of a new reality for World Cups, with the greatest tournament the sport has to offer increasing its number of competing nations from 32 to 48 for the first time at next year’s edition.\nSo as we watch another 14 countries earn their spots at the tournament this month (with Mexico, Canada and the United States automatically qualifying as the co-hosts), when more unlikely nations — potentially Kosovo and Suriname, for example — reach the finals, is this a good thing for the global game, or does it potentially dilute the quality of football’s hallowed competition?\nIncreasing the number of teams getting to the World Cup to almost a quarter of FIFA’s 210 football nations has already had an impact during qualification, particularly in Europe, where jeopardy has been minimal (although Italy are trying their best to make things interesting) and South America, where, somewhat ludicrously, 90 matches were played to whittle the 10 nations down to six qualifiers (with a seventh potentially getting in via the inter-continental play-offs in March).\nIt’ll be a similar story at next year’s finals, when 72 matches will be played across the group stage to eliminate just 16 of the 48 teams.\nFiddling with the format also means a more convoluted path to the final. For example, a team could draw all three of their group games and still get through to the knockout phase.\nMore money, but more upsets?\nOn the flip side, calling some of these nations ‘minnows’ feels a bit disingenuous — Portugal, winners of Euro 2016, were football minnows in the not-too-distant past. Uzbekistan today is a football-mad nation of 36 million people, and their team have come desperately close to qualifying three times in the past.\nAdvertisement\nAnd who could view those wonderful scenes of Cape Verde celebrating qualification for the first time and decry them getting a place?\nThe problem is that people don’t generally think FIFA is expanding the World Cup for the good of the game. It’s perceived that it’s for the good of the organisation’s pockets, instead. More teams equals more matches, more TV money, more ticket money, more sponsorship money, heck, even more car-parking money.\nThen there’s the ongoing issue of player burnout, which is again contributed to by FIFA and its European equivalent, UEFA, with their expanded competitions, such as the Club World Cup and the Champions League.\nNew nations can surprise you, though, given the opportunity. When the Euros expanded from 16 teams to 24 in 2016, Iceland reached the quarter-finals and Wales famously got to the last four.\nNick Miller has articulated it much better than I can here, when he says the World Cup should be about great stories, which some of these new nations will surely give us.\nTo paraphrase the 2010 UK general election, I agree with Nick.\nThe likes of Jordan and Cape Verde should also add excitement and intrigue to a group stage that will be largely devoid of jeopardy.\nWhether we like it or not, get used to it; football is still the beautiful game at heart, but it’s the gluttonous game more than anything in 2025.\n- Another purchasing window has opened for 2026 World Cup tickets, and there are more price hikes, reports Henry Bushnell.\nNews round-up\n- There’s potentially a huge shake-up on the way in MLS, where owners could vote today on changing the league’s calendar to align with European leagues, i.e., playing through the winter from August to May. It’s also proposed that MLS moves to a single-table system, via five divisions rather than the current two conferences.\n- Awful news from Spain on Wednesday, where Atletico Madrid Femenino player Andrea Medina was taken to hospital after suffering a “traumatic brain injury” during their 2-1 Champions League defeat to Juventus. The 21-year-old was put in the recovery position by the assistant referee after staying down following a slide tackle. She is said to be doing well in hospital.\n- If the Premier League votes to bring in an effective salary cap at a meeting of clubs next week, the Professional Footballers’ Association has suggested its members could launch legal action. Sure, players don’t earn enough, if anything.\n- There were boos and jeers when hot topic Mary Earps returned to face Manchester United on Wednesday for the first time since leaving the club last year. She didn’t have the best night, with Paris Saint-Germain losing 2-1. But at least she got a front-row seat for Olga Carmona’s stunning goal, above.\n- Ever heard of an international tournament staging both semis and the final at the same stadium? Well, yes, the pan-European Euro 2020 at Wembley, and it’s going to be happening in that corner of London again at the UK and Ireland-hosted Euro 2028, with England (if they haven’t lost in the quarter-finals on penalties) the likely beneficiaries. Welsh capital Cardiff gets the tournament’s opening match.\n- England host Serbia in a dead rubber World Cup qualifier tonight, and head coach Thomas Tuchel has stated Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden can’t fit into the team together in his current system. The square-pegs-in-round-holes era may finally be over, folks.\n- Lionel Messi trespassed at Barcelona’s Camp Nou the other night and said he misses the club he left four years ago with his soul. Club president Joan Laporta, though, says a return for the now 38-year-old Argentinian isn’t realistic. Inter Miami will be pleased.\nHorror in Paris: Witnesses recall trauma 10 years after Stade de France terror attacks\nIt is 10 years to the day since 130 people lost their lives and more than 400 were injured when a 10-man Islamist terror cell went on a deadly rampage across Paris.\nNo one who merely watched the horrific images unfolding on television that fateful night will forget the grim details of the deadliest attack on the French capital since the Second World War, let alone those who were unfortunate enough to be in Paris at the time.\nAdvertisement\nThe horrors began at the Stade de France, where three suicide bombers targeted the match being played there between France and Germany, killing a 63-year-old Portuguese man, Manuel Colaco Dias, after they were refused entry to the ground.\n“Suddenly, there was a huge boom,” grassroots football coordinator Denis Carrel recalls to The Athletic’s Tom Williams, as the second device was detonated. “The whoosh ruffled my trousers and my body shook. I didn’t look, but I remember a woman saying, ‘There’s a man there!’. People were screaming and shouting. I said to my colleague, ‘This is serious’. Then I started running.”\nA decade since those awful events, others also spoke to Tom, including a steward, and former France midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin, who remembers being oblivious to events until the end of the match, assuming the noises he heard were simply fans’ smoke bombs.\nBut then came the sheer panic as France’s capital city came under siege. It’s a harrowing tale.\nTrusted Lieutenant: How Poch’s No 2, Perez, will have big impact on USMNT’s World Cup\nJust about every great football manager needs a trusty, low-key assistant, and Mauricio Pochettino certainly has one in Jesus Perez, who has been by his side across a string of jobs since 2010.\nWhile the public glare will be fixed firmly on Pochettino next summer as he attempts to do something special with the USMNT side (answers on a postcard as to what that actually is) at the World Cup, Perez is, as long-serving U.S. defender Tim Ream says, the glue that keeps everyone and everything together.\nPaul Tenorio has delved into how and why Perez is such an important figure in Pochettino’s career, with plenty of citations from players, including France’s World Cup 2018-winning captain Hugo Lloris, who credits Perez for improving his game.\nPerez was a fitness coach at first, then an analyst, before becoming Pochettino’s right-hand man at Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, and now the USMNT. Other than being a trusted advisor, he has a big impact on the squad as a coach, but also, in effect, as a chief of staff, keeping everything ticking along in all departments.\nAdvertisement\n“Jesus and Mauricio, they’re people that can really push through your barriers and help you reach higher levels,” current West Bromwich Albion head coach Ryan Mason, who played under them at Tottenham, says.\nA nation will be hoping that’s certainly the case next year.\nAround TAFC\n- Only three things are certain in life; death, taxes and Ruben Amorim playing 3-4-3. Xabi Alonso, Antonio Conte and Oliver Glasner are fellow exponents of a formation that’s been on the rise in recent years, so what are the benefits and/or origins of it? As part of our series on historical formations, data egghead Thom Harris has delved into what makes it work. It’s a fascinating piece, which Amorim has no doubt already made the United players read.\n- What if every single Premier League match, including the Saturday 3pm games, was streamed on the same single service? And you just paid a fixed rate every season to access it? That’s an idea explored by Adam Leventhal in the latest part of his special series on football streaming. He’s called it ‘Premflix’, a name which may need a bit of work.\n- There’s an interesting football story brewing in Bedford, which has never been said before. Real Bedford are intent on climbing all the way to the Premier League (it’ll take them a while, they’re currently seven divisions away from taking on Liverpool and company). This project isn’t exactly a fairytale — they’re backed by Bitcoin money via billionaire entrepreneur twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and the club’s chairman hosts a controversial podcast, plus they’ve put noses out of joint at fellow non-League neighbours Bedford Town. Anyway, it’s certainly a curious tale.\n- Most clicked in Wednesday’s TAFC: Could Jude Bellingham be a backup No 9 for England?\nCatch a match\n(Selected matches, times ET/UK)\nConcacaf World Cup qualifiers (all on CBS Sports, Paramount+, U.S only): Trinidad and Tobago vs Jamaica, 7pm; Bermuda vs Curacao, 7pm; Haiti vs Costa Rica, 9pm.\nUEFA World Cup qualifiers (all 2.45pm/7.45pm): England vs Serbia — Fox Soccer Plus, Fubo/ITV; France vs Ukraine — FS2, Fubo/Amazon Prime PPV; Republic of Ireland vs Portugal — Fubo, ViX/Amazon Prime PPV.\nAnd finally…\nWhat lengths would you go to so you could watch your team take on their fierce local rivals in a league match for the first time in 13 years?\nWell, two Portsmouth fans wore high-vis jackets and carried radio equipment to try to pass themselves off as stewards so they could gain access to Southampton’s stadium for the Championship match with their neighbours in September, in what was described as a “ridiculous plot” by authorities and “excellent banter” by fellow football supporters.\nThey’ve both received three-year football banning orders. Probably not worth it for what ended up being a 0-0 draw, to be honest…",
