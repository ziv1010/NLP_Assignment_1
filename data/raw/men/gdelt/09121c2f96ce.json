Madrid subsequently appealed the decision, but they have been unsuccessful and he will miss the upcoming clashes with Girona and Real Betis.\nControversy around referees has reigned supreme in Spain this season, with Madrid particularly ticked off by their treatment throughout the course of the campaign. The defending La Liga champions have even written a letter complaint to the Spanish Football Federation suggesting \"double standards\" are applied when Madrid are playing.\nAncelotti alluded to questionable decision-making in the aftermath of Bellingham's red card, saying \"there is a problem\" in La Liga and that Madrid must \"fight and continue\" for justice in order to facilitate change in the future.\nAs for Bellingham, he said prior to learning of his ban: \"I remember the incident very well, but also I've seen the video. The video doesn't match the [referee's] report ... I hope the footage will be reviewed. We can't change the result of this game, but I'd like to think that going forward there will be a change.\"\nInstead, Bellingham will sit on the sidelines having helped Madrid knock Manchester City out of the Champions League. They will now take on bitter rivals Atletico in the last 16, potentially booking a date with Arsenal if they overcome Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven.",
