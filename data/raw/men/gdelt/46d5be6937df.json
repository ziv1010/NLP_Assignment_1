  "body_text": "Riccardo Calafiori reported that his knee ‘felt strange’ after he sustained what looked to be a worrying looking injury playing for Italy last night.\nThe Arsenal defender slipped awkwardly while attempting to change direction in stoppage time of the Azzurri’s 2-1 Nations League play-off defeat against Germany.\nCalafiori appeared to catch his left foot on the San Siro turf and effectively performed the splits before he collapsed to the ground in pain.\nThe 22-year-old received treatment on the pitch from Italy’s medical team and although he was able to leave the pitch without the aid of a stretcher, he was moving extremely gingerly.\n‘He said that his knee feels strange, but cannot answer more precisely than that, so we’ll have to see,’ explained coach Luciano Spalletti in his press conference.\nAs he left the stadium last night, the former Bologna player was asked about his condition but he was unable to shed any major light on the situation, briefly saying ‘I still don’t know.’\nItaly play the return leg against Germany in Dortmund on Sunday evening but are almost certain to be without Calafiori who is likely to return to his club for further assessments.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?
