  "body_text": "The prospect of David Moyes returning to Everton fills me with anger, hatred and other vile thoughts. I totally despise the man – and I don’t think he’s a very good manager. He is not someone I want to see managing Everton Football Club again.\nI want to say it’s a huge mistake by The Friedkin Group but nobody knows how it will pan out. He may succeed… but then some Everton fans claim those painful 11 years when he was Kenwright’s poodle were a success for him and for Everton. Whereas all I remember is failure:\n• Failure in Champions League\n• Failure to beat any of the top teams\n• Failure in the FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool\n• Failure in FA Cup Final against Chelsea\nIf appointed, as seems to be happening today, he indeed may do what it takes to keep Everton in the Premier League this season. There’s a massive risk, however, that he may not… and that would be an incredible and indelible blight on TFG’s ownership, an unforgivable disaster that would be down to both him and them.\nNever go back: he just should not even be anywhere near consideration for the job. I’m going to compile some of the more pertinent opinions and bombard every Everton email I can find in an attempt to let them know how much this dreadful decision will split the fanbase.\nReader Comments (251)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Why does football create so many crazy emotions, inside of me?\n5 Posted 10/01/2025 at 13:28:09\nFailure in Champions league - we are currently nowhere near that\nFailure in Fa Cup semi final - we are currently nowhere near that\nFailure in Fa Cup final - we are currently nowhere near that\nFailure to beat any of the top teams - not true, besides its performances against our peers and mid table teams now that will keep us in this league\nI think if we were a mid table or better team looking to move onto the next level then I would agree with you, but we are not and we need a steadying hand. Long term appointment, yes I want someone more dynamic but it’s horses for courses at the moment I’m afraid.\nWhat I think is important at this time whether you agree with Moyes’s appointment or not is if that’s the decision of TFG then we should get behind him and the team for Everton’s sake.\nI know I will be.\n6 Posted 10/01/2025 at 13:30:15\n7 Posted 10/01/2025 at 13:32:42\n8 Posted 10/01/2025 at 13:36:42\n9 Posted 10/01/2025 at 13:37:48\nIf Moyes comes in for 18 months (plus 12 month option for us), I would trust him to stabilise the squad and bring in some emerging talent. I think Moyes despite his history, is a better bet than Potter - I think he can set up a team better defensively. Moyes I think would out-point Potter. West Ham will really find out if Potter has any substance - my bet is not.\nWould either win a trophy? probably not.\n10 Posted 10/01/2025 at 13:43:06\nTo fail in the champs league, an f a cup semi and an f a cup final, I think most Evertonians would give a right testicle to even be competing in a champs league, or cup final, let’s not forget that yes he did not beat any of the top 6, he did a damn good job of beating best of the rest.\nGive me 3 points everytime against teams around us, than 1 point to those in the top 6.\nThe problem Moyes faced was everytime he built a team close to competing, we lost players to the top teams, he was forced to sell players, starting with Rooney, Stones, Fellaini, Arteta, Pienar for a short while, Lescott, Gravesen.\nWhen I look at Everton from Walter Smith onwards, I see our club struggling until the Moyes era, then you have 1 season of Martniz playing great football, then shite in his second season, since then Managers have come and gone, Silva did an ok job, Carlo did a great job then tailed off towards the end of his tenure.\nWhether Moyes is the answer or not, and me personally I think he is the best choice for the short term, with possibly an 18 month contract, anyone else right now is a huge risk, Moyes knows the club inside out, he is a far better Manager than Dyche.\nFinally the old saying never go back, well Moyes did at West Ham and landed them a European trophy, bringing players in like Ward Prouse, Kudos and the likes.\nYou only have to look at West Ham under Moyes, then after he left first time the struggles, then going back and form improving again, then dipping when they got rid of him a second time.\nIt could be anyone we bring in, but if indeed it is Moyes, I believe we have made a very good choice, bring Carsley in as his number two for the longer term.\nOthers will not want Moyes and that’s fine whoever is on their wish list, I am certainly in the bring Moyes back corner, someone who will give us our identity back, and unite the fans, team and club.\nJust my opinion.\n11 Posted 10/01/2025 at 13:43:35\nI well remember a journalist asking him at his Utd presser what it meant to become Utd manager.\nHis reply...\"it means I can go out to try and win games\".\nThe man is a fucking snake.\n12 Posted 10/01/2025 at 13:47:51\nI don’t think it’s a desperation appointment at all, I think the motivating factor at this present time for TFG is who will keep us in the division short term and I agree with Ian, Moyes is a safer bet than Potter.\nWe may have to offer him a 2 year contract but that doesn’t mean we have to keep him for 2 years, or we may offer him something upstairs instead, who knows. That’s the nature of the beast.\nStaying up is absolutely everything at this present moment.\n14 Posted 10/01/2025 at 13:51:50\n15 Posted 10/01/2025 at 13:53:54\nIf it was the summer I would totally agree with a manager for the longer term, but the situation we are in now, I think Moyes is the safest option.\nHow about a poll Mike\nYes or no Moyes.\n16 Posted 10/01/2025 at 13:54:29\n17 Posted 10/01/2025 at 13:54:35\nPersonally my issue is the way he and Utd screwed the club with their “tapping up” approach and I would prefer someone other than Moyes.\nThat said realistically the priority for the next 6 months is to stay in the PL I am not sure what alternatives there are so I would be prepared to give him a 6 month interim contract and then employ a new manager in the summer\n18 Posted 10/01/2025 at 13:54:42\nThere are almost no managers that don't come without baggage from previous clubs. Remember Martinez was an upcoming manager when he took over. How did that work out? Then Koeman straight from a good Southampton side. Another disaster. Since Moyes left we have tried every type of manager there is. Yet none of them did the job anywhere near as well a Moyes did.\nThe same manager who almost got relegated with Forest last season is now being lauded as a genius because Forest are in the top four this season. Yet they have even less possession of the ball than we do. How does that work? All I want is Everton to still be in the PL when we kick off in the new stadium next season and I don't care who the manager is that does it. Is that too much to ask for? Apparently for some people it is.\n19 Posted 10/01/2025 at 13:56:24\nNot a time to take chances on unknown, possibly good young managers with no experience of the Premier.\nNo guarantees with anyone, but Moyes has the knowledge and experience needed at this time.\nIf we were higher up the table it would be a definite no from me, but needs is must and he has a good, if not better chance of keeping us in the league as anyone.\nIf we are still in this league next season TFG can then judge how he has done and if he's not good enough he will be gone.\nNot seen or heard of any better options on here or from any other media sources so he seems the obvious choice.\n20 Posted 10/01/2025 at 13:57:23\nHe took us from relegation battling to challenging most years for European places!! Wouldn’t most of us love that kind of progress over the next 4-5 years?! Yes, he said some silly things when he left to United but clearly he was desperate to ingratiate himself with them.\nHe’s not what I want long term but short term it’s hard to see many available managers who’d want to come and could hit the ground running.\nHe’s a decent bet to get us over the line hopefully and unless he does exceptional work TFG can pay him off this summer and get someone more inspiring to usher in the new era.\n22 Posted 10/01/2025 at 13:58:25\n23 Posted 10/01/2025 at 13:59:51\nI don't despise Moyes I just don't want him anywhere near Everton FC.\nMoyes started the plucky little Everton taking a knife to a gunfight mantra that has stuck with us.\nI want a manager that brings a bazooka to a gunfight.\nIf we go back to Moyes then sadly not much has changed since the dark and gloomy period of Bill Kenwright.\nWorst of all is that if he is appointed then it will split the fanbase yet again.\n24 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:00:51\nMy prediction is that Moyes will be shocked by the \"talent\" he has to work with. He won't have a Bowen to bail us out. I hope he was watching last night because I thought we were woeful, even against poor opposition. A good PL team would have ripped Peterborough to pieces.\nI'd have sooner us have gone for Carsley or taken a punt on Mourinho for the heck of it.\nI'll support Moyes, if it is him but I've got a feeling it isn't going to turn out well.\n25 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:01:44\n26 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:02:29\n27 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:03:51\nMoyes is a twat.\nThis is a disaster.\n28 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:03:59\n29 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:04:12\nWe're looking because we aren't higher and because we have a real scenario where we could fall into relegation.\n30 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:05:41\n31 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:05:51\n32 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:09:46\nWe were on a 2 week all inclusive in Kos with the kids and were in Europe longer.\nCouldnt stand Moyes after the semi final debacle against Liverpool. They were on their arse and there for the taking with a third choice goalkeeper and we were on a decent run. We went in at half time one up, and in the second half Fellaini was never allowed to cross the halfway line, we invited pressure and lost.\nKnife to a gunfight, what a mentality. It may be true, but why give up before you start.\nVery disappointed if they give him the gig.\n33 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:13:39\nMoyes will hopefully bring an improvement that takes us to mid table (big deal), this is very short of our ambition but truly an improvement on the current standards. Probably see Moyes as a 'stepping stone' to a more ambitious manager.\n34 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:14:45\nThere are only 20 premier league clubs and jobs here don’t come around often. Add to that Dyche was on £5m a year and we’ve been a constant in the top flight for half a century. I cannot imagine TFG has not spoken to other managers but can only guess if these managers have said no, then they have aimed too high and/or didn’t cast the net wide enough. Moyes would a desperation appointment given they have been looking at buying Everton for months. Unless they thought they could muddle through with Dyche to the summer and he called their bluff first.\nWe’re not in the relegation zone and I firmly believe we will stay up. This reminds me a bit like the panic of appointing Allardayce to ‘save us’ when we were not going down in any case. He just got several £m for doing bugger all and spent £50m on Walcott and Tosun. A new guy coming in would know the only aim this season is to stay up - there are worse teams below us. Tick that box and he’s got easy credit in the bank to move onto next seasons, with a spanking new stadium.\nThis squad, if it was a bit more attacking with some belief and confidence can win games and finish around 14th imo. A fit McNeil would make a difference in itself and he may be back for Villa. The likes of Armstrong, O’Brian and Patterson showed they can actually play, if given a chance. We do have a little depth.\nGetting a new man in now is a fantastic opportunity for TFG to bring hope and optimism back to Goodison. This would lift the players as well. Getting Moyes in, I just cannot imagine how stupid that would be. Have they not taken any kind of feedback from supporters groups at all? They must surely know there’s a not too small portion of the fan base that don’t want him near the club.\n36 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:16:06\n37 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:17:41\nNigel @ 5, name me one so called top team Moyes beat, away from Goodison? His record is horrendous as was most of the football produced under his tutelage.\nI cannot stand the two faced, snake in the grass. I cannot understand how anyone can possibly think he is a safe pair of hands. Ask Sunderland fans if they consider him a safe pair of hands\nWe can probably wave goodbye to Ndiaye now too. He has far too much flair to fit into a Dour Dave team.\nA very disappointing first managerial appointment from TFG group\n38 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:19:44\n39 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:21:19\nIn the medium term, Jesus Christ himself couldn't get much of a tune out of this squad, so it's all about player recruitment, rather than manager recruitment.\nIn the long term, we need a solid platform to build on, and that platform will take at least the two years that Moyes will be contracted to us.\n40 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:22:34\n41 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:24:36\nThis appointment is being made at a time of crisis.\nIt is not like the circumstances in which Brighton appointed Hurzeler or indeed when we appointed Martinez after Moyes.\nIt is more like the circumstances in which we and other clubs have appointed Allardyce - and we appointed Benitez and Dyche.\nWe are in a real fix.\nA really talented manager like McKenna is not going to come now. He might have come I'm summer after survival was assured but he won't come now. He would also like Thomas Frank be waiting on the much more enticing Spurs job.\nWe might be able to appoint a Carsley, Rohl or other - but the risk then to the Friedkins is extremely high.\nThe sort of manager you want now, is the sort of manager who will follow Moyes if he does a good job and the Friedkins stabilise the finances.\n42 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:25:19\nIt's beyond parody to think we're getting a spanking new stadium in an iconic location with a reasonable chance of the first league game being in the championship.\nThen to top it off the new owners believe Moyes is the answer.\nSometimes you just have to laugh.\n43 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:27:28\n44 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:29:37\nI think you might need therapy!\nMy biggest concern is that TFG should’ve had plans B, C, D etc lined up already. Clearly they didn’t and they’ve hit the panic button and gone for what they probably see as a safe option. I’m not sure I share their assessment of Moyes, it seems a little risky to me.\nAs for ‘taking a knife to a gunfight’. I hated that statement as much as anyone; however, this season, Dyche has been taking a dessert spoon. An actual knife would be an upgrade…\n45 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:32:16\n46 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:32:19\nIf you’re reading this Davie, are you sure you know what you’re doing?\n‘Progressive’ was a word I was searching for earlier as crucial for the new manager.\nBut the Google meaning example says ‘a progressive decline in popularity’\nSo we may have a progressive manager after all. We’ll win the FA Cup of course.\n47 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:32:58\nWill (or should) he be able to get more out of this squad (i.e. find a better balance between defence and attack?) than Dyche? I think so.\nWere we likely to attract a more, on the face of it, 'exciting' appointment from those names mentioned (Iraola; Frank) and entice them to leave a secure role in exchange for a relegation battle? Behave.\nFans are being overly emotive about Moyes meaning a lack of objectivity.\n\"Those painful 11 years\" Michael? It had its peaks and troughs but overall thats not how I recall it and certainly not compared with the last 11 years.\nIf measured *only* in trophy terms, then, yes, Moyes' last spell was a 'failure' and he *did* fall short on those occasions when opportunity was knocking but the Club and it's immediate needs are very different now.\nOn balance, I think replacing Dyche with Moyes gives us a better chance of getting to BMD as a Premier League club which is all that matters.\n48 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:36:11\n2 year contract by all accounts.\nThat’s his safety net should he get potted before and he will get paid off. Oh to be a premier manager 🙈\nIf he returns we simply have to get behind him. We need to get back to basics and start winning games again.\nOur only priority has to be staying in the league.\nForget any ‘ambition’ we simply need a couple of steady years to build us back up.\nMy first coaching session would focus on how to pass the ball to your teammates who are 3 yards away!!!\nStart with the basics 😁\n49 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:37:11\nNo manager will ever be good enough for many of our fans.\nWhile we are at it where are those ‘Sack The Board’ banners?\n50 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:38:36\nI thought my bulk purchase of M.O.B. Tee-shirts was a financial folly, your post gives me some hope of getting a return on my investment, over a dozen years after I bought them.:) I might even get a better price for them now, seeing as they're retro too.\n51 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:38:59\nSo, not greatly enamoured by the idea of Moyes, but willing to accept it and to get 100% behind him. It could be Mourinho and then heaven help us all.\n52 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:39:52\nIt would be nice to be anywhere near an FA Cup Final or the Champions League spots these days.\n53 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:39:57\n54 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:40:15\n55 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:42:24\n56 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:43:31\nWhat I find incredible is that TFG have taken on a near £600m investment and have run due diligence for several months and this is the situation we find ourselves in. It really doesn’t put them in a good light and already worries me that they don’t have a clue, barely 3 weeks in. It’s not to be forgotten there are Roma fans protesting against them.\nYou’d have thought they would have a plan A, B, C etc given the manager is such an important position. Even if they initially wanted Dyche to stay in place to season end, surely there would have been a back up plan, a manager tapped up to move in earlier if needed. Moyes is obviously a desperation move as he’s available and been with us before. That doesn't qualify him to come back however.\n[Potentially] putting in place a manager, who from day 1 will split the fan base, isn’t a clever move. Regardless of how well (or not) Moyes does, there will be a lot of fans turned off until he’s gone.\nFor several other reasons to those Michael lists, I don’t want the guy back. With us he was two faced and only wanted the money. I clearly remember in 2008, having failed after fawning himself to Spurs, he held the club to ransom to get a 5-year £4m/year contract (up from his previous £1.5m/year) to be one of the best paid managers in world football. He then moaned about the players being paid too much. He then just ran his contract down. This at a time when he well know we were skint. Him and Kenwright were a proper pair. I respect him for his early years but he showed his true colours in the latter years.\nThanks but no.\n57 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:44:40\nMOYES back to West Ham, European trophy. Some returns are better than the first time. Just need to hope Moyes Mk2 is better.\n58 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:45:12\n59 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:45:41\nI won't get out the bunting if he returns but our goal this season is survival. Then, with the finances sorted and a fresh manager (hopefully) next season we can start becoming a team that many of us would like to watch.\nGrudgingly, I have to acknowledge that Moyes' record also includes avoiding relegation. And he would certainly be fired up for the forthcoming game against West Ham.\n(Grits teeth)\n60 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:46:50\n61 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:47:09\n62 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:49:41\nFew if any would choose Moyes given a blank canvas ( start of a new season; currently sat mid table PL secure).\nWe would all want a more modern, forward thinking, progressive manager with fresh ideas, and a modern brand of football.\nWe are not in that moment, and our canvas has relegation staring at us and the financial abyss that would follow.\nThe only thing that matters right now is survival.\nNo experienced PL manager would join us now. Anything else is a bigger risk. Iriola made an awful start and was nearly sacked at Bournemouth for example.\nI didn’t enjoy the Moyes football ( tho prefer it to Dycheball) and I have griping thoughts over the way he left Everton and some of the actions and words thereafter.\nBut we have to suck it up right now, take the best of the worst options, because we are where we are just now.\n12 months forward, in Bramley Moore ( hopefully), then we can start to think and plan differently ( sorry Davey we have a better option…).\nIf it is Moyes, or whoever it is, then I urge us all to get behind the team and help secure our PL survival. Our away support is fantastic, Goodison has been flat for a while. We have to play our part again.\n63 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:49:52\n64 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:50:49\n65 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:54:31\n100% agree!\n66 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:57:38\n67 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:58:11\n68 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:58:19\nI never said anything about winning against top teams away from Goodison. They are not our peers though are they. Michael said he never beat any of the top teams, I said that’s not true, it’s not, correct me if I’m wrong.\nThe football was unattractive, I don’t disagree but needs must at this present time, our squad is poor.\n‘ I cannot stand the two faced, snake in the grass’. Therein lies the real issue, it was the way he left wasn’t it? again needs must. Don’t cut your nose off to spite your face.\n‘Ask Sunderland fans’ I have, lots of them and the overriding opinion was that Moyes was the least of their problems, probably the worst squad I have ever seen in the premiership. No Mackem I know blamed Moyes for their relegation, he should never even have taken the job, a live hand grenade.\nI refer you to West Ham, twice in the relegation zone, twice safe and much more recent.\n‘His record was horrendous’ - actually much better than Dyche.\nThat’s the end of Ndiaye- rubbish.\nIf you don’t like him then that’s fine but for me survival in the Premier League outweighs everything else in the short term and he has form for achieving that.\n69 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:58:47\nI have had enough of dour football, I don't want more.\nWho is advising our new owners? It must be someone who hasn't got a clue about football.\nWe would be better off sticking with Baines and Coleman until someone with a football brain becomes available.\nIt seems like we are experts at choosing crap journeyman managers.\n70 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:59:19\nHe left us for Man Utd, so he's a snake! Lets get real.\nThe Prem. is an unfair competition, PSR gave the usual top clubs even more advantage over us poor sods now in the bottom half of the division.\nYou now cant buy the very best players and if you are lucky enough to find and develop a quality younger player he's off to you know where. Its very tough for any manager in that senario.\nWe simply must stay in this division now if its only for the money, they will have sounded out other managers you can bet on that.\nMoyes will do an ok job with the tools he's been given and deserves our full support for the next 18 months.\n71 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:59:22\n\"Moyes said that Sunderland was in a \"very difficult situation\" and emphasized that the club would need to work hard to avoid relegation. He also mentioned that his objective was to stabilize the team and improve its performances, although he was candid about the fact that the squad needed significant strengthening and improvement.\nMoyes also noted that Sunderland’s primary goal was to stay in the Premier League, recognizing that the club had been involved in a relegation battle for several years prior to his appointment. He expressed a strong sense of determination and belief that he could help the team overcome its challenges, although he admitted that the task ahead would not be easy.\nIn summary, Moyes understood the threat of relegation and was focused on avoiding it, but also acknowledged the difficulties and challenges that lay ahead. Unfortunately for him and Sunderland, the club was relegated to the Championship at the end of the 2016–17 season.\"\nFor all the thoughts around positive player recruitment (over many years), we also had to endure - Per Koldrup, Simon Davies, Andy VDM, Bilyaletdinov, Magaye Guaye, The Strac, Royston Drenthe\n72 Posted 10/01/2025 at 14:59:48\nWhilst I'm happy to absolve him of blame for the cup final defeat against Chelsea - They were superior in every position and the conspiracist in me thinks We were never going to be allowed to progress in THAT CL tournament. I agree entirely with your sentiments. In fact I don't think you go far enough.\nYou don't even mention that shameful, shameful day Wigan came to Goodison and played us off the park. The humiliating surrenders against the top teams. The mental scars inflicted on youngsters who traveled wide eyed with excitement to Lisbon and Bucharest. Moyes could give me 3-4 stone but I swear I would happily have settled things with him in the Boleyn car park when I arrived late after a nightmare drive from Mussleborough to East London, only to discover that he thought it was a good idea to play without a striker.\nAs Uncle Bill would say \"We had some good times\". The Carsley derby, The memorable Gosling winner, but if you blinked you missed them. That glass ceiling seemed to get lower and lower every time he spoke about playing against top clubs.\nSplit fan base ? I suspect the waiting list for season tickets will disappear overnight if this fella gets the gig.\n73 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:00:00\nSunderland were confirmed to be relegated to the EFL Championship for the first time in ten years on 29 April 2017, after a 1–0 loss to AFC Bournemouth, marking the first relegation of Moyes' career. After the match, he stated that he would like to remain as manager. However, on 22 May, one day after the end of the Premier League season, Moyes resigned.\nOne of the more printable views of a current Sunderland message board:\nOverall because its a London club[West Ham] he’ll be seen to be a success but on the whole an outdated manager who will fail at whatever club he’s at next and he’s 100% no saviour for any club either\n74 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:01:03\n75 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:01:08\nLike Michael I despise the man, I despise his negative one dimensional tactics, I despise the way he left us and his comments about Evertonians. Like injured players, who somehow become better players when they're injured, Moyes has somehow become a wonderful manager since he left us. I suspect 90% of fans were happy when he left us - a similar figure to the number of Hammers fans when he left there as well from what I understand. Apart from Cahill I cannot think of a single player who improved under his coaching.\nHow is appointing Moyes a move forward? I will always support Everton but I will not applaud or support Moyes and will look forward to the day he leaves (assuming his dreadful appointment is confirmed).\nMOYES OUT\nHow\n76 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:04:49\n77 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:07:28\nYou're right. Apologies. Writing dross. Brain a little fuzzy here today (just back from travelling overseas). A reason but not an excuse.\nMoyes out!\n79 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:10:01\nThe \"glass ceiling\" between us and what was then a \"big four\" was clearly in our heads, put there by the scheming Moyes who kept our mighty warchest fit for the likes of Madrid and United down the back of the sofa.\nBut in all seriousness, he did a good job. Most of our issues last time he was here were down to decisions at boardroom level, along with Kenwright selling up 20 years too late.\nEven today however we have to face the inequality of treatment and in funds available between the rest of the league (including us) and the \"big 6\" (previously \"big 4\"). Leicester (for example) only won two trophies before succumbing to relegation.\nIssues of Everton and other clubs not winning trophies/occupying top spots are down to problems with English football, regardless of the manager.\n80 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:10:23\n81 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:11:48\n82 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:11:59\nHe will hopefully get respect off the squad and maybe give individual attention as opposed to what they've been used to under Dyche.\nMaybe allow a little freedom of expression, be allowed mistakes and foster a strong team ethic.\nHe has a wealth of Premier league experience, and he might even have a book full of scouting people he knows that he can put to use.\nAs others have said he regularly had to sell his best players and was not always provided with the money to replace them.\nI've said maybe,hopefully and might in this comment because unlike the experts among us who write what appear to be cast iron truth as if they've been informed on a personal level by Dan Friedman himself, I am happy to say that as far as this whole saga is being played out, I know the square root of fuck all.\nIf it comes to pass that it is Moyes I would be perfectly happy with it\n83 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:12:16\nIt actually makes me sick.\n84 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:13:19\nBut who else is going to come in and run the asylum.\nPeople we are a joke club with the worst squad I can remember and until we have a complete and utter clear out nothing changes sadly !!!!\n85 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:13:52\nplus he has an affection and bond with the club, and knows everyone. For where we are, and the job that needs doing, It's the sensible choice. Let's not forget, this is a hospital pass of a job. I't s worn down that tough little nut SD quick smart.\n86 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:20:44\nI would like TFG to actually look at the team and the problems that exist and then find a manager who can actually come in, win over the squad and give the players confidence to do new things in an effective way. Mourinho and the other managers mentioned in another thread don't appear to me to fit that bill. What I really don't want is for some retired footballer who hung up his boots a couple of years back a la Lampard, Rooney, etc. to be given the job and sadly that also goes for Ferguson.\nCarsley could be an option, if for no other reason that he is passionate, has a battling mentality and gets teams to play fluid football at times. However, Southgate should be ruled out as he lost at least one Euros because he was to cautious like Moyes.\n87 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:24:15\n88 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:25:07\n89 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:25:23\nMoyes has become a journeyman who had very little success at Everton 20 years ago and even less success since then.\nSo why the backward step.\nMay as well go with Biansey, Rooney or Tom Cleverley if we want to gamble like this.\nCome on Freidkin & Co. Get real !!!!!\n90 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:28:01\n91 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:28:18\nIf Moyes keeps us up, they can move him on with his bonus and do the reset they were planning on.\nIt’s a big risk, but keeping Dyche when he’d clearly checked out, would be a much bigger one.\n92 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:29:05\nIt still seems to me there’s a small chance that we go a different direction. Nowadays one or two people can plant stories in the newspapers and make something seem a done deal when it’s not.\nMoyes was before my time, so I don’t have the emotional history of living through that era and his leaving us for greener pastures. But based on his record alone, it seems a sensible choice. And as others have said, it’s also entirely possible no other reasonable candidate wants to take a chance on us.\nAt this point getting one or two signings over the line is just as if not more important right now than the manager.\n93 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:32:47\nThat's the highest in the last 25 years except for Ancelotti (1.53 and 43.1%). And Moyes managed that despite taking on a poor, ageing team that had come 16th the previous season. And yet people seem obsessed with some of his (relatively mundane) soundbites?!\nI doubt he'll do so well or have as much time second time round but we could do alot worse.\n95 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:32:50\nBut whether it was always in him, or it developed over time, he became a more and more conservative manager, and the second half of his tenure was broadly one of stagnation.\nAnd, while I don't hate Moyes, I have the same sense of despair and frustration at the idea of him being re-hired. It's the epitome of lack of ambition. If the argument is \"we need to stay in the division, however miserable the football\" then we may as well have kept Dyche until the summer.\nThis set of players is not great, but neither it as awful as it's seemed. It's not like before the season we were thinking \"oh, Bournemouth and Nottm Forest have a much better squad of talent than us\". We have enough to be competent, if competently managed.\nEvery managerial hire is a risk. But I really wish we'd take the risk of reaching for something better, more positive, more ambitious, even at the danger of that failing, than one more going for the least imaginative, least ambitious, most status quo maintaining hire possible.\n96 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:33:03\nI say Let me be disappointed again.\nLet me ‘feed the yak’, let me sing about ‘the best little Spaniard we know’ or debate with any football fan that our left side is as good as any in the league.\nThe Fiorentina game we failed in but my god, what a night, what a game and what an atmosphere. The other failures mentioned, oh what trips and memories they still provided us with. Like it or not, we are fighting bigger dogs since the 90’s and our decline and we failed many times in the past at the big moments but right now, we are getting beat up by shitzus and sausage dogs that big moments don’t exist for us.\nAm I filled with excitement at the sense of intrigue and positive front foot football that a Fonseca or ‘insert name of mostly unknown foreign manager’ that such an appointment would bring ? No.\nBut we are a basket case of a club atm. Years of surviving by the skin of our teeth, points deductions, Psr issues, new owners who have their own issues at Roma and a sub par team that is going to lose plenty of players out of contract this summer and possibly its brightest young player to a big team in Branthwaite.\nAny manager willing to come here right now, is likely not of the calibre many would want. When players are apparently choosing Ipswich, Nottingham Forest and Leicester before us, we have to accept that right now, we are not the ‘big 4’ team of the past or even a team looking at the European conference league. We are so far behind others that unless you are a blue, we are not an attractive proposition.\nThe membership of the premier league is our most attractive selling point and that is under massive threat.\nWe shouldn’t accept mediocrity but just like when we appointed dyche, certain situations require certain solutions. There is to much to risk right now for the new owners to risk an untested manager in the premier league. Yes there are some successes, there are way more failures and we have had plenty of our own since Moyes.\nWhen building a house, you get the groundwork craftsmen in first and when the foundation is solid, you then start to look at how to make it sparkle. Right now the foundations are crumbling.\nMoyes may simply be the best we can get in quickly to steady the ship, a phrase many will hate but may have to swallow.\n97 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:34:47\nThe consensus is that Moyes will achieve that.\nThats ALL that is important presently, premiership survival.\nAt the end of the season TFG can look at how he fared, how we played and should they keep him and roll the dice in the Summer transfer market.\nIn the summer we can look at alternatives if the fit was not right.\nYou have to understand TFG have no problems with Managers contracts they just sack if they don't deliver ie Roma ?\nTFG are still business people behind the scenes and will want results.\nIf you deliver you in, if you dont then theres the door. I can live with that if it gets improves the team and the club.\n98 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:35:30\nExactly right Mike, just because he signs a 2 year contract doesn’t mean we have to keep him for 2 years.\n99 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:36:29\nonly Moyes can save us. The West Ham fans who hate him with a vengeance must think we’ve lost leave of our senses.\n101 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:37:34\nThe FA Cup Final against Chelsea was a game we could have won IF\nThe referee Webb, hadn’t booked Hibbert after 8 minutes for a foul on Malouda. Hibbert spent the rest of the half crapping himself and frightened to tackle.\nWe were without long-term injury victims Phil Jagielka, Mikel Arteta, Yakubu Aiyegbeni, Victor Anichebe and Nuno Valente. Half the team and the spine of the team. It’s easy to just look at the result and not the reason.\nI’m not happy seeing Moyes drag his sorry arse back to Goodison but I can see the reasoning. We need to continue with our defensive solidity, just attack occasionally and maybe, heaven forbid, try a shot in goal. If Carsley came as well to learn the job of managing in the Premier League I could accept it easier.\nPS. Howard, Coleman, Hibbert, Jags, Distin, Lescott, Baines, Arteta, Osman, Pienaar, Yakubu, Cahill…..every one of those players would walk into our present team and that side would qualify for Europe. Though it pains me to say it, Moyes built a good side there.\n102 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:37:36\n‘It’s not what we want but..’ line has been used for Benitez, Lampard and Dyche with predictable results.\nIt is embarrassing and humiliating to the club that we are considering this professional failure to lead us to BMD,\nIt is also a regressive and divisive appointment which a large portion of the fan base will completely reject … again\n103 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:39:58\n104 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:41:00\nMoyes has been out of the game since his second stint as Hammers boss came to an end in May. He has been linked with numerous jobs and fielded some approaches this season - but for now, is content to enjoy a break. \"I don't consider myself done yet but I am certainly enjoying some time off,\" he told BBC Sport. \"The one thing I won't do is put any manager under pressure personally, because I don't believe in it. I have not liked it when I have been in that position myself. \"We are all getting a little bit older and I have to make sure I am doing the right thing for myself. \"Football is in my blood. It has been since I was a boy. I love watching football and I have enjoyed my career. \"If there is another part to it, so be it. But I would only want it to be a good part. I wouldn't want to be coming in and doing something which is very difficult. \"I don't want to be at the bottom of the league and fighting relegation which I have had a few times, so we will see how things go.\"\nThat final comment is the one that bothers me the most, as Everton are fighting relegation, and it is a very difficult situation to manage.\n105 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:42:36\n106 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:46:08\n107 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:47:27\nI'm not mad about going back to Moyes but you can't claim he is a bad manager. He has shown that he can take a average mid table team and have them play above their level and battle in around the top 6.\n108 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:47:54\n109 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:48:37\n110 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:52:05\nI just now found out, living in a bubble, that Dyche was sacked.\nSo, I reeling from this information overload.\nDyche had to go. Simple.\nMoyes, if named, is just a disaster. I don't care if he has success, he's not the man for the job. We've now swallowed every bit of pride we ever had.\nDoes no one remember his smug attitude when he left for Manchester? He's comments about Roberto? \"He'll figure out how that club works.\" [paraphrase, can't be assed to look up the exact use of words]\nHe was a complete dick, shed us for what he believed to be greener pastures with a condescending attitude, and kind of shit on us on the way out the door.\nHis football isn't overly pretty, I don't see how he's any imporovement over Dyche in the end to be honest. I don't mind a conservative approach to the game, but Mr. knife to gunfight isn't going to overly improve us in the least.\nThis is a nightmare. This is Benitez mark 2, this is awful.\nFind somebody, anybody, other than Moyes please.\nLee Carsley, up or down, would be fine with me. And if you don't like that call due to Carsley's lack of coaching experience, I'd remind you of Mikel Arteta not having \"experience\" and going to Arsenal. Yes, he coached under Pep. But Lee coached the freaking England National Team, so how do you define \"experience\"?\nPick anyone if you don't agree with me. Anyone. Moyes is simply NOT the answer.\nTony Marsh, somewhere, is reeling in pain. If Tony is no longer with us, he's rolled over in his grave.\nThis is AWFUL. Just no.\n111 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:52:08\nThe people slagging him off would probably have loved us to have been in for someone like that Amorim fella at United. That's going well for them.\nHe has proven at all clubs that have given him more than a season or less that he will do better than most and improve their lot.\nWe'd all love to win the league. Who are these managers that can come in and do that at any club regardless of any other factors? They don't exist.\nQuit whining about not getting the better of one of the best 4 sides in the Champions League that year with a squad that had no right to even be there having barely stayed up the year before and then having lost Rooney for a down payment of just 10 million quid.\nIt's silly given the fact that no other manager, despite having better resources, has managed to even get there with us since the competition was created back in the 90's.\nMoyes in.\n112 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:53:04\nI 100% agree that his record away at the big teams was not acceptable. Hopefully, he’s now had ample opportunity to reflect on this and his approach will change. I’m pretty sure West Ham turned Arsenal over at the Emirates.\n113 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:54:47\nIf he comes, I’ll support the team and wish him well.\nIf he doesn’t, I’ll support the team and forget all about him.\nThe best part of his time here, were some of the comments on TW by John Daley and Eugene Ruane, that made me laugh out loud.\n114 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:54:55\n115 Posted 10/01/2025 at 15:57:46\n116 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:00:19\n117 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:02:15\nMy view is that the next Permanent appointment TFG make is a show of intent. If that intent is Moyes then it is unambitious and a backward step.\nYes he stabilised us and early days that was good, but he almost singlehandedly changed the Everton psyche to be \"That'll do\" rather than \"Should do better\".\nPeople see 5th as an achievement but to win nothing is not.\nIt showed very quickly when Martinez took Moyes team and got more points in 1 season than he ever managed. Beat top teams, which he never managed.\nMoyes as a stop-gap til the end of the season, I will just about accept. Into BMD as a returning king of Everton. Not for me.\nBMD deserves a star. Everton deserve a star - not an average manager who is way past his average best.\nPlease remember it is 12 years since he left us and he was a dwindling force then.\n118 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:03:10\n119 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:04:09\n1. He's got half the fan base against him before he's even took a training session.\n2. Is he really a long term replacement? Surely not, yet if he does a good job keeping us up then what ?\nYou have another decision to make ?\n3. The fans are crying out for something new, fresh, forward thinking, progressive & uniting not devisive or sentimental.\nUnless it is an absolute certainty that stay up or go down he leaves at the end of the season then it's a no ! Even then I'd look at every single other option first.\nTHIS MUST ONLY BE A LAST RESORT.\nYet seems like same old Everton. No real ambition, no long term strategy.\nThe optimism from Dyche leaving has.been sucked away in 24hrs by this news.\n120 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:04:46\nI was in favour of a replacement, but the speed of events means there is no one in place, so not a well planned and orchestrated succession.\nI didn't hate Dyche the person, but I had come to really dislike the whole package of him, his coaching, tactics, and some of his press statements.\nBut here we are, knee jerk appointment coming, missed Potter, Jose was never happening, so what's on the cards at short notice without a huge comp outlay that wipes out psr and any transfer budget?\nMoyes was on record saying he was not up for a relegation fight, he'd wait for the right appointment, what's he saying now then?\nHe won't take a 6 month job, who would, is he the man you want for the next 2 yrs?\nTfg have jumped in now, so have to put this back on track asap, not the most professional start methinks..\n121 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:07:44\nMoyes should never be considered for any post at Everton - he was never good enough, still isn't and more to the point he threw Everton under the Man Utd bus, just to fill his own pockets, because he was never going to fill Ferguson's boots. Bastard!!\nHe is now out of work, probably out of pocket and about to take the piss out of Everton Fuck Off!!\n122 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:10:28\nD.Moyes left Everton 15yrs ago in not so pleasant circumstances. Since then he was with Man Utd for 10months, won nothing, Real Sociedad for 12months won nothing, Sunderland that ended up Relegated, went to West Ham 2017/2018 and left, went back to West Ham on 2019/ 2024 and in 2023 won the Europa Conference League Final, that year West Ham finished the league in 14th place. So what makes him an ideal candidate for Everton.\nWe either look for another Dyche coach or another more pragmatic coach as surly all managers and coaches study the methods of attacking and defending with one emphasizing over one or the other but they still understand both sides of the game.\nWe should get a coach in for the future , continuing going to the past coaches is not working.\n123 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:11:57\nWhen it comes to managers their opinions as a silent majority are almost irrelevant. Apart from the obvious need for points what really counts now is the usually strident opinion of the vocal minority on social media.\nWith Moyes in the frame we are already seeing him undermined by negativity on here and elsewhere. After a couple of defeats the negativity will spread very quickly, the mainstream media will report increasing pressure on the manager and before we can say ‘he needs to go’ we will be in yet another managerial crisis.\nIt is of course all very entertaining but also quite depressing.\n124 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:12:15\n125 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:13:01\nNever go back?\nDM went back to West Ham and won them a European Trophy for goodness sake.\nHe inherited a shocking situation at Goodison last time and stabilised us and made us top half of the table.\nIn fact I often used to say we always top, or near the top of our league within a league in the PL.\n126 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:17:55\nWhen Moyes was at Everton I remember all the criticism of him on TW by certain individuals for only getting us to 5th or 6th in the league pretty much every year. He did a fantastic job with very little money and recruited some fabulous footballers for bargain prices. But he never got the respect he deserved from some of the fans.\nIt seems to me there is a cohort of Everton fans, particularly on TW, who have a completely unrealistic expectations as to where Everton should be at the moment. We have a very poor squad of players. I think only Pickford, Tarks and Branthwaite would get into a top half EPL side. Whoever becomes manager is going to struggle to do any better than Dyche.\nMoyes is a pragmatist and a realist, which clearly clashes with the fantasist element of our fan base who can’t accept the current reality. We need a manager with these sort of attributes to give us the best chance of staying up. Hopefully we can reach the point where we can again compete for honours but until we do let’s park the hatred hey and get on with supporting our manager, whoever it may be.\n127 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:19:01\nNick, Hibbert was booked after eight minutes, every Chelsea attack afterwards went down our right wing. FairPlay, you do acknowledge the fact that we were missing players but I can’t believe that we sat back. Chelsea were a good side and they managed to beat a depleted Everton. Webb was the villain of the piece booking Hibbert for his first foul. I was there too. Hugely disappointing result.\n128 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:20:11\n129 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:20:19\nLook elsewhere.\n130 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:23:57\n131 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:24:55\n132 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:27:55\n“ It seems to me there is a cohort of Everton fans, particularly on TW, who have a completely unrealistic expectations as to where Everton should be at the moment. We have a very poor squad of players. I think only Pickford, Tarks and Branthwaite would get into a top half EPL side. Whoever becomes manager is going to struggle to do any better than Dyche.”\nRespect your opinion, Andy but two things there. Firstly, people are allowed to aim a bit higher than ground level. It’s called hope. Secondly, Forest finished well below us last season and are joint second. Villa under the nettle licker similar and same with Newcastle under Bruce. Brighton, Brentford and now Bournemouth (jeez) have been promoted through the divisions. None of whom have been allowed to spend crazy money. Why should Everton, a point ahead of an average Championship side be so admonished? I would suggest it’s 1. The management/managers and 2. The culture of the club (accepting second best) rather than having “the worst squad” etc etc. It just doesn’t make sense otherwise.\n133 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:30:12\nOn the same basis, how many dished out you fat b to Rooney when he returned playing for Utd, kissing the badge, once a Blue and all that, but then stood out of their seats applauding, when Rooney returned and fired a hatrick in against West Ham, that ridiculous half way lob over the West Ham keeper.\nRooney and Moyes left a sour taste on certain things they said and did, but I still think we need Moyes more than he needs us.\nA lot of the players we have at Everton now is a far better set then that Moyes inherited on his first stint at Everton.\nIf Moyes comes in, I will have a sportsman bet, he picks more points up than Potter.\nThat’s my final say on the matter, until an announcement is made,\n134 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:30:18\nMichael, you are definitely a glass half empty man. In fact I'd say you're drinking the dregs. That Moyes got us into the Champions League in the first place (with Rooney gone the season before), was a minor miracle and he will defo get us moving up the table. He never made many mistakes in the transfer market and when I look at the players he brought in over the years, like Coleman, Baines, Pienaar and Arteta, I for one would love to see him back. Certainly better than the shite we've been served up recently.\nI would love him to bring Lee Carsley with him too, possibly with a view to him being a long term successor.\n135 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:32:34\n136 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:34:18\nHe's just a relic of a bygone age.\nAnd the idea of walking out into our shiny new stadium this fall with a new team and an old, recycled manager just appalls me.\nI got the Friedkins totally wrong on this one and I am deeply disappointed.\n137 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:34:36\nSo much changes over time and the circumstances of then and now, the Everton teams of then and now, the position the club finds itself between then and now have huge variables. Its like the GOAT argument that is always entirely irrelevant, as Maradonna would now be outrun, out-muscled and outfought by someone like Conor Coady.\nWhat Moyes did last time was consistently fail to take the opportunity in front of him because he was a risk averse, defensive and miserable minded individual who would settle for the mediocre and safe option always.\nAs a fellow miserable Scot, I recognise these traits as being ingrained by Scottish society of the 70s and 80s, where success was a sign of deceit and subterfuge, creativity was divergent and being adventurous meant drinking a can of Top Deck rather than Irn Bru.\nI believe he will again miss the opportunity, only this time, it also means the entire club misses the opportunity for the grand RESET.\n138 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:35:14\n139 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:40:17\nDrogba coached, cajoled and instructed the Chelsea team and systematically bulldozed the entire Everton defense and midfield into submission. A masterclass.\n140 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:41:41\nNo manager can guarantee us survival this season. Our options are limited. Moyes, clearly, is not everyone’s choice. But he may be TFG’s. Unlike some, I don’t despise the man. ( Let’s remember this is sport/entertainment we’re talking about). A “safe pair of hands” is required to keep us up. Moyes may be as good as anyone else to achieve that. Let’s take one step at a time. TFG can always review their priorities at any time.\n141 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:44:24\n142 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:46:01\nI suspect they hoped Dyche would just get them through and with him gone they've just looked for an identikit replacement in Moyes. Not exactly the dream we were sold.\n143 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:49:15\n144 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:53:33\nFinal paragraph sums it up:\nMoyes's time at our club ran its course and it was clear by the end that he had taken Everton as far as he could about three years before he left. It would be a hugely retrograde and deeply unpopular step to bring him back, even for just a few months. If Moshiri, Marcel Brands and the Board are seriously thinking in terms of offering him any sort of deal, it would be tantamount to Allardyce Mk II and would cast the Director of Football in a very poor light indeed. Please, God, it doesn't come to that.\n145 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:53:58\nMichael I assume you put this article out as a means to do what you can to show the club how divisive this decision would be? Clever. It absolutely is divisive and an opportunity missed (again) if we go for Moyes.\nI am not going to dig him out, I actually think he did a good job for us. Please for fucks sake can we stop wheeling out the \"knife to a gunfight\" quote as a reason to lambast him? He managed us for many years, is he not allowed to make a clumsy statement in that time?\nBy all means disapprove because its a backwards step and because he is a dated manager and because you should never go back.\nI hope there is enough noise around this to deter them from this decision but who knows.\n146 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:54:05\n147 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:56:34\nHe knows the place snd a number of people still there like Seamus and Bainesy who will fell they can open up to him snd tell it how it is rather than bulldhit.\nNo one can doubt he is good at spotting good players on the cheap and knows the English leagues very well because god knows we need some quality recruits.\nHe will be determined to show the football world he still has it and will hopefully build a backup staff contingent for the future.\nHe operates well with limited budgets unlike the likes of Mourhino etc.\nThe only downside for me is his knives to a gunfight attitude towards the rich 6 but hopefully he has matured on that front.\nThe one thing I am certain about it that he will give some pride back to wearing the shirt and promoting the club unlike SD who bellyached we were a basket case with poor players every opportunity he had.\n148 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:58:50\nI was sad to see Dyche go. If he had saved us from relegation three years on the bounce, I was going to suggest we name the new stadium after him.\nAnd now it's time for me to go, I know.\n149 Posted 10/01/2025 at 16:59:06\n150 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:03:20\nBut that's EXACTLY what we did back in 2002 when we appointed Moyes!\n\"If we were higher up the table, it would be a definite no from me\"\nIf we were higher up the table, Dyche would still be our manager.\n151 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:04:36\n152 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:06:14\nMoyses M II, I'm hoping doesn't happen.\n153 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:08:41\nWhether he's a 'Sam Allardyce' appointment with a longer contract but ultimately short term, who knows. What I do know is we needed to ditch Dyche.\n154 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:08:50\nOur squad is really really weak. We need as an absolute minimum two top quality full-backs, at least one high-quality creative midfielder, and a top-quality striker. We can't buy them though because of the Moshiri legacy which has tied our financial hands behind our back.\n155 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:11:41\nWhat's the Latin for \"We'll accept any old bollocks\"?\n156 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:13:45\nAnd we can pretty much guarantee they will be half decent. When's the last time we could say that.\nMax satis nisi merdentissime.\n157 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:15:23\nHe was never my first choice long term, Sarri is; but it is a question of needs must right now until the end of the season, then we think again with more time to properly consider longer term options.\nListening to some on here, it's as if we would be stuck with him forever.\n158 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:15:50\nThe management of Everton Football Club has for years been a disaster, and the new owners appear to be continuing in that manner and have seemingly left themselves with very few options.\n159 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:21:12\nThis lot we have at the club now are proper shit. Got his work cut out for certain. I am not overjoyed at his return, should it happen, but we need to get behind him. He did a really good job at West Ham. Here's hoping... again!\n160 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:21:16\nAlan#155\nWirh you on your improvised motto.\nThe future seems to be missing in the equation.It will interesting to see the contract.\nSir Gareth could follow at this rate.\nDon Alexander confronts Moyes recently regarding Kenwright.Moye's seem to think Moshiri was the problem.\nOn that I agree with Doǹ , Moye's should never be let near Everton.\n161 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:25:02\n162 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:32:54\nWould that be the 8th, 7th (X2), 6th (X2), 5th (X2) and 4th place finishes that you grudgingly acknowledge we avoided relegation under Moyes?\n163 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:33:29\nThey obviously wouldn’t hire Moyes if we were in no danger of relegation, but this is clear and present danger and Moyes has a better chance, than a checked-out Dyche, of getting a tune out of this squad.\n164 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:34:02\n165 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:34:18\nDespite saving us from the drop 2 seasons on the bounce, we were still heading for it halfway through this season, so I would assume you are agreeing that Dyche needed to go?\nOn the basis that Dyche had to go, who else might be better qualified than Moyes for this club at the moment?\n167 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:40:57\nI actually believe some of them may be written by the same 'supporters' who've been calling for Dyche's head, week after week? What exactly did you expect? You couldn't make it up.\nMind you, never mind them, what about the leading article? Genius!\nAnyway, it seems doom-laden mediocrity remains the order of the day for us, as it was at the start of the season. Sean Dyche couldn't deliver mediocrity, and so our situation is the same, toiling near the relegation places.\nMoyes makes sense to me on a short term contract. I don't particularly like his brand of football, but it is what it is.\nGet with the program folks.\n168 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:41:17\nI have it on good authority that Dan Friedkin called up Jenny and asked \"What would Bill do?\"\n169 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:42:15\nDeliberately so Oliver.\n170 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:42:16\n171 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:44:53\nHowever, I am in complete agreement that bringing Moyes back is completely the wrong move to make. Combined with the manner and timing of the Dyche sacking, this story has me worried that the new owners are actually just a new bunch of idiots.\nAnother poster used a phrase I’m hoping doesn’t become a ToffeeWeb staple: same circus, different clowns.\n172 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:45:33\n173 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:47:14\nOf course that article was written just after Silva had departed when things weren't as dire as they are today.\nBe interesting to see Lyndon revisit that article given our current plight.\n174 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:48:30\n175 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:49:39\nAlso, for anyone thinking of not renewing their season ticket for next season for BMD, just remember one thing……Moyes will not be here forever, might even get the chop this coming summer, but giving up your season ticket just because Moyes will be manager, probably for only 18 months, is ridiculous, and you will not get it back, as there will be plenty on the waiting list who will snap it up!\nMe….i get mine on Monday, and for the rest of this season and next, I will back Moyes, but far more importantly, will be backing the team. As I say, Moyes will not be here forever, the club and the team will, and anyone giving up their season ticket will come to regret it!\n176 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:50:26\nMy personal preference would be Carsley with Baines as his number 2. These men are graduates of the modern game. Nuno Di Santo's progression at Forest is similar testimony to how the game has moved on from the Moyes/Mourhino era.\nWe are entering a new era at Bramley Moor and should do so led by the very best of new English talent. Carsley and Baines have earned their stripes working with young players at local and International level. I believe they could develop at Everton a managerial partnership not seen since Kendal and Harvey.\nHowever I do not expect our American owners to understand a single word of my statement. They are businessman after instant results, not football men intent on building a legacy for the future.\n177 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:51:09\nMoyes was also a shower of shit Rick, as proved at every disaster Moyes has overseen since leaving Everton. The guy is a walking advert for boring mediocrity\n178 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:53:18\ncos that’s the rumour I’ve……..\njust started.\n179 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:55:13\nMy Everton the Everton I love is a team, managed to win things, playing attractive football and being the envy of other fans not just for their team but the way we are run from the boardroom down, with fans known for their knowledge of the game and their sportsmanship.\nRight now we are a laughing stock, thanks to Moyes and BK, who started the rot, with their low bar standards. Bournemouth fans taking the piss showed justhow low we have sunk. We are an irrelevance. Large sections of fans of other teams have never known Everton be successful, as have are own fans born after 1995.\nTaking us back by appointing Moyes is something that will split our fan base. That is not what we expected TFG to do when Dyche was replaced but here we are by the looks of it. I hope it's all paper talk and a manager is pulled out of the hat to surprise us all. To think of Moyes managing EFC as we leave Goodison and then leading us into Bramley Moore is stomach churning. So please TFG walk away and look elsewhere, please. We are not that desperate Dan.\n180 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:55:16\nCarsley would be my choice also, with Tim Cahill in a coaching role.\n181 Posted 10/01/2025 at 17:58:38\nHe won't mess around with the defence, check, and will also be able to unlock the passion of the crowd at Goodison. Check.\nHe has recent management experience in the Premiership, taking charge at West Ham and steadying results and performance. Check.\nThat ok for you Annika? And your criteria?\n182 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:01:56\n\"Nos te accipere aliqua vetus bollocks\". or thereabouts.\n183 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:04:15\nThat's not because of Moyes, that's because of BMD, the ground he said would never be built.\n184 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:05:12\nWith Dyche, I think we would have just about been safe.\nHe's gone, a big risk as apart from a few, current player's were performing for Dyche.\nNow who knows how many will be happy or otherwise.\nWe can't bring in world class player's or managers due to finances and league position.\nWe can't keep Baines in situ, he's simply not got what it takes currently.\nHonestly given a choice between Dyche, Baines or Moyes, I see Moyes as a step in the right direction.\nAll the other failed premier league managers failed to learn lessons, failed to adapt and failed to keep their job's because performances got worse. Everyone of them (and a few have been kinked with us) would be a worse choice for where Everton are right now.\nTiming is everything. Exciting no, sensible yes. He may even turn it down.\n185 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:06:00\nThis seems to be in large part because, like Mr. Gaynes, they are American. He also keeps telling us that they are ruthless American corporate capitalists who know what they are doing in the cut-and-thrust of the Yank business world and hell they will make sure that they will get what they want.\nMessage to MG on the cultural front: there will be more than a few British people who do not really run with the idea that ruthless American corporate capitalism is a good thing for our English club. In fact, there might be one or two on here or more who have themselves been the victims of savage American corporate greed or know someone who has been on its cold receiving end.\nEvents of the last two days show how wrong Mike Gaynes has been. An equally valid view, I think, is that TFG wanted to ruthlessly see out the season, ruthlessly keep Dyche in place, ruthlessly not appoint a new CEO last week, ruthlessly save a few pennies, ruthlessly do the bare minimum for the time being, and ruthlessly let us hop along to 17th.\nWithout knowing the ins and outs of the twenty-four hours before Dyche’s sacking, more than a few on here were of the opinion that if it is to be Moyes then there is absolutely zilch planning.\nIt seems to me, that unlike Mr. Gaynes who keeps on lecturing us about what a good job TFG are doing in the eternal city, many on here do not in fact believe that the record in Rome on and off the field is a good one (some letter from some Roma fan was leapt on as the key that unlocked the door - it didn’t really read like a letter to me).\nIf – IF – Moyes steps into Dyche’s tight shoes then Thelwell (Mr. Gaynes also often lectures us that the gaffer has no say in incoming) and TFG ought to look, well, a little sheepish (lambs not lions).\nOh wow the vicissitudes of unleashed Texan capitalism. Remember, the Texan sharks know what they want and they know how to get it, they wanna destroy ……\nI think that we ought to be very cautious at this moment in time, especially if – IF – Moyes is the pick for longer than six months. We should hedge our bets for the short-term. This is all to say that TFG COULD succeed in their stewardship of our English club, but the time for “informed” large-scale super guesses is not now.\nI do have some reservations, however, about appointing someone to stop us slipping into the basement three whose team leaked 74 goals in his last season with them. That makes Marco Silva’s defensive prowess (another one of Mr. Gaynes’s recycled pet passions) look like KIT.\nIf – IF – it is to be Moyes then, needless to say, we must back him, even though, like me, there might be some who shake their head at his gall after the manner of his exit in 2013 and his wish that Marouane had earned the right to play for a big club.\n186 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:07:35\nHe absolutely will mess around with the defence and how will he unlock the passion of the crowd when so many don’t want him back? Check\nRecent management experience of a club who couldn’t wait to get rid of him. Not to mention a fan base who detested him. Check.\nClearly a good fit then. Check.\nNot to mention the fact he hates flair players. Say goodbye to Ndiaye. Check\n187 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:09:15\nHow about Moyes assisted by Carsley on a two year deal, with the idea that Carsley takes it on alone after that?\n188 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:13:41\nPlease read post 136.\n189 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:16:11\nNo he didn't, not away from home.\n190 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:17:49\nSo many don't want him back? A few keyboard warriors on here having a moan you mean. The fans who go the game will get behind him, they put the club first, which is the way it should be.\n191 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:21:15\n192 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:21:55\n‘Hates flair players’. Are you sure?\nSo he didn’t sign Pienaar or Baines or Arteta or Cahill or Yakuku or play Osman or buy Saha or Jo or Van Der Meyde etc etc etc\nBy all means be dispirited but don’t make rubbish up\n193 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:21:59\nNot true Bill.\nUtd. won the Charity Shield under Moyes.\n194 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:22:11\nI'll be more than happy for MK to delete it.\nI still feel that TFG might succeed, by the way, but small steps for the time being.\nMoyes longer-term will be an appalling choice and surely will only happen because Moyes with his high self-esteem will insist that someone of his stature must come in on a longer contract.\nI suppose TFG want to give aa new manager Monday and Tuesday to work with the squad before Wednesday's reckoning with Villa.\n195 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:28:25\nThe first set of bad results is always grim but Moyes has little to no credit in the bank for it's arrival.\nJust as we thought the Benitez appointment was the end of mad owner decisions\n196 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:32:11\nYes to a degree, with Alan Irvine as his assistant performances were somewhat more positive than when Steve Round arrived.\nThinking on it a bit more, maybe it's not a such a bad move?\nWith the UEFA coefficient and the repeat winners of our domestic trophies we have today Moyes would have had us in Europe 9 out of the 12 full seasons he was with us. No bad thing.\nFor the most part he also bought well, ok, out of favour players of the likes of Arteta would today cost ten times as much as the £2.5m we paid for him as today £15m - £20m is entry level but nevertheless he found us a core group of decent players.\nArguably we finished 5th under Martinez due to the majority of the squad still having the Moyes discipline, the following seasons we regressed badly even with a top quality striker.\nAgainst Peterborough last night Posh had a pacey left winger, Hayes. A type of player Moyes would look to buy rather than spend millions on a nobody from Europe, surely attracting players like this on sustainable wages is better tha loaning the likes of Harrison and paying him £90k a week.\nI suppose offically, I'm open minded.\n197 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:37:43\nCarsley and Baines have earned absolute zero stripes in senior club management. Carsley's total club experience is 10 lower level caretaker games 10 years ago, and he has said publicly that he has no interest in such a job. Bainesy just got his full professional licence a few months ago.\nWorking with kids does not remotely constitute the appropriate \"stripes\" for running a senior professional club in the toughest league on the planet. This is not a job for untried rookies.\nWe need an experienced professional winner.\n198 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:43:00\nAnd what are we winning now? If we stay where we are, or get relegated we're actually losing.\n199 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:48:10\n201 Posted 10/01/2025 at 18:51:42\nVery well said sir\n202 Posted 10/01/2025 at 19:02:21\n203 Posted 10/01/2025 at 19:10:11\nYou live and die by your decisions in football, just like you live and die by the decisions you make in life, and because they have spent all this money on purchasing Everton, it’s the Friedkin’s decision to make.\nI hope they are getting some very good advice and mine would be that if you want a football club to be successful then you have got to try and unite the whole club.\nWould appointing Moyes, unite Evertonians? Of course it wouldn’t, and especially if he’s bringing in Charlie Adam’s as his number two.\n204 Posted 10/01/2025 at 19:17:09\n205 Posted 10/01/2025 at 19:21:13\nI'm not a fan of Moyes over the cloud he left under, but he did do a superb job first time round, with no money to spend, Smith sold all our young players, but with Potter gone, and Fonseca not interested, I still would have approached Carsley, but in a relegation battle, who else is out there?\n206 Posted 10/01/2025 at 19:24:56\n207 Posted 10/01/2025 at 19:26:13\nIn my view, the football takes second place; the return of this defeatist, treacherous reptile, actually going to him cap on hand, is a low point in our history. Have we no pride left?\n208 Posted 10/01/2025 at 19:28:53\nI doubt very much though if theres anyone on the planet that can turn this squad as it stands into a challenging for a top 10 side.\n209 Posted 10/01/2025 at 19:30:51\nHow about a rebrand:\nMoyes Out Again Now\nYou're a steadfast remoaner no doubt?\n210 Posted 10/01/2025 at 19:33:13\n211 Posted 10/01/2025 at 19:36:26\nI’ve heard Rooney being part of the coaching staff with Bainsey. I could live with that.\n212 Posted 10/01/2025 at 19:38:42\nMoyes is yesterday's man.\nI actually loved what he done at our club, but he done it because he was young, fresh & different.\nWhich is what we need now, a young motivated, coach who can look at these players, who are not top top quality, but in my opinion are not as bad as our position. They just need some belief, confidence and enjoyment instilled in their play.\nI'd rather have Michael Carrick or Scott Parker, kieran mckenna than Moyes.\nWe were not in a too dissimilar position when Moyes took over, so why can't it be a coach on the way up not on the way down ?\n213 Posted 10/01/2025 at 19:47:26\n214 Posted 10/01/2025 at 19:49:45\n215 Posted 10/01/2025 at 19:51:38\nForget the glass ceiling stuff\nWe can even forget all the near misses in Cups and inability to beat the top teams\nWhat I struggle to forget is the shithouse way he left the Club\nWe were quick to jump on Benitez and his small team comment. However, in comparison that was nowhere near as bad as Moyes and his departure\n216 Posted 10/01/2025 at 19:55:14\n217 Posted 10/01/2025 at 20:02:57\nMoyes isn't just taking over a team with more points than the teams in the bottom four. They have all played a game more and our goal difference is superior to theirs.\nHe only has to replicate what Dyche has done and he will be considered a hero by his supporters.\nThose who have been screaming Dyche out and Moyes in better pray he can do it\n218 Posted 10/01/2025 at 20:08:21\n\"I feel like a mean motherfucker SIR\".\n\"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; / For he to-day that sheds his blood with me / Shall be my brother; be he ne’er so vile, / This day shall gentle his condition\".\n219 Posted 10/01/2025 at 20:15:25\n220 Posted 10/01/2025 at 20:33:36\nWe were dire for the entire 1990s, and were bang in trouble when we sacked Walter Smith and hired Moyes.\nIf his tenure was what amounted to failure, then barring Howard Kendall and Joe Royle, every manager we've had since 1972 has been a failure.\n221 Posted 10/01/2025 at 20:38:48\nDid he really say that because I suspect you are talking bollocks.\nIn fact, if you Google that quote with 'Moyes', the only hit is your post.\nHappy to be proved wrong if you can direct me to the source.\n222 Posted 10/01/2025 at 20:45:41\nMaybe Dave Lynch you can run through that presser on YouTube and give us the minute in which he erm \"said that\"?\nHere you go, Dave: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PfhkbI49ow\n223 Posted 10/01/2025 at 21:06:34\nYes, in his 1st season we finished 5th but it's worth remembering that in Moyes's last season, we finished 6th.\nDuring the following 2 seasons and a spend of over £60M and arguably the best striker in Europe at the time, we could only manage two 11th-place finishes.\nConsidering our aging defence, Martinez compounded it by bringing in Alcaraz and whilst being a pundit at the World Cup was offered Aderwiereld for €3.5M but opted for Besic due to his cameo against Argentina.\nI even can't forget that we could have had Van Dijk for £13M at the beginning of his final season but he thought Funes Mori was a better bet.\nFor me, £97M over 3 seasons poor recruitment and poor league placing did for Martinez.\n224 Posted 10/01/2025 at 21:10:31\n225 Posted 10/01/2025 at 21:16:01\nI mentioned Michael Carrick on another thread the other day- young,ambitious and likes to play football on the deck. Has a good record at Middlesbrough and his method's would be more suited to the PL. Managed 100 + games now in the Championship. Most of the British coaches struggle in the PL, however I think he may be the one that bucks that trend.\nWe will never know now by the looks of it. Looks like more of the same to me- as in an actual game,you got to be prepared to lose to win it, Everton just drift along safety first. Moyes did a good job 1st time round until he got into bed with Bill. At the start he was young and ambitious and we were in some hot water at the time too.\nHey ho and meh from me.\n226 Posted 10/01/2025 at 21:18:21\nI hate Moyes, he is a treacherous over rated big head.\nBut if I was confident he would keep us up I would welcome him back, I am not.\nAs I said earlier Moyes is my last choice but is the Friedkins first. So something is out of kilter.\n227 Posted 10/01/2025 at 21:23:32\nAllan, I too like Michael Carrick. Awell. we'll have to live with the better version of Dyche, leading us to BMD. Hopefully no more 🔪 to a gunfight.\n229 Posted 10/01/2025 at 21:27:52\nI would have Carrick over Moyes without hesitation. He is one of those managers were people will be saying in a couple of years time, why couldn't we have gone for someone like him?\nFriedkins – if you're listening – Carrick, not Moyes!\n230 Posted 10/01/2025 at 21:32:10\nBut time to unite who ever gets the job, and ensure Everton stay up.\nUTFTs!\n231 Posted 10/01/2025 at 23:07:13\nNot many players, managers or coaches are loved once they leave for pastures new but I've never had a problem with people leaving to better their careers.\nMany who haven't forgiven Moyes must still be living at home with their parents earning a few shillings cleaning chimneys or working down the local mines.\n232 Posted 11/01/2025 at 01:33:24\nI don’t live at home with my parents - long time dead\nI don’t clean chimneys or work down the mines\nI’ve been going to support my team since before Catterick so have a rough idea how Everton Football Club operate and how “some” supporters think\nMoyes was dead lucky getting the job after Smith, and compared to the crap who came after him gains credit\nHowever, this shithouse left us in a dirty underhanded way.\nHe could have done the decent thing and be honest and open\nHopefully if he comes back the guy with the scythe makes a reappearance next to the dugout\n233 Posted 11/01/2025 at 01:51:43\n234 Posted 11/01/2025 at 02:12:21\nI can neither forgive nor forget the manner he went Northeast on M62 in 2013: a de-facto \"Sayonara!

You certainly deserve it!\" (especially with the comical contract clause he agreed on that gave Man U tremendous ease in firing him)\nI understand where TFG came from, especially with the tremendous job Ranieri did in stabilising Roma on & off the pitch this season. The return of Moyes, however, really left a bad taste on my mouth.\n235 Posted 11/01/2025 at 02:29:16\n236 Posted 11/01/2025 at 02:41:52\nBut his managerial history suggests pretty strongly that he stands more of a chance than Sean Dyche.\nSince staying in the league until we can move stadium is an all-consuming desire for the fan-base, this is not at all a terrible appointment.\nAfter some stability, we can go for the mythical, continental, dynamic, innovative, entertaining young managerial prodigy that must exist out there beyond our fan's fevered imaginations.\n237 Posted 11/01/2025 at 03:13:33\nHe's regularly seen in one or two of Lytham's excellent pubs having a drink or two with other retired Scottish centre-backs of glory, such as Colin Hendry, the centre-back equivalent of Gazza.\nHe's very, very comfortable in his early sixties, loaded beyond the dreams of us ordinary folk, in no way interested in managing a.n.other struggling club according to what he publicly said THIS year, so why, just why, are our new owners unable after months of buy-out preparation now reportedly contemplating re-appointing a Kenwright ass-licker par eminence, who thereby secured the start of a mega-fortune for himself, allied with a CV of next to fuck-all achievement as a manager here and there in the process?\nAnd then there's his blatant derision of us re Baines and Fellaini.\nNo thanks Davey, just continue with your remarkably opulent, significantly unearned retirement if it's all the same to you.\nWe're in a relegation dog-fight, if you'd just look beyond your bank balance! And that on your own admission is the last thing you want at this stage of your largely mundane career and I agree with you on that!\n238 Posted 11/01/2025 at 03:44:31\n239 Posted 11/01/2025 at 04:29:03\n\"You seem like a nice fella Don.

Would we see a big improvement?\nProbably not in the short term so whoever comes in is fighting an uphill battle. Not my preferred choice for Moyes to come in but who else would even want to take this on? The Italian maestro didn't hang around for long and was a so called Hollywood manager who left us well off the pace when he jumped ship.\nWe need to be patient and hope he gives us a better standard of football than what we have witnessed this season and the two seasons previously.\nMoyes this time he has no knife for his gunfight. Best he will have is probably a flashlight with run down batteries so we need to get behind him and see what he brings.\nDyche kept us up for two seasons and leaves with little credibility but I wish him well for what he left us with. It might have been two seasons in the Championship with a very poor squad that might not have been good enough to get us out. The new owners would likely never have come near us had we not been in the PL so for me he deserves what he receives as he departs.\nDown we may go but a change was required to try with a different set of ideas. The shelves were bare for a top quality appointment so we again are shopping in Aldi,\nLet's pray we gat a bargain and try to build a firmer future.\n244 Posted 11/01/2025 at 08:11:35\n245 Posted 11/01/2025 at 09:42:43\nThe new manager has a huge task ahead of him!\n246 Posted 11/01/2025 at 09:50:51\n247 Posted 11/01/2025 at 10:50:45\n248 Posted 11/01/2025 at 12:44:52\nEvery one of Everton's players and managers and supporters and staff have made mistakes, said stupid things and did things to hurt others... that's called being human. But hopefully we get over those things, learn and move on.\nOtherwise we can never be happy – and will always criticise and blame others for our own unhappiness. Not a partner, not a workplace, nor a football team is there to make us happy – they need to be bonuses. So get a life outside of football so that you might once in a while enjoy watching a game, regardless of manager and team.\nNo wonder the atmosphere in Goodison is often described as toxic... should be intimidating for the opposition, yes, but toxic towards our own??\nIf 'being a fan(atic)' means abusing others in the stadium, online or otherwise, then I don't want to be a fan... rather just support the team I chose among 3 reds at a time when everyone else followed the dark side or Man Utd.\nYes, Moyes is not a dream choice – but I don't know how often I've dreamt back to the days of Cahill, Jagielka, Lescott, Osman, young Seamus, Arteta, Yakubu etc...\nBack then, there was a big gap to the top – but they played some decent football and every now and again gave us hope and goals and fight and pride.\nSo, let's see what Moyes does this time round. I for one will support (and criticise) the team and hope for better days ahead, through thick and thin – that's what loyalty is IMHO.\n249 Posted 11/01/2025 at 18:26:47\nGood post Kevin @ 248.\n250 Posted 11/01/2025 at 20:03:48\n251 Posted 12/01/2025 at 23:03:54\n252 Posted 12/01/2025 at 23:42:21\nI've been saddened by the reaction to his return. I am quite stunned by the amount of toxic feeling there has been.\nHowever, I remember the later days of his first reign, being on the live forum and it doesn't surprise me I suppose.\nEveryone is entitled to their opinion, fine. Yet what has been frustrating is all the re-writing of history. In the past three days I've read that he was culpable in holding back the progression of Seamus Coleman (total nonsense), that he never won Derbies and was generally the Devil incarnate.\nHe'll get more of a tune out of the attack. He doesn't necessarily have the players he had the first time but he's better than Dyche and his record backs that up.\nWhat has most stunned me is people slagging him off like we were consistently better prior or subsequent to 2002-2013??\n253 Posted 12/01/2025 at 23:54:35\nMartinez definitely benefited from his defensive set up.\n254 Posted 13/01/2025 at 00:23:11\nAs for his appointment, it's not what we want our club to be about. But it's what our club currently is about. It's clearly not the result of long term planning. It's not an appointment that is aligned to a particular strategy for the club. But if anyone expected that then they were deluded in the face of some obvious facts. The leadership is still being decided and we don't even really have a decision on who will be the club's DoF. We're at least 6 months away from being able to make those kind of well considered managerial appointments.\nSo judge it for what it is, rather than what it isn't. We need an experienced manager who can guide us to Bramley Moore and put down some foundations for a rebuild.\nI can't think of many more qualified, available candidates.\nHe's relatively normal too, which is a nice change of pace from the weirdo we just got rid of.\n255 Posted 13/01/2025 at 00:25:38\nExactly right mate\n256 Posted 13/01/2025 at 01:16:02\nBut what concerns me more is the fact that our new owners think this is a good move, that he's the man to turn the ship away from the rocks. I can understand Dyche had to go but to rush straight into Davie's open arms says to me that these guys have as much football acumen as Farhad Moshiri. Many Evertonians do not consider him a legend in fact he's only a short step away from Rafa the Red in my opinion. No wonder Roma fans are disgruntled.\nJust a couple of days ago I had hopes that our future was a little brighter but now I'm afraid we will continue to sink even further with TFG in charge and our heads are barely above water as it is.\n257 Posted 13/01/2025 at 01:33:42\nThis guy? https://youtu.be/lX3kpKdasPA?si=xTrrsd81V187wF7w\n(Interview filmed a few months back - well worth a listen)\n258 Posted 13/01/2025 at 19:29:34\nI would never dispute that. The defence and decent goalies was what Moyes always delivered. The departure of Lescott was a big blow because an eventual back four of Baines, Jags, Lescott, Seamus...that would have been excellent and added a lot of the attack.\nBut the Roberto began deprogramming the defence and we...ahem...never looked back.\n259 Posted 14/01/2025 at 07:34:38\nOur managerial options are more limited, our finances worse, our morale even worse.\nTrue Everton success isn't what Moyes gave us previously and rightly fans were frustrated back then as we failed to make the next step forward but over the next 2.5 years we are rebuilding the club and if Moyes gets us to finish 8-12th then that is the building blocks from which we can then move forward with.\nWe have to be pragmatic and accept that turning Everton round will take time and this is phase one, stabilisation, which Moyes should be good at.\n260 Posted 14/01/2025 at 14:26:11\nTwo ripostes from me:\n1. We were awful before his tenure.\n2. We were (bar the following season) awful to suicidally bad after it.\nPersonally, I just want to have some pride back in my football club. He gave me that last time. He should be given the chance to do the same again.\nAnd if he can arse us a trophy like he did at West Ham, I might just never be sober again…\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
