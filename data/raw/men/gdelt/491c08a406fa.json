Los Blancos then turned it round with two goals in the space of nine minutes from defenders Antonio Rudiger and Ferland Mendy.\nAntoine Griezmann brought it back to 2-2 before half-time, becoming Atletico's all-time leading goalscorer in the process with his 174th strike for the club to surpass Luis Aragones on 173.\nAtletico then thought they had done enough to reach the Supercopa final for the first time since 2020 when Rudiger found the net again, but this time at the wrong end.\nDani Carvajal, who had earlier missed a glorious chance to put Real into the lead, then popped up with the dramatic 85th minute equaliser that forced the tie into extra-time. It wasn’t quite as dramatic as the 2014 Champions League final between the two, but certainly reminiscent.\nExtra-time was a tense affair that wasn't decided until near the end when the contest looked to be heading for a penalty shootout. Instead, another own goal – this time from Atletico’s Stefan Savic – handed Real the lead.\nWith Diego Simeone's team increasingly desperate and Jan Oblak heading up to put an extra body in the box, a Real counter finished by Brahim Diaz into an empty deep into stoppage time of the additional period finally settled it in Real's favour.",
