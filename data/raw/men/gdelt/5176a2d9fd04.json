Thinking, ‘Right, what’s happening with the team?’ ‘What’s going to happen with the manager because we knew he [Sir Alex Ferguson] didn’t have that long left.\n“The club offered me a new five-year deal but then we just sold [Carlos] Tevez, we just sold [Cristiano] Ronaldo and I said to the manager, ‘It’s no disrespect to Phil Jones or Chris Smalling – they are obviously not going to replace Ronaldo and Tevez and I just wanted assurances that it wasn’t going to be another transition.\n“I didn’t have the time personally, so I felt it was important to ask the question. Is it going to be a three, four-year transition, or is it going to be we’re going to win trophies now and he told me to get out of his office – so then I got more sense out of David Gill of what the plan was.”\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nRooney would ultimately make a u-turn on his decision, with Manchester United winning the 2010-11 Premier League title and again finishing top of the pile in 2012-13, which proved to be Ferguson’s final season with the club.\nWayne Rooney was speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet\nMore Manchester United stories\n“I thought he’d come round eventually” – Martin Edwards on the day Sir Alex Ferguson RESIGNED as Manchester United boss, months before the Treble\nManchester United star sets Premier League record - beating Erling Haaland and Thierry Henry\n“I’d love half an hour in that dressing room” – what Sir Alex Ferguson says about the modern Manchester United team, according to his long-time friend\nFor more than a decade, Joe Mewis has worked in football journalism as a reporter and editor.
