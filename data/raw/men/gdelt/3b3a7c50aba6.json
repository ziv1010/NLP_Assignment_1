Alanyaspor had four, plus two each from Besiktas, Konyaspor, Kayserispor, Caykur Rizespor, Gaziantep, Goztepe, Kasimpasa, Trabzonspor and Fatih Karagumruk, and one apiece at Antalyaspor, Eyupspor and Samsunspor.\nThe remaining 997 were made up of players from the lower divisions of Turkish football, including the 1. Lig, 2. Lig and 3. Lig — its second, third and fourth tiers.\nThe TFF also announced that while the Super Lig and 1. Lig will continue as usual, fixtures in the two divisions below have been postponed for two weeks.\nAre high-profile players involved?\nYes. Perhaps the best known is 25-year-old Eren Elmali, a defender for Galatasaray who has featured in all four of the Istanbul club’s Champions League games this season, including the 1-0 win against Liverpool in September. He has played 20 times for Turkey’s national team and was in their squad for the World Cup qualifying matches over the coming week against Bulgaria and Spain, but got stood down when the allegations came to light.\n“I want to make it clear that the reason my name appears in this file is because, about five years ago, a bet was placed on a match involving my former team, without my knowledge or involvement,” Elmali wrote in an Instagram story post. “Since that day, I have had no connection whatsoever to betting or this issue.”\nAdvertisement\nAnother player implicated was Celil Yuksel, a 27-year-old midfielder who started out in the youth ranks at Galatasaray but now plays for Samsunspor.\nHe wrote on Instagram: “I have full faith that Turkish justice will prevail. The accusations made against me are unlawful, and I deeply regret that my career has been affected in this way. I would like to state that I will pursue my right of defence through all legal means available.”\nThe Besiktas players named are 24-year-old backup goalkeeper Ersin Destanoglu and long-serving midfielder Necip Uysal, 34, who has been capped once by Turkey.\nOn X, Destanoglu wrote how the allegations made against him were “completely baseless, unfounded and untrue.” He added: “I will not allow myself to be judged in the public eye based on these defamatory and baseless accusations; I will exercise all legal rights granted to me by law to the fullest extent.”\nMeanwhile, Uysal said in a statement, that was reported by Turkish media: “In my entire life, I’ve never even gone near betting, I’ve never downloaded a betting app on my phone, I don’t have any membership or account anywhere. An account was opened on a betting site using my Turkish ID number, without my knowledge. Through that account, two bets were placed using a bonus coupon — but I did not open that account, and I did not play those bets.”\nWhat are the clubs saying?\nIn addition to the players’ responses, a handful of Super Lig teams have issued statements.\n“We have full faith in the innocence of both of our footballers,” Besiktas said. “Initiatives will be promptly undertaken on our part with the TFF. The footballers in question will also apply to the Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office tomorrow morning to lodge their legal objections.”\nIn their statement, Galatasaray said: “This sensitive process is being meticulously followed by our club. Our wish is that this entire process concludes in the most accurate and equitable manner, without harming the personal rights of our footballers and the brand value of Turkish football.\nAdvertisement\n“As we emphasised in our previous statements, our struggle on this issue is an uncompromising matter in terms of the reliability and reputation of football. Our club is closely monitoring the details of the incident and awaits the completion of the process for justice to be served in the most accurate way.”\nElsewhere, Samsunspor said they were a club “that acts in accordance with the principles of justice, integrity, and fair play”, while in their statements Konyaspor and Fatih Karagumruk said they hoped the principles of justice would be upheld during the investigation process.\nIs anyone else implicated in this investigation?\nVery much so. These revelations around players follow the news on October 27 that hundreds of match officials in Turkey had been accused of betting on the sport over a five-year period, dating back to 2020.\nTFF president Ibrahim Haciosmanoglu detailed at a press conference that 371 of the current active 571 match officials in Turkish football had betting accounts. Of those 371, it was revealed that 152 actively gamble, with Haciosmanoglu telling reporters one official had wagered 18,277 times and a further 10 referees had placed more than 10,000 bets each. He added that seven referees and 15 assistant referees who were actively making bets officiated in Turkey’s top two divisions.\n“To get Turkish football back to where it belongs, we need to clean up whatever filth there is,” he announced at the press conference.\nFour days later, on October 31, it was announced that 149 match officials had been suspended. The bans range between eight and 12 months, while investigations continue into three referees.\nIn recent years, refereeing has become an increasingly hot topic in Turkey, with frequent accusations of bias made against match officials. Most notoriously, in December 2023, referee Halil Umut Meler was punched in the face by Ankaragucu’s club president Faruk Koca at the end of a game. That incident led to the suspension of all Super Lig football.\nAdvertisement\nAre there any other investigations ongoing?\nYes. The Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office has been looking into allegations of potential match-fixing since April this year. Another investigation carried out by the Antalya Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office was combined with the Istanbul one.\nOn November 7, it was reported by Reuters — citing the country’s state-owned Anadolu news agency — that Turkish authorities had issued detention orders for 21 people, including 17 referees and a club chairman. Four days later, Reuters — again citing local media reports — reported eight people, including the chairman of a prominent Turkish club, had been arrested.\nThe Athletic has contacted the team in question for comment but had received no response at the time of publication.\nWhat are the rules around players betting on football?\nAs The Athletic previously explained, world football governing body FIFA’s code of ethics, which applies to officials, players and nearly all participants in the game, outlines that they are “forbidden from participating in, either directly or indirectly, betting, gambling, lotteries or similar events or transactions related to football matches or competitions and/or any related football activities.”\nUnder Article 27, those who break the code risk a minimum penalty of 100,000 Swiss francs (£95,000; $125,000) and a ban from football lasting up to three years.\nMeanwhile, Article 57 of the Football Disciplinary Directive, referenced by the TFF in their press release, prohibits players, officials and others involved in football from betting on matches. Offenders face suspensions ranging from three months to a year if found guilty.\nUEFA, European football’s governing body, told The Athletic it was in contact with the TFF on the matter but had no further comment at this stage.\nAdvertisement\nHas anything similar happened in another country’s football league?\nBetting scandals in football are reasonably common, but this one is rare in its scale.\nIn 2009, an investigation led by the Prosecutorial Office in the German city of Bochum uncovered a wide-ranging plot to influence the outcome of matches throughout Europe. Around 200 fixtures were investigated across nine countries, with players, coaches and officials all found to have accepted bribes. Last year, the Chinese Football Association banned 38 players and five club officials for life after a probe into match-fixing and gambling that spanned two years, Reuters reported at the time.\nThe Turkish betting scandal would represent the biggest one of recent times, however, which helps explain Haciosmanoglu’s bleak assessment of the crisis to CNN in an interview on October 31.\n“There is a moral problem in Turkish football,” he said. “There is no such thing as structure. The fundamental problem at the core of Turkish football is an ethical one.\n“The emergence of this is like draining the swamp. Let’s drain the swamp and move forward.”\nHow could the winter transfer window be affected?\nGiven the chaos caused by suspending so many players at once, there has been a knock-on effect on the Turkish winter transfer window.\nInitially, this was due to open on January 5 and close on February 10. But with so many clubs potentially being without players due to the betting investigation, the TFF has asked FIFA, which approves the dates of leagues’ transfer windows, to give it an additional 15-day period beyond the scheduled window for Turkish clubs to plug gaps in their squads.\nAny extension would then have a potential knock-on for other leagues, who may find their own players targeted by teams in Turkey beyond the end date of their own transfer windows. Those in England, Spain, Italy and France, for example, will all end on February 2.\nThe Athletic has asked FIFA for comment.\nAdditional reporting: Asli Pelit",
