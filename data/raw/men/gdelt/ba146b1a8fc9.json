I’m telling you now, he will sack him,” O’Hara told talkSPORT.\n“If he thinks he can go this all the way through the season and keep defending like this, keep having set pieces like this, he will get sacked.\n“Daniel Levy is all about Champions League football, Europa League minimum. If Spurs are tenth in the table after Christmas, they’ll sack Ange.\n“I’m telling you, they’ll sack him. This can’t continue.\n“I know everyone loves Ange, you know, in terms of like the attacking football. I can’t, I’m getting bored of watching this.”\nThings don’t get any easier for Postecoglou and Tottenham as they prepare to face an in-form Chelsea side in north London on Sunday still missing several first-team stars.\nIn fairness to the Australian, he has been incredibly unlucky with key players suffering from injuries, with key centre-back duo Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven the obvious standouts, along with keeper Guglielmo Vicario.\nHowever, his stubbornness to continue trying to play out from the back with inferior players has led to multiple mistakes that could have cost Tottenham far more than the 15 goals they have conceded in the league this season.\nLatest Tottenham news: Spurs learn centre-back target asking price / Inter midfielder wanted\nTottenham have been told how much it will cost to sign rising Lens star Abdukodir Khusanov amid competition for his services from Newcastle United, Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille, it has been claimed.\nTottenham need defensive reinforcements as they usually struggle when starting centre-backs Van de Ven and Romero are out injured, as showcased in Thursday’s 1-0 defeat at Bournemouth. Radu Dragusin and Ben Davies are Ange Postecoglou’s backup options, though the latter is now 31 years old and may soon need to be replaced.\nKhusanov is the latest centre-half to emerge on Tottenham’s radar. According to new reports, Tottenham are ‘monitoring’ the 20-year-old’s exciting development and have scouted him on several occasions this year, with his asking price now emerging.\nMeanwhile, Spurs are ready to bid €35m for a goalscoring midfielder and Inter Milan’s surprise stance on a January sale has been revealed by a report.\nTottenham have found Serie A fertile ground for signing new players in recent years. Indeed, Guglielmo Vicario, Radu Dragusin, Cristian Romero, Destiny Udogie, Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski were all bought from Italian clubs.\nAnd according to a fresh update from SpazioInter.it, Spurs have once again fixed their gaze on Serie A.\nIt’s claimed the north London outfit are ‘ready to offer 35 million euros’ for an Inter star.",
