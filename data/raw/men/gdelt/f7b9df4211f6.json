He found it hard at Tottenham and I feel like he was pushed away by Antonio Conte because he wasn’t his type of player, but I tell you what, if he was there now with Ange Postecoglou, he’d be playing!\n“He’s an Ange type of player – he keeps the ball, he wants to pass forward and he’s got energy in midfield. I actually think he’s a better player than Oliver Skipp, so I would have kept Winks at Tottenham.\n“He’s been a brilliant signing for Leicester and he’s shown his quality. He’s probably gone in there and thought, ‘this is a Premier League club, I’ve probably got to suffer for a season in the Championship, but this is my route to starting regularly in the Premier League'”.\nWinks better than Skipp and Hojbjerg\nThere is certainly a strong argument for suggesting that Winks is much more suited to Postecoglou’s style of play than both Skipp and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, who were both better playing in the more conservative approach of both Conte and Jose Mourinho.\nWinks actually signed a new five-year deal with the club after starting the Champions League final against Liverpool back in 2019, but things went downhill for him after Mauricio Pochettino’s exit just a few months later.\nHe eventually ended up joining Italian side Sampdoria on loan for the 2022/23 campaign before his permanent switch to Leicester last summer.\nTottenham’s current first-choice midfield paring of Yves Bissouma and Pape Sarr both struggled with the energy and dynamism of the Wolves midfield last weekend, which was a far cry from their form through the first 10 games of the campaign.\nHowever, they looked to still be suffering the after-effects of playing at the African Cup of Nations throughout January and February and should be better for having a weekend off after Spurs were due to play Carabao Cup finalists Chelsea.\nA home clash with London rivals Crystal Palace is up next for Tottenham, who have now dropped five points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa in the race for Champions League football – although they do have a game in hand.",
