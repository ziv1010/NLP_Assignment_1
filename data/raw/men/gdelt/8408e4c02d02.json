Enter, Oscar Fryer. In the process of returning after 12 months sidelined with an ACL injury, the 19-year-old substitute produced a memorable moment. A stunning left-foot strike curling into the side netting for a 2-1 advantage.\nSend offs in quick succession, Grozos followed by Heidelberg's Johnny Apostolopoulos, did nothing to deter Newcastle's Ben Gibson from sealing the deal five minutes from full-time.\nCelebrations were now in full swing. The crowd figure was 10,000.\nTHE GAMEBREAKER\nWith an Australia Cup final hanging in the balance at 1-all, Jets coach Mark Milligan called on his bench.\nOne by one, experienced starters came from the field - Burgess, Lachlan Rose, Kota Mizunuma, Daniel Wilmering.\nEntering the fray throughout the second half, all aged 22 or under, were the likes of Gibson, Lachlan Bayliss, Christian Bracco, Alexandro Nunes and, eventual man of the moment, Fryer.\nSix minutes into extra-time and Fryer seized his opportunity.\nCaught in \"no-man's land\" near the byline, Fryer cut back inside the penalty box and accelerated away from his Heidelberg defender.\nWith room to move and an eye for goal, the teenager put 12 months worth of sidelined energy into one special left-foot hit and Newcastle, for the first time, found themselves ahead (2-1).\n\"Sort of speechless after that one,\" Fryer told host broadcaster Paramount Plus after full-time.\n\"I was out for 12 months [ACL] so to come back and win a final, it's a dream come true.\n\"It's been 12 months of anticipation building up and I let it all out with that left foot, so amazing.\"\nFryer, a Sydney FC academy product, only made his debut for the Jets recently, a round-of-16 derby with local NPL club Cooks Hill at No.2 Sportsground.\nHe explained the thought process around that pivotal play.\n\"I was in no man's land, but once I got him [defender] square I could go either way. Beat him, it happened, created the space and knocked it home,\" Fryer said.\nHe also paid tribute to manager Milligan, who has his post-match press conference stormed by celebrating Jets players.\n\"Millsy's brought a great brand of football to the boys, instilled a hard-work attitude in all the boys that represents the Newcastle community well,\" Fryer said.\nTHE HOMEGROWN TALENT\nWill Dobson summed it all up pretty simply amid the celebrations.\n\"Honestly, I've never felt like this,\" he told host broadcaster Paramount Plus on Saturday night.\nDobson, 18 and born around six months before the Jets last claimed silverware, has climbed up the club ranks since his junior days at Belmont.\nHe paid tribute to Newcastle's travelling fan base at Lakeside Stadium and also gave a nod to players who paved the way previously wearing red and blue.\n\"To run over there to those fans, they followed us, two buses came from Newcastle this morning, they left at 430 [am] just to travel here and to see that,\" Dobson said.\n\"I was in the stands for 2018, the heartbreak in that final [A-League loss], and to give these guys that feeling is just.\"\nIn relation to assessing Dobson's own performance - earning a spot in the starting XI, dangerous touches across the park, helping set up one goal and almost scoring another himself.\n\"The gaffa [Milligan] has put a lot of confidence in me,\" he said.\n\"I started out here tonight and I think I did kind of ok. It's all I want to do - bring energy, play my game and show how good I am.\"\nMARK VIDUKA MEDAL\nMAX Burgess, 30, was frozen out of Sydney FC last season.\nHe arrived at the Newcastle Jets for 2025-2026, having enjoyed a brief stint previously around a decade ago.\nNow, he's not only an Australian Cup champion, but also the recipient of the Mark Viduka Medal for being voted best on ground in the knockout final.\n\"It's really special. I'm sort of lost for words at the moment. The boys and club have really taken me in and I'm really grateful to be part of it. So stoked,\" Burgess told host broadcaster Paramount Plus.\nBurgess netted the all-important equaliser in the 21st minute, a well-timed run inside the box and putting away an assist from Aquilina down the right.\nHe was replaced midway through the second half, and gave a nod to the younger brigade of high-flying Jets.\n\"Not just today but this whole cup run, they've won us games and been brave in big moments,\" Burgess said.\n\"Especially today, me and Kota [Mizunuma] came off, I was cramping and had nothing left.\n\"They came on and were brave, positive, as they have been the entire run, so stoked for them.\"\nBurgess feels like leadership and lifestyle have helped him find his feet in Newcastle this campaign.\n\"I've really focused on processes for me and trying to lead in this group, which I think has brought something out in me,\" he said.\n\"Also just trying to work hard and be the best version of myself and just focus on that.\n\"Life outside football in Newy is amazing - the surf, cafes and people are so friendly. So loving being there.\"\nThe starting XI was: James Delianov, Aquilina, Aleksandar Susnjar, Mark Natta, Wilmering, Grozos, Dobson, Burgess, Mizunuma, Rose and Xavier Bortoncello.\nBayliss, Gibson, Nunes, Fryer, Bracco and Lucas Dean Scicluna were the substitutes used.\nEli Adams and Joe Shaughnessy were missing through injury, Max Cooper dropped out late due to illness and Alex Badolato continues at the Under-20 World Cup in Chile.\nCelebrations are tipped to continue in Newcastle on Monday, with Jets players appearing with the Australia Cup at Queens Wharf Brewery from 11am to 1pm.\nA-League opening round in a fortnight sees an away derby with the Central Coast Mariners (Sunday, October 19).\nA-LEAGUE FINALS HOPE AND SHOT AT ASIA\nAAP reports: Fresh off a maiden Australia Cup title, Newcastle coach Mark Milligan wants the long-floundering Jets to embrace the expectation of finals, then a shot at Asian football.\nThe Jets sealed their first trophy in 17 years with a 3-1 victory over Heidelberg United in Saturday night's final at Lakeside Stadium.\nThey have only played finals once in the past 15 years but former Socceroos captain Milligan believes Newcastle can return to the top six.\n\"We want to be a team that plays finals football. We want to compete for things. We're trying to build a brand of football that we think will do that,\" Milligan said.\n\"We're trying to create a squad in terms of the competitive nature that will do that. We want to be fighting for things. I want our fans to be excited by this.\n\"Expectation's not a bad thing. I want these players to be driven. I don't want them to feel like just because we've won the Cup we've succeeded, because we're a long way away from succeeding.\n\"There's still a lot of growth in this group to go. There's a lot of hard work to do, but I'm not going to cap what success looks like for them.\"\nNewcastle have also qualified for next year's Asian Champions League 2 competition.\nMilligan, who won the 2015 Asian Cup and had stints in China, Japan, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, says Australian football needs to embrace that stage.\n\"We should all strive to do well, to be a part of and to do well in Asia,\" he said.\n\"Especially with my history as well. I played a lot of football through Asia. I have a great appreciation for a lot of countries over there and how they go about their business.\n\"It's a tough competition, but now I believe it's more rewarding for clubs to want to do well in it.\n\"As a nation, as a footballing nation, we should want to be a part of it and we should want to do well in it.\"\nHeidelberg, who won $25,000 as runners-up, will prepare for their Australian Championship campaign, which kicks off next week.\nBut coach John Anastasiadis wouldn't be surprised if some of his players receive late calls from A-League clubs.\n\"They haven't done themselves any disservice,\" he said.\n\"You can get a knock on the door, and I told them football changes every day.\n\"It can change in a moment, so I'm hoping some of them do get a chance.\"\nAnastasiadis is rated as one of the best coaches outside the A-League Men but was modest on his chances of a move to a higher league.\n\"It's great to have this success, no doubt it helps,\" he said.\n\"But you just wait and see. If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't ... well, we keep going.\"",
