He went on to make 108 appearances for Tottenham across his half-decade at the club.\nLo Celso also contributed 11 goals during his time in north London, with his final strike coming in a thrilling 3-3 draw away at Manchester City in December 2023.\nThe midfielder was never a regular under any of his managers at Spurs - Mauricio Pochettino, Jose Mourinho, Ryan Mason, Antonio Conte and Ange Postecoglou - and departs on a permanent basis.\nLo Celso heads back to Spain having established himself as a Betis favourite during a successful 2018/19 campaign. He also returned to La Liga between 2022 and 2023 on loan at Villarreal.\nReports claim as part of Spurs' agreement with Betis, they have a 'priority option' to sign promising midfielder Johnny Cardoso. If Tottenham don't take up this option, they will retain a sell-on clause for the USA international.",
