  "body_text": "Good morning. At 10am yesterday, the cardinals of the Catholic church gathered for mass in St Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City. In the afternoon, the 133 who are eligible electors went to the Sistine Chapel, handed over their smartphones and swore an oath of secrecy, perhaps knowing that signal jammers will block any communication with the outside world in any case. A few hours later, they took the first vote on choosing the successor to Pope Francis. We know because at 9pm, two hours later than expected, the black smoke went up – which also means their deliberations continue.\nA process famous for its arcane trappings is also a thoroughly modern electoral battle. But that description, and the hilarious fact that the movie Conclave has helped shape our cultural understanding of what happens next, omits the fact that it is also a matter of the utmost spiritual seriousness to those taking part, who hope that the Holy Spirit will guide them collectively to make the best choice for the church and its more than a billion members.\nFor today’s newsletter, I spoke again to Anna Rowlands, a political theologian and professor of Catholic social thought at Durham University, about how the spiritual and worldly imperatives will interact – and what the combination means for the church’s future. Here are the headlines.\nFive big stories\n-\nTrade | Donald Trump is expected to announce the framework of a trade agreement with the UK after teasing a major announcement with a “big and highly respected country.” An agreement would mark the first deal for the White House since Trump imposed sweeping global tariffs last month.\n-\nSecurity | Israel’s embassy in London was the target of an alleged terror plot involving a group of Iranian nationals, sources have told the Guardian. Police and the Security Service, MI5, believe the plot was at an advanced but not imminent stage when arrests were made on Saturday.\n-\nKashmir | Pakistan has warned that it will “avenge” the death of 31 people killed in overnight missile attacks by the Indian air force, raising fears of an escalating conflict between the two nuclear-armed countries.\n-\nUK politics | Labour MPs have ramped up pressure on the Treasury, calling for an economic reset after the Reform UK surge in the local elections and saying that the economy is stuck in a “doom loop”. The warning comes from the influential Labour Growth Group (LGG), a large caucus of loyalist new MPs.\n-\nMusic | The late One Direction star Liam Payne left behind a £24.3m fortune after dying without a will. Cheryl Tweedy, his former partner and mother of his son, Bear, is legally responsible for Payne’s money, property and possessions after being named an administrator for his estate.\nIn depth: Gossiping cardinals, tactical voting – and a search for the Holy Spirit\nFor a process famed for its secrecy, there’s an incredible amount of information flying around about the papal conclave. In 2005, the Italian magazine Limes published a diary by an anonymous cardinal describing the election of Benedict XVI (then Joseph Ratzinger), which noted a Portuguese elector’s enthusiasm for after-dinner cigars; Robert Harris, the author of the novel on which Conclave is based, had the help of the recollections of the late archbishop of Westminster, Cormac Murphy-O’Connor, who liked the book so much he wanted to give a copy to Pope Francis. (History sadly doesn’t record if he got it, or had any thoughts on the ending.)\nAs Harriet Sherwood reports here, the conclave draws Aperol-glugging tourists and nuns with smartphones to stare at the chimney from St Peter’s Square. But at its heart, the conclave remains a genuinely secluded affair. “For all that we know about previous conclaves, there’s a decorum and dignity to the process that befits its sacredness,” Anna Rowlands said. Still, there’s a lot of intrigue as well.\nWhy are the cardinals so media-friendly?\nOne of the most striking aspects of the buildup to the conclave was the number of chatty cardinals making appearances in news stories.\nThis New York Times piece, for example, quotes four of them by name, including some thoroughly catty observations about the influx of new blood from the German conservative Gerhard Müller. This piece by Angela Giuffrida paints an entertaining portrait of red-capped clerics fleeing from hordes of journalists, and others making calculated anonymous interventions to spread rumours about the candidates they dislike.\nOf course, that was all before the conclave got underway; at the general congregation that precedes it, the imperatives are different. “We’re had more of a glimpse into the internal conversation than we might have expected,” Rowlands said.\nWhile that may have partly been driven by a wish to shape the broader discourse around the papacy, the ultimate audience for those comments was the conclave itself. “What’s in the public domain is still an intervention in their own conversation,” Rowlands said. “It’s a sign of the lack of settledness on one or two candidates above any others.”\nWhat are the biggest issues in the decision?\nThe selection of the next pope is obviously always vastly consequential, but it may be an even bigger deal than usual this time: the church is deeply divided over the future of Francis’s focus on “synodality”, which can be roughly defined as a drive for more lay people to be involved in decision-making.\n“A lot of time has been spent during the general congregation on church governance, and what should happen to Francis’s synodal reforms,” Rowlands said: “Whether they should be actively pursued, resisted, or the middle camp that thinks there should be some degree of synodality, but that it should be moderated.”\nSome want the papacy to return to Italy after a 47-year gap; previously, it was held by an Italian for 450 years straight. Against that tradition is the argument the church must look to its growing numbers in Asia and Africa to provide its leader for the first time.\nAs well-worn debates over issues like divorce, married priests, and the church’s stance on same-sex relationships attest, there is also the question over what kind of moral leadership the church should provide.\n“They spent a huge amount of time in the general congregation talking about how you evangelise the world and mediate peace in an increasingly polarised society,” Rowlands said. More conservative thinkers argue the church needs to take a clear doctrinal line “and repeat it in a culture that is very lost”, she said; more progressive voices agree with Francis that “the way to reach people is to walk together with people through the complexities of their lives”.\nWhat does the composition of the conclave tell us?\nThe sheer number of new cardinals appointed by Francis – who make up 80% of the conclave – has made the contest very difficult to predict. Many are from countries that have never provided a cardinal before; and there are a lot more from Asia and Africa, at the expense of Europe. “There is a huge diversity of perspective,” Rowlands said. “We don’t get a direct insight into exactly how that complex geographic mix plays out.”\nIn this piece, former Vatican communications official Ariel Beramendi points to progressive and conservative factions, as well as a more moderate current of opinion. But it is hard to know how the priorities of members of each group will change once the process gets under way, Rowlands said.\n“There will be no more digesting what’s happening with their staff or other people they might have been speaking to. And there is a concentrated pressure on the process from wanting to reach a good decision in two or three days. Seeing the minds of the other cardinals through the early voting is crucial: they may think they’re behind one person and by the next vote be seeing it very differently.”\nAre there any clear frontrunners?\nNotwithstanding the aphorism that “he who enters the conclave as pope, leaves as a cardinal”, there are certainly a few names that have emerged from the general congregation as having significant support – among them Francis’s secretary of state, Pietro Parolin; Luis Antonio Tagle, a progressive from the Philippines; and Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Italian patriarch of Jerusalem. They, and a number of others, are detailed in this piece by Harriet Sherwood and Sam Jones.\nThere is also a sense that there is an appetite for an older pope. As one bishop told Beramendi: “We need a new holy father, not an eternal father.” That might count against Pizzaballa, who is 60. “We know that there is a group who would like Parolin to be pope,” Rowlands said. “But in general it is a very fluid and changeable picture.”\nIt’s a mug’s game trying to predict, even if the bookies are expecting a rush of bets. And, Rowlands said, whoever gets the job may not be predictable. “The office makes the man as much as the man makes the office. Everyone will reach for Google when the name is announced, but that doesn’t necessarily tell you what kind of pope they will be.”\nShe points to the example of John XXIII, who came in looking like a caretaker pope with little charisma and ended up calling the second Vatican council, which produced the most significant set of reforms to church doctrine and practice in the 20th century.\n“Francis was arguably transformed by becoming pope too,” she added. “He wasn’t always seen as a charismatic or forceful figure as bishop of Buenos Aires, but he ended up with the conviction and urgency of a man in a hurry.”\nAre there limits to seeing it as a political horse-race?\nEven if the progressive and conservative labels have some value, the right-left divides that we are used to in the secular world don’t perfectly map onto the issues at stake in the church, Rowlands said.\n“It can be very difficult to place these things accurately in a secular register. There is a long tradition of people who are radical on some social and economic issues in a way that would look left-leaning to a secular audience, who are very pro-migrant and critical of capitalism, but who are then morally conservative in other ways, on issues like sexuality.”\n“The secular world is very used to a different kind of political contest,” she added. “But really, the cardinals shouldn’t be going into this process with the names of individuals in mind. They aren’t just choosing a successor to Pope Francis: they’re choosing a new successor to Saint Peter. So the process is supposed to be about coming to a common mind on what that means, and then a name should emerge at the end, inspired by the Holy Spirit.”\nWhat else we’ve been reading\n-\nThis week’s Long Wave newsletter sees Nesrine Malik expertly chart how the global race for the DRC’s minerals caused one of the world’s worst and most underreported humanitarian crises. Annie\n-\nIt is a source of constant amusement that Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s only output so far from a five-year $100m deal with Amazon is a two-part documentary about octupuses. In her review, Lucy Mangan is entertained, enlightened, and a little bemused.

Annie\n-\nOn VE Day, Gary Younge argues, the contribution of millions of people from India, Africa and the Caribbean has been all but forgotten. A commemoration that is “marinated in nostalgia” is based “not so much on a history that is re-membered as dis-membered”, he writes.

Barney Ronay wrote that while the match began with a “slick, luminous, dominant Arsenal away performance”, it was haunted by “the ghost player, the killer Arsenal never signed, the goalscorer to cash in all the fine work in every other part of this team.”\nRugby | Maro Itoje will be named captain of the British & Irish Lions squad to tour Australia on Thursday, the Guardian understands. Itoje will be the first Englishman to lead the Lions in 24 years.\nCricket | Rohit Sharma has retired from Test cricket, his announcement coming hours after reports emerged that he was to lose India’s red-ball captaincy. The 38-year-old, who quit T20 international cricket after leading India to victory at last year’s World Cup, will continue to represent his country in one-day internationals.\nThe front pages\n“Pakistan vows to strike back after Indian missile attack kills dozens” says the Guardian, while the i has “Nuclear warning as Pakistan and India urged to step back from brink of war”. The Financial Times runs with a similar line: “War fears mount after Pakistan vows to hit back at India’s deadly air strikes”. “Iranians ‘plotted to attack Israeli embassy in London’” – that’s the Daily Mail. The Times reports that “All migrants will have to be fluent in English” and the Telegraph complains “£4m a day: True cost of housing migrants”. “Liam leaves £24million ‘to son Bear, 8’” – that’s the Metro. Two wartime children hold union flags the size of themselves on the front of the Express under the banner “Britain remembers the VE Day spirit 80 years on”. The Mirror reprints a 1945 cartoon of a veteran holding a garland that is tagged “Victory and peace in Europe”. The caption reads: “Here you are! Don’t lose it again!”.\nToday in Focus\nIsrael’s plan to ‘conquer’ Gaza\nIsrael plans to expand military operations in Gaza and establish a “sustained presence” there. Bethan McKernan reports\nCartoon of the day | Ben Jennings\nThe Upside\nA bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad\nIn a rare upside to the climate crisis, a new bee species is setting up home in southern England, drawn from the orchards of Europe by warmer springs and earlier flower blooms. The European orchard bee, Osmia cornuta, can usually be found busily pollinating cherry and apple trees in countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands, but more and more are making the once-too-chilly UK their home, with experts saying they expect the population to keep growing. Solitary and brightly coloured, the bee lays eggs inside holes in wood or masonry and then seals up the cavity, so making bee houses from hollow canes is an excellent way of attracting the new arrivals to gardens.\nBored at work?\nAnd finally, the Guardian’s puzzles are here to keep you entertained throughout the day.
