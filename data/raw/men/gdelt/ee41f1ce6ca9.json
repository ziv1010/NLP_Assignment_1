Lyon awaited in the quarter-final stages and but for another error-strewn display from Andre Onana, Man Utd would be taking a healthy advantage into the second leg.\nThe goalkeeper – who engaged in a war of words with Nemanja Matic in the build-up – was at fault for both goals.\nOnana failed to deal with a direct free-kick from out wide for Lyon’s opener before parrying a shot straight into Rayan Cherki’s path for the injury-time equaliser.\nOnana was understandably panned by French outlet L’Equipe when delivering their player ratings. The goalkeeper received a measly 3/10 rating from the outlet who are notoriously brutal with their assessments.\nHowever, Onana was not the lowest rated Man Utd played on the night, with L’Equipe bestowing that dishonour on Rasmus Hojlund.\nThe struggling Dane is enduring a nightmare second season at Old Trafford and was handed a dreadful 2/10 rating for his performance.\nExplaining the lowly figure, the report added: ‘Rasmus Hojlund (2) contributed absolutely nothing to his team. He was easily shut down by the Lyon defence.’\nBruno Fernandes came out on top with an 8/10 rating, while goalscorer Leny Yoro (6/10) was the only other United star to score higher than 5/10.\nHojlund was replaced by Joshua Zirkzee just after the hour mark and the Dutchman showed his fellow frontman how it’s done when heading home in the 88th minute.\nAnd according to a report from GiveMeSport, Hojlund’s days at Man Utd are numbered…\nRasmus Hojlund out, Liam Delap in\nThe outlet stated Amorim now believes signing a potent new striker is the biggest issue that must be addressed within his squad.\nThat reflects poorly on Hojlund who cost a whopping £64m (rising to £72m) when signed from Atalanta in 2023.\nAnd per the report, Amorim has decided enough is enough and is on board with Man Utd selling the striker at season’s end.\nUnited must sell well to ensure they have enough money to address all their needs in the upcoming window. Rather than sign a new striker to compete with Hojlund, GMS strongly suggested the new star will push the Dane out.\nREAD MORE: Top Man Utd striker target Liam Delap will sign if two guarantees made\nResponding to speculation about Hojlund’s future, transfer guru Fabrizio Romano claimed a return to Serie A could be on the agenda.\nSpeaking on YouTube, Romano explained: “In this month, so the first 10 days of April, Italian clubs started calling to understand the situation of Rasmus Hojlund.\n“They have a feeling there could be an opportunity to bring the player back to Italy. United signed him from Atalanta and now he could return to Serie A at the end of the season.”\nAmong the most interested clubs in bringing Hojlund back to Italy are Napoli.\nLatest Man Utd news – Cunha progress, Defender move ‘accepted’, Scholes blasts Onana and Amorim\n🔴⚫️ Man Utd accelerate Matheus Cunha signing; explosive plan B named if deal falls through\n🔴⚫️ Man Utd go ‘all out’ for defensive colossus after shock move ‘accepted’",
