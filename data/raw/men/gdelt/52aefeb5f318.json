  "body_text": "(MENAFN- The Peninsula) The Peninsula\nDoha: Qatar football heavyweights Al Duhail will be looking to secure a place in the AFC Champions League 2022 final for the first time in the history when they take on defending champions Al Hilal SFC of Saudi Arabia in the West Region semi-final, today.\nAl Hilal are seeking to lift the trophy for the third time in four years while Al Duhail are in their maiden semi-final, with the winners set to face Japan's Urawa Red Diamonds, with the two-leg final to be played on April 29 and May 6.\nAl Duhail head coach Hernan Crespo said the semi-final was a great chance for his side to create more history.\n“It will be a very tough game against a great team. But we are also a great team and step by step, we have been rewriting history for our club and we want to keep going.\n“Al Hilal are the defending champions and are greatly experienced but I have been telling my players that if you want to become champions, you must beat the champions.\nAl Duhail head coach Hernan Crespo (left) and Al Hilal head coach Ramon Diaz shake hands after the press conference.\n“Yes, they have a lot of experience. Less than a month ago, they beat Flamengo (in the FIFA Club World Cup Morocco 2022). They then played a great match against Real Madrid (in the final). We have great respect for them but our motivation is to reach the final and we have a great opportunity tomorrow.”\nIt will be a meeting between master and student with Al Hilal head coach Ramon Diaz having been in charge when a Crespo-led River Plate won the 1996 Copa Libertadores.\n“I am very proud to face him because we wrote River Plate history together when we won the Copa Libertadores in 1996. It was amazing and I am very proud to be challenging him. He has had a great career. I respect his achievements and him as a person and it will be a beautiful story tomorrow.”\nCoach Hernan Crespo speaks to Al Duhail players during a training session on the eve of their semi-final.\nHaving said that, Crespo said he will be plotting to end Al Hilal's reign and take Al Duhail to within a match of lifting the AFC Champions League trophy for the first time.\n“Yes, Al Hilal are very strong but we have seen enough to know we have a great chance. We will respect them but we have a strong belief that we can go through.”\nAl Hilal head coach Diaz said he was looking forward to locking horns with Crespo.\n“It is excellent to see two Argentinian coaches in the semi-final. I know Crespo very well. He has good experience and it will be a good challenge. I hope fans from both teams are there to give support,” said Diaz.\nDiaz said Al Hilal are ready to take the next step in defending their title.“The players are in very high spirits and happy to be at this stage. Our target is to defend the title and we are ready for the semi-final.\n“It will be a difficult game but we are a very experienced team and we are focused on playing another high quality game,” said Diaz.\nWhile no surprises are expected in Al Duhail's starting lineup, the vast array of attacking talent at Diaz's disposal means the Argentine will be spoilt for choice in deciding who starts.“We can only use four foreign players, which gives the local players a chance to play and impress. Having said that, any player who comes into the lineup is capable of adding value to the team. That is how Al Hilal are built.”",
