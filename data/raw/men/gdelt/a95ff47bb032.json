  "body_text": "Newcastle United have had a tricky summer in the transfer market and Liverpool have showed an interest in making it even more frustrating.\nThe Magpies have already missed out on moves for the likes of Hugo Ekitike, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo as they look for new arrivals in attack.\nThey are also facing uncertainty over the future of their star striker Alexander Isak, who has made it clear he fancies a move to Liverpool, but has been told he is going nowhere.\nThe Reds are proving a thorn in Newcastle’s side at the moment, creating a distraction for Isak, beating them to Ekitike and have made another move to frustrate the Magpies.\nNewcastle are interested in Brentford forward Yoane Wissa, looking to do a deal for the 28-year-old who is keen on the switch to St James’ Park.\nSky Sports report that Liverpool have shown a late interest in signing Wissa, looking to beat the Magpies to the DR Congo international.\nIt would be infuriating for Newcastle if that did happen, but the report states that a Liverpool move is very unlikely with Wissa set on a deal with Newcastle.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nThe Times report that Newcastle intend on increasing their bid for Wissa to around £30m after seeing an initial offer of £25m rejected by the Bees.\nThat still might not be enough to sign the forward as Brentford were looking for closer to £40m having already lost Mbeumo to Manchester United this summer.\nWith Wissa very keen on making the move to St James’ Park, personal terms will not be a problem for Newcastle.\nYoane Wissa Premier League stats\nApps: 137\nGoals: 45\nAssists: 11\nThe former Lorient forward scored 12 Premier League goals in the 2023/24 season and then improved that to 19 league goals last time round.\nHe has one year left on his current contract with Brentford but the club has an option to extend that by another 12 months.\nNewcastle have also been linked with Porto and Spain forward Samu Aghehowa as they look to bolster their attacking ranks ahead of a return to the Champions League.\nThey also intend to keep hold of Isak, despite the Swedish striker not training with the rest of the squad at the moment.\nThe 25-year-old has made it clear he wants to leave and has not been involved in pre-season so far, but the club have reportedly informed him he will not be moving this summer.\nMore Trending\nAt present there is a stand-off as Isak has been informed he is staying, but he is yet to train with his teammates and manager Eddie Howe cannot see the forward being involved in the Premier League opener against Aston Villa next weekend.\n‘We’ve had discussions and it’s clear at the moment that we can’t involve him with the group,’ Howe said. ‘I don’t know how long that will be for, but that’s the latest.\n‘I’d want Alex to be playing today, I’d want him training tomorrow. We would love the player to be with us. Let me make that absolutely clear. There’s no part of me that doesn’t want that outcome, but I don’t see the current situation changing for Aston Villa.’\nMORE: Crystal Palace stun Liverpool on penalties to win Community Shield for first time ever\nMORE: Liverpool vs Crystal Palace Community Shield TV channel, prize money and extra-time rules\nMORE: Chelsea urged to reconsider ‘problematic’ £50m transfer decision",
