  "body_text": "Canal+ Group has acquired the exclusive broadcast rights to the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Youth League and UEFA Super Cup matches for the 2024/25, 2025/26 and 2026/27 seasons in Poland.\nThe first event to be broadcast by Canal in Poland will be the UEFA Super Cup, which will be played at the National Stadium in Warsaw in August. This will be followed by the first phase of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Youth League, which will be shown on Canal + and on the Canal + online streaming service.\nEdyta Sadowska, President and CEO of CANAL+ Poland, said: “Sport has been in Canal+’s DNA for almost 30 years, and we make sure to offer our Polish viewers the best sporting events and unforgettable emotions. The UEFA Champions League is the best evidence of this, and we are therefore honoured to announce this news to all fans who have been waiting for the return of the greatest European football to Canal+.”\nThe new Champions League format sees the number of participating teams will increase from 32 to 36, and the number of matches from 138 to 204. The increase means that matches will now be played every month from August to Mat.\nFrom the 2024/25 season, the group stage will be replaced by a league phase in which each team will play eight matches – four at home and four away – instead of the current six. From the l/8th final onwards, the competition will continue with the current knockout format.\nAlongside the UEFA Champions League, Canal+ subscribers on Poland will also be able to follow matches from the UEFA Youth League.\nCanal+ also broadcasts all the matches from the PKO BP Ekstraklasa, selected Premier League matches, Laliga EA Sports, PGE Ekstraliga (speedway), as well as matches from the NBA, and tennis tournaments from the WTA Tour series.",
