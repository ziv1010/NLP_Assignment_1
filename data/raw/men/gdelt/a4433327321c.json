  "body_text": "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us once again for live coverage of Graham Potter's pre-match press conference ahead of Chelsea's Premier League clash against Fulham.\nIt's been almost a fortnight since the Blues were last in action – a goalless draw against Liverpool – but that has given Potter time to work with his players on the training pitches and Cobham and undertake team bonding exercises, something needed given the array of new players in the first-team squad.\nThe latest of those is, of course, Enzo Fernandez. The Argentine star arrived on deadline day for a club-record fee of £106.7million. He isn't expected to be thrown straight into the squad against Fulham but we will get the latest from Potter on the midfield star.\nThere will also be updates on the fitness of Reece James and Ben Chilwell, both of whom could be set to return to the first-team squad. Potter will also deliver the latest on the recoveries of Wesley Fofana, N'Golo Kante and Christian Pulisic.\nOur chief Chelsea correspondent Adam Newson will be in position at Cobham. Live updates will appear below.\nFeel like a new start?\nWe've had an unprecedented injury situation. We've hope we've learned a lot and strength from that. Now we can attack the second half of the season and look forward to it.\nMore team news\nMateo Kovacic, N'Golo Kante, Christian Pulisic, Armando Broja and Denis Zakaria are out of the game tomorrow.\nTeam news\nBen Chilwell, Reece James, Raheem Sterling and Ruben Loftus-Cheek are the squad, not 90 minutes. Wesley [Fofana] partly with the team, stepping up next week.\nThoughts on Jorginho departure?\nFor the fourth months I worked with him, he's been fantastic. What he's acheived at this club, but sometimes you have to make a decision and it was something he could secure more stability for his family and it was a win for everyone.\nPressure grows with signings?\nIf you spend money, the external noise goes up. Resources are one thing, but you need to align them, make the right decisions, create an environement.\nDifficult conversations?\nThere will be a few awkward conversations because only eleven can play. You have to be as honest as you can and respect the fact players want to play and compete, but they have to be patient and help the team.\nChampions League squad decision?\nWe've got a bit of time to make the decision but we're aware of who we need to speak to.\nNeed time to shape the squad?\nCoaching is a process, time helps that, but I'm not going to sit here and say we need that. It helps but you guys will talk about time and pressure as we go.\nThoughts on Fulham\nThey've had a fantastic season. Credit to all the staff there, Marco of course, the players have performed well and they are where they are on merit.\nHow was the break?\nWe did some off the pitch activity, a bit of leadership and teamwork, but mostly it's been training and working with the team and how we want to play.\nBig squad now?\nI'm not complaining about it. It's exciting but a test for me and the staff. We have a lot of good players and we have to create an environment where there is healthy competition. Only eleven can play, that is how it is, but it's abuot being ready and supporting the team.\nZiyech, is he happy?\nHe's back in the country and trained this morning. He is a professional player and understands the situation. He is committed to us.\nThoughts on Enzo?\nWe've got to go through the paperwork and gets the clearance and all that. My Spanish isn't great and his English isn't great, but we'll get there. He is an impressive young man and we're looking forward to working with him.\nHow was deadline day?\nI'm the head coach so I don't get too involved in the nitty gritty of deadline day. I am focused on the next day's training and preparing the team for Fulham.\nI've been involved too long to know that there are some things you can't control and I couldn't do anything at that point to change things. I found out when it was done and I'm very pleased, because he is a fantastic player.\nFour exciting Chelsea options for Fulham\nWith transfer deadline day out of the way, Chelsea can finally return to the cut and thrust of Premier League football. The Blues welcome Fulham to Stamford Bridge on Friday night and Graham Potter will have a lot to consider.\nThings did not go too well as west London side fell to a 2-1 defeat and Joao Felix got sent off at Craven Cottage in January but like on that occasion, the Chelsea head coach will have some new options in his squad. Since drawing with Liverpool in their last Premier League outing, the division's most lavish spenders in January have made some further additions.\nA deal to bring Noni Madueke to the club was confirmed on the eve of that match with Fulham providing the first game in which he is eligible, while Enzo Fernandez arrived at Chelsea in dramatic fashion in the depths of transfer deadline day. Furthermore, Potter will not be able to call upon Jorginho after his move to Arsenal\nWith that said football.london takes a look at the changes Potter could make to his Chelsea side to take on their London rivals.\nChelsea news and transfers LIVE\nAll the latest Chelsea transfer gossip, updates and team news ahead of the clash with Fulham as well as more on Arsenal's move for Callum Hudson-Odoi, Thiago Silva's new contract and FFP worries.\nFour transfers Chelsea didn't complete\nChelsea's 2022/23 will be about what did happen and not what didn't. There's already so much to recount and list that trying to factor in things that haven't materialised is almost impossible.\nIn a brief look back there has been: £250million spent over the summer, a catastrophic pre-season, a Champions League-winning manager sacked, an untested top level coach appointed, a remarkable Champions League revival, terrible cup performances, runs of losses to rival the worst in Chelsea top flight history, a mid-season World Cup and finally the most remarkable January transfer window ever.\nSeventeen players have been signed under the new owners for over £500million - and fans were told they wouldn't find another Roman Abramovich. January was as unpredictable as any transfer window on record and to fully digest it takes quite some time.\nChelsea transfer window winners and losers\nThe January transfer window was absolutely relentless from a Chelsea perspective. In similar fashion to the summer window, the Blues did not stop throughout.\nIt brings the total spent on new signings since Todd Boehly arrived at the club to way over £500million, with more than £300million of that coming last month alone. There's been some criticism of the excessive money the club have spent, but it's clear this was all part of Boehly's plan.\nA whole load of incomings – eight to be precise – and a couple of outgoings at Stamford Bridge made for a truly enthralling January transfer window. So, with that being said, football.london analyses the winners and losers with the window now officially closed.\nGood afternoon\nWIth Chelsea in action tomorrow evening against Fulham, it's time for a rare Thursday press conference from Cobham.\nWe'll be joined by Graham Potter shorlty but will have plenty to keep you entertained before then.",
