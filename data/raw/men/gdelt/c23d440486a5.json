He’s going on the self-preservation a little bit, which is unusual for Thomas Frank, I think it’s the first time I’ve ever heard him not take responsibility, full responsibility.’\nNext Spurs manager odds\nMauricio Pochettino – 6/4\nRoberto De Zerbi – 7/4\nXavi – 6/1\nRobbie Keane – 6/1\nRuben Amorim – 10/1\nXabi Alonso – 12/1\nOliver Glasner – 12/1\nEnzo Maresca – 20/1\nMichael Carrick – 25/1\nMarco Silva – 25/1\nBo Svensson – 33/1\nMarco Rose – 33/1\nBrendan Rodgers – 33/1\nCarlos Corberan – 33/1\nErik ten Hag – 33/1\nGareth Southgate – 33/1\nOdds via BetVictor\nFormer Manchester United and England midfielder Owen Hargreaves added: ‘First of all he’s missing his two best players – [Dejan] Kulusevski and [James] Maddison.\n‘I think they’re doing really well in the Champions League but again they had this situation last season, they haven’t invested well and he’s missing his best players, [Mohammed] Kudus as well, so it’s not all his fault.’\nSherwood also believes there is a clear ‘disconnect’ between the supporters and the Spurs squad.\n‘Yeah, they’re in a relegation battle, unfortunately, you can’t dress it up any other way, the table doesn’t lie,’ Sherwood said.\nThomas Frank after Spurs' defeat to Newcastle\n‘I understand the frustration. It has been building up a little bit – last season it was similar playing in Europe and the Premier League.\n‘We need to be resilient, mentally and physically. I am 100 per cent sure that it is a team effort, and it is not only one person. We are all aligned and we know what needs to be done.’\n‘North London derby comes next, it’s not impossible that they can win that game, they would love to win that game because it would give them the confidence to move on, it would obviously upset their neighbours who are favourites to win the title as well which rubs salt in the wounds.\nMore Trending\n‘But it’s not getting any easier, they go away to Fulham after that, then they play [Crystal] Palace, then the games come thick and fast after that.\n‘It’s about confidence, it’s about getting one result and building and bouncing into the next, at the moment they keep losing games, it becomes a habit in the end.\n‘The fans are not with them, there’s a disconnect between the fans and the pitch and this manager, there’s real problems at the moment.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Michael Owen claims ‘incredible’ Man Utd star will be ‘impossible’ to replace\nMORE: Owen Hargreaves tells Michael Carrick to keep ‘brilliant’ Man Utd star on the bench\nMORE: Next Tottenham manager odds as Thomas Frank sacked amid relegation fears",
