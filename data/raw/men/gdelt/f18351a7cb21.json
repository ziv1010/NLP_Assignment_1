After the last three or four seasons it has been about survival.\n'When I started my career, I wanted to play in the Premier League, play for England a go to major tournaments with England and play in the Champions League.\n\"I have played in a major tournament for England, I have played in the Premier League, but I haven’t played in the Champions League. There are still things I would like to achieve before my time is done.\n\"To have the opportunity to decide potentially where that place will be. If it gives me the best opportunity and environment to win and score goals, then that would be the return of me to the England team and playing in the Champions League.\n\"That has been my driver to play at the highest level possible. My representation of that is the Champions League, World Cups, Euros and getting into that bracket of elite players.\"\nCalvert-Lewin, who has only scored 17 Premier League goals in the past four seasons for Everton, last played for England in 2021 after winning 11 caps and scoring 4 goals.\nIn this season's Rumour Mill, he has so far been linked with moves to Newcastle United, West Ham United, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur, with only two of those sides in next season's Champions League.\nReader Comments (138)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

If he did decide to move in 1-2 seasons, we would also get a fee.\nI would still like us to sign an striker with a different characteristics to give the team tactical options, but the pressure would be off.\n7 Posted 09/06/2025 at 12:25:53\n8 Posted 09/06/2025 at 12:46:11\nHe wants Champions League football.\n9 Posted 09/06/2025 at 12:50:21\nLess good for us potentially as it's another body to replace but I'm glad we didn't accede to his high wage demands (assuming there was a genuine negotiation).\nA mixed legacy. Superb value of course and a lot of important goals but also a sense of what could have been if he stayed fit (not his fault, of course) and a bit of underperforming in his last season or two. Plus rumours that he turned down a viable deal with Newcastle last summer, which if true, potentially did us out of £20M — a bit like Ross Barkley.\nAll-in-all, a good player at great value who scored some good and crucial goals that probably kept us up in a tough time for the club. Best of luck to him.\n10 Posted 09/06/2025 at 12:53:39\nI’ll be very interested to see which Champions League club sign him up then!\n11 Posted 09/06/2025 at 12:54:12\n12 Posted 09/06/2025 at 13:03:28\nHoping that Calvert-Lewin will come good is cognitive dissonance of the highest order – he’s just not arsed about Everton anymore. I wish him well in not bothering barn doors at some other club.\n13 Posted 09/06/2025 at 13:12:22\nPickford\nTyrer\nPatterson\nColeman\nO'Brien\nTarkowski\nBranthwaite\nMykolenko\nGana\nGarner\nIroegbunam\nArmstrong\nAlcaraz\nMcNeil\nNdiaye\nBeto\nChermiti\nMassive massive job ahead of Moyes, Kinnear and the recruitment team…\n14 Posted 09/06/2025 at 13:42:30\nRangers or Celtic would be a good fit for Calvert-Lewin seeing as both are in the Champions League.\n15 Posted 09/06/2025 at 13:47:17\n16 Posted 09/06/2025 at 14:11:59\nDo they really get two places in the Champions League?\n17 Posted 09/06/2025 at 14:13:46\n18 Posted 09/06/2025 at 14:25:08\n19 Posted 09/06/2025 at 14:48:38\nRangers have two qualifying rounds to get past before they enter the groups.\n20 Posted 09/06/2025 at 14:51:21\nHe won't be missed much. After one season where Ancelotti divined just how he could be effective – basically, stay in the opposition goal area – he has been almost completely useless and, from observation, it would appear that he also lost any motivation in the past couple of years.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin was best at jumping above opposition players when receiving very accurate crosses from the wings – his feet were just a way of working out which way up he was (a bit like Delaney's donkey's tail) and there has been very little in that department for some seasons.\nHis inability to stay onside was astonishing, and most teams will have worked out that he could be neutralised by a sly step up the pitch, or not reacting too quickly when a through-ball was about to be played.\nSo let's see what can be done with Beto – whose attitude at least is a marked improvement.\n21 Posted 09/06/2025 at 14:54:55\nCeltic's and Rangers' highest earners would be on less than half of Calvert~Lewin's salary.\n22 Posted 09/06/2025 at 14:57:07\nPut yourself on the market, sunshine, and see how many real 'elite' clubs come calling — and if Tuchel comes knocking on your door.\nDespite hardly playing for 3 years, you do miss a hell of a lot of sitters. You've scored a few important goals for us in that time but can I suggest Doucoure has done that more often than you?\nA word of advice: Never think you're better than you are… nor deserve better than you're entitled to.\n23 Posted 09/06/2025 at 14:59:03\n24 Posted 09/06/2025 at 15:10:29\nI can't knock any player for ambition. He hasn't been disrespectful.\nIt's disappointing that he doesn't think he can achieve it with Everton.\nNo ill feeling from me. We move on and thank you for the Palace goal.\n25 Posted 09/06/2025 at 15:18:52\nHa-ha-ha! Good one, Liam. Made me laugh a lot.\nI never thought Calvert-Lewin would stay, as it goes. Beto will be with us next season, either as first or second choice (whatever people think of him). Chermiti will go out on loan.\nSo, another centre-forward will be coming in. I don't have the foggiest who that will be.\n26 Posted 09/06/2025 at 15:23:52\n27 Posted 09/06/2025 at 15:27:24\nI don't knock Calvert-Lewin for injuries either. That can happen to any player.\nBut what annoys me is, if he has made a decision to leave, then to use the fact Everton have been struggling as his reason while he was hardly ever there to help us not to have to struggle. That is just taking the piss.\n28 Posted 09/06/2025 at 15:40:30\nHaving spent the last 3 years of his contract mostly on the treatment table at Everton's expense, you might have expected him to at least sign an extension that would have made the club a few quid.\nHe showed his greed by turning down Newcastle because they weren't matching his demands.\nSorry, Dom, but this shows arrogance not humility.\n29 Posted 09/06/2025 at 15:46:08\nHe's made it quite clear over the last season that he wouldn't sign, and I hope now we look elsewhere to replace him. Even if no one comes in for him, he's snubbed us, so do the same.\n30 Posted 09/06/2025 at 15:48:56\nBut if it's like one of your shots, it would miss.\n31 Posted 09/06/2025 at 16:00:23\nWhy? Pure greed from Calvert-Lewin. As was said, he could have signed an extension last season that would have given a club in financial difficulty some cash.\nGood luck to him? He doesn't need it.\n32 Posted 09/06/2025 at 16:07:42\nBrits are doing well there at the moment.\n33 Posted 09/06/2025 at 16:55:42\nAs it stands, I don't think there's any way he can stay. He's made it clear he doesn't want to be here and some fans have made it clear they don't want him here. This means it has to be best for all concerned if he moves on.\nOur big problem is that nobody we have, and nobody we've been linked with, is anywhere near as good as a fit and in-form Calvert-Lewin. However, as he's rarely been fit and in form for very long whilst with us, I'll settle for someone less talented but more reliable and available. Beto and Chermiti are both decent options, we definitely need to as a third.\nAll of our strikers, whoever they are, will look much better if we can recruit the right quality in the (at least) three players we still need in the winger/attacking midfield positions.\n34 Posted 09/06/2025 at 17:01:53\nEnglish clubs in the Champions League next season. The only one I could think of that might be interested would be Tottenham.\nBut then would Levy, who pulls the strings, be interested in paying out for a striker with an injury record like his?\nIt seems our new owners are more robust than the previous regime. But Levy is absolutely ruthless.\nThe continent might be a good shout Dan @32.\n35 Posted 09/06/2025 at 17:04:51\nTime for a new era. Let's build a squad that has the mentality and ability to challenge every team they play.\n36 Posted 09/06/2025 at 17:07:38\nGood luck to him but we really do need a change of ethic at this club.\n37 Posted 09/06/2025 at 17:16:44\n1. Calvert-Lewin wants Champions League\n2. Man Utd looking to sign Calvert-Lewin on a free.\n38 Posted 09/06/2025 at 17:16:46\nI have defended Calvert-Lewin on here, but I do not think he is in a position to be desiring what he is desiring given his recent performances and injury record over the last few years.\nTeam sports, hey – give me boxing every time!\n39 Posted 09/06/2025 at 17:18:55\nScoring goals a weakness.\nFor someone who clearly likes to use a mirror:\nA pity he is not more self aware.\n40 Posted 09/06/2025 at 17:21:44\n42 Posted 09/06/2025 at 17:41:05\nThe truth is most of us don't know what offers were made and if Calvert-Lewin genuinely turned down a move to the Skunks that lost us a big wedge. It seems quite plausible but it's still hearsay nonetheless.\n43 Posted 09/06/2025 at 17:55:54\nAnd if he wants to play Championship standard with Celtic or Rangers, then good luck to him.\nVery decent player, but what use is he if he only plays a dozen games per season? Whatever people think of Beto, at least he's available every game.\n44 Posted 09/06/2025 at 17:59:47\nI’ve said before, but will say again, I hope we don’t splurge yet on a striker. Beto plus someone with something to prove on loan and we’ll be fine if we bring in 2 quality midfielders, keep Gana, and strengthen at fullback. Hopefully that Chermiti kicks on, or if we buy a striker, make it another in the Chermiti/young-and-cheapish-with-potential, and keep working with Beto and his 10-15 goals in the meantime. If we get more goals from midfield next season, we’ll be fine.\nThanks again, Dom, for wearing the badge with pride.\n45 Posted 09/06/2025 at 18:04:18\n46 Posted 09/06/2025 at 18:25:45\n47 Posted 09/06/2025 at 18:26:13\n48 Posted 09/06/2025 at 18:40:18\n49 Posted 09/06/2025 at 18:40:26\nThe Yellow Submarines qualified for the Champions League, and there is a belief he wouldn't want to trade that for a move to Goodison Park.\nLooks like we have to look elsewhere for a striker. We don't get sorted out soon then we are down from four to two if Calvert-Lewin goes.\n50 Posted 09/06/2025 at 18:43:48\nOut of those 4 strikers, only 1 was fit most of the time anyway!\n51 Posted 09/06/2025 at 19:01:07\n(A) wearing daft clothes; and\n(B) failing to maintain good form when the quality of the team deteriorated sharply, injuries bit and he was left isolated by tactical focus on defence.\nIt's a shame he could never have played the role he was made for - being an excellent option from the bench in a quality side that has a more talented forward.\nHope he goes abroad as it would annoy me to see him playing for a rival.\n52 Posted 09/06/2025 at 19:05:15\nWoltemade would cost Everton less than £20m he's scored 12 league goals.\nBut his team Stuttgart are going to offer him a new and improved deal.\nAnother player we are after is midfielder Gustavo Hamer a bid in the region of £20m is wanted by the blades. But it's strikers we need if DlC goes.\n53 Posted 09/06/2025 at 19:07:25\n54 Posted 09/06/2025 at 19:08:08\n55 Posted 09/06/2025 at 19:12:51\nWe will be left with the scraps again come the last day of the window.\n56 Posted 09/06/2025 at 19:16:27\n57 Posted 09/06/2025 at 19:24:21\nYip, so anyone who is reasonable and can stay fit would actually be a plus point ludicrously!\n58 Posted 09/06/2025 at 19:27:36\nWould it not have been cheaper to offer him an improved contract, considering we'll have to pay in excess of £30M+ to replace him?\nWe bought him for £1.5M, so I can't understand the whinging about him leaving on a free. I reckon he'll go to the Geordies and replace the more injury-prone Wilson, but still on the bench as back-up to Isak.\nSad if he leaves, but wish him all the best, he always gave 100% here, with a smile on his face, and definitely appreciated the fans.\n59 Posted 09/06/2025 at 19:50:39\nThe hearsay and assumptions are not made because of anything by way of supporting facts. The are made simply because people who don't like him want them to be true.\nIt was widely reported that the club turned down a genuine offer for him from Newcastle, but people prefer to believe a report started by one grubby little reporter...\n\"He turned Newcastle down and cost us £20M\"... What???\nDo people really think a club of Newcastle's newfound wealth and savvy would need to risk the punishment for approaching a man contracted to another club when he will be a free agent in a few days and they can talk openly to him?\nThe insinuation that he cost the club £20M is disgusting. A clear attempt to plunge a dagger in his back as he leaves.\nI noticed in his interview that he laughed loudly at the prospect of being out of contract… unemployed.\nPerhaps it's the certain knowledge that he will have more offers and earn more money than all those who have hated upon him for so long, put together... Wherever he ends up.\nAnd they expect loyalty?\n60 Posted 09/06/2025 at 19:52:38\nAn average player when fit… and that not very often.\nIf we are to progress it is this type of mid-table (at the very best) player we must shed. The idea of giving him an improved contract was idiotic.\n61 Posted 09/06/2025 at 20:04:50\nWhichever way you choose to look at it, Everton have offered him a new contract and he's turned it down. That means he's already got offers from other clubs.\nHis favourite film is probably Shaft, because that's what he's (apparently) doing to us. I expect loyalty from a player that's being paid millions, that and 100% effort… not much to ask for, is it?\nI actually like him, and hope he stays, because, when he's fit, we are a better team.\n62 Posted 09/06/2025 at 20:22:49\nThat's possible, he wouldn't have said it unless he legit thinks he is going to one; otherwise, he'll look a plank signing for someone shit.\n63 Posted 09/06/2025 at 20:31:45\nI'll make a deal with you.\nIf you (or anybody else) can put up a single shred of evidence that Newcastle were stupid enough to approach him when he was under contract, especially when they could talk freely to him in a few days, I will put up a public apology and admit I didn't know what the fuck I was talking about.\nProviding... if you can't put up a shred of evidence,you have the decency to come back and admit you are peddling unsubstantiated shite against a player you have long history of denigrating for his fashion sense.\nYou won't of course, because you can't... Neither will anybody else peddling this ridiculous story.\nYou do have my sympathy concerning your disappointment in Calvert-Lewin for not showing you any loyalty though... For the life of me, I don`t understand it.\n64 Posted 09/06/2025 at 20:39:05\nHe's been at the club for close to a decade. He's entitled to move on, just as Everton are. This is the best way for him to get the best opportunity possible.\nGood luck to him. He's been a much more important player to us than many give him credit for.\n65 Posted 09/06/2025 at 20:49:07\nHere is an article from The Athletic (one of the more reliable sources of football journalism) claiming Newcastle were in discussions with Everton over a deal for Calvert-Lewin last summer.\nNewcastle in discussions with Everton over Dominic Calvert-Lewin deal\nAs I said above, we have no idea if this is actually true or, if it is true, why it fell apart.\n66 Posted 09/06/2025 at 21:16:29\nI read that report at the time. It contradicted an earlier report they had put out, so I treated it with the contempt it deserved.\nIf I had a pound for every time The Athletic had pretended to know stuff only to be proved totally wrong, I would be a millionaire.\nI'm glad you had the good sense to admit you had no idea if it was true and didn't try to pass it off as evidence.\nThe idea that any club trying to secretly negotiate with a player contracted to another club would contact The Athletic and risk falling foul of the law is beyond credible.\nI've got to ask: If, as we have established, you don't know... why on earth did you plant the insinuation that Calvert-Lewin had cost the club £20M?\n67 Posted 09/06/2025 at 21:33:57\nLots of sources reported a potential negotiation:\nNewcastle keen to bolster forward line with Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin\nYou asked for a ‘shred' of evidence. What did you have in mind, I wonder?\nIncidentally, The Athletic – whilst certainly not always right – definitely has had some scoops and was one of the first to say we were trying to buy Ndiaye:\nThe Transfer DealSheet: Latest on Man Utd, Arsenal, Liverpool, Real Madrid, Barcelona and more\n68 Posted 09/06/2025 at 21:33:57\nNot Calvert-Lewin cost Everton £20M.\n69 Posted 09/06/2025 at 22:22:28\nYou repeated what you describe as rumour, (The Athtletic driven story) and then you drew the conclusion and made the insinuation that \"if true\", \"potentially did us out of £20M – a bit like Ross Barkley\".\nWhere did you get £20M from?\nCan you point me to those rumours you spoke about claiming that Calvert-Lewin had cost the club £20M before you started it on here?\nAre you saying Everton had accepted a bid for that amount? If so, when? And where were The Athletic when that happened?\nOr are are you saying that Calvert-Lewin entered into secret negotiations with Newcastle illegally without a deal being struck between the clubs?\nThe idea that Calvert-Lewin held illegal private talks with Newcastle and one or both parties decided to share that with The Athletic is absolutely for the birds.\nYou asked what I had in mind when looking for a shred of evidence? How about something remotely credible?\n70 Posted 09/06/2025 at 22:23:43\nCalvert-Lewin, like all players, has to prioritise loyalty to his family and to his own ambition ahead of any football club, and if he thinks he can find a better option for himself at the end of his existing contract, then that is his prerogative.\nWe are all aware that his years at Everton have coincided with chaos and uncertainty on and off the pitch. He has largely fulfilled his youthful promise, and has been instrumental in this club retaining Premier League status over the last four years.\nI won't begrudge him a fresh start if that is what he decides on. We need a fresh start ourselves, and hopefully, if Calvert-Lewin departs, then that will put greater onus on us finding a striker who can prove to be a major asset for the club.\n71 Posted 09/06/2025 at 22:41:33\nDominic Calvert-Lewin exit: Everton ace could bank £20M to join Newcastle\nYou asked for a ‘shred of evidence' that Newcastle made an approach for Calvert-Lewin. I've given 3 different reports. I'm not suggesting that makes it 100% definite but two of the reports are from some of the more credible football sources available.\nObviously the club would not confirm such things until the deal was done so not sure what more evidence you could expect for preliminary discussions.\n72 Posted 09/06/2025 at 22:52:28\nBut anybody who's been watching for the last 3 seasons or so will presumably know of his injuries and decide how much they want to gamble on his future long-term fitness.\nGood luck to him and thanks for your efforts.\nNext!\n73 Posted 09/06/2025 at 22:59:12\n74 Posted 09/06/2025 at 23:08:08\n75 Posted 09/06/2025 at 23:17:52\n76 Posted 09/06/2025 at 23:18:14\n77 Posted 09/06/2025 at 23:25:35\nColin #66, examples please of the many things you say The Athletic got wrong? On the contrary, I've found Boyland to be quite consistently right.\n78 Posted 09/06/2025 at 23:28:19\nHe was signed as a midfield player and has never been a natural goalscorer. When he's through one on he invariably fails to score, the last example being in the last few minutes at Newcastle. His first attempt hit the goalie and his second, from the rebound, was ballooned yards over the bar.\nThe other issue is his appalling injury record. Maybe he can't help that but we simply can't afford to pay huge salaries to players who are regularly out for months on end.\n79 Posted 09/06/2025 at 23:28:31\nAre your powers of intuition as good as you think they are?\n80 Posted 09/06/2025 at 23:53:03\nHis wife is Swiss and may be keen for him to try the continent.\n81 Posted 09/06/2025 at 00:04:22\nI just don't see the issue people seem to have with DCL. Signed almost a decade ago for 1.5M. He's overachieved compared to what anyone might have expected from him at that point. He's suffered terribly with injuries and I really feel for him. He's put in some great shifts for us.\nSeems like quite a nice lad too.\nI might disagree with a few things people post on here, but the attitude towards him has me flummoxed on a completely new level.\nUnless it's entirely about that photo shoot. Which would be really weird.\n82 Posted 10/06/2025 at 00:35:42\nSo Newcastle it is then!\nAnd they'll be in Europe next season which is what he wants.\n83 Posted 10/06/2025 at 00:35:42\nA team can approach a player to discuss signing after following a specific procedure involving a \"Notice of Approach\" if the player is currently registered with another club. This notice must be sent to the player's current club, and they have 7 days to respond or \"waive\" the notice, allowing immediate discussions. That's official rules regarding transfers.\nAlso I would never say you don't know what the fk you are talking about.\nAll as I've said before, opinions, like them or not you have to respect people are entitled to that.\nAgain I hope DLC stays, and yes, I think it was embarrassing for a then 24 year old man to, paid or not, dress as a school girl. But if that's his (bag.) Sam has given you the evidence that Newcastle talked to him and I've given you the evidence that teams are allowed to speak to contracted players.\n84 Posted 09/06/2025 at 00:38:28\nYou used \"rumours\" that DCL had turned down a viable deal to make the insinuation that he cost the club 20m...Yet your latest \"evidence \" from the Goodison News (hehe) doesnt support your claim, it actually contradicts it Read your own \"Evidence\" It clearly states that Newastle DIDNT want to pay a big fee.\nOh and don't try to shift the goalpost, I havent asked for Evidence that Newcastle made an approach for DCL I have asked for evidence that they made an approach TO DCL.\nYou cast the slur on the player claiming \"He turned down a viable deal\" Yet depite your wriggling and twisting You have yet to come up with anything to back that up.\nSo come on I am asking you directly. One more time If the clubs hadnt agree'd a fee which they clearly hadnt...How did the player get to turn down a deal he couldnt possibly have been offered ?\nIf DCL does end up at Newcastle it will be because they bid their time so they didnt have to pay a transfer fee. The player doesnt need to risk breaching the wording of his own contract He just has to keep his gob shut and bide his time too Thats how it works.\nPaul\nI think you`ll ind the club has the right to say \"Fuck off. He is under contract to us and the only way you can talk to him is if you make us an offer we cant refuse.\non the other hand...Perhaps you are right. Perhaps it only makes sense to read part of the rules.... Perhaps Everton were offering him a kings ransome to stay while encouraging another club to come and take him or nothing...Yeah that`ll be it\n85 Posted 10/06/2025 at 01:11:15\n86 Posted 10/06/2025 at 02:13:42\n87 Posted 10/06/2025 at 05:15:37\nUnfortunately Calvert-Lewin was asking far too much salary, so the deal never happened. Minteh went on to sign for Brighton and had a decent season.\n88 Posted 10/06/2025 at 06:47:36\nDCL cost nothing, gave years to this club, was abused (still is) for his lifestyle, was best mates with Tom Davies, another who received the treatment, scored some great goals for us, had to play under the orders of many, truly dreadful managers, did so willingly for the team..\nThe injuries were bad, the stats not great but much of that was due to the tactics employed and what he was asked to do. But that's all forgotten and scurrilous rumors of what he has \"cost\" us are a disgrace. Tha latest set of attacks on his wife are to me, the nail in his coffin.\nI will be sorry to see him go but that's football. Good luck to him, thank you for your service. I hope he chooses his next club carefully.\n89 Posted 10/06/2025 at 06:55:49\nA contract was agreed that the player, injury and other afflictions apart, would make himself available and in condition to play for the club mostly as per the Manager's/Head Coach's instructions for a given period of time at the expiry of which either could dispense with the other. They could have agreed a longer period, get out clauses or possibly extensions provided certain conditions on pay and increases were met but each would have had their own interests in mind, at the very least offer and acceptance.\nIt may be a condition of the League's rules that clubs do not discuss with or make offers to players under contract to other clubs without the current employers (those paying wages) permission but does that include said players Agent, family or just a friendly journalist that somebody from a club just happened to bump into in the local?\nI've been made redundant 3 or 4 times, sacked in almost as many, promoted several times and left for better positions and pay on a few occasions and in some made lifelong friendships, I think it's called part of life.\nThere is now 20 days of that contract remaining at which time the future may become clear but until then, I see that one in number 9 has been at it again.\nHave at it, Ladies and Gentlemen.\n90 Posted 10/06/2025 at 06:59:38\nUnfortunately, that's the life of a Premier League footballer.\nYou take the good things that come with it, and also the bad. If you don't like it, get another profession.\n91 Posted 10/06/2025 at 07:04:56\nI think you're right Alan. My understanding is that if a player is under contract with one club, they cannot be approached directly by another with regards to a transfer.\nThat would need to be club-to-club, to see if the owning club is open to discussing a move. So Newcastle would have had to approach Everton and ask permission to talk to the player and his agent.\nI'm sure there are all sorts of background conversations going on, especially between agents.\nThat's about the limit of my knowledge on the subject. Someone who wants to point out more, will have to dig out the FA rules.\n92 Posted 10/06/2025 at 07:14:27\nIf he leaves now, it will be because of them, of that I feel sure.\n93 Posted 10/06/2025 at 07:23:57\nYou think Calvert-Lewin isn't going to get abused from his next club if he performs like he has for us in the last few seasons?\nI can guarantee he will; not saying it's right… but it will happen.\n94 Posted 10/06/2025 at 07:31:41\n95 Posted 10/06/2025 at 07:36:56\nNow he will hopefully achieve his ambition of playing Champs League.\nIt irks me a little that players let themselves off the hook when blaming their teammates for lack of success. It's collective responsibility and if Dom had hit the target more often instead of the keepers shins, then he might have been poached by a rival.\n96 Posted 10/06/2025 at 07:48:12\n97 Posted 10/06/2025 at 07:55:02\nFrom the outset I've said that these were only rumours whose veracity we can't be sure of and yet you're desperate to stir the pot by alleging 'some really, really snide comments' and 'casting slurs' on the players and \"The insinuation that he cost the club £20M is disgusting\".\nThere are multiple reports that Newcastle entered into talks with Everton over DCL. Here's yet another (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/06/24/newcastle-transfers-pull-out-calvert-lewin-deal-everton/) If these talks did not progress there are presumably only a few good reasons why. Either Everton wanted a higher fee, which is plausible but then they knew they stood to lose him a year later and desperately needed the cash from a PSR standpoint. Or Newcastle changed targets (they didn't bring in another first team striker last summer, only the youngster Osula). Or DCL turned down their wages knowing he'd be a free agent the following summer and could demand a high signing on fee.\nI didn't even say that I thought the last option was most likely. I just said it was plausible; which it is. And if he did do that then that's totally within his rights, you're keen to paint me as someone who'd 'plunge a dagger in his back as he leaves.' but I wished him good luck. I like the player. I was only discussing his legacy and part of that will inevitably be conjecture as to why his move to Newcastle didn't happen.\nYour language is aggressive and ad hominem (not for the first time); I've no problem with you disagreeing but I've no interest in a fight, so I'll leave you to it at this point.\n98 Posted 10/06/2025 at 08:01:21\nI have left jobs for higher wages, I have done my bit and walked away.\nFans are the only people involved in football who are loyal. Everyone else takes from the club.\nRegarding the abuse. It's a common thing now for anyone in the public eye. In his wife's situation, do you think she posted stats about her husband naively thinking people would agree?\nI am not condoning the abuse, I just think the noises from his camp over the last 12 months have made him out to be some sort of victim.\nIn reality, he has earned millions, courts the media, lives a Cheshire jet-set life, and has hardly kicked a ball for us in 2 years.\nWhoever gets him next had better make sure they have a spare treatment table for him — or his wife might take to socials again!\n99 Posted 10/06/2025 at 08:02:17\nWe will soon find out but, if he's going, it's time for Everton to concentrate on who we are going to bring in.\n100 Posted 10/06/2025 at 08:04:34\nWe also see the blame Calvert-Lewin is getting on here for having hamstring injuries, it's called football and I wish him the best, whatever he decides. I enjoyed watching him play for us, he owes us nothing.\n101 Posted 10/06/2025 at 08:27:46\nRead Christine's post very slowly and please try to understand what she is saying. This is not about a mans ability. Its about long concerted abuse. Its about nasty innuendo. idle nasty gossip.\nIt was insinuated by Sam in post 9 that DCL turned down a move costing us 20m. Trust me that was not done to show the player in anything but a bad light.\nBy the time Paul Kossoff 31 comes along it had become fact. He copies Sams slur and tells us it down to DCL's Greed.\nSam decides to take up the challenge to provide evidence that DCL had actually had an offer to turn down, but, by putting up a whole load of reports about Newcastle's interest in him, He was only putting up what the cats and dogs in the street knew. He has offered not slightest piece of evidence which would remotely suggest that the player had turned anybody down. Despite his best efforts.\nPaul K then comes along with further \"evidence\". Apparently ANY club can enter negotiations with any player simply by giving his current club a weeks notice - Sigh\nIt was therefore no surprise at all when you came along and told us that you were \"sure\" DCL had scuppered a different deal by demanding too much. By now it had become Toffeeweb FACT.\nDCL is as guilty of costing the club 20m as he was of burning down all those orphanages and killing those nuns.\nThe Bastard\n102 Posted 10/06/2025 at 08:36:58\nIt was reported in the press about the swap deal between us and Newcastle, and why it didn't happen. If the press are lying, I will apologise.\n103 Posted 10/06/2025 at 08:41:41\nGood luck to Calvert-Lewin with whatever he decides to do.\n104 Posted 10/06/2025 at 08:48:17\nLeading the charge with no one behind or alongside him. The defence still on the 18 yard line with the midfield not far in front of them. Dominic looking at the parting of the Red Sea behind him.\nAnd it's not just the time out with injuries. Don't underestimate the time it takes to get back to match fitness after a lengthy spell out.\nThere is a difference between training and playing competitively. It takes time to oil the rust. Some players have better recovery times than others.\nPeople pay their money and are entitled to their opinions on players, just like on here.\nThere is a history of developing \"targets\". We are not alone in that, most clubs will have them.\nLeon Osman and Tony Hibbert are examples. Two fine servants and Osman, a great technically gifted player. Although I never sensed it as much inside Goodison.\nMichael Keane has come in for a lot of stick. Justifiably for a lot of his performances over the seasons. Myself included. Nothing that a few special goals can't sort out.\nJack Harrison this season.\nI can only speak for myself, but we sometimes groan or express surprise before the match when the team selection is announced, but once they cross the line and that whistle goes, I don't really care who is playing.\n105 Posted 10/06/2025 at 08:50:30\nThese are the first reports I have heard that Dominic turned them down and they don't make sense. Whereas a club without Champions League football with PSR tight could not have afforded to pay 3 hefty striker salaries in the current climate.\n106 Posted 10/06/2025 at 09:03:53\nNone of us have inside information. So anyone claiming certainty on either side is likely blowing hot air.\n107 Posted 10/06/2025 at 09:10:15\nAre you the resident wind-up merchant for TW?\n108 Posted 10/06/2025 at 09:12:10\nThings could very well have gone a different way last season, but he'd have been okay cos he took the transfer fee we might have got and stuck it in his back pocket.\nIt will be a relief once he's out the door.\n109 Posted 10/06/2025 at 09:16:31\nThis is a fairly simple situation. He's absolutely entitled to field offers. Everton are entitled to make one, should they wish.\nI don't think either party deserves criticism. Both have stuck to their word. Both have given a lot of time to the other. Both have acted fairly and reasonably. And now both are doing what they believe is in their own best interest.\nOur support really seems to be falling into this social media age of there always being goodies and baddies. Like you show how much of a fan you are by how riled you get by every possible situation.\nI'd like to ask that Dom gets a little respect, but how about having a little bit for yourself?\n110 Posted 10/06/2025 at 09:20:46\nHere is one such report, attributed from The Telegraph:\nNewcastle star cost club £7m after 'refusing' transfer before Callum Wilson ruined swap dealDominic Calvert-Lewin 'involved in swap deal talks' after Newcastle star 'refused' to move\n111 Posted 10/06/2025 at 09:24:17\nCalvert-Lewin is not a good footballer! He looks the part, athletic in stature and moves gracefully across the turf… but put him in front of goal and he's next to useless.\nI know he's had his injuries but, even when fit, his goal return is woeful.\nI remember Kevin Gallagher playing for Newcastle and Blackburn – extremely injury-prone but, when fit, he scored a lot of goals.\nIf Calvert-Lewin fell off a ship, he'd miss the water.\n112 Posted 10/06/2025 at 09:25:14\n113 Posted 10/06/2025 at 09:26:00\nMy main issue s with certain people saying Calvert-Lewin is leaving because of the abuse from fans. Good luck in finding a club that don't have a fan base that does the same. Abroad, fans storm the training ground.\nBut good luck wherever you end up.\n114 Posted 10/06/2025 at 09:26:49\nTony,\nI wouldn't bet against him going to Newcastle. In the absence of fact, applying common sense is usually the best option open to us.\nA player in the last throws of his contract is in the driving seat. He doesn't have to turn down anything. He simply has to sit tight and keep a dignified silence. Leave it to others to drive themselves crazy peddling and recycling rumours.\n115 Posted 10/06/2025 at 09:28:54\nDave [111] sums it up.\n116 Posted 10/06/2025 at 09:29:19\nDon't forget, clubs and managers can be just as ruthless. For those old enough to remember, Howard Kendall visited Andy Gray personally, after being decisive in helping us win an FA Cup, the league and ECWC, to tell him he'd bought Gary Lineker and he was no longer required.\nEverton has already done it with a number of players and the U21s/U18s. Surplus to requirements, services no longer required, we're restructuring etc. It happens in all forms of employment.\nAs supporters, we are unconditionally emotionally attached to Everton. Not all players are, although they'll always have affection, once they've been here.\n117 Posted 10/06/2025 at 09:33:16\nYou have a manager who has constantly been an open admirer of the player and has been linked with moves over several windows.\nThen you have a club in Newcastle who have little wriggle room with PSR and 2 highly paid centre forwards at the club.\nAll these three statements above are facts — not 'blowing hot air'. You are correct that no one knows with any degree of certainty but that's the case in everything we read.\nNow we had one poster on another thread claiming that Beto and Barry and Kean and Calvert-Lewin are all comparable strikers and used some Mickey Mouse analytical site as proof of them to be. I would say that's the very definition of blowing hot air!\n118 Posted 10/06/2025 at 09:38:25\nOf course it's not unique to us and Calvert-Lewin. Apparently the social media platforms of Norway are crashing under the volume of abuse levelled at Trent A-A who has let down the RS and their supporters by allowing his contract to run down and leave on a free.\n119 Posted 10/06/2025 at 09:39:05\nIt was worth coming on here to read your last sentence! 😂\n120 Posted 10/06/2025 at 09:44:32\nI trust we have a replacement lined up.\n121 Posted 10/06/2025 at 10:03:08\nSure, it's very plausible that Newcastle didn't feel they could match the wage demands of Calvert-Lewin because they already had Wilson etc. But it remains true that we don't know exactly what happened, as you agree. I only ever offered possibility on the subject and gave many qualifications.\nAs for FBref, you may not like it, but I prefer a site that has actually tried to do a little bit of analysis.\nFeel free to offer your own analysis on that subject but don't expect me to believe something is true just because it's your opinion.\n122 Posted 10/06/2025 at 10:34:10\nI think he might have been hoping/expecting that playing the second half of the season fully fit would seen him score enough goals to make him a highly attractive free agent. Instead, the injury will just have reminded everyone of his recent injury record.\nI said at the time it happened that this was unfortunate for him because it would have seriously impaired his market value. The idea of a Premier League club in the Champions League spending big money securing an injury-prone striker who rarely scores is unlikely and he is vanishingly unlikely to be first choice in such a team.\nPresumably our own offer reflects the reality of the risk he brings and, given he is not exactly being chased hard, I suspect other clubs are equally jaundiced. He'll pick up a club for sure, even if it is just a newly promoted one, but I think his chance of a last big pay day got blown earlier this year.\n123 Posted 10/06/2025 at 10:39:51\nIf Gana Gueye doesn't sign the contract hes been offered, will he get the same treatment?\n124 Posted 10/06/2025 at 10:47:01\nIt's very sad that people struggle so much to differentiate between their opinion and fact and the validity of their opinions which aren't sacrosanct. The decision now is 100% the Club's to make. The outcome is then in the lap of the Gods.\nIf I had to give an updated wish, it's that Calvert-Lewin leaves and makes a clean start at another club. The best option for the club though (simple economics) is that they can reset things, get him fit and playing at his best again, and that is very good, and save wasting money on a £40M forward which is an area where much is wasted.\nThe only people who have the information necessary to make a good decision are at the club though not on TW. I trust the club to make the right decision.\n125 Posted 10/06/2025 at 10:54:32\nHow many clubs without Champions League football have 3 high-earning centre-forwards at the club? It was common knowledge that they needed to shift Minteh so they could keep Guimares as they were in danger with PSR.\nEven before the Minteh swap was mooted, Newcastle were hoping to bring in a striker to compete with Isak and offload the injury-prone Wilson.\nSo, even if Calvert-Lewin wasn't 'being greedy', they still would have needed to find a suitor for Wilson who, like Dominic, was in the final year of his contract and held all the cards.\nYes I chose to believe a report centred around facts and realities and plausibility rather than one which is just supposition and even if true (we don't know for certain) doesn't even mention Wilson, which some reporter with so-called knowledge you would have thought proffer was lined up to go to X club.\nSam, for someone who claims to know a lot about players and is confident enough to put detailed research in front of what can be quite a challenging audience, surely you can see what my nephew of 8 could tell you about Kean's and Calvert-Lewin's strengths and weaknesses and how much they differ.\nI think you dug yourself a hole with Colin and it's now a case of the pot calling the kettle black.\n126 Posted 10/06/2025 at 11:02:10\nHere is what we know:\n1) there were various deal permutations for a move for Dominic to Newcastle last summer;\n2) A swap involving Minteh and /or a straight purchase for Dominic were mooted;\n3) It didn't happen.\nEverton may have wanted the player exchange plus cash; Newcastle may have wanted the player exchange plus cash; Newcastle might have been unwilling to meet Dominic's wage demands; or they may have need to get a striker's wage off the bill to accommodate his wage demands, as Conor says. All possible scenarios.\nNewcastle will almost certainly have approached Dominic's agent to test his appetite for the move before making a formal approach to Everton. Also, all clubs plant stories in the media if they think it will help their transfer negotiating position.\nDominic had a nominal transfer value if sold by Everton last summer, whether it was £20M or less. He does not any more – this can only advantage him in terms of wages at his next club.\nMy personal view is that he has earned the right after 9 years at the club to run down his contract and leave on his own terms.\n127 Posted 10/06/2025 at 11:09:59\n“The truth is most of us don't know what offers were made and if Calvert-Lewin genuinely turned down a move to the Skunks that lost us a big wedge. It seems quite plausible but it's still hearsay nonetheless.”\nNot sure why that is so controversial. If we only posted about confirmed facts, the transfer window would be a huge bore.\n128 Posted 10/06/2025 at 11:29:21\nI'm not sure why you put 'being greedy' in quotation marks. I never said that. You can believe whatever reports you want. I'm glad we agree that neither of us knows the truth.\nThere is no hole. I said there were rumours that may colour how people remember Calvert-Lewin. That is palpably true from this thread alone.\nAs for your umbrage about Thierno Barry, I've never claimed to know a lot about players. I enjoy stats, many don't. You're welcome to stick to your nephew's opinions, each to their own.\n129 Posted 10/06/2025 at 11:32:57\nI've never claimed to know the truth of it or called him greedy or any such thing. He's more than entitled to do what he sees fit financially in my view at any rate.\n130 Posted 10/06/2025 at 13:51:29\nOn a site where you know there is a large anti-Calvert-Lewin group, you peddled what you claim was a \"rumour\". One which you knew would show The player in a bad light and one which you knew would gain traction – as proved to be the case.\nIt could have been left at that, but when the challenge was put up for somebody to put up a shred of evidence that Calvert-Lewin cost the club £20M because he turned down this mythical offer, it was you who came back. It was you who put up 4-5 different attempts to prove there was no smoke without fire – the fire you yourself had had lit way back in post 9.\nYou then had the nerve to accuse me of stirring the shit for exposing and questioning this most shit stirring of posts. Rich... Very rich.\nYou say you don't want to fight with me. Let me assure you, the feeling is mutual. I issued your challenge. You had your chance to provide your evidence.\n131 Posted 10/06/2025 at 13:54:12\nDidn't they have to sell Anderson to Forest, and Wilson was injured, and he wasn't going anywhere, so we don't know what rumours were true?\n132 Posted 10/06/2025 at 13:57:12\n133 Posted 10/06/2025 at 14:03:11\n134 Posted 10/06/2025 at 14:40:06\nNewcastle we're going to give us Philogene as part of the make-up for Calvert-Lewin. As Dom refused the move, the player exchange fell through and Philogene then went to Ipswich for a cash offer.\nSo in a way, Everton lost out for a player, similar to the way we got Iroegbunam for Dobbin to get round PSR with Villa. Without concrete proof, Calvert-Lewin turned down the wage offer from Newcastle.\nBut I do remember he met with Newcastle officials or his agent did and the move was called off.\n135 Posted 10/06/2025 at 23:07:23\nHe will make more money leaving and signing on a free — last decent contract for him this is.\nIn saying that, it would be a big surprise to me if he finds a club that will pay him a basic £90k per week.\n136 Posted 12/06/2025 at 18:54:33\n137 Posted 12/06/2025 at 19:29:13\nPersonally, I don't think he's worth a new contract. Good luck to him with whatever club he find but Everton have to move on from him. The sentimentality shit show has to stop.\nEverton are bigger than any player or manager. Move on, for fuck's sake, and maybe that will calm everyone down here and stop people jumping down each other's throats.\n138 Posted 12/06/2025 at 19:32:38\nBastards the lot of em!\n139 Posted 12/06/2025 at 19:46:38\nWe missed out, he's lively.\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
