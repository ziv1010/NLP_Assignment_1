  "body_text": "Tuesday’s briefing: Moyes likes Everton fight after Gueye red for slapping Keane\nEverton boss David Moyes hailed his side’s fighting spirit as they clung on to beat Manchester United at Old Trafford despite the bizarre early sending-off of Idrissa Gueye.\nJamie Carragher has jumped to the defence of beleaguered Liverpool boss Arne Slot – but admits he has some way to go before he is regarded as highly as his predecessor Jurgen Klopp.\nMeanwhile, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has apologised for berating a cameraman after his side’s loss to Newcastle, while Marcus Rashford has earned praise from Barcelona manager Hansi Flick.\nMoyes refuses to criticise Gueye over bizarre red card\nDavid Moyes refused to condemn Idrissa Gueye for his bizarre red card as Everton clung on to beat Manchester United 1-0 and give the Scot his first win at Old Trafford as a visiting manager.\nGueye saw red 13 minutes in to the game, squaring up to team-mate Michael Keane and slapping the defender as they argued over a mis-placed pass which gave Bruno Fernandes a shooting chance he could not convert.\nThat left Everton under the cosh but Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s fine 29th-minute goal gave them a lead, then they fought doggedly to defend against an increasingly frustrated United side who saw a five-game unbeaten run come to an end.\n“When I saw it I didn’t think there was anything in it,” Moyes said. “I was a bit annoyed they were challenging each other but I was also quite pleased they were fighting each other because it shows me they cared.”\nCarragher says talk of Slot removal is premature\nJamie Carragher says Liverpool boss Arne Slot does not earn the same kind of “unconditional love” afforded his predecessor Jurgen Klopp but insists any speculation over the Dutchman’s future at Anfield is premature.\nPressure has continued to mount on Slot in the wake of his side’s dismal 3-0 home defeat to Nottingham Forest on Saturday which extended their recent run to six defeats from their last seven Premier League matches.\nCarragher told Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football: “To win a league title in your first season is pretty special, but I have the feeling he (Slot) doesn’t have the unconditional love and support like Jurgen Klopp always had.\n“It’s the nature of the beast, he’s the manager of one of the biggest clubs in the world, but for me there should be no talk or thought of this manager being out of a job this season.”\nGuardiola apologises for cameraman bust-up\nPep Guardiola feels “embarrassed and ashamed” of his conduct after confronting a cameraman in the aftermath of Manchester City’s Premier League loss at Newcastle on Saturday.\nThe City manager reacted angrily after he was filmed in close proximity following the final whistle, when he was involved in animated discussions with Newcastle captain Bruno Guimaraes and the match officials on the field.\nGuardiola, who was pictured grabbing the camera operator’s headset, had been riled by the decision to award Harvey Barnes’ winning goal in the 70th minute at St James’ Park.\nSpeaking at a press conference on Monday, Guardiola said: “I apologise. I feel embarrassed and ashamed when I see it. I don’t like it. I apologised to the cameraman after one second.\n“I am who I am – even (after) 1,000 games, I’m not perfect a person. I made a huge mistake. What is for sure, I defend my team and my club, that’s for sure.”\nBarca boss hails happy Rashford\nBarcelona manager Hansi Flick said a “change of atmosphere” has done Marcus Rashford good following his loan move from Manchester United.\nFour of his six Barca goals so far have come in the Champions League and the move to the Nou Camp has gone some of the way towards resurrecting a career that had stalled at Old Trafford.\n“I’m happy to have him in the team, playing for Barca,” said Flick. “I’ve followed him throughout his whole career and I’ve always been impressed by his quality and what he can do in the box, and he’s showing that in Barcelona.\n“That change for him, new football, in Barcelona, with good weather. For me it’s incredible to see how he’s always smiling. That’s the atmosphere we have and it’s very good for him.”\nWhat’s on today\nRashford heads for Stamford Bridge as Chelsea face Barcelona in the Champions League, while Manchester City welcome Bayer Leverkusen and Newcastle travel to Marseille. Coventry look to extend their stunning Championship season as they head to fellow promotion hopefuls Middlesbrough.",
