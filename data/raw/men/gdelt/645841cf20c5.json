The team will now give its report on CAT-3 technology. Based on the report, permission will be sought from the Air Force to install the system on the runway of the airport.\nPrayagraj airport director, Rajesh Kumar, said that since Maha Kumbh will be held during winters, there will be dense fog at the airport. In view of the festival, the movement of aircraft here will increase. To ensure smooth landing of planes in dense fog, it is necessary to install the CAT-3 system.\nHowever, the arbitrariness of the aviation companies continues to trouble the passengers these days. The fresh case pertains to IndiGo which has reduced the number of days for the flight between Prayagraj and Bengaluru. Now the flight will run only four days a week. Not only this, Indigo has also increased its minimum fare to Rs 6,500.\nPrayagraj-Bangalore flight has been operating continuously since 2018. Out of all the flights operated from Prayagraj airport, the maximum number of passengers were for this route. For this reason, the passenger load of this aircraft always remained more than 80%.\nAccording to the new schedule of Indigo, this aircraft will now operate on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday and Friday, whereas there will be no movement of the aircraft on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.\nIt has also been implemented with immediate effect. Due to a reduction in the number of trips, its fare has also increased. The minimum fare for this aircraft has also become Rs 6,500, whereas earlier its minimum fare was between Rs 5,000 and Rs 5,500.\nAirport advisory committee member Shivshankar Singh says that reducing the trips is beyond comprehension. This is the situation when Prayagraj airport has an average traffic of 50,000 passengers every month.\nWe also published the following articles recently\nAir India and IndiGo cancel flights to Dubai amid airport flooding\nHeavy rains in Dubai caused flight disruptions to/from India, affecting Air India, IndiGo, others.
