I've never seen a centre forward move as much as her. It's not just a single movement. It's double movement,\" said Chelsea manager Emma Hayes.\n\"Her energy levels - it's like she's a 12-year-old. It's infectious. But I don't know a striker in world football that can do what she does. She's the best.\"\nKerr's decisive goal came after Villa's Alisha Lehmann had fired inches wide at the other end - and the Swiss winger had another chance later on but fizzed it across the face of the goal in the 77th minute.\nChelsea were forced to hold on in the latter stages as Villa pushed desperately for an equaliser, with full-back Sarah Mayling striking the post, but the Blues held their nerve to reach another final.\nThey will meet Manchester United at Wembley on 14 May after the Red Devils' dramatic late victory over Brighton on Saturday.\nChelsea find a way to win… again\nThis was not a vintage Chelsea performance but the Blues have been in this position several times before this season and usually found a way through.\nThey did so again on Sunday although Villa gave them a real test in the second half, creating a number of chances and building pressure in front of a crowd of more than 5,000.\n\"I think the game played exactly the way I thought it would,\" said Hayes.\n\"Villa were tremendous and gave everything to the game. That pitch is difficult to play on. I thought we looked quite leggy and Villa threw everything at us.\"\nOn-loan Manchester United winger Kirsty Hanson was the hosts' most dangerous outlet, causing havoc on the left and putting crosses into the box which team-mates Daly, Kenza Dali and Lehmann failed to capitalise on.\nBut Chelsea did enough to ensure their quest for a third successive FA Cup crown continues - and they remain in the hunt for three trophies this season.\n\"My players were absolutely outstanding and I thought were the better team if I'm really honest,\" said Villa boss Ward.\n\"We are heartbroken. It's hurting a lot because I thought we did enough to win the game. We just didn't put the chances away.\n\"It was probably about having calm and composure in those moments but we have been exceptional up to this point in the season and the players have given everything.\"\nJelena Cankovic hit the post within minutes of the restart in the second half and Kerr was denied one-on-one with goalkeeper Hannah Hampton in the final seconds of stoppage time - but Villa had the best of the chances in between.\nUnder manager Hayes, Chelsea have won three of the past five FA Cups and the holders will face a United side at Wembley who will be competing in their first major final.\nIn the meantime, the Blues' attentions turn to the Champions League where they face Barcelona in the semi-finals, while they remain in a four-way battle for the Women's Super League title.",
