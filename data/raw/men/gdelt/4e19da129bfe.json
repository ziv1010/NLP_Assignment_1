He would be a short-term signing but he will add leadership qualities, depth and winning experience to the side. Furthermore, he will be available on a free transfer and the move could prove to be a bargain for Tottenham.\nMats Hummels would be a useful addition\nMeanwhile, Chelsea are looking to bring in a quality central defender as well.

The 78-cap German international has the quality and the experience to replace the Brazilian and it remains to be seen whether the Blues can secure agreement with him.\nSigning a player of his quality and experience on a free transfer would be a major coup. Tottenham and Chelsea will have to improve the other areas of their squad as well and signing the German international a free transfer would be ideal.\nMeanwhile, Newcastle have been alerted to his availability as well and it remains to be seen whether the Magpies decide to make a move for him.
