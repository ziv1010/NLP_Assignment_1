  "body_text": "Thiago Silva injury: Progress & potential return date for Chelsea defender\nChelsea's misery under Graham Potter continued on Sunday afternoon as they fell to a 2-0 defeat at fierce London rivals Tottenham.\nThe Blues were once again profligate as their win-less run extended to six games in all competitions. They haven't won a single game of football since 15 January, scoring a measly six Premier League goals since November.\nIt's bleak in west London, and a potential spell on the sidelines for defensive fulcrum Thiago Silva will not help their cause.\nThe Brazilian has been nothing short of majestic since joining the club in 2020, and his absence is the last thing Potter needs right now with a potentially job-defining Champions League tie on the horizon.\nWhat injury did Thiago Silva get against Tottenham?\nSilva injured his left knee after making a last-ditch intervention on Harry Kane in the opening exchanges of Sunday's encounter at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nThe defender tried to continue before opting to be replaced by Wesley Fofana.\nBeIN SPORTS reporter Carrie Brown tweeted that Silva wasn't 'visibly limping' post-match, adding that he wasn't wearing anything on his injured knee either.\nWhat has Graham Potter said about Thiago Silva's injury?\nThe under-pressure Chelsea boss had little to say regarding the Brazilian's injury.\n\"Hopefully it's not too serious but I haven't spoken to the doctor enough to have a diagnosis yet,\" Potter explained in the wake of Sunday's defeat.\nWhat Chelsea games could Thiago Silva miss?\nBrown's post-match report would suggest Silva's injury will not keep him out for a prolonged period. It did look like an impact injury.\nThe Blues are back in Premier League action at home to Leeds next Saturday before their crucial Champions League second leg against Borussia Dortmund the following Tuesday. Potter will want to have Silva available for that tie, so the Brazilian could sit out the visit of Leeds as a precaution.",
