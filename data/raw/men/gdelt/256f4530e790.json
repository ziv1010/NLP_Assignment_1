But who exactly is he? FourFourTwo explains...\nWho is Dermot Desmond?\nDesmond is the current largest individual shareholder in Celtic Football Club and has been since 1995.\nDesmond held shares in Manchester United until 2005 when he sold them to Malcom Glazer and he is regarded as the ninth-richest man in Ireland.\nWhen a new manager needs to be appointed, like the current situation, he is the one making the calls and ultimately making the final decision.\nHe is quite withdrawn and not often spotted in the public eye, but he has lurched into the spotlight in the last few days.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nThere's been a rift between the board at Celtic and the fans for several years, with the fans dislike often voiced during games with chants aimed at those in charge of making decisions at the club.\nRodgers, it could be argued, has added fuel to the fire in recent years, and it has lead to a fallout with Desmond, and ultimately to his resignation.\nDesmond has unleashed a very public attack of Rodgers in the last day, and has accused him of whipping up distain towards the board.\nIn a 551-word statement Desmond stated, \"his words and actions since then [private meeting between the two] have been divisive, misleading, and self-serving. They have contributed to a toxic atmosphere around the club and fuelled hostility towards members of the executive team and the Board.\"\nIt remains to be seen if Desmond is looking to take a more public facing stance at Celtic now Rodgers has left, especially in the manner of his departure.\nEwan is a freelance writer and social media manager who has worked for The Athletic, GOAL, 90min and OneFootball. From Gelsenkirchen to Riyadh, he has covered some of the biggest games in football in his three years in the industry.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name.",
