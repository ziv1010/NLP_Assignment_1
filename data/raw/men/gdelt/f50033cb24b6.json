  "body_text": "All the worrying signs something was wrong with Pep Guardiola as he 'splits from his wife after 30 years together': From that bizarre scratching incident to ranting at fans... is this why Manchester City are struggling?\nPep Guardiola has been worrying Manchester City fans with weeks of poor results and unpredictable behaviour before yesterday's shock revelation that he has split from his wife after 30 years together.\nBut now observers are asking if his relationship troubles could be behind the strange outbursts including a joke about self harming and several furious rows with fans on and off the pitch.\nManchester City's form has nosedived and now it has emerged that he and his wife have reportedly split up having lived in different countries for five years.\nUntil this season this 860 mile separation - Pep in Manchester and his Cristina in Barcelona with their three children - coincided with a golden age for City and its boss.\nBut last night it emerged that Mr and Mrs Guardiola have reportedly decided to end their marriage, although friends have said it is 'friendly and cordial' and they spent Christmas together with their children Maria, 24, Marius, 22, and Valentina, 17.\nIn recent months City went on the worst run in their manager's golden career after a record four straight Premier League titles and a historic Champions League win.\nOff the pitch Pep has been involved in a series of spats off with football fans who have upset him by asking him for autographs or goaded him after defeats. There has also been problems with players, including Kyle Walker's love life drama and speculation about the future of players such as Jack Grealish and Kevin De Bruyne.\nThere were also worrying comments about self-harm after he admitted scratching his own head and face until it bled during the final moments of City's collapse against Feyenoord in November. He also spoke of the loneliness of football management as City slumped to sixth in the league with six losses, including four in a row.\nGuardiola's assessment may have taken on greater significance amid reports in Spain emerged on Monday that he has separated from his wife Cristina Serra after 30 years. They met when they were 18, in 1994, and married in 2014.\nAnd while his place as one of football's greatest coaches is undisputed, despite a poor start to this season, the grief of splitting with his wife, his childhood sweetheart, will also have been causing him more pain.\nPep Guardiola was left with a number of cuts and marks after Man City's draw with Feyenoord. He admitted he scratched himself and made comments about self harm, which he later clarified\nPep Guardiola has reportedly split with his wife Cristina Serra (pictured in the Caribbean in 2022) after 30 years together\nFootage shared online last night showed Guardiola blasting autograph hunters and told them not to approach him again, swearing at them\nA video showed Pep Guardiola confronting a football fan before he is held back by two men after defeat to Liverpool\nPep Guardiola arrived at a London hotel ahead of Man City's clash with Brentford on Tuesday\nGuardiola was seen wearing his wedding ring as Man City players arrived at their London hotel\nOff the pitch rows\nFootage emerged last night of Pep Guardiola launching into an X-rated tirade against serial autograph hunters who targeted him for signatures near his home.\nHe also had to be dragged when goaded by a Liverpool fan and was angry when he was stopped while enjoying a solo bike ride in Manchester.\nIn the autograph row Guardiola told the middle-aged men to 'go back to school' as he vented his annoyance at their actions while going about his day in Manchester city centre.\nDressed in a stylish hoodie and tracksuit combination, an animated Guardiola waved his arms as he warned: 'Don't come again, I won't tell you again, I know your faces.\nPep Guardiola launched an X-rated tirade against serial autograph hunters who targeted the Manchester City manager\n'Do you know what is lost' shouted Guardiola as he was steered away\n'Go to school and prepare yourself guys. You are young guys so don't be here, wasting time,' Guardiola told the awkwardly-stood trophy hunters clutching replica shirts.\n'Do you want to live your life doing this honestly,' he added. A despondent individual could be heard quietly replying 'No, I used to be a chef' while the six-time Premier League winning manager continued his rant.\nGuardiola continued: 'Let's continue to do it. Prepare better. F***ing hell man, this isn't for all the people this is for you.\n'What are your dreams? Tell me, what is it? Where do you dream my friend? Practice, f***ing hell, practice,' he added while attempting to urge the bystanders to clear out from the area.\nThe Man City boss had seen his side surprisingly upset by rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup final last May, with the Spaniard later showing his frustrations in a confrontation after the match with a Liverpool fan.\nA video emerged in December of the confrontation, months after the incident occurred, with Guardiola needing to be held back after being heckled in Manchester.\nPep shows six fingers to Liverpool fans - a nod to their league titles - when they were being beaten at Anfield a few months ago\nThe goading supporter had said 'right mate, just 'cause you lost', perhaps due to not being acknowledged as Guardiola walked by.\nAt that point Guardiola turned around and approached the individual recording the video before being restrained and led away.\nGuardiola could be heard in the video saying 'do you know what is lost?' multiple times before he is led away by two members of his entourage.\nThe Man City boss, who is in his 12th consecutive year of management without a break, insisted he felt refreshed ahead of the new campaign when on Man City's tour in the United States.\n‘If you love what you do, why should I stop?’ he said in July. ‘I like it – as much (now as when) they hired me – so let’s go.’\nSelf harm joke\nThe City boss was seen frustrated in the dugout after his side threw away a three-goal lead\nGuardiola had prompted concerns during the run after appearing with scratches on his forehead after his side threw away a 3-0 lead to draw with Feyenoord in the Champions League.\n‘Yes, it's from my nail on my finger,' Guardiola replied when asked about the cuts. 'I cut myself with my fingernail (during the game).\nHe then stated as he left his press conference 'I want to harm myself’, before quickly issuing an apology for the statement on social media.\n'I was caught off guard with a question at the end of a press conference last night about a scratch which had appeared on my face and explained that a sharp fingernail had accidentally caused this,' Guardiola wrote on social media.\n'My answer was in no way intended to make light of the very serious issue of self harm.\n'I know that many people struggle with mental health issues every day, and I would like to take this moment to highlight one of the ways in people can seek help, by calling the Samaritans hotline on 116 123 or emailing jo@samaritans.org.'\nWife left Manchester for Barcelona five years ago\nGuardiola and Serra had remained a couple despite not living in the same city (pictured in Munich in 2013)\nGuardiola, 53, and Serra first met in 1994 before marrying in an intimate ceremony in 2014\nGuardiola and Serra, who married in an intimate ceremony on the outskirts of Barcelona in 2014 have now decided to part ways.\nThe couple, who met in 1994, had been living apart for more than five years after Serra moved back to Barcelona with one of their three daughters, Valentina, 17, while Guardiola remained in Manchester.\nThey have two other children together: Maria, 24 and Marius, 22.\nGuardiola and Serra, a Brazilian journalist and writer, had remained a couple despite not living in the same city and have regularly been pictured together in the years since.\nSpanish outlet Sport reports that the decision to end their marriage was made in December, with only members of their inner circle aware of the split. Their trusted friends and family have also been told not to disclose any further information, according to the publication.\nGuardiola and Serra met while the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss was modelling for designer Antonio Miro in the shop in the Spanish city.\nThey began a long-distance relationship when Guardiola was a footballer, before they bought a home together in Barcelona. The couple later moved to Germany when Guardiola was manager of Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich.\nSerra decided to leave Manchester in 2019 to help oversee the fashion company owned by her family, Serra Claret, which stocks several brands the City manager is often seen wearing. Guardiola also makes regular trips back to Spain to see his wife and their children.\nSport stated their relationship is 'totally cordial, stable and friendly' despite the split.\nSerra was in Istanbul in June 2023 to congratulate her husband after City beat Inter Milan in the final of the Champions League to seal a famous Treble.\nThey were also pictured together attending Wimbledon at the All England Club in July.\nGuardiola had often spoken publicly about his wife. In January 2024, he said: 'My wife is the best in the world at many things, especially fashion.\n'She says normally to me, don't wear this or wear that, so I follow. I'm smart enough to know when people are much better than me, follow their advice.'\nIn May 2023, Guardiola said: 'When I have five days [off] for example, yes [I can switch off from football].\n'I went to Barcelona [after Real Madrid] for example to see my wife, my little daughter. That helps me. But with every three days, there's no chance.'\nPlayer problems\nGuardiola cut a frustrated figure as he spoke to the media ahead of Man City's trip to Brentford on Wednesday.\nThe Spaniard appeared visibly irritated as he was asked about Kyle Walker - who stunned the club by telling them he wants to leave - and City's January transfer targets.\nWalker, 34, was left out of City’s squad for Saturday’s 8-0 rout of Salford City, after which manager Pep revealed he had requested to ‘explore the option’ of playing abroad.\nWalker, who nearly joined Bayern Munich 18 months ago, is understood to have informed the club of his wish to leave last Thursday.\nHe is said to favour a move to either of Milan's clubs, AC or Inter.\nManchester City captain Kyle Walker, pictured with wife Annie in 2019, has asked for permission to discuss moving abroad before the transfer window shuts at the end of the month\nLauryn Goodman is in a £2.4million house in Sussex which Kyle bought for her and their two children, Kairo, four, and 18-month-old Kinara, to live in\nThe Saudi Pro League was reportedly a tempting option for Kyle. After all, the money is jaw-droppingly good - Cristiano Ronaldo is widely reported to be earning an annual salary of £173million playing for Saudi side Al Nassr.\nThe sorry sequence of events that has culminated in one of football's biggest-ever scandals began in 2019 when, while on a break from Annie, Kyle got Lauryn pregnant with Kairo. He and Annie got back together shortly afterwards and married.\nBut in the winter of 2022 Lauryn was once again pregnant with Kyle's baby and the following summer, his only daughter was born.\nOn December 27 last year she messaged Annie with a breezy bombshell, writing: 'Hey it's Lauryn, I just wanted to quickly tell you that Kyle is the father of our daughter.'\nAnnie threw Kyle out of their £4million Cheshire mansion two weeks later. And in July it emerged that Lauryn had made some lavish demands from him as part of her maintenance agreement, which prompted Judge Hess to accuse her of treating him like an 'open-ended cheque book'.\nOne example was a £32,000 astroturf pitch for Kinara, who at the time of the hearing had just turned one.\nBut Kyle and Annie appear to have successfully put their troubles behind them and enjoyed a 'wonderful' family Christmas together at their home after she allowed him to move back in last summer.\nAnd now friends believe that a new start abroad with their four sons Roman, 12, Riaan, eight, Reign, six, and Rezon, six months, is just what they need.\nOne tells me: 'A change is as good as a rest and it would be the best thing for them to go off and start again abroad, so they can make new memories and try to leave some of the awful times behind.\n'It is so appealing and is actually understandable why Kyle decided to request the permission to look at going overseas. Obviously though, they just hope Lauryn doesn't follow them there.'\nManchester City was ordered in November to pay Benjamin Mendy £8.5million in unpaid wages after he was acquitted of rape.\nMendy, 30, was accused of raping a woman at his £4m mansion and attempting to rape another woman, but was cleared of the charges at a retrial in July 2023.\nThe Frenchman, who joined City for £49m from Monaco in 2017, had his £500,000-a-week wages withheld after being charged with sex offences and remanded in custody in August 2021, and he subsequently took the Premier League club to an employment tribunal.\nTribunal judge Joanne Dunlop ruled that Mendy was entitled to around £8.5million.\nBenjamin Mendy (pictured) was acquitted of rape and attempted rape at a retrial last year\nMendy's statement in full after winning his legal battle with City\nThe tribunal heard that City continued to pay Mendy after his first arrest in November 2020, but changed their stance when he was re-arrested the following year.\nThere have also been rumours about an exodus of stars amid financial fair play concerns and Pep looking to rebuild the team.\nCity's talisman Kevin De Bruyne has faced a difficult season plagued by injury.\nThe midfielder's current contract is set to expire at the end of this season and he has yet to agree a new deal having been at the club for the past nine years.\nSaudi Arabian clubs have previously signalled interest in luring De Bruyne to the nation under the guise of what would be an incredible salary hike and the player is permitted to hold discussions with foreign clubs regarding a potential move this month with no deal yet signed to extend his stay at City.\nThe reigning Premier League champions are keen to keep De Bruyne in Manchester with him becoming one of the world's best midfielders during his time at the club.\nCity boss Pep Guardiola is keen to keep hold of De Bruyne past the end of the season\nAsked about the progress of contract negotiations with City, De Bruyne told Sky Sports: 'I don't care.'\nThere have also been concerns about Jack Grealish's future, who appears to be at his lowest ebb at the Etihad.\nPep Guardiola has said he knows that Grealish can get back to his best, but right now he is being played out of the team by summer arrival Savinho.\nGrealish was left out of the England squad for the Euros and instead shared numerous snaps with his Instagram followers enjoying the sun on holiday\nThe Man City star and his childhood sweetheart welcomed their baby daughter in September\nGrealish's emergence as a creative maverick at a struggling Aston Villa side, and his perceived 'party boy' antics as a youngster, drew comparisons to English football royalty like Paul Gascoigne.\nTwo seasons ago, when Man City at last topped the football world with a staggering Treble, Grealish was at the heart of it all, his connection with goal-devouring behemoth Erling Haaland crucial to his side's universal dominance.\nHe played almost 3500 minutes of football across 50 games that season, and was at his creative best as one of City's key stars, playing 90 minutes in all but one of his side's Champions League knockout games en route to the crown.\nBut is now in and out of the side.\nContract U-turn\nPep Guardiola agreed a two-year contract extension at Manchester City until 2027. he had been expected to move on\nPep Guardiola was widely expected to leave Manchester City - but changed his mind and signed a new deal.\nSome have now pondered whether this was because his marriage has ended.\nFootball experts have said he is an obsessive who will now want to rebuild the team now it is highly unlikely they will win the Premier League again in 2024/25.\nAmid the worst run of Pep Guardiola's managerial career last month, the Spaniard revealed how his family were his first port of call when coming to terms with defeat.\nThe 53-year-old, who had seen his Man City side fall off the pace in the race for the Premier League title, then made the stark reflection on the loneliness of life as a manager.\n'The starting point with coping with the problems of defeat would be being with people, your family basically,' he said.\n'But no-one can really console the loneliness of the football manager. You have people beside you but the bad decisions, why have I done that, it's gone wrong because I did this, I didn't push them enough... the pain of the defeat, you feel it alone.\n'You might have friends around you, but when you close that bedroom door and turn off the light there's no consolation.'\nPep Guardiola has cut an increasingly troubled figure on the Manchester City touchline as this campaign wears on\nMail Sport reported in May that Guardiola was expected to view this season as his last at Man City, having presided over a spell of unprecedented dominance with 15 trophies in eight seasons.\nGuardiola was considered to be exhausted after masterminding Man City's fourth successive Premier League title and sixth in seven years.\nHe had spent the close-season playing golf, visiting his dad in Catalonia and enjoying a dinner with his former players from Barcelona B, the first team he coached.\n'You are always tired at the end of a season but when you take a break you bring energy back,' he reflected in August. 'To work better, you have to disconnect. It is necessary to relax your mind, do other things. Otherwise there is a moment it doesn't work.\n'I have learned that. Before I was like, \"I have to work\". No, sometimes resting means you are working better.\n'Sometimes I am tired and in that moment, I don't work. I rest. And after rest, I am ready to work harder and better,' he added.\n'Not all the time I am happy or have the energy to work, that is why I have staff to help. Before it was not like that, I felt I had to do all of it, and it's not productive.'\nRest has proved hard to come by since, with Man City having had a gruelling fixture schedule, while Guardiola has seen his side struggle both domestically and in the Champions League this season.\nMan City suffered four consecutive defeats in November, which saw his side fall off the pace in the Premier League and exit the Carabao Cup, before the relevation Guardiola had agreed to extend his contract further.\nGuardiola confirmed Mail Sport's story from May that he was expected to leave next summer but suggested that a decisive display of commitment was required during City's tricky run of form to send a message.\n'Since the beginning of the season I've been thinking a lot,' Guardiola said. 'I thought that (this season) should be the last one.\n'But with the problems we had in the last month, I felt that now is not the time to leave. I would have let the club down.\n'I felt that I could not leave now. Simple as that. Maybe the four defeats was the reason why and I felt that I cannot leave. I felt the club still wanted me and the fact we're still together so I signed.'\nThe expected lift from Guardiola's contract extension failed to materialise, with Man City going on an eight match winless run, the worst sequence of results of the Spaniard's managerial career.\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured",
