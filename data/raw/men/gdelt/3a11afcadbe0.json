Both deals will be difficult to make, not least because the respective players are valued over the £100m mark.\nNow, a fresh report from the Manchester Evening News has doubled down on the striker signing claims. However, they also revealed Ten Hag wants a brand new central midfielder and given the impact he’s made, is likely to get his wish.\nFirstly, Kane and Osimhen are both cited by the MEN, though there are two other No 9s on the club’s radar.\nBenfica’s Goncalo Ramos, 21, and Ajax’s Mohammed Kudus, 22, are the players in question.\nTen Hag is reportedly ‘impressed’ by Ramos who’s returned 27 goal contributions in 32 matches for Benfica this season. He also scored a hattrick at the World Cup in Portugal’s 6-1 thumping of Switzerland.\nKudus, meanwhile, would arguably be the lowest profile addition of the quartet. However, he’s a known commodity to Ten Hag given their shared time at Ajax and Ten Hag reckons Kudus has the game to thrive in the Premier League.\nThe MEN state United’s decision-makers have ‘prioritised’ the striker signing, though Ten Hag is demanding a midfield addition too.\nSuperstar midfielder to be second Man Utd signing\nOn that front, two tantalising names are cited – Frenkie de Jong and Jude Bellingham.\nUnited famously courted De Jong for month after month last summer. Barcelona were willing to sell and woulde be again 12 months on, though the Dutchman did not want to leave.\nTen Hag is deemed ‘open’ to a renewed De Jong push. Perhaps acting in United’s favour this time around is the club’s remarkable resurgence under Ten Hag as well as the ability to offer Champions League football (barring a late-season slip).\nBellingham, meanwhile, will be difficult to sign given the likes of Liverpool, Man City and Real Madrid are all way ahead in the transfer race.\nTo help fund the moves and to conform with Financial Fair Play, multiple exits could be sanctioned.\nAmong the highest profile are Harry Maguire and Anthony Martial who are both understood to be up for sale. The MEN add if club captain Maguire does leave, a new centre-back would bring United’s summer recruitment drive to three.\nMaguire has fallen behind Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez in the pecking order this term. What’s more, left-back Luke Shaw has been deployed out of position at centre-half on multiple occasions.\nThe Daily Mail recently reported United are ‘resigned’ to generating no more than half the £80m they paid if Maguire does depart.\nWest Ham are an early contender for his signature, per ESPN.\nTRANSFER GOSSIP: Man Utd to ‘blow Arsenal out of the water’ for incredible £100m-plus transfer; Man City table forward offer amid audacious Barcelona loan plan",
