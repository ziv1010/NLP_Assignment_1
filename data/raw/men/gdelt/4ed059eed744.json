KHALID MUBARAK AL-SHAFI\nLiverpool’s Mohamed Salah (left) attends a team training session.\nLiverpool: Mohamed Salah reported for Liverpool training yesterday as doubts grow about the star's future at the Premier League champions with Saudi clubs intent on making a move for the striker in the winter transfer window.\nThe 33-year-old Egypt forward was left out of Liverpool's squad for their Champions League tie at Inter Milan yesterday following his extraordinary public criticism of Reds manager Arne Slot after he was left on the bench for the third consecutive game.\nSalah said after the 3-3 draw with Leeds on Sunday that he felt like he had been \"thrown under the bus\" by Liverpool and no longer had a relationship with Slot, sparking reports that Liverpool's third-highest goalscorer in history could be on his way out of Anfield in January despite signing a lucrative new contract in April.\nSalah's outburst has piqued interest in Saudi Arabia with a source at the kingdom's Public Investment Fund (PIF) telling AFP it will do \"whatever it can\" to buy him.\n\"We follow Salah's position thoroughly and believe there can be a move either by loan or buying his contract,\" the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\nAsked at a pre-match press conference in Milan on Monday whether Salah, who has scored 250 times for Liverpool since signing from Roma in 2017, had played his last game for the Reds, Slot replied: \"I have no clue.\"\nThe Saudi source said there were \"no direct negotiations or talks with the club at the moment but there will be a move at the right moment\".\nThe PIF source said the Gulf monarchy wanted to sign the Egyptian winger in January to join stars such as Cristiano Ronaldo in the Saudi Pro League.\nPIF holds a 75 percent share in Al-Hilal, Al-Nassr, Al-Ahli and Al-Ittihad, but the source said it was not alone in wanting the Arab world's biggest football star.\n\"There is a competition inside the Saudi league who will bring Salah,\" the source said. All players have their ups and downs. Salah is just 33 and has a lot to do here,\" insisted the PIF source.\n-\nStrong winds, blowing dust forecast from Sunday: Qatar Meteorology\n-\nMandarin Oriental, Doha celebrates dual five-star recognition at Forbes Travel Guide 2026 Star Awards\n-\nMinistry of Municipality launches 34 e-services for livestock sector\n-\nAl Attiyah, McInnes top times on Jordan Baja Prologue\n-\n‘Stability offers investment confidence as Qatar poised for further growth’",
