  "body_text": "With only a few games left of the 2023/24 Premier League season, Newcastle United are still in with a chance of finishing high enough to qualify for another European campaign next season.\nThough it’s unlikely to be in the Champions League again, given how bad their injury situation has been for much of the season and where they found themselves in the table as recently as a couple of months ago, the Europa League or at worst Europa Conference League, will feel like a well-deserved end-of-season bonus.\nThe summer transfer window is looming like a dark shadow in the background, however, and the Magpies will understand that one big name will perhaps have to be sold in order for the club to comply with the Premier League’s Financial Fair Play rules.\nBruno set to stay at Newcastle?\nBruno Guimaraes has long been thought to be a player that could earn the club a pretty penny in transfer fees thanks to his reported £100m release clause, even if Eddie Howe has never once considered that it would be the Brazilian that’s the odd man out when the time comes to say goodbye to a major star.\nFortunately, Guimaraes has dropped a major hint as to where he will play after this season, and it would appear to be good news for Newcastle fans.\nAccording to The Telegraph (subscription required), the player has bought a new luxury £4m house in Northumberland, which he intends to move into with his wife and children.\nOf course, in football nothing is ever set in stone, but if the St. James’ Park faithful were looking for a show of commitment from the player to put their collective minds at rest, he’s certainly done that.\nNow the ball is very firmly in the Saudi Public Investment Fund’s court as they look towards planning for next season and trimming the wage bill and player numbers where possible.",
