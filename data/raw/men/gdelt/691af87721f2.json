Metropolitano on Wednesday night as Atletico Madrid play host to Lazio in their final group-stage fixture.\nJust one point separates these two teams, who have already qualified for the last 16, with Los Colchoneros at the summit sitting marginally ahead of their Italian counterparts in second place.\nA year on from their disappointing group-stage exit from the Champions League, Atletico Madrid have punched their ticket to the last 16 with a game to spare this time around after winning three and drawing two of their first five Group E matches.\nDiego Simeone‘s side only need to avoid defeat against Lazio on Wednesday to finish top of their group for the first time since 2016-17.\nFor the first time in three years and for just the third time in their history, Lazio have secured their spot in the Champions League last 16 after accumulating 10 points from their first five group-stage matches this season.\nMaurizio Sarri‘s men know that in order to leapfrog Atletico Madrid to top spot in Group E, they must beat the Spanish side on their patch on Wednesday, something that Lazio have not achieved since March 1998.\nA closely-fought contest between two evenly-matched teams is set to take place on Wednesday, just like the reverse fixture three months ago, although Atletico will be regarded as the favourites to win on home soil.\nConsidering Atletico’s solid home form and Lazio’s recent troubles on the road, we believe that Simeone’s men will do enough to grind out a slender win in front of their own fans and secure top spot in Group E.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk\nDortmund welcome PSG in a mouthwatering tie\nAn already-qualified Borussia Dortmund welcome a Paris Saint-Germain side still fighting for their right to enter the Champions League last-16 draw in Wednesday’s mouthwatering Group F finale.\nWhile the hosts only require a point to confirm first place in the group, Luis Enrique‘s men will leave their qualification hopes up to chance with anything other than victory at the Westfalenstadion.\nSince commencing this year’s Champions League ‘group of death’ with a disheartening 2-0 loss to their upcoming opponents at the Parc des Princes, Borussia Dortmund have outlined their European credentials and ensured a place in the knockout rounds with a third successive continental win on matchday five.\nBoasting a respectable 10 points from a possible 15 in the group phase thus far, Dortmund will be present in the last-16 draw no matter what transpires this week, although their three-point lead over PSG leaves them at risk of being bumped down to second spot if they lose to Enrique’s side.\nClean sheet-less away from home in the Champions League for over three years, PSG will likely have to fight fire with fire once again if they are to keep their dreams of a first top-level European crown alive, but Enrique has the resources at his disposal to do so.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk\nNewcastle United and AC Milan in neck-to-neck fixture\nThe St James’ Park faithful will don their black and white scarves for a momentous Champions League occasion on Wednesday night, as Newcastle United and AC Milan fight for the right to reach the knockout rounds.\nNeck-and-neck in the Group F standings with five points to their name, the Magpies currently have the edge over the Rossoneri on goal difference, but both sides still need results elsewhere to go their way if they are to dine at Europe’s top table that little bit longer.\nIt is not all doom and gloom for the third-placed hosts just yet, though, as Newcastle still possess the superior head-to-head tally against PSG – who are only two points better off – so victory on Wednesday coupled with Les Parisiens’ failure to beat an already-qualified Borussia Dortmund would send Eddie Howe‘s team through.\nAny other scenario would either force the Magpies down to Europa League football or send them packing from the continent entirely.\nMilan will have their own intentions of capitalising on their hosts’ perpetual injury woes to keep their last-16 hopes alive, and Newcastle’s last two Premier League results offers Pioli’s side reason for optimism, but with the vibrant Tyneside troupe behind them, we can envisage the Magpies edging a thrilling contest before an anxious wait to learn their fate.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk\nBarca must avoid defeat at Royal Antwerp to be crowned group winners\nChampions League Group H leaders Barcelona head to Royal Antwerp‘s Bosuilstadion on Wednesday evening simply needing to avoid defeat to advance to the last 16 of the competition as group winners.\nMeanwhile, the Belgian upstarts are only playing for a small sliver of pride on the final matchday, having failed to pick up a single point across their five top-level European contests thus far.\nIn order to deny Barcelona a guaranteed first-placed ranking in Group H, Antwerp must therefore achieve a desirable club first by earning their maiden point – or points – in the Champions League, but even a shock victory on the Bosuilstadion turf may not be enough to knock La Blaugrana off their throne.\nBoasting three-point advantages over Porto and Shakhtar – who square off in their pivotal encounter this week – Barcelona could potentially be usurped by the latter team if they lose to Antwerp and there is a seven-goal swing in the Ukrainian side’s favour, although such an outcome is highly unrealistic.\nA few Barcelona fans may be keeping a more watchful eye on Vermeeren’s performance rather than their own team on Wednesday evening, as their visit to Antwerp’s turf should be a foregone conclusion from the first whistle.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk",
