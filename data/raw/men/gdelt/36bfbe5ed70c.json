Barcelona wins 9-goal thriller\nBy JAMES ELLINGWORTH AP Sports Writer\nLiverpool became the first team to guarantee a place in the last 16 of the new Champions League format by beating Lille 2-1 on Tuesday, while Barcelona fought back from two goals down to stun Benfica 5-4 in a thriller.\nHarvey Elliott’s bouncing, deflected shot gave Liverpool its seventh win from seven games, just after 10-man Lille had equalized following Mohamed Salah’s opening goal.\nLiverpool needed a point at Anfield to be sure of reaching the round of 16 as one of the top eight teams in the league stage, skipping the playoff round for teams ranked ninth to 24th.\nSalah raced through in the 34th minute to sweep Liverpool ahead with his 22nd goal in all competitions this season. And when Lille’s Aissa Mandi was sent off just before the hour mark, Liverpool looked certain to extend its 100% record in the league phase.\nBut Anfield was stunned when Canada striker Jonathan David converted from close range to level the score in the 62nd. It didn’t take long for Liverpool to regain the lead through Elliott’s deflected effort five minutes later.\n“All my life I’ve dreamt of playing Champions League football, not only for my boyhood club but to play here at Anfield in front of our fans and especially to score, it’s kind of a pinch-me moment,” Elliott said.\nBarcelona’s comeback win\nIt was a night of high drama in the Champions League with 33 goals scored across nine games. Nine of them came in Barcelona’s battle with Benfica.\nRaphinha scored in stoppage time to complete a rousing comeback as Barcelona won in Lisbon despite having been 4-2 down with less than a quarter of an hour remaining.\nBenfica’s Vangelis Pavlidis scored the third-fastest hat trick at the start of a Champions League game, with two of his goals coming after errors by Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. Barcelona stays second with 18 points from seven games, and is now unbeaten in six games in all competitions since the new year.\n“We came with the mindset that we could turn the game,” Raphinha said. “We never gave up and managed to grab a win.”\nRobert Lewandowski scored two penalties for Barcelona to stay the Champions League’s top scorer on nine goals, one ahead of Raphinha, who also scored twice.\nAnother Spanish club staged a comeback as Julian Alvarez scored a 90th-minute winner to lift Atletico Madrid past Bayer Leverkusen 2-1. Atletico lost Pablo Barrios to a 23rd-minute red card and went into half time 1-0 down to a Piero Hincapie header for Leverkusen.\nAlvarez scored in the 52nd and had the momentum when Hincapie was sent off for a second yellow card, before Alvarez struck again to take the win and lift Atletico to third.\nVilla slides out of the top eight\nWith Prince William watching on, Aston Villa’s hopes of automatic qualification for the round of 16 took a blow after a 1-0 loss to Monaco.\nVilla led the standings early in the league phase of the competition after winning its first three games. But defeat to Monaco left the Premier League club eighth. Wilfried Singo’s goal at a corner in the eighth minute was enough to secure the win for ninth-place Monaco.\nDortmund slump continues\nBorussia Dortmund’s 2-1 loss at Bologna increased the pressure on coach Nuri Sahin in Dortmund’s fourth consecutive loss at the start of the new year in all competitions.\nSerhou Guirassy gave Dortmund, last season’s runner-up, the lead with a chipped penalty and ran to celebrate with Sahin.\nIt looked like the Champions League could provide a much-needed boost for a team floundering in the Bundesliga, but two goals in two minutes from Thijs Dallinga and Samuel Iling-Junior changed the game for previously winless Bologna.\nResults elsewhere meant Bologna will be heading out of the competition despite its win, since the Italian club can’t finish in the top 24. Sturm Graz and Red Star Belgrade are also out after losing Tuesday.\nAtalanta beat Graz 5-0, strengthening the Italian club’s push to qualify directly for the round of 16. Atalanta finished the evening fourth.\nPSV Eindhoven hung on for a 3-2 win at Red Star despite losing defender Flamingo to a red card just after halftime while leading 3-0. Stuttgart eased to a 3-1 win over Slovan Bratislava, which was already eliminated and has lost all seven of its games. Club Brugge and Juventus drew 0-0.\nEuropa League\nIn the only Europa League game of the night, Galatasaray missed a chance to go third in the table, giving up a 3-1 lead to draw 3-3 with last-place Dynamo Kyiv.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.",
