  "body_text": "Real Madrid are expected to be active in the transfer market next year and they have already set their sights on a Manchester United target.\nThe arrival of new manager Ruben Amorim will bring new players to the club, the players who can play the football style that the Portuguese manager is trying to deploy at the club.\nOne of the players Man United have on their shortlist is Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez.\nDue to the constant injury issues suffered by Luke Shaw, Man United are targeting a move for Kerkez.\nThe Red Devils are likely to sign a new left-back as early as the January transfer window.\nHowever, they will struggle to sign Kerkez now as they will have to compete with La Liga and Champions League winners Real Madrid.\nAccording to Real Madrid Confidencial, the La Liga side are keen on signing the Bournemouth defender in order to strengthen their options at left-back.\nKerkez has impressed with his performances at Bournemouth, and his versatility, defensive stability, and ability to contribute to the attack make him an attractive option for top clubs looking to reinforce their full-back positions.\nReal Madrid, in particular, could be interested in strengthening their left-back spot, where Ferland Mendy has struggled with injuries, and younger talent like Fran García is still finding his footing.\nIt’s clear that both the clubs are monitoring his development closely and his potential move could create a transfer battle between the two European giants.\nMan United are desperate for a new left-back\nMan United’s problems in the left-back position are evident as not only Shaw but Tyrell Malacia has also struggled to stay fit.\nThe Red Devils have mostly used a right-back in the left-back position; Diogo Dalot.\nReal Madrid’s interest is not good news for Amorim’s side as the La Liga giants usually get what they want in the transfer market.\nThe Red Devils would be encouraged by their summer signing of Leny Yoro, for which they had to beat Carlo Ancelotti’s side and they successfully did that.\nKerkez is one of the best players in the world in his position at the moment and for a player of his age, there is still a lot of room for improvement.",
