The eccentric Argentine had led Leeds back to the top flight after a long absence and engineered a top-half finish in the first season following promotion but their form collapsed in 2021-22.\nThe 67-year-old has a lengthy CV, having managed the Argentina national side, Espanyol and Athletic Bilbao in Spain, Marseille and Lille in France and Lazio in Italy.\nRenowned for his attacking style of football based on hard running and supreme fitness, David Ornstein's report in The Athletic suggests that Bielsa is not universally favoured on Everton's Board.\nOriginal Source: The Athletic [Â£]\nReader Comments (243)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Ferguson would have the fans on side but if results don't improve immediately would he struggle? Dyche for me.\n6 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:16:44\n7 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:17:12\n8 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:17:19\n9 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:18:14\nI thought Delia Smith might be on the list.\n10 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:18:19\n100% relegated if he comes in, but it would be hilarious watching this squad try to play Bielsaball.\n11 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:19:14\n12 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:22:49\nFor all those Danny Ings fans, we'll he's injured and out for a month at least.\n13 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:24:14\n14 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:28:44\nWhy the fuck would managers who are \"successful\" with their current clubs come to us.\nGet fucking real will you, they wouldn't touch us with a shitty stick. Forget this we are Everton and a big club, we are not.\nWe are a fucking train wreck called Everton.\n15 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:32:05\n16 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:32:25\nAt least we will not continue to sleepwalk into the Championship. Get it done, then onward and upward.\n17 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:33:05\nI think if I hear another Everton fan saying they feel sorry for Frank, I will combust. The guy has been here 12 months he very nearly got us relegated last season and this season he has us joint-bottom of the Premier League.\nHe will walk away with between ٣-7 million in compensation and on top of that has been paid a fortune to make us a complete disaster. I heard Kevin Campbell on Sky Sports News saying he needed to be backed; he was given in excess of 㿲 million to spend â€“ compare that to what Silva has spent at Fulham or Frank has spent at Brentford and both teams sitting comfortably in the Premier League.\nNow rumour is that we are talking to Bielsa, is this the same Bielsa who had to carry out all his press conferences with an interpreter, and whose team got beat virtually every week? How is that an improvement on Lampard?\nThe reason Leeds sacked him was because they were heading for relegation; yes, they played with a lot of energy but still lost far too many games.\n18 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:33:59\nHe's a renowned manager with massive experienceâ€¦ but just because he had one side who hovered in as much danger as we did, apparently we're too good for him.\nDoesn't matter that Klopp, Conte, Wenger, Howe et al all actually got relegated, it's noses up straight away to anyone who even flirted with it.\nIt's weird. It's negative. Hopefully it's only ToffeeWeb.\n19 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:34:59\nWouldn't be a bad call so long as he brought in a young coach along side him with a few new ideas as he's getting on a bit now.\nGot to be better than Dyche, Ferguson and a few other names being quoted.\n20 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:50:17\n21 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:53:07\nBlackburn Rovers didn't offer to Big Dunc but apparently he's ready for a premier league club. He hasn't managed a team properly. That is my concern, thumping chests makes no difference.\n22 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:54:21\n23 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:55:32\n24 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:56:15\nThere are a few players we have who I think would thrive under Bielsa, Gordon being one of them. He'd get them for and get them running hard, and even if we go down, we'd go down fighting.\nBut equally, he could totally fail to get across to the free-loading players we have, and with a lack of defensive organisation, could see us drop even further adrift.\nWhoever we go for is gonna be a gamble.\n25 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:57:01\n26 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:59:48\nAnd it needs to be someone who deal with limited players.\nWe saw an experienced international player just crumble.\nI'd prefer the Celtic or Kompany as manager, but I can't see us paying any compensation. So it looks Dyche or Bielsa.\n27 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:59:50\nSign him up sign him up Jesus Christ. Hope his interpreter is up to the task of managing the team.\n28 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:00:42\nLeeds were burnt out half-way through the season; if they hadn't sacked Biesla, they'd have been relegated.\n29 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:04:04\nI wonder how our succession planning process compares?\n30 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:09:20\n31 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:12:47\n32 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:24:19\nI like Don's idea of slippy G. Wrong on so many levels, I'm surprised he's not the bookies fave...\n33 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:26:41\n34 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:29:34\nThe main issue would be not having enough time to work his methods with the players, imo.\nHassenhutl is another manager who I think did a decent job with a poor team, is a manager with a specific method and gets teams passing well, but again, would probably need time.\nFact is, anyone who is on an upward trajectory in their Career is not gonna touch this job with a bargepole. So we can rule out Postecoglu, Kompany, or managers of Sporting or whoever. For these managers, we a merely a potential black stain on a CV.\n35 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:33:05\nMoise Kean and Dele Alli.\n36 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:34:45\nHe is a man of integrity and principle that fits the traditional Everton ethos but our board do not know the meaning of those words.\nSo sadly cannot see it.\n37 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:34:54\nNot because I dislike Bielsa or his style. But because if we seriously wanted to bring him in, we should have done it last summer or during the World Cup. Mainly because he needs time to get the players up to speed both tactically and fitness wise.\nWe need a coach to be able to come in and coax the side into getting points on the board immediately. Not someone who might take another dozen games to do it because he has a very specific \"philosophy\".\n38 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:39:05\nBut he'd play 2 up top?\nBielsa would be a terrifying prospect. I like watching his teams, and his idiosyncrasies are good value, but his style and our squad are a match made in hell. Remember when his Leeds team were shipping goals towards the end of his reign? What might the score be against Arsenal?\n39 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:40:16\n40 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:40:59\n41 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:52:41\nA manager that had Leeds finishing 9th in his first full season in the top flight.\nI'm born and bread in Leeds and almost everyone I speak to holds Bielsa in the highest regards. He should've been given the job after Moyes departed instead of the useless Martinez.\nI agree the timing could be better and should've been given the job before the World Cup after the double defeat to Bournemouth when it was clear Lampard was out of his depth.\nI think it's well worth the gamble though... having a world renowned coach who is an authoritarian and demands work-rate and fitness above all else.\n42 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:01:38\nIf Bielsa doesn't come I'll feel ashamed he thinks we're that shite\n43 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:02:02\nMeanwhile: other news; The Club have lined up a 𧹈M stadium finishing sponsorship for Oor Wully's bucket from a 'Mystery Uzbeki source...who is in no way connected to any other well known Uzbeki Billionaire'\n44 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:05:18\nI hate to say it but we should look at Dyche. He's our best chance of staying up I reckon. Give him an 18 month deal so we have a season of reasonable stability.before moving grounds. Just put a clause in the contract were he's not allowed to pick McNeil.\n45 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:06:53\nOne thing that Moshiri and Bielsa have in common for sure, is that their both as mad as a box of frogs. If he does get the job Bielsa's kamakasi defending will take us to another level of insanity, you ain't seen nothing yet !\n46 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:08:05\nI partly agree with you but will repeat my assertion that it's not him that would be the problem. It would be the timing and the players.\nI don't think we have looked particularly superior to any other side fitness and energy wise since Moyes. Barkley and Lukaku always seemed overweight under Martinez and Koeman while there has been this tendency to drop deep and not press and too much walking football elsewhere.\nBielsa plays a very specific way and most of our squad haven't played in that style ever or for a while.\nI'd fancy him to bring us back up yet getting him in seems like an acceptance we will go down. Go down fighting with some exciting performances yes. But Bielsa and what he gives you isn't for this scenario.\n47 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:12:00\nHow the fuck do you become an ex Everton fan ?\nWhat an absolute prick\n48 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:20:29\n49 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:25:12\nSimilar is happening to me. I used to be a football fan.\nI'm probably becoming an ex-football fan...\n50 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:25:13\n51 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:25:21\nThe same way Reidy became an ex Liverpool fan.\n52 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:31:30\nAnd didn't we also have the worst home record since we began under Martinez?\n53 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:31:38\nI don't think most people are ignorant about Bielsa. We've all enjoyed his style as neutrals, and getting Leeds back to the PL of course made him a hero there. But is that the style you want to see in a relegation fight? When Leeds sacked him, they were haemorrhaging goals and he refused to change. Or defend. Plus our players just aren't fit enough. Think it would be a huge gamble.\nI'm comfortable with bringing in Dyche and putting up with a well-organised, difficult to beat team who usually play unattractive football. Needs must. Plus none of us really know what he'd do with a slightly different club/squad to Burnley. See (also once relegated) Howe for details.\n54 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:35:30\nEverton have offered the managers job to a lifer in Walton nick\nHe said he would rather stay were he was.\n55 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:37:21\nExactly how many games did you see under Roberto Martinez?\nYes, he did well in the first season but the writing was on the wall towards the end of that campaign. I went to Fulham and Saints away. We dicked around against an extremely poor Fulham side who knew they were going down but were close to throwing away our lead.\nAt St Marys we scored two own goals and then Pochettino had RM on toast. They defended deep and we had absolutely nothing.\nIn his second season we did well in Europe before getting humiliated and in the league we were erratic and finished eleventh.\nThird and final season, we finished eleventh and got embarrassed many times including capitulation against the RS. Yes, we went to two semis and were unlucky in both regarding officiating. But there were reportedly arguments in the dressing room at half time against Man United as the players wanted to change the tactics and make a fist of it.\nAt that point, when Moyes had us in the top half for most of his tenure, finishing eleventh two seasons on the bounce when we had one of the best strikers in the league was just not good enough and Martinez had to go.\nI'd respect the point more if he had won something with some of the best players in Europe in three international tournaments. But he didn't.\n56 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:37:43\nMaybe we need that kind of ruthlessness to have a chance.\n57 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:38:20\n\" the Manager that ensured our highest finish (except 2004/05) since 1987.\"\nFalse. We finished 4th in 1988. Colin Harvey also got us to a few cup finals (FA and that fake one when we were banned from Europe). So let's bring him back.\n59 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:42:20\nHe'd last a week with our lot.\n60 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:45:44\nBielsa doesn't have everyone rushing forward and leaving the back door open. Leeds actually had one of the best defensive records in his 2 years in the Championship. He improves players and is great at developing youth. He achieved what he did at Leeds with a small budget and a limited standard of players.\nPep Guardiola and Pochettino are deciples of his.\nDyche would be a safe/pragmatic appointment I certainly wouldn't be against it. But, after years of watching slow ponderous, lethargic footy, I crave for someone like Bielsa.\nMaybe Big Dunc for the rest of this season to put a bit of fire in the belly of the players for the remainder of this season, then Bielsa to take charge next season... hopefully in the PL.\n61 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:47:34\nThis is a man that has said - “I do it because in football the most important element are the people who love the shirt, the club”\nPep Guardiola reckons he is a pretty good coach as well.\nLink\n62 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:47:55\nDo we honestly belive they have the foresight to look or speak to managers before sacking Frank ??\nOr are they scrambling round watching sky sports news to see who's top of the betting ?\nThey have there heads so far up their arses, that they probably have no contingency plans in place for if we do go down. That would only happen the day we got relegated. They need to plan for it now !!!\nThe whole house will come crashing down!\nLooking at the table, it's not an impossible task. I don't think another guy can do any worse. If its Dyche, Bielsa or some other out of work manager we can afford it is achievable!!\nSo it's one last throw of the nutty Iranians unlucky dice to save our league status...\n63 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:48:14\n64 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:54:03\nI think the issue is that we have been through every type of manager, young, old, fat, thin, curly hair, straight, foreign, British, long ball, passer, whisperer, shouter etc etc and have got progressively worse. So with our finances being the worst they've ever been, and the position in the table likewise, it's not rocket science for people to speculate that this might end badly for anyone on the supposed shortlist or indeed any one not on the shortlist. Ian and Dazza have been playing that games for years.\n65 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:56:30\nI don't give Moyes any credit for the 2009 final due to his cowardly tactics. The only Manager to settle for a 2-1 defeat in a Cup Final. As for his tactics at home against Villareal: The immobile Beattie up front on his own. Shocking.\n66 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:59:20\nNot sure our squad (or board!) are well set up for his approach and it's probably more likely to go the way of Marseille, Lazio or Lille than Leeds but who knows?\nA risky shot. But a fun one?\n67 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:01:07\nI for one am not denying that Bielsa is an excellent coach. If we were in the Championship and brought him in, I'd be excited. But I'm very scared about him trying to do a rescue job. His defensive record in the Championship feels less relevant than his most recent experiences in the PL. And the endorsements from Guardiola don't necessarily make him a good fit here in the loony bin. If he comes and rescues us, I'd be delighted if proven wrong. And it would be a hell of a ride.\n68 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:01:18\nI was thinking the same but someone mentioned him sitting on a comode and it's a horrible image I can't get out of my mind.\n69 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:04:54\nThe difference is, is that Martinez inherited a decent squad that was regularly challenging around the top 6. To his credit, he promoted Barkley and Stones to the first team. Barry, McCarthty and Lukaku were also brought in.\nIt initially worked as we had better players and we were still a fit well organised unit. But it became clear Martinez's methods were unsound as there was a clear decline in the fitness levels of the players and we started leaking goals for fun.\nThe football became slow and ponderous... it was possession without any purpose. He didn't think it was important to practice set pieces. He destroyed everything decent that Moyes had built - not that I was a massive fan of Moyes either.\n70 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:06:26\n1. Bielsa, mad + defensive issues\n2. Rooney, inexperienced\n3. Dyche, ginger goatee and silly voice\nAll will be on a hiding to nothing with this squad.\nOn the plus side, they may just generate enough oomph to get us out of trouble.\nStuart @67, perhaps the club are thinking Bielsa is the man for a promotion campaign - hence his appointment at this stage.\n71 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:10:38\nI was saying we've had every type of manager but have we ever had a bald one (I mean totally not comb overs) or one with a goatee? Something new to try I guess.\n72 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:16:02\nMy first thought was; If you are going to get pedantic and try to look clever, It helps if you know what youre talking about so you'll avoid making a a complete Cheshire cat of yourself.\nThe I looked at the poster who - in his own words. Has been doing it for years.\n73 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:18:35\nMartinez, maybe? I know he's bald now, but I also remember him not having much on top at the end of his time with us (unsurprisingly).\n74 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:20:25\n75 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:23:05\n77 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:23:58\nBielsa of 2014, at 58 years old, would have been great. The guy is now 67. He's a high energy man. The energy is diminished with age. He's not the same guy he was.\nSince Bilbao he has managed Marseille. It was the familiar Bielsa story, out of the traps and leading the league, only to run out of steam and fall short and he left. Ended in disappointment but the fans enjoyed the ride.\nNext on to lazio. He did his usual due diligence and demanded two particular signings to fix the problems he saw. He resigned in the pre-match press conference before a ball was kicked and said that the board had failed to sign the players and so had breached their agreement. He told the press so the fans knew why he walked away.\nThen we come to Lille. I may get it a little wrong here, but basically they were a CL team or thereabouts. Bielsa had them bottom. He was sacked and in came Galtier and he put them back where they should be and then won the league with pretty much the same team, making Bielsa look done.\nFor me, I saw the old Bielsa at Leeds. I think he did a good job.\nThere's been a lot more bad than good in the last 9 years. He's not the same Bielsa for me. The energy is fading. He can't do what he used to do.\nAlso, Bielsa doesn't take jobs without doing due diligence. This is watching every game for the last 3 years or more. Properly watching it, analysing it. Analysing every player. Then he analyses the opposition. Then he meets his employers and agrees a course of action and makes a list of demands.\nThis due diligence takes months. Either we've had this going on in background, or it's not happening, or it's just paper talk. If Bielsa hasn't done his normal due diligence then he's not the Bielsa of old.\nAs for defensive frailties, no that's a fallacy. Bielsa teaches his teams to defend from the front, high up the pitch, and it takes some getting used to. His teams can defend, it's just it looks bad when it's not working. As for Leeds, don't forget most of the players he was using were kids from the youth setup and it international superstars. Bielsa doesn't suffer fools and would bounce half of our squad out and use kids if they don't do what he demands.\nAnyway, love the guy, but it's too late for Bielsa at Everton.\n78 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:26:22\n79 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:27:33\n80 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:27:40\n1989 Fa cup and full member cup. Maybe that was before you supported Everton but that equals two under Colin. Wrong as usual aren't you buddy boy.\n81 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:28:03\n82 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:29:13\nIn Kinsella speak two is the new few.\nI havent laughed so much since he came on telling us he had a twenty year long affection for sheffield Wednesday and always looked out for their results because their forward once caught a ball while our Goalie was on the floor.\nNobody had the heart to tell him Paulo Di Canio was playing for West Ham at the time\n83 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:29:46\n84 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:31:42\n85 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:32:16\n86 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:33:33\nIt's called English. Definition few is a small number greater than one\n87 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:33:38\n88 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:35:08\nYou did indeed. I remember it\n89 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:35:20\nAnyway, like many, I'm just feeling beaten down by the whole situation, and emotionally checked out. A good appointment, coupled with Danjuma and another attacker or two, could save our season, but there's little reason to be optimistic at the moment.\n90 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:35:30\n91 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:36:16\nTheres one big problem though our players have had 20 games to prove they can score goals and we are still waiting.\nWe can hardly do worse than we have been and theres still an outside chance of surviving because theres 6 other teams almost as bad as we are.\nThat said though if we go down we are destined for a very troubled future.\n92 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:37:29\nEver since Silva left, I've only wanted Marcelo Gallardo. He's out of contract and waiting by the phone. We just need to offer him everything we can to convince him to give us a go. I'm sure he's itching to get back into coaching.\nStuart, Ryan told me to jump in.\n93 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:39:02\n94 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:42:58\n95 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:49:55\n96 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:53:38\nDyche is cleary the only option.\n97 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:55:43\nI am delighted to see you posting once again. For me you were an interesting poster and your opinions about a certain Silva have turned out to be rather wise.\nI wish you and your family well as I seem to recall you had a bereavement a few years back.\nYou have been missed by the way!\n98 Posted 23/01/2023 at 23:06:48\n99 Posted 23/01/2023 at 23:14:45\nI think the job will be on a temporary basis and will be reviewed after the next 18 games.\nI think Franck did a decent job at Brentford but we cannot be confident about anybody they bring in when there is no decent money to buy some class offensive players.\nIt's easy to lay all the blame at the manager (managers) who\nhave come and gone but there was obviously a disconnect between the board members and the managers.\nThere have been some very poor acquisitions and one wonders who is responsible for that over the last few years.\nObviously any manager who is out of work at the moment may jump at the chance if offered but with the Gunners and RS coming up he has little chance of turning the tide just yet.\n100 Posted 23/01/2023 at 23:16:08\n101 Posted 23/01/2023 at 23:18:38\nOnce we are safe (or down!) start changing things; after that, we can see if we have improved or not and go from there.\nThis is a big reality check for us as fans and as a club.\n102 Posted 23/01/2023 at 23:19:56\nI honestly don't know who I'd want as Everton manager. Many names out there but none of them really convince me.\nGallardo - great in South America but can he do it here?\nBielsa - Past his best?\nDyche - Six month contract and take it from there (if we stay up)?\nRooney - Sentimental choice but is he any better than Lampard?\nPostelogou(?) - Celtic manager sounds like a very interesting option but no one on our board can pronounce his name so he's out.\n103 Posted 23/01/2023 at 23:33:10\nHe stood up to the other two and reflects what most of us say and you pick that bit out.\n104 Posted 23/01/2023 at 23:42:59\nIf we do indeed go down and decide on a rebuild then Gallardo and a fresh approach could be the answer.Problem is, if Dyche comes he either saves us or is tasked with getting us out of the championship.\n105 Posted 23/01/2023 at 23:56:00\nIan Edwards, you have lost all credibility with me in your assessment of Martinez. Martinez inherited a very solid team from Moyes. He let them off the leash a bit more than Moyes and hence the initial success. After that, when it was truly his team, it all went downhill.\n106 Posted 23/01/2023 at 00:02:14\n107 Posted 23/01/2023 at 00:03:27\n108 Posted 24/01/2023 at 00:06:42\n109 Posted 24/01/2023 at 00:13:45\nAgreed but who at the club is an attacking wingback? Maybe young Mills, but who else?\nIt's frightening how much this squad lacks goals and creativity, I honestly don't know where that comes from except to throw two big lads up top and get balls into the box.\nThe full-backs don't score, the three midfielders don't score, and the wide men don't score, so best to get Calvert-Lewin and Simms into the box and pump the balls in. I'd also consider bringing back both Cannon and Nkounkou (the latter for his crossing ability).\n110 Posted 24/01/2023 at 00:19:40\nEver since then whenever a coaching vacancy became available at Everton as we all kniw, there have been numerous! I would have liked him to have gone for it.\nAs previously mentioned he is too principled and has too much integrity somethings our current board sadly lacks.\n111 Posted 24/01/2023 at 00:32:13\nI would start with Iwobi and McNeil wide, simply because they don't concede possession as much as Gordon and Gray. Gray can score wonder goals and make something out of nothing, but he also coughs the ball up often and easily. That makes life hard for the players around him who want to commit to go forward.\nI would play 3 5 2. I would have Onana, Garner and Davies in the middle and have them work their socks off. I know that it lacks some creativity but these three are not afraid to commit to get in the box, which we desperately need and they can also defend. The creativity can also come from the width.\nWe haven't tried a formation like this, its worth a shot with the players we have at our disposal. I I like Lampard, but he has been devoid of ideas.\n112 Posted 24/01/2023 at 00:39:10\nJob description - Name the length and salary of your desired contract, join us, never criticise the cancer ruining us, never succeed in improving the utterly lamentable quality of play, keep referring to our great history and then quietly fuck off as a millionaire nobody.\nI voted \"no confidence\" in the boardroom morons and Moshiri. Is that it though? Or are now going to increase the heat on all of them by repeating the ground-protest every single match?\nThere'll be a queue a mile long.\n113 Posted 24/01/2023 at 00:43:15\nSend in your football management CV to Everton and don't forget to include your UEFA coaching qualifications, who knows you might get an interview.\n114 Posted 24/01/2023 at 00:47:11\n115 Posted 24/01/2023 at 00:50:16\nI'm not sure I agree with your formation but I do agree with the 2 forwards.\nMcNeil and Iwobi at wingback would be asking a lot of any 3 center-halves with us, imo we would struggle.\nI certainly wouldn't completely dismiss your idea, but 4-4-2 would be my preference. Back to basics with two solid lines of 4 and 2 lads upfront who make it hard for defenders to walk around with the ball and pass out without any pressure.\n116 Posted 24/01/2023 at 00:57:11\n117 Posted 24/01/2023 at 00:57:50\n118 Posted 24/01/2023 at 01:08:09\nI recall you got some hammer on here for your admirable and unwavering support of Marco de Silva. I think I told you to let him go because he would let you down. There was nothing vindictive in it - it was just the way I felt at the time. He is certainly doing a good job at Fulham.\nBielsa seems a very driven character to me - I can't see age changing that in him. I also wouldn't be surprised if he could give us an assessment of any current premier league squad.\nSo I doubt very much he is too old and I don't think he is ready to hang his boots up just yet.\nHowever, from what I have read about him the owner will have to be scrupulously honest with him about transfer funds otherwise his track record suggest he will be off at the first sign of duplicity.\nRooney - definitely not for me - hasn't got the track record.\nDyche - doesn't fill me with enthusiasm.\nPearson has been suggested - in all honesty I am not quite sure why but I am willing to listen to an explanation.\nUp to now it's Bielsa for me but he would have us bemused at first I think because we appear to have the sort of players he seems to like working with but many of whom are not favourites on here. For example:-\nDavies, Holgate, Godfrey, Doucoure, Mykolenko, Patterson, Gueye.\n119 Posted 24/01/2023 at 01:17:30\nAs far as Everton are concerned I offer nothing but my unconditional support, love and hard earned cash.\nThe same as you probably...because other than that all you are offering is opinion.\nYour/my opinion on how we \"should\" play counts for fuck all, the new manager will do things their way.\nI'm not apologising for this statement but none of us have a fucking clue about managing a bunch of underperforming footballers, the fact you played under some UEFA coaches counts for nothing, I'm a nurse and have worked as a theatre nurse...that doesn't make me a brain surgeon.\n120 Posted 24/01/2023 at 02:23:26\nPatterson looks decent but Coleman is past his best. He and Bainsy gave us a great attacking option way back when but that is long gone.\nMykolenko crosses well but is haphazard.\nEverton have had some promising young fullbacks over the last few years but have overlooked them for some reason.\nRobinson now with Fulham is a better attacking option and has speed but Everton didn't want him.\nCoady hasn't brought stability to the back line and obviously Wolves don't want him back having now signed Dawson.\nEverton really miss a Jagielka kind of sweeper at the back to compensate for the mistakes being made by the players we have been sending out.\nI has said after last season that Everton needed to dump some dross during last Summer but they have held on to most of it and actually added to it hence the current position.\n121 Posted 24/01/2023 at 05:03:16\nMy opimion for what its worth\"\nDyche - A pub team manager with alehouse football.\nRooney - would usually be in the alehouse or a brothel and doesnt have the experience or intellect.\nBielsa - would certainly produce front foot football but are the players ready for him and could the board handle it.\nDunc - Would get us a few points in the first few games but doesnt have the tactical experience we need to survive.\nMarcel Gallardo - All day long but would he need time which we havent got to familiarise himself with the Prem\nSome off the wall:-\nDiego Martinez Penas - Villareal, voted the best up and coming manager in Spain now at Espanyol.\nJulien Stephan - Took Rennes to great heights and is now doing well at Strasbourg\nRÃºben Amorim _ Doing exceptionally well in Portugal and the Portugese do make good coaches but may be a bit young yet.\n122 Posted 24/01/2023 at 06:14:53\nIt feels strange to see the likes of Fulham, Brentford, Brighton doing so much better than us. We all know our recruitment has been lousy, but I would attribute a lot of it to bad luck -for example, injuries to Bolasie, Gbamin, Gomes, and the recurring issues with Delph, Mina, Godfrey, Calvert-Lewin plus of course, the expensive duds that many players turned out to be - Moise Kean, Allan, Bernard, James, etc.\nWe all know that we need stability in management, but none of the appointments that Moshiri has made have worked out for us, and you can't entirely blame him because he has always reacted to a bad run of results.\nWe need a huge change in fortune - in appointing a manager who can coach these players to perform better than they are now, is a good tactician, a strong character that gets the immediate respect of the players and can play a brand of football that gets the fans excited. My heart says Bielsa should be our next manager, but my head says someone safer like Dyche. My gut feeling is that the young core of the team can be coached to perform much better than they are right now and they could bloom under someone like Bielsa - Godfrey, Mykolenko, Holgate, Patterson, Davies, Garner, McNeill, Gordon, Onana, Iwobi, Gray, Simms, Calvert-Lewin, Vinagre, Maupay., even Danjuma if he joins us.\nWould it help if we the fans kind of accept that this is a period of rebuilding with a strong possibility that we go down this year, but we will come back stronger? I am definitely not advocating that we accept relegation, but maybe if we understand what the manager is trying to do with the players, then the players don't play under pressure with the headless chicken desperation that usually results in a bad outcome. Just a thought.\n124 Posted 24/01/2023 at 06:43:32\nI thought this decision was going to be left to the Director of Football?\nI was always led to learn from lessons and previous mistakes.\nTake note Mr Moshiri.\nI know it's your investment, but leave it to people who know what they're doing.\nAnd yes, I know he won't be reading this, so I don't know why I'm talking to him!!\n125 Posted 24/01/2023 at 06:44:47\nClearly not a brain surgeon, coming on a football forum/ website to moan about fans offering opinion about. football.\n126 Posted 24/01/2023 at 06:45:29\n127 Posted 24/01/2023 at 06:46:24\n128 Posted 24/01/2023 at 06:57:27\n129 Posted 24/01/2023 at 07:12:23\n130 Posted 24/01/2023 at 07:42:42\n131 Posted 24/01/2023 at 07:58:12\n132 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:08:09\nhttps://twitter.com/grandoldteam/status/1617629837975511040?s=46&t=b-MfCS79yIgebTgm9HQ83A\n133 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:18:45\nBielsa played gung ho football which included the likes of Raphina and Rodrigo, forward players in that side which are a huge improvement on what we have yet still couldn't win matches. What chance does he have on winning games 3-2/4-3 with the likes of DCL/Gray and Gordon. None.\n134 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:26:11\nHe emphasis fitness and a few of ours may be blowing for tugs, coming out of the tunnel. :-)\n135 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:30:10\nLots and lots of Leeds fans are saying the same on Twitter, he is very highly reguarded and would be perfect fit for Everton FC\n136 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:36:33\n137 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:40:28\nHas Everton got a plan A let alone Plan B?\n138 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:47:28\nImo it's time for Dyche!! Give him short term deal with options for longer. If by some miracle we stay up then next year won't be too different.\nPickford will go.\nGordon will go.\nDcl if anyone would pay.\nRooney, big dunk do one !!! Fat Sam on radio saying how bad recruitment has been !!! And should of spent better. He's part of it !!! Blew millions !!\nGet Dyche and try and kick f@ck out of every team till end of the season.\n139 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:47:35\n140 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:49:42\n141 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:51:44\n142 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:52:22\nPeople like Steven Schumacher should already be in their sights. Are they even monitoring the likes of him ?\nSteve was born in Liverpool, knows the club. Everton youth, England U19's. He's doing an amazing job at Plymouth. Personally I would be seriously considering him now but I expect the club haven't even looked in his direction. Their radar hasn't even bleeped where he is concerned.\nI'm not saying the next manager has to be an Evertonian, far from it but I was talking to a Pilgrim pal who is ex Navy and he said he's doing a great job at their club\n143 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:55:18\n144 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:58:21\n145 Posted 24/01/2023 at 09:05:25\nWe don't appear to have many good options which is only right given the joke of a club that we have been turned into. I very much doubt if the owner actually knows what he should be looking for. None of the previous managers had the same method of playing as the previous one and we are now left with an unmitigated disaster.\nMy only hope was that the DOF would make the call, however, it looks as if that was just wishful thinking. If the DOF is being sidelined in the selection process then he should resign!\nThe protests at the running of the club must continue!\nSad times\n146 Posted 24/01/2023 at 09:11:33\nChristopher, isn't that the case with all managers?\n147 Posted 24/01/2023 at 09:14:29\nWe are doomed with this lot in charge.\n148 Posted 24/01/2023 at 09:24:48\nAll we can hope is that we appoint someone who can keep us in the Premier League until new owners come in and those new owners remove Billy the Liar and all who stayed loyal to him.\n149 Posted 24/01/2023 at 09:25:27\nWRONG- WRONG - WRONG>\n150 Posted 24/01/2023 at 09:33:20\nIf we do get Biesla - I hope it's an 18 month contract and we line someone like Schumacher up to replace him. At the very least he'd get players working and weed out the players who are not interested in working for the team - might be a good foundation for the next manager.\n151 Posted 24/01/2023 at 09:44:09\n152 Posted 24/01/2023 at 09:46:47\nanyone else. I did think though that Dyche in particular would have been a good fit then, with the\nability to do the short term firefighting which was required, and then move on to something\nmore expansive.\nHis reputation has dimmed a little after his departure from Burnley but he still ticks a lot of boxes.\nApart from his coaching skills he has always spoken sensibly after games, seems a good guy and is\nwell turned out, all important attributes for an Everton manager.\nIf we do turn to Dyche I would want him to emphasise that the supporters will have to embrace survival football for the rest of the season, but that his ambition is to then progress to the style of\nfootball which Everton were famous.\n153 Posted 24/01/2023 at 09:49:30\nOur obsession with history holds us back, on so many levels. Some supporters were living in hope that we could limp to BMD and finally modernise the old dinosaur that is Everton FC but now we don't see that happening anymore. I can even see Everton playing in a new ground but still playing all the same ancient songs, and getting the supporters to sing along like it's all cosy & traditional. What a pile of nonsense.\nWe will go down in my view, regardless of who the manager is - when you look at it, we need to win 7 or 8 of our remaining games and we've so far won 3. It just isn't at all likely if we're honest with ourselves.\nBielsa would be a trainwreck - one of our biggest issues, aside from having players who are basically footballing strangers, is that we keep employing managers trying to play football that is beyond the ability of the footballers employed to play it. Bielsa would struggle with this lot because his brand of football is fast, intelligent, crisp passing, movement, intensity and forward thinking. None of those things apply to our players so why on earth does anyone think it would be a good idea is beyond me.\nI never wanted Lampard but warmed to him as a person over time, and I felt we stayed up out of pure luck more than anything to do with his shrewd judgement last year - his chickens have certainly come home to roost this year and I for one am not surprised one bit - it was all so predictable.\nSean Dyche is not my favourite manager, although I quite enjoy his interviews so that's a small crumb of comfort and about all we have to look forward to following this shambles of a football club. We're screwed basically, and won't have a huge amount of options (who would want the job now?!?). I'd be surprised if Dyche was even interested to be honest and who could blame him?\nMoshiri speaking to Bielsa doesn't really mean shit - I've spoken to my girlfriend about the managerial situation at Everton, it doesn't mean she's up for taking over.\n154 Posted 24/01/2023 at 10:02:14\nHis idea of having a team physically ready for action on day 1 is up a notch on what other managers expectations. When he took the Leeds job it was before pre season.\nHis last year at Leeds was not a good one, they were in the bottom half from early part of the season. He had major injuries at the back and was without his main man in mid field and up top.\nHis age is against him and his style of play bears no relation to that of our past two managers, his teams play on the front foot.\nI have advocated that the DOF should select the next manager but to be honest I don't know what style of play he prefers.\n155 Posted 24/01/2023 at 10:04:21\nIF ! and it's a very, very big If, there might be Qarari investment then they would look to be putting Cahill in as CEO or even Chairman.\n156 Posted 24/01/2023 at 10:08:13\n157 Posted 24/01/2023 at 10:27:28\nCouldn't give a toss if some of our players couldn't handle the extra effort they would need to put in. Hang the bastards out to dry, don't relate to any of them. Not fit to wear the royal blue never more apt for the spineless fookers.\nIf we go down at least it will be fighting for the cause.\n158 Posted 24/01/2023 at 10:44:39\n159 Posted 24/01/2023 at 10:50:05\nWhilst it would be an interesting appointment, I sadly have to agree with the phoenix from the flames that is Steve Ferns @ 77.\nA couple of quotes on Bielsa from the book:\n“doomed always to follow the same paradigm, spreading first bewilderment, then enlightenment and finally exhaustionâ€\n“Football played with bielista intensity is fine for those who are technically gifted but when lesser players look to play at that pace, the result is a mess of poor first touches and misplaced passes, too many balls thumped aimlessly forwardâ€\nBut I can't say I'm too excited about the prospect of Dyche either.\nAnd thanks Pat Kelly @ 20 for cheering me up – very funny, “bucket listâ€ indeed!\n160 Posted 24/01/2023 at 10:50:29\n161 Posted 24/01/2023 at 11:00:40\n162 Posted 24/01/2023 at 11:04:19\n163 Posted 24/01/2023 at 11:05:24\n164 Posted 24/01/2023 at 11:08:25\n165 Posted 24/01/2023 at 11:12:11\nWe're going two ways here. Someone we've never heard of. Up and coming from the lower leagues or the continent.\nOr the obvious British candidates.\nThe challenge we have is who would anyone credible want to touch this? I can feel a Howard Kendall Mark 3 coming on.\nBasically, we will have to take what we can get because no one else wants it.\nWhoever it is, we just need the team focussed on the next match.\n166 Posted 24/01/2023 at 11:15:51\n167 Posted 24/01/2023 at 11:28:44\n168 Posted 24/01/2023 at 11:47:13\n169 Posted 24/01/2023 at 11:51:44\n170 Posted 24/01/2023 at 11:52:40\n171 Posted 24/01/2023 at 11:57:17\nWe have to change the dynamic, its no use getting another manager who will play possession football, play out from the back malarkey because our darlings cant do it.\nApart from Big Sam who did what he was hired to do by the way, our recent managers have all been tarred with the same brush.\nWe need an emergency manager not some fancy dan, Dyche stands out a mile to me.\nGive him a well paid short contract and a couple of players he wants if possible.\nI think its our best shot.\n172 Posted 24/01/2023 at 11:57:41\nLet me be first to say Welcome to Everton Marcelo\n173 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:00:49\n174 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:02:29\n175 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:08:19\nAnd didn't Kenwright have a hard on for Mark Hughes when Moyes left?\n176 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:11:16\n177 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:12:58\n178 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:16:14\nMakes me laugh how Twitter goes viral a few retweets and we have fans going mad.\n179 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:18:24\n180 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:19:49\n181 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:20:57\nWe need someone of that ilk again (but not him).\n182 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:22:28\nI realise that would be optimistic and knowing Moshiri and Kenwright this will drag on for another month, which will put us in even more jeopardy if that's possible.\n183 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:24:56\n184 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:35:42\nWould sooner play 'lovely football' and get beat every week, well count me out.\n185 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:37:09\n186 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:37:52\nBielsa may give that new manager bounce that gets the wins needed to get away from the bottom.\nHe would get me excited again (sad I know) whereas Dyche and his ilk would just prolong the apathy that has become EFC.\n187 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:50:08\n188 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:51:45\n189 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:52:19\nI think you have summed it up nicely about the guy, he would have been a very good choice after Moyes but hardly now.\nIt's totally depressing how bad things now are, this is the worst time that I can remember in my life time following the club.\n190 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:54:19\n191 Posted 24/01/2023 at 13:09:50\nThe fact every single source saying he is not keen stems from a single Daily Mail article is all you need to focus on\n192 Posted 24/01/2023 at 13:51:42\n193 Posted 24/01/2023 at 13:56:44\nNothing would surprise me with the current state of the club, shouldn't Talksport give Everton some sponsorship money, after all, the last few years have provided plenty of subject matter for them to discuss.

All the current squad would depart (pretty much) and Bielsa would be working with an entirely new squad (including more Academy graduates) with parachute money that would be compliant to his high energy tactics.\nI appreciate that he is getting on a bit, but 67 is not that old, and if he is mentally up for the challenge, then fine.\nHe doesn't come across as someone who would take the gig just as a retirement fund boost. He seems to have a really professional ethic.\nSo, on balance I guess I am game. Just keep him for at least a few years!\n199 Posted 24/01/2023 at 14:23:42\nWe've lacked fitness, movement and excitement for ages. It may take a while to implement his style, but at least he has an identifiable style! If it's not materialising on the pitch, it's coz the players are pish.\nI'm not bothered about the language. We just had an Englishman and we were shit.\nWhen I go to Goodison, spending a small fortune, I want entertainment, not serious boredom.\nBrighton would of been good to watch, if it wasn't against us! I want to be entertained, but I'm resigned to relegation this season.

Everton are currently left bewildered with medical, media and agreements all complete\n204 Posted 24/01/2023 at 14:45:39\n205 Posted 24/01/2023 at 15:06:29\n206 Posted 24/01/2023 at 15:10:28\n207 Posted 24/01/2023 at 15:16:13\n208 Posted 24/01/2023 at 15:20:22\n209 Posted 24/01/2023 at 15:23:34\nHe had the effrontery to comment on the money wasted on transfers.\nAfter his track record.\n210 Posted 24/01/2023 at 16:30:59\nMan, we all KNEW our club was being badly run, but nobody expected it to be this badly run. We are in a world of shit, and anyone thinking we can cherry pick a manager and attract players we need in the next week is deluded.\nFans groups need to get to goodison tomorrow night. Lap of chants and pitch forms needed. What a mess.\n211 Posted 24/01/2023 at 16:49:01\nYou'd need someone accustomed to hellish working conditions and being surrounded by innumerable\ntortured souls.\nHe wouldn't be sat on his bucket at Goodison, within weeks he'd be voluntarily kicking the bloody bucket just to get out.\n212 Posted 24/01/2023 at 17:17:04\nFfs please no\n213 Posted 24/01/2023 at 17:28:01\nDamjuma gone. Gordon Going. Onana missing. Bielsa running for the hills. Talk of Allardyce and God forbid Hassenhuttl.\nWhy don't we just turn the lights out and hand the keys to the Premier League\n214 Posted 24/01/2023 at 17:30:18\n215 Posted 24/01/2023 at 17:36:06\n216 Posted 24/01/2023 at 17:38:17\n217 Posted 24/01/2023 at 17:42:10\n218 Posted 24/01/2023 at 17:49:07\nSaturday night\" it's a bad time\"\nNo shit Sherlock !!\nResign, you useless, ignorant fool of a man\n219 Posted 24/01/2023 at 18:31:36\nPremier league experience, tighten the defence, already have the DoF and ex- players etc.\nI'll through in Massimo Carrera who has a good record but no Premier league experience.\n220 Posted 24/01/2023 at 18:33:38\n221 Posted 24/01/2023 at 18:38:34\n222 Posted 24/01/2023 at 18:47:12\n223 Posted 24/01/2023 at 18:47:45\n224 Posted 24/01/2023 at 18:52:32\nGet him on a rolling 6 months contract till June 2023, then decide what to do next.\nIts the only option.\n225 Posted 24/01/2023 at 18:57:27\n226 Posted 24/01/2023 at 18:57:42\nWorried bielsa is divisive & rubs people up wrong way.\nSo we will end up running to Rooney or dunk last day of transfer window saying we can get 25m for Gordon!!!\nIn the world cup break surely there was scope to find a better replacement?\nMore time to work with players?\nAsses the squad before this window?\nWe have missed the opportunity to get a decent long term replacement. It's dogs of war needed.\nNow we are like the last bounties at the bottom of a celebration tub ! No one wants to touch us except some meffy old geezers who no one offered any of the good sweets to.\n227 Posted 24/01/2023 at 19:21:17\n228 Posted 24/01/2023 at 19:28:51\n229 Posted 24/01/2023 at 19:43:17\n230 Posted 24/01/2023 at 20:01:44\n231 Posted 24/01/2023 at 20:03:08\n232 Posted 24/01/2023 at 20:03:39\nDid you want Sam Allardyce too? Never trust a man eating a Bounty...\n233 Posted 24/01/2023 at 20:40:51\n234 Posted 24/01/2023 at 21:18:58\n“They report Bielsa has run the rule over the current Toffees squad and determined they lack pace, particularly in defensive areas.â€\n“Without quick players who can effectively close down their opposite number and therefore make Bielsa's man-to-man system a success, the 67-year-old fears his tenure on Merseyside would be doomed to fail.\nAs such, Bielsa has reportedly told Everton to prioritise signing pacey players in the final week of the window.â€\nAt this critical point in time Bielsa could be the person with the force of personality and radical approach to save the club.\nThere's talk of a million a month to hire him, so give him it every month until June , that's just over ٢m. Then talk again.\nHe needs to get in tomorrow and get those players signed. Maybe that's why we are having the sales now to be able to give Biesla some financial ammunition to get his own targets in.\nI am clutching at straws hoping that our board have formulated some sort of plan.\n235 Posted 24/01/2023 at 21:45:54\n236 Posted 24/01/2023 at 21:52:01\n237 Posted 24/01/2023 at 22:25:48\n238 Posted 25/01/2023 at 07:35:51\nEveryone saying this squad isn't equipped for his style, are they equipped for anything? I honestly can't see them grinding out enough points defending their way through it.\nThe only way might be to go all out for wins. We need 7 wins and a couple of draws. I'm sure we'd get spanked in a few games but the craziness of it all might be enough to win a few too.\nIt's probably too late but they have to try something as at the moment, I can't even see them getting to 25 points.\n239 Posted 25/01/2023 at 10:04:59\nAt 67, surely he's retired or about to.\nSacked from his last job BUT now saying he needs £12 million per season ti come to us BUT btw your squad is too slow for me at the moment.\nSurely the headline in the papers and on Sky news is Bielsa prices and talks himself out of a job at Everton\nWe move on\n240 Posted 25/01/2023 at 10:13:15\nThen he came to the same conclusion as everyone, they're crap.\nChampionship here we come.\n241 Posted 25/01/2023 at 13:02:49\nI'm an admirer of his but I don't think he's ever been that successful and his refusal to change isn't something I could agree would be good for Everton.\nFlogging a dead horse sums it up.\n242 Posted 26/01/2023 at 09:09:50\n243 Posted 26/01/2023 at 09:47:47\nWonder if Lord Lucan is still available?\n244 Posted 26/01/2023 at 10:18:21\nBarrett-Baxendale is a complete embarrassment and we're a total laughing stock. These managers should be interviewing Everton â€“ not the other way round.\n245 Posted 26/01/2023 at 10:22:10\nWhen Bielsa took over at Leeds he lived in a 1 bedroom flat in Wetherby which was close to Leeds training ground. There is also the story of when he was managing Newalls Old Boys, some fans were not happy with the way the team was playing and went to his house to protest. But Bielsa came out with a hand grenade and threatened to pull the pin if they didnt leave, I think the protest ended pretty quickly.\nAlso I read in Pochettinos autobiography that when he was a young player he was invited to go for a trial for Newalls Old Boys when Bielsa was manager. But Pochettino had a long journey to get to the trial so he told his father he was to tired and he never went. After the trial finished Bielsa asked local coach Villa Canas was there anybody he hadnt seen. Canas said the best young player never turned up and the rumour was he was about to sign for Central, Newalls Old Boys biggest rival. But Pochettinos father told him what happened apparently Bielsa and his assistant Jorge Griffa went to Pochettinos house. But it was 1.00 am when they got there and Pochettinos father let them in, after a coffee Bielsa asked could he see me so his father took them into the bedroom were Pochettino was fast asleep. Griffa Bielsas assistant asked if they could remove the bedclothes so they could see his legs. Both agreed he looked like a footballer and left. Pochettino duly signed for Newalls Old Boys.\nSo Bielsa is certainly a very unusual guy who does things completely different from most coaches. But maybe the years have mellowed Bielsa.\n246 Posted 26/01/2023 at 10:31:26\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
