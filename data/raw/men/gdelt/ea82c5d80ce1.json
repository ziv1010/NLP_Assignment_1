  "body_text": "FOOTBALL – MANCHESTER City’s Erling Haaland and Rayan Cherki struck before halftime to secure a Champions League a place in the last 16 for their side in a 2-0 victory over Galatasaray last night.\nPep Guardiola’s side claimed eighth spot in the eight-game league phase to avoid the two-legged playoffs and advance directly to the last-16 for a precious slice of breathing room in an already-packed fixture schedule.\nHaaland headed an early chance wide but made up for it in the 11th minute when Jeremy Doku delivered a perfect ball to put Haaland one-on-one with Ugurcan Cakir. The Norwegian chipped the ball over the keeper for his first open-play goal in 10 games.\nDoku also provided the assist for Cherki’s goal when he drew two defenders before laying the ball back for the Frenchman, who took a touch before slotting it home in the 29th minute.\nHolders Paris St Germain and Real Madrid both failed to seal automatic spots in the knockout round as they slipped out of the top eight on a frenetic final night of group-stage action across Europe.\nPSG could only draw 1-1 at home to Newcastle United -- a result that left both sides facing a playoff despite starting the final night in the automatic places.\nFifteen-time winners Real Madrid were beaten 4-2 at Jose Mourinho’s Benfica, meaning they fell from third to ninth.\nLiverpool thrashed Qarabag 6-0 to end their group campaign in style and finish in third place.\nBarcelona, who began the evening in ninth spot, spared themselves a playoff tie as they came from a goal down to beat Copenhagen 4-1 and finish fifth, one place behind Tottenham Hotspur who won 2-0 at Eintracht Frankfurt.\nChelsea came from behind to win 3-2 at Napoli with Joao Pedro’s double helping them clinch sixth spot. Defeat left Napoli down and out in 30th place.\nPortugal’s Sporting grabbed a last-gasp 3-2 win at Athletic Bilbao thanks to a goal by Alisson Santos to snatch a top-eight spot and effectively relegate Real Madrid to the playoffs.\nArsenal, who like Bayern Munich were already assured of a top-eight finish, became the first club in the new 36-team group format to finish with a 100 per cent record, beating bottom club Kairat Almaty 3-2. Bayern finished second after a 2-1 victory at PSV Eindhoven that left the Dutch club eliminated.",
