I'm proud of my players because they kept on pushing and pushing.\"\nUlsan also advanced to the quarter-finals and will play fellow South Koreans Jeonbuk after beating Japanese second-division outfit Ventforet Kofu 2-1 for a 5-1 aggregate win.\nKim Ji-hyun scored early in the first half and Joo Min-kyu added another goal in the final minute at Tokyo's National Stadium.\nKazushi Mitsuhira scored a late consolation for Ventforet, who were appearing in the Champions League for the first time after winning Japan's domestic cup.\nThe result leaves Yokohama as the only Japanese side left in the competition.\nJapan's defending champions Urawa Red Diamonds were eliminated at the group stage.\nKewell said he \"saw a lot of positive signs\" in his first two games as Yokohama coach.\n\"There are still areas that we need to work on but I can't fault my players with the work ethic that they've shown from day one,\" he said.\n\"They've taken it with a smile on their face.\"\n© 2024 AFP",
