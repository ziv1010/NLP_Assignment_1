As happens every year, the broadcaster has released the salaries of its highest-paid stars in its yearly report.\nFormer Match of the Day host Gary Lineker, who recently departed from the corporation, once again topped the list with a salary of £1.35 million.\nHe was followed by Radio 2 personality Zoe Ball, who earned £515,000 despite being replaced on the station's Breakfast Show by Scott Mills after hosting her final show at the end of last year.\nMeanwhile, ex-footballer and Match Of The Day pundit Alan Shearer was the third-highest earner, reports the Manchester Evening News. The former Newcastle United forward will continue to provide football analysis on the BBC in the upcoming season alongside incoming Match Of The Day presenters Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan.\nHis income also included his contributions to the BBC's coverage of European football tournaments, such as the UEFA Champions League highlights shows.\nBBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show host Greg James secured the fourth spot on the list, with earnings between £425,000 and £429,999. His income also includes his work on the Radio 4 show Rewinder.\nFiona Bruce and Nick Robinson tied for the fifth-highest earners. Radio 2 presenter Vernon Kay made it into the top 10 for the first time, earning £390,000, a significant increase from his previous £320,000.\nBBC Breakfast's Naga Munchetty also saw an increase in her salary, placing her in the top ten with £355,000, up from £345,000. However, her co-host Charlie Stayt's salary remained unchanged.\nThe top 10 earners this year are:\n- Gary Lineker - £1.35million\n- Zoe Ball - £515,000 - cut from £950,000\n- Alan Shearer - £440,000 - up from £380,000\n- Greg James - £425,000 - up from £415,000\n- Fiona Bruce - £410,000 - up from £405,000 and Nick Robinson - £410,000 - up from £345,000\n- Stephen Nolan - £405,000\n- Laura Kuenssberg - £395,000 - up from £325,000\n- Vernon Kay - £390,000 - up from £320,000\n- Justin Webb - £365,000 - up from £320,000\n- Naga Munchetty - £355,000 - up from £345,000\nA number of the BBC's on-screen talent doesn't feature in the publicly-funded BBC’s salary dossier, which discloses salaries above £178,000, because they are paid by external production firms or BBC Studios, the corporation’s commercial arm.\nMany big names, including Strictly Come Dancing hosts Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly, Graham Norton and Bradley Walsh do not feature for the same reason.",
