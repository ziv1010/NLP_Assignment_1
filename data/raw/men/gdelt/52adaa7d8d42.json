It is three years ago that Newcastle United paid £63m for Alexander Isak, so no reason why they wouldn’t pay £60m+ now if Eddie Howe thinks he is the right player.\nInterestingly, Joao Pedro almost helped wreck Eddie Howe’s Newcastle United project before it properly got going. At the age of 20 he came to St James’ Park in January 2022 and scored a Watford equaliser (see image above) with two minutes to go. Making it only one win in 20 PL matches for Newcastle United. However, Eddie Howe then produced a run of six wins and a draw in the next seven PL games and the rest is, as they say, history.\nAt the age of 23, Joao Pedro very much fits the profile of a typical Eddie Howe NUFC signing and having now won a trophy and able to offer Champions League football, interesting to see if Eddie Howe can finally now add Joao Pedro to his Newcastle United squad.\nThe Telegraph – Mike McGrath reporting 7 June 2025:\n‘Newcastle United are ready to step up their pursuit of Joao Pedro after identifying the Brighton and Hove Albion forward as the ideal profile to bolster Eddie Howe’s attack.\nAs revealed by Telegraph Sport, Howe initially targeted Bryan Mbeumo this summer but the Brentford forward is heading towards Manchester United in a deal worth more than £60 million.\nNewcastle have now turned to Pedro, who is rated just as highly at St James’ Park, and Howe has been tracking the 23-year-old’s progress since he moved from Fluminense to Watford in 2020 as a teenager.\nHis technical ability, pace and strength has seen him targeted as a player considered at Newcastle previously.\nThe Newcastle manager has been looking to add a wide forward who can cut inside with Pedro seen as the ideal candidate to support Alexander Isak as centre-forward while also being able to play through the middle himself.\nBrighton are expected to want upwards of £60 million for the forward who they landed from Watford in a club-record £30 million deal two seasons ago.’\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
