He had settled into the team and was named the club’s Player of the Month in November 2021 following several standout performances. His injury, however, has blighted his career since.\nNot only did he miss out on representing his country at the 2021 African Cup of Nations, but he also struggled to force his way into the Villa line-up under new boss Unai Emery. The Spaniard, who was brought in to replace Steven Gerrard who was sacked in October, turned results around to such a degree that bookmakers at bettors.co.za will be considering the Midlanders as a good shout for a Champions League spot next season.\nHowever, a January 2023 move to Championship side Luton Town may have been the kickstart Nakamaba’s career needed. The Zimbabwean has shone in the Luton side since moving south to Bedfordshire and was instrumental in The Hatters’ play-off semi-final second-leg win against Sunderland, as reported on bbc.co.uk.\nThe 29-year-old began his football career aged 16 with local club Bantu Rovers, before moving to France’s Nancy in December 2012. Nakamba made just two appearances for the first team before transferring to Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem, where he was a team member that won the KNVB Beker (the equivalent of the FA Cup) in 2017. This remains the club’s only significant honour.\nFollowing this success, Nakamba moved to Club Brugge in Belgium where he made 53 appearances in two years before his move to the Premier League with Aston Villa. Away from the pitch, in 2020, he launched his own community project to support disadvantaged children in Zimbabwe through education, sport and community projects – the mnakambafoundation.org.\nAfter initially being postponed due to Covid-19, the foundation held an invitational football tournament for under-17s in June 2022. His charity work has been recognised by major figures such as Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa and HRH The Prince of Wales who – as the interview below shows, is an Aston Villa fan.\nIn 2019, Nakamba’s hometown of Hwange announced a statue would be erected in his honour to mark his Premier League. Nakamba is one of only four Zimbabwean footballers to have played in England’s premier competition – the others being Jordan Zemura, Benjani and Peter Ndlovu.\nSo, what does the future hold for Marvelous Nakamba, and where does he go next?\nAfter the season Aston Villa has had, he may struggle to get back into the side – particularly bearing in mind his age and the quality of midfielders the club is being linked with. However, his performances for Luton over the second half of the season must surely have demonstrated that he’s fully recovered from his injury – and that he deserves to be playing at the highest level. Whether that means playing for a Premier League club or moving to one of the other major European leagues remains to be seen. But there can be no doubt that there’s more to come yet from this talen",
