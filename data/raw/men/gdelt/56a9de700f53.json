  "body_text": "The story of Newcastle United in Europe - ahead of the club's 18th continental campaign\nNewcastle United have played 140 games in Europe, beating some of the continent’s biggest teams along the way\nNewcastle United fans will be digging out their passports this summer in anticipation of the welcome return next season of European football. Despite the fleeting anticlimax of that last-day home defeat to Everton, United did enough over the course of the 38-game Premier League season to finish in fifth place with the money-spinning prize being a place in the 2025-26 Champions League.\nAdded to the club winning its first domestic silverware in 70 years, in the shape of the Carabao Cup, it marked the conclusion to the most successful campaign at St James’ Park in living memory.\nAll eyes will be on the Champions League draw which takes place on August 28, with the first games kicking off on September 16, 17 and 18. The competition’s updated format means United will play eight games - four at home and four away against different opponents - in the league phase, before hopefully progressing to the knock-out stage.\nA glance at the four probable pots of 36 teams involved in the competition offers the promise of some real glamour ties under the midweek lights at St James’ and on foreign fields. The heavyweights of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Paris St Germain are all possible opponents from pot one. And from the other three likely pots, the likes of Atletico Madrid, Juventus, Benfica, Sporting Lisbon, Ajax and Celtic (should they get through the play-offs) would all provide mouthwatering opposition. For all the ups and downs in Newcastle United’s history, the club’s European record is none too shabby.\nNext season, the Toon faithful will watch the Magpies’ fourth Champions League adventure and their 18th continental campaign overall. To date, United have played 140 competitive games in Europe, winning 75, drawing 31 and losing 34.\nThey have competed in the Champions League, UEFA Cup, Europa League, Cup Winners Cup, Intertoto Cup and Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. And there have been some famous scalps along the way.\nThe 1968-69 season saw United’s inaugural European campaign. Incredibly, and against all the odds, Bobby Moncur, Wyn Davies, Pop Robson and co lifted the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup at the first time of asking, beating Ujpest Dozsa of Hungary over two legs in the final.\nIn the same competition, the following season saw them fall in the quarter-finals to Anderlecht of Belgium. Then in 1970-71, more than 56,000 fans at St James’ Park witnessed United beat Italian champions Inter Milan before bowing out in the next round.\nThe black and whites were back in Europe in 1978, but their UEFA Cup involvement was short-lived this time around, and they exited in the second round to Bastia of France whose star man, Dutch international Johnny Repp, memorably scored a wonder goal at St James’ Park.\nThere was a long, long wait for the club’s next European campaign, but in 1994-95 Kevin Keegan’s ‘Entertainers’ returned, hammering Royal Antwerp of Belgium over two legs, before snatching defeat from the jaws of victory and going out to Athletic Bilbao.\nThe late 1990s and early 2000s saw Newcastle competing in Europe on a regular basis. Barcelona (in 1997-98) and Juventus (2002-03) were famously put to the sword in the Champions League. In 2003-04, meanwhile, Bobby Robson’s highly capable United side did well to reach the semi-final of the UEFA Cup where they were undone by Marseille and their powerful centre-forward Didier Drogba.\nWith the club consistently toiling during the often bleak Mike Ashey era, 2012-13 marked the sole European qualification during that period. Alan Pardew’s team would earn credit where it was due, however, progressing to the quarter-finals of the Europa League where they were beaten by Benfica.\nAfter years of mediocrity, United’s resurgence in the early 2020s saw Eddie Howe and his team earn a brilliant fourth place Premier League finish and qualification for the 2023-24 Champions League. A draw against AC Milan at the intimidating San Siro was creditable enough, but the highlight of the campaign was the thrilling 4-1 destruction of Paris St Germain, featuring Kylian Mbappe, at St James’ Park.\nOnly a highly controversial late penalty decision in the away leg at the Parc des Princes robbed United of victory and prevented them progressing to the next stage.\nSo, what will Newcastle United’s 2025-26 Champions League adventure bring? Real Madrid or Bayern Munich for the first time in the competition - or maybe Barcelona for the third time? We await the draw in August.\nWe have a dedicated newsletter for ChronicleLive’s nostalgia stories and pictures. It’s free and you can sign up to receive it here.
