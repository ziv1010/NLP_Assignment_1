Manchester City had won the title for the second time in their history, Liverpool qualified for the Inter Cities from a third place finish, which meant Everton in fifth couldn’t qualify, Leeds in fourth place qualified along with sixth place Chelsea, Spurs were seventh and didn’t qualify because of Chelsea, West Brom qualified from eighth, Arsenal who were ninth missed out because of Chelsea, which gave The Toon the last Inter Cities place because of the tenth place finish.\nThe 1969 Fairs Cup triumph is etched in Geordie History, the two leg ties with Feyenoord, Sporting, Zaragoza, Vitoria Setubal and Glasgow Rangers, saw us being swept along by our magnificent supporters to the two leg final against Ujpest Dozsa.\nAfter winning the Fairs Cup, the Geordie Faithful expected that Joe Harvey’s Boys would kick on from there, but once again the expectations were greater than reality.\nAlthough we look back on those days with fondness, as the last success enjoyed by the incumbents of St James’ Park, let’s face it, the Inter Cities Fairs Cup doesn’t sit that high on the barometer of success.\nAt the time, the Fairs Cup was ranked third of the European Trophies after The European Cup (for all domestic league winners throughout Europe) and The European Cup Winners Cup (for the winners of all the various European football federations domestic cup competitions), both were ranked above the Inter Cities Fairs Cup, which later gave way to The UEFA Cup (which didn’t have the one club one city rule).\nThrough the years we have had brief flirtations with the three main English domestic competitions with second place finishes in the top division and final appearances in both the FA and League Cups, but again the expectations outweighed the reality.\nThen a couple of years ago Eddie Howe’s lads turned a relegation certainty into Champions League qualification, along with a League Cup final appearance. Again we dreamt of success, especially after the great win against PSG, only to be cruelly let down by a run of injuries that made our treatment room look like a battlefield hospital. Again the expectation gave way to the reality, at the end of last season we didn’t even qualify for any European Competition.\nAs things currently stand, once again our expectation levels have been lifted, Newcastle United sit fifth in the Premier League, plus we look forward to a League Cup semi-final. In two weeks time we will embark on another FA Cup quest, beginning with a game against lower league opposition, when we play Bromley (let’s hope it’s not another Hereford).\nHow many times do the greatest supporters in the land have to endure the let down of expectations. Will the current squad prove to be worthy of the expectations of a support who always fulfil any expectations laid on THEM.\nI have a dream, call it an expectation if you like.\nIn 2025, Newcastle United will win a domestic trophy for the first time since 1955 and also gain Champions League qualification via the Premier League.\nIn 2026 we will see further domestic cup success and a top three league finish, along with a decent run into the latter stages of the Champions League.\nIn 2027 we will lift the Premier League title, a full 100 years since we last won the top league, followed by winning the Champions League trophy.\nMy expectation, my dream, is of the St James’ Park maintenance staff having to build a new larger trophy cabinet in a redesigned, or new, St James’ Park.\nRealising the expectation of the Frank Watt days of a team enjoying success after success. A team truly worthy of the expectations of the Geordie Nation and making us truly Newcastle United.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
