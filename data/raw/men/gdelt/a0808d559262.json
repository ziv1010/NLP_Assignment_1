That’s nearly half my money gone before I even buy food.”\nMr Al Haddad, as a government employee, still receives a salary from the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank, even though Hamas has run Gaza since it seized control of the territory in 2007.\nMr Al Haddad is paid through online bank transfer, but cannot pay for goods digitally because banks in Gaza suspended a widely used payment app after several hacking attempts. In any case, most shops no longer accept such payments.\nHe believes the aid blockade and shortage of currency – the Israeli shekel is used in both Gaza and West Bank – is part of Israel’s war strategy. “It’s as if the occupation wants to create a new crisis, an economic collapse driven by cash shortages and rising hunger,” he said.\nMurid Al Mabhouh, 30, who was displaced from his home in Jabalia Camp to Gaza city, said the situation was “suffocating”.\n“We’re under siege, under bombardment, living through famine, and we have to pay 40 per cent just to withdraw the little money we have.”\nMr Al Mabhouh said people had no choice but to pay the high commissions charged by black market currency traders. “There are no functioning banks, no official oversight, and the authorities are silent. It’s not just exploitation, it’s injustice on top of injustice,” he said.\n“The money we’re trying to access is for food, medicine, and paying off debts. Now we lose nearly half of it to commission traders getting rich off our suffering.”\nMr Al Haddad said videos posted on social media showed that traders were able to import some goods in recent days, but “it’s all non-essential – instant noodles, snacks, breadcrumbs”.\n“And everything is cash only, at outrageous prices,” he said.\nAmid the outcry, Gaza’s Chamber of Commerce has accused some traders in Gaza of working with suspicious actors to obtain Israeli permits to import non-essential goods.\n“These permits are being sold for hundreds of thousands of shekels for a single truckload of items that people don’t even need,” said Aed Abu Ramadan, director of the Chambers of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture in Gaza, told The National. “This is unacceptable. It violates both commercial and national ethics.”\nHe said that such practices are draining the last of the population’s cash, pushing families to the brink while enriching a handful of traders. “We’ve urged merchants not to engage in these deals. They drive prices up, increase suffering, destabilise the market, and destroy any hope for fair competition.”\nMr Abu Ramadan called for immediate oversight by Gaza's authorities and co-operation with official agencies to prevent further economic manipulation. “People are already crushed. We must not let profiteering deepen this humanitarian catastrophe.”\nWith inflation spiralling, cash inaccessible, and markets flooded with overpriced, non-essential items, Gaza’s families are left with shrinking options. As financial lifelines disappear, aid dependency increases, and with it, fears of long-term economic and political manipulation.\n“This isn’t just about money,” Mr Al Haddad said. “It’s about dignity. About whether we’ll ever live normal lives again, or just survive, one overpriced bag of rice at a time.”",
