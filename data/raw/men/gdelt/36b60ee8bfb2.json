  "body_text": "Manchester United need midfield reinforcements given the possible departures of both Christian Eriksen and Casemiro once the summer window opens.\nThe Dane’s contract is up at the end of the season and the Red Devils have not offered him an extension as he no longer possesses the legs to operate in the big games.\nAs for the Brazilian, he has been reborn in recent weeks under Ruben Amorim, but his humongous wages mean INEOS remain keen to offload him.\nWith Kobbie Mainoo also yet to agree a new contract, it makes sense for the Red Devils to try and recruit an elite midfield presence to compensate for the loss in personnel.\nEderson top of United’s wishlist\nThe Peoples Person had relayed that United scouts have been watching Atalanta midfielder Ederson and the club had even got in touch with his representatives.\nNow, Fabrizio Romano has revealed to Givemesport the Brazilian is at the top of the club’s wishlist with Amorim demanding INEOS to sign him during recent transfer meetings.\nGiven the significant outlay required to land Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap or possibly Victor Osimhen, Champions League qualification could be key to landing the 25-year-old.\n“Sources guarantee to GIVEMESPORT that one of the names discussed again in one of the meetings between Man United directors and the Portuguese coach was the Brazilian midfielder Ederson.\nCL qualification could be key\n“He has the attributes Ruben Amorim wants. Man United already made contact a few months ago with the player’s camp to show their interest, along with more Premier League clubs, with the race considered absolutely open.\n“The understanding is that the contract in terms of salary would not be an issue for Ederson; but Champions League football can play an important role in this story as there are several clubs keen on the Brazilian.”\nEderson has five goals and two assists this season and can operate both as a defensive midfielder and as a No 8. Romano also revealed that he will cost way more than €45 million.\nWhether INEOS can muster up the required funds remains to be seen. The likes of Adam Wharton and Bruno Guimaraes are also being looked at while a couple of Championship starlets are also on the club’s radar.\nFeature image Francesco Scaccianoce via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
