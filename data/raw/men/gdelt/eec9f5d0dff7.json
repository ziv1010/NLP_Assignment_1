  "body_text": "Benfica and Monaco reconvene for 2nd leg of playoff\nWith a Champions League last-16 tie against either Barcelona or Liverpool on the line, Benfica and Monaco reconvene for the second leg of their playoff battle on Tuesday night at the Estadio da Luz.\nThe Portuguese powerhouses left the Stade Louis II with a 1-0 triumph to their name from last week’s first leg and now reunite with opponents hit with several suspension-related shortages.\nThe slender beating of Monaco marked the fourth win of a five-match victorious sequence for Benfica in all tournaments.\nIndeed, Benfica have scored at least three times in each of their last four matches at the Estadio da Luz in all tournaments, although one of those contests also saw them ship five to Barcelona in a nine-goal UCL spectacular, meaning that they have won just one of their last eight home games in the competition.\nBenfica’s home woes in the Champions League may pale into insignificance thanks to Monaco’s horrendous away form over the winter period, as they have lost each of their last four on the road and have only won one of their last 10 on their travels.\nHowever, Monaco polished off their best shooting boots on Saturday evening, when Nantes visited the Stade Louis II in Ligue 1 and left having been slaughtered 7-10.\nAll-out attack must be the formula for Monaco if they are to keep their Champions League dream alive, and the Biereth-inspired visitors should sense an opportunity against their depleted hosts.\nHowever, Hutter has also been left incredibly short in midfield for the second leg, and Benfica should therefore be able to fight fire with fire and progress after an end-to-end battle.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk\nFeyenoord takes a slender lead to faceAC Milan\nTaking a slender lead to San Siro, Feyenoord endeavour to finish the job on AC Milan when they reconvene for Tuesday’s Champions League playoff second leg.\nThe managerless Dutch titans stunned Sergio Conceicao‘s side to triumph 1-0 at De Kuip in their opening encounter, and a last-16 date with either Inter Milan or Arsenal will be their reward should they maintain or increase their narrow advantage.\nIndeed, the Rossoneri have only advanced from one of their last six Champions League knockout ties when losing the first leg – a terrific comeback job on Manchester United in the 2006-07 semi-finals – but home is still where the heart is for Conceicao’s outfit.\nWhen billed as the ‘home’ team at their shared San Siro headquarters, Milan have now strung together a 12-game run without defeat in all competitions since October’s 2-0 loss to Napoli, but they are still trailing the European places in the Serie A table and may have to go all the way in the 2024-25 UCL to punch their ticket to continental football again next term.\nHowever, with the Eredivisie outfit riddled by injuries and Milan fortifying the walls of their San Siro home of late, we can only envisage Conceicao’s troops atoning for their first-leg wrongs and setting up a potential mouthwatering Milan derby in the last 16.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk\nCeltic face an uphill task against Bayern Munich\nCeltic face an uphill battle on Tuesday at Allianz Arena, where they have to overturn a 2-1 first-left deficit away from home against Bayern Munich to reach the Champions League round of 16.\nHarry Kane and Michael Olise gave Bayern a two-goal advantage at Celtic Park last Wednesday, but Celtic’s Daizen Maeda halved the scoreline with just over 10 minutes remaining to give the Scottish champions a glimmer of hope.\nBayern also rode their luck during their 0-0 draw with Bundesliga champions Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday, with Xabi Alonso‘s side limiting the Bavarians to two shots and no efforts on target, while Leverkusen hit the woodwork twice and squandered numerous opportunities in front of goal.\nHowever, boss Vincent Kompany will argue that his team’s performance did not matter given they are currently eight points ahead of second-placed Leverkusen.\nKompany could also point to the fact his side have scored three or more goals in eight of their past 14 in all competitions, and their record of 65 goals scored in the league is the most in the top flight.\nThe Bavarians’ draw on the weekend was the first time they did not win in six matches and was only the second time they have not achieved victory in 11 outings.\nBayern will feel confident of progressing given they are unbeaten at home in the Champions League in 20 games, drawing on just four occasions in that time.\nThough Bayern have been somewhat weaker offensively in their past two games, their home record is phenomenal and they should be considered strong favourites.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk\nAtalanta to overturn one-goal deficit when they host Club Brugge\nAtalanta BC will try to overturn a one-goal deficit when they welcome Club Brugge to Gewiss Stadium for Tuesday’s second leg in the Champions League knockout round playoffs.\nThe hosts are looking to reach the Champions League last 16 for the first time since 2020-21, while the Belgian visitors are hoping to feature in the next stage for the second time in three seasons.\nAtalanta will have home advantage for the second leg after they entered the playoff round draw as a seeded team courtesy of their ninth-place finish in the league phase.\nHowever, they would have been disappointed to miss out on the automatic last-16 spot after they went into the final matchday of the league phase in seventh position, only to drop out following a 2-2 away draw against Barcelona.\nAtalanta experienced another frustrating outing in Saturday’s Serie A clash after they saw their title hopes dented by a goalless home draw against Cagliari, ensuring that they remained in third place and five points adrift of leaders Inter Milan.\nThey will now turn their focus to Tuesday’s crucial European encounter, where they may have their work cut out if they are to win a Champions League knockout tie for the second time in their history, having won just one of their previous six competitive home games.\nThe Belgian champions won three, drew two and lost three of their eight matches in the league phase, with two of those victories taking place at home against Aston Villa and Sporting Lisbon.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk",
