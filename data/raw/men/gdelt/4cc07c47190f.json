  "body_text": "Manchester United missed out on European football after recording their worst ever Premier League finish last term.\nStill, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and company splashed £225 million on new signings over the summer, raising plenty of eyebrows. The club’s recruitment team managed to convince players like Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko to reject Champions League clubs in favour of a move to the Theatre of Dreams.\nDespite their on-field struggles, the Red Devils can do unbelievable things in the transfer market. Now, a report in Spain suggests United have shown interest in signing one of the most high-profile players in world football.\nManchester United enter Neymar race\nAccording to Fichajes, United are interested in Brazilian icon Neymar.\nIt is claimed the 33-year-old wants a change of scenery amid his struggles at Santos. The Brazil international returned to his boyhood club early this year after parting ways with Al-Hilal.\nThe return of Brazil’s all-time top scorer was met with a lot of fanfare. However, Santos find themselves in a serious crisis and sit just a place above the relegation zone.\nThe ex-Barcelona superstar is considering leaving the club as he is keen to continue at the highest level to ensure a place in Carlo Ancelotti’s squad for the World Cup next summer.\nThe Spanish outlet claim United are looking to add firepower to their attack and believe Neymar fits the attacking profile they lack under Ruben Amorim.\nIt is understood the Premier League giants are in a position to afford Neymar’s wage demands “without difficulty”.\nA no-go from the start\nWhile it is true that Ineos are very ambitious and capable of making blockbuster moves, they are also cautious and their transfer strategy is data-driven, unlike previous decision makers.\nNeymar has not featured for Brazil since October 2023 due to frequent injury issues. At Santos, he has not managed to rediscover his form and full fitness, managing just three goals in 16 league appearances.\nRatcliffe has insisted he wants United to sign “the next Kylian Mbappe” rather than fight for marquee names. Neymar, meanwhile, is well past his best and appears to be at the tail end of his career.\nFinancially or from a sporting perspective, the idea doesn’t make sense. As such, it is best to take the claim with a pinch of salt.\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade.
