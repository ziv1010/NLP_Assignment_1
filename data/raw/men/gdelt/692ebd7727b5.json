  "body_text": "By Web Desk\nFebruary 22, 2023\nKevin de Bruyne and Aymeric Laporte have been ruled out of Manchester City's first leg of the UEFA Champions League's Round of 16 clash with RB Leipzig.\nThe two were not a part of the squad that travelled to Germany and did not participate in Tuesday's practise.\nDue to illness, both have been ruled out, according to manager Pep Guardiola.\nMeanwhile, owing to a thigh injury, defender John Stones will also miss the crucial clash but new signing Maximo Perrone is available for the match.\nManchester City will aim to win their maiden Champions League trophy this season.\nA painful 1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest on Saturday left them two points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal, so they are also looking to bounce back from that setback.\nGuardiola, however, was inspired by his team's performance despite the outcome.\n\"Last game against Nottingham was highest standards,\" he said. \"I loved the way we play and we don't win because it's football. I do not have an answer on what happened in that situation. Today we trained and it's there but that doesn't mean we'll win. But I have a good feeling.\"\nHe continued by saying that Leipzig, who sit fifth in the Bundesliga and four points behind Bayern Munich, would present a challenge for his team.\nOn the other hand, striker Erling Haaland will be the hardest obstacle for RB Leipzig to overcome, but manager Marco Rose is certain that his personal experience with the player would be beneficial to his team. The two previously worked together at Borussia Dortmund.\n\"If he sees the goal he is crazy about scoring. He is always there for the team, working for the team. He has improved his game a lot, his technical side, his movement, and the things around. Now he is playing for one of the best teams in the world and he is a world-class player,\" said Rose.\n\"But I have great confidence in my team. We want to compete against one of the best teams in the world, see and look for opportunities.\"\nThe match will kick off at 01:00 am (PST) on Thursday.\nRemaining fixtures for this week:\nRB Leipzig vs Manchester City - 01:00 am (PST) Thursday\nInter Milan vs Porto - 01:00 am (PST) Thursday",
