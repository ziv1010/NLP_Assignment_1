Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nAnother Chelsea legend, Joe Cole, backed Gudjohnsen’s assessment of Caicedo and said he is ‘worth every penny’ of his huge transfer fee.\n‘I can’t argue with that,’ Cole said in response to Gudjohnsen’s comments. ‘This club has been blessed with players in that position, you think of Makelele and Kante.\n‘They know when they see a good midfielder and these fans love Caicedo. There were question marks over him – £100m was a lot of money to spend – but he’s worth every penny.’\nCaicedo helped Chelsea beat ten-man Ajax 5-1 in the Champions League on Wednesday night, scoring his side’s second goal with a deflected long-range strike.\nMaresca’s side lost their Champions League opener to Bayern Munich but have bounced back with wins over Jose Mourinho’s Benfica and Ajax.\nCole was also complimentary of Caicedo before the Ajax game, insisting he would ‘not swap’ the Chelsea midfielder for anyone else in the game.\n‘He’s the best midfielder in the world between the boxes, and he’s improving at both ends of the pitch as well,’ Cole told Paddy Power. ‘I think he’s absolutely brilliant.\n‘In terms of breaking up play, playing it through the lines, being intelligent, driving the team forward, and he’s also adding goals to his game, and he scores great goals.\n‘I’m struggling to think of somebody I’d want in my midfield better than him at the moment, I really would. And that’s a massive shout.\nMore Trending\n‘But I wouldn’t swap him for anyone now at Chelsea.’\nChelsea’s emphatic victory over Ajax sees them climb into the top-half of the Champions League table. They return to Premier League action on Saturday against Sunderland.\nAfter Chelsea brushed aside Ajax, ex-England goalkeeper Paul Robinson said: ‘Ajax were waiting for the final whistle since that fifth goal went in after half-time. It has been a soul-destroying game for them.\n‘A very good confidence builder for Chelsea. I have not seen a team this dominant in the Champions League for an hour in a game.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Chelsea 5-1 Ajax player ratings: Jamie Gittens shines but Tosin Adarabioyo poor\nMORE: Danny Murphy says one team are ‘on another level’ to Arsenal and Liverpool\nMORE: Man Utd monitoring £43m ‘next big star’ ahead of January transfer window",
