  "body_text": "Paul Parker has named Harry Maguire as Manchester United’s weak link for their Europa League semi-final clash against Athletic Bilbao tonight.\nThe Red Devils are in Spain for the first leg – aiming to continue their push for the trophy – which would somewhat save their otherwise poor season.\nIt won’t be an easy task against the La Liga side, who have a number of impressive stars such as Nico Williams, one of Europe’s hottest prospects.\nSpeaking before the match, ex-United right-back Parker has told Metro that Athletic Bilbao may look to exploit the Red Devils’ lack of defensive pace.\nHe specifically called out centre-back Maguire as one of United’s main weaknesses but also admits the club have problems all over the pitch.\n‘When you look at them (United) defensively, they lack pace,’ Parker said via Online Casino.\n‘They lack pace in the back three and they sit far too deep so they allow teams to come onto them. They seem content with Maguire playing as a centre-back.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

He’s a bit old school. He’d would’ve been great in the 1980s and 1990s with me. He would’ve been even better in the 1970s.’\nParker is also adamant that United have one of the worst attacks in the Premier League and feels the Red Devils lack creativity in midfield.\n‘We have to say at the top end, it’s maybe the poorest in the Premier League,’ Parker added. ‘The proof is there when you look at how many goals they’ve scored.\n‘You look in midfield, there isn’t great creativity. They’re relying on one person (Bruno Fernandes) to try and do something but he’s quite undependable because he’s ill-disciplined.’\nMeanwhile, Parker has argued that United may end up having a better season than Arsenal if they manage to win the Europa League title.\nLike United, Arsenal only have one chance left of landing a trophy this term, with the Gunners having reached the last four in the Champions League.\nThe Champions League is, of course, more prestigious than the Europa League but Arsenal lost 1-0 at home to PSG in the first leg on Tuesday.\nMore Trending\nParker says his former club would’ve had a more successful season than Arsenal if the Gunners miss out on the Champions League trophy and United win the Europa League.\n‘Yeah, it would be (a more successful season for United if that happened),’ Parker said. ‘It’s making me chuckle, really. Arsenal have been there – flickering at the top – all the PR stunts they’ve been throwing out there. They’ve been doing everything to pump themselves up.\n‘If you’re an Arsenal fan, you’d be a bit disappointed really. You want them (the team) to give you something to cheer about, not them telling you to cheer. When you look at it, United have been awful this season, but if they were to win it (the Europa League) – there would be no argument.\n‘They’d have a bit of silverware. At this moment in time, you have to say United have a good chance of winning it (the Europa League). I don’t think Arsenal can fight back (against PSG) in the Champions League.’\nMORE: Will Chelsea give Liverpool a guard of honour? ‘Embarrassing’ football tradition explained\nMORE: ‘It’s beyond me’ – Ole Gunnar Solskjaer slams Man Utd over £25m transfer\nMORE: Is Brentford vs Man Utd on TV today?
