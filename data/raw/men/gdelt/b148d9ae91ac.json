He scored so many goals …” he said.\nAjax have also sold midfielder Kenneth Taylor to Italian club Lazio for €16.9 million, a deal that will give the club more financial legroom in the transfer window.\nThe 23-year-old Netherlands international was pitched straight into the first team for an away match at Hellas Verona, which Lazio won 1-0. His team-mates included another Dutchman, former Fortuna Sittard striker Tijjani Noslin, who joined Lazio from Verona in 2024.\nExit Avila\nTaylor scored 36 goals in 184 matches for Ajax, but will hope to establish himself as an international player during his spell in Italy. After being called up to the Netherlands squad for the first time in 2022 he has won just five international caps.\nAjax have also loaned out Argentinian defender Gaston Avila to his former club Rosario Central. The 24-year-old was signed by former director of football Sven Mislintat for €12.5 million in 2023, but played just eight first-team games during a turbulent period for the club.\nThe biggest domestic move of the transfer window so far has seen Heracles Almelo’s top scorer Jizz Hornkamp move to AZ Alkmaar for around €4.6 million. Hornkamp has been joined in Alkmaar by winger Ayoub Oufkir, who was signed from Sparta Rotterdam.\nFeyenoord have bought no players so far, but Julian Carranza, who scored the goal that knocked Milan out of last year’s Champions League, has been sold to Mexican club Necaxa.\nThe 25-year-old Argentinian striker spent the first part of the season on loan at English Championship club Leicester City but played just nine first-team matches.\nPSV have made no moves either, but Peter Bosz is expected to look for a striker after Ricardo Pepi broke his forearm in the weekend win against Excelsior, which has put the American out of action for at least two months.\nThank you for donating to DutchNews.nl.\nWe could not provide the Dutch News service, and keep it free of charge, without the generous support of our readers.
