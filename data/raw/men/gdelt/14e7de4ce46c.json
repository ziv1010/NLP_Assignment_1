Chronicling his personal and professional life before and after the near-fatal horseback riding accident in 1995 that left him paralyzed from the neck down, SUPER/MAN: THE CHRISTOPHER REEVE STORY uses Reeve's own words, as well as intimate input from his closest family members and friends, to paint a rich, nuanced portrait of a man who refused to be defined by his physicality and who proved that you don't need tights and a cape to be a hero.\nCredits: DC Studios presents in association with HBO Documentary Films and CNN Films in association with Words+Pictures, a Passion Pictures and Misfits Entertainment production in association with Jenco Films. Directed by Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui; editor, Otto Burnham, composer, Ilan Eshkeri; produced by Lizzie Gillett, Robert Ford, Ian Bonhôte; director of photography, Brett Wiley; executive producers, Connor Schell, Libby Geist, Marie Margolius, Mark Meatto, Andrew Ruhemann, David Moulton, Andee Ryder, Daniel Kilroy; written by, Peter Ettedgui; co-written by, Ian Bonhôte and Otto Burnham.\nDebuts December 10\nHBO Original Documentary\nNATURE OF THE CRIME\nLogline: Every day, thousands of people are sentenced to prison with the possibility of parole, which grants release back into their communities. The life-changing decision of whether parole is ultimately granted - and who decides - is an aspect of the U.S. criminal justice system with little oversight that is often shielded from public scrutiny, mired in political considerations and little understood. This film follows two men convicted of murder in New York when they were teens, their attorneys, and their family members, as they prepare for their upcoming parole interviews, reflecting on their crimes, their rehabilitation, and the criteria for decisions about their potential release. The film also follows another incarcerated man going through the parole process in Connecticut, a state that recently reformed its process to allow for public observation and additional legal protections.\nCredits: HBO Documentary Films presents NATURE OF THE CRIME, a Break Thru Films Production. Produced, directed, and written by Ricki Stern and Jesse Sweet; senior producer, Seth Keal; executive producers, Joe Caterini and Logan Snyder.\nDebuts December 12\nMax Original Comedy Series\nBOOKIE S2\n8 Episodes\nRollout: Episodes debut weekly at 9 p.m. ET\nLogline: From Emmy(R)-nominated creator Chuck Lorre (\"The Big Bang Theory\") and Nick Bakay, this darkly funny comedy follows veteran Los Angeles bookie Danny (Sebastian Maniscalco) as the potential legalization of sports gambling in California threatens to upend his business for good. Alongside best friend and former NFL player Ray (Omar J. Dorsey), side-hustling sister Lorraine (Vanessa Ferlito), and reluctantly reformed drug dealer Hector (Jorge Garcia), Danny must contend with his increasingly unstable clients as he tries to settle their debts - all while making plenty of risky bets of his own. Full of relatable mishaps, Bookie chronicles one man's journey to adapt to an ever-changing world as he attempts to charm and con his way to the top.\nS2 Cast: Stars Sebastian Maniscalco, Omar J. Dorsey, Vanessa Ferlito, Jorge Garcia, Andrea Anders, Maxim Swinton and Rob Corddry.

Building her hourlong set around a 16,000-word note kept over time on her phone, Matafeo leans into her insightful and self-deprecating humor to share candid takes on relationships - from dating in her 20s vs. 30s to supporting friends through breakups and the stark differences between herself and her parents at the same age. The comedian also explores whether she wants children, how aging has impacted her comedy, and her strong feelings about online relationship coaching. Filmed live at London's Britten Theatre, ROSE MATAFEO: ON AND ON AND ON reflects on the difficulties of endings as well as the seemingly endless loops that shape our lives.\nCredits: Written and performed by Rose Matafeo; directed by Barbara Wiltshire; executive producers, Richard Allen-Turner, Cath Gagon, Alice Snedden, Jon Thoday, and Rose Matafeo. Produced by Avalon.\nDebuts December 20\nMax Original Film\nJUROR #2\nLogline: The film follows family man Justin Kemp (Nicholas Hoult) who, while serving as a juror in a high-profile murder trial, finds himself struggling with a serious moral dilemma... one he could use to sway the jury verdict and potentially convict - or free - the accused killer.\nCast: The film stars Nicholas Hoult, Oscar(R) nominee Toni Collette, Oscar(R) winner J.K.
