Here are the players the Reds should be wary of.\nTeun Koopmeiners\n- Position: Midfielder\n- Fun fact: Came up with the assist for Wout Weghorst's equaliser in Netherlands 2-2 Argentina at the 2022 World Cup\nA man whose name will likely be familiar to Liverpool fans who love transfer rumours is Teun Koopmeiners.\nThe Netherlands international has openly admitted he wants to leave this summer, with Juventus and Liverpool among the teams persistently linked with a move for him.\nKoopmeiners started his career as a deep-lying midfielder who was also capable of filling in at centre-back, but he's excelled this season in a more advanced role behind the strikers, contributing 13 goals in 37 games.\nEderson\n- Position: Midfielder\n- Fun fact: Spent part of his youth career on loan at Chinese side Shandong Taishan\nAnother gossip column regular is Ederson (no, obviously not that one).\nThough he remains uncapped by Brazil - a tough ask considering midfielders from Fulham, West Ham and Wolves are getting in nowadays - Ederson is firmly one of the best up-and-coming stars in Serie A.\nHe is likely to start at the base of a midfield which also features ex-Middlesbrough man and Twitter extraordinaire Marten de Roon.\nAdemola Lookman\n- Position: Forward\n- Fun fact: Full name is Ademola Lookman Olajade Alade Aylola Lookman\nFormer Everton forward Ademola Lookman will be keen to get one over his old rivals on Thursday night.\nAfter bouncing round from club-to-club in the early portion of his career, Wandsworth native and Nigerian hero Lookman seems to have found a home at Atalanta, bringing mobility and a cutting edge to their attack in a front two.\nGianluca Scamacca\n- Position: Forward\n- Fun fact: Don't really have one, but click here to take a trip back in time to the 1990s (via 2022) with the lovely James Richardson\nAh, a jumpscare for any West Ham fans who might have stumbled across this.\nIn fairness to Gianluca Scamacca, it's hard to blame him too much for his underwhelming time in east London - he doesn't play like the target man David Moyes craved, he just so happens to be really tall.\nHaving battled injuries earlier in the season, Scamacca has returned to form recently and will want to rewrite any lingering narrative left on these shores from his Premier League days.\nIsak Hien\n- Position: Defender\n- Fun fact: You can make a great Richard Osman answer-smash with him and Sweden teammate Alexander Isak\nThere's no guarantee Isak Hien starts on Thursday night, but would you rather read about him or Premier League flops Sead Kolasinac and Davide Zappacosta? Yeah, that's what I thought.\nIn fairness to Hien, he's adapted well to life with Atalanta so far having only made the move from Hellas Verona in January, while he was still playing club football in his native Sweden only two years ago.\nHien is a mobile and physical aerial threat - we need to see him battle Darwin Nunez.",
