We are good. We’ll see what happens.”\nTuesday’s humbling in Portugal came on the back of the Premier League loss at Bournemouth and a Carabao Cup defeat away to Tottenham.\nFollowing the Champions League loss, Bernardo Silva said City were “in a dark place” but asked if he had needed to reassure his players and give them confidence, Guardiola said no.\n“I don’t think so,” he said. “We are not used to three different games in three different competitions, but it’s football, it’s happened. We know the reason why we struggle.\n“We’re looking forward to the game, then international break. After that, a few players come back better, we recover. All the problems we have we will solve it.”\nAnd asked if he had learned more about his players during this run, Guardiola again said not.\n“I’ve known them for many years,” he said. “They prove many times what they’re capable of. They don’t change my opinion, sometimes it happens.”\nBrighton will present another difficult challenge for a City side a long way from their best. Fabian Hurzeler’s side are eighth in the Premier League, having lost only two games this season.\n“I’m really impressed for the way they play,” he said. “I think Roberto De Zerbi did an incredible job there. Brighton made a lot of signings this season, and (Hurzeler’s) doing an incredible job for the personality and the rhythm.\n“They way they played their last two games against Liverpool, of course the results were not good, but they played really good and it has always been tough, since Graham Potter, away or at home, it doesn’t matter and tomorrow will be no exception.”",
