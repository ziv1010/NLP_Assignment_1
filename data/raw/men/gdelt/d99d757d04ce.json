I don’t know if 100% of Madrid fans would, but a very high percentage.\n“If you were to ask Madrid fans if they’d want the Brazilian to leave so someone like Vitinha could come in, I’d say a significant percentage would sign it.”\nWhile noting Madrid’s failure to sign Zubimendi in the summer of 2025, Pulido said: “What I find newsworthy is that Madrid has finally realised it needs that type of player.\n“Until now, the internal discourse was that Xabi Alonso had to make this team play with Guller and Bellingham in that position, and it has been shown that this isn’t enough.\n“Madrid needs a player who makes the team play, who breaks lines, who plays long balls, who is the Kroos they’ve lost.”\nWant more breaking transfer lines from original sources?
