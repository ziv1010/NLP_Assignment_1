They are out of the FA Cup and the team have regressed under him. There are many reasons behind it, but you can't get away from that.\"\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests.\nFor week 28, he takes on Bath and Scotland rugby star Finn Russell.\nYou can watch Scotland's Six Nations game against Wales on Saturday at 16:45 GMT on BBC One and listen to live commentary on Radio 5 Live.\nDo you agree with their scores? You can make your own below.\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\nRussell went viral last year when he joked on a Netflix documentary that he was \"rugby's Lionel Messi\" but he was only trying to describe the mix of flair, flicks, kicks and tricks that make his position at fly-half the creative equivalent of a playmaker in football.\n\"That was the comparison I was trying to make rather than trying to say I was at his level, but it just ended up being taken out of context,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"I'd been chatting to the guys who make the Open Goal podcast in Scotland and they were saying how Messi would kind of control the tempo and control the game.\n\"He calls all the shots, and decides what the team does which, in my position as a fly-half or a number 10, is my job too - like a number 10 in football, pretty much all the attacks go through us at some point, and we dictate what happens.\n\"There are similarities in the demands of other positions in football and rugby too. If you are out on the wings in either sport then you've usually got a bit of speed haven't you?\n\"And I don't know exactly what the equivalent of a centre-half would be in rugby - someone on the back row or a number eight, something like that, but in both sports those are the positions where there is a lot of contact and it is very physical.\n\"So there are lots of similar demands across both sports - I guess I just made the mistake of mentioning Messi as part of that, when he has won a good few trophies more than me!\"\nChris Sutton and Finn Russell were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nPremier League predictions\nSaturday, 8 March\nThis is a big game in the race for the Champions League places, and a tough one to call.\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola rested a few players for last weekend's FA Cup win over Plymouth and Erling Haaland is fit again.\nNottingham Forest are at home but their fans don't mind them sitting in and hitting teams on the break, which is what they will do here.\nIt wasn't so long ago people were lauding Forest, but they have not won in the Premier League since beating Brighton 7-0 on 1 February.\nI don't think there is too much wrong with Nuno Espirito Santo's team though. They are still in the FA Cup and, in the league, they have lost narrowly away to Fulham and Newcastle and then they drew with Arsenal, which seemed a decent result to me.\nI had a look at Forest's remaining 11 league games and, in the reverse fixtures this season, they have won nine, drawn one and lost one.\nThat shows that if they keep their squad fit and available then they have got a great chance of a top-five finish, which will probably get them in the Champions League.\nTheir one defeat in that sequence above actually came when they were well beaten by Manchester City at the start of December.\nIt will be much closer this time but, although I hate to go against my boyhood club, I still fancy City to nick the points. I know for a fact that the readers will go for a draw here, but I am picking a winner.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2\nFinn's prediction: Forest are having such a good season. I reckon they can take this one. 2-0\nFull-time: 1-0 - read the match report\nWho does Finn support? My partner's family are big Celtic fans and I used to live in a flat down the road from Ibrox so I have been to watch both - but I don't really support anyone to be honest. I have been to a few football games and I love the atmosphere, but I have not really got a team that I follow.\nBoth of these teams are doing well and whoever wins it will feel like they are right in the mix for a top-five finish.\nBrighton are on their best run of the season and have won five games in a row since their 7-0 defeat by Nottingham Forest, while Fulham have won four of their past five away league games.\nYou could make a case for both teams, but that does not really help me to make a prediction, does it?\nFulham won the reverse fixture 3-1, in December, but the Seagulls were having a bit of a wobble at that point and clearly their form is very different now.\nI feel like anything could happen here so there is no science behind this prediction, but I am going to go with my instincts.\nMy gut feeling is that we will get a winner... and I am picking Brighton to take the points.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nFinn's prediction: Brighton being at home should give them the edge. 1-0\nThe question is how Crystal Palace are going to cope without Jean-Philippe Mateta, who was injured in their FA Cup win over Millwall.\nMateta scored the winner when Palace beat Ipswich at Portman Road in December, but it is not just his goals that the Eagles will miss - it's his presence up front that has been so important for them too.\nI am guessing Eddie Nketiah will lead their attack in his absence, and this is a big chance for him to shine.\nThere was heartbreak for Ipswich in the FA Cup, losing on penalties to Nottingham Forest, and now all they have to look forward to is a relegation fight.\nThe Tractor Boys have not won a league game this year, a run of eight games, so can they get something at Palace? I don't think so.\nSutton's prediction: 1-0\nFinn's prediction: A draw seems about right. 1-1\nI am at this game for 5 Live and I would not be surprised if Liverpool make quite a few changes.\nThey have got a big lead at the top of the Premier League but they still have work to do in the Champions League against Paris St-Germain next week. They got a great win in the first leg in Paris but that tie certainly isn't over.\nIf Reds boss Arne Slot had a third team, he might think about using it here - but he can probably get away with playing his second team and still being too strong for Saints.\nIt is around 230 miles from Southampton to Liverpool, and fair play to any Saints fans who make the trip - they are absolute die-hards because they are not getting anything at Anfield.\nI would be saving my petrol money, because they know they are getting beaten, same as they know they are getting relegated this season.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nFinn's prediction: Liverpool are going so well, while Southampton are having a shocker. 4-0\nThis should be a really good game - it is 11th versus 10th but both teams are looking up the table and thinking about getting into the European places.\nIt feels like it will be close but I am actually pretty sure Brentford will win it - Villa have been stretched all season and we know they tend to be a bit flat the weekend following a Champions League match.\nThat's the test for Unai Emery's side here. Can they break that habit of dropping points after playing in Europe? I'm not convinced.\nVilla are in a strong position against Club Brugge after their first-leg win in Belgium but, if they are at all tired from that game, then Brentford's energy means they are not a team you would want to face.\nI'm going for Villa striker Ollie Watkins to score against his former club, but I am backing the Bees to take the points.\nThe rest of Villa's season is going to be a balancing act too - I'd back them to beat Brugge next week and make the quarter-finals, and also to overcome Preston in the last eight of the FA Cup.\nBut at the same time they really need a run of results in the Premier League to help them in the race for the top five. Right now they are still in touch with the teams above them but they have got to be careful not to slide out of contention there.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nFinn's prediction: John McGinn is going to make the difference here. 1-2\nI keep on expecting Everton to slip up under David Moyes but it has not happened yet.\nI think their fans are quite enjoying seeing me writing them off, and then being proved wrong when they get a positive result.\nSince losing his first game back in charge, against Aston Villa, Moyes has won four and drawn three in the Premier League, which is seriously impressive.\nBearing that in mind, I am not going to predict an Everton defeat here, but this game smells of a draw to me even though Wolves will be without the suspended Matheus Cunha.\nCunha lost the plot at the end of their FA Cup defeat by Bournemouth and is waiting to discover what his punishment will be.\nWolves are five points ahead of Ipswich and Leicester, who are 18th and 19th, so they do have some breathing space above the bottom three.\nFive points feels like a massive advantage at the moment, but we will find out over the next few weeks exactly how much Cunha has cost them in their fight against relegation.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nFinn's prediction: Let's go with Moyes getting another win.1-2\nSunday, 9 March\nAfter beating Southampton last time out, this feels like another 'gimme' for Chelsea, and just when they needed it too.\nWith the two teams immediately above them, Nottingham Forest and Manchester City, playing each other on Saturday, Chelsea could end up as high as third if they win this and, let's face it, they are very likely to take the three points.\nI am sure Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca will say lots of nice things about his former club but he will be absolutely desperate to pump them here.\nI think they will win easily, too. I feel sorry for Leicester boss Ruud van Nistelrooy because he has been dealt a terrible hand, and in the background there is frustration from the Foxes fans about the running of the club.\nIt feels like there was muddled thinking from the club's owners to appoint Van Nistelrooy, based on the fact he had beaten them while he was in caretaker charge of Manchester United.\nLots of managers could have got the job if that was the criteria. I would even have fancied my Lincoln City team from a few years back to have beaten Leicester this season so I could have ended up manager there.\nI guess that shows any unhappy fans that things could always be worse.\nSutton's prediction: 3-0\nFinn's prediction: 3-1\nThere has been talk about Tottenham wanting Andoni Iraola as their next manager if they sack Ange Postecoglou. His stock is very high at the moment, but the Bournemouth boss will just be focused on trying to secure a top-five finish.\nSpurs' season is really all about how they do in the Europa League now rather than their league position.\nThey do have some of their big-hitters like Dominic Solanke, Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero coming back from injury, but the question is how match-sharp will they be, and also how much Thursday's tie with AZ Alkmaar will take out of them.\nBournemouth have already beaten Spurs once this season, winning 1-0 on the south coast in December.\nThe Cherries play forward quickly and I am expecting them to cause Spurs more problems this time. There will definitely be goals in this, but I reckon Tottenham will score a couple too.\nSutton's prediction: 2-2\nFinn's prediction: There will be some goals here. 3-2\nI was in Eindhoven on Tuesday to cover Arsenal in the Champions League for 5 Live, and it's a lovely place.\nEindhoven is the design capital of the Netherlands, known for being a city of innovation and creativity - two of the things Manchester United are sorely lacking at the moment.\nArsenal have struggled to score in the Premier League but the goals were flowing freely for them against PSV and this feels like it is going to be another rearguard action for Manchester United, similar to the way they got past the Gunners in the FA Cup.\nUnited do seem to, somehow, raise their game against the better teams and that is the only way they are going to make this close.\nI still think Arsenal will win it, though.\nTuesday was the first time I have seen Ethan Nwaneri play in the flesh and I was really impressed with his performance for Mikel Arteta's team.\nDeclan Rice was immense in midfield and Martin Odegaard was excellent too. There has been some criticism of his form recently but he really delivered in that game.\nSo, although United might try to make things hard for them, I definitely think Arsenal will find a way through.\nThey won't score seven again, but this game has got all the hallmarks of ending up 1-0 to the Arsenal.\nSutton's prediction: 0-1\nFinn's prediction: 1-2\nMonday, 10 March\nLondon Stadium, 20:00 GMT\nWest Ham are showing signs of improvement under Graham Potter and are going for a third-straight win.\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe's first problem is who is fit and available.\nI don't think Howe will rest anyone ahead of next weekend's Carabao Cup final, because his side are still going for a top-five finish and it would be huge for the club if they make it back into the Champions League.\nBut there is a doubt over Alexander Isak, Lewis Hall is out for the season and Anthony Gordon is suspended after his red card against Brighton - I saw someone call him 'Rash Gordon' which is a great line.\nAll of that, on top of West Ham's current form, makes me think this will end up in a draw.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nFinn's prediction: 1-3\nHow did Sutton do in the FA Cup?\nChris, his guest Josh Widdicombe and the BBC readers all picked six of the eight winners in round five.\nWhile Josh wrongly thought Manchester United could reach the final again this year, Chris and the BBC readers correctly forecast that they would lose to Fulham.\nOut of almost 40,000 predictions, 63% of you were right that the holders would bow out.\nHow did Sutton do last time?\nThe last set of Premier League fixtures, played in midweek last week, was decided by the final game of week 27.\nBefore West Ham played Leicester on 27 February, Chris and his guest, singer Paige Cavell, both had six correct results from nine games, with one exact score, and were tied on 90 points.\nPaige wrongly went for a 1-1 draw so did not add to her tally, but Chris was spot on with his 2-0 prediction, meaning he ended up on 130 points.\nThe BBC readers also landed 40 points from the Hammers-Foxes game. Using the most popular scoreline from their predictions for each game, they ended up with four correct results and one exact score overall, for a total of 70 points.",
