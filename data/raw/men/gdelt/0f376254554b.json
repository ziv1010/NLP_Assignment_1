  "body_text": "Manchester United secured a 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on Saturday, 7 November, in the Premier League, marking their fourth consecutive victory. Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes scored the goals to ensure that the Red Devils remain fourth in the Premier League table after 25 games, just three points behind Aston Villa in third.\nThe team has been firing on all cylinders since caretaker manager Michael Carrick’s arrival last month, but one player who has been consistently good this season is Luke Shaw. The Englishman has started all 25 games in the Premier League for the English giants, and has clocked 2,183 minutes of league football this campaign, the most in the first-team squad.\nFrom playing as a left centre-back under former head coach Ruben Amorim to slotting in effortlessly at left-back under Carrick, the English full-back has been rolling back the years this season. However, Shaw is due to turn 31 this summer, and his contract expires at the end of next campaign.\nThe situation has prompted the Red Devils to lay down succession plans, and previous reports have suggested that they have found their man in Eintracht Frankfurt left-back Nathaniel Brown.\nBundesliga’s emerging star\nBrown has been outstanding for the Bundesliga club this season, registering two goals and six assists in 29 appearances in all competitions, all but four of which were starts.\nNathaniel Brown Stats: 2025/26 Season\nSource: Transfermarkt.\nThe German rose through the ranks at FC Nurnberg before breaking into the first team with the Bavarian club. His efforts caught the eyes of Frankfurt, and he moved to the Deutsche Bank Park in January 2024.\nThe 22 year old has emerged as one of the Bundesliga’s most exciting young left-backs of late and has subsequently turned heads at Old Trafford. While United have Patrick Dorgu in their ranks, Brown represents an opportunity for the Premier League giants to add more cover to the position.\nThe Red Devils reportedly considered a late move for the player in January following the Dane’s injury, although the transfer did not materialise. It now appears that they could face competition from LaLiga in the race for the German star.\nReal Madrid want Brown\nAccording to Fichajes, Real Madrid have identified Brown as a possible option to upgrade their left-back position this year. The LaLiga giants are already planning for squad reinforcements after a difficult campaign so far.\nThe German has been identified as a possible replacement for Fran Garcia, who could be on his way out this summer. Brown is under contract until 2030, but the report adds that he could be available for €25-30 million.\nLos Blancos hope to raise a similar amount from Garcia’s departure, which could fund the deal. The German’s entourage is reportedly open to a move to Spain, which could add to United’s troubles.\nThe lure of a move to the Santiago Bernabeu could be hard to turn down. While there have been some contacts between the two parties, nothing concrete has emerged, so the Red Devils have to move fast if they wish to get their man.\nFinal Thoughts\nUnited have preferred to replenish their squad with Premier League-proven candidates of late, which raises questions about a move for Brown. However, given the player’s spectacular rise, and the affordable fee, the German could be a superb long-term successor to Shaw at the Theatre of Dreams.\nFeature image Alex Grimm via Getty Images\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade.
