  "body_text": "Over the years, quite a few players have made the move from Chelsea to Manchester United. Some names that come to mind immediately are Juan Mata, Nemanja Matic and Mason Mount. On the other hand, this summer, we saw Alejandro Garnacho swap Old Trafford for Stamford Bridge. Could there be more transfers involving the two clubs in the future?\nBoth teams are in a position where they need to improve their squads. And it looks like a Chelsea midfielder is on the radar of Manchester United at the moment.\nAs reported by talkSPORT (via BBC), Manchester United are open to signing two new midfielders in 2026. Andrey Santos is among a six-man shortlist for Ruben Amorim's side.\nAt this point in time, it does not look like Chelsea are keen on parting ways with Santos though. There was interest in him this summer as well but the Blues resisted any transfer move. That is not expected to change anytime soon.\nManchester United interested in signing £50m Chelsea player\nSantos is not a starter for Chelsea at the moment. That is very true. That being said, he seems to be one of Enzo Maresca's favourite options to bring off the bench.\nHe is getting consistent playing time off the bench for Chelsea right now and is involved in the Brazil national team picture as well. So, all things considered, there is very little reason for him to consider an exit at this time.\nHow many promising youngsters have we seen join Manchester United in recent years and then struggle? Quite a few. In fact, the aforementioned Mount falls under that category. Once one of the brightest prospects in world football and a Champions League winner with Chelsea, he has done nothing of note since heading to Old Trafford.\nFor now, Chelsea might be the best place for Santos to develop his game. Eventually, the goal will be to become a starter. If he cannot make that jump, perhaps then, an exit would be worth thinking about.",
