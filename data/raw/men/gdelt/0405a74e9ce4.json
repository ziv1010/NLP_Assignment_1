City went on to win a League, FA Cup, and Champions League treble, while Arsenal settled for the consolation of a return to Champions League football after a six-year hiatus.\nBoth teams will clash at Wembley for the first silverware of the season on Sunday, live on SuperSport Football (DStv ch 205 and GOtv ch 61), at 4pm.\nArsenal lost three of their meetings with City last season, scoring two and conceding eight goals. Despite going into the match as underdogs, Arteta’s men will be buoyed by the fact that their last victory over City came at Wembley three years ago, when they defeated the Citizens 2-0, against all odds, in a FA Cup semi-final match.\nThe Gunners have also won the Community Shield in their last four attempts, including a 3-0 victory against Manchester City in the 2014 edition.\nEnjoy the Community Shield and other interesting live football matches across Europe this season on DStv Compact, Compact Plus, and GOtv Supa+.",
