Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nGiven the speed and bend on Rice’s effort, an extra man may have proved futile but Courtois nevertheless felt responsible for Arsenal’s opener.\n‘I thought I’d positioned the wall well,’ Courtois told Movistar. ‘I usually put an extra man in.\n‘I take responsibility for that. I could have put an extra man in, but I thought [Rice] wouldn’t get as much curl on it.\n‘The second goal is a great goal but they were unnecessary fouls, when there was no danger. Perhaps we shouldn’t make those fouls.’\nSpeaking about Real Madrid’s defeat more generally, Courtois – one of the best goalkeepers in the world – added: ‘Arsenal are a strong team, especially at home.\n‘They press well, play between the lines and created many dangerous situations. We held on well in the first half and created some openings but we forgot how to play in the second half.\n‘There was a bit of, I wouldn’t say panic, but we were not calm enough on the ball and then they scored two great free-kicks.’\nRice, meanwhile, revealed after the game he was ‘going to cross’ the ball rather than shoot before his first goal against Real Madrid.\n‘It’s been in the locker! But I’ve hit the wall too many times or it’s gone over the bar,’ he said.\n‘Originally we were going to cross, but I saw the wall and the goalkeeper’s position, so I thought for the first one, just go for it.\nMore Trending\n‘It’s not hit me yet, because there’s the second leg to go and I’m excited, happy, over the moon. In a few years, I think this will hit that what I did tonight was really special.’\nMikel Arteta looked stunned when Rice put his second free-kick into the top corner and discussed the two goals in his post-match press conference.\n‘Declan has been very determined because we’ve told him over the last few months that we hadn’t scored a direct free kick since September 2021,’ he said.\n‘It’s been a long time, so to score two goals of that quality and magnitude, from the same player who has never scored a free kick before in his career, what are the odds?’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Rio Ferdinand tells Man Utd to sign England star ahead of Liverpool and Real Madrid\nMORE: Wayne Rooney praises Arsenal star who ‘passed big test’ against Real Madrid\nMORE: Bukayo Saka injury update after Arsenal’s Champions League victory v Real Madrid",
