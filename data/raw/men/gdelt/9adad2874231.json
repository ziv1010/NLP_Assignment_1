It will be a top football game and I’m really happy we can play it now,” Klopp said at his pre-match press conference on Monday.\n“If it had been four weeks ago maybe it would’ve been different, but life is all about timing and maybe we found our feet right in time for this game.\n“Now we have these two results and hopefully we can build on it, but we need to play two super games to get through.”\nMadrid have been Liverpool’s conquerors in the Champions League three times in the previous five seasons.\nThe European champions won the 2018 final in Kyiv 3-1 and by the same score on aggregate in a quarter-final tie between the sides in 2020/2021.\n– ‘Torture’ –\nBut Carlo Ancelotti’s men rode their luck to win in Paris, with goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois picking up the man-of-the-match award for a series of stunning saves.\n“We played this final in Paris and I didn’t watch it back since then until this weekend,” said Klopp. “Now I know why I didn’t watch it back. It was proper torture because we played a good game and could have won the game.\n“They scored a decisive goal, we didn’t and it was the reason. You could see in this game how experienced Madrid is. How little they are fussed when the other team has chances.\n“They don’t lose confidence for one second, that is what you can learn from them.”\nAn independent report into the chaos surrounding the 2022 final published last week cleared fans of any responsibility.\nEuropean football’s governing body UEFA and the French authorities were blamed for failures “which almost led to disaster”.\nBut Klopp does not believe those scenes should impact Tuesday’s clash, given there was no animosity between the sets of supporters or clubs.\n“I don’t think we needed the Paris game to make this a special game,” said Klopp.\n“As a sportsperson we lost the game and that’s the good thing about sports — we want to put things right. That’s what we try. Nothing was the responsibility of Real Madrid or our people.\n“If that game wouldn’t have happened this would be a massive game tomorrow night. Our people are football people and Real Madrid are in town. Celebrate this event in the best possible way.”",
