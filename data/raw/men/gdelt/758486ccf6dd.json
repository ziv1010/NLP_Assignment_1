Kroos retired from football following the conclusion of Euro 2024 in Germany, while Nacho left Santiago Bernabeu for Saudi Pro League.\nReal Madrid’s experienced defender, David Alaba is expected to miss the game as he is currently recovering from a lengthy ACL injury.\nHowever, Carlo Ancelotti’s side have strengthened their squad with new arrivals like Kylian Mbappe and Endrick as they will hope to lead the LaLiga champions for an unprecedented sixth UEFA Super Cup honour on Wednesday in Poland.\nReal Madrid head to the game after losing two out of their last three matches against AC Milan, Barcelona and Chelsea.\nFor Atalanta, Wednesday’s UEFA Super Cup final will be their first in the history of the club.\nGian Piero Gasperini’s men finished fourth-place in the Serie A last season.\nThey currently have an injury blow in their attack line as striker, Gianluca Scamacca tore his ACL during a preseason friendly.\nScamacca will miss at least six months with the injury now putting more pressure on Lookman leading the attack for the Serie A side.\nAtalanta have made some marquee attacking signings like Charles De Ketelaere, Mateo Retegui, Ben Godfrey, Nicolo Zaniolo and Ibrahim Sulemana.\nHowever, they head to the game after losing three out of their last four matches against AZ Alkmaar, Fiorentina, Parma and FC St. Pauli.\nSpeaking with DAILY POST on Monday, Stanley Smart, a Sports Analyst, gave his view on the UEFA Super Cup final.\nHe also singled out four players to shine during the encounter.\n“Well, I expect a tough and a close match in Warsaw because it is a final,” Smart told DAILY POST.\n“Both teams did not really impress in their pre-season matches but I think if you compare the performances of the two teams during pre-season, you would agree with me that Madrid were quite better in terms of their display.\n“Having said that, I expect to see an attacking football with high intensity from both teams.\n“Both teams have sharp forwards with pace. I expect the likes of Ademola Lookman, Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius and Rodrygo to shine. It would be a proper final match,” he added.\nWhen asked to give his prediction, Smart simply said, “2-1” in favour of Madrid.\nDAILY POST reports that the kick-off time for the UEFA Super Cup final is 8 pm.",
