And it’s not over yet.\nIt all began in Rosscahill and Killannin in Galway, with Gaelic football the Fahey family staple.\nHer brothers, Gary and Richie, were part of the Tribe sides that won All-Irelands in 1998 and 2001, while Niamh followed suit herself in 2004. She was just 16 when she helped the Galway Ladies lift the Brendan Martin Cup for the first time in their history, playing the full game against Dublin at Croke Park.\nFour years later, she signed for an Arsenal team that had won the Champions League the previous season.\nFahey’s soccer origins can be traced back to Salthill Devon. She made waves locally, and helped Galway United to FAI Women’s Cup glory in 2007. As well as producing an outstanding defensive display, she scored the winning penalty to down Raheny United at Dalymount Park.\n18 months on, she won a domestic treble in her first season at Arsenal.\nSuccess aplenty followed in London, between the Gunners and cross-city rivals Chelsea, while Fahey also spent a stint in France with Bordeaux. A lifelong Liverpool fan who idolised Michael Owen as a youngster, Fahey signed for Liverpool in 2018 and she has been instrumental at the club in both the Championship and the Women’s Super League since.\nIreland was ever-present right through her colourful club forays.\nHaving climbed the underage ranks, Fahey made her senior international debut against Portugal at the Algarve Cup in 2007. She quickly became a regular in defence, and the 2009 European Championship play-offs against Iceland were the first of three such experiences in qualifying bids with mixed results.\nShe retires as the only Irish player to have featured in all three.\nThe successful one against Scotland at Hampden Park was widely referenced by 2008, 2009 and 2011 FAI International Player of the Year Fahey as a highlight on Thursday.\n“There have been countless highs and lows, but the feeling of elation and satisfaction en route to qualifying and representing our country on the world stage at the Fifa Women’s World Cup in 2023 will live long in the memory,” she wrote.\nFahey played her part in Amber Barrett’s famous winner in Glasgow, and started all three group games as Ireland’s oldest player (aged 35) at their first major tournament.\nShe flirted with retirement in the bowels of Brisbane Stadium — a series of calf injuries hampered her preparations — but opted to go again.\nThe setbacks and niggles continued, but Fahey persisted. While Áine O’Gorman, Harriet Scott and Sinéad Farrelly all bowed out, the Galway stalwart continued in pursuit of another major tournament. It wasn’t to be.\nShe walks away with countless other standout moments and memories representing Ireland, from her first and only goal on her 104th cap against Georgia in 2022 — aka ‘The Hand of Fahey’ — to Ireland’s fight for fairness at Liberty Hall in 2017.\nWhile she will continue to play for Liverpool and is dipping her toes into coaching, there’s no questioning the remarkable legacy Fahey leaves as an Irish legend.\nNí bheidh do leithéid arís ann, as they say in her parts.",
