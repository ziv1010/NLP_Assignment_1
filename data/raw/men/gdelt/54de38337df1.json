  "body_text": "At 21 years old, Thiago Almada has won a World Cup and received glowing reviews from Argentina captain Lionel Messi. And what happens next for Atlanta United’s creative midfielder could be a record-breaking transfer away from Major League Soccer.\nIn less than two full seasons in Atlanta, Almada has become a bonafide MLS star. He was recently named the league’s player of the month, which has boosted his early candidacy for the most valuable player award at year’s end. Almada has four goals and four assists in five matches this season.\n- Lionel Messi transfer live updates: Follow the latest as World Cup winners nears Inter Miami move\n- Inter Miami pushing to land Lionel Messi over Barcelona, per sources\nThe $16 million signing from Vélez Sarsfield is on track to break the reported $27 million fee that Newcastle United paid for former Atlanta No. 10 Miguel Almirón. Nonetheless, Almada’s rapid rise has had a whirlwind feel to it.\nAdvertisement\nHe was a late addition to Argentina’s 26-man World Cup roster after Nicolás González and Joaquín Correa were scratched from the list due to injury. Almada’s inclusion was a surprise, but today he’s considered an important part of Argentina’s national team future. The 30 days he spent in Argentina’s camp became an invaluable life lesson for the young player.\n“I tried to absorb everything that I could and learn from and observe the older players,” Almada said in March. “Then I had to demonstrate that on the pitch. The World Cup gave me a lot of confidence. I think I’m in good form right now and I hope to continue that way.”\nAlmada scored his first senior national team goal in a 2-0 friendly win over Panama on March 23. In just three appearances for his country, the midfielder has shown an impressive ability to play seamlessly within coach Lionel Scaloni’s versatile tactics.\nAlmada has appeared in matches that have been tilted in Argentina’s favor, which has allowed him to show his best qualities and combine well with Messi in and around the opponent’s penalty area. Those early flashes of potential earned the highest praise from one of the greatest players of all time.\n“Thiago plays loose. He’s very fast and he has a lot of 1v1 ability,” Messi said before the World Cup. “He’s very clever and he’s not afraid of anything. He’ll go at you.”\nMessi then described Almada as a player whose youthful energy and confidence was a welcome trait in Argentina’s camp. “Thiago tiene mucha frescura,” Messi said. Almada is slight at just 5 feet 7 inches tall, but his polished ball skills and close control at speed make him one of the most dynamic U-22 players in the world. He can play as an interior attacking midfielder in a three-man midfield or as a wide player with freedom to drift inside. To be frank though, Almada is a modern No. 10 — an enganche in South American footballing terms. Almada has tremendous endurance which allows him to press effectively and be deployed as a two-way player. His playmaking ability, consistent goal threat and superb set piece precision are reasons why he has become irreplaceable for Atlanta United. Almada is also essential to how Atlanta builds play from the back or when the side attacks in transition.\nHe is aware, however, that his role in elite football has diminished.\nAdvertisement\n“Honestly, every day there are less (No. 10s),” Almada told The Athletic in March. “I grew up watching (Juan Román) Riquelme and I always wanted to play like him. I try to do the things that he did and also mold myself to modern football. But I consider myself a No. 10. Riquelme is my one and only idol. I was lucky enough to meet him. He was Argentine football’s last enganche.”\nAlmada has a particular player profile and probable price tag that could limit the number of European suitors that Atlanta United will have. Yet, the club is confident that Almada will soon be playing at a significantly higher level.\n“He’s a good pro,” said Atlanta United technical director Carlos Bocanegra in October. “He loves the game. And so at some point we know he will be going over to Europe and playing Champions League football. We’re really excited about that.”\nThat begs a few questions: Which European league is best for Almada? And what Champions League-level club would be interested in a player like the young Argentine?\nThe Premier League\nThe world’s best football league is also the world’s richest. Several Premier League clubs wouldn’t have a problem with the value that Atlanta United places on Almada. Thus, there’s a very good chance that one or more teams could be interested. If Atlanta United and Almada’s camp are targeting Champions League clubs, well, that narrows it down even more.\nManchester City’s wealth makes them an obvious choice here. To begin, the club is familiar with Almada. City reportedly bid for him in 2020. Additionally, manager Pep Guardiola’s recent admiration for young Argentine attackers is notable. Almada’s Argentina teammate Julian Alvarez was signed in January 2022 from River Plate for a reported fee of $17 million. He has since starred for Argentina at the World Cup (scoring four goals) and recently signed a contract extension with City through 2028.\nAdvertisement\nCity’s latest Argentine import, like Almada, is a product of Vélez Sarsfield’s youth academy. Maximo Perrone, a left-footed central midfielder, joined Guardiola’s side this past winter. Perhaps recent contacts with Velez, and Guardiola’s approval of the quality that they’ve produced, will put Almada on the manager’s radar. City is a loaded squad, especially in midfield, but that hasn’t stopped their ownership from spending big on new signings.\nAnd why not Manchester United? If wooing FC Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong is now a lost cause, a ball progressor like Almada could be an alternative. Erik ten Hag’s side would also benefit from having more speed in midfield. United was previously linked to Almada before he went to MLS, but South Americans don’t always flourish in Manchester red.\nBoth Chelsea and Arsenal have been linked to Almada’s Argentina teammate Alexis Mac Allister. Money wouldn’t be an issue for Chelsea if Almada is of interest, but the Blues just fired manager Graham Potter and they have a mountain to climb to get back into the Champions League qualification. Arsenal is top of the table and Almada would be a cheaper option than Brighton’s Mac Allister, whose stock is similarly high at the moment.\nThat leaves Liverpool, Newcastle United, and Tottenham. Spurs are in disarray, while the Reds continue to battle for a top-four spot. Liverpool will likely rebuild their squad this summer, which could open the door to a surprise swoop for Almada. Meanwhile, Newcastle United has a history of dealing with Atlanta United. Almirón’s sale made MLS history and the man behind the deal was Darren Eales, the former president of Atlanta United who’s now chief executive officer of Newcastle.\nEales and Atlanta United’s new CEO Garth Lagerwey were teammates over 20 years ago in America’s lower division football leagues. What a story that would be if Newcastle were to make another record-breaking bid for an Atlanta United player.\nLa Liga\nLet’s keep this one short. La Liga president Javier Tebas said one month ago that it is “impossible” for Barcelona to sign new players, as the Catalan club is currently mired in a financial crisis. So Almada won’t be a target, but if it were possible, he would be an intriguing addition to the Xavi Hernández project at Barcelona.\nAlmada’s agent Agustin Jimenez has helped place Argentines Rodrigo De Paul and Ángel Correa at Atletico Madrid. The Colchoneros front office would be wise to add needed pace and goals to Diego Simeone’s midfield. And Atleti, like Manchester United, has been tracking Almada since he was a teenager.\nWow, just wow.\nTake a bow, Thiago Almada! ✨ pic.twitter.com/UcF5fXJeUE\n— Major League Soccer (@MLS) March 19, 2023\nFinally, there’s Real Madrid. Change is coming to the 14-time Champions League winners. To begin with, head coach Carlo Ancelotti is the favorite to take the open Brazil national team job. Plus, a purposeful transfer strategy to make Real Madrid younger has already begun. A new-look midfield of Aurélien Tchouaméni, Eduardo Camavinga and Thiago Almada would double down on that intent.\nAdvertisement\nSerie A\nItalian clubs are on the rise in Europe. AC Milan, Internazionale and Napoli have all qualified for the Champions League quarterfinals. Runaway Serie A leaders Napoli are playing the best brand of football in the world with an exciting and direct style of play that would suit Almada.\nIf Napoli sells Victor Osimhen in the summer and moves on from Mexican winger Hirving Lozano (who became Napoli’s most expensive signing ever at $46 million), Almada could be part of a refreshed attack at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. AC Milan, which trounced Napoli 4-0 on Sunday, has gone much younger under Stefano Pioli and has recruited well of late.\nTactically, Inter Milan’s 3-5-2 under Simone Inzaghi would fit a line-breaking dribbler like Almada. And Juventus? The Old Lady has their own Argentina youth international and former Vélez product in 19-year-old Matias Soulé. Could they add another in Almada?\nThe dark horses\nPortugal’s Primeira Liga has always been a hotbed for young talent. FC Porto and Benfica, in particular, have been home to some of the world’s best players. Portugal can be a momentary stop for promising players before they land in a top-five league.\nPorto and Benfica, perennial Champions League participants, have recently sold Luis Diaz and Enzo Fernandez for significant transfer fees. The Colombian Diaz was acquired by Liverpool for close to $60 million, while Chelsea added Argentine holding midfielder Fernandez from Benfica for a Premier League transfer record of $131 million. Both clubs clearly have cash to spend.\nThe league’s style of football is ideal for Almada. The matches are fast and aesthetically attractive due to the abundance of skillful players. Almada could adjust to life in Europe with less pressure and play his way toward a higher-profile league.\nThe Dutch Eredivisie is ideal for young stars, too. But if Ajax wanted to sign Almada, for instance, he would certainly become the most expensive player in Eredivisie history. That title is currently held by former Tottenham attacker Steven Bergwijn, who joined Ajax from Spurs for over $30 million.\nAdvertisement\nAnd then there’s the Bundesliga. German clubs continue to scout MLS for young players, typically American footballers. Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund are obvious contenders here. Both teams invest in young players and would provide a high level of football for Almada, but would Germany appeal to him if the Premier League or a top-of-the-table La Liga side are alternatives?\nAlmada’s move to Europe is inevitable. His skill is undeniable, while his strengths and his flaws make him a fascinating prospect. Whether he leaves Atlanta United in the upcoming summer or winter windows is uncertain, but unequivocally, Almada will soon bid farewell to his American excursion.\nGraphics by Jeff Rueter.\n(Photo: Rich von Biberstein/Getty Images)",
