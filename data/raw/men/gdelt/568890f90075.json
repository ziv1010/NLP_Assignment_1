He will want an instant return on his hefty investment at Stamford Bridge while Tottenham, back in the Champions League, will want to kick on once more too.\nIt's not all about the action at the top though with Fulham, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest promoted to the top tier for 2021/22 and hoping to hold their own against the best English football has to offer and avoid the drop.\nWe will bring you all the action and updates from today's game in the live blog below:\nFulham vs Manchester City LIVE: Premier League updates\nFUL XI - Leno, Tete, Ream, Tosin, Robinson, Reed, Palhinha, Andreas, De Cordova-Reid, Vinicius, Wilson\nMCI XI - Ederson, Walker, Stones, Dias, Akanji, Rodri, Gundogan, Mahrez, Grealish, Alvarez, Haaland\nGoal - Haaland buries a penalty for his 50th of the season (0-1)\nGoal - Vinicius equalises after Wilson’s knock-down (1-1)\nGoal - Alvarez curls in a top-corner finish (1-2)\nFulham FC 1 - 2 Manchester City FC\nFulham vs Manchester City\n16:09\nTruly a match-winning performance! 🤩@julianalvarezzz 🪄\n⚪️ 1-2 ⚫️ #ManCity | @EASPORTSFIFA pic.twitter.com/j0Uz2mdNiY— Manchester City (@ManCity) April 30, 2023\nFulham vs Manchester City\n16:05\nFULL-TIME: FULHAM 1-2 MANCHESTER CITY\nFulham vs Manchester City\n16:05\nRejoin our Matchday Live studio guests for all of the reaction to that win as we head to the top of the Premier League! 💪 https://t.co/L2YvewRTTV\n— Manchester City (@ManCity) April 30, 2023\nFulham vs Manchester City\n16:05\nCity force Robinson into conceding one last corner down their right.

He's on a yellow card.\nFulham vs Manchester City\n15:59\nThere's no way City are going to let Fulham score again now. Guardiola's men don't look flustered at all.\nFulham vs Manchester City\n15:56\nFulham aren't particularly threatening to score an equaliser now. City are successfully holding them at arm's length.\nFulham vs Manchester City\n15:55\nSilva's the latest City player to earn a free-kick as he gets a rise out of Tete. There'll be at least eight added minutes after Pereira's unfortunate injury earlier.\nFulham vs Manchester City\n15:54\nEIGHT minutes added...\n— Fulham Football Club (@FulhamFC) April 30, 2023\nFulham vs Manchester City\n15:54\n89.

A stretcher's been brought onto the pitch. This looks bad. Meanwhile, Fulham are preparing to make a substitution.\nFulham vs Manchester City\n15:20\nAkanji takes a whack in an aerial battle, leaving him down in Fulham's half. City's players look concerned. The medical team rush on to check him out.\nFulham vs Manchester City\n15:17\nCity's corner comes to nothing, but that won't deter them. Alvarez's cross from the right gets cleared.\nFulham vs Manchester City\n15:16\nFulham are pressing higher up the pitch, making it harder for City to play out from the back. It's a little end-to-end, and Alvarez gets loose to force Leno into another stop at his near post. City corner.\nFulham vs Manchester City\n15:13\nFulham clear the resulting City corner. If Silva's men want to get anything out of this game, they can't afford to concede the next goal.\nFulham vs Manchester City\n15:12\n48.

Only Haaland and De Bruyne have been involved in more goals away for home for City this season than the England winger. He's become one of their main men.\nFulham vs Manchester City\n14:59\nKeep it going! 💪 https://t.co/hJ1OlgddcQ\n— Manchester City (@ManCity) April 30, 2023\nFulham vs Manchester City\n14:57\nCity go at half-time with a slender lead thanks to Alvarez's sumptuous strike. The champions have played well overall so far without hitting the heights we all know they can. Fulham will be buoyed by Vinicius' goal though. They're still in this game, without a doubt.

City haven't been perfect in this first half.\nFulham vs Manchester City\n14:44\nGundogan slips into the penalty area and shoots from the right of the six-yard box.
