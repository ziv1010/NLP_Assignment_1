  "body_text": "Tottenham Hotspur are locked in a state of limbo, two days on from Antonio Conte publicly torching his relationship with the squad.\nIt has been a quiet 48 hours at the club’s training ground in the north London suburb of Enfield. The players were all given Sunday and Monday off, as is normal at the start of an international break. And Conte is back at home in Italy, where he tends to go at the start of one of these windows.\nAdvertisement\nOnly on Tuesday will players start to return to work and even then it will only be those not playing any international football over the next week or so: the likes of Lucas Moura, Clement Lenglet, Japhet Tanganga, Arnaut Danjuma, Alfie Whiteman, Brandon Austin and Ryan Sessegnon. Hugo Lloris will train as he prepares to return to action following two months out with a knee injury. Richarlison and Ben Davies, who have both pulled out of international duty, will be in for treatment at some point this week.\nBut behind the scenes, Daniel Levy and Fabio Paratici — Conte’s last ally left at the club — are left mulling over the question that has been unavoidable since Conte’s comments on Saturday evening: whether it is time to sack him and complete this season with someone else in the dugout.\nWhen Conte ended his press conference at the St Mary’s Stadium following the 3-3 away draw with Southampton, it felt like he had made continuing as Spurs head coach completely untenable. He had just destroyed his players in public in a way that was unprecedented in modern football. He had undermined any possibility of a strong finish to the season to secure fourth place and the Champions League spot for 2023-24 that goes with it. He had dragged the name of the club who employ him through the mud. He had made it almost impossible for chairman Levy to keep him on.\nBut there was no sign yesterday of the ‘club announcement’ statement so many fans Tottenham were waiting for. And this morning (Monday) there was no sign of it either. Conte remains in place as head coach.\nAt first, it felt like a surprise that he should be able to survive this.\nHe could hardly have made it more obvious he does not rate his own chances of motivating the players over the final stretch of the season to achieve the only goal left to them. Yet Tottenham, despite recent disappointments in the cups at home and abroad, still have something important to play for in their 10 remaining league games. Given how valuable Champions League qualification is to the club, surely they would want to act to preserve that?\nBut just because Conte has made it through Sunday and (so far) Monday, it does not mean that his job is necessarily safe. His situation remains up in the air even now.\nAdvertisement\nYes, in the past, Spurs have made a habit of announcing the departure of managers on the Monday morning after a difficult weekend. The sackings of Nuno Espirito Santo, Jose Mourinho and Andre Villas-Boas were all announced at the start of the working week (the latest of those three, Villas-Boas, was announced by 11:03am on that particular Monday). When Conte made it through to lunchtime today, it felt to some that he was secure.\nBut all three of those dismissals took place during a routine part of the season, when fixtures came thick and fast. When Mourinho was sacked, Spurs had a league game at home to Southampton on the Wednesday to prepare for and then a Carabao Cup final against Manchester City at the weekend. Interim appointment Ryan Mason did not have a minute to spare in terms of preparing the players for the last few crucial games.\nThis is different. Spurs’ next game is still two weeks away — they go to Everton on Monday, April 3. There is plenty of time left in this window for Levy and Paratici to decide whether Conte can continue or not. And remember that when Levy sacked Mauricio Pochettino to replace him with Mourinho, it was not announced until the Tuesday of the second week of an international break, 10 days after the Argentinian’s last game in charge.\nGiven how few of the first-team squad are training this week, there is less pressure on the club to take an imminent decision. They will not start filtering back to Hotspur Way until the start of next week. If Conte stays, that is when he would have to face the players he threw under the bus on Saturday.\nHis comments have gone down as badly as anyone would expect with the players, ending any doubt about whether he has lost the dressing room. If Spurs finishing fourth with Conte felt unlikely after they threw away a 3-1 lead with 15 minutes of normal time to go at St Mary’s, it is far less likely now.\nAdvertisement\nBut because the return of the majority of the squad won’t happen for another week, that gives Levy and Paratici the luxury of all that time to make up their minds, should they need it.\nIf Levy decides to do what he did two years ago and hand the reins over to assistant coach Mason for the rest of the season, the important thing would be to give him most of next week with the whole squad, rather than this one with the handful of players who’ll be about.\nAnd if Levy thinks that now is the time to draw a line under the Conte era and go forward with Mason, there is of course the matter of terminating the Italian’s contract. He has just over three months left on the deal he signed when he was appointed in November 2021, which would entitle him to roughly £4million ($4.9m) in the event of his dismissal.\nEven though things have been quiet since Saturday evening, they could still move fast from here. The ball is still in Levy’s court.\n(Top photo: Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty Images)",
