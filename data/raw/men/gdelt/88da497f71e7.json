  "body_text": "The international break will have felt strangely familiar — and maybe even a little cathartic — for Rodrygo.\nDovetailing nicely with Vinicius Junior down the left flank, with Carlo Ancelotti prowling the touchline, just like old times, his two starts for Brazil across the last seven days were the most encouraging performances we have seen from the 24-year-old in quite some time.\nAdvertisement\nAlarmingly, 284 minutes across four friendlies for the national team this season accounts for close to half of Rodrygo’s gametime, while two goals against South Korea in October — more than 10,000 kilometres away from where he plays his club football in Madrid — are the only occasions on which he has found the net. With new head coach Xabi Alonso favouring a little more balance at the top of the team than his predecessor Ancelotti, primarily opting for only Vinicius Jr and Kylian Mbappe in the all-out attack roles, opportunities for other wingers have been limited.\nAs we can see from the visualisation below, Rodrygo has not played this infrequently since he joined the club as a fresh-faced teenager seven seasons ago.\nThere are other important factors behind a sharp decrease in playing time. Rodrygo revealed, in an interview with Spanish news outlet AS in October, that he suffered with personal issues towards the end of last season, speaking of physical and mental troubles that a packed footballing schedule would not have allowed the winger time and space to work through.\n“He (Ancelotti) saw every day that I wasn’t well, that I wasn’t fit to play or able to help the team,” said Rodrygo. “He understood my situation and how complicated it was. He told me, ‘stay here and take it easy’. He knew he had to help me recover as a person before helping me recover as a player.”\nThankfully, Rodrygo assured AS he is through the worst of his problems: “It was a very difficult time in my life, but now I’ve overcome everything, I’m OK. Now I just feel joy, I’m happy, very motivated to have a great season.”\nBut now the stumbling block is tactical, with the player holding firm in his desire to play out on the left. Rodrygo did start on that flank as the season commenced, as Alonso made the bold decision to bench Vinicius Jr against Real Oviedo and Marseille in the early weeks of his tenure. Despite that initial show of faith in Rodrygo, the consistent impact of his good friend and international team-mate has seen him shifted to the opposite side — or out of the team completely — to make way.\nAdvertisement\nRodrygo’s talent, and his instinctive connection with Vinicius Jr when the pair share the left wing, are undeniable. Against Senegal and Tunisia this week, he racked up nine shots, created four chances and laid on an assist, taking it in turns with Vinicius Jr to drift inside and drive down the flank with purpose. But there is still the small matter of displacing Mbappe — arguably the best player in the world right now — for that same spot at club level.\n“I can’t do much,” he told reporters after the Tunisia draw, “I have to keep working, putting the effort in and try to gain the confidence of the coach, just like I have with the national team.”\nThe question now is: could Alonso be swayed by Rodrygo’s dynamism on the international stage?\nRodrygo’s discontent with his positioning is nothing new, and looks the biggest sticking point to his reintegration into the team.\nEver since the arrival of Mbappe in the summer of 2024, the Brazilian has felt the most likely to be sacrificed to fit an all-star attack and Jude Bellingham into the same starting XI, all while maintaining a defensive balance.\nAnd while Ancelotti tried his best, starting all four on 15 occasions in La Liga and the Champions League last season, tactical issues began to unfold. A 4-4-2 out-of-possession shape often saw Bellingham and Rodrygo defending the wide spaces, taking the former away from his strongest area of the pitch and leaving the latter out to dry defensively against stronger teams.\nEarlier in his Madrid career, as we can see from the visualisation below, Rodrygo did play more frequently on the right-hand side, supporting Karim Benzema in a traditional 4-3-3 and sharing the minutes with Marco Asensio as he looked to establish himself with the first team.\nIn 2022-23 and 2023-24, he would regularly rotate with Vinicius from a ‘split-striker’ role, enjoying the positional freedom of Ancelotti’s system as both Brazilian wingers played at the top of a 4-4-2, encouraged to drift into wide spaces to allow Bellingham’s box-crashing runs through the middle.\nAdvertisement\nBut, as we can see from last season’s touchmap, Mbappe’s signing largely consigned Rodrygo to a role back out on the right.\nFrom his own perspective, Rodrygo’s preference for the left is understandable.\nAs reported by The Athletic, he told Alonso in their early conversations that he wanted to play on that side, where he finds it more comfortable to cut inside onto his stronger foot. He is often more lively over there, with the data revealing that he takes more shots, provides more chances for team-mates and attempts significantly more take-ons (4.2 vs 7.4 per 90) from a left-sided role.\nThe graphic below uses combined non-penalty expected goals (npxG) and expected assists (xA) to quantify the danger that Rodrygo brings through shots on goal and creative play, illustrating that he is less involved in front of goal when he is moved out to the right.\nEven in limited gametime, Rodrygo’s cameos under Alonso have been lively, if not totally effective. Although he has yet to score, only Mbappe has been involved in more sequences leading to shots on a per-game basis this season.\nA low sample size means we should take that statistic with a pinch of salt, with many of his minutes falling towards the end of games against tired legs and low blocks, but it does point to a player at least trying to make an impact.\nHere he is against Oviedo in Madrid’s second La Liga match of the season, receiving the ball out wide and darting around the first challenge, before weaving his way into the penalty area and seeing his shot blocked.\nA start against Getafe also gave Rodrygo an opportunity from the left, but up against one of La Liga’s most rigorously organised defensive sides, he struggled to make an impact despite a series of meandering runs and hopeful crosses into the box.\nThe brutal reality at this level, with the team increasingly reliant on Mbappe for moments of attacking inspiration, is that is not nearly enough. While Rodrygo is explosive and inventive on his day, he cannot replicate the consistent incision of Vinicius Jr’s direct dribbling, and is yet to prove he can reach the ceiling of his team-mate’s attacking output — Vinicius Jr has reached the 20-goal mark in four separate seasons for Madrid, while Rodrygo’s highest is 19 in 2022-23.\nAdvertisement\nRodrygo’s personal preference for the left is understandable, but so is Alonso’s inclination towards Vinicius Jr, given his search for team-wide structure and balance makes it difficult to include both.\nAny path back into Alonso’s long-term plans will have to include compromise, and, unfortunately for Rodrygo, he will likely be looking at a familiar second prize.\n“Yes, yes, it’s a possibility,” said Alonso earlier this month, when asked about Rodrygo’s suitability on the right. “He can play on both wings, in fact he’s done it a lot, even in the centre.”\nThe Athletic has also previously revealed that the club, along with Alonso, have agreed that if a fair offer came in, neither would oppose Rodrygo’s exit. Barring a major change, either he is second choice on the left, unhappy on the right, or is sold, although sources close to the club (who asked to remain anonymous to protect their positions) admit a departure in January is highly unlikely.\nAt this point, it is important to remember Rodrygo’s contributions to the club over the years. From his debut goal against Osasuna, 93 seconds after coming off the bench, when the Madrid shirt was a little baggier on his back, to an unforgettable late double to secure a 6-5 aggregate win against Manchester City in the Champions League semi-final in 2022.\nThis is an immensely talented player, who would have few problems breaking into any side in world football. Only at Madrid are there two of the most impactful left-sided forwards in the game standing in his way.",
