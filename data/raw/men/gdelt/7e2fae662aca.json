  "body_text": "“By practising,” Mikel Arteta answered. This was November 2023, and he had been asked how his side could beat low blocks.\nArsenal have had plenty of practice against such deep-lying defences since then. Their manager Arteta, speaking back then at his pre-match press conference for a Champions League match against French side Lens, was discussing “finding the right key to unlock the doors” — something Arsenal struggled with last season. They drew too many games (14 of the 38 in the Premier League, as they finished second for a third year running), had too many injuries and did not score enough goals (69, compared to champions Liverpool with 86).\nAdvertisement\nEleven league matches into 2025-26, things are looking much rosier for them: top with a four-point gap, boasting the third-best attack based on goals scored (behind Manchester City and Chelsea), and showing evidence of squad depth, with a perfect record after four of their eight matches in the league phase of the Champions League, and progress to the last eight in the Carabao Cup.\nAnd while Arteta’s team are built on a record-breaking defence, the “key to unlock the doors” has been found in attack: through balls.\nArsenal are the top Premier League team for through balls this season. North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, coincidentally, are bottom of the pile for one of football’s most aesthetically pleasing aspects.\nFor Arsenal, this is a significant improvement on last season, when their through balls dropped by around one-quarter from the 2023-24 number.\nThey are attempting nearly four through balls per game, their most under Arteta since the start of 2021-22 and the best rate by any Premier League team since Chelsea under Maurizio Sarri in 2018-19.\nThese can be broadly categorised into four types within a tactical Venn diagram — with some overlap, of course.\nThe early through ball\nAs Arsenal and summer-signing striker Viktor Gyokeres adapt to each other, this pass type has become increasingly prevalent, with Arteta’s men trying to exploit opponents in a mid-block before they can drop low.\nSweden international Gyokeres, who cost an initial £55million ($72m) from Sporting CP of Lisbon, is a channel-running No 9 who thrives against high lines.\nThis is why Arsenal have started playing more first-time diagonal passes from the right wing, when opponents are in a settled defensive block and have left space.\nSimilarly, left-back Riccardo Calafiori, from a half-space position, released Gyokeres to score the third goal — where he cut in from the wing — in the 5-0 home win against Leeds United back in August.\n“He makes us a much better team. We’ve become much more unpredictable,” Arteta told reporters when asked about Gyokeres after October’s 4-0 defeat of visitors Atletico Madrid in the Champions League. “He’s so physical, opens the spaces for everyone.”\nAdvertisement\nThis directness suits the pace of Arsenal’s wide players too. For instance, here is midfielder Eberechi Eze dropping deep against a compact Atletico mid-block, and threading a pass between their left-back and centre-back to put right-winger Bukayo Saka into a shooting position.\nThey played two passes over the defence in the space of 10 seconds away to Slavia Prague in the Champions League last week, too — a game Arsenal won 3-0.\nFirst, Gabriel chipped in behind for left-winger Leandro Trossard. When the Belgian lost that duel, Slavia cleared the ball upfield, only for Declan Rice to pick up the second ball. He immediately curled a pass inside the left-back in search of Saka, who had a shot saved.\nThere was another Calafiori long pass, this time for Eze, to send him through and assist Gyokeres in the home win over Nottingham Forest in September. The pick of the bunch though, given the significance of the game, has to be Eze’s pass for Gabriel Martinelli at home to Manchester City the following weekend.\nThe half-space slip\nThis is about Arsenal’s wide combinations, in particular on the right. Midfielder Martin Odegaard, as a left-footer, is predisposed to diagonal passes past an opposition full-back — especially for Saka.\nHere’s that pattern in the 2-0 home win over West Ham United from October, when Odegaard rotates wide. Saka opts to play the cutback and, somehow, neither Gyokeres nor Eze can convert.\nLater in that game, two different Arsenal players combine — for the same move — to open the scoring. West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta has come out to the touchline defending Saka, leaving Martin Zubimendi free in midfield.\nThis time, it is Eze’s half-space run, past Mateus Fernandes, who is square to the ball, onto Zubimendi’s through ball.\nAlphonse Areola parries Eze’s shot but Rice, the deepest of the three Arsenal midfielders, follows up to score on the rebound — just as Martinelli did at home against Atletico (from Gyokeres’ shot) and Saka in the Carabao Cup win over Brighton & Hove Albion (from Andre Harriman-Annous’ effort) last month.\nZone 14 triangles\nThe Arsene Wenger-style move. These tend to be less rehearsed patterns and more off-the-cuff combinations, when Arsenal quickly connect in central spaces just outside the opponents’ penalty area (the part of the pitch known as ‘zone 14’ in tactics circles).\nAdvertisement\nSome element of individual brilliance is needed here, because they are incisive attacks that cut down a low block.\nArsenal have used these much less in the Premier League this season — their average goal-ending sequence is down from being 3.5 passes and 12 seconds long last term to 2.0 and six.\nHere’s a rare example, where right-back Jurrien Timber (albeit he’s probably offside) becomes an extra forward in the box, giving Arsenal a four-v-three overload, and running off the back of Newcastle centre-half Sven Botman to head a chance at goal.\nIn the Carabao Cup, though, they have broken down Port Vale and Brighton to score opening goals from such patterns.\nMikel Merino was decisive in both those goals. “You can always have options if you invent them,” Arteta said of playing the Spain international, nominally a midfielder, at central striker, before the Slavia win.\nIt was his nutmeg pass, on the half-turn, that set up Eze at Port Vale, and his backheel for Myles Lewis-Skelly against Brighton (Lewis-Skelly then squared the ball for Ethan Nwaneri to sweep in a far-post finish) that unlocked the defence.\nThe quick turnaround\nThese, while less common than the other three patterns, are a key way Arsenal can turn teams around from their own goal kicks.\nAbout half of opposition goal kicks are sent long (40-plus yards) when playing Arsenal. That eight more teams face a higher rate speaks to the increased directness in the Premier League this season — noticeably versus Liverpool — and is another way Arteta’s side can exploit opponents.\nThis was how Martinelli opened the scoring in their 2-0 away Champions League win over Athletic Club in September, 36 seconds after coming off the bench with 20 minutes of the 90 to play.\nCristhian Mosquera headed the launched goal kick back towards the Athletic goal, and Rice glanced a flick-on in Trossard’s direction. The Belgium international hooked a pass over three red and white shirts to send Martinelli through, and he got away from the nearest defender with his pace, before slotting a finish past Unai Simon.\nInstant impact!\nMartinelli gives Arsenal the lead 36 seconds after coming off the bench against Athletic Club ⚡️ pic.twitter.com/ViyE1nLSbK\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) September 16, 2025\nHere’s a similar move from the win away to Burnley at the start of November.\nZubimendi wins the aerial duel, and his header goes straight to Gyokeres — Saka is already on the move before the ball reaches the Swede, who slots the England winger through. In a one-on-one, Saka shoots straight at Martin Dubravka.\nThe next challenge for Arsenal, when the club season resumes after this two-week international window, will be to break down a solid Tottenham side who are unbeaten away from home in the league so far (four wins, one draw).\nAdvertisement\nBrentford, under Spurs’ new head coach Thomas Frank, often proved a tough nut for Arsenal to crack, at the Emirates especially.\nHis green shoots at Tottenham have been improving them out of possession.\nArteta’s side have proven they’ve found the keys, but this door may be an extra-stubborn one to unlock.",
