The Merseysiders are already into the final of the Carabao Cup due to be played next month.\nAdd to that finishing top of the Champions League group-stage table and leading the way in the Premier League, and it's all been pretty plain sailing for the former Feyenoord boss so far.\nWho did Liverpool manager Arne Slot try to get rid of in January?\nLiverpool's attack has been heavily reliant on the attacking output seen by Mohamed Salah so far. The Egyptian - ranked at No.1 in FourFourTwo's list of the best Premier League wingers of all time - has a whopping 44 goal contributions this season.\nAdd to that Cody Gakpo's knack for finding the back of the net at the right time, it has meant Slot has often been forced into some very difficult decisions regarding his team selection.\nIt is the future of another Reds forward that has been widely discussed in recent days, with Fabrizio Romano admitting Liverpool turned down a late offer from Al-Nassr from Uruguyuan striker Darwin Nunez.\nNunez, 25, has just six goals to his name this term and is often a player who divides opinion. The former Benfica man was said to be 'close' to heading to the Middle East before Slot concluded it left the club no time to find a replacement.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\n► How to watch Everton vs Liverpool\nAl-Nassr are said to have held three rounds of direct talks with the player and his representatives, but a final agreement on a proposed move was not reached.\nNunez was said to be open to leaving Anfield given the riches Saudi football can bring. Additional reports have also suggested Slot will allow Nunez the chance to leave the club in the summer.\nIn FourFourTwo's view, it looks increasingly likely that Nunez will leave Merseyside in 2025 as he just doesn't look like the type of striker to fit Slot's system.\nLiverpool are back in action in the Premier League on Wednesday evening, as they take on Everton at Goodison Park.\nMatthew Holt writes freelance for FourFourTwo, amongst others, and boasts previous experience at GOAL and SPORTBible.
