  "body_text": "Last summer, John Heitinga faced the most important decision of his coaching career so far.\nHeitinga is an Ajax man. Having graduated from the academy in 2001, he made 152 league appearances for the first team and won two league titles before leaving for Atletico Madrid in 2008. His footballing ideas were inherently shaped by the club, and he began his coaching career with their youth teams before serving as an interim head coach in 2023. And after a couple of years away serving as an assistant under David Moyes at West Ham United and Arne Slot at Liverpool, he was offered the opportunity to return to the top job in May last year.\nAdvertisement\nHaving made an outstanding contribution to Liverpool’s title-winning side, Slot was keen to keep him around for another year. Asked in a press conference about the prospect of Heitinga leaving for Ajax, Slot said they “would be smart” to consider him, but added, “If John is smart, he would stay one more season.”\nRob Jansen, Heitinga’s agent, recently told Dutch outlet De Telegraaf that he initially warned his client against the Ajax job, describing it as a “nearly impossible task, because the misery is so deeply ingrained in that club that no one could have performed.”\nWhile they remain the undisputed giants of Dutch football, Ajax are not the force they once were. They have not won the Eredivisie since the 2021-22 season, which is also the last time they reached the Champions League knockout stages. Last season, they had a great chance to retake the Dutch crown, leading second-placed PSV by nine points with four games remaining, but collapsed in the final weeks, surrendering that lead to finish second.\nWhen Heitinga agreed to replace Francesco Farioli in late May 2025, he was not just tasked with returning Ajax to the top of Dutch football, but restoring their footballing identity. Under Farioli, Ajax were more pragmatic and long-ball-oriented. Some in Amsterdam argued he was making the most out of a technically limited squad; others insisted Ajax should never stray from their attacking principles.\nIn hindsight, it proved to be a move neither side was ready for. Heitinga was dismissed as head coach in November, with Ajax sitting pointless at the bottom of the Champions League table after four matches and eight points adrift of Eredivisie league-leaders Feyenoord. Now, he has returned to the Premier League as an assistant coach in Thomas Frank’s staff at Tottenham Hotspur, where the challenge is no less significant.\nAdvertisement\nHeitinga has replaced Matt Wells, who left Frank’s staff to take the head coach job at MLS side Colorado Rapids in late December, and is positioned alongside Justin Cochrane and Andreas Georgson as one of three primary first-team coaches. Frank delegates training-ground roles to each of his assistants, and Heitinga, a career centre-back, has inherited Wells’ role as the defensive lead (Cochrane leads the attacking sessions and Georgson is in charge of set pieces).\nWhile issues with attacking fluency and chance creation have been the primary frustration for supporters under Frank, questions over the defensive structure remain from Ange Postecoglou’s tenure. Tottenham concede a high number of goals from outside the box under Frank, despite typically deploying two defensive midfielders in front of an accomplished back line, and remain vulnerable to quick transitions when they lose possession.\nPart of football is give-and-take, and elite sides tend to control the ball at the expense of solidity, but Frank’s side is yet to hit the mark in either department. Heitinga, who combines defensive nous with an appreciation for attacking football, may prove key as Frank’s side aims to improve on both ends.\n“He’s been a great addition,” Kevin Danso said after Tottenham’s 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday. “He’s got great experience, as everyone knows, and he’s keeping us on board; it’s exactly what we need.”\nHeitinga may not yet have all the tools to manage a club of Ajax’s size, but he is an exceptionally highly rated training-ground coach and talent developer, and played an important role in the development of Ajax centre-back Youri Baas.\nBaas, 22, was first trialled at centre-back by Farioli, having previously played at left-back and left-wing as a professional, but went to another level under Heitinga’s guidance. Heitinga and Baas had multiple individual sessions, where Heitinga worked to enhance Baas’ tactical understanding. They discussed how every touch and movement he makes has a broader impact on the unit.\nHeitinga explained how playing passes at a certain angle causes the unit and the opposition to adjust accordingly, emphasising the importance of intentionality and execution in every action. He can explain complex tactical plans and how to hurt other teams using patterns and structures to players in a digestible manner.\nAdvertisement\nIn the pre-match press conference ahead of the 2-1 third-round FA Cup defeat to Aston Villa, Frank said: “One-to-one interaction with players is one of John’s key strengths. He is very good at connecting. He’s very good and direct.“\nJarell Quansah, who worked with Heitinga at Liverpool before joining Bayer Leverkusen last summer, also cited the Dutchman’s ability to connect with players and improve tactical understanding in an interview with reporters. “I can always lean into him. He was an established centre-back who had a great career, so I can always pick his head.\n“He often comes to me, too. Maybe I am trying to do stuff by myself, but he will come to me and show me clips, help me find a positive mindset for any game I play in.”\nAnd it’s not just in defence where Heitinga will hope to leave his mark. He was pivotal in Ryan Gravenberch’s development into a holding midfielder, with Heitinga helping his countryman understand the role through clear, concise instructions. Gravenberch, who worked under Heitinga at Ajax’s academy, was considered an elite midfield talent without a defined role under Jurgen Klopp. But as part of Slot’s staff, Heitinga moulded him into a No 6 with the ability to contribute to the team’s attacking and defensive flow.\nWith a young, exciting core of midfielders including Archie Gray, Lucas Bergvall, and Pape Matar Sarr, Heitinga’s expertise will surely be called on again. Should Heitinga help one or more of that enormously promising group reach their potential, his appointment will likely go down as a success.\nBut the immediate focus is on improving Spurs’ results in the league. After an encouraging display in the 2-0 win against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday, fans are keen to see a similar performance against Burnley today.\nAnd, as a firm believer in the old Ajax principles, Heitinga could prove an important voice in helping Frank deliver a style of play Spurs fans are proud of.",
