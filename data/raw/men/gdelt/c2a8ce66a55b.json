With 11 wins in his first 12 games, including 6 away wins, Liverpool FC are flying, top of the table in the English Premier League and joint-top in the UEFA Champions League.\nSlot Talk: “You Thought We Didn’t Dominate?”\nThe boss was bemused by a line of questioning after the Leipzig game.\nAhead of a big game away at the Emirates against Arsenal on Sunday and on the road against a fellow Pot 1 team in Leipzig, Liverpool took care of business with a 1-0 win.\nSpeaking at the post-match press conference, Slot addressed the close margin of the scoreline:\n“Yeah. I don’t think we started the game really well in the first 10 or 15 minutes, but after that I liked a lot what I saw. Many, many, many times we played through their press, opened up their midfield and went for an attack. That led to the first goal, that led to a few chances – more than a few and then in the end it’s a pity that you still need your two centre-backs to play such a big game and your goalkeeper to make two such important saves because a game like this should have been ours after 60, 70 minutes and it wasn’t. That’s why the last 20 were still difficult for us.”\nHowever, when asked if he was concerned that Liverpool did not “dominate” the game, our head coach offered up a rather bemused response:\n“You were not inside the stadium? You thought we didn’t dominate? If you play good teams and if you play a pot one team in an away game, there will always be moments in the game that the other team has some moments as well and I think one of them was from a corner kick. The way I looked at this game was that we had, for large parts of the game, total dominance like in all the other games we played except for the one against Chelsea.\nSo, I am not worried at all about this game, I was a bit more worried, if you want to call it like this, after the Chelsea game. But this is how I like to see our team play: much more chances than the other team, much more ball possession, much more time freeing up the midfield from build-up. So, that was good but I agree with you that if you were only there for the first 10 and the last 20 [minutes] that there were also difficult phases in the game. But that, at this level, is what happens in football.”\nIt’s still early days in this brutal stretch for Liverpool that’ll last all the way through November, but Liverpool seem to be just fine. On to the big one this weekend.",
