  "body_text": "Mohamed Salah has ended months of speculation by signing a new contract that will keep him at Liverpool until 2027. The Egyptian forward, whose previous deal was due to expire this summer, has chosen to stay at Anfield, with the Reds closing in on the Premier League title.\nThe ‘Egyptian King’ has been in blistering form this season, scoring 32 goals and providing 22 assists across all competitions so far. His new deal extends an already remarkable eight-year stay on Merseyside.\nThe free bets have Liverpool to wrap the title up by the start of May, having gained ascendancy with an 11-point lead at the time of writing – largely down to Salah’s contribution – the 33-year-old chasing a second winners medal as well as a fourth Golden Boot.\nAmid interest from Saudi Arabia, Salah’s commitment is a major boost for Arne Slot’s ambitions. Liverpool fans can now look forward to more magic from their Egyptian King.\n“Of course I’m very excited,” he said. “We have a great team now. Before also we had a great team. But I signed because I think we have a chance to win other trophies and enjoy my football.\n“It’s great, I had my best years here. I played eight years, hopefully it’s going to be 10. Enjoying my life here, enjoying my football. I had the best years in my career.\n“I would like to say to [the fans], I am very, very happy to be here. I signed here because I believe we can win a lot of big trophies together. Keep supporting us and we’ll give it our best, and hopefully in the future we’re going to win more trophies.”\nSalah first arrived in the Premier League with Chelsea but struggled to make an impact before rebuilding his reputation at AS Roma. In 2017, he returned to England with Liverpool and hit the ground running, instantly becoming one of the league’s most feared forwards. His pace, finishing and relentless work ethic transformed him into a world-class talent almost overnight.\nSince joining Liverpool, Salah has won the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup. He’s also claimed three Golden Boots, a PFA Player of the Year award, and shattered numerous club and league records along the way.\nUnder Slot, the forward has embraced a more senior leadership role within the squad, guiding younger players and setting the standard on and off the pitch. He’s reinvented himself as a creative force, regularly dropping deep to link play, while still posing a constant goal threat from central areas.\nThe Dutchman praised the Egyptian King ahead of his pre-match conference for the home tie against West Ham, making it clear Salah’s contract was a top priority.\n“I’m happy, of course,” Slot said. “He’s shown at this club for so many years now how much has value he has for the team and for the club. We’re so happy he’s extended for two more years.\n“Relief? For the fans I think so. It’s no surprise to you I knew a bit better how the contract situation went. I knew a bit longer things were heading in the right direction. It is a big compliment to Richard Hughes because Mo Salah, as a free agent, can go to any club he wants to.”\nWith the Reds now closing in on the title, only time will tell how much more Salah will win as part of his Anfield legacy – already considered to be one of the best players to have graced the Kop across the club’s extensive history.",
