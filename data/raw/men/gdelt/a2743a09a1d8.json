Six points are an absolute necessity to revive their hopes for the continental event in Morocco 2025.\nTo accomplish what seems a daunting, yet possible target, head coach Otto Addo must get his decisions spot-on for the upcoming matches.\nJoySports’ takes a look at the three big dilemmas the trainer must resolve to achieve the back-to-back victories and keep the AFCON dream alive.\nWho slots at left-back?\nCoach Addo has three options at left-back - Alidu Seidu, debutant Isaac Afful, and Gideon Mensah - in his 25-man squad. Mensah has firmly established himself in the role following Baba Rahman's decision to step away from the Black Stars due to heavy criticism of his performances, further complicated by his relationship with Ghana FA boss Kurt Okraku.\nHowever, Mensah’s absence due to injury in the last two matches was sorely felt, exposing the team’s inability to fully utilize the left-back position. Seidu, who featured in this role, put in a decent defensive shift, but his limitations were clear, especially in offensive play. He completed none of his four crossing attempts and managed just one key pass across both games against Angola and Niger, despite scoring a goal.\nWhile Mensah would have been the obvious choice to start against Sudan, concerns linger about his fitness and readiness after returning from the sidelines. The 26-year-old has made only one start for Auxerre this season.\nThis situation leaves the gaffer with the option of starting newboy Afful, who has impressed at FC Samartex in both the Ghana Premier League and the Champions League this season. The 25-year-old, who made 23 appearances last season, played a pivotal role in the club’s maiden title triumph and their progression to the second round of CAF’s inter-club competition, including scoring against Victoria United.\nAfter days of training, Addo has had the chance to assess the qualities and readiness of all three players and should be well-positioned to make the right choice in a match where there is no margin for error. The stakes are high, and the decision made could be crucial to the team's hopes of qualifying for the tournament.\nNew midfield pair?\nTwo of the Black Stars' most dependable midfield generals, Thomas Partey and Salis Abdul Samed, will be absent from the squad for the doubleheader against Sudan. Salis, a rock in defensive midfield, has been sidelined by a persistent muscle injury, while Arsenal star man, Partey, had to make a sudden withdrawal due to 'illness,' according to the Ghana Football Association.\nThe duo, who forged a formidable partnership at the heart of Ghana's midfield at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, played key roles in securing back-to-back victories over Mali and the Central African Republic in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers.\nHowever, with both players missing for the upcoming games, the pressure is on coach Addo to tinker with his squad and find the best possible solutions to fill the significant void.\n“Yeah, we're always not happy if players which we call are not there. If somebody is sick or injured or whatsoever, we are happy that our replacements came in on time, and they're here to help us,” Addo said at the pre-match press conference.\nAuxerre midfielder Elisha Owusu, who has been ever-present for his club in all seven Ligue 1 matches this season, is likely to be seen as a prime option by the technical team to fill the midfield void, alongside Anderlecht’s Majeed Ashimeru. The 27-year-old, who dazzled as arguably Ghana’s best player at the 2023 AFCON, could be handed another opportunity to shine on the international stage.\nAtalanta’s Ibrahim Sulemana, despite being hampered by injuries and limited to just two Serie A appearances, could emerge as a wildcard option.\nMeanwhile, Francis Abu has also been waiting patiently in the wings. Having featured 10 times for Belgian Pro League club Cercle Brugge this season, the 23-year-old may finally get his moment to step up in the absence of Partey.\nWhere does in-form Antoine Semenyo play?\n“Semenyo on the right wing is an absolute star... it cost £10 million to bring him over from Bristol City, and what a fantastic signing he’s been. He’s worth a fortune; such a graceful, powerful player. He’s got everything, that young man,” Former Liverpool and Spurs midfielder Jamie Redknapp on Sky Sports, lauding the Ghanaian forward.\nSemenyo, who has featured on the right flank in six of the seven Premier League games this season, has netted three goals and provided one assist. To put that into perspective, those three goals are nearly half of the eight he managed throughout last season and exceeds his tally for Ghana (2) in 21 appearances.\nAt the national level, the 24-year-old has predominantly played either as a left winger or center-forward, while Fatawu Issahaku has often been favoured on the right flank. However, what seems to be disrupting his rhythm is the constant shifting of positions. He’s yet to get a consistent run of games in a single role, which prevents him from becoming familiar with it and ultimately maximizing his potential on the field.\nIt is imperative for Addo to identify a suitable role for Semenyo, coupled with the right instructions, to unlock the player’s full potential here. With the team managing just one goal - from defender Alidu Seidu - in 180 minutes, Semenyo could be the key to resolving the toothless attack and reigniting the nation’s hopes for qualification.\nLatest Stories\n-\nWaiting in the Ring: life inside Bukom’s halted boxing scene\n4 minutes -\nOfori-Atta saga: Red Notice ends after arrest – OSP official clarifies\n49 minutes -\nHealth Minister to chair probe into ‘No Bed Syndrome’ death; promises system overhaul\n2 hours -\nPrime Insight to tackle ‘galamsey tax’ debate, cocoa reforms and Ayawaso East fallout this Saturday\n2 hours -\nCocoa crisis, galamsey complicity and election credibility to dominate this Saturday’s Newsfile\n3 hours -\nINTERPOL deletes Red Notice for Ofori-Atta as extradition process continues — OSP confirms\n3 hours -\nMasterMinds resources positions itself as key player in skills development and workforce training\n4 hours -\nINTERPOL has deleted Ofori-Atta’s Red Notice – Lawyers\n5 hours -\nSteven Spielberg donates $25,000 to James Van Der Beek’s $2m GoFundMe\n5 hours -\nSix possible effects of Trump’s climate policy change\n5 hours -\nBooming Indicators, Dying Rivers: Ghana under Chronic Environmental Poisoning\n6 hours -\nWorld’s rules-based order ‘no longer exists’, Germany’s Merz warns\n6 hours -\nThe Accra Mandate: Securing Africa’s AI Future through Local Data and Ethical Governance\n6 hours -\nAquafresh donates to National Chief Imam ahead of Ramadan\n6 hours -\nAdopt a mix of bond and short-term finance to address financing challenges in cocoa industry – Professor Peprah to government\n6 hours",
