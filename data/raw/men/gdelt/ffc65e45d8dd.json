  "body_text": "Chelsea were back on the winning side last night as we took on the worst team in the league — not quite the worst in the competition’s history, but possibly quite close! — overcoming plenty of growing angst (inside and outside the ground) to easily sweep aside Southampton, 4-0.\nEnzo Maresca asks for Chelsea fans’ trust in top-four battle, backs Filip Jörgensen, Cole Palmer\nPost-match comments from the boss\nNothing’s ever guaranteed in football of course. Though this was as easy as it might ever get in the Premier League, at the end of the day, a win’s a win and perhaps a nice momentum change on which to build for the final months of the season. Enzo Maresca certainly was in a bullish mood afterwards, asking for a bit of trust from the fickle mob and making it quite clear that we’re targeting a top-four finish (or top-five thanks to UEFA coefficients) and a spot in the Champions League. That’s quite the change from just the other day!\n“Very important [win] because we know that from now on every game is important. [We] are probably in our worst moment in terms of results but we are fourth, one point from the third. [...] That shows how good we had been in the first part of the season; now it’s just a matter of trying to finish in the best way.\n“[...] These kinds of games that everyone takes for granted, they are dangerous. Any small detail can make the difference. Tonight was a must-win. And from now, they are all must-wins because we’re going to try to reach our target [...] to finish top-four, top-five, and in the Champions League. So we are happy for tonight’s game.\n“[...] In this moment, the fans, they have to trust because we are in the right process, we are in the right direction. [But] especially I think they have to trust the players because the players they are doing a huge effort every day to bring this club where this club has to be, that is in the Champions League.”\n“Are we not entertained?” he might have asked, though he might have also realized that it’s hard to get too excited about Filip Jörgensen being told to dawdle on the ball to bait a press that’s never coming, especially amid the current vibes.\n“My message to Filip was, ‘If you play long ball, I will change you’. So he was just doing what I said to him. [...] It’s difficult for all the keepers but they are just following the plan.\nPerhaps the one not-so-positive note from this game was Cole Palmer’s continuing inability to finish a chance, which is starting to affect even his icey-cool demeanor.\nMaresca offered Palmer some words of encouragement on the pitch after the game, relaying them in the press conference when asked about our young talisman’s sudden drop in form.\n“Cole Palmer is a human being. [We] all go through a bad moments. [...] In this moment, Cole’s struggled to score, or struggled to do the right thing, but he’s happy, he knows exactly that it’s something normal. [He’s] shared time in a big club with big players and he knows that all the big players, they go through moments like this.\n“It’s how you react and he’s reacting perfectly. He’s laughing, he’s happy, he has to enjoy football. And for sure, we don’t have any doubt he’s going to score more goals.”\n-Enzo Maresca; source: HaytersTV\nSo say we all.",
