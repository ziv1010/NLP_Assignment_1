Anything that we’ve attempted to do has just been knocked back at the moment.”\nHe says there is nothing new on Preston striker Jordan Hugill, who Preston boss Simon Grayson confirmed yesterday had been the subject of Town interest.\n“I asked Simon after we played them here about him, actually,” the Town boss continued. “There’s nothing further, no.”\nQuizzed on whether he’s currently got any bids in for players, McCarthy responded: “Yes.”\nOutlining the process the Blues manager, whose top target is still understood to be Rotherham frontman Danny Ward, added: “It’s a bit like bidding for a house, you ring up and some say they’ll think about it, some say he’s not for sale and some say ‘foxtrot oscar’.\n“Some say we’ll discuss it with the board and come back and generally they always say no. That’s what’s happened so far.”\nIs he hopeful that the latest bids might be more successful? “Yes, if I haven’t got hope I wouldn’t have anything, would I? I’ve always got to be hopeful that one of them will drop.”\nMcCarthy says he’s received tentative interest in some of his squad: “I think there may be [some interest].\n“I’ve had no direct calls, but the usual. A lot of agents are trying to drum up business, that’s their job in the window. They only get two windows to do it now they can’t go through the season. But no firm interest, none that I would even consider anyway.”\nPhoto: TWTD\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\nWhat? i'm supposed to be commenting in this story? oh, ok. yeah shame, no players in yet.\nHate to see it, but it'll be loans who don't turn into permanent signings.\nIf anything happens at all that is.\nI thought at pre-season that Mick looked like he'd had enough. I now really think he has had enough - especially with us supporters.\nMaybe Evans won't settle his contract and let him go. Who knows.\nMarcus Bignot, Grimsby manager...\n\"People are saying we're asking millions for Omar. We haven't put a price tag on his head. We've said he's not for sale but we can't stop football clubs putting in offers.\nJohn has said he's not for sale and credit to him because he's showing ambition. With Omar Bogle, we can get success.\nI don't know whether that right offer — that we can't turn down — will come in January, the summer or the year after.\"\nNo, the Club shot themelves in the foot not for letting Murphy go without a replacement lined up, but more for not PLANNING at least a season ago to get someone in for the player.\nThe Academy playesr: If they are not \"good enough\" to be put in the team, DONT put them on the bench unless you intend to play them.\nIf they are good enough , PLAY THEM.\nThere just seems to be some fundamental issues with this once great Club now . Are all levels of the playing staff , playing to the same tactics? I suggest, No! Why do we always get players in that are returning from injury and need building their fitness up ......or players that are always injury prone. WHY??? They cant enhance ITF frist team squad can they. All they do is take up valuable financial resources, so MM cant go and sign another player.\nITFC really does appear and more worringly FEEL like a Club in decline. The powers that be , have either little interset or little control over the Clubs direction and impetus. We are slide ever South ward IMO . Another loss Saturday ( can anyone REALLY see us winning ?) and we are within spitting distance of a relegation dog fight.\nAll very depressing .\nSo if we were all happy-clappy and smiley despite being served a diet of long ball defensive football would we be in a better position? I doubt it very much.\nI think most Ipswich supporters are quite patient and are able to put up with defeat if we could see progression. All we see is long ball defensive football. We are told to get behind the team but what is there to get behind? A bunch of donkeys led by a ultra cautious manager whose idea of taking a risk is to actually try and win a game. I'm fed up of having to listen to a manager who thinks playing passing football is somehow sexy and will lead us to League One.\nI want to get behind the team, I really want to - but at the moment what is there to get behind?\nI'll be at Grimsby v Exeter tomorrow. Could be his last game here. I think he could be a future option for us but he's not ready to fill Murph's boots at all just yet.\nAnd you feel we haven't even reached the bottom yet\nBetween them Evans and #anker are killing our once proud club, sorry times indeed !!\nWe won't get anyone if we keep going in for players from rival clubs & not not going to pay the fee's they are asking for.\nLeague one players to look at - Billy Sharp - sheff Utd, Lee Gregory - Mwall, Josh Morris Scunthorpe, Chris McGuire, Oxford, they are all banging the goals in for their clubs, sign one of them up, should cost 75k - 1m for a good player who should be able to carry on scoring goals in the championship!!!\nHave witnessed this before of course in 50+ years;but have only had two highs in the nearly 10 years that Evans has owned the club.The League Cup Semi-Final under Roy Keane and reaching the playoffs under this manager,and there is nothing on the horizon to indicate anything is about to change,with Mick seemingly having trouble getting players into the club now unlike when he first arrived.\nTwo or three on here have berated people like me,and many others, for being so downbeat;and partly blaming the fans for not giving the team their undying support regardless.I don't set out to be pessimistic,and want ITFC to do well.\nI will go tomorrow,more in hope than expectation;but do not feel that a boycott serves any useful purpose either.\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
