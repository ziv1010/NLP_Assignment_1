I didn't really know what I wanted and where I would go,\" he said.\n\"It's really helped bring back that love for the game that maybe I didn't have to the maximum capacity.\n\"Especially under Johnny and the coaches, it's been nothing but good times and good memories and something that I'm glad I decided to jump into and join this group of players and a club that's got so much history.\"\nSemi-professional Heidelberg's men include bricklayers, civil engineers and electricians who have juggled work with up to 40 games this season.\nA proud club with Greek foundations and a rich history, Heidelberg are relishing taking the local community on the journey with them.\nThey expect a bumper crowd to travel from Olympic Village to South Melbourne's Lakeside Stadium for the occasion.\n\"Our supporters haven't seen this sort of thing for so many years,\" Anastasiadis said.\n\"So for them to be part of it, they're super excited.\n\"We're getting people at every training session, turning up and hugging us, kissing us - can't wait for the game.\"\nThis is the closest Lesiotis has come to an Australia Cup title, while he is \"speechless\" at the thought of Heidelberg playing in Asia - something most semi-professional players \"wouldn't even think about\".\n\"It's starting to really really hit us now as we get closer that for some of us, or maybe all of us, it could be the only chance we get to lift this trophy,\" Lesiotis said.\n\"That's why we don't want to let anyone down and give everything we have and not leave anything in the tank at the end of the game, and hopefully create history for this club.\"\nAustralian Associated Press",
