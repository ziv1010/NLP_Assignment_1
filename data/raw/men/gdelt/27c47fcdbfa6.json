  "body_text": "Galatasaray striker Victor Osimhen has revealed his long-standing admiration for Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone after the Spanish side held the Turkish champions to a 1–1 draw in their penultimate group stage match of the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday, PUNCH Sports Extra reports.\nOsimhen returned straight into the starting line-up for Galatasaray, barely a week after returning from the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco.\nThe striker was on the pitch for the full 90 minutes but could not prevent the potentially damaging draw, which has now put Galatasaray’s progress in the UEFA Champions League in doubt ahead of the final game of the group phase.\nGiuliano Simeone broke the deadlock inside four minutes at RAMS Park, but an own goal by Marcos Llorente, following a Rolland Sallai cut-back, levelled the score for Okan Buruk’s men in the 20th minute.\nReflecting on the result and Atletico’s identity, Osimhen spoke glowingly about their coach.\n“I love Diego Simeone. I’ve always been a fan of him. I’ve had the opportunity to meet him a few times. They play aggressively and have a clear identity. Since the coach has been there for many years, the players are completely accustomed to the kind of game he wants,” Osimhen said.\n“That’s why I’m putting so much emphasis on the performance we put out, because Atletico Madrid is one of the best teams in the world, and even getting a draw against them shows that you’re on the right track.”\nGalatasaray are currently 17th in the league phase with 10 points and need a positive result in their final fixture to remain in the competition. A defeat would most likely spell the end of their European campaign, as they sit just below the top 16 qualification places.\nLooking ahead to their next challenge, Osimhen turned his attention to Manchester City.\n“Manchester City is one of the best teams in the world. We’re going to play the game. We’ll focus on the league first, then we’ll focus on that game.\n“It won’t be easy, but I trust my team. I’m looking at it positively, and we can get something out of there. Let’s play a good game as we did against Atletico; that’s the most important,” the 2023 African Player of the Year concluded.\nEarlier this season, Osimhen said he was ready to take Galatasaray to new heights in the UEFA Champions League, insisting, “It’s time to make a statement in the most prestigious games.”\nThe striker has enjoyed a strong start to the campaign, scoring six goals in five appearances so far, although the club’s progress in Europe remains in the balance.\nAt the just-concluded AFCON in Morocco, Osimhen also scored four goals and provided two assists as Nigeria settled for the bronze medal. He was also named in the Confederation of African Football’s Team of the Tournament.",
