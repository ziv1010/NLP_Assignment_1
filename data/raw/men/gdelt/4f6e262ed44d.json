  "body_text": "Thiago Silva has stated his intent to ‘coach all the teams where I have played’ – including Chelsea – as the Brazil legend nears retirement.\nOne of the greatest defenders of his generation, Silva is best known for his eight-year spell at PSG where he won 19 major trophies, as well as winning over 100 caps for his country and lifting the 2019 Copa America.\nIn 2020, he joined Chelsea on a free transfer but much wasn’t expected of the centre-back given that he was 36-years-old at the time and supposedly at the end of his playing career.\nYet, he ended up becoming a much-loved player at Stamford Bridge, playing a key role in winning the Champions League in his debut season before going into lift the UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup.\nSilva remained a vital part of the Blues defence but, much to the frustration of fans, his contract was not renewed and he departed west London in 2024, re-joining Brazilian club Fluminese where he remains today.\nNow 41, the defender is still going strong but appears close to hanging up his boots, with his contract up next summer, though he still has dreams of going to the 2026 World Cup.\nSpeaking about his plans post-retirement, Silva has made it clear he wants to go into coaching and has an ambitious target in mind for his career in the dugout.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

To anticipate where the ball’s going to land or where the man’s going to be and it’s not easy but to know that as a defender it makes your life so much easier.\n‘In terms of off the field, recovery. Obviously, the age he is now… what he was doing, just recovering, doing the right stuff, eating right, sleeping right, being in the best shape for you to then perform in games.\nAsked if Silva was very free with his advice and helpful to the younger players,’ Chalobah replied: ‘Most definitely.\n‘He knows the experience he has. He knows the level he’s played at, the things he’s won and how he can give back and it’s through that and it’s through talking to the younger players.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Michael Owen makes Mo Salah prediction after ‘okay’ performance against Brighton\nMORE: Arsenal 2-1 Wolves: Gunners move five points clear at the top after dramatic win\nMORE: Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall injury update after Everton lose at Chelsea",
