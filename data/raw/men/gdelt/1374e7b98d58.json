Critics say local football legends should have been honoured, especially since several past and present members of India's national team are Goan.\nEd Sheeran\nA statue of Ed Sheeran was put up in Moscow in Russia , ahead of the star's first concert in the country.\nThe five-metre figure appeared at the entrance of Moscow's Gorky Park as as part of his ÷ (Divide) tour in 2019.\nOne fan commented on social media: \"Has any other country done this to celebrate an Ed Sheeran concert? Because I would love a whole army of these things!\"\nDonald and Melania Trump\nThis sculpture of US President Donald Trump has been built in Slovenia - where his wife Melania is from.\nThe painted wooden structure has been put up in a village there. It's eight metres tall and has been designed by local artist Tomaz Schlegl.\nTrump's statue triggered a mixed reaction though, with some people describing it as \"ugly\".\nIt joins the statue of his wife and former US First Lady Melania Trump in her hometown of Sevnica in Slovenia where it caused quite a stir - but again not really for the right reasons.\nUS artist Brad Downey paid a local chainsaw expert Ales Zupevc to carve the statue from a tree trunk.\nBut some residents of Sevnica have said the piece is \"a disgrace\", a \"Smurfette\", and that \"it doesn't look anything like Melania\".\nMo Salah\nThis statue of Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah was unveiled in his home country of Egypt.\nThe statue shows Salah in his signature celebration pose with his arms outstretched to the crowd, but many felt it didn't quite hit the mark and looks absolutely nothing like him. Oh dear!\nCristiano Ronaldo, again...\nThis one needs no introduction.\nThe infamous Ronaldo statue was revealed in 2017 at a ceremony to name an airport after him on the Portuguese island of Madeira.\nIt quickly got replaced but we're not convinced the new one was THAT much better tbh.\nBarack Obama\nNow it's Mr Obama's turn to find out that being the most powerful man in the world doesn't guarantee you a realistic sculpture.\nThis clay version of former US President Barack Obama in Kogelo, Kenya was designed especially for his visit to his Kenya's Siaya County.\nHopefully Michelle was spared the same 'honour'!\nAndy Murray\nYou can see who this statue is meant to be - he's standing right beside it - but we're not sure we'd have known without the clue!\nWould you know who this statue was supposed to look like?\nThe statue is of the tennis ace dressed as a Chinese warrior ahead of the Shanghai Masters in 2011.\nBut some people thought the face looked less like Andy and more like former Manchester United and Spurs manager Jose Mourinho.\nDavid Beckham\nLike Ronaldo, Mr Beckham has had a few unusual, erm... tributes.\nThis one was unveiled in Los Angeles in March 2019.\nUS team LA Galaxy displayed it outside their stadium in honour of the player's five seasons at the club.\nWhile you might be able to tell that it's David from the face, it looks to us as though David has a few extra arms..!\nThe multi-armed statue was not the only time that David Beckham has been immortalised in this way.\nHe's known for many things in addition to his glittering football career. For one, he has done lots of modelling, which has often featured him parading around in his underwear.\nSo as part of an advertising campaign, a silver statue of the former England football captain in his underpants was put on show in New York\nIt was supposed to be a clever joke but in the end most people were laughing at it rather than laughing with it.\nWe wonder if David himself saw the funny side...\nZinedine Zidane\nThe football superstars with shocking statues just keep on coming.\nThis time, it's Zinedine Zidane - a true sporting legend who won the Champions League with Real Madrid, the World Cup in 1998 and Euro 2000 with France. He also won the World Player of the Year Award three times and has managed Read Madrid to three Champion's League wins!\nBut this statue shows the former France captain during one of his worst moments - when he was sent off in the World Cup Final in 2006 against Italy.\nHe butted Italy defender Marco Materazzi in the chest and was given a red card.\nWould you really want this immortalised in a statue? Well, too late now!\n- Published12 July 2019\n- Published9 May 2019\n- Published28 February 2019",
