  "body_text": "Updated The Premier League have reportedly recommended to the independent commission into Everton's alleged breach of Profitability and Sustainability rules that the club be docked up to 12 points as punishment.\nAccording to an \"exclusive\" from The Telegraph, the League want the penalty to be severe should the panel agree that the Blues flouted spending rules based on the club's annual accounts for the 2021/22 financial year. And according to The Times, the decision could affect the price that 777 Partners pay should their takeover bid pass the approval process later this year.\nThough Everton recorded significantly reduced losses, their deficit over the rolling three-year period ran to £304m, almost three times more than the permitted £105m.\nThe club have attributed a significant portion of those losses to the outsized impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the costs of building the new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock and, having had their transfer activity overseen by the Premier League for the past two years, they insist they were in compliance.\nThe report in The Times suggests, however, that the alleged breach relates to \"a number of adjustments made to disclosed losses, of which one is interest payable on loans to build the club’s new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock.\"\nEverton said they would “robustly defend” their position to the panel and experts on football finances suggest that the club are likely to appeal any penalty, potentially dragging the process out for many more months.\nWhile the Telegraph's report suggests that the Blues could face a maximum penalty of 12 points, the panel could instead impose a fine, transfer embargo, or both. Their ruling is expected \"soon\" and, assuming the punishments aren't suspended, The Times say any points deduction would be imposed immediately.\nA 12-point deduction could have devastating consequences for Everton given how close they came to being relegated in each of the last two seasons and would in itself represent a financial penalty, even if Sean Dyche and his team were able to surmount the huge handicap, given that every position in the table is worth around £2.6m.\nThe Premier League's recommendation could also have significant implications for Manchester City who have been charged on 115 counts of breaking finance rules themselves, and Chelsea who are also under investigation.\nReader Comments (314)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Disclaimer ()\n1 Posted 25/10/2023 at 13:28:36\nThe Premier League has recommended that Everton face a 12-point deduction in its case against them for breaching profit and sustainability rules, the Telegraph has learned.\nEverton are facing the threat of severe sanctions if they lose their fight against allegedly breaking the Premier League's financial regulations, with a decision due later this year.\nTelegraph Sport understands the Premier League has recommended the punishment to be extremely severe, and up to a maximum of 12 points. Such a sanction would put them in grave risk of going down, given the team's relegation battles in recent seasons and precarious current position of 16th, three points off the relegation zone. Everton's case is currently being heard by an independent commission after they recorded financial losses of £371.8million over a three-year period, which is well over the permitted amount of £105million set out by the Premier League.\nI thought the commission was to decide if there was a charge to answer and then arrive at a suitable punishment, this makes it sound as if we are going to be found guilty and hit with a points deduction.\n2 Posted 25/10/2023 at 13:35:27\nThat's nice, isn't it. Thanks a lot, Premier League. I will be watching how you deal with the good people at Anfield and Manchester City with interest.\n3 Posted 25/10/2023 at 13:45:33\n4 Posted 25/10/2023 at 13:50:02\n5 Posted 25/10/2023 at 13:54:18\n6 Posted 25/10/2023 at 13:55:39\n7 Posted 25/10/2023 at 13:56:18\nWe feel relieved, they'll see a job well done. A good game played slow.\n8 Posted 25/10/2023 at 13:57:45\nThe journo who wrote it has tweeted \"Premier League demands 12-point deduction as maximum punishment if Everton are found guilty of breaching financial rules. Important to note that final decision will be made by an independent commission. Everton maintain they have complied with the rules\"\nThe club have repeatedly confirmed the same to us (FAB) that they believe they have no case to answer and will be cleared â€“ however I was also told last week (by a non-FAB source) that one of Everton's more recent investors/loaners has been advised that they might get a suspended fine, however they are not expecting a points deduction.\nThe hearing was originally scheduled to take place tomorrow, however there were various reports that it actually started last week but there has been no official confirmation of that, nor has there been any date stated for when the outcome will be announced.\n9 Posted 25/10/2023 at 13:58:46\nAny new cases will be dealt with under their “fast trackâ€ process and have points deducted in the current season.\n10 Posted 25/10/2023 at 13:59:36\n11 Posted 25/10/2023 at 14:04:35\nIf you were responding to my post, there's no need to assume anything, I put the source and time and date of the report. The only thing I couldn't do was read the complete article as it's behind a paywall.\n12 Posted 25/10/2023 at 14:07:26\n13 Posted 25/10/2023 at 14:14:16\nThe club can certainly appeal any decision, but I don't think it will be a long-drawn-out process.\nThe independent commission will be chosen by Murray Rosen KC, who is currently the chair of the Premier League Judicial Panel. He will select a three-member panel to form the commission, which will meet behind closed doors. These can be selected from among the 15 members of the Judicial Panel or from outside the organisation. Either party, Everton or the Premier League, can appeal the judgment, which would then go to the Premier League Appeal Panel.\n14 Posted 25/10/2023 at 14:25:06\nIgnore my post in my previous response, but you should have made it clearer that what you posted was a tweet from the Fan Advisory Board. No sweat.\n15 Posted 25/10/2023 at 14:56:16\nHow the hell does a no-mark journalist know what the Premier League are demanding?\nNo respectable Premier League representative would say anything prior to the hearing and decision.\nNo mention of Newcastle, Forest or Chelsea either â€“ let alone Man City's alleged 100+ breaches.\n16 Posted 25/10/2023 at 15:06:41\n17 Posted 25/10/2023 at 15:12:29\nI think we all know the answer to that question when you look at the names of the teams involved.\nMaybe we would be better going into administration now as it would be a lesser punishment, going by what happened to Portsmouth.\n18 Posted 25/10/2023 at 15:41:44\nMeanwhile, here is the real extent of the jeopardy we potentially face \"in the case of a Respondent which is a Club:\nSuspend it from playing in League Matches or any matches in competitions which form part of the Games Programmes or Professional Development Leagues (as those terms are defined in the Youth Development Rules) for such period as it thinks fit;\nDeduct points scored or to be scored in League Matches or such other matches [as above];\nRecommend that the League expels the Respondent from membership [of the League];\nOrder the Respondent to pay compensation unlimited in amount to any Club (or clubs);\nCancel or refuse the registration of a Player registered or attempted to be registered in contravention of these Rules;\nImpose upon the Respondent any combination of the foregoing or such\nother penalty as it shall think fit;\nMake any such penalty conditional, including imposing the penalty unless a defined action is taken by the Respondent within a defined period of time;\nOrder the Respondent to pay such sum by way of costs as it shall think fit which may include the fees and expenses of members of the Commission;\nand/or\nMake such other order as it thinks fit.\"\nSource: Premier League Handbook 2023-24\n19 Posted 25/10/2023 at 15:43:17\nâ€Amazing to read the Premier League are recommending Everton get a 12-point deduction if found guilty. Yet when 6 Premier League clubs met in secret to destabilise the Premier league by joining a breakaway ESP league their punishment was a measly fine.â€\nTo borrow a quote that Bill Kenwright used at a Hillsborough memorial at Anfield, he said the authorities have picked on the wrong City and the wrong Mums.\nMaybe we need to change the wording slightly and tell the Premier League: wrong club and wrong fans, who wont lie down and let you walk over us.\n20 Posted 25/10/2023 at 15:44:17\nEverton are facing the threat of severe sanctions if they lose their fight against allegedly breaking the Premier League's financial regulations, with a decision due later this year.\nTelegraph Sport understands the Premier League has recommended the punishment to be extremely severe, and up to a maximum of 12 points. Such a sanction would put them in grave risk of going down, given the team's relegation battles in recent seasons and precarious current position of 16th, three points off the relegation zone.â€\nBring it on. This will galvanise the team.\n21 Posted 25/10/2023 at 15:46:59\n22 Posted 25/10/2023 at 15:50:24\nAnd if this is true, it opens a big can of worms for other clubs and the Premier League.\n23 Posted 25/10/2023 at 15:52:49\nSurely there's a range based on the offences? Or is it like the Bloody Code where every offence from murder to stealing a handkerchief gets the death penalty?\n24 Posted 25/10/2023 at 16:01:58\n25 Posted 25/10/2023 at 16:07:08\n26 Posted 25/10/2023 at 16:14:25\nI expect so. Isn't this hearing today? Guess we will soon find outâ€¦\n27 Posted 25/10/2023 at 16:15:08\nIt might well be a separate incident, but rules were broken and punishment should have been served.\nIs it any wonder people know the Premier League is corrupt to the core, looking after the elite few?\nIf we have broken the rules, then we deserve to get punished, but others should not be allowed to get away with breaking rules.\n28 Posted 25/10/2023 at 16:19:28\nDid they think “We'll kick em while they're downâ€?\nWell bring it on, we'll show them what a proper Football Club we are, bring it on.\nOut of adversity UTFT's\n29 Posted 25/10/2023 at 16:20:44\n30 Posted 25/10/2023 at 16:23:30\nRegardless of what the Premier League are 'recommending' in Everton's Financial Fair Play case - it will be the independent commission who decide on any potential sanctions if the club were to be found guilty of any breaches of rules.\nThe ECHO understands that the independent commission â€“ not the Premier League â€“ holds full sway when it comes to the final decision-making process. In the event of a breach being found, the next step would be that the commission decide upon any sanctions and if any sanctions such as a points deduction were agreed upon then it would also be at the discretion of the commission to decide upon which season to impose them, whether that be current, retrospectively (the charge relates to the 2021/22 season) or in a future campaign.\nWhat will happen to Everton next after Premier League points deduction 'threat'\n31 Posted 25/10/2023 at 16:26:14\nUp to...\nWould recommend...\nif they ding us, they have to absolutely crush man City.\nAll this seems ridiculous. Have the damn hearing and stop the predictions. Then slap us on the wrist with a transfer ban or some such thing.\nI would be shocked if they dock us any points at all.\nWe'll see.\n32 Posted 25/10/2023 at 16:27:58\nI realize you're just sharing this story but how on Earth would a retrospective points deduction work?\nWould we lose some TV money? Would the league table have an asterisk saying “should have been relegatedâ€? That seems like a nonsense kind of punishment that would surely set up a legal storm with the relegated clubs.\n33 Posted 25/10/2023 at 16:29:10\n34 Posted 25/10/2023 at 16:30:12\nI imagine that particular eventuality would only come into play, if the hearing was concluded between seasons.\n35 Posted 25/10/2023 at 16:35:27\nApart from 'recommended... up to a maximum of 12 points' what does it say?\nIt is all journalisic padding or, more accurately, flummery, malarkey, crock, drivel, poppycock or perhaps even prattle, tattle, palaver or the one I prefer... twaddle!\nWhat exactly do they mean by 'recommended'? And up to 12 points?\nSo according to this, for want of a better word, article (tho please feel free to substitute any of my previous adjectives)... they 'recommended' (whatever that means), a punishment that could be up to 12 points.\nWell, stab me vitals! That is the same as saying they 'recommended' (whatever that means), that, if guilty we should be punished from a range of possible punishments!\nAnd here's the thing: up to 12 points could, just as likely, include ordering Farhad to do a bit of volunteering work down at the local Oxfam!\nThe most irritating thing about this is not just that it is misleading bordering on mendacious, that has become par for the course when reporting on anything Everton. It is the fact that the Telegraph should choose to indulge in such vacuous story on the day after our Chairman died.\n37 Posted 25/10/2023 at 16:40:59\nI might be missing something here but I don't know how it seems to be Everton getting all the headlines about financial breaches. And, how is it that Man City didn't face stiff action over a decade ago when they were spending a fortune but not deriving revenue from the Champions League etc?\nSimilarly, how are Newcastle currently evading censure?\nI'm also not sure why we ourselves didn't get into hot water earlier? We were spending silly amounts in 2017 and 2018 with nothing much to show for it in league finishes, trophies or European qualifications?\nYet it has only taken until when we have significantly fallen down the table and faced two relegation battles that they want to make a points deduction that will have it's most devastating consequences than at any time between 2016 and 2021.\n38 Posted 25/10/2023 at 16:44:30\nClassic that one, the thought of Farhad working in Oxfam, or doing community work with his high vis vest on, picking chippy paper up, after a match, to work the punishment off.\n39 Posted 25/10/2023 at 16:48:17\n40 Posted 25/10/2023 at 16:50:37\nAnd then, after three clear Sundays, you will drop to the Championship where you will file for bankruptcy as there'll be no chance of paying off the debt.\n41 Posted 25/10/2023 at 16:58:30\nI don't see a points deduction as a likely outcome. The article simply states that a maximum points deduction of 12 points could be recommended.\n42 Posted 25/10/2023 at 16:59:22\n#UTFT\n43 Posted 25/10/2023 at 17:03:17\nIs the independent commission deciding the punishment or is the Premier League deciding with the Board's simply rubber-stamping the decision?\nIt all sounds like a stitch-up to me.\nMan City, Chelsea and Notts Forest have all flouted the rules, some for many years.\nWhy would our paltry single offence shoot to the top of the list?\n44 Posted 25/10/2023 at 17:08:42\nSurely we could mobilise our fan base and put the shits up the suits in West London.\n45 Posted 25/10/2023 at 17:13:52\nIn bed with murdering systems buying clubs, no problem.\nLetting West Ham off from points deduction for playing illegal players because they didn't want to see west ham supporters with tears in their eyes, no problem.\nBending over backwards to make sure Liverpool didn't go under, no problem.\nAnnouncing this on the day after Bill Kenwright died, unforgivable. We have had the knife in our backs from these bastards for a long time now, this just delivered the killer blow.\nHow can an independent commission be advised on what to do? With Everton it never rains but it pours.\n46 Posted 25/10/2023 at 17:14:57\nFor that reason alone, I can't see it happening. If it does, hire the best KC and the best PR company available and keep fighting.\n47 Posted 25/10/2023 at 17:18:53\n48 Posted 25/10/2023 at 17:20:26\n“Couldâ€ dock us up to 12 points.\nSounds like click bait to me, but if I've any slight concern about it, there's some kind of information management going on.\nSuch that, when the 6-point deduction is handed out, plus the probation and advance accounts submission, it seems fair, lenient and prevents a backlash.\nIf they give us 12 points deducted, where does that leave Man City and their 101 charges 101 x 12 = a 1212 points deduction. They'll be playing on Buckley Hill for the next 25 years.\nBrian, well pointed out, the punishment for negotiating behind the Premier League's back on starting a Super League, a fine which was a complete irrelevance.\n49 Posted 25/10/2023 at 17:22:47\n50 Posted 25/10/2023 at 17:26:17\nEuropean Super League: Court's final verdict on breakaway competition due in December\nFixed\n51 Posted 25/10/2023 at 17:28:58\nIf 12 points is the maximum for one charge, then Man City should, or could, possibly face a points deduction 1212 points.\nSo hand back all them Premier League trophies, FA Cups, league cups, one Champions League, and fuck off to the Manchester Sunday league!\n52 Posted 25/10/2023 at 17:37:32\nWe're playing West Ham at the weekend. I don't care about anything else right now.\nWin that and then it's only 9 points. Three games.\nI'm going for a fine and transfer embargo. If there is a points deduction, I think it would be delayed a season as there would be an appeal.\nAnd then what do they do with Man City (115 offences to our one)? And no doubt others. It will open a can of worms that we can rightfully point the finger at.\n53 Posted 25/10/2023 at 17:41:47\nIt's top secret but I hope it's not Jim Beglin, John Aldridge and Craig Pawson as the chair.\nRob ðŸ¤£ Grade 9 maths GCSE here we come.\n54 Posted 25/10/2023 at 17:42:15\n55 Posted 25/10/2023 at 17:58:31\n56 Posted 25/10/2023 at 18:00:31\nBut that assumes the misdemeanours are comparable and that a level of consistency will be applied\nWe all know that Everton seem to be mire harshly treated than other clubs for whatever reason so I'd ignore looking for consistency\nI can believe that we'll be docked points because the footballing authorities have it in for us and also because, if we're found guilty, it's not like we're a fiver over: we were x3 the permitted amount.\nNow we can point to Covid and subsequent good behaviour and that may all play a part in the sentencing but, in respect of guilt or not, I suspect that will be irrelevant.\nSadly I can see us being docked points this season. Irritating.\n57 Posted 25/10/2023 at 18:00:35\n58 Posted 25/10/2023 at 18:02:54\nThe cunts are going to make a point of fucking us over (just like the retrospective penalty ban) so the government don't set up their commission and find out just what a bunch of cheating money laundering cunts the Premier League is.\n59 Posted 25/10/2023 at 18:34:46\nNot much point in fining us as we haven't got any money so points deduction and/or transfer embargo it will likely be. The latter may not really be a penalty in any case (see first point above).\nIf it is a points deduction, I'm not sure how they could award it retrospectively as we'd be playing in the wrong division and presumably one of the relegated clubs from last year will sue someone.\nIf it's this season, then anything above 6 points and I think we're down barring a minor miracle. 6 or below and we've got a fighting chance. If it's 12 but starting next season, then a) we definitely down next season, and b) what happens if we drop this season? We start the Championship on -12 and basically drop into League One?\nSome big big weeks coming up for EFC.\n60 Posted 25/10/2023 at 18:44:00\n61 Posted 25/10/2023 at 18:44:31\n62 Posted 25/10/2023 at 18:46:09\n63 Posted 25/10/2023 at 18:47:27\nLet's see, what comes out in the next few weeks, from the EPL.\n64 Posted 25/10/2023 at 19:05:34\nI'm honestly not sure (it doesn't really make sense to believe this would help Everton) but who genuinely wants 777?\nAnd if something like this does happen, then maybe Moshiri will have to sell to others before our club is forced into administration?\nWith the passing of Bill Kenwright, maybe this is going to be our darkest hour, before a brand new dawn.\n65 Posted 25/10/2023 at 19:06:30\nI'm on the outside of three large G+T's, each of which would refloat the Bismark.\nNot even I can see 52 points. In fact, even though I'm seeing two of everythingâ€¦\n66 Posted 25/10/2023 at 19:13:08\nWhat is the worst crime?\nOver spending because of club incompetence (easy to prove) or going behind the back of the Premier League to secretly form a new competition (easy to prove).\nGet the Premier League in court and they will soon about turn.\n67 Posted 25/10/2023 at 19:14:32\nLuton, Sheff Utd and Burnley won't get more than 32 point each is my prediction.\n68 Posted 25/10/2023 at 19:20:24\nPerhaps the Premier League should be looking at themselves more closely.\n69 Posted 25/10/2023 at 19:32:02\n2) If the investigation is being done by an independent commission, the Premier League have no say on sanctions.\n3) Private and confidential, how did the Guardian get the article?\n4) If Man City were charged well before us, on 111 more charges, how are we being investigated first?\nIt also stinks that the Guardian printed this a day after the sad passing of our chairman, shame on them.\nOur club is definitely been targeted constantly by the Mail and Guardian.\nThe Premier League have a short memory considering we were one of the biggest clubs to back them, when the greedy 6 tried to sneak away. What were their sanctions for trying to break up the league?\n70 Posted 25/10/2023 at 19:46:05\nThe dickhead that spun this story should be hauled over the coals for misinformation.\nIf the arsehole was proven to be correct, then whoever leaked the story should be named and shamed and the result made invalid for breaking Premier League and independent commission rules.\n71 Posted 25/10/2023 at 19:48:26\nStrange though if it is a secret judge and jury, do they wear masks while questioning whoever defends us and keep them on while sending us down?\n72 Posted 25/10/2023 at 19:49:34\nI really don't think the Guardian has an agenda against us. The BBC, and of course the Premier League, are of course a different matter.\n73 Posted 25/10/2023 at 19:52:31\nNow that the Telegraph has published news that the Premier League would recommend a 12-point deduction to Everton, if found guilty, I decided to put my thoughts here, too.\nI have held this view that, if Everton are accused of one breach of the P&S rules, and punished for that in some extent, then Manchester City, who have 115 allegations against them relating to various breaches in the FFP rules over many years, should be punished accordingly.\nI know that the investigations and the hearings are done by two independent commissions, as of course the procedure must be, but there must be connection in the consequences which will follow after the verdicts. I mean that both clubs must be treated with the same principles and the possible punishments must be related to each other.\nEqual treatment for all, especially under jurisdiction, or any kind of investigation, that has been the norm in our democratic societies for a long time.\nSo we can say, leniently, that only 30 or 40 of the 115 alleged breaches made by Manchester City, merit the same penalty as EvertonÂ´s 1 breach. And if the penalty for Everton for that 1 breach is, say 5 or even as much as 12 points deduction, so accordingly City must get with our -5 points 150 or 200 points deduction, and with our -12 points City must suffer 360 or 480 points deduction. Otherwise, there is no respectability, and moreover no integrity in the actions of the Premier League and its independent commissions.\nHope those who represent Everton in our hearings bring this aspect forward, too, and stick to this attitude with unyielding stance. Of course the best outcome for Everton would be no punishment at all, or if some, then only fines. A short transfer embargo would also be better than points deductions. But all Evertonians should follow how we are dealt with in relation to Manchester City.\nIt also shows no sense of discretion by the Premier League if they really have made this recommendation just now, or by the Telegraph if they have speculated with this matter without any real evidence from the Premier League, a day or two after our Chairman passed away. Where is that famous English Gentleman code?\nThe culprits of this news should be ashamed of themselves by putting this up in the hour of the mourning of Everton Football Club.\n74 Posted 25/10/2023 at 19:56:02\n\"1) Did the Premier League not clear us of any irregularities a few months earlier?\"\nPretty sure they didn't but what makes you think that?\n75 Posted 25/10/2023 at 20:15:27\n76 Posted 25/10/2023 at 20:16:08\nWeren't the club in talks with the Premier League at the time, and sold Richarlison to stay on the right side of the P&S rules?\n77 Posted 25/10/2023 at 20:28:20\n78 Posted 25/10/2023 at 20:35:31\nNo, we must be made an example of. The opportunity is too good to miss to make a chest beating statement that does not hurt any other club. A sacrifice is needed.\nWe may be led by incompetent fools, but it is the fans and the game that will suffer.\nAn intended leak to pressure the commission and show how big they are.\nI am not going to feel hard done by in this game of chicken because we all know and understand what's going on. But exactly who and why it's being done to us is the question. An individual in the Premier League is driving such recommendations, someone with an agenda and significant influence, plays like this don't just happen, they are driven like any vendetta.\nIf this is not a made up story of clickbait and The Telegraph are just running with it, who, on the day after the death of the club's chairman, would want so badly to put the boot in to the club?\nCorruption is not just about money, it's about power aand the EPL have absolute power.\n79 Posted 25/10/2023 at 20:44:23\nI think the extent to which the Premier League were overseeing Everton's finances has been greatly exaggerated. Added to that the sale of Richarlison only balanced the books for the 3-year period ending 20-21.\nThe charges relate to the period ending 21-22.\n80 Posted 25/10/2023 at 20:45:01\nWhy don't they just hold the independent commission in the Sandon with Lego head Gerrard, fat teeth Klopp, and Graham Sourness and be done with it?\nHardly independent and impartial with all the negativity and speculation being thrown at us.\n81 Posted 25/10/2023 at 20:50:18\nThe stakes are so high, the source of this leak needs investigation. Who is the driving force, does he or she have an agenda?\nIt's the same as interfering with a jury when in deliberation. Why can't they leave it alone and let them come to what's meant to be an independent decision?\n82 Posted 25/10/2023 at 21:04:12\nThe atmosphere at every home game would be like the Palace game from last season!\n83 Posted 25/10/2023 at 21:12:58\nCoincidence that Leicester City were one of the teams relegated and might benefit from sueing Everton.\nIt might come back to bite him on the arse when they come after Leicester City and Forest, who will be next on their list, before Man City or Chelsea.\nLike I said a few months ago, I see us getting a slap on the wrist and possible 12-month transfer embargo, then they can justify handing out the same to Man City, we will be the example to put the fear of god into other clubs, then let City get off with a 12-month transfer embargo as well.\nWe will soon find outâ€¦\n84 Posted 25/10/2023 at 21:15:25\nThe 'Independent Commission' is a smokescreen. They'll do what the VAR does for referees.\nI'm more concerned about us reaching 33 points than I am about points deductions.\n85 Posted 25/10/2023 at 21:17:26\nMan City have refuted their charges saying they are without merit and won't deal with the independent commission Chair, Murray Rosen KC, as he is an Arsenal fan. Good strategy.\nThe Premier League giving Everton a points deduction of that magnitude sets a massive precedent with City's charges outstanding and their previous.\nEverton will have clear grounds for appeal, which suggests to me they are confident they won't get that severe a punishment.\n86 Posted 25/10/2023 at 21:20:52\n87 Posted 25/10/2023 at 21:45:52\nAthletic will be rubbing their hands.\n88 Posted 25/10/2023 at 21:46:19\nAlso, Everton have a net transfer spend of circa £185m in Moshiri's tenure. The last 5 years have been virtually nothing. They can't say we have a squad advantage due to spending as our squad was absolute gash.\nThese clubs should really look at themselves for being unable to finish above one of the worst Everton squads ever in the last two seasons. Pretty embarrassing for them seeking compensation if you ask me and, even if it was credible, just tie it up in legal red tape for years.\nSame as the independent commission, who clearly can't be independent if the Premier League can \"demand\" a points deduction. That's clearly undue influence. Load of hot air IMO.\n89 Posted 25/10/2023 at 22:00:26\nA fine for City is essentially saying they can do what they want and I can't see the other clubs settling for that. Transfer embargo feels more likely than just a fine.\n90 Posted 25/10/2023 at 22:00:41\nAre this \"independent\" commission shielding themselves from media and speculation?\nIf they have read or watched sports news lately relating to Everton and all the negativity from the Mail, Guardian, Independent â€“ even the Metro sticking a foot in at us, then surely that has some implications to an \"independent\" body that could serve a sanction on a club, business and community that employs a lot of people.\nNot just the club and our status as a Premier League team, but the wider implications of us being relegated due to a points deduction. People losing their jobs and livelihoods.\nThe implications are massive. Who are these people who will decide the fate of so many?\nCan they be trusted to make an honest, impartial assessment?\nSo much will be decided by these individuals, yet what do we know of them?\n91 Posted 25/10/2023 at 22:02:12\nThink the Man City ship has sailed. The European Courts decided they could do what they want when overturning the Uefa ban.\nThe Premier League also decided the breakaway 6 could do what they want when they tried to rip the Premier League apart with the European Super League. Where were the points deductions and embargoes there?\n92 Posted 25/10/2023 at 22:02:27\nYou bought into the hype around Richarlison's sale so much that you believed it got us the all-clear from the Premier League for the season in question. It didn't.\nI bought into the hype so much that I believed Richarlison's sale must have happened a season earlier. It didn't.\nI stand corrected but unfortunately, even with the sale of Richarlison, we weren't given the all-clear and the Premier League still believe we breached P&S guidelines that season.\n93 Posted 25/10/2023 at 22:17:32\n\"Hang him!\"\n\"What's he done?\"\n\"Doesn't matter, hang him!\"\n\"Who is accusing him of a crime?\"\n\"Who cares, Hang him!\"\nI wonder if The Telegraph and Daily Mail existed around the time of the crucifixion?\n94 Posted 25/10/2023 at 22:18:45\nI seem to recall Omar Niasse getting a suspension for basically “fooling the officialsâ€ or whatever it was. We see exactly the same happening every week but no suspensions. Precedents seem to only apply when it suits!\n95 Posted 25/10/2023 at 22:21:05\nI think it's because we have the potential to crack the Fox 6.\nNot with this team. But the real club. Us the fans.\nAlso, we do pull a significant number of fans away from brand number two, Liverpool.\n96 Posted 25/10/2023 at 22:21:59\nThe people who run the game are only interested in good news stories for their brand and sponsors and anything that spoils the image of the league will be frowned upon.\nEverton are not too big to fail, but it is too big a club to fail without sending a few shock-waves throughout the industry and beyond and it would create bad optics for the Premier League itself.\nTherefore, seeing Everton drop out of the Premier League and become a problem club for the Football League, might suit some of the more strident advocates of the Premier League.\nIf the commission doesn't find the club guilty, and we jump that particular hurdle, there is still more than a chance that the various administrative bodies could prevent the takeover by 777 Partners, which might spell administration and an automatic points penalty, which could also ultimately result in relegation.\nThis is possibly the most critical season of Everton's entire history, and most of it can't be controlled by the club or the players out on the pitch. If we open the new stadium as a Premier League outfit, we should all be truly thankful.\n#Pray4theToffees\n97 Posted 25/10/2023 at 22:26:37\nI'm pretty certain that Matt Hughes is related to a Roman scribe according to his family tree.\n98 Posted 25/10/2023 at 22:31:18\nThe Mail probably invented crucifixion!!!\nThey are drooling, foaming at the mouth for the story, begging the authorities to dock us points. All so they can have a few days of crappie stories about us.\n99 Posted 25/10/2023 at 22:38:32\nLike I said previously, you pay top dollar for top barristers, experts in their field. They will scrutinise every detail and previous punishments handed out. I accept if we are in the wrong we should be punished but setting a harsher punishment to set an example is simply wrong and unfair.\nThe courts are waiting. Take it to the top. Nothing to lose!\n100 Posted 25/10/2023 at 22:46:10\n1. Who picks the individuals that make up the panel of the “independentâ€ commission?\n2. Who are they?\n3. What are their credentials?\nPersonally I think “theyâ€ have a grudge on us for being involved with Alisher Usmanov.\n101 Posted 25/10/2023 at 22:46:11\nEverton are also a problem for the chip-on-their-shoulder red bastards who would dance on our grave despite John Moores funding their transfers back in the day, and then his nephew. Anything and everything we ever do for them is thrown back in our faces.\nBut the league doesn't want an Everton unless that Everton has an incredibly wealthy owner, preferably a sovereign, who will grease their palms and promote the Premier League. And they definitely didn't want a Monaco-based Iranian bookkeeper who allegedly fronted for one of Putin's oligarchs.\nThe media in this country is also culpable. Sky 6 is their bread and butter. But fear not â€“ they'll all die off pretty soon as kids don't buy it anymore. Listening to some media gobshite on Sky now â€“ they haven't got a clue.\nIf this happens it won't happen again. And I absolutely bet they'll push this through. Nailed on. The Man City case will just disappear up its own arse of money. And then we're at major risk of bankruptcy and losing the stadium. Play it through.\n102 Posted 25/10/2023 at 22:49:14\nI posted this information earlier in the day on this thread:\nThe independent commission will be chosen by Murray Rosen KC, who is currently the chair of the Premier League Judicial Panel. He will select a three-member panel to form the commission, which will meet behind closed doors.\nThese can be selected from among the 15 members of the Judicial Panel or from outside the organisation. Either party, Everton or the Premier League, can appeal the judgment, which would then go to the Premier League Appeal Panel.\n103 Posted 25/10/2023 at 22:51:32\nIf indeed the commission is still to be notified and the club, then once again that is a blight against the idiots running the league.\nIf the rules have been broken, then all other teams that have come under scrutiny and been found guilty should get the same penalty, even if it is one of the filthy rich clubs and at the same time as Everton.\nNever rains but it pours, eh?\n104 Posted 25/10/2023 at 22:53:57\nWho's going to stand up for our club?\nThis nonsense has gone on long enough, I'm sick of the attitude directed at EFC from match officials, self-serving pundits, journalists etc.\nThere's a bad smell coming from the Premier League, I really hope we make a stand and come out fighting to ensure other clubs have the same exposure to whatever precedent the independent commission is wanting to set on us.\n105 Posted 25/10/2023 at 22:56:20\n106 Posted 25/10/2023 at 22:58:28\nEvery news outlet under the sun has run this story based on the original Telegraph article, so none of the major print media outlets have covered themselves in glory, but let's be honest: most of them don't have a heart or a soul, even if they sometimes pretend that they have.\n107 Posted 26/10/2023 at 00:41:59\n108 Posted 26/10/2023 at 01:00:25\nIts greatest significance is that it indicates the degree of probability, after the last miserable decade, of the club as we know it effectively being extinguished before our eyes.\nWe have no board or senior management to speak of, an owner who has essentially disowned us, can't or won't fund us anymore, leaving us way closer to administration than many seem to think. A carcass for vultures to pick over.\nThat it has come to this...\n109 Posted 26/10/2023 at 01:05:17\nAnything else casts a huge shadow over the integrity of the game and the league (like there is any). It goes beyond relegation and right up to Euro qualification and titles.\nTheir independent committee will reach the right answer or they'll never get one of these sweetly remunerated gigs again. They will have been selected by someone who also appreciates where their paydays come from.\nDidn't you ever watch Yes, Minister?\nI don't even know if we've really flouted the rules... I just believe it's not in the league's best interests to find us guilty and punish us harshly.\nFor what it's worth, I'd happily see us punished if the same rules apply to others. The game needs some rules and the big clubs currently do whatever they want. But we know the rules won't be applied evenly... so that's barely worth talking about.\n110 Posted 26/10/2023 at 01:30:56\nNo respectable Premier League representative would say anything prior to the hearing and decision.\nCould that be described as an oxymoron?\n111 Posted 26/10/2023 at 02:18:37\nFrom 2010 Rugby League universe\nOn 22 April 2010, the Melbourne Storm were stripped of their titles of 2007 and 2009 Premierships and their 2006, 2007 and 2008 minor Premierships following an alleged insider tip-off to the NRL auditing body that the club had not been complying with the NRL salary cap.\nDeep thought: Are Man City the real target here? They are on the outer but are sweeping the board.\nNaarh. Just nobody likes us.\n112 Posted 26/10/2023 at 02:22:26\nMurray Rosen KC it seems is an arbitrator and Arsenal season ticket holder. I couldn't find anything about the actual identity of the panel members but it seems that, if the panel has already been chosen and is sitting, Everton haven't challenged the selection. We have to wait and see what drops.\nKevin #104 â€“ \"Who is going to stand up for our club?\"\nWell, Bill Kenwright has been ill and has passed away so it seems to me it is down to us. That is why we have to get behind the manager and players.\nHe might not be the greatest manager in the world but I am sure he has plenty of fight in him. Likewise, we may not have the greatest group of players in our squad but I have seen signs that they have fight in them.\nNevertheless he is our manager and they are our players. The match-going fans have a very important role to play. If we get a points deduction which, regrettably, I think is on the cards, we have to help them get another 35 to 41 points.\n113 Posted 26/10/2023 at 04:45:48\nIt arose after the Final Accounts were made available, and Everton was informed by the Premier League in August of last year, following a two-year monitoring period, that they were within the necessary Profit and Sustainability parameters.\nSomething appears to have changed their opinion. The terms of reference for the independent commission will be set, including recommendations regarding the limits of their power to impose a penalty.\nEverton will need to provide evidence to support their confident assertions of not being in breach, and they also have the right to appeal.\nThe penalty, if imposed, will be for the next season but subject to appeal, as the Premier League is unlikely to want to directly influence a current Premier League campaign mid-season.\nAs for why a Premier League independent commission has not been set up regarding Manchester City, who have been accused of over 100 breaches, and why UEFA is not acting regarding FFP rule breaches, it is unclear.\nChelsea has previously been investigated and their previous owner was scrutinized, leading to penalties and sanctions being imposed. It is possible that the current newspaper reports are speculative.\n114 Posted 26/10/2023 at 06:03:33\n115 Posted 26/10/2023 at 06:14:55\nPaul Joyce is reporting it's a stadium issue, which can't be correct as this is exempt from Profitability and Sustainability Rules.\nI would imagine anything reported before a hearing is complete will give Everton grounds to ask for a referral or even start a new hearing.\n116 Posted 26/10/2023 at 06:58:13\nTo play it out further to appease Leeds and Burnley, the Premier League may announce a 12-point deduction and fine, and on appeal, it will be reduced to the above.\nWe can draw a comparison with Man City's case and punishment when that appears in the public domain in five years time, and what of Chelsea who spend £1 billion on transfers, but don't break financial rules?\nThe Premier League should tread carefully with their decision on Everton or else they could be taking trophies off Man City and that wouldn't bode well for their fake image.\n117 Posted 26/10/2023 at 07:39:43\nIf there has been a leak and breach of confidence, then surely the entire enquiry is under the microscope and the focus has to be on why this information got out?\nIf true, there is a confidentiality issue, although the likelihood is speculative journalist gambling.\nI keep saying, we play West Ham on Sunday. That's where our focus needs to be.\n118 Posted 26/10/2023 at 07:49:53\nThe government used to regularly leak exaggerated bad news figures so that, when the actual ones came out, we had all got used to a possible worse scenario.\nSo 12 points, and we all freak out, but then 6 points and we swallow it meekly, just relieved it wasn't 12 after all.\n119 Posted 26/10/2023 at 07:57:43\n120 Posted 26/10/2023 at 08:06:52\nAsk yourself this question - who led the response to the ESL wannabees leaving the EPL ? Everton did. Moshiri put a public statement condemning them.Who takes money away from the RS ? We do, just by existing.\nThe ESL will happen. There is so much money involved it cannot fail to do so. Sanctions from FIFA and UEFA won't stop them. Footballers and their agents will joyfully go too and any threat of being banned from World Cups and the Euros will land on deaf ears. For me it cannot come soon enough because playing in the EPL is a joke.\nTeams attempting to compete are now prohibited by FFP rules that did not apply at the time, that City for instance, joined the so called elite. Teams outside the elite that make strides ie Leicester / Brighton, will have their best players plucked from them. and their momentum will be stopped in its tracks. We have been victims of this ourselves, Rooney, Lescott, Lukaku, Stones, Rodwell, Barkley, Pienaar, to name a few. Soon to be followed by Branthwaite and Onana. The money the elite now earn means they can offer £100m plus for players - Rice at Arsenal, Caicedo £116m at Chelsea - both players who only a couple of seasons ago would have cost less than £50m. The Chelsea squad is now valued at almost £1bn - transfer market. Evertons is £350m. Luton Towns is £87m !! Brighton the flavour of the month is £468m - still less than half of the Chelsea squad. Manchester Citys squad is worth £1.26bn - all figures from the Transfer Market website. In the long run even the RS ( £877m ), will be hard pressed to compete. Having just one team in a city certainly helps with the finances - ask Newcastle and Leeds. Perhaps the RS are hoping that, that scenario will play out for them too.\nAs for these articles about points deductions - ignore them. Though I do wonder if they would have put out such an article if Man U were the team under investigation, given the recent death of Sir Bobby Charlton - a man who perhaps died, despairing of, what had happened to the most beautiful game.\n121 Posted 26/10/2023 at 08:28:02\nYes exactly Danny so as you say I would file this as speculative journalist gambling.\n122 Posted 26/10/2023 at 08:39:42\n123 Posted 26/10/2023 at 09:16:41\n124 Posted 26/10/2023 at 09:23:54\nIt's also been reported on these pages that the issue concerns the reported transfer of a single player (Dele Alli?) and also that it is an issue of taxes.\nI have also read, but I don't know the source, somewhere on TW though, that the issue concerns VAT.\nNow putting 2 and 2 together and coming up with 5, I'm speculating that it possibly has to do with the treatment of VAT on the Dele Alli transfer that has been brought to light by an inspection of our accounts compared to Spurs accounts.\nMaybe the two clubs have reported (or not reported) the VAT on the transfer in a different manner and thus raised doubts?\n125 Posted 26/10/2023 at 09:36:21\nThe lying, cheating, prima donna footballers. The obscene amounts of money (both dark and bloodstained) involved. The hypocrisy and corruption of the football authorities. Bent refs, VAR, weird kick-off times to satisfy overseas markets etcâ€¦\nPlastic flags waved by plastic fans taking selfies. Inane punditry 24/7 by former players who can barely string two sentences together. Journalists who spread rumours to satisfy their paymasters (the richer clubs) rather than inform the public.\nI could go on but it's too exhausting and soul-destroying. The game I loved is dead. This commercial monster has no soul. It's fixed, rigged and corrupt from top to bottom and in its present form we have no chance of ever returning to competing at the top end.\n126 Posted 26/10/2023 at 09:36:41\nHowever, I wouldn't put it past the Premier League to make an example out of us with some sort of points deduction.\nBut I can guarantee the same charges applied to any of the Top 6 at the moment would not result in the same penalty.\nThe Premier League is corrupt and they are complicit in looking after the best clubs in the league to not kill their golden goose.\nEverton? We're a big enough club to be made an example of but not important enough to them to look after.\n127 Posted 26/10/2023 at 09:57:06\n128 Posted 26/10/2023 at 10:45:27\nYour last paragraph is absolutely spot on.\n129 Posted 26/10/2023 at 10:52:29\nOf course, I don't expect an answer but I suggest as a group we all start to become keyboard warriors at this incredibly precarious time in our club's history.\nListening to ToffeeTV last night, discussing this issue, I agree we need to start being more vocal before they get away with making us the whipping boys.\nI suspect this story came from a leak. If so, why?? And how disgraceful it was leaked during our so-called independent commission. Someone within the Premier League should be accountable.\nIf it wasn't a leak, how disgraceful to print the story and the journalist should be made accountable.\nOf course, neither would happen but we still need to make our voices heard\nWe should be shouting louder â€“ but always with reason and dignity.\n130 Posted 26/10/2023 at 11:21:26\nI agree with the earlier comment. A possible purpose of the leak, assuming it is, could be to test the waters.\nLet's make the waters a bit more choppy â€“ again I'm not recommending abuse, as we then lose all credibility; even though it's hard not to be.\nThe other clubs may be looking on optimistically but really if they had any sense they would be looking on with fear and support us.\nThough they may be right in thinking we are the only ones who will recieve such punishment. I can just hear them now â€“ Man City had more charges but they weren't as severe as Everton's.\nOf course we still don't know what exactly we've been charged with, let alone our punishment. That in itself is suspect to me along with this independent commission being so closed.\n131 Posted 26/10/2023 at 11:35:25\nI couldn't agree more, even apart from football issues and Everton of course. People in this country do not complain enough to the relevant 'authorities' (? a joke more often than not, calling them that) but will have a good moan (verbally) between each other.\n132 Posted 26/10/2023 at 11:37:58\nHere is their contact email:\ninfo@premierleague.com\nDoes anyone else remember the army of pundits stating, in the wake of the would-be European Super League 'Big 6' breakaway conspiracy, that 'you can't dock the teams points, because that punishes the fans' ?\nLet's see if that philosophy is applied to us if we are found culpable.\nUpdate: I have just sent them a polite message. We should deluge them.\n133 Posted 26/10/2023 at 12:07:20\nBut the game is different now due to the huge amounts of money sloshing about the Premier League. The top clubs, often backed by sovereign wealth funds, can sign the best players not only from Britain but from the whole world. And the top clubs hoover up all the talent in order to earn even more money from the Champions League. Now of course they have pulled up the drawbridge so no-one else can join their club.\nAlso, the standard of refereeing is in my opinion a lot worse, and the refs seem to have half an eye on not upsetting the powers that be. It seems that clubs outside the Top 6 or so have almost no chance of competing, notwithstanding Leicester's \"miracle\" of a few years ago.\n134 Posted 26/10/2023 at 12:08:18\nYou hit the nail on the head. That's exactly how I have felt for the last few years. I thought watching non-league football would be better. It was for a while, but TBH, I don't enjoy the sport itself anymore. Strange.\nDaniel @126,\nTotally agree. It really is all about the Sky favourites and has been for a long time now. The rest of the Premier League (and other clubs) just complete the fixture list.\n135 Posted 26/10/2023 at 12:18:43\nI remember that there were plenty of withering voices just before the Premier League began, saying that the money was going to kill football â€“ and they were proven right in fairly short order.\n136 Posted 26/10/2023 at 12:22:59\n137 Posted 26/10/2023 at 12:26:43\nEverton don't have any powerful advocates and certainly couldn't afford an expensive lawsuit in the current circumstances, therefore, it's easier for the media to highlight the case against our club, whilst simultaneously keeping Manchester City's charges in the headlines.\nAnyway, here's a link to the Daily Mail's latest piece.\n138 Posted 26/10/2023 at 12:30:18\n139 Posted 26/10/2023 at 12:41:51\nI remember in the mid-90s having conversations with friends about why we'd struggle to get rid of Vinny Samways as he was on circa £7k a week. We continually said the bubble would burst.\nIt never has. More money keeps rolling in.\nThere's always been a hierarchy in the Premier League. We've just never been anywhere near it. Even when we regularly finished Top 5 or 6, there wasn't a \"Big 6\".\nMan City forced their way in for obvious reasons and Spurs have just been accommodated due to finances and Champions League qualification.\n140 Posted 26/10/2023 at 12:46:58\n141 Posted 26/10/2023 at 12:47:47\nIf not, we could start a new league with Man City, Nottm Forest, Newcastle Utdâ€¦ no doubt Leeds Utd and Luton Town will want in.\nIt's that old age case of when something gets too big it starts to break up, and the Premier League is far too big. I know, it's all a bit tongue-in-cheekâ€¦ but, if you shake the can enough, the top comes off.\n142 Posted 26/10/2023 at 12:50:17\n143 Posted 26/10/2023 at 12:55:06\nI don't know what I have more fear for, the possible sanctions, or the bit at the end when they talk about 777 about to takeover.\nProbably the latter.\n144 Posted 26/10/2023 at 13:01:42\nLike the Suffragettes â€“ Make More Noise... subtly.\nThank you for taking up my suggestion as well... my inbox is still awaiting their response.\n145 Posted 26/10/2023 at 13:12:44\nThe Premier League said: “In accordance with Premier League Rule W.82.1, the Premier League confirms that it has today referred an alleged breach of the League's Profitability and Sustainability Rules by Everton Football Club to a Commission under Premier League Rule W.3.4. The assessment period for which it is alleged that the Club is in breach is the period ending Season 2021/22. “Commissions are independent of the Premier League and member clubs. The members of the Commission will be appointed by the independent Chair of the Premier League Judicial Panel, in accordance with Premier League Rules W.19, W.20 and W.26. “The proceedings before the Commission will, in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82, be confidential and heard in private. Under Premier League Rule W.82.2, the Commission's final award will be published on the Premier League's website. The League will be making no further comment until that time.â€\n146 Posted 26/10/2023 at 13:17:16\nIn 1963, Tony Kay was jailed for 4 months, fined £150 (a fortune then) and banned from football for life.\nNewcastle's Sandro Tonali has been banned for paltry 10 months for the same crime!!! Despicable Premier League and its filthy lucre standards.\n147 Posted 26/10/2023 at 13:25:42\nFacts for FFP sanctions and penalties: Man City have kicked its case into the long grass. Evidence is supposedly the reason for adjournments. At issue is evidence has been presented by the Premier League and Man City probably are adjourning and doing limited disclosure of its evidence.\nEverton: The remedy is a Tribunal appeal and then Judicial Review for stupid sanctions like Penalty for 12 point deduction. Judicial Review: abuse of power (ultra vires) and conflict of interest as Everton are working with the Premier League.\nI also found a Cambridge University paper online, which builds on my legal knowledge.\n148 Posted 26/10/2023 at 13:31:33\nIf memory serves, Kay, Swan and Lane only bet on one game. Toney and Tonali bet on many games. Even Sturridge was betting or passing information relating to matches to a relative.\nNow, Tonali plays for a club that's owned by Saudi royaltyâ€¦â€¦I'm surprised he got 10 months.\n149 Posted 26/10/2023 at 13:45:55\nI have added it to the email Forwarded, to the Premier League, I'm no Wordsworth but felt they should not be remaining silent, at least over the article.\nDear Sir/Madam,\nI am writing to you on a delicate matter and would like to know the answer.\nYesterday, the Telegraph ran an article on the Premier League demanding a 12-point deduction on Everton Football Club, the very day Everton lost their Chairman, the timing could not be more disrespectful.\nIf this has been leaked to the newspaper from someone within the Premier League, then why have you not investigated who leaked the details, when it could give an unfair influence to the board panel, deciding the outcome.\nIf you are confident that no leak has been made, then why are you remaining silent, and not making a comment to say no one has leaked any information, and letting the press print what they like, without yourselves speaking out, denying the press allegations would at least be a start, if someone however has leaked the information from within the Premier League, then that is a serious breech of hampering and influencing the Independent hearing.\nAs proud members of the Premier League, you need to look further into this, as it cannot be right, to publish an article, in the middle of a hearing.\nYou owe it to every single football fan, to speak out about the article, and where the press got their information from, if it is a made-up story, then you need to clear your name and speak out about the article, and strongly deny the information came from the Premier League and that you carried out the below accordingly\nThe Premier League said: “In accordance with Premier League Rule W.82.1, the Premier League confirms that it has today referred an alleged breach of the League's Profitability and Sustainability Rules by Everton Football Club to a Commission under Premier League Rule W.3.4.

The members of the Commission will be appointed by the independent Chair of the Premier League Judicial Panel, in accordance with Premier League Rules W.19, W.20 and W.26.\n“The proceedings before the Commission will, in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82, be confidential and heard in private. Under Premier League Rule W.82.2, the Commission's final award will be published on the Premier League's website. The League will be making no further comment until that time.\nYours sincerely\n150 Posted 26/10/2023 at 13:47:54\nThe worst of it is, that this attitude regrettably leads to the situation that we find ourselves in, because we tried to keep up with organisations whose means and management capabilities are way beyond ours.\nWhen you think that our benefactor, whose wealth is reputedly in excess of £2 billion, still makes us one of the poorest clubs in the Premier League, despite the fact that he has ploughed £800M into the club, tells you all you need to know about the modern game.\nI long for a manager of a medium-ranking club to come out after a game and say that he has just resigned so that he can honestly and without fear of reprisals, call out the corrupt and incompetent officials who have just cost his club 3 points.\nIt won't be long before all football records prior to 1992 are deleted from the history books and fans are banned from singing songs that refer to past glories.\nAt least that way Haaland can be the best striker ever and Chelsea and Man City can have a better record than we do.\nAs I write, the press campaign continues unabated. I've just read some crap showing the Premier League table if we are deducted 3, 6, 9 and 12 points.\n151 Posted 26/10/2023 at 13:53:23\n152 Posted 26/10/2023 at 13:58:25\nHe's been banned by the Italian football federation, so I guess they have different rules to us.\nI agree that it should be a FIFA decision, and not a particular country's decision, so for once, we can't blame the Premier League for this.\n153 Posted 26/10/2023 at 14:01:58\nMoney was made available but it was misspent and mismanaged, as was the clubs running on a daily basis.\nBrighton have achieved much more than us on a lot less money in a shorter period of time, that comes from people with vision and a plan.\n154 Posted 26/10/2023 at 14:06:53\nLet's say I want to get a case into court. The main thing on my mind is what is my opponent going to do if or when I make an application to court (litigation)?\nLet's assume there is a particular type of narrative against a parent already existing, I would try to change that narrative by looking for evidence or trying to obtain evidence from the local authority insofar as doing it gradually.\nI will tailor an email and, hoping to not alert the opponent that I have court in mind, anticipating that the judge will not likely do blanket disclosure.\nEverton in contrast seem to me to not be attempting to change the \"hate Everton\" narrative. Why have they left it so late?? Maybe Everton has been on the ball hitherto, though right now it doesn't seem that way.\n155 Posted 26/10/2023 at 14:08:27\nThere is is no conspiracy, we are a badly run football club who have broken the rules.\nWe have made a mess of things, lost too much money and must now take our medicine.\nI'm sick of this victim's mentality we seem to have. If we get a 12-point deduction, we'll have to get on with it, if it means we are relegated, then we will have to deal with it.\n156 Posted 26/10/2023 at 14:18:37\nAllison Brittain is the Chair of the Premier League.\n157 Posted 26/10/2023 at 14:19:37\nI suppose, if you were one of the supporters of the clubs who wanted to sue Everton, because their clubs got relegated, you might think that the Premier League's referral is tokenism to protect one of their own?\n158 Posted 26/10/2023 at 14:20:59\nThey know all about us and are now looking for a clear and deliberate breach while I believe City's supposed breach is in sponsoring themselves which is in the guise of their other owned companies.\nIf anyone knows better then please correct me.\n159 Posted 26/10/2023 at 14:44:14\nIf we get the punishment it will be for being monumentally thick. It is the culmination of pretending to have lots of money when we didn't really and spending what we had on premium cost cack.\nI thought no club would be quite so stupid after what Ridsdale did to destroy Leeds â€“ but we managed to take stupid to a new level.\n160 Posted 26/10/2023 at 14:45:29\nTrying to assemble the pieces here:\n\"Why have they left it so late??\"\nWhat have they left so late? The entire timeline is dictated by the Premier League.\nOr responding to the 'hate Everton' narrative? I don't think that's ever going to happen.\n161 Posted 26/10/2023 at 14:52:29\nI also think the Commission has pressure to look for adverse sanction, for instance, threats for a 12-point deduction are not just circumstantial, as this is all probably from Premier League and intervenor parties PL teams counsel, barrister/ top counsels: Premier League teams use various incorporated companies and these are likely Intervenor and submissions likely to be made to influence the KC counsel judge.\nRef Mick at 155:\nIn terms of corruption, you would be surprised what goes on in secret. I can only speak of my knowledge, but let me just say, judges are swapped left, right and centre. There is a clear Everton prejudice as the media narratives are not just implicit but are explicit concerning that.\nIn the legal world, I have come to know, money is exchanged for services rendered, as judges should be appointed independent and in advance: Article 6 Right to a Fair Trial at principle Equality of Arms (See Council of Europe at Article 6 Guide). Council of Europe is the major human rights organisation behind 46 countries' human rights law.\n162 Posted 26/10/2023 at 15:07:14\nTime to let these people know the strength of feeling among us Evertonians.\n163 Posted 26/10/2023 at 15:10:11\n164 Posted 26/10/2023 at 15:11:20\nI won't hold my breath but hope to hear that several employees' and journalists' positions have become untenable.\n165 Posted 26/10/2023 at 15:22:45\nRef: Narrative.\nThe media concerning Everton and FFP situation seems to be that are our club have only recently submitted a defence to FFP sanction whereas City by analogy apparently focused on its submissions of evidence to tremendously delay its FFP sanctions matter.\nWith a caveat I obviously do not know Everton's strategy, the media have reported City's and Everton's approaches in that City successfully delayed proceedings against and Everton have submitted a defence and or will \"robustly defend\".\nEverton in my view, I think, may have been set up by Premier League (vicariously by Premier League team Intervenors) to 'work with the Premier League' insofar as being too open with disclosure.\nAt the beginning of a case, each party as a rule has a duty to disclose evidence (Civil Procedure Rules, 1998 as amended). But of course, arguments can for limited disclosure limit all evidence and thus the case.\nThere are relevant situations such as privileged disclosure and in some case non-disclosure or propionate disclosure in case law. It just seems to me that Everton were slow on the uptake to control the narrative. By narrative, I mean the facts that are interpreted subjectively to party advantage.\n166 Posted 26/10/2023 at 15:27:47\nYou are 100% right â€” it is all about the narrative. Everton are allowing the Premier League narrative to dominate by seeming to accept it. Once you accept the original narrative and do not provide an alternative narrative in your interests, the original narrative becomes the facts and the agenda of the proceedings.\nI learned this in Proceedings 20 years ago. My daughter has just had a successful conclusion in her case. We constantly fought and did not accept the other partie's narrative. My experience that is the Legal profession are close to the facts that they appear not to know. It takes you to know yourself and brief your legal representatives accordingly, trying to get your narrative across. The press titbits being released are an attempt by parties to control the narrative.\nInterestly 777 Partners constantly challenge the narrative. They never let any bad news to be left, without a countering reply. This was a hallmark of all the Presidential Campaigns of Clinton. Constantly challenge the existing narrative.\nEven in my posts throughout this case, even before the Commission announcement, I have put forward an alternative narrative.\n167 Posted 26/10/2023 at 15:37:32\nI'll be adding to the emails myself. The more the better!\nAs you've done, Barry, we need to ask, if it was a leak what actions are being taken? And if it wasn't, why are they not clarifying their position?\nThis should not be happening whilst a tribunal taking place.\nLet alone the disrespect of such an article to a club in mourning.\n168 Posted 26/10/2023 at 15:44:21\nBrilliant news that her lawyers learnt eventually to control the narrative. To do this it requires clever use of wording to persuade and accompanied by referring to evidence from the beginning.\nThe judge doesn't want to reinvent the wheel when it comes to facts as everything is subject to time and advocates meetings determine the outcome before going into the hearings.\nThe middle-class culture is that professionals that work together do not like being scrutinised, and for those reasons, final hearing for examination of evidence is usually soft or excuses made, which the judge accepts, legal aid cases where experts instead answer limited questions.\n(NB: *is Aware the number of posts should be fair and proportionate, directed to TW admin).\n170 Posted 26/10/2023 at 15:54:46\nI copied the Guardian in suggesting the breach of confidentiality should be a story they need to investigate in its own right.\n171 Posted 26/10/2023 at 16:06:07\nAdd to that the situation that we always simply accept decisions with barely any complaint. Unlike Man City, we simply handed over the books on demand. Complete pussies, perfect for demonstrating to the government that the Premier League can keep their own house in order without government intervention by way of imposing swingeing sanctions on an alleged transgressor.\nI posted at the beginning of the season that the target had to be a minimum 52 points based on 40 to stay up, plus a possible 12-point deduction, and that we needed 15 points from the first 9 games. I was roundly criticised by some on here who said there's no such sanction as a 12-point deduction. Well, there seems to be one now and, sadly, we have fallen well short of the 9-game target.\nAdd to that one of our principal witnesses regarding the Premier League's assurances that we were okay is now dead. Who is representing us before this anonymous secret independent commission?\nAn appeal to the Premier League is pointless. Everyone involved is paid by them and he who calls the piper calls the tune. We should really piss them off by going to the Court for Arbitration for Sport, which is independent of the Premier League and its cronies. I said we should have done this when Lampard was fined £80k for telling the truth, by presenting a case showing the systematic bias in favour of certain clubs, both on and off the field.\nWe should also write to all MPs demanding action be taken by the government to ensure that the running of football in the UK is fair and balanced. That will worry them far more.\nNone of the above in any way absolves those responsible for the appalling running of our club. It's just that we need to show that we are being picked on for a single offence when far more obvious targets for financial transgressions exist.\nps: Anyone who thinks that making an example of us will result in any Sky 6 club being sanctioned under P&S rules is living on Fantasy Island. After destroying us to make their point, they will simply 'reinterpret' or change the rules to protect the so-called Big 6 and the 100+ charges against Man City will eventually disappear (see the European Super League breakaway) â€“ eg, How many of their players have been sent off for simulation?\n172 Posted 26/10/2023 at 16:07:47\nIf as reported it's about treatment of tax, surely that would be pretty quickly resolved. They saw what we reported so how long does it take to explain it? 10 minutes? An hour if you produce a few examples of precedent?\nSurely this should be a pretty quick and easy case. So when do we hear the outcome?\n173 Posted 26/10/2023 at 16:10:53\nThat is a great summary if we were talking about a level playing field, which we are not. Everton, as I understand it, have been charged with one breach covering one accounting period. All of Everton's interests are subject to UK corporate law, whether this be the Group or the wholly owned subsidiaries making up that Group.\nManchester City's breaches cover six years and involve more complex matters such as self-sponsorship, over-valuing sponsorship deals and off-book payments.\nThe other confusing factor is that, by and large, the accounts filed by Manchester City Ltd contain an apportioned revenue from the City Football Group, which is a holding company registered in the UAE and is owned by three organisations; 78% is owned by Abu Dhabi United Group, 18% by the American firm Silver Lake, and 4% by Chinese firms China Media Capital and CITIC Capital.\nAbu Dhabi United Group is a Private Equity Company wholly owned by Sheikh Mansour. For the last few years City Football Group has been managed by Newton Investment and Development LLC, another company wholly owned by Sheikh Mansour.\nCity Group comprises 13 football clubs around the world and 4 women's teams, the likelihood of the Premier League ever being able to find their way through the morass is virtually non-existent and since the accounts for Manchester City Ltd have been accepted by Companies House, it will be many years yet before this matter is resolved. Charges have been brought now to avoid several years 'dropping out' from possible investigation.\n174 Posted 26/10/2023 at 16:30:24\nI'd rather be in the Football League if so, and if the club are found guilty.\nThe Premier League is nothing short of a disgrace and no doubt we'll get docked points.\nIf the Premier League don't impose it, the refs will do their bit to see us down.\nMan City will backhand millions and get away with it.\n175 Posted 26/10/2023 at 16:30:57\nI might have to wait a long time for an answer!\n176 Posted 26/10/2023 at 16:31:12\nNow if the auditors approved it, then the treatment must be legit?\nMy understanding is that any stadium costs can be capitalized and therefore are not a profit and loss item so hopefully this is the case and we will be cleared.\n177 Posted 26/10/2023 at 16:39:41\nLosses, I know, that have been put down to Covid but which \"appear\" to be way in excess of what could reasonably be accounted for.\n178 Posted 26/10/2023 at 16:54:53\nGrammar and words are her thing and I never realised how important they were until I seen her phrase and answer e-mails. She was able to capitalise on poor English and grammer at every opportunity.\nMy father, who worked in a legal office for two years after he left school, was brilliant at English as well. I did not inherit the trait, as can be seen in my posts.\n179 Posted 26/10/2023 at 17:14:44\nIf we went down through poor form in isolation, the ignominy might be too much for many. I suspect some will simply wash their hands of what has become a disaster club with ongoing decline and empty seats a real prospect for the new gaffe.\nIf we must drop, this is the way to do it.\n#everycloud\n180 Posted 26/10/2023 at 17:35:22\nYour daughter will be most disappointed that you spelt the word 'grammar' incorrectly. :)\n181 Posted 26/10/2023 at 17:51:40\nIn your country... not in mine! ;-))\n182 Posted 26/10/2023 at 17:54:29\nAny disagreements, any different point of views have been put to one side and the fans are all as one.\nToo many times now, our football club has been kicked, cheated, laughed upon, been used as an example.\nEnough is enough, we need to all stick together on this one, and not take any more dirt dished out.\nThe Premier League and media have poked the bear once too often, it's time for us all to unite, fight back, and say we are not standing for it anymore.\nOur emails may come to nothing, but to release something, while the independent commission is taking place is not on.\nWe were all warned not to post anything about the Hillsborough trial a few years back, on any social platforms, as it could hamper or sway the case.\nThere is no difference here, and whoever leaked the information should be accounted for.\nRant over.\n183 Posted 26/10/2023 at 18:03:10\nHere! Here!\n184 Posted 26/10/2023 at 18:03:27\nI'm not sure Everton have had much opportunity to control the narrative beyond preparing and presumably presenting their defence as and when required before the presumably ongoing independent commission (although it might now have actually finished its work) â€“ all in private behind closed doors.\nGiven the private and confidential nature of the entire process, that suits the internal machinations of the club, which would say absolutely nothing until the Premier League publishes the commission's findings on their website.\nWhile everyone is keen to indulge in 'whataboutery' over Man City, Everton's relatively simple single-issue case is being dealt with in accordance with the Premier League timetable, as announced â€“ and completely controlled â€“ by them.\nWhat's annoying is that the mischievous Telegraph article could have been written without any Premier League source. In essence, it is pure speculation. Yet it's been picked up, hook, line and sinker, by every news outlet in the country and beyond, with everyone believing it has come from the Premier League. Such is the power of a couple of hacks.\n185 Posted 26/10/2023 at 18:06:42\nâ€˜Was it Wilde or Shaw?' The answer appears to be: both. In The Canterville Ghost (1887), Wilde wrote: â€˜We have really everything in common with America nowadays except, of course, language'. However, the 1951 Treasury of Humorous Quotations (Esar & Bentley) quotes Shaw as saying: â€˜England and America are two countries separated by the same language', but without giving a source. The quote had earlier been attributed to Shaw in Reader's Digest (November 1942).\n186 Posted 26/10/2023 at 18:17:06\nhttps://twitter.com/ToffeeTVEFC/status/1717566539782570165/photo/1\n187 Posted 26/10/2023 at 18:25:26\n188 Posted 26/10/2023 at 18:31:27\nFair point.\nIt would appear that in this instance \"no news is bad news\". If Everton have done nothing wrong one would assume that a Premier League statement exonerating the club will appear fairly quickly.\nIf this drags on for a few days I would worry we have been found to have broken the rules and the Independent Commission need a few more days to determine if it was a genuine error or an actual attempt to mislead. Obviously this will impact any likely punishment.\n189 Posted 26/10/2023 at 18:32:05\n1) No.\n2) It's the Premier League, not the FA.\n190 Posted 26/10/2023 at 18:52:22\nThe auditors are certainly required to sign off the publicly available accounts.\nThe Profitability & Sustainability figure, however, is a further calculation which takes the overall profit/loss figure and adjusts it for disallowable expense â€“ covid items, women's and youth football etc.\nI'm not sure if this calculation is actually audited. I suspect as it's not part of the statutory accounts, it may not be.\n192 Posted 26/10/2023 at 19:09:17\n'In the case of a determination at a hearing the Commission's decision shall be announced as soon as practicable thereafter and if possible at the end of the hearing' â€“ given it's a single charge we shouldn't be waiting long.\nIn terms of outcomes if found guilty, if you put Portsmouth going into administration at one end of a scale (9 points) with innocent at the other end, where would this offence rank? In those terms -12 wouldn't just be harsh, it'd be completely inappropriate.\n193 Posted 26/10/2023 at 19:22:31\nRef per quoted, there are also interim remedies available in law generally, and interim remedy could have been interim sanctioning against Man City and employing penalties such as penalty points and or excessive fines.\"\nThe fact that the Premier League have evidence to bring charges against City, and I thought it was longer than 6 years, there should be evidence for interim sanctions. There is either evidence for sanctions or not, whether there is more evidence to go through should not alter interim remedies.\nIt is for probably avoiding statutory barring that proceedings are brought against City. It just seems to me City have challenged using legal technicalities, as a possible distraction.\nIt does seem unfair if City is given plenty of latitude but Everton are dragged over the coals for something relatively trivial, relative to City's controversial facts. Everton, I think, should raise a precedent as it impedes the public law principles, implied or explicit bias and or unfair treatment.\nTreaty of Functioning of the European Union's legal principle is proportionality and should apply to Everton. Brexit is not relevant as EU law is still applicable in several areas, notwithstanding UK Competition law is already developed from European Union case law.\n\"Manchester City's breaches cover six years and involve more complex matters such as self-sponsorship, over-valuing sponsorship deals and off-book payments.\nThe other confusing factor is that, by and large, the accounts filed by Manchester City Ltd contain an apportioned revenue from the City Football Group, which is a holding company registered in the UAE and is owned by three organisations; 78% is owned by Abu Dhabi United Group, 18% by the American firm Silver Lake, and 4% by Chinese firms China Media Capital and CITIC Capital.\nAbu Dhabi United Group is a Private Equity Company wholly owned by Sheikh Mansour.

Luckily this time I can argue that it is the American spelling as Mike pointed out. Though I didn't know.\n203 Posted 26/10/2023 at 23:25:00\nI hope your interpretation is right, since it may pre-empt the decision and influence it positively.\nI also think that the Premier League is getting a taster of the possible reaction if the punishment appears to be disproportionate, when compared with them appearing to drag their heels. even if the reason is City working the system.\n204 Posted 26/10/2023 at 00:03:55\nAlison Brittain resigns due to several polite emails.\n[I'm obviously joking!]\n205 Posted 26/10/2023 at 00:17:40\nMoshiri has surely known what's coming and is desperate to sell in order to claw back as much as possible.\nI read the other day that Usmanov has cut Moshiri out of all his business interests and demanded he gets his money back and the only way that may happen is if the club is sold.\nSomeone said to me that part of our defense would be including the naming rights and sponsorship money being refunded to Usmanov, but that was only £30 million, how the fuck can the rest of the deficit be explained?\nI think it is very likely we will get a points deduction and transfer ban to match. People saying relegation might just be what we need in order to regroup and sort us out, not for me â€“ I want to stay in the Premier League and make them fucking sick.\nIt is all very disheartening with what has happened to us.\n206 Posted 27/10/2023 at 01:28:52\nYou're conflating two different things. Obviously Everton's Covid related losses are laughable. But seemingly that's not what we are in trouble for. We are under the microscope for treatment of taxation related to the stadium.\nIt's like Al Capone. Everyone knows he was a gangster but the charge he faced was tax evasion. The fact we made a mockery of P&S is irrelevant as somehow no one charged us for that.\n207 Posted 27/10/2023 at 08:44:42\n208 Posted 27/10/2023 at 09:44:20\n“If you don't throw the book at them, then what kind of message is going to be sent out?â€\nWe don't even know the charge, he hasn't seen the evidence or heard the arguments, the independent commission hasn't adjudicated. How is he coming to that point of view?\nThen Simon Jordan is saying the Premier League's presentation didn't go too well last week, but has since improved.\nWho is leaking information to him and why? Any information broadcast will influence the mass media's coverage, like the Telegraph article did. This could well have an influence directly or subliminally on the persons sitting on the independent commission. It could alter their way of thinking.\nThese leaks have to stop or the hearing will become tainted and worthless in the eyes of many. Also possibly open up legal action against any findings.\n209 Posted 27/10/2023 at 09:45:11\nAt least it's an unbiased organisation. ;)\n210 Posted 27/10/2023 at 10:00:49\nI'm not concerned about the independent commission being influenced by the media because I'm sure that they will draw their own conclusions on the merits of the case. That might be naive of me, but we have to have some trust that people know their responsibilities and are capable of evaluating the evidence without being influenced by outside pressure.\nWhat the Telegraph article has shown is that any old rubbish can appear in a report, tweet or blog and it is then amplified by the rest of the media, without anybody seemingly stopping to check the validity of the information, to such an extent that TalkSport et al can discuss it live on air, adding nothing factual or new to the original story.\nThis media frenzy then leads to fans of other clubs believing that the Premier League has made a decision, that Everton are guilty as charged, and if they then at some later date, hear that the decision is different to the rumour started by the Telegraph, they will be up in arms screaming 'injustice' and 'fix'.\nThis 'outrage' will thereby generate even more column inches and interminable views and arguments from the 'shock jocks'.\nPop will eat itself, but the media will devour everything in its path, unless it starts to apply some journalistic integrity and basic checking of the stories based on phantom sources that it publishes.\n211 Posted 27/10/2023 at 10:02:04\nWith Manchester City, Chelsea and Nottingham Forest all awaiting the outcome of charges or investigations, surely a 12-point deduction for Everton opens a massive Pandora's Box.\n212 Posted 27/10/2023 at 10:12:40\nThey tried it with a series of suspect VAR decisions over the last few years and when that hasn't worked, they're jumping all over us about things they don't even look twice at for other clubs.\nThis kind of punishment would be far too much, even if what we are being accused of is true. You have to remember that it is one single rule we have fallen foul of as I understand and we are facing just one charge to answer.\nThere is no way a massive points deduction is warranted for that â€“ but you can just tell the people in charge of the Premier League have been waiting for even the slightest chance to nobble us.\nIt just stinks to high heaven â€“ I can't believe we are the only club currently or in the last few years who have fallen foul of what we are being accused of. But as usual, they ignore it with everyone else and throw the book at us when they get chance.\nDo you think Man City will get any kind of similar sanction for their hundreds of rule breaches? Of course not - it will just be a slap on the wrist, a fine and a 'don't do it again'.\nIt's like when they tried to stamp out diving and it was only an Everton player in Niasse who ever got pulled up for it.\nIf I was in charge of the club, I would take legal action back against the Premier League and sue them for points/revenue lost due to the long list of obvioulsy wrong refeering and VAR decisions which have gone against us in the last few seasons. See how they like those eggs.\nModern football is a joke and I suspect corrupt as anything. You only have to look at the ridiculous refeering and VAR decisions every week to see that. They can't geniuinely be getting so many decisions so wrong every week in most games. Especially when they usually favour the 'bigger' sides and get the Premier League the results they obviously want.\n213 Posted 27/10/2023 at 10:45:45\nPreparing the case for Man City's 115 charges will prove a longer process, therefore Everton present an easy, timely and symbolic example that the Premier League can advance. It also helps that the club is so passive in its response to all events on and off the field compared to the Red Shite, for example.\nThe Premier League are demanding a 12-point penalty to demonstrate their robustness but, if the one charge does relate to treatment of taxation on stadium costs, then they may not succeed.\nNot sure that phases them too much. They will have made their point that an independent regulator is not needed and shown their determination. They can then cite the independent commission as the reason they were thwarted.\n214 Posted 27/10/2023 at 11:02:20\nWho said the Premier League are demanding a 12-point penalty against Everton?\n215 Posted 27/10/2023 at 11:04:27\nI still can't see the fact that Everton worked alongside the Premier League monitoring for 2 years and seemed to be taking decisions throughout to try and remedy the situation, not counting towards any decision.\nAnyway, someone is playing silly buggers at the moment.\n216 Posted 27/10/2023 at 11:55:57\nI agree with everything you say and it is time for the club to look at taking legal action. We have committed one very stupid mistake and have been under restriction now for 3 seasons which has seen us nearly relegated.\nOther clubs deliberately tried to form a new competition behind the Premier League's back. A far bigger crime without any doubt.\nLike what's been said earlier, we need to change the narrative. Imagine if this was Liverpool, their response would be to be all over it. Totally indignant, on the attack and threatening to take all sorts of action.\n217 Posted 27/10/2023 at 11:56:34\nMy hunch is that the Premier League's oversight of Everton was relatively low-key. If, as some people seem to believe, the Premier League were effectively running Everton's finances for two years there would not be, could not be this charge.\nThe Premier League may have been receiving details of Everton's ongoing finances for the period but they weren't drilling down into it.\n218 Posted 27/10/2023 at 12:03:17\nBut leak looked pretty well co-ordinated to me.\n219 Posted 27/10/2023 at 12:38:32\nUnfortunately, unless Everton take it further should the independent commission find against them and the penalty is found harsh and unacceptable, then there will be nobody to make sense of any of it. Does this sound similar to where the other club in this conversation has taken matters?\nUnfortunately for us, we don't have owners used to getting their own way or perhaps even know who that might be in the near future if this whole thing deters any interested parties.\n220 Posted 27/10/2023 at 12:58:29\nLittle ole plucky Everton will be a nice sacrificial lamb as a warning to anyone who dares to dream big to keep in line.\nAs for the Premier League poster boys, Man City and Haaland, Chelsea, Man Utd and the rest of the FFP flaunters: Well, I think they are all more concerned about their player stats on the new game of FIFA Football than any charges from the Premier League.\nThe Premier League is a billion-pound business and they won't go for the teams that help sell that product. It makes good business sense for the Premier League to allow a team to assume dominance over world football like Man City have as it improves and enhances the overall Premier League product. The best team in world football plays in the English Premier League.\nAll fans know that a VAR check is simply reference to a safety net for a Top 6 badge check.\nWe will pathetically and quietly take our punishment as that is the Everton way.\n221 Posted 27/10/2023 at 13:21:34\nHowever, the damage it is doing is not. The wailing and handwringing over allegations that aren't proven is unbelievable.\nEvertonians are buying into gutter press allegations that aren't worth a carrot and perpetuating the narrative they are spewing out.\nI wish everyone would calm down and wait for the independent commission to come to their own conclusions and not continue to fan the flames of deceitful allegations.\n222 Posted 27/10/2023 at 13:30:14\nMy worry is Everton may not have declared everything they should have done, either on purpose or unwittingly.\nI suspect this, though far more nuanced, will be the basis on which they at one stage seemed to be supporting our financial submissions, and now suddenly they are not.\n223 Posted 27/10/2023 at 13:32:32\nSome of the nonsense being spouted around the place makes us look like a fanbase of paranoiacs.\n224 Posted 27/10/2023 at 13:32:38\nIndeed if the Telegraph allegation was accurate, the big story here would be that the Premier League is corrupting what is supposed to be an independent process.\nNo news outlet, however, is raising this aspect as an issue because they know the Telegraph article is clickbait lazy journalism at its worst.\nAnd that's also why the Premier League aren't commenting.\n225 Posted 27/10/2023 at 13:48:23\nThe Simon Jordan - Jim White conversation referred to how well things had gone from the first week to the second for the Premier League. By default, he is getting updates on what's being said but, even more importantly was the fact that he said he was told it wasn't going well for the Premier League initially but was better this week.\nThat implies the Premier League are prosecuting a case against Everton and not just laying out the reasons for concern to allow an independent process to arrive at a balanced conclusion.\nDoing so allows the Premier League to look as though they are going for us and looking big whilst losing nothing. So much for a confidential process.\nIf they lose, they can blame the commission, we tried butâ€¦\nIf they win, but it's less of a sanction, they can blame the commission for the details of the judgementâ€¦\nEverton should have publicly condemned the leaks immediately and still should. Otherwise, it would appear to all and sundry they are guilty and throwing themselves onto the mercy of the commissionâ€¦\n226 Posted 27/10/2023 at 14:10:16\nIf they are waiting for every single charge to be investigated, then it will take forever. So as I say, just look at the most serious one, find them guilty, and dish out the punishment.\n227 Posted 27/10/2023 at 14:37:45\nThe leak services that concern by signalling a strong desire for punishment of a club with less stature than Man City. They probably don't realize this highlights the critical problem, going after the big money clubs. It is likely an open secret among the grey suits of the commission and corridors of power.\nRide it out. As long as the Premier League doesn't come in to confirm it may reflect poorly on their capability to regulate. This could ultimately play in our favor. Wait for more information and load up on liquor just in case.\n228 Posted 27/10/2023 at 14:46:17\nI wish I'd listened to the back and forth between Jordan and White, but from the transcript that I've seen, I wouldn't bet on any such leak taking place as Jordan said: 'I understand the Premier League presented last week and they weren't particularly impressive in the first instance. They've [since] gotten a little bit better in their presentation.'\n'So the Premier League present their case and advance their arguments, and Everton will of course rebut the position and establish theirs, and from this will come some degree of consequence.'\nWe don't know where Jordan gained this information, was it via a tea-lady? A cleaner? A security guard? Any other person not at all involved in the hearing? Or was it merely a figment of his furtive imagination.\nJordan may well be mates with somebody within the hearing, in which case, the Premier League should open an investigation into who revealed anything about the hearing as they have stated that 'The proceedings before the Commission will, in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82, be confidential and heard in private.'\nI can see the whole thing hanging over Everton until the end of this season, as this committee is replaced, due to a leak, if such a leak has actually taken place.\n229 Posted 27/10/2023 at 14:50:08\nWhat the hell!\nSome of the nonsense being spouted around the place makes us look like a fanbase of paranoiacs.\nA. We are under investigation for financial irregularities.\nB. The hearing is underway/has concluded.\nC. Rumours of a potential 12-point penalty are rife.\nGiven the above, we are entitled to come on here to discuss this and all the potential ramifications and the overall farcical injustice of it all given that other clubs have and are still to this very day getting away with much much worse.\nParanoia? My fucking arse â€“ the very future of this club hangs on the findings of this investigation.\n230 Posted 27/10/2023 at 14:55:23\n231 Posted 27/10/2023 at 14:57:54\nWhere did you see that?\n232 Posted 27/10/2023 at 15:02:04\n233 Posted 27/10/2023 at 15:07:01\nHe was a friend of Kenwright's and challenged him why he had let Moshiri do the things he did. Kenwright said \"You try telling a billionaire what to do.\"\nHe also quoted Kenwright telling Moshiri who should replace Ancelotti, but was called to a meeting with Moshiri and sitting there was Benitez who had been offered the job.\n234 Posted 27/10/2023 at 15:07:35\nIf the hearing has concluded, is the delay in announcing a decision due to both sides, ie, Everton and the Premier League, considering the outcome and whether or not to trigger the appeals process?\nBrian @234,\nPerhaps Moshiri should approach Simon Jordan to fill the vacant chairman's post as the broadcaster seems to know far more than most about the internal machinations of Everton Football Club.\n235 Posted 27/10/2023 at 15:09:14\n236 Posted 27/10/2023 at 15:34:07\n237 Posted 27/10/2023 at 16:01:35\nSimon Jordan said a few weeks back he would become chairman of Everton if asked. I think he'd do a good job.\n238 Posted 27/10/2023 at 16:07:20\nI also heard that the other lot are claiming back rent from 1892 onwards, as the contract with their original owner, wasn't legally nullified. Plus Old Ma Noblett's descendants have asked the tax authorities to investigate non-payment for hundreds of thousands of Toffees, covering a period of 50 years.\nI just saw a betting organisation have put up a tweet \"Finally FFP Head office taking some strong action\"\n239 Posted 27/10/2023 at 16:13:59\n240 Posted 27/10/2023 at 16:48:41\nI don't think he's the answer to any of our problems.\n241 Posted 27/10/2023 at 17:14:28\nSimon Jordan is not the answer but, to be fair, he has always sided with Everton.\n242 Posted 27/10/2023 at 17:30:57\nNo reply for me either. This is exactly what I expected.\nI am not so naÃ¯ve that I would think that they would jump to answer, the 'info' email is probably under the supervision of someone on work experience.\nThe idea of sending emails is that ultimately we can point to the total lack of cooperation and respect for the fans who are being merely inquisitive. We all know what the Premier League are like, but we need to gather material evidence to demonstrate it.\nI see this as just the first step.\nI don't contribute much or very often to these forums, but I do read them and what I see is a collective of intelligence, knowledge, articulacy and wit. If that is harnessed and given direction, it would tie the Premier League in knots.\nIn the last 24 hours, someone wrote that for Evertonians 'enough is enough'; for me, this is it. We have been used as scapegoats, subjected to abysmal officiating, made guinea pigs for new rules and patronised by the wider media... I have more self respect than to take it anymore.\nA more noble and passionate set of supporters do not exist anywhere else on Earth. Moreover, they have a heritage of knowing the game and how it is played that is not extant at any any other club. They know the highs of triumph, but also the nadir of despair and the unbridled joy of preserving one's status ( something the the Smug 6, will never have to endure...but equally, will never enjoy). The celebrations and support shown during successive relegation battles is unparalleled elsewhere.\nFor me supporters of that calibre should never be treated as badly as they have been either by the poor stewardship of our board, or by the pencil-necked cowards who hide behind any kind of chicanery that purports to run the game.\nWE ALL DESERVE BETTER...AND WE ARE GOING TO GET IT.\n243 Posted 27/10/2023 at 17:43:51\nDixie's goal in the 1933 FA Cup Final has always looked a bit dodgy to me, being honest!\n244 Posted 27/10/2023 at 18:06:51\nVery funny, but many a true thing said in jest.\n245 Posted 27/10/2023 at 18:11:47\nWhat about Andy Gray's goal in the '84 FA Cup Final? Did Steve Sherwood have two hands on the ball when Andy Gray headed it in?\nNo doubt there will be a retrospective decision about that and we will be stripped of the FA Cup, which in turn means we will also lose the Charity Shield of the 84-85 season, and also the Cup-Winners Cup because we shouldn't have been in it!!!\n246 Posted 27/10/2023 at 18:21:18\nSheffield Wednesday to be awarded retrospective cup win.\n247 Posted 27/10/2023 at 18:28:44\nI am only immediately focussed on what is important. We have a match against West Ham that I am attending in less than 48 hours.\nI will be thinking about that more than anything else or media speculation.\n248 Posted 27/10/2023 at 19:04:44\nWell, this is what I found: each team has one vote or share in decision-making, with â…” vote to change the rules. This may not apply to our case except you might think to take such a momentous step to deduct points from one of their members would require a full members meeting?\nThen we step down to the Executive Board with a load of impressive names who seem to have no link to football. The only name I recognized was Richard Masters. Not sure what power this group holds but hopefully they are intelligent people who would not dare to make such a far-reaching decision as a points deduction.\nThen are all the other hangers-on including the FA, UEFA, FIFA and Uncle Tom cobble and all. Again, I have no idea what these stakeholders contribute. According to their website, there are over 250 paid workers. So a pretty large unwieldy body of people.\nSo I am still no further informed of when the media talk of the Premier League recommending a 12-point deduction according to the three journos at the Telegraph, who they are talking about?\n249 Posted 27/10/2023 at 19:14:32\nNo Ornstein, only a reference to the Telegraph story with considerably more time and prose put into the coverage of Bill's passing.\nThe Telegraph story still looks like Premier League positioning for now.\n250 Posted 27/10/2023 at 19:38:52\nYes, positioning is the word.\n251 Posted 27/10/2023 at 19:40:23\nYes, what a cock-up that name was, embarrassing the poor commentators not to mention Eddie Cavanagh encroaching on the hallowed Wembley turf and making a fool of one bizzie after another.\n252 Posted 27/10/2023 at 19:52:39\nThere will be no problem at all if we have recruited Colleen's lawyers.\n253 Posted 27/10/2023 at 19:53:50\n254 Posted 27/10/2023 at 20:00:50\nI hope the tap is exposed and also brought to the dock.\nBeat West Ham, and UTFTs!\n255 Posted 27/10/2023 at 20:04:58\n256 Posted 27/10/2023 at 20:05:27\nBBC must've been in a right state when Catterick pulled that one out a couple of hours before kick off,\nWolstenholme would've been putting more plums in his mouth than he'd ever been used too ..ever.ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚\nDale #253, great shout on that name on the back of a shirt, never ever seen that one, and we all should've by now.\nI'll deffo get that one next time we're at Wembley for a cup final.\n257 Posted 27/10/2023 at 20:29:10\nWhoever they are who Everton may hire for their defence, I hope they rinse them dry, even if the case is adjourned for lack of facts etc, but they then get them for malicious slander and the rest.\n258 Posted 27/10/2023 at 22:43:23\nI think you are buying too much into the narrative about the Premier League overseeing Everton's financials... it was almost certainly a light touch.\nBut you are right... if Everton simply got the complicated P&S regulations wrong we might get off lightly. If we've tried to take the piss... different ending entirely.\nApologies for taking so long to come back to you.\n259 Posted 27/10/2023 at 22:55:14\nI always thought that the Premier League who initially charged Everton would of course lead the prosecution. They made the charge... of course they should prosecute it. If not them, who?\n260 Posted 28/10/2023 at 08:44:41\nMeanwhile, the City appeal rolls on and is disappeared once the right level of backhanders are paid.\nI love the even competitive nature of the Premier League â€”needs renaming to the Rich Boys Auction with trophies available to the highest bidder.\n261 Posted 28/10/2023 at 08:52:30\nPoor taste timing this week as well.\nAt least it's found use as chip paper today or even more if you have an outside bog in the backyard.\n262 Posted 28/10/2023 at 09:17:30\nUnfortunately, with so much scrutiny on how the Premier League administers the game, and with the threat of an independent regulator, the Premier League could be tempted to use the Everton case as an example of how capable the Premier League is of dealing with its own affairs.\nIn the case of Everton the Premier League's integrity is also at stake\nThere is an argument from an Evertonian point of view, that however many points are docked, if they are indeed docked, the Premier League would only be adding to the running deficit, due to the number of points they have informally taken off the club, due to the 'mistakes' of their officials out on the pitch and in the VAR rooms.\n263 Posted 28/10/2023 at 09:26:35\nNow the independent commission has concluded, I just hope that everything remains independent and confidential. Also, it's crucial that the three members are not subjected to any outside influences by way of any communications in any form in the interim.\n264 Posted 28/10/2023 at 10:08:17\nMan City have got 114 more charges against them than we have, so if we get a points deduction, surely an appropriate punishment for City would be to demote them to non-league status!\n265 Posted 28/10/2023 at 10:15:03\nAnd does anybody know if Premier League rules state that any penalty can only be enforced by a majority vote of all clubs or is dispensed in the same way as the penalty for the \"Super League\" clubs?\n266 Posted 28/10/2023 at 10:26:49\nThere have been articles about 12-point deductions, but is it for not paying tax, or running up huge debts years ago?\nI might be ignorant because I have chosen not to read these articles, but I've read a lot of posts on this thread and still can't work out what the actual charge is?\n267 Posted 28/10/2023 at 10:32:12\nI believe. that indeed it is the Commission who decide the case and mete out any punishments that they deem fit, if the accused is found guilty. The Premier League or the club can appeal their decision and the punishment, should they so wish to.\nI don't think that other Premier League clubs have a say in any of the punishments. The 20 clubs all agreed to abide by whatever financial rules are in place, but as far as I know, there is no formal set of punishments in place for the breaking of financial rules.\nTony @266\nThe charge has never been made public - so apart from the club, the Premier League and the Commission, nobody knows for sure, although I think it was Paul Joyce who said it was something to do with tax on a loan assigned to the stadium, that had caused an issue.\n268 Posted 28/10/2023 at 10:32:51\nThe Premier League are analogous to the prosecution and have to prove the case (on a balance of probability). EFC are the respondent (think 'defendant') and the 3-person panel are the judges.\nThe panel is selected from professionals with relevant experience (legal, accounting etc) and they will decide both whether the Premier League have proved their case and what the punishment should be.\nThe punishment is difficult to gauge because they have complete discretion and no obvious reference point. There is an appeals process in the rules too.\n269 Posted 28/10/2023 at 10:33:33\nThe specific nature of the breach Everton have been charged with has not been made public.\nLots of rumours, speculation, leaksâ€¦ but nothing specific.\n270 Posted 28/10/2023 at 10:45:48\n271 Posted 28/10/2023 at 10:46:30\nYou are correct. I haven't seen what the club are being charged with.\nWhy the secrecy? Has the club or the commission decided that they don't want it made public, as they both must know what the charge is for?\nAlso, if reports are correct and the commission have finished their deliberations, why are we having to wait for a few weeks for this to be made public? All seems very strange to me.\n272 Posted 28/10/2023 at 10:49:29\nI don't think anyone has a clue but it relates to the 21/22 season/financial year. Although of course the previous 2 years' losses will also have contributed to us breaching the P&S limit.\nThere was speculation initially that the charge related to a player transfer but that has now been overtaken by a suggestion around tax/VAT in relation to the new stadium.\nI don't think there's any suggestion of Everton not having paid tax â€“ rather that it hasn't been properly accounted for in the books. Possibly Everton have shown something as stadium-related and not to be included in the P&S calculation but in the view of the Premier League it should have been included.\nA lot of speculation on my part of course.\n273 Posted 28/10/2023 at 10:54:13\nWhen you say 'double the next nearest', do you mean £90M more, or £45M? If true, then we're looking at a suspended fine at the most.\n274 Posted 28/10/2023 at 11:04:18\nThe 'secrecy' as you call it is a result of the private and confidential provisions obscuring much or all of the detail from the prying eyes of the public and the press. This was presumably agreed to by the Premier League clubs.\nI imagine the findings of the independent commission will need to be formulated and written up in the form of a quasi-judicial document: \"unless the parties otherwise agree, the Commission shall give its reasons for its decision (a copy of which shall be provided to the Chair of the Judicial Panel).\"\n275 Posted 28/10/2023 at 11:10:03\nI'm not sure if Paul is correct. The charge relates to the 21/22 season and Everton's big Covid claims related to prior seasons. Although there may still have been some Covid impact in 21/22.\nIrrespective of the figure concerned, I imagine the Commission will be equally concerned with the cause of the alleged breach.\nDid Everton make an honest mistake and simply get the P&S regulations wrong? Or was there an attempt to knowingly and willfully mislead?\nI think it's those factors that will influence the punishment as much as the amount of money concerned. Assuming of course that we are found to have done anything wrong.\n276 Posted 28/10/2023 at 11:11:23\n277 Posted 28/10/2023 at 11:21:40\nIf they are not perpetrating lies, then someone is leaking these stories, and surely this would bring the whole process into disrepute, if Everton could find out who is behind these defamatory leaks?\n278 Posted 28/10/2023 at 11:27:26\nFurther to the independent commission preparing its decision in writing, there's a subsequent section of the rules that may yet come into play, and result in yet further delay.\nIt's called \"Interim Applications\".\nNow this appears to get pretty complicated, but I can see it happening from either side, with one or other seeking \"any interim measures, relief or order that they wish to make to the Commission\" â€” this is after receiving the decision of the commission, but before the commission is deemed to have been \"Fully Constituted\".\nSuch \"Interim Application\" would lead to an \"Interim Commission\" comprising one of the 3-person panel hearing.\n\"The Interim Commission shall decide all procedural and evidential matters and shall give directions within two clear days of their appointment with a view to ensuring the resolution of the Interim Application within 14 clear days of it being made, save in exceptional circumstances.\"\nIn other wordsâ€¦ it ain't over till it's over!\n279 Posted 28/10/2023 at 11:31:02\nThe problem with having no detail of the charge is that any of the elements mentioned could be the cause of breaching the 3-year limit.\n280 Posted 28/10/2023 at 11:32:27\nThere's a third possibility, which is that these bastard journo hacks just made the whole thing up for the sake of a brilliant headline: \"12-point deduction\" — shock horror!!!\nSadly there is really absolutely no redress that can be obtained for such dastardly cunning. Something about Freedom of the Press (Levinson Enquiry notwithstanding).\n281 Posted 28/10/2023 at 11:39:20\nThanks for your sensible and knowledgeable additions to this discussion.\nOn the 3-year thing, what do you make of the Covid provision and how it expanded things to 4 years with two of them averaged because of Covid?\nDo you think this is part of the P&S equation or not?\n282 Posted 28/10/2023 at 11:39:48\n283 Posted 28/10/2023 at 11:51:34\n284 Posted 28/10/2023 at 11:56:58\nEssentially, the rule is simple. Don't breach £105m loss over 3 year period (as you say the covid years include 2 years averaged).\nOff the top of my head, our top line losses for the 3 years is around £300m so we have to then deduct what we can to get to £105m and the covid losses are a big (and contentious) part of that.\nOne of my worries is that, even if there was something like a tax accounting mistake that caused us to go beyond the figure, the charge is so wide that it allows the commission to open up all of the elements for scrutiny.\nPaul the Esk got our overspend for the period (after deductions) down to about £60m some time ago and that's why he finds it hard to believe this is EFC tripping over a small procedural thing. We just don't know till the judgement!\n285 Posted 28/10/2023 at 13:30:37\nIf I read it correctly, it seems that if one or other of the parties (Everton or the Premier League) may feel that some measure, order or relief could or should be considered, probably in respect of the punishment ordered.\nI see it as an added opportunity for Everton to claim relief from the penalty if they can argue it is unreasonable, disproportionate or unprecedented. For example, in the extreme: \"What you have ordered will result in putting the club into administration and possible termination.\" I don't believe they have the opportunity to make such a point as part of their case because it depends on the commission's findings.\n286 Posted 28/10/2023 at 14:49:16\nI think a more conventional use for interim measures is to allow something to continue or, sometimes, to stop something from continuing pending the outcome of a hearing. So in the interim period between complaint and judgement the interim order would uphold a position that ultimately might be ruled against once the commission's decision is made.\nLike so much of this case, we'll only see in the coming days/weeks. Christ I hope it's not longer than that, I'll have a breakdown!\n287 Posted 28/10/2023 at 18:52:59\nI actually don't mind picky and of course the losses in the previous 2 years are relevant as they contribute to the overall 3-year calculation.\nThe point I was trying to dismiss is the suggestion that the charge relates in some way to the huge amount we claimed in Covid exemptions 2 or 3 years back.\nWe were given a clean bill of health back then but, despite this, people still seem to feel this to be the reason we were charged with breaching P&S guidelines.\nI'm simply saying it's not relevant.\n288 Posted 28/10/2023 at 19:47:16\nMy own perfect outcome would be for Taylor Swift to buy the club. First, there would be the opportunity for an annual series of concerts at the new ground â€“ preferably with eye-watering ticket prices. That would be nice.\nBut best of all, imagine what would happen within the families of the twats currently plotting our downfall. There would be 14-year-old girls (and Justin Trudeau) besieging their parents, uncles, grandfathers or whoever else was involved day and night, on social media, the threats would be endless and the protagonists absolutely unassuageable. And not just in this country, the sleazy creeps of UEFA, FIFA and in the government would be under incessant and extreme pressure.\nFinally, the RS would become the hate figures of the most demented demographic on the planet, teenage girls, and would probably fold ignominiously into a pathetic heap within a few months.\nSadly, this would probably have been a call Bill Kenwright actually could have made.\n289 Posted 28/10/2023 at 21:20:23\nNo idea how he knows but, in this case, I really hope they're right.\n290 Posted 28/10/2023 at 22:19:43\n291 Posted 29/10/2023 at 07:22:19\nThe owner and the board he appointed are the people to blame and the Premier League approved him as a fit and proper person, not us.\nI followed the case against Derby County when they went into liquidation. Their supporters suffered two points deductions. When their supporters learned that the St John's Ambulance had lost money as a result of the liquidation, they clubbed together so that the charity were paid. These supporters are wonderful people not deserving to be picked on by the EFL.\nEventually only foreign-owned huge corporations will be able to comply with the cash-mad Premier League. 25 years from now, the top Premier League game will be Google Athletic v Apple United. The two mega companies will own all the networks by then anyway. And the Premier Leaguewill approve it all on the nod. They are not fit for purpose.\n292 Posted 29/10/2023 at 07:33:56\n293 Posted 29/10/2023 at 07:57:57\nI'm reading that 777 Partners are trying to find half a billion pounds in loans to purchase Everton, and although they are not trying to put the loan onto the club, will this really make things better for Everton?\n294 Posted 29/10/2023 at 08:21:42\nWe are potentially being made an example of as an easy target on one charge.\nCity with their 115 charges. In theory, they could face a Glasgow Rangers type scenario.\nChelsea?\nAston Villa?\nEven Nottingham Forest living about their means.\nIf they open this can of worms, then if they demonstrate consistency it won't just be Everton.\n295 Posted 29/10/2023 at 08:35:23\n296 Posted 29/10/2023 at 00:20:54\nIt was decided that no points deduction should be applied, as it was unfair on the supporters and the club.\nHowever clubs have faced similar situations, where a club has gone into administration, because of the owner, not the fault of the fans or the players, however the following were not so lucky, even though it was not the fans fault.\nWrexham -10 points\nCambridge utd -10 points\nRotherham Utd -10 points\nCrawley Town -6 points\nBoston Utd -10 points\nLeeds Utd -10 points Leeds Utd again -15 points\nLuton Town -10 points\nLuton again -20 points\nBournemouth-10 points\nBournemouth again - 17 points\nChester City - 26 points\nStockport -10 points\nSouthampton -10 points\nCrystal Palace -10 points\nPortsmouth - 9 points premier league\nBolton Wanderers -12 points\nWigan -12 points\nThere are many more but every team above were docked points, through the owners fault, and not the fans.\nThe only teams to escape a points deduction, through the fault of the owners were the big six breakaway teams.\nStinks to high heavens.\n297 Posted 31/10/2023 at 08:28:09\nThe likes of Man City and Chelsea appear to have been breaching rules for years, with seemingly very little being done about it, other than some paltry fines, which mean very little to them, yet we are being hung out to dry for one potential breachâ€¦â€¦â€¦..\nChelsea: Samuel Eto'o and Willian transfers under Premier League investigation\n298 Posted 31/10/2023 at 09:47:18\nJordan said that he thought in the 1st week of the commission the Premier League's case seemed very weak, but was much stronger in the 2nd week.\nAlso, the Premier league it seemed leaked to all and sundry that, if guilty, they want the commission to impose a 12-point penalty.\nDespite being told months ago that we would find out our fate on the 25 October, we are now being told it will be weeks before the commission releases their decision.\nI am presuming that the KC that Everton hired, if not given the decision, will have some idea of what he thinks will be the outcome, and presumably has informed our owner of his thoughts.\nNow I know Moshiri probably felt compelled to attend the West Ham game following Bill Kenwright's death, but I wonder whether the owners of 777 Partners being there had any added significance to Moshiri being there?\nCould he have been told the commission's findings and was there to inform 777 and discuss the final figure if any points deductions are likely?\n299 Posted 31/10/2023 at 10:43:55\n\"Big Six\" got away with a slap on the wrist for plotting to ruin domestic football. Why are the Premier League trying to crush Everton? Well worth a read.\nOne conclusion is that they are trying to use us as an example to the politicians that they can regulate football. As if!\n300 Posted 31/10/2023 at 11:47:28\nMight go towards why our losses were so much greater.\n301 Posted 31/10/2023 at 12:01:43\nI would scrutinise the interests of anyone involved with signing off a decision that penalises the club and fans.\nI'm not sure that â€˜independent' really works where football is concerned, if you are detached then the likelihood is you don't understand the impact.\nAnyway let's see, maybe a â€˜no score draw' with a suspended sentence so the Super Six can plough on under the radar.\n302 Posted 31/10/2023 at 12:07:42\nChelski got fined for financial deception for many years under the Russian Abramovich and no points deduction and that fine was just a drop in the ocean for Chelski.\n303 Posted 31/10/2023 at 12:20:24\nIf it's in our favour, you might well find the opposite is true, and the Premier League appeal the decision and press for us to be sanctioned.\nEither way, my suspicion is that nothing will be resolved this season, and even if it is, any points deduction would only apply from next season anyway - surely they can't apply a points deduction mid-season?\nIt has to be as even a playing field as possible, and as such any deduction would be for the following season.\n304 Posted 02/11/2023 at 11:37:55\nDear sirs\nI am a lifelong Everton supporter so by definition pay particular attention to news pertaining to \"my\" club.\nI have read in The Daily Telegraph that they claim exclusive information regarding recommendations by the PL to the independent commission about potential penalties to the club if they are found (among other clubs) to have breached the league's P&S rules.\nCan the league confirm if this is fact and indeed if it is official information which may be available in the public domain? Or is it simply unfounded and ill disposed rumour mongering by the journalists reporting the recommendation for whatever reason?\nIf it is the former, I am surprised not to see similar articles in other media, and the DT would not then be claiming, tabloid fashion, an \"exclusive\". If it is the latter I would suggest a friendly word in the ear of someone at the DT might be in order.\nHowever if it is possibly a third scenario - that the PL will indeed be recommending as the DT claim but it is not supposed to be official public knowledge, then the PL look closer to home and find out who might be stirring up this gossip.\nThank you in anticipation. I look forward (somewhat optimistically) to receiving your reply and perhaps an explanation, and remain in the meantime\nYours faithfully\nKim V Vivian,\nKent based expat Evertonian\n------------------------------------\nGeneral Info\n10:46 (45 minutes ago)\nto me\nDear Kim\nThank you for your email.\nPlease visit the link below for our most recent update:\nhttps://www.premierleague.com/news/3120469\nAs the statement confirms, the matter is currently being investigated by an independent Commission.

Either way there should have been a punishment for the guilty party/ies.\n309 Posted 02/11/2023 at 13:52:39\nWe need a blue with contacts in the media to highlight these responses and challenge the Premier League. Any chance you know someone, Lyndon?\nMeanwhile disappointing that Paul the Esk has suggested that 777 Partners and Moshiri attending games together is arrogantly suggesting that they are suggesting approval is a formality and this should be frowned upon by the authorities making the decision.\n310 Posted 02/11/2023 at 14:00:23\nI wonder if Lyndon can put a petition up for us all to lodge with one of the media to question this absurdity.\nMeanwhile Paul the Esk is doing the takeover no favours by suggesting 777 and Moshiri attending the games together should be looked upon unfavourably by the people deciding whether they are fit and proper persons.\nGive it a rest, Paul, please. Not many are overenamoured with the prospect of 777 Partners as new owners but at least they will provide hands-on business management â€“ something Dumb and Dumber have neglected for years.\n311 Posted 02/11/2023 at 14:07:42\nAndy Hunter at The Guardian is a Blue, perhaps worth contacting him?\n312 Posted 02/11/2023 at 14:23:18\nDidn't expect much else really.\nOnward Evertonians.\n313 Posted 02/11/2023 at 14:23:20\nI then replied to @Hisham:\nBloody fob off.\n314 Posted 02/11/2023 at 15:25:32\n“We are unable to comment further while this is ongoing.â€\nHowever, surely their leaking of the penalty they want if we're guilty is in fact a statement in itself?
