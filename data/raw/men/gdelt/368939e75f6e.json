  "body_text": "Celtic have stepped up their efforts to land Belgian winger Michel-Ange Balikwisha, with a delegation now in Belgium aiming to finalise a deal that’s been stalling over personal terms.\nAn agreement in principle has already been reached between Celtic and Royal Antwerp, with a £4.5 million fee reportedly agreed. But the move has yet to be completed, with personal terms proving to be the stumbling block in recent days.\nNow, Celtic officials have travelled to Belgium this weekend to meet directly with Balikwisha’s representatives in a bid to get the deal over the line. The 24-year-old has already featured four times for Antwerp this season, scoring once, but has been the subject of transfer speculation throughout the summer. Antwerp have even begun identifying replacements, suggesting they’re preparing for his departure.\n🚨EXCLUSIVE: Celtic FC come in Belgium to convince Michel-Ange Balikwisha!\n🔴⚪️ Although the agreement reached with Royal Antwerp FC, the deal is on hold & Celtic will meet with the player’s entourage this weekend.\n☘️The goal: A personal terms agreement. #mercato #JPL #RAFC pic.twitter.com/Ie9A7ftYlt\n— Sacha Tavolieri (@sachatavolieri) August 22, 2025\nThe Hoops are in urgent need of reinforcements out wide, with just three senior wingers available to Brendan Rodgers. The manager has made no secret of his desire for more quality in the final third and Balikwisha is viewed to fit the mould.\nWhether Celtic can strike an agreement with the player’s camp remains to be seen, but this latest move signals serious intent. With the clock ticking on the transfer window, Celtic know this weekend’s talks could be decisive.",
