I’m enjoying the moment,” Guiu said after his debut goal. “I’ve been working my whole life for this opportunity and it turned out perfect.”\nHe added: “I saw that Joao Felix controlled it alone, and there was a lot of space behind the centre-backs. He gave it to me with the quality he has, and facing Unai Simon it became a reality. It was a very quick move, I hardly thought about it, it was all intuition.”\n-“I don’t really think that it’s changed that much in my life,” he said when reflecting on his rise into the Barcelona first team. “I’m still living a normal life and I think that I’m making a decent job of it.\n“I’m still adapting to my environment, which is a good thing, so that’s basically how it is.”\n– “I’m just a player like the rest of them, I work as hard as the others and I’m really no different,” he said during the Under-17 World Cup. “I try to bring a happy vibe and be a good team-mate.”\nMarc Guiu scored 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔 for Barça B.\n🤯📐\n(via @FCBarcelona_cat)pic.twitter.com/tHyAs20knz\n— B/R Football (@brfootball) February 19, 2024\nWhat they’ve said about him\n– “Marc, a kid from La Masia, makes the difference for us,” Xavi said after Guiu’s debut. “I’m happy for him and for the three points, which are very important.\n“I’ve thought about him because he’s got a goal, a spark, and I like him personally. I have no problem looking to the academy, quite the opposite actually. I give the confidence that I was given by Barcelona when I was 17-18 years old.”\nHe continued: “Guiu’s face on the bench didn’t look scared. He was looking at me with the ‘coach, put me on!’ face. I saw that he was ready and I subbed him in. You can tell that he can score goals, and everything went well. I’m so happy.”\n– “I was very happy for Marc, he deserves it because he is a ten as a person,” former Barcelona coach Ivan Carrasco said. “He’s a sensational boy, a hard worker, an example as a team-mate for his effort and dedication.\n“He is a pure centre forward, a classic ‘9’, a specialist in the area who lives from his physical power. His best virtue is his aerial play. Marc is also very quick and powerful, he is unstoppable with space.\n“He is not a striker who can drop to the flanks or stands out for his combination play but he is aware of his strengths and limitations and knows how to focus on his strengths and hide his flaws.\n“Another of his virtues is his great ability to fight for every ball and press like an animal, defenders are not comfortable with such a hard-working striker profile.”\n– “He’s still the same kid he’s always been – everything that’s happened has had no effect on him whatsoever,” Spain Under-17 coach Jose Lana said.\n“He’s still very polite, a hard worker, very respectful both of the coaching staff and his team-mates. He’s great to work with. He can create chances and score goals out of nowhere, and that’s such an important part of football.”\n– “He is not a player with unbelievable dribbling skills but he is a finisher who can run from deep,” former La Masia coach Albert Capellas said.\n“He is fast, powerful, very good at heading, very competitive. He is exceptional in his position and has the right mentality, a fantastic boy.”\n– [He] is known as a striker who is more efficient in the box,” Spanish football expert Guillem Balague said. “He doesn’t link up greatly but he has something; he finishes very well.”\nREAD MORE: Nine Chelsea transfer targets at Euro 2024 as Enzo Maresca evolution unfolds",
