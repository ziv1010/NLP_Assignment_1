We should be proud of the way we represented our country tonight.\"\nModric is playing in his fifth Euros and has also appeared at four World Cups.\nBut he said he would not be retiring from football yet, as he continues to perform at the highest level after also winning his sixth Champions League title with Real Madrid earlier this month.\n\"I'd like to keep playing forever but there will probably be a time I'll have to hang up my boots,\" Modric said.\n\"I'll keep playing on, I don't know for how much longer.\"\nHis first European Championship ended with an agonising quarter-final exit at the hands of Turkey in 2008, when Croatia took the lead in the 119th minute in extra time, before conceding an equaliser and then losing on penalties.\nModric admitted Monday's heartbreak ranked alongside that loss 16 years ago.\n\"It's hard to actually outdo the Turkey game from 2008 but this game probably runs it pretty close. It's certainly a sad day for us and the Croatian national team.\"\nModric was substituted in the 80th minute, left to watch from the sidelines as Zaccagni likely sent his team crashing out in agonising fashion.\n\"I didn't want to waste him for more minutes, we needed to freshen up and get some guys on the pitch who could help,\" said coach Zlatko Dalic.\n\"I wanted in the last 10-15 minutes to bring on someone who was a bit fresher because Luka had given everything.\"\n© 2024 AFP",
