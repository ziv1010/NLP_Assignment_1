  "body_text": "FOOTBALL – TOTTENHAM Hotspur have sacked manager Ange Postecoglou, the club said yesterday, little more than two weeks after the Australian guided the London club to a first major trophy in 17 years with victory in the Europa League final.\nWhile Postecoglou’s fate has split opinion amongst the fans, the 59-year-old ultimately paid the price for an horrendous Premier League season which saw Tottenham finish 17th.\n“The Board has unanimously concluded that it is in the best interests of the Club for a change to take place,” Tottenham said in a statement.\n“Following a positive start in the 2023/24 Premier League (PL) season, we recorded 78 points from the last 66 PL games. This culminated in our worst-ever PL finish last season.”\nPostecoglou leaves two years to the day after his appointment and 16 days after his side beat Manchester United 1-0 in Bilbao for the club’s first silverware since 2008, a win that also put them in next season’s Champions League.\nThe former Celtic manager has had to face questions over his future for several months, yet delivered on his claim early last season that he always wins a trophy in his second season in a job.\nHe also took Tottenham to the League Cup semi-final but their league campaign was their worst since 1976-77, the last time the club suffered relegation from the top flight.\nSeveral managers have been linked to the Tottenham job, including Brentford’s Thomas Frank and Crystal Palace’s Oliver Glasner.",
