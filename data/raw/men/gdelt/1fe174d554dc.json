This deadline cannot be extended.'\nIt means Chelsea must decide which three of their eight January signing to add to their squad before Thursday night.\nChelsea face an awkward situation as UEFA rules allow only three new players to be registered for the knockout rounds - their January signings include Mykhailo Mudryk (left) and Joao Felix\nBenoit Badiashile, signed from Monaco, cost £35m - but will he play in the Champions League?\nThere is some wriggle room because Chelsea only named 24 players of a permitted 25 on their List A for the group stage, leaving open an extra space.\nIt means Chelsea can only add one of Fernandez, Felix, Mudryk and Badiashile initially before they have to remove existing senior players from the list.\nHowever, because of the 'three new players' rule, one of that quartet is going to be left off anyway.\nArticle 46.03 of the rules says: 'If the registration of such new players causes the number of players on List A to exceed 25, the club must remove the necessary number of currently registered players to reduce the squad to 25 players again.'\nIt would also appear other January arrivals such as Noni Madueke, Andrey Santos and David Datro Fofana will miss out on Champions League football this season. Malo Gusto has rejoined Lyon on loan until the end of the season.\nAnother complication is that Chelsea must have eight 'locally trained players' in the 25.\nUEFA divide this into 'club-trained players' - those who between the age of 15 and 21 were registered with Chelsea for a period, not necessarily continuous, of three seasons or of 36 months.\nWithin the eight, they can have a maximum of four 'association-trained players' who between that age range were registered for three seasons or 36 months with another English club.\nPotter could omit senior players currently injured to make way for some of the new boys, such as Wesley Fofana or Christian Pulisic. Loanee Denis Zakaria could also be chopped.\nChelsea owner Todd Boehly has spent heavily on new signings during the January window\nBut they cannot remove the injured Armando Broja because he was on List B, for under-21 players who have been at the club for a certain amount of time.\nChelsea won't face similar problems registering the players for the Premier League, whose rules are less rigid than UEFA's.\nThe Blues took their signing of Fernandez from Benfica right up to the wire on Tuesday night, breaking the British transfer record to seal a £107m deal.\nThe Argentina World Cup winner has signed an eight-and-a-half year contract until June 2031.\nMost watched Sport videos\n- Disgusting drink act caught on camera at ICC T20 World Cup\n- Tiffany Salmond dazzles in red bikini at Bondi Icebergs\n- Team GB Winter Olympics hero: Matt Weston wins skeleton gold\n- IOC President in tears after Ukrainian athlete is kicked out\n- NBA player makes long-awaited debut after battle with cancer\n- Team USA skier Breezy Johnson gets engaged after crash\n- Aussie snowboarder Scotty James shows off his dance moves\n- Has VAR broken football?
