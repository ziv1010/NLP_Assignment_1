  "body_text": "Italian football expert Nicky Bandini looks at four key people at Internazionale Milano who stand between Manchester City and their dreams of an historic Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League treble.\nThe manager: Simone Inzaghi\nBrother to the former AC Milan striker, Pippo, Simone was often overshadowed by his older sibling during their playing days despite winning a league title of his own, and several cups, at Lazio.\nInzaghi has been the more successful manager, steering his former club Lazio to a Coppa Italia win, two Supercoppa Italiana triumphs, and a first UEFA Champions League qualification in more than a decade before moving to Inter in 2021.\nHe arrived at a time of budget cuts, with Romelu Lukaku and Achraf Hakimi sold that first summer, yet has won every edition of both domestic cups since he arrived.\nAndre Onana (GKP)\nFive clean sheets in six knockout matches could not have happened without some crucial interventions from the man between the posts.\nSigned on a free transfer after his contract expired at Ajax, Onana began this season as the back-up to Samir Handanovic, but won the starting role by mid-October and has not looked back since.\nHe made a brilliant double-save during the first leg of their last-16 tie with Porto and followed that up with a point-blank stop to preserve their lead in stoppage time of the second leg.\nSee: How losing to Liverpool helped Inter's progression\nNicolo Barella (MID)\nIt was Barella who set Inter on track for their UEFA Champions League quarter-final win over Benfica, scoring the first goal in both legs, although he is as adept at creating opportunities as finishing them.\nHis 12 assists last season were the joint-most of any midfielder in Europe’s top five leagues, and although that number dropped to a more modest six in this campaign, it is his versatility that marks him apart.\nAs often found winning possession on the edge of his own box as he is driving into the opposition’s, Barella's energy and hunger provide an example that team-mates tend to follow.\nLautaro Martinez (FWD)\nA 2022 FIFA World Cup winner with Argentina in December, Martinez failed to score at the tournament and was criticised for his performances, but subsequently revealed he had been playing through “unbearable” ankle pain.\nHe has endured dry spells in Serie A, too, and the occasional loss of confidence might be his greatest weakness.\nWhen he backs himself, Martinez often looks unplayable. An agile, explosive presence with deceptive power and aerial ability, he has become more involved in Inter’s build-up play this season and ends it in prolific form, with 11 goals and four assists in his last 13 appearances.\nNicky Bandini (@nickybandini) is a sports writer and broadcaster who specialises in European football.\nAlso in this series\nPart 1: Guardiola: History won't define this year's final\nPart 2: Why Guardiola must keep it simple against Inter\nPart 3: How losing to Liverpool helped Inter's progression\nPart 5: Premier League clubs in Champions League finals",
