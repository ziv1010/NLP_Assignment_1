They were superb in the 1-0 win over Man City two weeks ago and were unfortunate not to be ahead at Anfield before an error from Emiliano Martinez.\nIt was an uncharacteristic mistake from the Argentine who will be desperate to make amends this week. The Villa defenders will also want to deliver a more assured display after consistently giving the ball away against Liverpool as they attempted to play from the back.\nEmery will also be hoping for an improved display from striker Ollie Watkins who has just one goal in 10 league games this season and is in his worst run of form since the Spaniard took over at Villa Park three years ago.\nWhile Bournemouth did come away from the Etihad empty-handed, it has been another remarkable season thus far for the south coast club. The Cherries sold a host of their top performers in the summer but have lost just twice in the league.\nForward Antoine Semenyo has been sensational, while they appear to have unearthed another talent in frontman Eli Junior Kroupi. The 19-year-old scored in three consecutive Premier League games before the defeat to City and will provide stern competition to Evanilson.\nWith a togetherness in the team and no shortage of talent, Iraola will be confident his side can bounce back at Villa Park and get back to winning ways.\nSee also ► These are the cheapest ways to watch the Premier League this season\nAston Villa vs Bournemouth: Expected line-ups\nFourFourTwo's prediction\nAston Villa 1-1 Bournemouth\nFourFourTwo is predicting that this will be an even and entertaining contest that will end with the points being shared.\nWe test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses.
