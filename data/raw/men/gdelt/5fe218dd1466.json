  "body_text": "Joe Cole makes bizarre Aston Villa v Newcastle United prediction\nJoe Cole has been talking about Newcastle United ahead of the start to the season.\nThe former Aston Villa and England winger discussing Saturday’s match at Villa Park.\nJoe Cole of course was the person who picked Newcastle United out of the hat (see above) in August 2023 in the Champions League group of death, meaning Eddie Howe’s side had to face PSG, Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan in that group stage.\nOnly 13 days now until the 2025 Champions League draw, which will take place on Thursday 28 August 2025.\nAhead of that though, Joe Cole concentrating now on Aston Villa v Newcastle in the Premier League, speaking to Paddy Power:\n“I’m covering this game on the TV and I’m really looking forward to it. I love going to Villa Park and watching football, there’s always a great atmosphere.\n“These are two teams who have the shackles on in the transfer market because of financial fair play so we’ll have to wait and see if they can go for it before the window closes.\n“The Alexander Isak situation at Newcastle is something that will affect them because he’s such a big player for them. Eddie Howe’s handled it really well. I like it when a manager draws a line in the sand.\n“He needs to show authority and he has done that. I can only see Isak joining Liverpool in the end, but Howe’s handled it really well because he’s got to get his team ready to go to Villa Park and get a result.\n“I feel it’s going to be hard for either of these teams to his the heights of last season given their restraints in the market. But, this game, this is a stalemate for me. It will be a good game though and I fancy 2-2.\n“It might be worth looking at Emi Martinez to make 3 or more saves in that Villa goal. He’s the kind of guy who likes to get involved and put on a show for the cameras, especially with this being the first game of the season.\n“With Isak AWOL, Anthony Elanga is the man who carries the biggest goal threat for Newcastle, I think he’s a great signing. I fancy him to score but for Martinez to be busy as the goals fly in at both ends.”\nSome interesting predictions there from the former England player, predicting a draw and Anthony Elanga to score.\nHowever, Joe Cole with one very bizarre prediction.\nHe fancies Emi Martinez to be kept busy and make at least three saves, well, I would have a million to one on the Argentine keeper making a single save.\nHe is suspended for this match after his daft red card at Old Trafford on the final day of last season, a sending off that helped ease Newcastle United into the Champions League at the expense of Aston Villa.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
