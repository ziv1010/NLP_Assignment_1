  "body_text": "Liverpool 2 - 0 Everton\nBeyond all the pre-match blather, blustering and bravado that began before the weekend and has carried through at a relentless pace, we will soon get to know the truth of the matter as the 242nd derby match is finally set to kick off at Anfield.\nSean Dyche starts only his second match in charge of the Blues and has made a big call in handing Ellis Simms only his second Premier League start in place of the injured Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\nLooks like Everton won the toss and chose to switch ends, Liverpool kicking off and hoofing it upfield. Onana was caught by Fabinho to give Everton a free-kick that Coady played long and Tarkowski headed behind. Simms headed on the first long punt from Pickford.\nEverton looked to retain their shape and press when the opportunity came, with Liverpool going long to evade the midfield block. Simms got a half-chance off Matip but waited too long for the ball to bounce and his shot was blocked.\nSalah looked to get free but was immediately surrounded in the Everton area. Simms again got to the clearance but Mykolenko couldn't do much with the lay-off. Simmms again laid off a clearance, this time to Iwobi.\nTarkowski had to slide across Nunez and give away a very dangerous free-kick on the edge of the penalty area but Salah hit his own player in the dummy wall.\nIt was all a bit too crowded in midfield, Everton giving up possession too easily and allowing Liverpool time to build more attacks. But Doucoure won a good tussle with Robertson near the corner flag. Henderson bounced off Onana off the ball and played dead. Tarkowski strong-armed Salah beautifully off the ball.\nEverton were not playing enough forward ball, however, and Nunez produced a half-chance from a quick throw-in that was headed wide. Simms was doing well repeatedly getting to Pickford's clearances but the second ball was going Liverpool's way and coming straight back to Pickford.\nIn a rare decent forward move, Onana allowed Henderson to sneak the ball off him and he tried to chase it, sliding into Alisson. Liverpool then piled on the pressure and all Everton could do was defend in numbers; when they did clear it, Simms could not use it.\nLiverpool's press was getting more and more effective, driving again and again into the Everton area, while the Blues could hardly get over the half-way line. If anything, the Blues were a little too naive trying and failing to play through midfield.\nIwobi gave away a foul wide right but Tarkowski headed the cross away. Yet it kept coming right back. Alexander-Arnold smacked Onana in the face and the free-kick at least saw the Blues advance and somehow win a corner. But Iwobi's delivery was easily defended and Gueye did his usual wild attempt when the ball fell for him.\nA cross in from McNeil after some good work from throw-ins was too close to Alisson. But McNeil did well to win another corner delivered high by Iwobi which Tarkowski headed onto the post. Simms picked up the rebound and played in McNeil but his shot was blocked and Liverpool advanced at tremendous pace on the breakaway, four on two, and Salah beat Pickford easily as the Everton man picked the wrong player to shoot Liverpool ahead.\nDoucoure tried to advance but too slow and Simms was easily blocked off the ball. There was little to no response from Everton who needed to lock down the defence under more Liverpool pressure after they were so massively exposed on the counter.\nTarkowski caught Henderson a bit late but escaped a yellow card. Gatkpo sold the ref on a foul by running across Iwobi. Everton were being suckered all over the pitch and had failed to come to terms with the intensity or energy of this match in the first half.\nLiverpool were given another free-kick in added time, and claimed a penalty off it that was not given. A poor half for Everton overall.\nNo changes after the break, and a massive mountain to climb as Liverpool have all the momentum and impetus. Let's see just what Sean Dyche can do here…\nEverton tried to play football down the wing, only to let it out of play. Doucoure was fouled by Matip, McNeil's free-kick sailing wastefully over everyone. Iwobi tried to beat four men and failed, Liverpool scampered forward again, Gakpo scored easily at the far post on Salah's deflected cross.\nMcNeil did well to win a corner but it was too close to Alisson, as was Tarkowski, committing the foul. Tarkowski then gifted a pass to a red shirt and Henderson fired close but over.\nMykolenko played in Iwobi but he shot too early, straight at Alisson. Liverpool broke at speed again, Nunez firing twice at Pickford from a narrow angle. Gray replaced Simms. Liverpool surged forward again, Nunezcurling his shot wide.\nAnother abysmal giveaway by Tarkowski, almost let Liverpool in again, Everton showing no sign of turning the game, and having to go more for damage limitation, but dangerously reduced to playing poorly out from the back without a target man.\nEverton tried to play up with some intricate passing until Iwobi lost it. Iwobi did well to get a ball wide to McNeil but Alexander-Arnold easily stole the ball off him. More errors from Tarkowski, who was having a 'mare.\nMaupay and Davies came on for the last 10 minutes. Iwobi put over a great cross, what a gift for Davies at the far post, but it was far too much to expect him to put his header on target. Instead, it was yet another gallop back to the Everton goal, Coady deflecting Salah's shot over for a Liverpool corner that caused chaos.\nA total lack of discipline by Doucoure saw him kick the ball away and get a stupid yellow card. Pickford got excited about Robertson playing through after the whistle and and it all kicked off, Onana getting involved very stupidly from the dugout.\nPickford had to produce a good save to stop Salah scoring a third, summing up the tone of a hugekly disappointing derby defeat.\nLiverpool: Alisson, Gomez, Fabinho, Salah (90' Elliott), Henderson (80' Milner), Gakpo (80' Firmino), Robertson [Y:86'], Nunez (70' Jota), Matip, Bajcetic (90' Keita), Alexander-Arnold.\nSubs not Used: Kelleher, van Dijk, Tsimikas, Phillips.\nEverton: Pickford [Y:88'], Mykolenko, Tarkowski, Coady [Y:67'], Coleman, McNeil (78' Maupay), Doucoure, Gana, Onana (78' Davies), Iwobi, Simms (61' Gray).\nSubs: Begovic, Holgate, Keane, Mina, Godfrey, Vinagre.\nReader Comments (301)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

COYB.\n2 Posted 13/02/2023 at 19:01:34\n3 Posted 13/02/2023 at 19:03:26\n4 Posted 13/02/2023 at 19:09:54\n5 Posted 13/02/2023 at 19:10:25\nI suspect that Dyche will want the same 13/14 players to start each game and play, pretty much, in the same way. Makes sense to me.\nWouldn't we all love it if Simms grabs a goal? Very anxious and the next few hours will be a tough watchâ€¦ but here goes.\n6 Posted 13/02/2023 at 19:19:00\n7 Posted 13/02/2023 at 19:19:33\n8 Posted 13/02/2023 at 19:20:50\nI think it's better to start him than expect the lad to change the game if we are chasing it. Maupay defo needs to play with someone as a pair or off a bigger man. Save Maupay's shithousery for when we are 1 or 2 up.\nLet's have it !!!!!\n9 Posted 13/02/2023 at 19:22:15\n10 Posted 13/02/2023 at 19:30:01\n11 Posted 13/02/2023 at 19:31:07\n12 Posted 13/02/2023 at 19:36:18\nWell we're 3 up on what I feared, so whatever happens tonight, I just want to see our lads stand up to these and fight for every ball, attack them whenever we can and have the same attitude as last week. Go At Them!\nI like the idea of Ellis, playing form the start, because last week we could have had at least four goals with CL narrowly missing a hat trick and DoucourÃ©...well missing a sitter! But the thing is we made them!\nPerhaps Ellis will get one or two chances like the ones last week. If so, let's see what he does with them. If McNeill plays as he did last week then that'll give them something to think about down the left, DoucourÃ© and Onana can go at them as well as create chances.\nNo doubt all the media will be whineing about the poor dear reds, but we just play our game. I'm sure Sean will hammering this into all day and every day. As we all would, I'd love to beat them, even with a last minute jammy penalty or manky home goal.\nIt's imprtant though, for me, that we are 3 points better off than I thought we'd be after two games\nCome on you Blues,give them a fight or even a fright!\n13 Posted 13/02/2023 at 19:44:15\nHaven't felt this optimistic playing there for a long while. Hopefully we'll get an early goal and get the players settled. COYB!!! Have it!\n14 Posted 13/02/2023 at 19:48:28\n15 Posted 13/02/2023 at 20:38:06\n16 Posted 13/02/2023 at 20:39:32\n17 Posted 13/02/2023 at 20:53:00\n18 Posted 13/02/2023 at 20:53:48\nWe have no calmness, touch or intent. Our midfield is dreadful.\nBring Gray on and play him up front. It's not done yet but it soon will be if we don't develop some courage. Utterly infuriating.\n19 Posted 13/02/2023 at 20:55:20\n20 Posted 13/02/2023 at 20:56:41\nNo great shock so far. Dyche will play percentages and that comes with pretty fine margins. Just got fine was shown in the 36th minute.\nEffort is there. Simms has done alright - at least he's playing the role we need. Hiding to nothing.\nNot sure how we get back in this. Will Dyche say more of the same, ie keep it tight and pinch one from a set piece?\n21 Posted 13/02/2023 at 20:57:18\n22 Posted 13/02/2023 at 20:58:32\n23 Posted 13/02/2023 at 20:58:39\n24 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:04:03\n25 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:04:53\nOk, need to change things around. Not Maupay, still need a target, midfield need to close it down, defend from the front, giving way too much space and time to allow them to just know 40 yards balls to the wings.\nIwobi and Coleman weak on that side. Don't leave the changes too long.\n26 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:06:15\nEverton midfield players all ball watching, rather than covering. Pickford with three players in shooting positions took a risk and guessed wrong.\n27 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:06:56\n28 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:13:36\n30 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:13:57\n31 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:14:30\n32 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:20:21\nOne good performance and we get our hopes up.\nBack to the old shite of can't find a team mate and no creativity.\nLose against Leeds and Forest and we are gone.\n33 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:22:15\n34 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:25:43\n35 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:30:19\n36 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:32:15\n37 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:35:51\nThe key remains Dominic Calvert-Lewin. If he's fit, we have a chance. If not, well there's nothing of any kind of substance in reserve.\nNot defending Lampard or criticising Dyche but signings in January were always the main order of business. We didn't do it and we'll be in a horrible scrap for the next few months.\n38 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:41:15\nI think this game is the lethal dose. It had to be them, of course.\n39 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:51:24\n40 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:51:34\n41 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:52:46\n42 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:53:45\nBeing in the States at least I won't have to watch this shite ever again.\n43 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:54:08\n44 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:54:36\nNo wonder Frank had a pop at that Doucoure by the way, as a quality midfielder back in his day he's probably dumbfounded at how on God's earth a Premier League footballer can't pass a ball.\nThat was absolutely dreadful that was tonight.\nCan we finally admit now that the problem is NOT the managers but the players???\n45 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:55:12\nI only enjoyed derbies with Big Dunc in his first spell.\nSo many problems it's futile listing them.\n46 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:55:41\nTo quote Khayyam;\n“The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,\nMoves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit\nShall lure it back to cancel half a Line,\nNor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.â€\n47 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:56:55\nWe beat Arsenal the league leaders at home and lost away to Liverpool. One win and three points more than anyone expected.\nThe home victory over Arsenal is important... if we can beat the league leaders at Goodison under Dyche then why not any team?\nBring it on!\n48 Posted 13/02/2023 at 21:59:09\nThe Arsenal game was the exception to the rule mate.\nTonight, that was ugly old Everton that I've seen most weekends for a year or more, spineless, clueless and shit houses.\nWhen did we last score a goal from open play?\nOur goal return is absolutely pathetic!!!\n49 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:00:26\nOverall got what we deserved but what happened to the passion and aggression we showed last week? On the plus side I would have bitten yer hand off for 3 points from the last 2 games. Also, at least Dyche knows now what he is up against.\nThe games at home to Leeds and Villa were always going to be the more important so trying to stay positive despite feeling like shite!\n50 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:01:30\nThere aren't 6 winnable games left, so if we're to stay up we need more results like the Arsenal one and not to put a foot wrong against Leeds, Villa and Bournemouth at Goodison. A big ask. In all likelihood, too big.\n51 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:02:32\nWithout a decent forward or a crap one getting bodies around him, then we are utterly doomed.\n52 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:02:38\nWe got beat, no surprise, no new injuries... roll on Saturday for the big game.\nI only thought Gana, Onana and Mykolenko showed up tonight.\nPickfords positioning for the first left me scratching my head as well as Coady letting the ball roll across the 6-yard box when he could have put it out for a corner. Real schoolboy stuff.\nThing is, unless Calvert-Lewin is fit, I think that's probably our strongest team.\nTom Davies with that header on the back stick just about summed the whole game up in one play.\n53 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:02:42\nThe negligence of duty is absolutely on an astronomical scale, failing to address the major issues on the pitch such as giving us some goal threats.\nAs I say, if we go down this season, we can have no complaints at all.\n54 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:03:01\n\"Exception to the rule\"?\nWe've had two games under Sean... there are no rules yet.\n55 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:03:18\nLook at the history since Shankly's arrival â€“ it is mind blowing in its dreadfullness.\n56 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:03:29\nWe knew in January we needed strikers and did nothing until the very last minute trying to get them in.\nWe had Moshiri saying he knows we need a striker.\nThat shower of shite of a board have stood back, tried to turn it back on the fans and will end up paying for not bringing a striker in.\nI've no doubts Calvert-Lewin was played while the transfer window was open to try and justify we have him and Simms.\nThe fans knew we would not get a full season out of him, so why is anyone suprised the shit we are in?\nThe fans will still be here, but that board are finished.\n57 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:04:31\nI hope now, supporters can see the utterly appalling results of changing managers 7 times, of not having a plan, or any strategy for playing football.\nTonight was for me such a low because all that was good last week was lost in a moment, we hit a post and lose a goal...\nnot only lost a goal, our midfield was 10 yards behind 3 RS forwards.\nDyche has his work cut out because quite simply we didn't chase, win, try... that was as bad as it gets.\n58 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:05:04\n59 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:06:38\nExactly how is this pile of lethargic shit going to stay in the Premier League? We should have kept Allardyce those years ago until the stadium move.\n60 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:06:59\nLiverpool, besides being a good footballing team, they are also good at chasing and scrapping for every loose ball; we don't.\nTrouble with us now is we have to beat all the good teams now, as we have lost to the so called weak teams who have added during the transfer window.\n61 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:07:04\n\"we've been relegated since January!\" I am glad you weren't the British Prime Minister during the blitz.\n62 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:07:13\nThree points from the last two games is a brilliant return, and the most important thing tonight was to get no injuries or red cards.\nDyche needs to lift the players this week, and we need to make Goodison a fucking bear pit on Saturday. Three points off Dirty Leeds and it's game on.\n63 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:07:30\nYou could see they RS were low on confidence at the start but we allowed them to grow into the game.\nThe amount of times our players had chances to put a tackle in and didn't was just shocking. We had chances to take a booking to stop both goals and didn't. The only bookings we got were for petulance and stupidity, not from getting stuck in.\nCoady should have put his foot to the ball for their second goal instead of taking the easy way out and leaving it go past him. Onana did absolutely nothing and deserved to be taken off.\nAgainst Arsenal, each time we had a cross, we got the ball in early, tonight it was back to slow play and no first-time balls.\nGray did offer something when he came on and has to start ahead of Iwobi next time out. Calvert-Lewin needs to be told he is starting the next game, the scan says he is okayâ€¦ get on with it.\nI can only hope Sean Dyche can give these overpaid cowards the roasting they deserve. I can take losing a game, but that performance tonight was just not good enough.\n64 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:07:36\nWhat the fuck!\nI would have taken 2 points from these last two fixtures, but its the performance tonight that is so concerning.\nLeeds is a must-win, folks, and they will be up for it.\n65 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:07:57\nIt's very hard to retain any optimism.\n66 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:08:18\n67 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:08:27\nYou don't have seven managers in 6 years, if you haven't got problems, but we have got to stick together now, hopefully get our centre-forward fit, and then try and get a little run of games together, whilst hopefully playing with a settled team.\nFootball is about many things. Heart and fight, commitment, quality and savvy, and then above all this comes ability, and yet nobody in our squad, consistently scores over a 6 out of 10, when it comes to any of the main ingredients required to be successful in the sport.\nI'm glad we have got Dyche rather than Lampard but, as far as the new manager bounce goes, then it's good footballers, that win you games, and we just haven't got nowhere near enough of these.\nThe players really need the fans now though, and the fans really need these players, to get us enough points to survive, so the only thing we can really do, is continue to try and fight through the pain, and stick together.\n68 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:08:41\n69 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:08:50\nIf he can't get a painkiller and get on with it, then we need to seriously start thinking he's Daniel Sturridge reincarnated.\nWe can't rely on a fella like this.\n70 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:10:24\nIf ever there was an opportunity to beat them, this was it. Almost as meek a performance as the now-infamous 3rd Round FA Cup tie just over 3 years ago.\nWhen was the last time we got hold of a game and dominated the opposition? Semi-final 1995? I swear it's that long ago.\n71 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:10:25\nThe positive is that we've got three more points than any of us would have realistically expected from the last two games.\nWe've even got a point more than two draws, which we'd all have bitten the hand off of whoever offered us them.\nStill gutted but we know how poor we are and we know our survival doesn't depend on results against the shite and the like.\n72 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:10:58\nObviously the players are crap. But, all you need is a handful of 1-0 wins albeit centre-backs heading in corners which very nearly happened tonight.\nThere are other crap teams in the division as well. The year Moyes made the top 4, we didn't have a scoring striker. Bent got just 6. Cahill got 11 but, as I say, that's when we finished 4th.\nOur aim this season is to finish 17th. Gray can score the odd worldy, Tarkowski, Coady, Mina even Keane can nab a few off corners. It can be done.\n73 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:11:31\n74 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:11:50\n75 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:11:59\nI thought we were gone last season... even posted shit to that effect on ToffeeWeb.\nI had absolutely no faith in Lampard last season but I firmly believe this season Sean will get us over the line.\nTo be fair, I'm pretty crap at this prediction stuff but hopefully not this season... ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘\n76 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:12:56\nRealistically, if you'd said we could walk away with 3 points from Arsenal and Liverpool, I think we all would have jumped at that... but it's not going to matter if we can't maintain a certain standard of play from week-to-week.\n77 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:13:16\nWell it's the only positive.\n78 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:14:28\nWe need 10 wins to stay up. We have four, and there are three winnable games left. The table makes it look like we're right in the fight to stay up, but it's all but over.\n79 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:15:55\n80 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:17:46\nLeeds a 6 pointer, need to play Holgate and Godfrey as fullbacks on Saturday. Coleman can't be expected to play two on the trot and Mykolenko was poor tonight.\nHope Garner is fit, Iwobi has to be dropped, and Calvert-Lewin hopefully back, if he was touch and go tonight. I'd play Mina instead of Coady as well.\n81 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:17:50\nWe were undoubtedly shit today but we'll beat Leeds and things will look better.\n82 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:21:14\nIt could have been a lot worse, a two-niller at Anfield when you are as bad as we've been this season is entirely respectable for a new manager.\nThe two shittest teams in the division have both lost 9 out the last 10 games. They both won a solitary one. Against us.\nBournemouth twatted us by seven goals over a 3-day period, the appalling Southampton blew us away at home. We ain't very good.\nSo going to the home of the team that's been in three of the last five Champions League finals was always going to be an uphill task, especially when they are our local rivals.\nOh, and we've got no striker.\nPerspective is needed.\n83 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:24:08\n15 seconds after we hit the post right in front of me they go and score.\nThey weren't that much better than us. Scrappy match. I'm gutted.\nI'm in the Arkles for my Grandad as always. Or the \"World Famous\" Arkles as it now calls itself and is labelled.\nCheeky bastards had a \"No away supporters\" sign up on the door with bouncers controlling it.\nWell I ignored that and I'm now surrounded by half of Ireland and London.\nReally sad to see the Police presence, both around Goodison where I went before, during the match and the riot vans queued up on Arkles Lane.\nI'll have to sleep on this one.\n84 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:25:29\nCoady at fault for second goal. Doucoure anonymous. Gueye his usual Sunday league self. Iwobi lost possession consistently.\nOnana schooled by Henderson. Simms isolated and when he got the ball, couldn't hold it up and bring anyone else in. Should have either been subbed at half-time or played in a two with Maupay.\nBottom 4 starting to get cut adrift and it will be really difficult if we don't beat Leeds.\n85 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:25:54\n86 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:26:18\nLose to Leeds and it's curtains.\nStrange the board show up at Anfield but won't come to Goodison. Sums the rancid, useless, dysfunctional, hopeless frauds up.\n87 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:26:30\nBut what did we expect? They had a choice of 5 strikers with a combined value of around 𧶲-300 million, and we had Simms, Gray, and Maupay.\nOur season will be defined by the next 3 games. This was a reality check, and the hope is Dyche learned about this set of players today.\nLeeds is a must win.\n88 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:30:47\nKeep it tight and nick one. Our defensive record isn't too bad. Our attacking record is the worst in the league. Those facts aren't about to change in my opinion. In fact, scratch the \"in my opinion bit\" it's practically an objective fact. It's not going to change.\nThe key was always improving the squad. We didn't. We made it worse.\nWe've gone from years of mismanaged decline to the Board waving the white flag and moving into a period of managed decline. The very fact Thelwell is still drawing a wage tells you that the transfer window wasn't for strengthening on the pitch â€“ it was for strengthening the finances.\nWe're in a period of \"do what you can with what you've got\". We even signed a manager known for doing exactly that who talked up the need to get more from the existing squad.\nThere's no-one in a leadership role at the club right now who isn't part of the problem. They're either setting this agenda, complicit in it, or at a minimum quietly compliant.\nWe probably need a bit better than one point a game from now on. Our survival chances depend on us either getting Calvert-Lewin fit, or winning 5 corners a game and scoring from 1. Oh, and our defence being close to the very best in the league.\nI never like losing to Liverpool. And maybe if Tarkowski's header is three inches to the right then Dyche looks like a genius in the short term. But the result of this game, for once, was only about the points. It doesn't tell us anything about the rest of the season that we didn't already know (What is left to learn? What can realistically change?).\nWe're not going down because we lost to Liverpool. We lost to Liverpool because we're a very poor side that doesn't have much hope of avoiding the drop.\n89 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:31:11\n90 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:33:21\nI'm clutching at straws but the header that Davies had should have made it 2-1, then bizarrely you never know. Yes, Liverpool have 5 strikers but Wolves put 3 past them.\nI do however feel that the Everton squad is by far the worst in the Premier League, and a few Championship clubs.\n91 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:34:14\nIt was embarrassing to see the ease with which they scored first. We just can't have six players in their box for set-pieces because of what repeatedly happens when we play high. We get caught out, and gift gold-plated chances to any team with just two-speed merchants in their midfield/attack. No other team in the division is as devoid of pace as we are in those areas â€“ and it's been like that for many years, not that the gruesome twosome seem to care.\nObviously limiting numbers in our set-piece adventures reduces the chance of us scoring but we most need to keep clean sheets for what's left of the latest calamitous season, and hope to nick one.\nAccording to Calvert-Lewin, our quickest players by far are Godfrey and Branthwaite. Is there a case for recalling / playing them both in such desperate times?\n92 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:34:20\nThat is exactly the ball that McNeill should have being looking to play to keep the pressure on.Blocking the defender from getting it and laying it off to Iowbi.But also the players covering for a counter attack where caught up in looking for a loose ball, like McNeill that was not the percentage ball to look for in such a situation.The second goal just showed how pace could wipe them out of the play.\nI am now thinking why I ever thought that Everton would turn up at this game, knowing they would be out of gas after their Arsenal exertions.\nDyche got a education tonight the players are just not fit, some will never move as they should. Most are just trying to move about, never mind think about what they are doing and being Professional about it.\nAt player who could have made a difference was either unsupported, isolated or snuffed out.\nMaybe Dyche has learned enough now to get Everton enough points and three other teams lose enough points.Dyche has to keep this lot playing to give us any chance.\nI know it is early yet as Brendan says and we would have taken three points from this last two games, but it against the lower level teams that the most telling points will count.Lets see how Dyche fares against them.\nThere was far too much spare in the front of the Everton defence.Tpp many wayward passrs coming out off defence..\n93 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:36:50\nNever seen such an OTT police presence as there was at Anfield tonight. Can't have been an officer anywhere else on Merseyside. There to protect us or our board?\n94 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:37:30\nEverton have scored ONE goal from open play since October 22.\nONE goal in open play in TEN matches.\n95 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:38:41\nI agree we've got to play Holgate and Godfrey at fullback, it's impossible for them to be worse than we saw tonight.\nLeeds and Villa are season-defining.\n96 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:40:09\nMina should play of he is fit. Mina in, Coady out. Coady shouts a lot, but defensively is poor. Holgate at right back until Patterson is fit. Coleman is too slow, he can offer something off the bench,.but his good performances are too fleeting.\nGarner hopefully can come in, for Gana who isn't up to standard, he's too slow, too weak. not half the player he used to be. He can be an option the bench when we are holding on to a victory.\nIwobi is not a winger, If we are playing wingers, he has to be left of the bench as an option to change set up if required. Play Grey off the right.\nUp front, I've no idea. Simms had a tough game, but was hardly an ideal game for a players first start. Would Maupay have been any better? We need DCL, obviously but other than that.\n97 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:40:40\nSomehow we survived against the Gunners as they have really quick players who pass very quickly but RS really only have Salah who most defenders can read now but of course Everton would have to be suckered in this game.\nThe result was a little predictable once DCL was a doubt.\nThe next game has to be a six pointer and Leeds who played really well against Manure will be no easy task but then no game will be easy from hereon in.\nWould like to see Dyche change the shape a little as we are still to easy to beat in midfield and inconsistent.\n98 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:43:29\n99 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:45:24\nEverton are too easy to dish out new contracts to players who have one good game and ten awful, it's been ongoing for years.\nIwobi doesn't need a contract extension, he's a part of our lack of goals in a key area.\nDavies doesn't need a new contract, let him go for nothing in June.\nDoucoure simply has to be removed, highest earner at the club, aged 30, offers nothing, Lampard quickly sussed him out for being a pussy.\nColeman needs to make Everton's mind up for them and retire this summer otherwise sentimental Bill will have another new deal on the table.\nCalvert-Lewin is NOT our main striker anymore, we need a REPLACEMENT not a backup for him, I said this in August last year.\nMykolenko is NOT a modern day fullback that can get forward, and is not good enough on the ball.\n100 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:45:26\n101 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:45:56\n102 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:48:58\n103 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:49:49\nThe reality of a bunch of mainly dysfunctional players in a club with invisible cowardly directors who cannot face their own fans.\nIts a nightmare and we need a miracle again to stay up against all the odds.\nWhatever happens we will see the last of them all in good time.\nIn the meantime, as Christine said earlier, we need a few of them to stand up and be counted.\nFortune favours the brave.\n104 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:53:57\nWe just haven't got the necessary quality up front, when Calvert-Lewin is out we are really limited and offer even less threat.\nLiverpool knew our defence is on the slow side and exploited it fully with their pace. They could have scored a couple more breaking away at speed.\nNo use letting this fester, 3/6 points from the RS and Arsenal most would have accepted as good. The upcoming games are crucial and winnable, we must focus on getting some serious points on the board, but we need DCL fit for the rest of the season to give us a fighting chance.\nFran , those changes changes defensively have to be taken into serious consideration . We cannot afford to get caught out like that again , just the pace of the counter attack made it very easy to score , other teams will be all over it having watched that tonight . It's food for thought for Sean Dyche.\n105 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:55:41\nDon't think so. I think Sean got it right against Arsenal but failed against the Redshite.\nHe'll be working on getting it right again!\n106 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:57:59\nWe will all be there with them.\nI will be.\n107 Posted 13/02/2023 at 22:59:59\nIf Saturday's game isn't high risk, then I'm not going. We need everyone pulling in the same direction, so we definitely don't need agent Kenwright, who seemed quite at home tonight.\nIf Kenwright attends, then this is only going to turn the crowd away from the most important matter of getting behind the team. STAY AWAY LIAR, LET THE EVERTONIANS GET ON WITH SUPPORTING THEIR TEAM\n108 Posted 13/02/2023 at 23:00:15\nI don't think Calvert Lewin would have made any difference.Probably glad he was not playing.Actually I thought Simms did lead the line well, but was isolated.Any lay off he made to a recieving Everton player who where mostly off the pace.At was attacking opportunities he had early chance which he fluffed.\n109 Posted 13/02/2023 at 23:02:58\nHistory doesn't count, in crisis.\nTonight Everton didn't turn up, barely turned up for about 5 / 95 minutes, which is very deeply concerning, in a Derby, and there was no leaders to work the head, the mind, make it tough, make the RS, think, break their stride.\nIt's not just Seamus, and Onana, who takes the ownership, every player should fight and play with pride for EFC, at every level, and the manager and coaching staff.\nSeriously some issues, in that no one took a chance, and took a shot, from outside the box. Why didn't McNeil, shoot first time, instead of taking his deadly touch... Harsh after last week, but tonight they played him into bad angles, for his left foot.\nSome humble attempts, in the second half, but the old failings came back to haunt Everton, getting mugged, on the counter attack.\nTom, had the best chance, to score, in real play, pass, move, and create, but I will not pass judgement or any sentence, as at least he was in the right position, but it raises further issues about Evertons coaching in ball skills, confidence, and football, techniques.\nThere's no excuse at this level of football, for not believing, when playing.\nLeeds and Villa, are massive, imho, must win, games, gutted to fade tonight.\nIronic, they got all the post Champions League positives, about Paris, today. But that's not an excuse. Fekkn, a minimum, every game, blood, sweat and tears.\nBut at the end of the day Everton players, and Management Team, must take ownership, and accountability.\nMassive month ahead, but Everton must believe, like never before.\nFor me, I'd start with Demari running the Leeds nags defence, all over the place, but then who will score the goals?\nWas Ellis, playing to a plan, tonight, but I felt for him, but also he seemed, well off touch in timing, scanning the pitch, and gambling for the ball or next move.\nI'd consider Vinagre, for Leeds, but perhaps his lack of game time will default him, but as I love the spirit of Miki, but he repeats the same cast iron passing, and position and marking, errors, every game for the time he's been, here bar a couple of games..\nThis is gonna be some second half of the season.\nUTFTs!\n110 Posted 13/02/2023 at 23:06:24\n111 Posted 13/02/2023 at 23:07:48\n112 Posted 13/02/2023 at 23:11:40\nBut they won't attend Goodison matches?\nShithouses.\nI'll be there next week, just as I was at Anfield today and stayed to the end and clap them off the pitch.\nIt might not mean a lot, but Mykolenko first over to the supporters again.\nThey don't deserve us. I won't get home until midday tomorrow, I'm surrounded by Kopites and I go again on Saturday.\nEverton\n113 Posted 13/02/2023 at 23:16:09\nOur season will not be defined by tonight\nOur season will be defined by the likes of Leeds and Villa\nIf we don't get 6 points from them we are down\n114 Posted 13/02/2023 at 23:17:32\nForget the board and get behind the players and the manager.\nNight all!\n115 Posted 13/02/2023 at 23:18:16\nI hope Dychey gets them up for the game against Leeds, they looked less than useless tonight especially after that unexpected performance versus Arsenal last time out.\n116 Posted 13/02/2023 at 23:18:40\nI thought Ellis Simms was woeful, he offered no attacking threat, didn't win any aerial battles and failed to close down any play from the back.\nThey looked dangerous every time they went down our left side, Mykolenko was over run and our Midfield went missing when we needed them.\nA very depressing performance. Why couldn't that header have gone in, it might have galvanised the team and burst their confidence.\n117 Posted 13/02/2023 at 23:20:02\nThere has to be an experienced striker somewhere in the world looking for a last big pay day before retirement. Find him, fast. Before it is too late.\nIt is unthinkable that we have only one (permanently injured) recognised goal scorer on our books. Without one, relegation seems inevitable.\nThis was a big setback tonight, we're agreed on that. The fight starts here. COYB.\n118 Posted 13/02/2023 at 23:28:34\nA breakaway goal after Tark hitting the post was brutal but two players missed their assignments. Then the goal that most thought was likely was still shocking.\nI think we will not go into shock but I really don't know how Dyche will do it. But I do think he will figure it out in time.\n119 Posted 13/02/2023 at 23:33:07\nBut to score goals from natural forward play, does look an issue, in terms of timing, belief and understanding. No one boosts a gut to follow, or finish a low cross, or take a pot shot...\nBut, as long as there's air, in my lungs, like never before, this is the year, for Evertonians, to stand up, fight and be counted.\nThe time is now.\nUTFTs!\n120 Posted 13/02/2023 at 23:35:46\n121 Posted 13/02/2023 at 23:41:17\n122 Posted 13/02/2023 at 23:45:04\nThe RS before tonight were the worst performing team in the Premier League since 1 January. Salah hadn't scored for ages and Gakpo hadn't scored at all!! Yet once again EFC come along, bearing gifts (maybe we need a couple of Greeks to play for us).\nWhen will this stop? Losses to Southampton, Wolves, Bournemouth and West Ham Utd â€“ all of whom were in a dreadful run of form. What is wrong with players who wear the blue of Everton ?\nTo make matters worse, our blue blooded Chairman turns up, no doubt telling everyone who would listen how awful the Everton fans are and how ungrateful too. (Please, Kenwright, stay away from Goodison. The Old Lady is sick of you.) No doubt you enjoyed listening to the RS taking the piss out of Everton. After all you've pissed all over our club and fans for many a decade.\n3 points are imperative against Leeds next weekend. Let's make sure we get them.\n123 Posted 13/02/2023 at 23:54:26\n124 Posted 14/02/2023 at 00:03:17\nWell said, lad, I'm fed up with all this woke shit, can't say this can't say that.\nCalvert-Lewin is a big girl's blouse, and he wears them, send him off to modeling school where he can't get hurt.\n125 Posted 14/02/2023 at 00:14:24\n126 Posted 14/02/2023 at 00:24:48\n127 Posted 14/02/2023 at 00:25:51\nDyche has to learn from this, more pace and mobility is needed through the core of our team. I am not going to defend Simms despite his tender years, I simply did not see the desire I would expect from a young lad, that performance was unacceptable.\nSimilarly, I cannot defend Conor Coady either, that second goal was an atrocity, heads must roll, Sean! Yerry has to play when fit.\nOn that performance, time has caught up with Seamus, painful to watch his role in that second goal, hate to call him out though as he has been terrific for us over the years.\nDespite his quality assist to Tom Davies, Iwobi is wasted out wide, we need his (relative) creativity and mobility down the middle of the park. We need Godfrey back in the side too.\nA sad, depressing night but the biggest battle awaits.\n128 Posted 14/02/2023 at 00:28:12\nUTFTs!\n129 Posted 14/02/2023 at 00:28:55\n130 Posted 14/02/2023 at 00:39:55\nWhy is it always the case, we can take on Man City and Arsenal in the league and Man Utd in the cup with an element of bravery and game plan, but travel over the park and we always melt, no matter the players in their team or ours, no matter who the manager is. I'm glad Bill got to attend a home match for his favoured team.\nAs Jim Bennings noted, it's appalling and shameful that any side never mind an Everton team has only scored one league goal from open play in 10 league games â€“ I'm taking Jim's word for that by the way.\nWe go again on Saturday, and let's be honest it always was a more important game than the derby; however, I did expect that the team would give a reasonable account of themselves over the park, but they didn't so yet again they owe the travelling fans big time.\n131 Posted 14/02/2023 at 00:43:14\nFine margins.\n132 Posted 14/02/2023 at 00:59:55\nStill gutted, and that was watching from home. I always feel sick after a defeat, and especially one where we didn't appear to offer any modicum of threat.\n133 Posted 14/02/2023 at 01:01:21\nWhere was the fight? Where was the passion? It was a derby for Christ's sake. One yellow card... pathetic. Both goals...take the player out! Don't let him run through... take him down! God, I hate modern football.\n134 Posted 13/02/2023 at 01:24:18\nSecond goal: why Coady let it go and made no attempt to clear it? I am not sure if he thought it would turn into an own goal if he touched it.\nI believe we missed Calvert-Lewin more than we thought as, when he was winning balls, he was bringing the midfield in whereas Simms was winning balls but they turned mostly into 50/50 balls that the other team was winning.\nWe all knew that when Dyche came it was not going to be easy, but I think 3 points from the last 2 games was really more than we expected. With the players we have and the way they were managed they deserve to be were they are, the other team with the players they have should be higher and it showed with the subs on the bench.\nI think that Dyche will give the same message as the last game: forget that game, let's prepare for the next one, each one becomes more important than the last one.\n135 Posted 14/02/2023 at 01:33:52\nVery sensible post.\n136 Posted 14/02/2023 at 01:36:37\nI've just seen the goals on the OS, it could so easily have been Everton taking the lead, but why didn't Gueye just take out the the guy on the break and what was Pickford doing so far off his line in no-mans land?\nAs you say, Coady should have dealt with that ball that went across the 6-yard box. As for Tom's miss, it was pretty poor from a Premier League player, although heading has never been his forte.\nReading between the lines it sounds as if Dominic might be missing on Saturday too, which is a huge blow for us. He might not be at his best but he's a great deal better than anyone else we have in the squad.\nDyche may have to alter his game plan, because Simms doesn't appear to be the right type of player to fill Calvert-Lewin's position.\n137 Posted 14/02/2023 at 01:45:35\n2) Our corner kick looks dangerous. Again that long deep ball to Tarkowski was almost a goal. It's unfortunate it hits the post and we get countered and go one down. It doesn't change the fact that we're more lethal in the set-piece environment. Just force more corner kicks going forward.\n3) Still very susceptible to counter-attack. We've lost too many of these kind of transition goals. Dyche has to re-think whether it is worth pulling one more player back in those situation.\n4) Playing at Anfield is going to be difficult. But we have our chances and, if the players can execute better (eg, Davies's header), it could be a different outcome.\n138 Posted 14/02/2023 at 01:55:35\nI was surprised that Gueye even managed to keep up with Sala and Nunez but he was one step behind them and if he took him out there would have been no doubt he would have got a red card.\n139 Posted 14/02/2023 at 02:01:52\nI don't think he would have got a red if had have taken the lad (Nunez?) out near the halfway line but, as at it was at their place, it probably would have led to a sending-off.\n140 Posted 14/02/2023 at 02:05:20\nIf you are a supporter, you will watch them wherever they play. DAZN show the Championship games.\nMe, I just will not watch the Premier League if Everton are not there.\n141 Posted 14/02/2023 at 02:13:23\nLook at the highlights: Gueye was a couple of yards off one side of Nunez and slightly behind, the same question could be asked why Coleman never took Robertson out for the second goal.\n142 Posted 14/02/2023 at 02:23:15\nThe ease that other teams break through our midfield is scary and we simply can't afford to play high up and commit too much because we are wide open to breaks. We can't pass the ball either, as seen again by Tarkowski and Gueye, and then we have Davies header which sums up both the players lack of ability and the coaching that has gone on at Finch Farm for years.\nThere's not a decent goalscorer in the squad. Even Dyche is probably shocked how poorly equipped we are and how big the challenge is.\nLeeds is a must win. Anything else is denial of where it's heading.\n143 Posted 14/02/2023 at 02:47:06\nSubs not Used: Begovic, Patterson, Townsend, Tosun, Gomes, Branthwaite.\nThe above was the line-up this time last year when Everton defeated Leeds United three-nil, Gray was out injured. The decision not to bring in any type of attacking reinforcements in the January window has undermined an already difficult task and I can hardly believe that the hierarchy at the club have been so negligent.\nI remain hopeful that we can keep our place in the Premier League, but I fear that the lack of goals and actual attacking threat will take us down. Every other side I've watched in the last few weeks has a way of creating and taking chances, I see nothing in our squad that does the same for Everton.\n144 Posted 14/02/2023 at 02:55:34\nOur defending of counter-attacks has been lamentable all season, we were shoddy in possession again, there were inexplicable errors from senior players (again!) and we had to play young Simms isolated up in attack.\nThe failure to sign a striker in January should have led to someone being sacked â€“ but this is Everton, where lack of accountability and incompetence have gone hand in hand and usually result in a payrise.\nBut, we took 3 points from 2 games where we probably expected zero. If you look at the fixture list of the clubs around us, they have tough games coming up. It will come down to securing the 5-6 wins we need by targeting our home games and 1-2 key away games.\n145 Posted 14/02/2023 at 03:46:41\nWe seemed to change our game from the performance against Arsenal and until the 70th minute did not seem to get players forward or press them in their half, indeed we seemed to drop back into our own half whenever we lost possession. Our midfield where nowhere to be found and McNeil and Doucoure were rubbish, Iwobi was off his game, Gana's lack of pace and limitations were shown up, and Onana had nobody to play with. If anyone was worse than McNeil and Doucoure it was the invisible man, Coady.\nMcNeil, to me, was responsible for the first goal and should have lashed it at goal but wouldn't have even hit the target if Doucoure's heels hadn't got in the way while he wasn't watching the ball. You couldn't really blame Pickford as he had three unmarked red shirts on the edge of his box and gambled on it beating the first man which it didn't and otherwise could only have made it slightly more difficult had he not taken the gamble. Their second was just piss-poor defending.\nSimms had a poor game but got little if any support, should have done better early on with a half chance but every time he tried to win the ball with his back to goal and on his own he seemed barged in the back which the referee let go every time. The pace of Gray might have helped out while Maupay didn't add anything either.\nThe big question for me is why we didn't press them in their half earlier in the game or were we frightened of their pace on the break. Still, if Tarkowski's header goes in instead of against the post, then we might have seen a totally different result.\n146 Posted 14/02/2023 at 04:05:12\nOn the other hand, even if we somehow miraculously stay up, what's so depressing about watching us today is just how little class we have in our squad. With Calvert-Lewin perpetually injured, the only two players with any promise are Pickford and Onana. Pickford can't score goals and Onana is still quite young.\nMaybe somehow we stay up and we sign a new striker and creative midfielder, and maybe Godfrey and Branthwaite hold down the central defense, and maybe Patterson takes a step up, and maybe Garner gets healthy and shows his quality. Maybe Mills and Warrington and Price and Welch will be ready.\nBut boy is it hard to find hope right now playing Gana (looks slow and has little skill on the ball), Iwobi out wide (where he looked lost for about two years), Doucoure (until he gets a run of games will look awful and even then will not be Premier League level with that touch), and on and on. Just so little quality.\nFor us to have any chance, we'll have to win about 5 games 1-0, scoring on headers off corners. It will be painful to watch however this goes down. I really wish I could be more optimistic, and I still have a bit of hope due to Dyche, but not much. But I'm wedded to this club no matter what, so onward we go.\n147 Posted 14/02/2023 at 04:53:05\nBut that isn't why we lost, it was because too many players had bad games way before he came on and which may be down to changing the game plan from the last game. At best, and possibly clutching at straws, we lost because a header hit the post. Whichever, a really disappointing performance all round!\n148 Posted 14/02/2023 at 05:20:45\nI hope after tonight that Dyche drops some of these players for the Leeds game. I would drop both full-backs and bring Mina in for Coady.\n149 Posted 14/02/2023 at 05:23:22\nThat has been exacerbated by the ongoing injuries to our sole goal-scoring striker (but then he is ridiculed by many fans anyway just because of the way he chooses to dress off the field).\nNumerous posters lauded these decisions and said that we were lucky to be rid of them. How lucky do we all feel now?\nIf you strip all the goals and assists from a squad, then you will be in a relegation fight every season.\n150 Posted 14/02/2023 at 05:53:21\nCutting through all the bullshit and analytical bollocks, I've come to the simple conclusion ofâ€¦\nWe're simply fucking rubbish.\n151 Posted 14/02/2023 at 06:43:18\n152 Posted 14/02/2023 at 06:48:41\nBecause the club management remained the same throughout, there was never a serious attempt to spec up on the skills to prepare the squad. Continuous financial mismanagement meant it was difficult to improve the squad, particularly as the best players were sold off, never to be replaced.\nTransfer windows turned into last minute hunts for bargains, or loans when they did not materalise. Even they proved difficult as the reputation of the Club was indirectly trashed by the fake news of the Board.\nYou can only cry wolf for so long in trying to motive enough to fightback. Maybe Dyche can do enough to survive in the Premier League. He deserves our support in this difficult situation. He will try his best and the supporters will give him their full support. It would be a great help if the Board stayed away from games, we could do without distractions as could Dyche and the players.\nIt is all very difficult for the Fans. It is obvious that the team and the manager needs our unconditional support, but we need to see changes within the club to those that got us into this position, simply because we need to feel that our efforts are worthwhile after numerous disappointments.\nIt is no use Moshiri doing pullover interviews to pull one over on the fans that the present regime is adequate for survival in the Premier League when we all know that it is not.\nUnfortunately this is where I see the situation as being at. A roller-coaster run-in to the end of the season is guaranteed, but maybe if Dyche can keep going with our support, we might have yet another chance of survival, and something might change in the club management. It is long overdue.\n153 Posted 14/02/2023 at 06:58:44\n\"United we stand but divided we fall\" is a powerful statement. IMO, every board member should attend at least every remaining home game this season.\nIf we go down, then so be it, but they'll have no real excuse from the blame that comes at them for the wasted years.\n154 Posted 14/02/2023 at 07:07:43\nPickford didn't have a great night. He's an erratic keeper, and you can't have that at any level of the game. First thing I'd do as manager is put Begovic as first choice.\nHis getting mugged off during the handbags at the end of the game was almost as bad as his positioning for the goals. Our last derby for a few years and we've gone out getting laughed at.\n155 Posted 14/02/2023 at 07:17:40\nHe has the same number of assists this season as the rest of the squad combined.\n156 Posted 14/02/2023 at 07:29:17\nNo manager comes in and changes a team which loses every week into a team which wins every week. He is still working with poor players and I fully expect the remainder of the season to resemble a patchwork quilt.\nSeamus isn't fast enough anymore to play fair. He should have strangled both attacks for the RS goals at birth by introducing a darker side to his game. An RS player wouldn't have thought twice.\nMykolenko kind of proved his good performance last week was an exception as opposed to the rule.\nTawkowski and Coady are a truly lamentable pairing. I've got slugs on my patio that would do both of them over 20 yards.\nTarkowski is showing why he battles relegation so often. Unnecessary fouls, staggeringly poor passing and an over-active anal nerve in the face of a decent press.\nCoady talks a decent game, but I don't think I have ever seen a centre-half have so many \"quiet\" games. How does he manage that in such a poor team? He's like a Jeff Beck song. Everywhere and nowhere.\nIf these two are not dropped, or at least separated, we have had it.\nI felt sorry for young Simms. He's probably thinking, \"If this is the service and support you get in the first team, you can shove it!\"\nMcNeil is neat and tidy, but he needs to be put on a diet of raw meat.\nI'm reluctant to talk about Tom Davies. I logged on here before the match to see the usual suspects had been doing their usual moronic derby day ritual of ignoring the hated enemy and dedicating their time to hammering the guy they have such a morbid obsession with... but there is something which can't be ignored anymore.\nNobody will ever confuse Tom Davies with a guy who can finish, but why does he get so many chances? Why does a player whose game time over the last two seasons has been restricted to the odd cameo appearance get more chances than Onana, Gana, Doucoure etc put together?\nThese guys could all learn something from Davies. He seems to have been watching the lottery adverts and understands the concept that you have to be in it to win it. In the absence of a striker, these guys have really got to understand the importance of being in it. I can't remember the last time any of them got a chance in the box from open play.\nMuch to do for Mr Dyche. So little time to do it. He will have learned as much last night as he did in the Arsenal game.\nTwo games in and he's already seen the good, the bad, and the downright fucking ugly.\n157 Posted 14/02/2023 at 07:51:44\nIt's not often a goalkeeper judges a situation so badly that he loses his bearings enough to allow a striker an unobstructed view of both goalposts.\nAnyway. Anger unloaded.\nWe go again.\n158 Posted 14/02/2023 at 07:56:26\nTom Davies might not be the best player in the world. But he always shows for the ball, looks to make a progressive pass, has positional discipline when needed, and makes well-timed runs. He missed the header, but his movement was great. I would take that all day over the discredited senior players we have had in midfield over the last 7 years.\nI nearly passed out seeing one of our midfield making a dangerous run into the box.\n159 Posted 14/02/2023 at 07:58:10\nPickford may have misjudged it but, in his defence, he was clearly anticipating the ball going to the player beyond Salah. If the ball had reached that player and had Pickford saved it, he would have no doubt been hailed a genius.\nHowever, perhaps, the fault also should be directed to those further up the field.\nAlso, to anyone thinking Davies should have scored with the header, if any of the best headers in the world had managed to score from that angle with a defender and goalie to beat, it would have been a wonder goal.\n160 Posted 14/02/2023 at 08:05:40\nSad to see the board having an outing last night and still no real comment on headlock-gate. Did they feel safe at Anfield but not at Goodison? Pitiful and shameful.\n161 Posted 14/02/2023 at 08:12:45\nHaving said that, I thought we were decent-ish in the first half. They had almost zero chances until that breakaway and, had Tarkowski's header gone a few inches to the right, it would have been a very different game.\nCoady inexplicably leaving that cross gave them an embarrassing second and then they grew in confidence and we receded. This Everton don't have the manager or players to score 2 goals or more often so going behind in matches will spell trouble.\nAgainst Leeds, we have to hope that Calvert-Lewin is back and I'd bring in Mina (or even Keane) for the unhelpful Coady and probably Godfrey at one of the full-back spots.\nRelegation wise, it's better for us to lose to the RS and beat Leeds than the other way around. Hoping the blunt performance last night gives rise to a thundering win on the weekend.\n162 Posted 14/02/2023 at 08:16:24\nRealistically we should have been relegated last season, and this season's team is worse. I think the manager will need to make a number changes for Saturday, including finding a solution to our centre forward position. Hard to see any positives from this performance.\n163 Posted 14/02/2023 at 08:18:27\nOn last night's game, I expected us to lose. We rarely do anything there (apart from the Covid game) and it was just the match for them to get back to winning ways.\nIt seemed from the off that every Red played fell over at the slightest contact and the ref went along with the script. On the other hand, if our lads went down, it was ignored. Slowly, they became more cofident and we retreated into our shells.\nTarkowski hit the post and the series of poor shots set them up. A crafty striker might have gambled on the rebound. A winger with balls might have hammered Simms's pass at goal, but Mc Neil somehow passed it against the gormless Doucoure.\nTheir break could and should have been nipped in the bud. Our lads are just not cynical or ruthless enough.\nTarkowski got his head to most things and for an hour did well but, l don't know if he tired but the last 20 mins he was like Bambi on Ice.\nI am another who doesn't really understand why Coady is in the team. He was culpable again for the second goal but seemed to do nothing all game.\nI thought Mykolenko was one of our better players. McNeil did little to cover him and he was often on the back foot, but he dug us out of some awkward situations several times.\nOnana went missing for long periods. I though Gana did okay but the biggest problem was Iwobi constantly giving the ball away. He did it at both ends of the pitch.\nWe would have been better off going with 4-4-2 as Matip was nervous and we rattled him a few times early on.\nSimms looks out of his depth and with nobody within 5 yards must have forgotten to brush his teeth.\nI presume Dyche earmarked Leeds for Calvert-Lewin. The lad is going to be treated with kid gloves and, without him, we are toast.\nLeeds brought in that Gnonto kid, full of pace and agression with an eye for goal. We will struggle to cope with him. If only we could have signed him for ١.8 million.\n164 Posted 14/02/2023 at 08:23:51\nI can see where you are coming from; I suppose it is avoidance in my case, since I am thoroughly sickened by what has happened over the years. Yes, they should stand at games and at least and face the reality, like the rest of us.\nI was having breakfast in a hotel in Glasgow this morning. At the next table were three workers in high-vis vests, all from Liverpool. They supported Liverpool and were glad of the win, since the team had been playing so badly lately.\nThey said they had friends who were Evertonians who they used to have the batter with. Because things are so bad, that does not happen anymore. I told them I didn't think Liverpool played well and the goals were soft goals. They all agreed.\n165 Posted 14/02/2023 at 08:24:11\nWhen the cross came in, he was stood near the penalty spot, when he should have been more by the 6-yard line, but then this would have given Salah even more time to control the ball and slot it past Pickford.\nWatching the goal from behind, there are actually three RS players in a central position without a defender near them, and anyone of those three would have scored. So, while it looks bad from a positional sense, I doubt very much Pickford would have saved the goal if he had been further back, and also not made a move to his left.\n166 Posted 14/02/2023 at 08:25:45\nI'm all for defending Tom, but that was a ball he saw for about 20 yards. It wasn't a difficult skill. His execution was pretty awful for a top-level player.\n167 Posted 14/02/2023 at 08:40:04\nThis isn't an example of a decent Everton team shitting its pants or Dyche getting tactics wrong or any such nonsense.\nThis is an example of a team with absolutely no attacking threat being taken apart by a team with Gakpo, Salah and Nunez (with Jota and Firminho on the bench).\nOf course in the process of losing there were individual errors. But unfortunately without Calvert-Lewin and a home crowd, this wasn't going to be a good game for us.\nWe are where we are primarily because of the quality of our squad â€“ and the weakest attack in the division by some measure. Much inferior to Bournemouth, Saints and Forest.\nThey were underperforming under Lampard but not by much.\n168 Posted 14/02/2023 at 08:45:12\nPut aside the fact that it was the RS last night. Much more important than bragging rights is avoiding relegation. So, in that context, 3 points from 6 from the last two games, against teams significantly higher in the table, is very acceptable. Very acceptable.\nSo, on to the Leeds and Villa games, with a test for Dyche to get this lot up for it again.\n169 Posted 14/02/2023 at 08:52:02\nIwobi looks a fraction of the player he was last season in the centre and I really think we need to accommodate him back there again or drop him. As for McNeil, I cannot for the life of me understand what he offers as a footballer: no pace, no football intelligence, no skill, no creativity. Absolutely woeful.\nOnce again, the board have left us absolutely bereft of attacking options and sadly I'm struggling to see us scoring enough goals to keep us afloat this season. Bad times and absolutely atrocious mismanagement of our beloved club.\nUp the Blues, sack the Board.\n170 Posted 14/02/2023 at 09:00:50\nThey might not be the best options but the fact that we have no choice but to throw in Ellis Simms, who at 22 is no longer a bright prospect but already seems to be destined for a Championship career or lower, shows we are a club from a bygone era.\nThe Premier League has shifted up another notch, It's now become the de facto Super League, and we are simply not fit for purpose. Even the most recent change in the rules â€“ allowing five subs â€“ seems to have caught us by surprise. We have nothing on the bench, and it's not because of injuries â€“ we haven't had many of those yet, but surely will â€“ it's because we are the only team in the Premier League not to have strengthened in response to that rule change.\nIn all honesty, it breaks my heart, but we deserve to go down. We are not good enough, and it's the club's own fault.\nI'll still be turning up to watch us play the likes of Reading and Hull, but the fans have been let down in the most unacceptable way by those in charge at the club.\n171 Posted 14/02/2023 at 09:05:33\nThere is a reason why Doucoure has been nowhere near the first team; he must give the ball away with every touch, treats the ball like a hot potato.\nI felt sorry that Simms had to be hung out to dry like that, although he could have looked like he wanted to be there.\nThere is absolutely no chance that squad of players has it in them to stay in this league. From what I have seen of the other teams, Leeds will run them ragged this Saturday and game over. It would take a miracle and it's not going to happen from a known squad of bottle jobs who panic when they get in the opposition's half.\n172 Posted 14/02/2023 at 09:05:48\nLast night was dire and does not bode well for the up coming games and the Arsenal win was a welcome relief but quite fortunate on the day. Two hard-earned draws, with better consecutive displays, I would have preferred in a way.\nHowever, that extra point against Arsenal may be the one that keeps us up in May. \"Fortunes turn on a sixpence\"... and all that.\n173 Posted 14/02/2023 at 09:24:33\nA very good post, Darren, until you got to Tom Davies, mate. You know I don't mind Tom, and I can also understand why you constantly back him up, but if that's in training, he would score, or make the keeper work every single time, although I definitely agree that this isn't the reason we lost the game.\nWe lack so much professionalism: two clever fouls and Liverpool don't cut us open twice on the counter-attack. But we lack more than anything the desire to roll up our sleeves, immerse ourselves in the game, and play with the effort and desire, that means you will enjoy it. In other wordsâ€¦ Feint â€“ not Faint.\n174 Posted 14/02/2023 at 09:25:43\nWe needed to keep it tight and score first. We had no focal point up front â€“ no criticism of Simms, who worked hard. They did to us what we did to Arsenal. Both goals were poor from our view.\nOnto the next game.\nLast night changes nothing. We're in a 16-game mini-league. It's in our hands.\n175 Posted 14/02/2023 at 09:26:18\nWhat intrigues me is the obsession that some posters have with our players' dress sense and how they feel it is an issue. Like we would be top four without this unsavoury girliness.\nToo much protesting, I think.\n176 Posted 14/02/2023 at 09:32:13\nWe critically lack creativity and firepower and it's anyone's guess if we will stay up. Dyche will try his best to get them to fight but our fate is now in the lap of the gods. If we go down Dyche will be responsible for rebuilding the entire shitshow of a team, what a monumental task that will be.\n177 Posted 14/02/2023 at 09:45:49\nI think your point about separating Coady and Tarkowski is really important — I think this will be one of the main factors in us staying up.\n178 Posted 14/02/2023 at 09:47:51\nAbsolutely he should have buried it, or at least make the keeper work. No arguments from me, but that's not really the point I was making.\nI want to know why he gets so many chances despite so little game time, when others who play far more regularly treat the opposition box as a complete no-go zone.\nAndy Crooks.@175. Final sentence;\nNail. Head\n179 Posted 14/02/2023 at 09:51:40\nLast season, we had Richarlison and Calvert-Lewin for some of the time and their goals largely kept us up. But we lose Richarlison in June and our manager and our DOF decide we need a new centre-bck pairing and 4 midfield players who don't score goals.\nThen Calvert-Lewin gets injured a week before the season starts. So we start the season with McNeil as the leading striker, then change that to Gordon. This was 5 games before we bought Maupay whose goal-per-game ratio is awful, so how was that going to solve the problems of scoring goals?\nWe have won 2 of 27 away games, and are the lowest goal scorers in the Premier League; how Dyche changes this, I shudder to think.\nI would argue that both Tarkowski and Coady are no better than what we had, and it's arguable that they are in fact worse than what we had.\nIn midfield, we have a 6ft-4in player who should be christened 'Anonymous' as he disappears for large portions of games he has played. People tell me he has potentialâ€¦ well, that may be so, but we need players who can perform now â€“ not in 12 months time.\nI felt sorry for Simms, he was given little or no support; I suspect he was relieved to be taken off.\nHow you let a side break on you so easily for the first goal is unprofessional. As soon as the ball was played out of the box by them, we should have fouled the player in possession and stopped the move right away. I am sick and tired of Iwobi and McNeil, who carry no goal threat and play more like auxiliary fullbacks.\nSean Dyche will have to work miracles to keep us from relegation, even the clubs around us have goals in them. Our only chance is from a corner-kick or a free-kick.\n180 Posted 14/02/2023 at 09:52:03\nIwobi looks like the boy playing in front of his pushy parents and is too scared to do anything in case he makes a mistake. Someone needs to get inside his head and I'm not being flippant. He has a psychological issue preventing him from playing without fear. It needs addressing so we can unlock the talent that is clearly in the lad.\n181 Posted 14/02/2023 at 10:00:28\nLast night the RS had 6 strikers to pick from we had 1 â€“ an untested kid: Sarah, Gakpo, Jota, Firminho, Nunes and soon-to-be-back Diaz. Probably a few good U21s tooâ€¦\nThis club needs a new board and new investment fast.\n182 Posted 14/02/2023 at 10:12:04\nThose who are resilient: Coady, Tarkowski, Mykolenko, Coleman, Gana aren't good enough. Those who are good enough: Gray, Iwobi, Calvert-Lewin aren't resilient.\nThen there are those who are neither good enough nor resilient â€“ pretty much the rest of them.\nI find it hard to fully explain what I mean and certainly don't have the answers â€“ let's hope Dyche and his team do. At this point, Michael Keane upfront would provide more chance of goals than any of the fit forwards at the club.\n183 Posted 14/02/2023 at 10:16:48\nI don't think I've ever seen an Everton performance where so many players just gifted the ball straight to a red shirt. Coady seems to think he is Beckenbauer, spraying passes but they go straight to the opposition or in touch. Coleman played it straight to a Liverpool midfield player in the centre of the park under no pressure. I lost count how many times Tarkowski just surrendered the ball.\nI've never understood the high regard that Idrissa Gueye was held in during his first spell but his second spell has been an umitigated disaster. He consistently passes backwards or surrenders possession and, when the opposition break, it's like he's running in treacle.\nIf you showed me the positions of the players from the first goal and I didn't know who the two teams were, I would know that it was Everton who conceded that goal. Remember the Man Utd game at home when Iwobi lost it in a good position and 15 seconds later, Ronaldo buries it in front of the Gwladys Street End?\nIt happens so many times. Villa away at the start of the season. Why are we so vulnerable when we're in their half of the field in good positions? The reason, I suspect is that we have too many slow players.\nI didn't get caught up in the euphoria of the win against Arsenal because the RS, even with their recent travails, are 100 times better than we are. That's just fact. They have better footballers.\nDyche needs to find a solution to the Calvert-Lewin conundrum because, even when he's on the pitch, he's largely ineffective.\nIt's going to have to be down to the Goodison faithful to rally the players. Again.\n184 Posted 14/02/2023 at 10:19:46\nIf 4-4-2 is an option, though, I would go with this v Leeds:\nPickford\nPatterson Mina Tarkowski Godfrey\nGray Onana Davies McNeil\nIwobi Maupay (assuming sparrer legs isn't fit)\n185 Posted 14/02/2023 at 10:28:34\nHowever, the bottom line is we have got to score more goals. And to do that, we have to create a lot more chances.\nI certainly agree with your earlier comment that Allan is a big miss this season. My theory is we wanted his wages off the books.\n186 Posted 14/02/2023 at 10:34:51\nI agree after last night that the central midfield needs reshaping but you leave Onana in the side and drop Gana and Doucoure?\nWhile none of them played well last night, Onana was the least effective, he gets plenty of praise on here as a future great player. To me, he stands out as being very frugal with his talent which he hides very well.\n187 Posted 14/02/2023 at 10:43:45\nGood points from Darren, great perspective from Brent. We lost a match. Hard work ahead but we are not toast or done.\nI'm sat next to a London kopite on the train home who I told to remove his hat. He did. We had a conversation and both agreed, we were not far off them last night. The difference is what we all know. We are toothless and have no goal threat. They do, but they are in decline as a team.\nI don't really do the player rating thing, but just to put a few thoughts out there.\nPickford, despite his increasing maturity and making a couple of outstanding saves, lost his head. He is a frustrated figure. At one point, and not for the first time in the last few matches, I thought he was going to join me in the Anfield Road as he walked towards the Evertonians. I was shouting for him to turn around and focus on the pitch!\nLiverpool's style of switching and playing wide meant the fullbacks were always in for a hard shift. I thought Mykolenko had a good game and Seamus gave everything and more as always.\nOnana was our best player again, in my opinion. Gueye done what he does and broke the game up. Iwobi seems to be going back to that player who is confused and doesn't know what to do. Maybe it's because there is nothing in front of him.\nI don't get the Tom Davies thing. Okay, he fluffed his big moment, but he didn't do a lot wrong and by the time he came on, he had little opportunity to impact the game.\nI thought Tarkowski done as well as he could and won a lot of challenges. Coady was poor. I know I'm a sucker for punishment, but hearing the Kopites in the Arkles cheer him on watching the highlights was nerve-tingling. I was a lone voice.\nOnto Simms. The boy done well but was totally isolated and had no-one to play off him.\nSmall margins. That one goes in off the post and we win that.\nLet's get up for the next one.\nWe didn't play badly. We lost a derby and I'm hurting as much as anyone. But I see improvement in the effort and commitment.\nStill confused about the over-the-top police presence. We're all relatives.\n188 Posted 14/02/2023 at 10:55:19\nJust on another point that Danny touched on, I wasn't at the game but saw quite a few pictures posted before the game showing a heavy police and stewards seemingly preventing our fans getting to the turnstiles â€“ this was 30 minutes before kick-off.\nNo doubt most of the sports channels will be covering Uefa's report into the authorities were totally to blame for Liverpool supporters with tickets not being allowed to enter the ground for their Champions League final in Paris. Maybe some questions need to be asked as to why this happened? And I believe the same thing happened last season, so why?\n189 Posted 14/02/2023 at 10:58:50\nTry and grow up and stop showing your ignorance. Jim when would a pain-killing injection cure a hamstring injury?\nJerome #108,\nI believe Calvert-Lewin would have made a huge difference, no disrespect to Simms, he's not as physical and as mobile as Dom. I don't blame him, no experience in the Premier League.The board hung the manager out to dry, knowing a striker was a must in the window.\nI felt sorry for Coleman and Mykolenko they were overrun with Arnold and Robertson overlapping with Iwobi and McNeil passengers. I'd still start Holgate and Godfrey at full-back on Saturday with Mina and Tarkowski or Keane.\nHope Garner is fit, and would start Davies ahead of Doucoure, and Iwobi on the bench. Calvert-Lewin is vital, if he's not fit we're in big bother.\nHope the board stay away, we're the worst-run club in the Premier League, and to sell Richarlison and Gordon for 㿙M, 4 days before the window closed and not to bring in a couple of forwardsâ€¦ astonishing.\nThe redshite complaining over the report after the Champions League final, after what happened in Paris, 30 years after Hillsborough, no problem with that, but they seemed to forget to mention that Heysel did happen\n190 Posted 14/02/2023 at 11:01:25\nHow many Norwegian relatives have you got?\n191 Posted 14/02/2023 at 11:05:51\nThe margin was huge, a fucking abyss of difference in speed and quality. It was really disappointing and there is a real demonstrable chance we will be relegated. I'm preparing emotionally for it.\n192 Posted 14/02/2023 at 11:25:16\nI don't think I saw one tackle yesterday unless I missed it. After apparently having Peter Reid in this week to rile them up, I expected to at least be first to every second ball or at least show them we were up for it, but we did neither.\nAlthough the first 20 minutes were quite tight, and Liverpool looked for once more nervous than we did, there was a breakaway where, as soon as we got to the edge of their box we shit ourselves. I could see the mind set change from both sides in that moment, they thought \"They have nothing\" and we agreed; game therefore handed over on a silver platter.\n193 Posted 14/02/2023 at 11:38:58\nI got taken aside for a search with a search dog and I'm one of the most passive people you will meet.\nI complied but they made it very difficult. Even around the streets of Goodison. A good job I kept my calm because a lot were getting antagonised.\nOnly Speke and Garston, Paul. Grandparents from Belfast and Glasgow. Inlaws I can claim Northern Ireland and the West Midlands, but none are Evertonians. Quite a few Kopites in that mix though.\n194 Posted 14/02/2023 at 11:41:00\nI think the fall from grace has finally reached rock bottom.\nAlthough relegation is a horrible thought, I can't see any other outcome with this team, they don't deserve to stay up.\n195 Posted 14/02/2023 at 11:50:31\nThe first one is world class. It's the sort of goal modern coaches dream about, and the speed of the Liverpool forwards is undefendable. They would have scored that goal against any opposition.\nThe second is just terrible. Really really poor. If I was Tarkowski, I would not have been happy with Coady there, he was a bag of shite.\n196 Posted 14/02/2023 at 11:57:38\nWe can't play a high line with the talent available to us unless we drop Coady and play Godfrey. When Patterson is fit he come in but until then we have to keep going with Seamus.\nWe can get by with our midfield options, perhaps plat Iwobi in behind Calvert-Lewin or Simms but not in an area where if he loses possession that we have a major problem. Have we a player at the club who is happy to sit in front of the back four and stay there for the duration of the game?\nWe lost Charlie and Gordon and have Simms, Maupay and McNeil, therefore, we are weaker up top than at the end of last season.\nA big task to stay up but it can be done, however, it's going to be a battle.\nWhen Bournemouth needed a hand we were there to help them out, when Wolves, Southampton, West Ham and Liverpool needed a similar helping hand, we delivered, next up Leeds Utd, we cannot afford to lose next Saturday afternoon.\n197 Posted 14/02/2023 at 12:15:39\nWe would require 3 new strikers, and at least 3 new midfielders (no one is gonna take Davies or Gana). Onana will be gone, and thankfully Pickford. Coady can piss off back to Wolves and hopefully Seamus realises it really is time to call it a day before blubbering Bill gives him an extended contract until he's 40, as he Gets Everton and he's one of us.\nSince 1977 been following this club, even the 4 years we were good the custodians never built on it. Decades of neglect, living on a few past glories from many years ago is finally showing, and the way back will be very-very difficult.\nI'm not being a doom merchant, but how do we expect a team that doesn't score goals (and hasn't since Marco Silva) to start winning games.\nI've just seen the Davies miss again, its incredible.\n198 Posted 14/02/2023 at 12:36:13\n199 Posted 14/02/2023 at 12:43:34\nThere is no pace on the ball. If you watch it, the cross dies on him in the last 5 yards and he loses the track of it.\nIf it was Trevor Steven sending that ball over it stays on its trajectory and with twice the pace.\n201 Posted 14/02/2023 at 12:45:06\nIf we are going to play 4-4-2, then the two up front should be forwards. Two of Calvert-Lewin, Simms and Maupay.\n202 Posted 14/02/2023 at 13:13:30\nI should be wiser now I'm older, because although I expected us to lose last night, it's the fact that our board, have made quite a few headlines today, that makes me feel both angry, and nauseous.\nWhat's it going to take for Bill Kenwright, to fuck off, Relegation?\nTalking of relegation, it's a massive fear, but my own personal feelings are that it is probably going to be the best way for Everton football club, to have a complete reset. I'm aware we could be financially fucked, but I also believe we are emotionally fucked, and after giving quite a lot of thought to it over the last few very boring years, I'm definitely prepared to take my chances, on Everton rebounding as a much stronger and more positive club.\nQuite simply, I'm prepared to try anything if it means we can finally get rid of the absolute and inept poison, that have led us for way to many horribly boring years.\nLook at our forwards. Talk about playing 4-4-2, and then look at what you have got to play it. No wonder we are in such a bad position.\n203 Posted 14/02/2023 at 13:51:37\n204 Posted 14/02/2023 at 14:04:37\nIf we do go down, the two sides who joined us, would likely be in a better position to be promoted automatically, we might have a chance of top six, but then would face the vagaries of play-offs and the gamble that we would return to the top flight at the first attempt, is too much even for the current owner and board to contemplate.\nThe board should do the right thing and step aside now, and allow some new blood to give some fresh ideas and input to a club that is failing so badly it defies logic.\nWe have 16 games to at least try and retain our top-flight status, it's a tough ask, but somehow the team and fans have to believe they can do it - if we don't, I really fear for the future of the club, financially and competitively.\nRelegation is a good thing? Don't make me laugh.\n205 Posted 14/02/2023 at 14:09:41\nPlenty of games left to turn this around. All is not lost if we don't beat Leeds but a scrappy 1-0 win would go down well.\n206 Posted 14/02/2023 at 14:26:43\n207 Posted 14/02/2023 at 14:34:06\nDavies missed a good chance, but to call it \"incredible\" makes you sound like you havent seen or played in a match before.\nChances of this nature are missed up and down the country every week.\nTalk up the missed opportunity all you like, but when Romelu Lukaku ( The guy you talk about so often) missed four easier chances in one single match in the world cup. You didnt say a word.\nUnlike TD. Lukaku is a striker. He wasnt having his first touch and he wasnt coming on cold with 10 minutes to go.\nLukaku missed four absolute sitters which meant the team many believed to be the most talented in the competition was going home. He didnt just let down a nation. he compounded it by crying like a baby because it hadnt gone his way.\nTHAT ! My friend, is what you call \"incredible\".\nSee the difference. ?\n208 Posted 14/02/2023 at 14:38:11\n209 Posted 14/02/2023 at 14:41:17\nI get helped out a lot. Friends and family get me tickets at face value. Some have to upgrade at minimal cost. Some give me them for free, which I don't always like. But always with honesty and trust.\nThe Kopite I spoke to this morning paid £450 to sit about 50 yards from me.\nNow I spend a lot of money on Everton, mainly on travel, but that is ridiculous.\nI almost felt for him.\nAlmost.\n210 Posted 14/02/2023 at 14:46:12\n211 Posted 14/02/2023 at 14:46:13\nThe only time that relegation would have been good was when Everton beat Wimbledon to survive relegation, when the Evertonian kiss the centre circle spot.I actually thought he would be a good thing then.\nHh?\nNow as you say it would be a disaster, drop in revenue, losing money already and coming under Football League Profitability rules, would sink the Club.\nMany delusional Evertonians refer to some Everton players as ' only Championship players', but the truth is they would struggle in the Championship.\nI would be surprised if aTony does not know all this anyway.We are in frustrating times.\n212 Posted 14/02/2023 at 14:52:42\nFrom open play we've seen some horrible misses from Doucoure and Davies and Calvert-Lewin should have had at least one vs Arsenal. Where are the goals going to come from?\n213 Posted 14/02/2023 at 14:59:02\nWe've just been twatted by the shite without a semi decent performance from anybody. We are battling what many believe to be a certain drop.\nYet after hammering Davies before the match despite the fact that he was never going to be selected. The only player they can talk about after the match is him The guy who was sent on when the game was already lost.\nI wonder if the obsessives actually watch the game or see this place as some sort of bag wash where they can come and bitch about their favorite hate figure.\nWe used to have such a Knowledgeable fan base. but a section has been replaced by a load of Dot Cotton`s telling us where we are REALLY going wrong..\n214 Posted 14/02/2023 at 15:06:40\nWhen we had a goal threat- and not that much of one- we had Richie, a fit DCL and Gordon. Now we have McNeil, Maupay, Iwobi and Simms. Go figure on that.\nWe also have some of the slowest players in the EPL. McNeil, Maupay, Coady, Doucoure, Coleman and others. You can hide one, maybe two but not half a team.\nAs with last year, we rely on 3 other teams being even worse. That's not remotely so certain this time around. Even the two most likely, Southampton and Bournemouth, have both beaten us handily recently. Who else is worse than us?\n215 Posted 14/02/2023 at 15:14:24\nThe reason I still talk about Lukaku is he was the last genuine goalscorering striker we've had in a very long time. RE the world cup thats on Martinez as he'd not started a match for weeks after an injury. He was too rusty to play.\nNothing else to say, we are all pissed off (again).\n216 Posted 14/02/2023 at 15:24:29\nIve never been a fan. I am an admirer of his courage, I think hes better than the likes of Doucoure and offers more to the team, but I have never claimed he was a good player. so please don't say it.\nI just get pissed off by posts like yours which totally ignore the shite in front of you to focus on a player who is only ever on the periphery.....Do you really think that miss was \"incredible\" ? or did you just say that because of who missed it. I suspect it was the latter.\nBreaking news...There are about 20 players who need to leave this club if we are to go forward.\nWhen players who don't play are bashed. it stops being about football.\n217 Posted 14/02/2023 at 15:26:22\nWe now hit a few games where we can contest it more like a 4411 / 442 with Simms and Maupay up top together. Gray can feature more too.\nSimms won't improve back on the bench or with fanciful / daft suggestions of playing Keane or Mina up front. He just needs a bit of help and Maupay can do that.\nWorth sticking with him if DCL is unfit. He's a very good finisher bâ°ut needs a chance to acclimatise to the big step up.\n218 Posted 14/02/2023 at 15:29:23\nThelwell tried but the problem at the club reared its ugly head and turned players away, with the prime example being the player who was ready to put his signature on a contract but turned round and went to Tottenham, there were other players who openly stated they preferred going to Southampton and Nottingham than Everton. This shocked me as I always believed that no player would turn down a chance to come to Everton.\nAbout last nights game, Everton should bring in a specialist to find out why Everton players freeze as soon as they step onto the Anfield pitch.\nWithout going into individual performances good or bad, there was no problems we were beaten before the K.O. by a better team that had most players on the bench that would get into an Evertons starting team.\nI suppose the crude way to describe Dyche's problem is, from following previous managers picking up dog shit , he has ended up behind a Team of Clydes - dales.\n219 Posted 14/02/2023 at 15:31:36\nRelegation would be a financial disaster. There is never a good time to get relegated from the Premier League. It would also mean the likes of Rob Halligan having to travel the length and breadth of the country for Friday and Monday night matches for televised games, as Sky always home in on fallen giants for maximum TV audiences for Championship games.\n220 Posted 14/02/2023 at 15:48:42\nBill 219 I absolutely agree that we need a sports psychologist to try and sort out why we freeze when we play at Anfield. I would suggest we need a psychologist to work permanently with our players, who seem to freeze on a regular basis.\nI know you said let's stop slamming Thelwell, but surely he has to take responsibility along with Lampard as to why we have so few alternatives to Calvert-Lewin.\n221 Posted 14/02/2023 at 15:53:48\nPerform like we did against Arsenal with the Goodison Park crowd and we'll be back on track. Not all doom and gloom, loads of games left and Leeds are just as much of a shambles as we are.\nBig game next!\n222 Posted 14/02/2023 at 15:55:54\nWe need more money and better players.\n223 Posted 14/02/2023 at 15:59:09\nWorried but not over.\nI also wonder if Palace might start to slip, someone usually does!\n224 Posted 14/02/2023 at 16:03:47\n225 Posted 14/02/2023 at 16:11:25\nRob, what will they see? I don't have a season ticket so can't check myself.\n226 Posted 14/02/2023 at 16:13:16\nI've just had a look but can't find anything that is 'shocking' unless you mean they have 19 games for next season penciled in? You'll have to be specific on what I'm looking for.\n227 Posted 14/02/2023 at 16:19:39\nMaybe not a shock as such, but it looks like the club are banking on definitely being in the Premier League next season. Suppose it's easily adjusted, to say Championship 2023-24 season!\n228 Posted 14/02/2023 at 16:23:03\nThe only real surprise is that they didn't put the losing scorelines down for the possible 'derby' dates.\n229 Posted 14/02/2023 at 16:25:56\nWe have won 4 games? We are not very good, don't have a striker, and play predictable long-ball footy.\n230 Posted 14/02/2023 at 16:31:36\nWe needed a point from last night's game really. In fact we can barely afford to do again what we've mostly done all season; lose.\n231 Posted 14/02/2023 at 16:41:01\nMaybe I do single Davies out, I can still see him passing to Mina in an offside position at Old Trafford rather than shooting late on. That would have won us the match and a win at Old Trafford for Rafa!\nHe lacks confidence; it's just unfortunate that a Premier League team regular would need this, and it's again a wrong decision years ago that he didn't go out on loan for a full season, probably around 2018.\nRe Doucoure, correct â€“ nowhere near enough goals in a position that requires more.\n232 Posted 14/02/2023 at 16:43:05\nHaving attended 50 consecutive Anfield league derbies before the pandemic, I have seen many worse performances than last night's.\nI did not see a lack of effort. There was a lack of quality in key moments of pressure and of course we continued to struggle to create chances in open play.\nIt was one of those performances in which our team would produce a moment of individual class but follow with a moment of individual error, usually in the final third where it really matters.\nSurvival will obviously be dependent on taking points from the teams close to us in the Premier League table. Those points would be of more value than for example the last four we gained against Man City and Arsenal.\nLosing to Bournemouth, Wolves, Southampton and West Ham has put us in an extremely perilous position. Indeed by virtue of denying opponents 2 points, four draws in those games would have put us in a relatively better place than we now find ourselves.\nThat means a win against Leeds on Saturday is imperative. They are another team against whom we dare not leave ourselves open to the counter-attack.\n233 Posted 14/02/2023 at 16:55:57\n50 consecutive league matches at Anfield. Take a bow! You deserve a medal. I don't know how your heart has withstood all that tension. I find it hard to watch any derby game â€“ home or away.\n234 Posted 14/02/2023 at 16:59:36\nThe fans in my view protested against the wrong target at the wrong time and it could end in relegation as a result given the winnable home games Lampard lost after Bournemouth. Not a popular opinion but undoubtedly correct.\n235 Posted 14/02/2023 at 17:02:35\n\"Not a popular opinion but undoubtedly correct.\"\nPure gold, Ian.\n236 Posted 14/02/2023 at 17:12:15\n237 Posted 14/02/2023 at 17:15:07\n238 Posted 14/02/2023 at 17:33:27\nThis pre-supposes that we, as supporters, can only consider one issue at one time and only in one mode. But not only is it possible to protest against the manager at the same time as protesting against the board, it is also possible to support the manager at the same time as protesting against the charlatans and nonentities who own and run our club. In fact, that is exactly what we are now doing.\nThis is what I describe as 'correct'...\n239 Posted 14/02/2023 at 17:38:07\nThere is no end to the stupidness of how this club has been run, with Bill Kenwright the main culprit, closely followed by our owner. I cannot stomach these people any more with their constant fuck-ups, lies and ignorance, so it's imperative that they leave the club regardless of our status next season.\nI would be happy with Kenwright and his board being replaced, though, so at a minimum, this has to happen. We should not let up on the protests.\nWe are about to go into a run of games that will be gut-wrenching for us all because of what's on the line but, at the same time, we don't really trust the team to get the job done, just as we saw against Liverpool.\nAs ever, the supporters will be there to try and lift them but we need a massive response against Leeds to get the 3 points. Dyche needs to find the formula to win this game.\nI reckon we will be lucky to score more than 12 goals for the rest of the season given the paucity of our team, so it's gonna be very very hard to find those wins. Critically. they must come against the teams around us to have any chance of survival.\n240 Posted 14/02/2023 at 17:40:53\nAs for the board, I don't want to go thereâ€¦ they are torture, this club.\n241 Posted 14/02/2023 at 17:53:30\nA lot of people believed it was a good decision to put Mina in with an unmissable chance, only it was the big Colombian who cocked it up by racing ahead of the ball when he could see right across the line.\nOut of the numerous horror shows we have witnessed over the past two seasons involving so many players, I find it curious that you can be so riled about that one.\nAt least you're honest, mate.\n242 Posted 14/02/2023 at 18:17:16\nI do have a question for you, Darren. If we go down, do you think Kenwright will finally leave?\n243 Posted 14/02/2023 at 18:20:52\n244 Posted 14/02/2023 at 18:27:18\nWe've never learnt to shift the ball around the pitch with pace and buy forwards who actually score lots of goals and entertain. Now, it looks like it will cost us our place in the Premier League. Thanks, Uncle Billâ€¦ King of Incompetence, he's the Benny Hill of Chairman.\nLiverpool have adapted but even they have only won the trophy just once which is woeful considering the amount of titles they won in the old system. Certainly not a record to be proud of.\nThe sight of Robertson running round like a demented Muppet is ugly X-rated football which has become their hallmark, it just about sums them up, as long as that is deemed acceptable and that goes for most of their players, ugly nasty bastards that the media love. I think they will eventually empty every ground in the country. If that's the new benchmark, the game is finished. Beautiful game, my arse!\n245 Posted 14/02/2023 at 18:28:52\nâ— Thelwell: the man tasked with improving a squad with no money, even after the forced sales of Gordon and Richarlison. The signings â€“ or the lack of them â€“ are because of our financial position. That's it.\nâ— Davies: the guy who hardly plays and when he does is generally no worse than the other (often big-earning) rubbish in midfield like Gomes, Allan, Doucoure, Gueye etc etc. Could have been a better player but has had a different manager or more every season since he broke through and the mess as much as anything held him back.\nâ— Calvert-Lewin: the guy who worked his socks off for years, turned himself into a top Premier League striker through hard work and then gets a quadricep injury and others which rules him out of a World Cup. Managed to keep us up last season with a superb header and a few important cameos. But wore a daft outfit in a magazine so is now a workshy fraud.\nThe culprits for this mess are the people who chucked all the money away about 5 years ago â€“ and the owners who allowed it to happen on their watch.\n246 Posted 14/02/2023 at 18:36:24\nYou'd have thought the past couple of weeks would be enough to make him walk. But to my eyes. He is taking 'brazen' to a height only the biggest ego could scale.\n247 Posted 14/02/2023 at 18:38:18\nThe board selling our best player, Richarlison, allowing Gordon to leave for 㿙M with four days left of the window, and not bringing in a forward with Calvert-Lewin injured, is one of the reasons we're in relegation bother.\nKenwright and the board putting out a report their lives were in danger if they turned up for the Southampton game, coincidently the same day as the fans sit in and protest.\nSurprise, surprise, the Mersey police knew nothing about any such threat, dragging the fans and EFC into the gutter, telling lies again to boost their own ego. That's why we are where we are â€“ 'The Board'.\n248 Posted 14/02/2023 at 19:03:01\nPete Taylor, Jeff Moorad and Jahm Najafi of MSP Sports Capital where in the stand also.\nKenwright didn't know they where attending?????\n249 Posted 14/02/2023 at 19:11:33\nI sometimes think our amateurishness has caught up with us, but the money is simply not there, clearly. I think the likes of Thelwell etc know the problem but can't do anything about it.\nToday, I have really wanted to find some positivity amidst the austerity but it's a challenge.\n250 Posted 14/02/2023 at 19:15:37\nI can't see us winning 6 home games and I think we're nailed on to get relegated. If we lose to Leeds, I think we're done.\n251 Posted 14/02/2023 at 19:24:05\n252 Posted 14/02/2023 at 20:00:48\nLampard spent the Richarlison money on Maupay, Onana and McNeil. That was down to Lampard as he always said he had final say on transfers. His signings, tactics, team selections and subs are the reason why we are Bottom 3.\nI'm not getting involved in the headlock / board not attending subject as it's totally irrelevant.\n253 Posted 14/02/2023 at 20:29:07\nWe should have joined you in all those Lampard Out demonstrations you organised. Good to see you are not casting it up to us. Your view only became unpopular after you repeated it on every thread night and day twenty million times and, for the love of fuck, are still repeating it after Lampard has been sacked.\n254 Posted 14/02/2023 at 20:41:18\nShithouses. I keep using that word too much lately.\nI've been in many situations where the boys and and girls didn't like or instinctively want to do what I was telling them to do. But I was there with them not absent because I was afraid. I was afraid. For them foremost and because I didn't know if I would be going home again. But I didnt / couldn't shy away and I never would have.\nWe didn't last night and the vast majority of our supporters stayed to the\nbitter end.\nIt is definitely relevant. They have damaged the relationship with their best asset. Right now, like most, I'm focussed on the team, but it doesn't hide the underlying issue.\nAn escalation of their own making through poor judgement, bad communication and not really understanding this fanbase and what OUR club means to us.\n255 Posted 14/02/2023 at 20:43:20\nYou quite reasonably ask me where the goals are going to come from.\nWe all know we don't have a consistent, fit goal scorer just now. I think we might get away with small contributions from various players (we have enough big men in the box) as they feed on scraps at corners and set pieces, with the occasional worldie from Gray, and hopefully some from DCL if we can get him fit.\nYou're correct, the usual mindless optimism from me.\nOh for a Gary Lineker. I remember Nev saying years ago that Lineker would stroll in on Monday, do light training on Tuesday, complain about his toe on Wednesday, do a little more light training on Thursday, rest on Friday, and score three on Saturday.\n256 Posted 14/02/2023 at 21:03:11\nI would.\nYes we were poor last night, no arguments there, but 2-0 albeit a loss, playing like we did is not a drubbing, so come on, chins up Leeds at home, that's an important fixture in respect of our future, so get behind the lads, and who knows where we'll end up!\nRelegated? No\n257 Posted 14/02/2023 at 21:06:28\nLampard then spunked the Richarlison money on McNeil, Maupay and Onana. You can't blame the Board for that.\nLampard should have been forced out after Bournemouth. It will bite us on the arse for the fans getting sidetracked by headlock nonsense.\n258 Posted 14/02/2023 at 21:06:59\nJust as we were not saved after the Arsenal game; neither are we doomed after almost inevitably losing to a much, much better side away yesterday.\n259 Posted 14/02/2023 at 21:13:17\n“Lose tonight and beat Leeds, we're out of the bottom threeâ€\n“Win tonight and lose to Leeds, we're still in the bottom threeâ€\nI know it's all hypothetical at the moment, because we've still got to beat Leeds, but I know which one most of us would welcome, hopefully, come 5pm on Saturday evening.\nOf course, win both would have been better, but that was not to be.\n260 Posted 14/02/2023 at 21:19:04\nAnd Robert!\n261 Posted 14/02/2023 at 21:20:05\nYou're completely wrong about Lampard spending the Richarlison money. The first player he tried to buy was Cornet from Burnley, £17.5m, cash upfront. He wasn't given the money, even though we got £50m+ for Richi, went to West Ham instead because they paid all the money, Frank hadn't the final say, Lampard had to wheel and deal, try and buy players over 3/4 year instalments, that's how he ended up getting Maupay.\n262 Posted 14/02/2023 at 21:29:23\nAs if Lampard and Thelwell thought Maupay was really the player we needed. Lampard was obviously not a great manager but he isn't thick.\nIt's obviously boiled down to the fact that we have no money so the payment terms / wage package etc massively limited our realistic options.\nBroja on loan was the one they wanted and maybe there weren't a lot of realistic options beyond that.\n263 Posted 14/02/2023 at 21:30:25\nThe way I see it, if we win our last six games we are safe. Before that we've got 10 extra bites of the cherry. What's there to fear?\n264 Posted 14/02/2023 at 21:33:15\nIan, we'll just have to politely disagree.You obviously focus on managers. I'm more concerned with how the club has been run since failing to build on what we had achieved by 1987.\nIt starts from the top. Our top level is dysfunctional, which in my opinion is why so many deverse and different managers have failed at Everton.\n265 Posted 14/02/2023 at 21:34:57\nThat's tactical thinking, not strategic or having a plan or vision.\nLiving week by week and hoping for the best.\nKlopp took 3 years to turn that ship around Ferguson several at United. But they had long term plans and were backed by competent boards and owners.\nAnd look what they achieved.\n266 Posted 14/02/2023 at 21:58:30\n267 Posted 14/02/2023 at 22:00:17\nHis place in the Brazil side - which seems really important to him - is in jeopardy.\nIf we survive - and we still have the Gordon (&Arteta) money - maybe he could be tempted back?\nI know - it's the hope that kills you.\n268 Posted 14/02/2023 at 22:08:07\nI'm optimistic.\n269 Posted 14/02/2023 at 22:17:20\nUnder Lampard we were one of the three worst teams in the league.\nThe jury's out under Sean but I'm hopeful\nChrist hopeful that we're not one of the worst three teams? NSNO eh?\n270 Posted 14/02/2023 at 22:20:19\nThe headlock is irrelevant? Only an absolute fucking idiot could say something so stupid Ian. Seriously mate, sometimes you should actually think about it, even just a little bit.\n271 Posted 14/02/2023 at 22:20:35\n272 Posted 14/02/2023 at 22:25:39\n273 Posted 14/02/2023 at 22:43:36\nI'm with your optimism.\nWhen are you next at Goodison?\n274 Posted 14/02/2023 at 22:45:36\nRemember over a quarter of the sides in the league haven't won tons of games, four sides including ourselves have secured maximum points on four occasions, West Ham have won five, whilst Forest and Wolves have won six.\nA few back-to-back victories at any point from here on in, will have a huge significance to how the table looks, we all hope that we can do it in the next couple of fixtures and then again a couple more times.\nAt the moment it looks as if Forest, Wolves and Leicester are all safe from danger, but who really knows if it will look that way in a month's time?\nOur problem and we're all fully aware of it, is the same as it's been all season, can we score the goals that secure the points? If we can't, all the other teams' results won't matter as we won't garner enough points to stay up.\n275 Posted 14/02/2023 at 23:01:44\n276 Posted 14/02/2023 at 23:16:16\n277 Posted 14/02/2023 at 23:19:51\nDanny (252) I do genuinely believe we have a realistic hope of survival. We will most certainly need some good fortune along the way but if we can drag ourselves out of the bottom three this weekend I think it will build confidence among our players and fans that we can put a run of positive results together.\n278 Posted 14/02/2023 at 23:40:07\nPickford (c)\nGodfrey, Mina, Tarkowski, Mykolen\nIwobi, Garner, Onana,\nGray, Simms, McNeill\n279 Posted 15/02/2023 at 01:47:41\nJ.H Christ\nTommy Wright (78) - Ratcliffe (for pace) - Watson (for commitment) - Van den Hauwe (for lethalness)\nReid - Ball - Parkinson\nSteven - Dean - Sheedy.\nSurely a new manager can find current players at least their equal?\n...............Then enter the owner/chairman! .\n280 Posted 15/02/2023 at 08:15:45\nPlay mostly Route 1 and surprise the fuck out of them?\n281 Posted 15/02/2023 at 08:36:39\nPsycho Pat for his sheer aggression and intimidation. The tackle at Villa Park in the semi final that made Phil Neville's look tame.\nBlatantly flooring Speedie at Goodison and walking away as if nothing happened and getting away with it. The Scottish player didn't go near him again.\nSheedy to score the winner after having to retake the free kick.\nSorry, I had to!!\n282 Posted 15/02/2023 at 09:11:39\nHe tried to replace the defence and midfield with leaders in Coady, Tarkowski and Gana which the squad was seriously lacking in in his opinion.\nThe players he actually wanted in were Mudryk, Gibbs-White, Kudus and Broja. Who we spent all summer probably trying to sort deals on installments, not willing to pay 㿔M for GW and Mudryk and hanging around to see if Chelsea found a new striker so they would let Broja leave. None of those deals worked out leaving us 5 games into the season without a striker and having to beg Mauypay to choose us over Fulham.\nI'm not sticking up for Frank here becuase he let himself down with his tactics but something tells me if we had MGW, Mudryk and Broja up front he would still be in a job. It's unfair to say Frank blew his budget, I don't think he had a choice to spend it on who he did, whether it down to FFP or the board.\nA more strategic view owuld have been ot have sold Gordon and DCL knowing his injury issues in the summer to have been able to spend, instead of holding on to players who clearly didn't want to stay in the first place.\n283 Posted 15/02/2023 at 10:03:58\nThe fact is that we allowed Koeman and Silva to spend as much as they did meant that we were then getting close to the financial limits set by the Premier League, but undeterred this owner and board carried on letting subsequent managers carry on spending. So when we eventually hired the best manager by a country mile that Moshiri employed, Ancelotti brought in 2 players James on a free and Allan. the club also bought Godfrey and Doucoure after Ancelotti signed but he didnt sign them so you have to ask who did. I suspect as well as the burglary to his home and when he found there was nothing in the kitty he walked. I see Ian Edwards in his post called him the Italian dinosaur maybe you should remember his stats show him to be our third best manager just behind Kendal and Catterick, and unlike them didnt have a massive war chest to achieve that.\nThose saying Frank didnt have money to spend well he spent a lot more than Benitez or Ancelotti our 2 previous managers. He and Thelwell are responsible for Dyche having so few attacking options. He and Thelwell knew what their budget was and decided to spend the money on Onana, Gana, McNeil, Maupay, Delle, Garner, Coady, Tarkowski, Vinagre.\n284 Posted 15/02/2023 at 10:10:47\nYour post is probably the most accurate description of the Summer Transfer window and Frank's ideas on midfielf.Frank finding that like most of his predecessors that he was constrained by the Club Management involved in transfers and interference at the highest level.Moshiri in his pullover interview described the requisition system.Potential transfer where sourced by the Director of Football, and others, in consultation with the Manager.Those decided on as fit for purpose are put on a requisition form, which is sent to the Chairman.As for Gordon's transfer they mismanaged it and their was no interest in Calvert Lewin.\n285 Posted 15/02/2023 at 11:03:31\nApart from not going anywhere near the biggest creep and sneak in the Premiers League, Robertson, during the melee, Van Dijk, another creep, just shoved him in the chest, and he just stood there and did nothing.\n286 Posted 15/02/2023 at 11:30:58\nIwobi is dreadful, never makes a tackle and consistently loses the ball. Godfrey has to come into the back 4 or 3. The lack of pace with Coady and Tarkowski was obvious on Monday.\n287 Posted 15/02/2023 at 11:55:47\nWent up to Auckland a few weeks ago to see Elton John, cancelled at last minute, caught in floods, wading to safety as car write offâ€¦ last couple of days a massive cyclone hits the North Island, huge wind and rain, a national emergency called for only the 3rd time in the country's history..\nWatching the storms blow out of my window is fascinatingly scary, but so many have lost everything, 250k homes without power, roads gone, literally, or buried under huge slips and to top it all, the derby... bad week. So, we have had plague, floods, cyclone, earthquake.. a year in the life down under..\nPerspective, dad used to call itâ€¦ bloody Everton.\n288 Posted 15/02/2023 at 12:11:35\nIwobi has contributed 6 assists this season, the same as the rest of the squad combined. So, the answer is to drop him?\nI am beginning to think Everton fans are allergic to goals.\n289 Posted 15/02/2023 at 12:20:51\nI've read that stat a couple of time in recent days, but wasn't Gray's goal at the Etihad from open play and his goal at Bournemouth in the League Cup?\nNot much of a consolation though is it? A dozen games and only two goals scored by the same player, from open play.\n290 Posted 15/02/2023 at 12:23:29\nDanny, they are rebuilding the cathedral but not likely to open for about 5 years yet.\nThe derby took all the stuffing out of me.\n291 Posted 15/02/2023 at 12:42:27\nHe had a better patch early in the season, but has been really poor recently.\n292 Posted 15/02/2023 at 13:08:28\nSheffield United and Derby County hold the dubious distinction of scoring the fewest goals, 20 each, in a Premier League season, in 2020-21 and 2007-08 respectively.\n293 Posted 15/02/2023 at 13:10:41\nHard to digest the two sloppy goals, but overall the pansies in their nappies had no stomach for the fight from minute 1, that was very obvious.\nStarting with eight men plus the children, Iwobi, Mykolenko and NcNeil, who were fucking disasters on the night, must have ha Rabbit's gob laughing his socks off.\nNobody wanted the ball and nobody wanted to take men on. Cowards and imposters in blue shirts. Bounce did not last long!!\n294 Posted 15/02/2023 at 14:48:23\nThe Leeds team has lots of pace and that little feller Gnonto will run rings round new totem poles (that were brought in to replace the old totem poles).\nI also think we need Godfrey in at right-back because Seamus is struggling, not only for pace in the second half of games, but he is going to crack if he has to play all of our games.\nHoping to see Garner, who did score goals for Forest last term, and I hope that Calvert-Lewin is ready (but I fear that he will be on the bench at best).\n295 Posted 15/02/2023 at 15:19:16\nI hope Garner is available, and I'd even be happy if Calvert-Lewin made the bench. Seamus can't be expected to play again, I'd have a back four of Holgate, Mina, Tarkowski and Godfrey.\n296 Posted 15/02/2023 at 15:33:53\n297 Posted 15/02/2023 at 15:34:35\n298 Posted 15/02/2023 at 15:47:30\nAnother 500-mile round trip to my home city in 5 days.\nJust give me something back.\n299 Posted 15/02/2023 at 15:56:49\nShow up, Everton, because we do every week.\nWe live and breathe you. Try doing the same.\n300 Posted 15/02/2023 at 16:18:42\nUnless it is sorted out soon, then our beloved club will simply never win anything ever again â€“ after all, Cup finals ain't played at Goodison!\nAs for the derby... we simply shit ourselves yet again with a full house at Mordor and on hearing that fucking dirge playing before kick-off (from a musical!), our players failed to show up yet again!\nTruly pathetic... we truly need some sort of spark, a new face, a player that will ignite us,i nspire us... is Isco still available? I'd take him now!\n301 Posted 15/02/2023 at 18:07:52\nYou'll Never Walk Alone is our song! — Manchester Evening News\n302 Posted 15/02/2023 at 18:12:31\n303 Posted 16/02/2023 at 14:47:01\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
