  "body_text": "Manchester United defender Diogo Dalot has provided a very optimistic fitness update, strongly hinting that he could play a part in the upcoming Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur.\nUnited’s dominant 7-1 aggregate win over Athletic Bilbao secured their place in the final two, with a Champions League spot on the line for the winner.\nDalot has been sidelined since last month with a calf injury, which he picked up in the 1-0 defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Earlier on Wednesday, Ruben Amorim expressed doubts about the possibility of the full-back being available for selection against Tottenham.\nHowever, Dalot has struck a more positive tone, giving supporters hope that he could make a timely return.\nHe spoke to the media and revealed, “I’m feeling good. So, feeling better every day. At this stage, we go day by day to see how it goes but so far so good.”\nAsked how hopeful he is of being fit enough for the Europa League final, he answered, “I’m working really hard. You can imagine how much I want to be back – as soon as possible. So I’m really pushing myself to be available as soon as possible but we will see.”\nTottenham have already beaten United three times this season. When this was put to Dalot, the defender insisted that their past record doesn’t matter as the final is a one-off game, where anything could happen.\n“When you get to a final in a competition like this, what you have done previously will not be important to the result. Two English teams are playing and it will be a very good game to watch I think. We are two big clubs so the aim is to be in the best position mentally and physically to win it and I think that’s the goal that we need to have.”\nAfter last Sunday’s defeat to West Ham, Amorim told the press that United are losing the feeling of being a big club.\nAsked whether this is something he relates to, Dalot remarked, “Obviously it hurts, it’s something we definitely need to change. Something that has been quite clear in terms of results, we are not being consistent enough and we’re not showing the type of performances that the club should present, especially here at Old Trafford. So it’s something that we definitely need to change. We have a lot of work to do. I’m sure that he believes in us as much as we believe in him.”\n“So altogether, I think we can turn things around and we can start that as soon as possible.”\nOn what a Europa League final triumph would mean, Dalot said, “Winning the Europa League would mean less bad than the season actually is. Everybody knows this is not the standard for the club, nowhere near it.”\n“What we have been doing this season is not what this club deserves, so I think it is the least we could do for the fans because they suffer as much as us. I know how much it wins, European trophies and European nights.”\n“We have one more opportunity to be in the Champions League and to win a major competition, that is where we want to be and if we have that opportunity we need to grab it.”\nOn whether the fact United have already played at San Mames could give them an advantage over Tottenham, Dalot opined, “I mean it can, just because you know the inches of the pitch, but I don’t think it will matter if we play there or not. In the end, it will be obviously what we bring inside the pitch, the energy the fans will bring us. I’m sure it’ll be unbelievable, like they always do and altogether, we can hopefully make a special night again for this club.”\nOn why United play so much better in the Europa League compared to the Premier League, Dalot did not give a specific reason, only acknowledging that he and his teammates need to work on this problem so it doesn’t happen again down the line.\nPressed further on whether Amorum’s tactics just work better in Europe, Dalot stressed that this isn’t the case because even in the Europa League, there have been instances where United haven’t been at their best but they’ve still managed to find a way to win – which is certainly not the case domestically.\nOn whether United’s experience of winning trophies gives them the upper hand over Tottenham, Dalot said, “It won’t give you an advantage. It will give you a perception that what you have done before…it doesn’t necessarily mean that you were going to win or lose the game. We’re talking about one game of football, one bad day for one team, one good day for the other team.”\n“So we just have to work as much as we can, be 100% focused so we can end be happy at the end of the day. And I think that’s where we should focus on. Obviously we’re going to have time to analyse the team, to analyse the type of game that we want to play as well. But in the end, it’s a final. We just have to find a way to win.”\n🚨 NEW YOUTUBE VIDEO 🚨\n'We’ve been suffering for years!
