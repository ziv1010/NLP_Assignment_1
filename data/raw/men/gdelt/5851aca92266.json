He had a mixture of so many different attributes: power, strength and tenacity but, in terms of just natural ability, Joe Cole was the best.\n‘Joe went to Chelsea and it changed his game. He turned into a very much a team player and it wasn’t the same Joe that I remember when he was 17, who just played the game for fun and on pure instinct.\n‘I’m sure he’d probably say the same thing if he looks back on all that he’s achieved – he could have actually been even better than he was.\nMore Trending\n‘[Steven] Gerrard, [Frank] Lampard and [Paul] Scholes were incredible players, don’t get me wrong, but at that age Joe was pure magic.\n‘He was more natural than Stevie G [Steven Gerrard]. Stevie could do everything, but Joe was just a magician of a player. He was definitely different in that respect from most English players that we had at that time.\n‘When he was 16 or 17 years old, Joe was different to everyone. He was different from all the English kids, he played like he was Brazilian.’\nSince retiring in 2018, Cole has become a popular pundit, mainly appearing on TNT Sports.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Nani hails ‘amazing’ £60m star who would have been perfect for Man Utd\nMORE: Liverpool and England legend Steven Gerrard names his best five teammates\nMORE: Why Premier League is breaking Boxing Day tradition with only one football match",
