  "body_text": "So, the Prem will be decided on the final day for the 10th time in the competition’s history.\nArsenal need to beat Everton and hope West Ham get a result at the Etihad.\nMan, City know if they win, they will lift the title for the 4th consecutive year which has never happened before in English Football.\nSpurs need a point to seal 5th. If they lose Chelsea can overtake them.\n5th is the one position that guarantees a place in the Europa League.\nNewcastle can overtake Chelsea in 6th but need to match / better Man United’s result to hang on to 7th.\nWe still don’t know if 6th qualifies you for the Europa League or UEFA Conference. Or if 7th will be good enough to qualify for Europe at all.\nThat all depends on the FA Cup Final.\nIf City win at Wembley, 5th and 6th will be enough for the Europa, 7th grants you a place in the Conference.\nIf United lift the trophy, 6th would only be good enough for the Conference.\nWhile it’s not guaranteed the promoted sides are the same three who are returning to the Championship, it’s improbable that Luton stay up.\nThey would have to beat Fulham, hope Forest lose at Burnley and there be a goal swing of 12.\nArsenal 4-0 Everton\nI’m surprised that the same Gooners who after our win at Old Trafford were confident we would be Champions, are now giving up just because Man City got three points at the Lane.\nWere some that confident Tottenham would do us a favour?\nI always felt it was more likely West Ham would give us a helping hand then Spurs, just due to crazy things happening on the final day.\nNothing has changed since we lost to Villa, we need to keep on winning and hope by law of averages City are due some bad luck.\nI do think there will be a moment in the day where our hopes are raised before our hearts are broken all over again.\nEventually though the Emirates might hear that the home side are winning comfortably at the Etihad and therefore with the pressure off, we should score more goals late on in our game as then we can play with freedom.\nWhatever happens though I hope all Gooners show the class that our Spurs peers lacked this week.\nOne of the youngest squads in the division have shown maturity this year, have put pride back into the badge, produced a skillset that previous version of Gunners haven’t shown for decades.\nAt the very least they deserve a standing ovation\nBrentford 1-1 Newcastle\nNewcastle need to better or match Man United’s result to guarantee 7th place and then need to wait for the FA Cup Final to know if that’s good enough for Europe.\nBournemouth Vs Brentford last weekend was the definition of two teams on the beach playing but the Bees might turn it on for their final game of the season.\nBrighton 3 -1 Man United\nTo be a big club you need to act like a big club. For a club the size of Man United to need favours elsewhere just to have a chance of playing in the UEFA Conference….someone has to say that is unacceptable.\nUnderstandably it seems Ten Hag is saving certain players for the FA Cup Final.\nEven if he beats Man City at Wembley though, I’m not sure that saves his job?\nBurnley 1-1 Notts Forest\nEven if they lose, Forest can only be relegated if there is a 12-goal swing after a Luton win.\nNot that they should celebrate too much.\n29 points is the lowest total it’s taken to stay up In the Premiership. Even if they hadn’t had points taken away, they still would have the record.\nTo put that into perspective West Ham were once relegated with 42 points.\nGiven the money Forest have spent and rules they have broken this shouldn’t be a cause for celebration.\nBurnley to play well without having the quality in the final third, which would sum up their season.\nCrystal Palace 3-1 Aston Villa\nSome of my fellow Gooners have asked this week, if the roles were reversed, would we not be mocking Spurs?\nLet me answer that question by painting you a picture ….\nImagine Arsenal have just lost a game which costs us a place in the Champions League.\nThink of the criticism Arteta would get for a failure to finish in the top 4.\nWould those at the Emirates do the Poznan?\nOr would they be furious?\nWhen Tottenham beat Aston Villa in March their fate was in their own hands.\nTuesday confirmed they had failed in their objective, yet they were celebrating.\nWhere else would that happen?\nThis is a tricky game for Villa and when they lose it might make some of Spurs fans realise what a missed opportunity this was.\nChelsea 3-0 Cherries\nThe way Chelsea have ended this season probably has kept Pochettino in a job.\nThey remind me of the Arteta’s first couple of years saw him put his faith in youngsters therefore accepting inconsistency.\nBy some Gooners mindset though because the Blues failed to qualify for Europe last season, 5th or 6th would now be viewed as progress?\nChelsea fans wouldn’t say that.\nLuton 1-1 Fulham\nMany assumed Luton would struggle like Sheffield United and that they should be proud to have taken their relegation battle to the last day. Yet 29 points is enough to stay up this season, easily the lowest points tally in the history of Prem enough to avoid relegation.\n2 clubs with points deductions have also stayed up.\nThat could be an indication of the gap in quality between the topflight and the Championship.\nWill be interesting to see how the newly promoted sides fare next campaign.\nRob Edwards was so emotional last weekend; I wonder if has the energy to go again with the Hatters or looks for a new challenge?\nLiverpool 3-1 Wolves\nFor a while Liverpool thought this would be a romantic farewell to Jürgen Klopp believing the day would coincide with him lifting his second ever Prem.\nI actually predicted last summer that this would be the manager’s final season at Anfield. You could see the German’s demeanour towards the media was changing and I questioned did he have the energy it takes to take on Pep Guardiola for another year?\nIt highlights the mentality it takes to do what Pep has done for years, almost bordering on obsession to detail.\nThe Kop will give him the sendoff he deserves.\nMan City 4-1 West Ham\nArsenal knew they had to be flawless in the run in due to the Champions ability to put together a winning sequence meaning I gave up on our title dream during the second half against Aston Villa.\nIf you had to bet your life on the outcome of this Sunday, of course you would go for a home win but I’m not sure I agree with this notion that the Gunners now need a miracle.\nThe 9th place team in the table getting a draw at the Etihad is unlikely but not impossible. A team having 90 minutes where they can’t put a ball in the net or a keeper making a mistake is not a miracle.\nLuton need a miracle to stay up, that’s what I call a miracle.\nI have seen a lot stranger results in football.\nIt’s not like we need the Hammers to win 3-0! This is the same club who won at the Emirates.\nMan City have won the Premiership 4 times on the final day but it’s worth remembering three of those times they had to come from behind to win.\nI just sense there will be a moment this weekend where Gooners are allowed to dream before reality resumes.\n12 months ago, some in our fanbase didn’t understand how hard it was to get over the line even when ex-players tried to warn them.\nI think Pep Guardiola is finally getting the credit he deserves for the standards he’s set. Not just do his players for years cope with must win conditions every few days, they do it with a smile on their faces.\nSheffield United 0 -4 Spurs\nSomething tells me that Spurs fans didn’t think they would get the backlash they have received this week.\nWe all get banter but celebrating a loss that costs your team a place in the Champions League?\nAll they have done is frustrate a manager who they clearly rate.\nThat’s three coaches in a roll who with great anger have questioned the ambition and mindset of the club.\nThat’s an embarrassment and not a coincidence.\nBig Ange knows that have a poor start to next season and stopping Arsenal winning the league (because they lost) does not save his job.\nI can’t think of another situation on a day your club fails in its objective.\nFail and do the Poznan?\nFail and sing a song?\nThey better not dare ever ask for a manager to be sacked based on league position because this week tells us that as long as Arsenal don’t win the League, they have had a great season.\nYour love for your club should be above your dislike for others.\nIf you don’t want others to know your predictions, ask admin for my email.\nDrayton 272\nBaron 270\nPrince 269\nGunsmoke 260\nTerrah 255\nJRA 254\nAckshay 252\nMatthew 249\nTom 249\nStephanie 248\nSid 245\nGB 242\nDendrite 239\nSue P 238\nJ gunner 237\nMe 236\nAntivirus 235\nGoonersia 232\nSagie 229\nOkobino 228\nNOAS 228\nMTG 225\nIGL 222\nEdu 220\nTop 24 Qualify for Euros\nWilliamrick 216\nI Achiel 212\nIG 209\nBig slim 207\nJ legend 203\nKenya 001- 204\nBig slim 199\nI 192\nYayo 191\nSplendid 190\nJ gunz 182\nTaiwo 4321- 175\nZeek 174\nAyan 167\nSamson A 147\nOluseyi 20- 138\nOladmeji A 135\nBang bang 130\nGundown 124\nVZ 118\nFanuel priston 115\nWalidomy 112\nDiehard 109\nAdeski 108\nQB 105\nOnyango 99\nToney 99\nPrince layote 94\nAngelo 91\nFamochi 91\nAdmin 83\nJ Bauer 75\nDotash 74\nDan kit 73\nRalph 70\nJ Bauer 69\nAmir 67\nAyodale A 64\nE blaze 51\nElvis 51\nDavars 49\nAkeno Bonniface 43\nJen 40\nJimmy B 37\nKobin 37\nUzi Ozil 34\nSWS 31\nLongbenark 26\nUzi Ozil 23\nIlliterate 23\nJimeigo T 17\nChuck 16\nM leashim 16\nPeter 15\nKoktafo 14\nGunner 4 lyfe 14\nWale A 14\nFreddy 14\nLoose cannon 13\nOslogunner 11\nFlash G 11\nCaxbury Dan 11\nShola 10\nKb Rano 10\nGunner 10\nEmperor A 10\nGerald king 9\nVembu 7\nSamchidy 8\nGio Bag 7\nEvansibility 7\nMading East 7\nOlaraj propertie / partners 5",
