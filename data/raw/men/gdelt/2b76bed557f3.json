  "body_text": "Liverpool boss Arne Slot called his players into the training ground on Sunday morning which tells of the crisis within the club as they slip even further down the table in 12th place.\nI travelled up to Anfield last weekend and quite frankly the Reds were not worth the train fare. They blew around the pitch like an empty crisp packet with no direction on a windy day and Forest took full advantage to come out as astounding 3-0 winners. The weather was horrible, I saw snow and Liverpool reminded me of the Christmas carol, “In the Bleak Midwinter” because unless the coach takes grip of the situation, the next few months are going to be very difficult.\nThe Reds are now in a severe crisis after their worst start to a season in 72 years and losing nine of their last 12 games. Coach Arne Slot seems incapable of explaining why everything is going wrong but admits his captain Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate, Mo Salah and Milos Kerkez are not performing for the club, making mistakes and are being embarrassed by opponents. It is time for drastic changes at Anfield.\nBehind the scenes at Crystal Palace the club are expecting a Liverpool bid in January for club captain Marc Guehi. I understand they believe no other club will be involved although the centre-back has been discussed at Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona. Guehi currently earns £50k a week ((£2.6m per year) and if the Liverpool transfer goes through, he can expect to double that figure.\nBecause his contract expires next summer, selling in January is the only way Palace can make any money out of the deal and they realise that trying to influence him to stay at Selhurst Park won’t work. He is free to speak with foreign clubs in January and he can sign a pre-contract before the end of this season.\nLiverpool recognise they have to bolster their defence after a disastrous time defending their title and Guehi is their top priority.\nTottenham owners stick with Frank\nFollowing Tottenham’s humiliating defeat to Arsenal the owners have sent a message of reassurance to Thomas Frank and the supporters. The Lewis family’s interests are now run by billionaire Joe’s son and daughter and they have explained that £10million was paid to Brentford to secure Frank’s services at the London Stadium. It is, they say, part of a long term plan to put Tottenham up there with the elite and fighting for titles and that takes time. They are sticking to the plan and not panicking or rushing into any quick sticking plaster decisions.\nTalking to forums and supporters’ groups, there is a definite feeling that the Tottenham job is too big for the Danish coach. They say they do not want to be compared to Brentford but Frank is reducing the club down to their level instead of building on the strengths of the players he has now and not chopping and changing the team based on which opponents they are facing.\nMainoo and Zirkzee on way out of Old Trafford\nFrom a career which was travelling at stellar speed to making an abrupt stop, Kobbie Mainoo finds himself, at 20-years-of-age, a mere passenger at Old Trafford. Both he and 24-year-old Joshua Zirkzee are not considered good enough to regularly start for Manchester United’s first team although Zirkzee did start against Everton on Monday evening and Mainoo came off the bench. Neither player had much success during the match. Both players and their agents are exploring options for a move to another club but they have been given a stay of execution due to player availability Ruben Amorim’s squad will be serious depleted next month with the Africa Cup of Nations and Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui will report for duty with Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Morocco respectively. The tournament runs from December 23rd until January 18th. Mainoo and Zirkzee, who are both pushing for a transfer, have been told they will not be allowed to leave until after AFCON.\nHope for Cole Palmer making swift recovery\nWhen I checked at Chelsea’s Cobham training centre on Wednesday morning, Cole Palmer had been going through a carefully medically prepared light routine despite breaking his little toe less than a week ago. Boss Enzo Maresca, fresh from Chelsea’s Champions League (win/loss/draw) on Tuesday evening, said he would be surprised if Cole was fit to face Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday but he said there was a small chance it could happen.\n23-year-old Cole was wearing a specially made left boot which I am told is aiding his recovery after stubbing his toe on a door at home. Maresca said, “I spoke to Cole…and it was a good feeling.” Fingers crossed for the Blue’s fans.\nVan Dijk’s Liverpool verdict..“Totally unacceptable”\nVirgil van Dijk hit the nail on the head when describing Liverpool’s season so far as a “mess” and “totally unacceptable.” A typical example was Mo Salah rolling a ball across the centre of the penalty area which last season would have seen the net nearly burst with a shot from one of the forwards. That didn’t happen because there was no one on duty to take that opportunity. Where was the £125million Alexander Isak who was banging in goals thick and fast before his acrimonious transfer but seems to be on an early holiday this year? He has played only 497 minutes so far this season resulting in one single goal and that was against Southampton in the Carabao Cup..hardly worth remembering.\nOpponents have worked out how to play Liverpool…for instance they are being prevented from winning the ball in the final third of the pitch as they attempt to attack.\nChelsea vs Arsenal\nThe top two clash this weekend with both clubs riding high in the Premier League and the Champions League. Both were very successful in the Champions League this week.\nChelsea are fresh from humbling Barcelona on Tuesday evening with Estevao and Liam Delap both hitting the net. Barca’s defence was poor but against Arsenal they came up against arguably the best defensive line in the league. Hincapie has stepped up to replace the injured Gabriel Magalhaes alongside Jurrien Timber, William Saliba and Riccardo Calafiori.\nThis match has all the ingredients of a classic encounter with personal battles all around the pitch. Chelsea left back Marc Cucurella has to be one of the best wing-backs in the league and it will be his job to shackle and contain Bukayo Saka. Both are on form and capable of splitting any defence as Cucurella displayed for the Blue’s first goal against Barcelona. Arsenal’s Eberechi Eze’s splendid hat-trick against Tottenham last weekend was an example of what he is capable of and with Zubimendi, Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard punching balls through to Mikel Merino the Chelsea defence of William Fofana and Trevoh Chalobah are going to have to be on top of their game to contain them. Leandro Trossard poses a threat down the left and Manuel Gusto will match up against him but Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has coached the Belgian winger to come inside more and even go for goal and he could easily skip past the Chelsea right back.\nPedro Neto showed his speed and direct play against Barca but again this time he meets some of the best defenders in world football. Put all the above into a package and this could be one of the classic match ups of the season with both managers anxious to win with Arsenal leading Chelsea by 6 points in the table.\nUPDATE NEWS:\nNigerians can now invest ₦2.5 million on premium domains and profit about ₦17-₦25 million.
