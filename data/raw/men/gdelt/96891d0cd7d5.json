Everyone pats you on the shoulder and tells you how nice the football looks,\" said Hofmann.\nHofmann toasted his team's \"extreme potential\" after Leverkusen's best start to a league season in their history, but said \"it's important to stay humble.\"\nUnion Berlin's poor start to the season continued, losing 1-0 away at promoted Heidenheim after a second-half goal from Jan-Niklas Beste.\nBeste's free-kick deflected into the net midway through the second half, consigning Champions League participants Union to their fifth consecutive defeat in all competitions for the first time since 2004.\n\"There are going to be phases like this. It's up to us to get out of it,\" said Union captain Christopher Trimmel.\nSurprise package Stuttgart continued their remarkable rise this season, winning 2-0 at Cologne thanks to a brace from Deniz Undav.\nStuttgart, who needed to win a relegation playoff against Hamburg last season to stay up, sit second having won five of six matches.\nWolfsburg striker Jonas Wind scored both goals to help his team to a 2-0 home win over Eintracht Frankfurt and now has seven of his team's nine league goals this season.\nElsewhere, a double from Alassane Plea earned Gladbach their first win of the season, a 3-1 victory away at Bochum.\nFlorian Neuhaus opened the scoring for the visitors and Plea added two by half-time, before Bochum's Anthony Losilla pulled one back.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
