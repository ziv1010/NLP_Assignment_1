But when asked about his plans in Friday's press conference ahead of Saturday's game at home to Las Palmas, Xavi said he was not changing his mind.\n\"Both my training staff and I are very grateful for the president's words and there is a lot of confidence in the relationship with Laporte and (Sporting Director) Deco and we are also friends, but I don't think anything will change. I am thinking of the best for the club and I will always be grateful,\" he replied. Enditem\nNo comments.",
