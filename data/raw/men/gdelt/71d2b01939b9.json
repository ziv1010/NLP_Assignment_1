The feeling was really good, and as of tonight, Carrick is becoming the leading option for the interim job.”\nIn a follow-up post on X, he added: ‘Michael Carrick had positive contact with INEOS and Man United management, advancing to become the new interim manager. Man Utd will announce a new coach this week and Carrick is hopeful to get the job.\n‘Solskjaer, waiting for club’s decision.’\nWant breaking transfer lines from original sources?

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer originally viewed as frontrunner, but Carrick gave a strong interview this week. Decision between pair expected on Monday.’\nAnd Jones added: ‘Michael Carrick has become the favourite to be interim Man Utd boss. Would be a good opportunity for him, he understands the club well, and he is also on an upward curve in his own career.’\nSpeaking in the aftermath of Sunday’s FA Cup exit to the Seagulls, caretaker boss Fletcher said he had been given no signs on who the club would opt for.\n“I’ve had no discussions,” he said. “I have to report tomorrow [Monday] morning to Carrington, that is all I know.\n“I will find out tomorrow morning. I have had zero indications. All my focus has been on Burnley and Brighton.\n“It is a massive responsibility to lead this club, and I have given it my best, and I am disappointed not to win a game.\n“I think there are some good things there, but ultimately it wasn’t enough. I am more disappointed than anyone.”\nRegardless of who the club decide on, Fletcher has urged the United squad not to waste the season and focus on the matter at hand.\n“Any time you come in at Manchester United, it’s a massive job. The thing for me is there’s still a lot to play for this season.\n“And if I look at the players and we get players back from injury and AFCON and we get a fuller squad, I think these players have got the ability to qualify in the Champions League places.\n“And that should be their objective, that should be their mindset.\n“But they’re going to have to come together and be part of that as well.\n“It’s not about a manager. It’s not about directors. It’s about everyone, and the players have to group together, take responsibility, find a way of improving quickly and take on the challenge for the rest of the season.\n“Don’t waste the season.\n“It’s not Manchester United level or what’s expected from Manchester United. But ultimately, we have to do something.\n“And that’s still not success, but take a step forward by qualifying for the Champions League.”\nLatest Man Utd news: Bruno Fernandes finished; £100m signing move\nElsewhere on the new manager front, United have been warned that any potential new boss will likely be put off by the way the club has been run since Sir Jim Ratcliffe took charge and with Alan Shearer naming SEVEN major failings since the British billionaire bought a £1.3bn stake in the club.\nMeanwhile, teammates of Bruno Fernandes believe the playmaker will leave Old Trafford in the summer, and a report has outlined the frustrating reasons why and amid claims the player has ‘had enough’ of their ongoing struggles.\nFinally, Romano has confirmed that he expects United to be “serious contenders at the table” to sign an elite midfield talent in 2026, as they look to revamp their engine room, and despite the international star’s whopping £100m (€115m, $134m) valuation.",
