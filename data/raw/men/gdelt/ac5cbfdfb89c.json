  "body_text": "By Eddie Howe’s admission, this was “a key moment” in Newcastle United’s season.\nFail to win again and the negative momentum that had been building since 2023 began threatened to derail a campaign that had promised so much before New Year. But claim a first Premier League victory in six attempts since January 15 and the dream of Champions League qualification would remain within Newcastle’s hands.\nAdvertisement\n“Desperate to win”, head coach Howe decided it was time to make radical changes to his starting XI — five in total — and completely reshape an attack that had delivered only three goals in eight league games. It was the moment to “rotate and freshen up” a unit that had gone stale.\nThe proactive selections for the visit of Wolves were bold and risky — Miguel Almiron, previously an ever-present, was dropped to help make way for three players who had managed just 17 top-flight starts between them before Sunday’s match — yet the calculated gamble succeeded.\nThe newcomers reinvigorated a side who have been renowned for their high-intensity, front-foot style, but who have appeared leaden and leggy recently.\nThe trio of Jacob Murphy, Allan Saint-Maximin and, in particular, Alexander Isak, were everything Almiron and especially Callum Wilson have not been for weeks. They were dynamic, they were powerful and they were extremely direct. Along with Joe Willock, restored to the XI for the first time in three games following injury, Newcastle were athletically superior in every facet.\nAt times, the front three terrorised a Wolves side who looked technically proficient, if lightweight in comparison. The high press, the overlaps and underlaps, and the constant set-piece threat Newcastle provided was a welcome reminder of what this side have been for much of Howe’s 16 months in charge.\nAs Isak put it, Newcastle “created a lot of danger”.\nThe starting XI also offered a glimpse into a potentially exciting future. For the first time in the Premier League, Bruno Guimaraes, Sven Botman and Isak started together, with the latter delivering a coming-of-age performance.\nIt was the sort of man-of-the-match display that will lead many fans to wonder whether the Sweden international has now leapfrogged Wilson to become the club’s first-choice centre-forward.\nAdvertisement\nIsak has the best goals-to-minute ratio of any Newcastle player this season. He has scored four times, from a non-penalty expected goals (xG) return of 3.32, and is averaging 0.56 goals per 90.\nIt was Isak who led the press, harrying Wolves’ back four and goalkeeper; it was Isak who galloped down the channels, embarrassing Craig Dawson with his speed and clever running lines; it was Isak who repeatedly gestured to the crowd to raise the noise levels; it was Isak who opened the scoring, with what Howe lauded as “the finish of a traditional Newcastle No 9”.\nAlexander Isak scores Newcastle United's first goal in four matches ⚽️\nHis fine header gives #NUFC the lead over #WWFC #NEWWOL\n🎥 @SkySportsPL pic.twitter.com/bsPn1AxaIp\n— The Athletic | Football (@TheAthleticFC) March 12, 2023\nNewcastle did not sign the 6ft 3in (192cm) Isak from Spain’s Real Sociedad last summer for his aerial ability. In fact, they identified that as an area where their £60million ($72.2m) record signing needed to greatly improve.\nAlready, progress has been made on the training ground. Those inside the club have raved about Isak’s performances during training sessions and lamented the thigh injuries and concussion that had restricted the 23-year-old to just five league starts for Newcastle before Sunday.\n“Everyone wants to play and it’s the same for me,” Isak says. “It depends on how you take it and what you do with it. I’ve worked hard and taken it as a bit of fuel and tried to be ready.”\nThroughout his 68 minutes on the pitch, Isak was breathless, showing a sharpness and threat that Wilson has simply been unable to match recently. Howe asked Isak “to run himself into the ground until you can no longer run” and the forward “emptied” himself before being withdrawn for the final quarter.\nDuring the build-up, Howe had suggested Isak was not ready to complete a full match. “He’s fit to play 90 minutes for another team,” Howe said. “I need to clear this up: it’s about being fit enough to play 90 minutes how I want him to play and what I demand from my players.”\nAdvertisement\nWhen Isak leapt highest to expertly direct a Kieran Trippier free kick into the left corner of the net in the 26th minute, it was the crowning point of a match-defining performance. One that did not hint at physical issues.\nThat’s a great header Isaaakkkk 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 #NEWWOL\n— Alan Shearer (@alanshearer) March 12, 2023\n“I can get fitter, but I feel fit and I feel good when I’m out there,” Isak says. “I enjoyed being back on the scoresheet here in front of our fans. It’s a great feeling.”\nBut Isak was aided by the invention and intent of his fellow forwards.\nSaint-Maximin splits opinion, but the Frenchman’s ingenuity brings an additional dimension — particularly with the St James’ crowd behind him.\nMurphy, meanwhile, was a questionable selection, but his recent cameos warranted a start. Howe values his endeavour — few players pressurise the opposition as well when out of possession — and it was the 28-year-old who assumed Almiron’s role as off-the-ball agitator-in-chief.\nEnd-product and quality may be lacking, but there is a reason Murphy, like Almiron, has appeared in every league match this season, albeit this was only his sixth start.\nContent with his status as a dependable but rarely celebrated squad member, Murphy’s response when asked to be interviewed after the game was: “Can I just fly under the radar this week?”\nWhether this front three can replicate this performance and deliver a similar physical output with only a five-day turnaround for the trip to Nottingham Forest on Friday night is questionable.\nCrucially, though, Howe now has options.\nAlmiron responded to being dropped by combining brilliantly with Willock for Newcastle’s decisive second, the fourth time he has provided the winning goal this season. Wolves defender Max Kilman may have deflected the shot, but the Paraguayan’s desire and directness after coming on in the 68th minute were reminiscent of his electric early-campaign form.\nWe've missed these! 😍\nHOWAY THE LADS! ⚫️⚪️ pic.twitter.com/8wYmrsROJa\n— Newcastle United FC (@NUFC) March 12, 2023\nWilson, too, will be stronger if he can manage a week of undisrupted training, after illness again restricted his involvement. Once Anthony Gordon returns from his ankle injury, Howe should have positive selection dilemmas across the forward line.\nAdvertisement\nFrom a team who had failed to score twice since Boxing Day, suddenly Newcastle look like they can really push for a top-four finish once more.\nAs Howe admitted, Newcastle “needed something to reignite” their campaign.\nThis victory, and the transformed front three, might do just that.\n(Top photo: Naomi Baker/Getty Images)",
