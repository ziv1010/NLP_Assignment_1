  "body_text": "Real Madrid had just come back from two goals down to beat Liverpool 5-2 in the Champions League last-16 first leg. In the post-match press conference at Anfield, head coach Carlo Ancelotti reserved his strongest praise for the player who had scored two goals and provided an assist on the night: Vinicius Junior.\nAdvertisement\n“Today, he is the most decisive player in world football,” Ancelotti said. “There is no other player with that kind of consistency.”\nVinicius Jr was named man of the match for his fine display, but Ancelotti’s words were the strongest endorsement possible after the 22-year-old Brazil winger was left off the 26-man shortlist for the 2022 FIFPro World XI — voted for by the global union for professional players. That omission came as a huge surprise to Madridistas and prompted Ancelotti to say Vinicius Jr’s fellow players must have “made a mistake”.\nIt is hard to argue with Ancelotti given how influential Vinicius Jr has been for Madrid this season. He has scored 18 goals and provided nine assists across all competitions — making him Real’s joint-top scorer with Karim Benzema and their most effective provider. Statistics from Opta show he has been one of the outstanding forwards across Europe’s top five leagues, with several aspects in which he is the undisputed best.\nGO DEEPER\nThe rise of Vinicius Junior and how Ancelotti brought his Real career to life\nOne of those is his dribbling. Vinicius Jr has completed 67 dribbles in La Liga this season, more than anyone else in all of Europe’s top five leagues. It is three more than Paris Saint-Germain’s Lionel Messi in Ligue 1.\nHe has won 84 fouls in Spain, nearly 20 more than the next-most targeted players in the top European leagues — Montpellier’s Teji Savanier and PSG forward Neymar are joint-second and they have both been fouled 65 times. Some of those challenges on the Real Madrid player have been more brutal than others.\nVinicius Jr has a strong claim, then, to being the most threatening winger in Europe’s top five leagues. In La Liga, no player has produced more carries ending in a chance created (22) or a shot (30), as illustrated in the graphic below. The former is the joint-highest figure in Europe’s top five leagues with Sassuolo’s Armand Lauriente, while the latter is only bettered by AC Milan’s Rafael Leao, who has recorded 34 carries ending in shots.\nOnly two players have enjoyed more than Vinicius Jr’s 166 touches in the opposition box: PSG’s Kylian Mbappe (202) and Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah (182). But the Brazilian’s 11 goal involvements in La Liga are only the joint-eighth most in Spain, with Barcelona’s Robert Lewandowski having scored or assisted the most goals (20).\nEven so, Vinicius Jr has proved himself as Real’s main man this season. He is the Madrid player who has been involved in the most goals in all competitions with 27 contributions, ahead of Benzema with 23 contributions. He and Benzema have the joint-highest share of Madrid’s expected goals (xG) this season (8.1), as seen in the graphic below.\nThe forward’s xG has stayed largely consistent since he arrived at Madrid in the 2018-19 season, but it is only in the past two seasons that he has started to match and surpass those expected figures. He played a crucial role in Real’s La Liga-Champions League double last campaign, scoring 22 goals and providing 20 assists in all competitions.\n“What Vini shows on the pitch is what he does in training,” Ancelotti said recently. “He has improved his finishing a lot because he has worked on it a lot. After training, he stays to finish.”\nAdvertisement\nVinicius Jr has had to work for his starring role. It was not so long ago Benzema was caught on camera urging fellow Frenchman Ferland Mendy not to pass to the Brazilian at half-time of a Champions League match against Borussia Monchengladbach in October 2020. “He plays against us,” Benzema said, in a clear reference to Vinicius Jr, then an exciting but erratic young winger.\nMore than two years on, everyone plays for Vinicius Jr. Madrid concentrate 44 per cent of their attacks down the left wing in La Liga, compared to just 30 per cent down the right.\nThat is a result of Ancelotti having total faith in Vinicius Jr. During Zinedine Zidane’s second spell as Madrid boss from 2019-2021, there were nine games in which the Brazilian was moved from his favoured position on the left. That included an ill-fated Champions League semi-final second leg against Chelsea in 2021 when Vinicius Jr played as a right-winger, but Ancelotti has always kept him on his favourite side. “It would be crazy to put Rodrygo and Vinicius in competition,” the Italian has said.\nMadrid’s reliance on their left-hand side is even more pronounced in some games — during the first half against Liverpool, Ancelotti’s team channelled 51.5 per cent of all attacks down that flank. But how sustainable is that approach? What if Vinicius Jr were to be injured?\n“I don’t think we can see more from him,” Ancelotti said. “It’s rare that he gets injured. Here we have to take into account his genetics, which are spectacular. We have to thank his parents. There is also his professionalism, he takes great care of himself.”\nSo Vinicius Jr is doing his part. Remarkably, he has only been injured once in five seasons as a Madrid player. That happened when the forward tore his external cruciate ligament as Real were knocked out of the Champions League round of 16 by Ajax in 2019.\nAdvertisement\nHe has not looked back since then and has missed just two games this season: one because Ancelotti decided to rest him in a Copa del Rey tie against fourth-tier side Cacereno on January 3 and the other in La Liga against Elche on February 15 due to suspension.\nIt is just as well that Vinicius Jr missed those two games given the vital run of matches that has followed for Madrid. In the next five weeks alone they face Barcelona three times: in the Copa del Rey semi-final first and second legs and in a La Liga meeting sandwiched in the middle on March 19. They will also welcome Liverpool to the Santiago Bernabeu on March 15 for the second leg of their Champions League clash.\nAs long as he is fit, Madrid will continue to look to Vinicius Jr.\nAll stats and tables correct before Monday night’s games\n(Top photo: Angel Martinez/Getty Images)",
