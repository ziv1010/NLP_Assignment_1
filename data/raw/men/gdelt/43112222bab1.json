His departure from West Ham, where he is captain, will be a massive blow to the Europa Conference League champions, despite the significant amount of money they will receive for him.\nNow, West Ham might be bracing themselves for the loss of a second academy graduate to Arsenal. News has been spreading in recent days that Ben Johnson is of interest to the Gunners too.\nAccording to The Sun, West Ham are ‘expecting to sell’ Johnson this summer, because he is ‘refusing’ to sign an extension to his contract that is due to run out next year.\nArsenal are in the market for a reinforcement on the right-hand side of their defence this summer. There has been major progress on a deal for Jurrien Timber from Ajax, but he is more of a centre-back.\nBenjamin White has already been having to play out of position at right-back, rather than centre-half, for Arsenal, whose alternative would be to use Takehiro Tomiyasu.\nTomiyasu hasn’t played for Arsenal since March because of knee surgery. Therefore, his club may be searching for alternatives in his position.\nThere have been various claims about Johnson being an option for Arsenal in recent days, starting from The West Ham Way. Now, The Sun – at 22:40 on its transfer blog – has also suggested he could follow Rice from east to north London.\nThe transfer fee Arsenal would have to pay for Johnson is unclear at this stage, but it shouldn’t be too high.\nBen Johnson due for new challenge\nThe 23-year-old only started nine Premier League matches for West Ham in 2022-23. However, he did manage to make 29 appearances across all competitions.\nAble to feature in any defensive role, Johnson’s versatility could make him a useful asset to whichever club takes him next.\nAfter coming through the West Ham academy, he has made a total of 87 appearances for their senior team, scoring twice.\nLike Rice, he would count towards Arsenal’s homegrown quota if he was to join them. Both players would also be in line to get their first taste of Champions League football each.\nInterestingly, recent reports have hinted that a different full-back could move in the opposite direction to Rice and potentially Johnson. It has been claimed that Nuno Tavares is of interest to West Ham after Arsenal allowed him to spend the 2022-23 season on loan at Marseille.\nTavares plays in the opposite full-back position to Johnson, though, so would not be a like-for-like replacement if those moves were to all go through.\nREAD MORE: Arsenal star in dark over future as Arteta remains silent on exit amid interest from multiple clubs",
