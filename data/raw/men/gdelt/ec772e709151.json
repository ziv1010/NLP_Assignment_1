Already being booed by supporters, he took an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia where he is a tourism ambassador, and was fined and suspended by PSG.\nMessi returned from suspension to play his 75th and final match for PSG last weekend in a defeat by Clermont, during which he was jeered once more and could not add to his tally of 32 goals for the club.\nPSG confirmed this week the Argentine, who earned an estimated annual salary of 30 million euros ($32.1 million) after tax at the Qatar-backed club, would be leaving, with the world left on tenterhooks to find out his next, and potentially final, destination.",
