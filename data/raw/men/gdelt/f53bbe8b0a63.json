Mohamed Salah claimed he was thrown under a bus. Florian Wirtz looked like he’d been hit by one. But Liverpool left Italy with the win they badly needed.\nOn the way:\n- Arne Slot’s Inter reprieve\n- World Cup hotel bonanza\n- New Manchester United hotshot\n- Paul Pogba’s camel racing venture\nHow did they pull that off? Salah-less Liverpool ease pressure on Slot\nNo Salah, no problem would be a naive way of defining Liverpool’s win in Milan last night, but victory at Inter — one of the Champions League’s most impenetrable opponents from Italy’s Serie A — was nothing if not timely, for head coach Arne Slot at any rate.\nAdvertisement\nSalah is a problem and will remain a problem while Liverpool figure out how to resolve the spat between their Egyptian star and Slot long term. Salah tweeting the obligatory photo alone in the gym at the training ground yesterday — ostracised from the squad Slot took to northern Italy — showed his minimal remorse (to those, that is, who think Salah has anything to be remorseful for).\nBut where Slot is concerned, a result in Europe placated the portion of observers who, despite Salah speaking his mind, have criticised the Dutchman for his team’s muddled performances in recent weeks. In truth, it was better than just ‘a result in Europe’. It was a win against the 2023 and 2025 Champions League finalists, a club who last lost at home in that competition in September 2022.\nHow Liverpool got there — via an 88th-minute Dominik Szoboszlai penalty, awarded for the lightest of pulls on Florian Wirtz’s shirt — was a bone of contention. The VAR intervened and while the tug is there to see (above), I’d worry for Wirtz’s safety in a gentle breeze.\nSlot won’t care because he knows that in a sport as tribal as football, people pick sides — and unbroken poor form would only persuade the rank and file at Liverpool that Salah’s complaints were valid, if not helpful or diplomatic.\nBalogun to eclipse Pulisic for USMNT?\nThe trick for players in a World Cup cycle is to peak at the right time, like an athlete aiming for the Olympic Games. It’s not that footballers have the luxury of going off the boil in the intervening years, but in international terms, it helps to time it nicely.\nEnter Folarin Balogun, Monaco’s United States international who is enjoying the best season of his career in the Champions League and possibly his finest one in senior football full stop. The striker netted a sitter during Monaco’s 1-0 Champions League win against Galatasaray, taking him to double figures for club and country this season. He has more than half a chance of eclipsing his 2022-23 tally, when his finishing for Reims took him to a career-best 22 goals in all competitions.\nAdvertisement\nThe assumption is that Christian Pulisic will steal the show at next summer’s World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Charlie Davies, the former U.S. international, sees it as the moment when Pulisic can go properly mainstream in his own backyard. But Balogun has star potential too, because across Europe, not many of Mauricio Pochettino’s players are in a better flow — and nor is Milan’s Pulisic outscoring him.\nGreenwood’s claim for a World Cup place\nIn the difficult-to-ignore stakes, a word on Mason Greenwood. We covered him a fortnight ago, when Laurie Whitwell wrote about the former Manchester United forward’s prospects of going to the World Cup with either England or Jamaica. Six months out, there’s no saying if the 24-year-old will be there.\nHe has significant baggage, after all, which is putting off England, but performances like those he’s producing for Marseille would make him an asset at the 2026 finals. Two efforts saw off Belgium’s Union Saint-Gilloise last night and the second, above, was sweetly taken. If Thomas Tuchel is as uninterested as he sounds, a meeting of minds between Greenwood and Jamaica can’t be far away.\n- Two Jules Kounde collectors’ items saw Barcelona through a tough tie against Eintracht Frankfurt (who didn’t storm Barca’s stadium quite like they did in 2022). No such joy for Chelsea, who lost away to Atalanta. An Enzo Maresca half-time tweak didn’t pay off.\nNews Round-Up\n- Lionel Messi — who else? — picked up Major League Soccer’s MVP award for the second year running. He’s the first player to win it back-to-back, and only the second to win it more than once.\n- A telling admission from Pep Guardiola: he says Real Madrid would have fired him last season for results as mixed as Manchester City’s were then. The comments were part of an attempt by him to defend Madrid head coach Xabi Alonso, whose back is against the wall. The two sides meet in the Champions League today.\n- Paris Saint-Germain owner Qatar Sports Investment is buying Belgian second-division side KAS Eupen. They’ll join a multi-club portfolio that also includes Braga from Portugal’s Primeira Liga.\n- Not to be outdone, Paul Pogba has partnered up with the world’s first professional camel-racing team. You’ll think we’re pulling your leg, but no.\n- And former Barca midfielder Andres Iniesta is front and centre at the launch of the rebranded NSN Cycling team, formerly known as Israel-Premier Tech.\n- Tottenham Hotspur relocated an LGBTQ+ flag for last night’s Champions League game against Slavia Prague, a 3-0 win, following a request from the Czech team on “security grounds”. Its original position was by the away section inside Spurs’ stadium.\n- A Liverpool fan has been charged with racially abusing Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo. The incident is alleged to have occurred during a Premier League game at Anfield on the first night of the season.\nGet your wallet out: Why are World Cup hotels so expensive?\nAnyone who hopes or expects to be at the World Cup — Balogun, Greenwood, spectators from every corner of the planet — ought to start booking hotels. And if they haven’t done so already, it could be costly.\nLike the price of match tickets, which are soaring exponentially, the sale of accommodation in North America will be harvest time for anyone with beds to offer. The Athletic has been monitoring prices in Mexico, Canada and the U.S. and, well, you won’t be shocked to hear that we’ve uncovered a little profiteering — oh, sorry, dynamic pricing.\nI get the concept of supply and demand but even so, hotel charges jumping by around 300 per cent on the dates of the opening round of group-stage play is fairly obscene. In one instance in Mexico, a particular hotel will cost $157 (£118) per night in late May — but $3,882 (£2,916) on June 10 and 11, coinciding with Mexico’s opener against South Africa.\nAdvertisement\nInternational tournaments are never cheap to attend and the cost of living isn’t exactly at an all-time low globally. Nonetheless, I don’t imagine the mission statement of the World Cup when it began in 1930 included a vision of intrepid fans burying themselves in piles of debt. As TAFC reflected on Monday, this FIFA party isn’t open to everybody. Quite the opposite.\nAlso in World Cup land:\n- An official complaint has been made to FIFA, alleging “repeated breaches” of the governing body’s commitment to political neutrality. FairSquare, an advocacy group, also wants an investigation into the award of FIFA’s inaugural peace prize to U.S. President Donald Trump at last week’s group draw.\n- We’ve been analysing the importance of the USMNT’s initial World Cup fixture against Paraguay (in Los Angeles on June 12). Long story short: any time the United States’ men lose their opening match, they are eliminated before the knockouts. Any time they avoid defeat, they progress. So starting with a bang is imperative, even if a 48-team competition means it’s going to be easier to stay alive this time than ever before.\n- Alphonso Davies making his comeback after nine months out with an anterior cruciate ligament injury yesterday was great news for Bayern Munich — but equally good news for Canada. He arguably continues to be the most elite name in Jesse Marsch’s squad, and he’s got ample time to get up to full tilt for the co-hosts.\nAround TAFC\n- We thought Erling Haaland versus Harry Kane would be the shootout for Europe’s Golden Boot, but Kylian Mbappe is getting involved too, as the graphic above shows. He and Haaland go head-to-head at the Bernabeu tonight. Whose finishing has been better?\n- He can do 10,000 keepy-uppies in a row (are you kidding me?) and one of his skills videos has attracted 29million views. Meet JJ Gabriel, the 15-year-old who has Manchester United fans talking.\n- Tom Bogert has analysed the best free agency options in MLS. Somebody could use Walker Zimmerman, surely.\n- How did Vancouver FC, a Canadian club who have never won anything (and are not to be confused with the Whitecaps), reach the 2026 CONCACAF Champions Cup? Josh Healey joined the dots.\n- Most clicked in Tuesday’s TAFC: the sale of a minority stake in Wrexham.\nCatch a match\nSelected games (all 3pm/8pm)\nUEFA Champions League (all TNT Sports in the UK): Athletic Club vs Paris Saint-Germain — Paramount+, ViX; Bayer Leverkusen vs Newcastle United — CBS, Paramount+, ViX; Club Brugge vs Arsenal; Real Madrid vs Manchester City — both Paramount+, DAZN.\nUEFA Women’s Champions League: Chelsea vs Roma; Manchester United vs OL Lyonnes — both DAZN/Disney+.\nChampionship: Hull City vs Wrexham — Paramount+/Sky Sports.\nAnd finally…\nOur gift (or GIF) to you this morning: a funny highlight from the 2025 Arab Cup, which is in full swing in Qatar.\nBahrain beat Sudan in Group D last night and the pick of the action was the bizarre incident you’re seeing above: Sudan’s Ammar Taifour (in white) with the most ludicrous across-his-own-box pass, followed by Bahrain’s Ali Madan (in red) volleying wide of the most open goal he’ll ever see. It’s basically the stuff ‘And Finally…’ lives for.",
