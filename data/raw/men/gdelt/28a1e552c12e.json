After that, it’s grown and grown. We have a drink, catch up, talk about football and politics. And, of course, we remember the old times.”\nAdvertisement\nThese days, around 30 to 35 regulars — all in their 60s and 70s — meet up for their weekly dose of nostalgia over several rounds of hot drinks and maybe the occasional pastry.\nThese guys are Forest through and through: the old Trent Enders, the East Standers, the home-and-away hardcore who followed Forest during their glory years and have the stamps in their passports to prove it.\nThe glory years? A younger generation of Forest fans, born into an entirely different era, might argue that is an apt description for what they are experiencing now. Their team is about to venture into European competition for the first time in 30 years, starting with a trip to Seville to play Real Betis in the Europa League. Almost 4,000 Forest fans will be in Spain, creating memories that will last a lifetime.\nAn older generation, however, can also remember the impact of Hurricane Clough blowing into the City Ground, when the master manager took a drifting, unfashionable club from the lower reaches of the old Second Division and turned them into back-to-back winners of what is now the Champions League.\nJukes takes a sip of his coffee and remembers how it all started. “Funnily enough, a lot of people weren’t happy when Clough, who was seen as a Derby County man, arrived,” he says.\n“But then we started winning, didn’t we? One match, we got four. Next game, five. We played Sheffield United next and got six. Then it was Burnley and everyone wanted seven. We had to make do with beating them 5-2 instead. And on it went.”\nIn Nottingham, they are known as the Miracle Men: the team that came from nowhere to become kings of Europe, go 42 games unbeaten, reach three successive League Cup finals, beat Barcelona in the Super Cup, and bloody Liverpool’s noses in the process.\n“When we played Liverpool in the first round, even before we’d even kicked off, their fans were booking hotels in Munich for the final,” says Mick Meehan, another Coffee Club regular, recalling the 1978-79 European Cup. “It was similar in the semi-final against Cologne. When we got to Germany, they were handing out flyers for travel packages to the final.”\nAdvertisement\nMeehan still has the ticket stub from FC Zurich’s visit to Nottingham in the 1967 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. He is old enough, in other words, to remember the years BC (Before Clough). And he still remembers how, after winning promotion to the First Division in 1977, Forest were widely tipped to go straight back down.\n“If I’d told you then that we’d be league champions within a year, then win the European Cup two years in a row, you’d have carted me away in an ambulance.”\nThe old-timers here still remember the UEFA Cup runs (now the Europa League) in the mid-1980s when only a crooked referee, bribed by the Belgian cheats of Anderlecht, may have stopped Clough adding another trophy to his collection.\nNobody has forgotten the 1995-96 adventures either, when Frank Clark’s team reached the UEFA Cup quarter-finals as England’s last representatives in Europe. So many memories: the teargas in Auxerre, the sub-zero temperatures in Lyon, and the joy in Munich of Steve Chettle, raised in Nottingham, scoring at the end of the Olympiastadion where Trevor Francis’ header won the 1979 European Cup final.\nFrancis will always be remembered as the first £1million footballer in history, but it was a more accurate reflection of Forest’s success story that the first team-mate to congratulate him was a former carpet-fitter who had signed for £2,000 from a local amateur side, Long Eaton United.\nGarry Birtles ended up being given a special award from Roy of the Rovers magazine to recognise his rise to the top. And, years later, Birtles summed it all up rather beautifully. “Every time I watch Liverpool, I look for the flags on the Kop. Because there’s a two-year gap in the dates. They go from ’77 and ’78 to ’81. And I always think: ‘That’s us, that gap. We did that.’”\nThe saddest thing, perhaps, is that a common line of conversation at Coffee Club these days involves the difficulties for some of the old faithful to get tickets for the modern-day European excursions.\nAdvertisement\nJohn ‘Shirty’ Shirtcliffe has been attending fixtures since 1962. This season, he says, is a chance for “younger fans to experience what we did… we’ve been driving them mad for years with our stories and now they can have their own fun”.\nNobody, however, could doubt the commitment of the old guard when you consider, for example, the story Dave Shrewsbury tells about scrimping and saving to afford the ‘Forest Rail’ train to Switzerland for a European Cup tie against Grasshoppers Zurich.\n“All we took was a bottle of orange, a bottle of vodka, and four tins of Heinz baked beans,” says Shrewsbury. “I can’t remember if we had a tin-opener, but we must have found a way because we ended up eating the beans — cold, by the way — on the train.”\nHe is known to his mates as ‘Gus’. And it turns out he and his mates drove all the way to Germany for the final. “We broke down on the Autobahn. The gasket had gone. Luckily, I found a bit of old rubber in the layby. We patched it up. And off we went again.”\nIn another era, you might have found the Coffee Club’s regulars downing pints in The Fountain, the King John, and various other long-lost Nottingham hostelries where it was perfectly normal, in the local dialect, to hear people being called “duck”, or even “duckie”, as a term of affection.\nNowadays, they order an espresso or latte, swap books, argue about Ange Postecoglou’s tactics and, with Clough’s statue visible from the Caffe Nero window, willingly accept the days have gone when they returned from European adventures with wild stories of sleeping in the streets or dancing in fountains.\nJukes, recognisable for his red headband and long hair, brought a bag of tomatoes to the latest get-together and a Norman Wisdom DVD in case anyone was a fan of the late comedian and actor. Reg Patterson, another honorary member, organised a team photograph — a weekly ritual — and everyone said happy birthday to Trev Hardy, who had turned 74 and handed out slices of raspberry cake to mark the occasion.\nAdvertisement\nDoes the same happen elsewhere? Is there a place in Amsterdam where fans of the 1970s Ajax sides catch up every week? Is there a Liverpool coffee club? Or a group in Hamburg who meet up to remember their Kevin Keegan era and curse Cloughie’s team for ruining the 1980 European Cup final?\nForest beat the champions of West Germany, courtesy of a John Robertson goal, in the Bernabeu, Madrid. And that was another adventure, if you listen to Martin Sneath’s tales, then 24, of joining thousands of fans travelling via trains and boats to the Spanish capital, without having anywhere to stay.\nUnable to get a hotel room, Sneath’s sleeping arrangements after Forest’s 1-0 win involved seeing “a large road sign leaning against a flyover and deciding to kip down there… after a freezing night with two hours’ sleep, I woke up covered in concrete dust with a hangover from hell”.\nIt was, he says, the time of his life, even if, on his return to Nottingham, he needed 24 hours in bed to sleep it off. “My dad came to pick me up,” says Sneath, a Forest-watcher since 1960. “He insisted all the car windows were open on the drive home because, as he said, I ‘stunk like a skunk’.”\nAnd now, 45 years on, perhaps it is time to pass the baton on to a younger generation. Everyone at Coffee Club would raise a glass to that. Or a cappuccino, maybe.\n“Would I do it again?” says Sneath. “Probably not, at my age. But was it worth it? Absolutely. If the guys travelling to watch in Europe this season have half as much fun as we did in those heady years, they are in for a treat.”\n(Top photo: Andrew Matthews, PA Images via Getty Images)",
