I could just claim I was giving in.'\n'It was perfect spraying at the journalists,' he was heard to say mischievously as he stood in an adjacent corridor to the press pack.\nHearing the conversation one reporter shot back: 'We're here!'\nWilliam shot his head around the corner, grinning: 'I know!'\nNatureMetrics is a UK based nature company which enables companies to measure and report on their impact on nature and ecosystems.\nThe company uses environmental DNA (eDNA) found in the surroundings to identify individual species using easy-to-collect water, air or soil samples.\nWilliam, 42, appeared to be in high spirits as he and local school children in Guildford filtered DNA samples through a syringe after extracting water from a local pond\nAnd the royal playfully turned the tables on the media, joyfully dousing them with the water collected and declaring: 'This is, like, the best day of my life!'\nDuring a pond-dipping session, he was handed a syringe from which samples would be taken to test what local wildlife and bacteria were present in the lake\nThe Prince of Wales was obviously in his element visiting the firm, a finalist in his 2024 Earthshot Prize awards, designed to scale up some of the most positive solutions to the global environmental crisis\nThis eDNA then offers a detailed picture of a site's biodiversity and a full spectrum of life, including anything from bacteria to blue whales, enabling businesses to understand the natural world around their operations and make informed operational and financial decisions, driving a shift towards a more sustainable global economy.\nSince becoming a Finalist, NatureMetrics has secured a $25 million investment, raised with support from The Earthshot Prize's investment platform Launchpad.\nDressed in practical boots, chinos and a jacket, William was initially taken down to a lake on the research park where local schoolchildren were helping to extract eDNA samples with founder Cat and social media science communicator 'Big Manny'.\n'Great so we can see how it actually works,' he said enthusiastically .\n'You guys are very good at science,' he added as the children spoke knowledgeable about what they were about to do.\nHe was asked to put on gloves so as not to contaminate the samples, Dr Bruce explaining that previously samples had been contaminated by the 'tuna sandwich people had for lunch'.\n'Look at the size of these syringes, wow!' he remarked.\nThis eDNA then offers a detailed picture of a site's biodiversity and a full spectrum of life, including anything from bacteria to blue whales\nThe Prince of Wales pictured with Dr Kat Bruce founder of nature metrics as they look at DNA samples extracted from areas around the world\n'Huge.
