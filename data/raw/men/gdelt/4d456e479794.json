Tottenham’s seven-match winless run in the league is its worst since 2008.\nPostecoglou said Tottenham’s current situation was “as low as we’ve been” this season and is banking on the imminent return of a number of key players — especially center backs Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven — to help turn round the team’s fortunes.\nAsked if he thinks he should be given that time, the Australian coach said: “Who knows mate? I reckon there’s a fair chunk that will say ‘no.’\n“When you’re a manager of a football club, you can be very vulnerable and isolated. I don’t feel that. I really feel like this group of players are giving everything for the club and I’ve got a group of staff who are really committed.”\nPostecoglou might only still be in a job because of his record in other competitions this season, with Spurs in the English League Cup semifinals — and leading Liverpool 1-0 after the first leg — and in the automatic qualification spots in the Europa League.\n“There’s still a fantastic opportunity this season to make an impact,” he said.\nTottenham’s league campaign is unraveling spectacularly, however, with only eight points separating the team from the relegation zone.\nManchester United is the other big club languishing in the bottom half of the standings, but now has two wins from its last three league games after beating Fulham 1-0 away thanks to Lisandro Martinez’s deflected effort in the 78th.\nPostecoglou believes Spurs fortunes ‘will turn’\nLeicester came from behind at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, scoring both of its goals early in the second half through Jamie Vardy in the 46th and Bilal El Khannouss in the 50th. Richarlison put Tottenham ahead in the 33rd.\n“From my perspective, I see a group of players that are giving as much as they can. I know it will turn,” said Postecoglou, who has been in charge of Tottenham since June 2023.\nTottenham has been beset with injuries this season, especially in defense, and was playing three days after a win at Hoffenheim in the Europa League.\n“They had to back it up today but there were probably at least two or three players that weren’t at 100%,” said Postecoglou, who later name-checked Richarlison and Pape Sarr. James Maddison was a late pull-out because of illness.\nTottenham was jeered at fulltime and Postecoglou was heckled by some fans as he walked down the tunnel after the game. Footage on social media showed him back-tracking in an effort to confront the supporters.\n“Certainly something I wanted to do when I took on the role was to try and unify the club and create a environment here where we’re all focused on the one thing,” Postecoglou said. “Obviously hasn’t worked out that way.”\nLeicester climbed out of the relegation zone with just a second win in 10 league games under Ruud van Nistelrooy, who was himself under scrutiny ahead of the game having only been hired in late November.\nInfantino sees Man United win\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino took in Man United’s latest game in the league and it was hardly a thriller at Fulham’s quaint Craven Cottage.\nThere were few chances throughout the match, with even the goal having a hint of fortune about it as Martinez took aim from long range and saw the ball loop up off Fulham midfielder Sasa Lukic’s outstretched boot and fly over goalkeeper Bernd Leno.\nSince Ruben Amorim said last weekend his team was “the worst, maybe, in the history of Manchester United,” it has won back-to-back games — Rangers in the Europa League on Thursday and Fulham three days later.\nMbeumo’s retaken penalty\nBrentford beat Crystal Palace 2-1 in a contest between midtable clubs which turned on a retaken penalty.\nBryan Mbeumo’s first attempt at the second-half spot kick hit the post and was cleared away by Palace defender Marc Guehi, who was penalized for encroachment after a video review. Mbeumo made no mistake with his second attempt.\nKevin Schade made it 2-0 to the visitors before Romain Esse pulled a goal back on his debut for Palace, two minutes after entering as a substitute.\nAston Villa drew 1-1 with West Ham in the other game.\nMore sports, gear and tickets\n- Where to watch Michigan State vs. Wisconsin today: College basketball free stream\n- Where to watch the NBA Celebrity All-Star Game for free today\n- Where to watch NASCAR Truck Series at Daytona tonight: Free live stream\n- How to watch Syracuse lacrosse vs No. 1 Maryland today for free\n- Where to watch USA women’s hockey vs. Italy today: Winter Olympics free stream\nWhat is Paramount Plus?\nParamount Plus is an over-the-top streaming service from Paramount, which includes content from Paramount-owned brands like CBS, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and more.
