  "body_text": "LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles Football Club wasted no time – or shots – as it ended a four-match home scoreless streak on Wednesday night at BMO Stadium.\nFifty-four seconds into a midseason showdown with the Seattle Sounders, Polish forward Mateusz Bogusz connected on the second sub-minute goal in LAFC history, a 1-0 game-winner.\n(Only Chicho Arango’s goal 20 seconds into a 2021 match against Real Salt Lake was quicker.)\nBogusz’s second goal with LAFC since transferring to MLS from Europe and goalkeeper John McCarthy’s sixth shutout elevated the club into sole possession of first place in the Western Conference (9-3-5, 32 points) for the first time since May 20, three points ahead of St. Louis City (9-7-2) and four above the Sounders (8-7-4).\n“We scouted a player who fits three positions on our team and that’s extremely valuable for us,” LAFC coach Steve Cherundolo said of Bogusz. “Especially in the tough stretch right now that we’re in with the depleted roster playing through the international window. Matty has seen a lot of minutes and taken advantage of that in multiple positions.\n“He’s kind of gelling and understanding the league better and the opponents and finding those spaces where he can be a game-changer or a difference-maker.”\nThe 21-year-old Bogusz, who joined LAFC from Leeds United on March 31, dribbled down the center of the field while Carlos Vela sprinted a few yards in front of him.\nConcerned that Bogusz would pass the ball to Vela, the Seattle center backs gave ground until the young winger took his opportunity, hitting a shot that deflected off Sounders defender Jackson Ragen and beat goalkeeper Stefan Frei, who entered the match with a league-best nine shutouts.\nWith injuries and international call-ups influencing the lineup, Bogusz started in the midfield, supporting a first-choice attack that included Vela, Mahala Opoku and Dénis Bouanga, who missed the past two matches while on international duty for Gabon.\nUnlike the last time Bouanga played in Africa in late March, the French-born forward didn’t have to sprint 10,000 miles to save the day.\nBogusz had not arrived in L.A. when Bouanga scored a game-winner on March 25 after playing 90 minutes in an African Cup of Nations qualifier and immediately turning around for a 26-hour trip back to the U.S. that dropped him off at BMO Stadium shortly before kickoff against FC Dallas.\nThanks to Bogusz and a strong defensive effort that limited Seattle to two shots on goal, Bouanga, who played 59 minutes on Wednesday, didn’t have to put on his Black & Gold cape again.\nSeattle dropped to 0-6-1 in regular-season matches at BMO Stadium, and, following a scoreless draw at Lumen Field in mid-March, did not score in its home-and-home series with LAFC.\nDue to national team call-ups, Seattle was without Jordan Morris (U.S.) as well as Cristian Roldan (U.S.) and Alex Roldan (El Salvador).\nLAFC was without American international Aaron Long, midfielders Timothy Tillman and Kellyn Acosta, both recuperating from hamstring injuries, and center back Jesus Murillo, who sprained an ankle in the club’s last match.\nOpoku opened the door for Bogusz’s first-minute run, delivering a give-and-go combination at midfield that released the fast-footed Pole for the earliest goal of his career.\nPiggybacking off a road win in Kansas City on Saturday, when Bogusz earned his first MLS assist, LAFC has regrouped from a poor stretch of results since the two-leg CONCACAF Champions League final earlier this month.\n“I’m very happy to get three points at home,” Bogusz said. “It had been a long time.”\nThrough 17 league matches, LAFC is fourth in the Supporters’ Shield standings, 11 points behind FC Cincinnati with a game in hand.\n“We picked up where we left off last season,” Cherundolo said. “We’ve been thrown through the gauntlet. It’s been really difficult physically and mentally to get everybody ready in a three- or four-day rhythm. Hats off to the players. They’ve done fantastic. Top of the West. Playing in the Champions League final. A game in hand, I believe. It’s pretty good. We’re very happy with those results.”\nThey can make it three straight in league play when the Vancouver Whitecaps, who LAFC defeated in the CCL quarterfinal round, visit BMO Stadium on Saturday night.",
