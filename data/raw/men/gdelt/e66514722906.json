Give him a chance!\nOh no, the media desperate to want to portray this as proof of England having made a terrible mistake, Thomas Tuchel clearly not the right man for the job.\nNothing like wanting to make so much out of so little, nothing like wanting to make a snap judgement without giving someone a chance first.\nWhich brings me to Dan Burn.\nI have no doubt that many of these journalists already had their articles written, waiting for any justification to put their nonsense out.\nThe ‘proof’ that Dan Burn clearly isn’t ‘international class’, according to them.\nI thought that overall, Dan Burn did decent.\nHe was part of the endless passing of the ball that got England nowhere most of the time, he was a threat at set-pieces and hit the bar with one header, whilst at the back he played ok but a couple of times an Albania attacking player got the better of him.\nYou can of course guess what all the journalists wanted to only concentrate on. A couple of bad defensive moments, yes, like we have never ever seen this before from the likes of Stones, Maguire, Pickford, Walker and so on.\nHow is that ‘proof’ that Dan Burn isn’t up to international standard/class?\nWhat exactly is international standard/class anyway?\nThe Premier League is the best, toughest and most competitive in the world, if you play week in week out in the Premier League and do well, then why is suddenly magically more difficult playing against inferior teams, the international ones?\nIs playing Albania tougher than facing Arsenal, Forest and Liverpool?\nIt is like when Newcastle United qualified for the Champions League and people making out like that is some magical massive step up when playing against your average continental opposition. As it happened, Newcastle weren’t given typical last season, they were give the toughest group imaginable, in AC Milan, PSG and Borussia Dortmund.\nDan Burn was only able to start three of the six Champions League matches due to injury issues. He started in the match at the San Siro where United kept a clean sheet, Dan Burn scored as NUFC hammered eventual semi-finalists PSG 4-1, whilst he was in the team that lost 1-0 to eventual finalists Dortmund.\nFine margins and a terrible VAR decision in Paris prevented Newcastle United from progressing BUT Dan Burn and his teammates showed they were every competitive at Champions League standard.\nIt is laughable how the journalists want to disrespect the opposition to try and prove their points about Dan Burn and Thomas Tuchel. Making out that Albania are pub team level.\nAlbania were at the Euros nine months ago and handed the toughest of groups, unlike England, as usual. Albania took the lead against Italy before losing narrowly 2-1, then drew 2-2 with Croatia, before losing narrowly 1-0 to eventual champions Spain. Gareth Southgate was handed the easiest group possible and yet lucky to crawl through eventually. If England had been handed the three group opponents Albania were given, I doubt we’d have even progressed under boring boring Gareth.\nBBC Sport invite visitors to mark all the players in each match and these were the collective average marks out of 10 for the England players against Albania:\nPretty fair I think, Dan Burn rated fifth best, which I reckon is fair enough. As I say, he didn’t have a nightmare, he did ok overall. There was no ‘proof’ of lacking international quality, whatever that is.\nThese are the Whoscored automated ratings for the match:\nA little generous generally on the England team but Dan Burn rated fourth highest of the home players.\nThe embarrassing transparent media agenda against both Thomas Tuchel and Dan Burn has been brutally exposed.\nIf Friday night was some great example of a terrible performance, tactics and team selection, then the fact is that we saw 50, 60 or more examples under Gareth Southgate.\nThomas Tuchel, Dan Burn and England will improve, this is just the first step.\nNothing I have seen tells me that manager and player don’t belong in the national set-up.\nDan Burn proves himself week in week out for Newcastle United and that is proof enough for me.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
