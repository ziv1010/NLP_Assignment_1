  "body_text": "Champions LeagueThe opposition lowdown: PSV Eindhoven\nLiverpool wrap up the league phase of the Champions League at PSV Eindhoven tonight – here, we take a closer look at the Dutch side.\nRecent form\nAll scenarios are on the table for Peter Bosz's team as they enter matchday eight: last-16 qualification, a knockout play-off place and elimination.\nThat said, by far the most likely end result for PSV is a spot in the play-offs.\nThey currently sit 19th in the league-phase standings on 11 points and with three victories, the last of which came away at Red Star Belgrade. Their other victories were over Shakhtar Donetsk and Girona.\nIn the Eredivisie, the reigning champions occupy top spot in the 2024-25 edition with a four-point lead and beat NAC Breda 3-2 on Saturday.\nOnes to watch\nUSA forward Ricardo Pepi is PSV's biggest threat in front of goal this season.\nThe 22-year-old has scored 16 goals from his 27 appearances in all competitions. Next best in the team is captain Luuk de Jong with 13.\nTheir creative spark is likely to come from Morocco international Ismael Saibari, who has 10 assists to his name in 2024-25 thus far.\nTeam news\nBosz will need to make three enforced changes to the line-up he deployed last weekend.\nRyan Flamingo is suspended following his sending-off in their last Champions League outing, Ivan Perisic is not registered in the competition and Jerdy Schouten has been ruled out.\nSergino Dest, Malick Tillman and Couhaib Driouech have been out with injury.\nAdamo Nagalo (shoulder) and Noa Lang (illness) will be assessed ahead of the 8pm GMT kick-off.\nWhat was said\nPSV head coach Bosz\n\"The goal is to reach the next round. With one point we are certain of the play-off round. The self-confidence is there but we are going to play against perhaps the best club in Europe – if not in the world.\n\"I am looking forward to these kinds of matches. The UEFA Champions League is great in general and then also against the leaders. We can see if we can compete at this level.\"\nPre-match stats\nPSV have never beaten Liverpool in six previous attempts (drawn one, lost five) – the joint-most times they have faced an opponent in major European competition without ever winning.\nThey are unbeaten in each of their last 11 home games in major European competition (won six, drawn five) since a 2-1 loss to Leicester City in April 2022 in the Conference League.\nBosz's men have won their last two home Champions League fixtures at Philips Stadium – last winning three in a row in the 2015-16 group stage. They scored at least three goals in both wins.\nDe Jong could become PSV's all-time top scorer in the European Cup/Champions League, with the Dutchman currently level with Romario on 11 goals. He netted a brace last time out in this competition.\nOpposition view\nMichael Bell, editor of Football-Oranje\nOn the season so far...\nPSV won the Eredivisie easily last season and expectations were high going into this campaign. They are top of the league, but it has not been as smooth for Bosz’s side and they have suffered some poor losses.\nThey are four points ahead of Ajax at the top of the table, though their rivals have a game in hand. The Champions League has been mostly positive apart from the defeat to Stade Brest. They did well to draw 1-1 at PSG and blew Girona away 4-0. In the last match they survived a red card and held on for a crucial 3-2 win over Red Star Belgrade to keep their play-off hopes on track. With a three-point cushion they are almost assured of a place in the play-off round going into the final round of games, so it has been a good campaign in the competition so far.\nOn PSV's key players...\nDe Jong is still a decisive player up top for PSV but he has been overtaken as top scorer this season by the American striker Pepi, who will start v Liverpool. He is technical, can drop into the 10 position and is a great finisher.\nOn the wing they also have Johan Bakayoko who is interesting some of the biggest clubs in Europe and the press have even linked him to Liverpool, so I'm sure fans will want to see him in action. Ismail Saibari is also a very talented young attacking midfielder who can score goals! Sadly the key midfielder Schouten has been ruled out with an injury and that is a big blow.\nOn PSV's style of play...\nPeter Bosz is an attack-minded coach who usually opts for the traditional 4-3-3 formation. With De Jong as a focal point and two speedy attackers, PSV like to dominate possession and get crosses into the box. Defending has been an issue for PSV since the start of the year and it will need to be much tighter at the back if they are to get a result against Liverpool.\nHowever, Mauro Junior and Rick Karsdorp are two attacking full-backs who like to get forward and overlap the wingers. Bosz will certainly set his side up to attack and he won’t try and park the bus against Liverpool.\nPSV predicted XI: Benitez, Karsdorp, Junior, Boscagli, Flamingo, Veerman, Saibari, Pepi, Bakayoko, Peresic, De Jong.",
