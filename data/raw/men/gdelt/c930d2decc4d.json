The top two teams from each group will advance to the quarterfinals and secure their places at the global showpiece.\nHosts Saudi Arabia headline the tournament as top seeds, joined by Asia’s leading youth football nations and several emerging teams that impressed during the qualification phase.

However, their path to qualification has become significantly more complicated.\nTo secure a place in the Super 8 stage, Afghanistan must win their remaining two matches against the United Arab Emirates and Canada — and do so by substantial margins to improve their net run rate. At the same time, they will need either New Zealand or South Africa to suffer heavy defeats in their remaining group fixtures.\nIf these conditions are met, Afghanistan could still break into the top two based on a superior net run rate. While the scenario is challenging, qualification remains mathematically possible — keeping Afghan hopes alive in the tournament.\n-\nSport5 days ago\nChampions League Elite action continues as qualification race tightens\n-\nInternational Sports4 days ago\nIPL 2026: Franchise sales gather pace as global investors circle teams\n-\nSport5 days ago\nEarly medal leaders emerge as Winter Olympics continue in Italy\n-\nLatest News4 days ago\nTerrorist activities observed along Afghanistan borders, says Lavrov\n-\nWorld5 days ago\nHong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai sentenced to 20 years in jail in national security trial\n-\nLatest News5 days ago\nPakistan president claims situation in Afghanistan is ‘similar to or worse than pre-9/11’’\n-\nBusiness4 days ago\nUzbekistan approves feasibility study agreement for Trans-Afghan Railway\n-\nSport2 days ago\nAfghanistan’s semi-final hopes hang in the balance after two T20 World Cup defeats",
