  "body_text": "Chelsea have been linked with a few Bayern Munich players lately. We have all heard of the recent rumours regarding their centre-back Dayot Upamecano, who is set to be out of contract in the summer. The Frenchman is proven at the top level for both club and country. Also, it looks like the Blues could be looking at one of the club's brightest young talents at the same time.\nChelsea have built up a reputation for signing wonderkids from all around world football under their new recruitment model. And one cannot say that it has produced exceptional results so far.\nThe Club World Cup win was brilliant but the aim has to be to compete for the Premier League and the Champions League consistently. The Blues are not even close to doing that despite spending more than a billion pounds since the Clearlake-Boehly takeover.\nYet, it looks like they are going to stick to their ideas, whether they are right or wrong. And the latest name to be linked with Chelsea is a 17-year-old Bayern Munich winger who recently broke a Champions League record for the Bavarians.\nChelsea interested in €80 million Bayern Munich winger\nBayern Munich are known for signing the best talents from other Bundesliga clubs. But from time to time, their academy can produce some exceptional youngsters as well. Lennart Karl falls under that category.\nKarl has scored a couple of goals already this season. One of them was in the Champions League, which made him the youngest to do so in the history of the iconic Bavarian club.\nHis form is drawing the attention of top teams as well. As reported by CaughtOffside, representatives from Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester City were in attendance to watch Karl.\nOf course, Bayern Munich are rarely willing to part ways with their best players. So, it will be interesting to see if Chelsea are able to make a successful approach for Karl in the future. At the moment, his transfer valuation is believed to be in the region of €80 million. A staggering sum for someone with only two top division goals to his name.",
