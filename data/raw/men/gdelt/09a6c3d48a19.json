Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nBut widespread reports say Ederson is in advanced talks with Galatasaray, who have made a bid worth £8.5m to Man City.\nWhile the Premier League giants are holding out for move, it appears only a matter of time before the deal goes through as Ederson has already given the green light to the move.\nEderson, who turns 32 on Sunday, will leave Man City as one of the greatest goalkeeper in Premier League history.\nAs well as winning six league titles, he has two FA Cups, three League Cups and the Champions League on his CV. Ederson won the Premier League Golden Glove three seasons in a row.\nAsked about Ederson and Savinho’s future at the Etihad Stadium in his pre-match press conference, Guardiola said: ‘If they want to leave, they will come to me.\n‘If they want to leave, they will knock on my door. Whether it’s Tottenham in that case or any other club, a player should call the club.\n‘I am only concerned right now that Savinho will be with us for the rest of the season and hopefully many years, because of the potential he has at 21. He has to improve in final positions but he is an extraordinary player.\n‘At the end, as always, the desire of the players is above everything but then they have to find an agreement with the club.\n‘If they don’t make an agreement, the player will be here because the club spends money on those players.’\nMore Trending\nWith Ederson pushing to leave the club, Manchester City have expressed interest in signing Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris Saint-Germain.\nDonnarumma was left out of Luis Enrique’s PSG squad for the UEFA Super Cup clash against Tottenham on Wednesday night.\nPSG were hopeful of tying Donnarumma down to a new deal earlier in the summer but have denied to cash in after signing new No. 1 Lucas Chevalier from Lille.\nDonnarumma, a Champions League and Euros winner, is open to a move to the Premier League and is said to be ‘fascinated’ by Guardiola, though he is also interested in joining Chelsea.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Enzo Maresca demands new signing as Chelsea star misses Crystal Palace clash\nMORE: Why Arsenal pulled out of Eberechi Eze transfer race\nMORE: Virgil van Dijk sends message to Liverpool owners over Marc Guehi transfer",
