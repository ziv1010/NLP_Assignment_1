This brilliant start to the season comes after a tremendous 2024-25 campaign that saw them lift the Cup for the first time in their history.\nLes Parisiens, in their last outing of the Champions League against Bayer Leverkusen, hammered the Bundesliga side 7-2, and their last league win against Nice in the Ligue 1 means that Luis Enrique’s men remain top of the table in both the French first division and the European top flight.\nThe German side have also been in red-hot form recently; Bayern Munich have registered victories in all of the fixtures that they have participated in in this season. The attacking trio of Michael Olise, Harry Kane and Luis Diaz have helped the Bavarians score a staggering 54 goals in all competitions already.\nVincent Kompany’s men managed to thrash Club Brugge 4-0 in their last outing in the UEFA Champions League. This result paved the way for further onslaughts, including a 3-0 victory over Borussia Monchengladbach, a 4-1 win against F.C. Koln, and a 3-0 victory over Bayer Leverkusen.\nThis string of victories means that Bayern sit at the top of the Bundesliga table with a comfortable points difference, and are second only to the defending champions in the league phase of the UEFA Champions League.\nCurrent forms and recent results of both teams point to a very entertaining contest that could go either way. A high-scoring draw is highly probable.",
