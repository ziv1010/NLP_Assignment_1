Therefore, the best thing for him is to be playing regular first-team football this season.\n“And he will certainly get regular first-team football with Bologna.”\nThe writing was on the wall for new signing Iling-Junior after Aston Villa also agreed a swoop for Jaden Philogene earlier in the transfer window.\nIling-Junior played just shy of 800 minutes of Serie A football for Juventus last season across 24 appearances but Emery doesn’t feel that makes him Premier League-ready.\nHe signed earlier in the current window but is set to go straight back to Italy on loan.\nWith a pair of 22-year-old left-wingers in Philogene and Morgan Rogers on their books, Aston Villa might look to bring in an experienced hand before the end of the summer transfer window.\nREAD MORE – Keown warns Arsenal against transfer gaffe as Aston Villa urged to sign ‘Emery style’ forward instead\nOrnstein: Aston Villa are NOT in talks for Raheem Sterling\nReports have suggested that a move for unsettled Chelsea star Raheem Sterling could be on the cards.\nRogers was Villa’s top scorer in the League cup last season and Philogene is highly-rated but banking on two youngsters in a key position could come back to haunt Emery.\nAston Villa have reportedly expressed interest in acquiring Sterling this summer, as Emery seeks to assemble a trophy-winning group.\nVilla have done some handy business this summer as they prepare for a Champions League campaign, but they might yet make some more signings after being given a reality check by Arsenal this past weekend.\nThe 29-year-old Sterling has plenty of top-level experience, having played for Liverpool, Manchester City, and now Chelsea, and could be a big addition to an ambitious Villa outfit.\nHowever, we understand that Sterling’s preference is to join Manchester United this summer, amid claims that Chelsea are exploring a swap deal, using him and Ben Chilwell in exchange for Jadon Sancho.\nDavid Ornstein has also claimed that Aston Villa’s links with Sterling are wide of the mark and no contact has yet been made for his signing.\nNEXT READ – All the done deals by Premier League clubs in the summer 2024 transfer window",
