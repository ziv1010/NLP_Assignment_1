Then an Alexander Isak-shaped spanner landed in the works.\nPREMIER LEAGUE 5th\nFA CUP Fifth Round\nLEAGUE CUP Winners\nTOP SCORER (ALL COMPS) Alexander Isak (27)\nNewcastle commenced the summer needing quality additions on the right wing and in central defence, a reliable back-up/replacement striker to Alexander Isak, a talented young goalkeeper who could succeed Nick Pope, and a right winger and a centre-back. In short, the Magpies need to sign several players capable of going straight into the first team, and that is something they have failed to do in the last three windows.\nThe Coach\nEddie Howe can just pick a plot for his statue at the incoming (unconfirmed, but inevitable) new stadium. Winning a trophy took him above Kevin Keegan and Sir Bobby Robson in fans’ estimations, and praise really doesn’t come higher. Back him, trust him and reap the rewards. But a lack of support from above, and constant failure to land key targets only serve to push him closer to the exit door when the right opportunity comes.\nKey player\nNewcastle fans are excited to see Sandro Tonali do Sandro Tonali things on the Champions League stage again. As perhaps the most important cog in this team, the Adam Driver lookalike takes pressure off the defence and enables Bruno Guimaraes to thrive higher up the pitch.\nLesson from last year\nFor all of the success on the pitch, there’s been a big lack of stability off it. Four senior figures (Amanda Staveley, Mehrdad Ghodoussi, Dan Ashworth and Paul Mitchell) have already come and gone since the 2021 takeover, and current CEO Darren Eales is expected to make it five due to health reasons.\nThis preview originally appeared in FourFourTwo's Season Preview issue which went on sale in July, available here with free delivery\nNewcastle need to appoint a top sporting director who can work in harmony with the manager. Mitchell, who replaced Ashworth last summer, couldn’t do that and seemed to take the hint, resigning after just a year. Just as important is Eales’ replacement: Newcastle’s commercial income is still lagging behind clubs around them in the Deloitte Football Money League.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nThe Mood\nGrowing disallusion. With the trophy monkey off their backs, Newcastle hoped to push for more of them and become a real nuisance to Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea. But transfer target gazumpings by two of those clubs (three if Isak moves to Merseyside) has been hugely depressing.\nOne to watch\nIn his first season, William Osula showed glimpses in cup games and scored a fine looping header in April’s league game against Ipswich. Encouragingly, he spent this summer racking up goals for Denmark in the Under-21 Euros.\nMost likely to...\nLose the coin toss.\nTITLE ODDS 14/1\nAs the St James’ Park pitch slopes towards the Gallowgate End, Newcastle prefer to kick down it in the second half. But Bruno Guimaraes is flipping rubbish at calling heads or tails, so they’re regularly ‘spun’ by visiting captains, to home fans’ irritation.\nLeast likely to…\nAccept the incoming badge update quietly. The club have announced plans to ‘refine and revive’ their current crest for 2026/27. It’s probably overdue with the current badge designed by hand in 1988 and never properly digitised, making it hard to reproduce with clarity. Manchester United and Sunderland are the only other Premier League clubs not to update this side of the millennium.\nFFT verdict\n4TH The Magpies are a few judicious signings away from ascending to the top table. They’re set to fly.\nThe Number Cruncher\nFan view\nNewcastle are looking to build on a historic season – True Faith podcast host Alex Hurst gives the view from the stands of how life is looking for the Toon…\nLast season was the best in our modern history.\nThe big talking point is PSR – again. But finally, Howe can sign players ready for the first team.\nOur key player will be Isak (if he stays) who scored 27 goals last season despite being poor for the first third of it and probably playing with an injury for the last third.\nLook out for midfielder Alfie Harrison. He joined from Manchester City in 2024 and, at 19, could be ready to play for the first team with our additional fixtures this season.\nThe pantomime villain will be Jordan Pickford.\nThe opposition player who grinds my gears is Amad Diallo. He was once on loan at Sunderland, and now he clowns around pretending he hates us for social media points from the fanbase of a club he represented for about five minutes and left as soon as he could. Play for them if you like them that much.\nThe active player I’d love to have back is Chris Wood, because we simply didn’t replace him.\nThe one change I’d make would be genuine communication with supporters. There is none.\nFans think our gaffer is guaranteed to go down in history as an all-time great. He’s calm and has held the whole ‘project’ together at times. Howe has a bad habit of making unnecessary formation or system changes at the end of seasons, but apart from that he’s perfect.\nIf he left, he should be replaced by his assistant, Jason Tindall.\nWe’ll finish 5th.\nThese previews originally appeared in FourFourTwo's Season Preview issue which went on sale in July, available here with free delivery\nKetch joined FourFourTwo as Deputy Editor in 2022 having racked up appearances at Reach PLC as a Northern Football Editor and BBC Match of the Day magazine as their Digital Editor and Senior Writer.
