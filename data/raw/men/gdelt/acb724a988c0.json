  "body_text": "Some players just have it.\nThat innate ability to set standards. The masterful oratory skills to deliver a chest-thumping inspirational speech. Maybe they’ve already developed all of the world-weariness necessary to liken a pesky journalist to a flightless bird in a tense press-conference exchange.\nAdvertisement\nSometimes it’s obvious when a player looks destined to become a manager after they hang up their boots.\nHere, The Athletic’s Premier League writers look into their crystal balls to predict which player from your club looks most likely to swap the pitch for the touchline once their own race is run.\nArsenal\nIt’s tempting to choose Ben White for the very simple reason that he could deliver the classic post-match interview dodge of “I didn’t see it” without a hint of bullshit. The big man genuinely wouldn’t have been watching.\nBut you probably have to be a football obsessive and Arsenal have three players already doing their badges — Mohamed Elneny, Rob Holding and Granit Xhaka. Midfielders are usually the most cerebral players but as suave as Xhaka would look in a suit, his temperament is a slight concern.\nThat’s why the captain, Martin Odegaard, makes sense. He is Arteta’s brain on the pitch, he conducts play as if he is watching from above and he can rouse his team when needed, too.\nGO DEEPER\nAlmost every top club wanted the teenage Martin Odegaard - this is how the chase unfolded\nHaving been hyped as a world-class talent since making his debut at 13 before learning about the pressure of Real Madrid and underpinning Arsenal’s rebuild, Odegaard has the range of experiences to go with his football intelligence.\nJordan Campbell\nAston Villa\nTyrone Mings strikes me as a professional that is here to stay.\nHe’s already worked as a shop assistant, barman, and mortgage advisor, as well as owning an interior design business, so perhaps he’ll actually end up working on Dragon’s Den or hosting the Royal Variety Performance.\nGO DEEPER\nThe making of ‘the most lovely man’ Mings: From homeless shelter to personal chef and extra sessions with Terry\nThe safer bet, though, would be sticking in football and using his experiences to create a winning team. He’s already helping shape the next generation of footballers through his academy. Plus, he speaks well, has played at a high level, and is comfortable cruising through football without making close-knit friends.\nHis father Adie was also a manager, so could teach him a thing or two.\nGregg Evans\nAdvertisement\nBournemouth\nManagers at all levels are happy to appeal any decision with vigour. If you close your eyes, you can almost see the gritted teeth and shouty, pointy demeanour of countless managers.\nEven if there is blatant evidence to show that your player is in the wrong, the look of sheer aghast on a manager’s face when even the most inconsequential call does not go his side’s way can feel like a matter of life and death.\nThat’s one of the main reasons Adam Smith would make a great manager. His insistence on trying to get the officials to second-guess everything would make the most seasoned head coaches proud. At 31, leadership is something that comes easily to Smith, and his role-model status among the Bournemouth squad should allow for a smooth transition into coaching.\nSmith can draw on 13 years of professional football experience, from League Two to the Premier League, and was named Bournemouth’s stand-in captain while Lloyd Kelly recovered from an ankle injury.\nGiven his positive influence on younger players and vociferous appeals to referees, you wouldn’t suspect much would change in Smith’s outlook if he embarked on a managerial career.\nAhmed Shooble\nBrentford\nBen Mee’s assured performance on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football show last week and his World Cup column for The Athletic suggest he could have a successful career in the media when he retires — but he surely belongs in the dugout.\nThe 33-year-old defender already has some experience in the dugout after helping Mike Jackson manage Burnley towards the end of last season when Sean Dyche was sacked. Mee was Burnley’s captain for three years and quickly became a well-respected figure in Brentford’s dressing room after joining last summer.\nVidic or VVD? @Carra23 puts Ben Mee on the spot 😅👀 pic.twitter.com/3rs9x4KdyO\n— Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) April 17, 2023\nThe centre-back was never blessed with pace and relies on reading the game to anticipate problems, which would be very useful as a coach. He has spoken intelligently on topics outside of football, including racism and climate change, which is further evidence of his natural leadership ability.\nAdvertisement\nAn alternative would be Christian Norgaard. The Denmark international has a fantastic relationship with Thomas Frank and often relays instructions from the bench to the rest of his team-mates. He leads the discussion in Brentford’s pre-match huddle before every game, as well.\nJay Harris\nBrighton\nAn obvious pick can also be the right pick: in this instance, Adam Lallana.\nWe’ve seen often enough that a high-class playing pedigree doesn’t always lead to success in coaching and management, but the former Liverpool and England midfielder looks made for the transition once his playing days are over.\nGO DEEPER\nLallana has brought 'Liverpool standards' to Brighton's approach and training\nLallana turns 35 in May but still has a lot to offer on the pitch, having recently signed a new contract until June 2024.\nHis vocal influence was clear in games without crowds during the COVID-19 lockdown. He also has a sharp mind and a high level of tactical understanding. Head coach Roberto De Zerbi has described Lallana as a “teacher”.\nAndy Naylor\nChelsea\nWhen you think of Chelsea right now, part of the problem has been a lack of leaders and personalities who have what it takes to be a head coach.\nThere are some veterans coming toward the end of their careers who spring to mind, such as Thiago Silva and Cesar Azpilicueta.\nBut for a more random choice, the growing maturity of keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga is one to watch. Few players at Stamford Bridge have had to play under as much scrutiny and pressure as him.\nFrom being the world’s most expensive goalkeeper to refusing to be substituted in the Carabao Cup final and being dropped following a string of mistakes, Kepa has emerged to become Chelsea’s No 1 again. To overcome all that takes fortitude.\nThe Spain international has mastered English. Speaking multiple languages is an important skill in modern management and he looked very comfortable in front of a critical press room before Chelsea’s home game against Real Madrid. It was also noticeable how during a break in play in the Brighton fixture recently, it was Kepa who pulled players aside to issue instructions and tactical advice.\nAdvertisement\nAt 28, he has time to decide what to do following his professional career but Kepa is one to keep an eye on.\nSimon Johnson\nCrystal Palace\nThis one is easy. Talk to James McArthur about going into management and he will bristle at the word because it implies he is ready to retire.\nThat is far from the case, despite he struggles with injury over the last three seasons. He is determined to keep his playing career going but a move into coaching would suit him down to the ground when he does hang up his boots.\nGO DEEPER\nWhy McArthur can spark Palace - even without kicking a ball\nHis authority is unrivalled. On and off the pitch, his influence is integral as he organises, supports and motivates his Palace team-mates. That was most evident during games behind closed doors when his voice boomed from the stands. The instructions were simple but effective, mostly encouraging words — especially for the younger members of the squad.\nThe leadership skills he possesses would translate well into management.\nMatt Woosnam\nEverton\nSeamus Coleman has a quiet air of authority, a keen mind and a burning ambition to carry on in the game as a coach when he calls time on his playing career.\nThe Everton captain is out of contract in the summer and, at 34, has yet to indicate if he will sign another extension or retire to concentrate on the next step.\nColeman gained his UEFA B coaching licence with the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) in 2020 — a UEFA A licence, enabling him to manage professionally, is next.\nGO DEEPER\nSeamus Coleman: Everton's 'glue' who continues to set the standards\nHis team-mates talk of him as leading by example with his high professional standards and conduct around the club, and he is also unafraid to dish out some hard truths when required.\nAfter learning from a wide range of top managers, from David Moyes to Carlo Ancelotti, it will be no surprise to see him in the dugout shouting the orders before long.\nGreg O’Keeffe\nAdvertisement\nFulham\nTim Ream seems the obvious choice but he is not someone you would traditionally associate with a managerial role.\nHe is a very composed presence, not just in the heart of Fulham’s defence, but in the dressing room, too. He also sports a healthy man bun, which is probably the biggest possible violation of the Scott Parker guide to looking the part on the touchline.\nDespite his nonchalant attitude, Ream still carries an infectious poise, epitomised by the roar of “REAMMM” from the Fulham supporters every time he wins possession.\nGO DEEPER\nTim Ream on his 'special' year: The World Cup, a title with Fulham... and a goal\nHe is not the most vocal Fulham player on the pitch but the 35-year-old articulates himself very well and should have no issues with man-management.\nDependable, unflappable and charming — what more could you want in a manager?\nAhmed Shooble\nLeeds\nAdam Forshaw — and this isn’t a dig about the amount of time he’s had to think about the future while dealing with injury.\nForshaw is a thinker, a clever guy with a level head, and he’s discussed doing coaching badges and preparing for what comes next. He’s also spoken about the notes he made during Marcelo Bielsa’s time as head coach at Leeds, taking tips and learning lessons from the best of what went on in that period to give him ideas for further down the line.\nGO DEEPER\nAdam Forshaw's long journey back: 'I wasn't sure I would play football at any level again'\nForshaw gives the impression of someone with a definite taste for management when his playing days are done and you could see it working out for him.\nPhil Hay\nLeicester City\nJonny Evans would be the obvious candidate within the Leicester City squad to go on to become a manager.\nThe Northern Irishman is a natural leader: calm in all situations and authoritative. He is already doing his coaching badges with one eye on his next move within the game.\nHe has had one of the best football educations possible under Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United but successful managers since he left Old Trafford have felt they could turn to Evans to quietly lead the troops.\nBut how about one out of leftfield? How about Jamie Vardy in the technical area, pumped up, swaggering, gesticulating to the fourth official and taunting the opposition fans, all while crushing cans of Red Bull — now that would be a sight to behold.\nRob Tanner\nAdvertisement\nLiverpool\nNever mind the mentality monsters. Imagine James Milner’s professionals.\nHe would assemble a team of CrossFit champions who eat lactate tests for breakfast. They’d be pressing titans with calves that would make Jack Grealish jealous and hearts as big as Liverpool.\nFines for tiny shin pads. Compulsory Spanish lessons. Spinning classes with Ben Foster. Off-trail running with the Brownlee brothers. Everyone has a LinkedIn Premium account and a National Trust membership.\nGO DEEPER\n20 years of James Milner, a Premier League legend who has always ticked every box\nDecaf Yorkshire Tea drinkers. Ribena for special occasions. And by the end of the season, every player must have been used in at least three different positions. If not, your contract recycles itself.\nThe only question is when. Milner has made more than 800 appearances and is maturing like Benjamin Button. So maybe he takes the player-coach route to reach 1,000 games.\nCaoimhe O’Neill\nManchester City\nGiven that disciples of Pep Guardiola currently occupy the top spots in the Premier League, the Championship and La Liga, you could argue that Manchester City are likeliest to produce the next great managerial talent.\nAnd if any member of the squad is destined for the dugout, it’s probably Ilkay Gundogan.\nThat’s not least because Gundogan is an avid Football Manager player, fronting the promotional campaign for this season’s edition of the popular video game after revealing he had spent much of his free time last season guiding West Bromwich Albion to promotion.\nThe preparations never stop… 🤓⚽ Just a normal football evening at home 🤷🏻♂️ pic.twitter.com/rzUn3R8jf5\n— Ilkay Gündogan (@IlkayGuendogan) January 12, 2022\nGundogan also has management ambitions ‘IRL’, though, or is at least keeping his options open for once he hangs up his boots. The 32-year-old began his coaching badges with the German FA at the beginning of last season, taking sessions with City’s under-16s as part of his studies.\nWith his UEFA B Licence completed, he is set to start his A Licence course next season.\nAdvertisement\nGuardiola believes Gundogan has what it takes. As one of the few in world football to play under him and Jurgen Klopp — as well as Thomas Tuchel, Joachim Low and Hansi Flick — Gundogan has learned from the best of this coaching generation. He could be someone to watch in the next one.\nMark Critchley\nManchester United\n“Tell them I’ll fix this” was Casemiro’s message to his agent after watching United’s 4-0 defeat to Brentford early this season.\nThe 31-year-old has gone a long way to patching up the holes in Erik ten Hag’s side this season (when available) and looks well-placed to make the jump to management.\nThe Brazilian already has a headstart on the evaluation part of the job, watching reports using the scouting and analysis platform Wyscout after his own games. He also has a feel for statistics, examining his performances and looking at where he could further improve.\nGO DEEPER\nIn Casemiro, Manchester United have a holding midfielder who can finish off moves\nA Casemiro-led team could impart lessons from Carlo Ancelotti, Zinedine Zidane and Tite. There’d be plenty of anecdotes about what it takes to win in high-pressure environments, and how to navigate tricky Champions League games. They’d be masters of the dark arts and able to avoid yellow cards. (At least until they come to England.)\nGot a struggling mid-table side that needs to learn the values of grit and grind? Want to be sneakily good at long-range shots? Are you willing to overlook some weakness playing out of the press in the first phase? Can you get some loan deals from the imaginary clubs also managed by Toni Kroos and Luka Modric?\nCall Casemiro. He’ll fix this.\nCarl Anka\nNewcastle United\nKieran Trippier has experienced it all. Lower-league football. Challenging for the Premier League. Winning La Liga. Star turns in the World Cup and Champions League.\nWhen joining Newcastle, he was excited to have his name writ into a project. That’s the type of motivation that managers need — especially those who are former players.\nAdvertisement\nTactical acumen? Look at how quickly he picked up Diego Simeone’s complex system and the speed with which Newcastle’s defence has improved with him at its heart.\nGO DEEPER\nI love Kieran Trippier\nCulture and leadership? This is a man who went to every away game last season, even while out for three months with a foot injury — not typical Premier League practice — and who has taken over the captaincy with Jamaal Lascelles no longer in the starting XI.\nBet he’ll take some mean set pieces in training sessions, too.\nJacob Whitehead\nNottingham Forest\n“He was in my office this morning… again.”\nSteve Cooper is not the first manager to experience the enthusiasm of Ryan Yates.\nFor the Nottingham Forest midfielder, improvement is almost an obsession. Whether it comes from viewing video clips of his performances or from seeking the opinion of his head coach, Yates’ daily priority is to find ways of making himself better.\nHaving gone out on loan to Barrow, Scunthorpe United, Shrewsbury Town and Notts County, the 25-year-old has played in each of the five top divisions in English football.\nIt is not a criticism to say that he has thrived because of his attitude, as much as his ability, proving doubters wrong along the way, not least in showing he can cut it in the Premier League.\nYates’ drive and determination would provide solid foundations for a manager.\nPaul Taylor\nSouthampton\nAlas, ask me a year ago, and the obvious answer would have been Oriol Romeu. Ask me three years ago, the obvious answer would have been Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg.\nNowadays, Southampton have the youngest squad in the Premier League, making it difficult to yet envisage any of them becoming managers.\nJames Ward-Prowse leads through example and is football obsessed, so he would have the tools to grace the technical area. However, if you are looking for an all-shouting, all-pointing and somewhat curt figure, look no further than Jan Bednarek.\nThe rebuilding of Jan Bednarek has been one of the more pleasing aspects of Southampton's season.#SaintsFC pic.twitter.com/4zE0wWJzHj\n— Jacob Tanswell (@J_Tanswell) April 22, 2023\nHe enjoys analysing (often during games) and is always on hand to offer advice to head coach Ruben Selles on the touchline. Given Southampton’s travails this season, it has become commonplace for Bednarek to carry out his own personal investigation after a goal has been conceded while team-mates are caught in a thousand-yard stare.\nJacob Tanswell\nAdvertisement\nTottenham Hotspur\n“Pierre is very intelligent. He reads the game very well. He’s going to be a coach one day. He’s a pain, asking questions about why we do this and why we do that.”\nThat was the then-Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho speaking about Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg in 2020, articulating what many at the club felt and feel: Hojbjerg is a manager in waiting.\nHe has always positioned himself closely to his head coach — asking lots of questions, coming up with ideas — and he’s even perfected the art of giving terse post-match answers when interviewed.\nGO DEEPER\nHojbjerg: Tottenham's 'Viking' who divides opinion more than any other\nGiven his approach to the game, Hojbjerg would probably demand full commitment from his players while at the same time haranguing officials from the sidelines.\nI look forward to the year 2040 and reading a ChatGPT-generated long read on how the Hojbjerg Spurs era turned toxic.\nCharlie Eccleshare\nWest Ham United\nAngelo Ogbonna and Vladimir Coufal are the standout candidates.\nBoth are experienced and their leadership has helped ease West Ham’s relegation fears in recent weeks, but Ogbonna’s pedigree gives him the edge for a potential career in management.\nThe former Italy international has played under Alberto Zaccheroni, Giancarlo Camolese, Antonio Conte, David Moyes and Manuel Pellegrini. Camolese often had a tough-love approach with the defender at Torino, but Ogbonna was determined to impress him — so much so that he would stay behind after training to quiz his former manager over tactics.\nGO DEEPER\n‘Proper leader’ Angelo Ogbonna has found his inner Chiellini at West Ham\nAt Juventus, Angelo Alessio, Conte’s assistant coach, took a liking to the defender and challenged him to discover his inner Giorgio Chiellini.\nOgbonna never shies away from a challenge. He has all the key attributes to become a manager.\nRoshane Thomas\nWolverhampton Wanderers\nWolves have a quiet bunch of players, so there are not a host of standout candidates.\nAdvertisement\nRuben Neves has begun making notes this season, analysing his and Wolves’ performances. The captain is taking an interest in the wider picture, which might hint at managerial ambitions.\nAnd though he is yet to make a Wolves appearance, back-up goalkeeper Dan Bentley is a straight talker who is noted for his leadership qualities, so he could be a dark horse.\nBut the obvious answer is Joao Moutinho.\nGO DEEPER\nThe ultimate player's player, Moutinho brings class and leadership to every team he plays in\nHe is known at Wolves as a joker, so his persona might need a little makeover, but he is also a deep thinker about the game.\nThe 146-cap Portugal international has stated his ambition to become a boss, which is a headstart on most of his club colleagues.\nSteve Madeley\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Sam Richardson)",
