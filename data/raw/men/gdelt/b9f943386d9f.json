  "body_text": "Hearts travel to Bechem, Kotoko welcome Lions\nBy Jesse Otoo\nWeek four of the 2025/26 Ghana Premier League season kicks off this weekend with all clubs looking forward to securing the necessary results.\nThe first three weeks of the season have been filled with excitement and some shocking results. Some league heavyweights have suffered some lapses and would be looking forward to turning their fortunes around. The newly promoted sides are struggling to find their footing and will try to improve on their performances this weekend.\nBechem United welcome Hearts of Oak\nBechem United looks to clinch its first win of the season as it welcomes Heart of Oak on match day 4.\nBechem United hasn’t been impressive this season, although it’s just the early stages of the league. Something has to be done if they look to stay in the league. They have secured 1 point from the last 9 available. Scoring only a goal in three matches, it is clear Bechem United haven’t been lucky in front of goal.\nLosing away from home against Heart of Lions, Bechem United return home with the motive of reclaiming their lost pride.\nHearts is on an impressive run this season and would be looking forward to maintaining their remarkable form. Getting seven points from the last 9 games, the Phobians would be looking to bag another win tomorrow. Sitting third on the league table, Coach Didi Dramani and his boys would seek to give the fans the expected result.\nIn their last five meetings, Hearts have won 3 matches, with Bechem United winning 2. Nothing is assured going into this game, as the team that impresses could win.\nKotoko, Heart of Lions faceoff in Kumasi\nAsante Kotoko looks to rewrite history as they host Hearts of Lions at the Baba Yara Sports Stadium on match day 4 of the GPL.\nKotoko is sitting 11th on the league log with two outstanding matches, and would seek to clinch a win. They would be looking to follow their triumph in the CAF Confederations Cup against Kwara United from Nigeria, with another win this Sunday.\nCoach Abdul Karim Zito, after winning against Bibiani Gold Stars in the GHALCA top 4, said he does not lose to a team twice. Kotoko lost against Lions in their recent meeting. Coach Zito has a lot of work to do going into this match, as he would be looking forward to maintaining his record.\nHearts of Lions on the other hand have been nothing but impressive this season. They have secured 9 points from the last 9 available. Lions haven’t lost a match this season and would be looking forward to maintaining their dream start to the season. Ebenezer Abban is currently on top form and would be a threat to Kotoko, going into this game.\nThe last five meetings between these two sides have brought about some impressive outcomes. Lions have won 3 out of their last five meetings with Kotoko, with two matches ending in a draw.\nAlthough Hearts of Lions on paper looks like the favourite going into this match, Kotoko cannot be underestimated.\nMedeama host Nations\nMedeama looks to bounce back as it hosts Nations on the 4th match day of the season.\nComing from a one-nil away defeat to Karela, Medeama would be looking to get back to winning ways. Sitting 4th on the table and securing 6 points from the last 9, Medeama would seek a performance to please the fans. Medeama have been impressive in front of the goal this season. Scoring 6 and conceding 1, Medeama would look to score some more in this encounter.\nNations, on the other hand, sit 6th on the league log, having secured 4 points from the last 9. They drew in their last game against Samartex and would be seeking a win going into this match. Nations have scored twice and conceded twice.\nThe last five meetings between these two giants have resulted in some remarkable outcomes, with Medeama winning 4, Nations winning 1, and a match ending in a draw. Nations have had some defensive lapses and should improve upon them if they are to get something from this encounter.\nAll Blacks, Gold Stars fight for honours\nAccording to Ghana Football Association.com, Swedru All Blacks will be aiming to revive their Premier League campaign when they host defending champions Bibiani Gold Stars at the Swedru Sports Stadium on Saturday, October 4, 2025.\nConfidence remains in the All Blacks’ camp despite a heartbreaking 2-1 defeat to Aduana FC last weekend, which denied them back-to-back victories in the top flight. The last time the Swedru-based side managed successive league wins was during the 2008/09 season, when they stunned Hearts of Oak 3-1 before edging King Faisal 1-0.\nThis season, Ahmed Ibrahim Fathi’s side have found the net in all three of their league fixtures (W1, L2) but defensive frailties have cost them, conceding five goals in the process. However, their home form offers plenty of encouragement. The All Blacks have won their last three league matches at the Swedru Sports Stadium without conceding, including a commanding 3-0 victory over Berekum Chelsea on Matchday 2.\nBibiani Gold Stars return to domestic action following a bruising exit from the CAF Champions League, where they were eliminated by Algeria’s JS Kabylie with a 7-0 aggregate defeat. The reigning champions will now look to regroup and focus on defending their Premier League crown.\nThe Miners opened their 2025/26 campaign with a 2-1 victory over Bechem United at Dun’s Park and will be eager to claim their second successive league win. Gold Stars were formidable travellers last season, ranking as the third-best away side with six wins, five draws and six defeats. They head into Saturday’s fixture seeking a third consecutive away victory in the league, underlining their ability to perform on the road.\nFIXTURES\nFriday 3rd October\nBechem United15:00 Hearts\nSaturday 4th October\nSwedru All Blacks15:00 Gold Stars\nSunday 5th October\nKotoko 15:00 Heart of Lions\nBerekum Chelsea 15:00 Holy Stars\nDreams15:00 Vision FC\nEleven Wonders15:00 Young Apostles\nHohoe United15:00 Karela\nMedeama 15:00 Nations FC\nSamartex 15:00 Aduana\nFor more news, join The Chronicle Newspaper channel on WhatsApp: https://whatsapp.com/channel/",
