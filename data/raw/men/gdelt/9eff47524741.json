But Villa may have to sell before they can buy because they had a big spend in the last financial year,” the journalist said.\n“Champions League football will help, but it comes with squad bonuses and the need for depth. It comes with costs as well as a windfall, so Villa may not just be able to drop £60million or £65million on Olise.\n“It is an interesting one because there are a lot of clubs circling around Olise.”",
