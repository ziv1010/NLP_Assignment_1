I was never a bad companion for them and you can ask either Ake or Rico. I don’t have any superiority or inferiority complex towards them.\n“I think Manchester City were a bit ungrateful to me when they said that because I was a very important player in the years I was there. I never failed in my commitment to the club, to the fans. I always gave everything.”\nHe added: “I remember a time when I was robbed and attacked and the next day I was playing at the Emirates against Arsenal. These are things you don’t forget. I left my wife and daughter alone at home, terrified.\n“People will only remember this because Mr Guardiola has much more strength than me when he says something, and I prefer to keep to myself.”\nFast forward to the present and after 21 appearances for the German giants, the Bavarians decided against signing Cancelo permanently and now he is coming towards the end of a season-long loan at Barcelona.\nWhile the 29-year-old has expressed his joy at playing for the Catalan outfit, his performance in the 4-1 Champions League defeat to Paris Saint-Germain in midweek came under scrutiny, as did his display in the 3-2 loss to rivals Real Madrid on Sunday.\nGuardiola backed over Cancelo decision\nThat has promoted former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer to suggest Guardiola should feel vindicated for loaning out Cancelo, while implying he is not a team player.\nThe Dutchman told Ziggo Sport: “Now I know why Pep doesn’t like Cancelo. This guy plays his own football and thinks it’s only about what you do with the ball. You’re a defender!!!”\nDutch legend Marco van Basten was also frustrated with the City loanee, who he believes should have grown out of some of the negative tendencies he has been showing of late for Barca.\nHe added: “It’s crazy that Cancelo continues to repeat his mistakes at 29 years old.”\nDEEP DIVE: Man City considering shock Jack Grealish sale as ‘big fee’ paves way for £100m-plus replacement move\nThe former Valencia and Benfica man is still contracted to the Etihad until 2027 but it seems he may have played his last game for the club.\nReports suggest Barca are keen on retaining his services beyond this season and talks are ongoing to secure a deal. However, due to the Spanish side’s well-publicised financial struggles in recent years, there is no guarantee they will fork out a significant amount of money for the experienced campaigner – and may look for a cut-price deal.",
