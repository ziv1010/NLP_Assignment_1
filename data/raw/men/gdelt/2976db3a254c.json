  "body_text": "Aston Villa 1-0 Man City\nJust when the Champions thought it couldn’t get any worse, they lost the Manchester Derby in the most painful manner possible. Even if they had held on, that game was a tough watch and it’s strange to see such a successful team struggle to do the basics. I almost feel sorry for Pep Guardiola who clearly is not used to this feeling and doesn’t know how to react.\nThey will refind their confidence at some point, they just need to dig out that one win. Yet in their current form it’s no longer a shock if they lose at Villa Park.\nBrentford 3-1 Forest\nThe best home record in the division vs the surprise package of the season so far. Why the Bees have such contrasting forms on their travels is a debate for another day. On their own pitch they are a match for anyone.\nIpswich 1-1 Newcastle\nThe Toon have had a good week, but I still think they have a soft underbelly for this type of away day on a cold December weekend. It’s just if the home team can be clinical enough?\nThat’s why their late winner at Wolves was huge. Not just for the points but keeping the squad believing that they can be competitive at this level.\nWest Ham 0-2 Brighton\nI have decided that the Hammers might be the worst team to watch and easiest to play away from home. The trick is getting the first goal, and the London Stadium goes very quiet. Already a tricky atmosphere at the London Stadium, because fans are sat too far away, the brand of football is often too dull to lift the mood.\nPalace 1-1 Arsenal\nArsenal is capable of putting a run together but equally we will always have days like against Fulham and Everton where we suddenly pass the ball sideways and can’t break down a defence or our manager over complicates his tactics.\nWe are 6 points behind the Leaders who have a game in hand meaning we leave ourselves with little room for error. If you’re the side who struggles to make chances, then law of averages you’re going to have another off day. Selhurst Park under the floodlights is not easy.\nJust to clarify our second goal on Wednesday was offside. Some Gooners failed to mention that, like they conveniently didn’t talk about Martinelli escaping a second yellow card the week before. I thought there was an agenda against us.\nEverton 0-1 Chelsea\nIn his farewell letter to Evertonians Farhad Moshiri had the audacity to write that things may have been different had he hung on to Carlo Ancelotti. Even under the Italian they finished 12th!\nHe fails to mention how that would have changed how the club were run financially.\nThe new owners will witness the hard work they have to do, namely changing the playing style, which yet again will consist of this weekend of parking the bus. It worked against us but a chance to go top will be too big an incentive for the visitors.\nThey won’t be as slow as us or pass the ball sideways constantly. Chelsea can play a different squad in Europe so can focus solely on the Prem. They are contenders.\nFulham 3-1 Saints\nWhatever your opinion on Russel Martin, at least it should ensure the Saints don’t on Sunday try and pass out from the back, something that was costing them goals every week. Only Russel Martin knows if he was led to believe that he was there for the long term, and it was worth the lows now to make his squad better in the future? I just think no matter your ethos, you adapt if your principles are clearly not working.\nLeicester 2-1 Wolves\nGary O’Neil was always going to struggle to stay employed after losing at home to Ipswich. If you don’t know a lot about their new boss, he’s managed around the world, had success and is a student of the Johan Cruff and Pep Guardiola school book.\nYet I’m always unsure when a manager with zero knowledge of British Football moves to a relegation threatened side halfway through a season. The schedule means he will have little time on the training pitch to teach his ethos while I’m not such what finances will be available in January.\nIt’s the type of appointment you make in the summer with a whole preseason ahead.\nBased on that I think they had a better chance of survival sticking with O’Neil.\nI have more faith in Rudd Van Nistelrooy keeping the Foxes up.\nMan United 2-2 Cherries\nIf you can’t make the bench but Anthony can, then you have done something wrong. Rashford doesn’t even get called up by England anymore, yet look how much talk created by him being dropped while Garnacho’s omission has barely been mentioned. Imagine if United had lost the Derby?\nFor that reason, at 27, Rashford, for his own benefit, needs a fresh environment.\nBournemouth managed more shots on Monday night than in any game this season yet only managed one goal from a free kick. They will make chances at Old Trafford it’s just a case of will they convert them?\nSpurs 2-2 Liverpool\nIn Cup Football all that matters is the result and a Spurs fan isn’t going to complain about beating Man United to get to a major Semi Final (any anyone else fearing an Arsenal v Spurs Final?).\nYet at 3-0 up this was another game where Tottenham had a crazy period where they struggled to see out the match. Not just the mistakes from Forster but even their experienced players were giving the ball away.\nYou just can’t trust them to cope with Liverpool’s attack. Whether it’s the senior pros or the manager, they got to at times show game management. For example, don’t be passing the ball back to your keeper if he’s not good with his feet on Sunday, yet I bet Big Ange won’t change his tactics?\nFor better or worse you get entertainment at the Lane\nDAN\nAdeski 129\nNT Gunnerz 125\nTerrah 119\nAntivirus 117\nJRA 116\nBuchi 113\nGunnerstew 113\nStephanie 113\nQB 112\nAkeem 112\nOkobino107\nAyan 107\nSolwills 106\nWale A 105\nSagie 105\nBaron 104\nGB 104\nAckshay 103\nGuñnersmoke 103\nSue P 102\nMatthew 100\nKenya 100\nJ Gunner 98\nNOAS 95\nDendrite 94\nYayo 94\nPrince 92\nMe 91\nTom 90\nDrayton 89\nMTG 88\nEdu 87\nAchizzy 84\nEJS 84\nJS7RG 80\nO Achiel 80\nTop 36 Qualify for Champions League\nZeekseeso 77\nAmir 75\nI 75\nAdmin 69\nBang bang 65\nJ Bauer 65\nJ gunz 64\nJ legend 63\nDragon 62\nSplendid 62\nBig slim 58\nBabalosa 54\nTaiwo 52\nLereng Jacob 49\nBa Thea 46\nLupilu 45\nWilliamrick 43\nFamochi 43\nIlliterate 37\nOluseyi 20- 36\nOlushorlar 36\nRich Royal 35\nBertie 33\nDan kit 30\nLabass 27\nTeteu 26\nGabriel 24\nIGL 22\nKobin 18\nLovely 17\nElvis 16\nSWS 16 to\nRalph 15\nOslogunner 65-12\nBarry 11\nIsaac 11\nAlex 9\nMulu Fidel 9\nGunner 4 life 8\nDotash 7\nE Augustus 7\nTerry 5\nDunchirado 5\nAlwattan 3\nADMIN COMMENT\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans.
