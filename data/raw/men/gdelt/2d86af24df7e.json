So keep an eye on Premier League clubs and Rodrygo.”\nLatest Arsenal news: Andrey Santos blow, Gordon fee\nArsenal have received a blow in their pursuit of Andrey Santos in the summer transfer window.\nThe Gunners want to sign the Chelsea-owned star, but Todd Boehly’s comments cast a double on a potential deal.\nArsenal are in danger of missing out on one of their top targets to Real Madrid, according to a report.\nThe north London club are keen on the winger, but Los Blancos have now taken a shine to him.\nMeanwhile, Arsenal have been told how much they need to pay to sign Anthony Gordon from Premier League rivals Newcastle United.",
