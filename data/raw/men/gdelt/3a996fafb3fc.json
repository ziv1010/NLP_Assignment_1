He needs to do it – with us or another place.\n‘It’s a question for Jack, his agent, and the club. If he stays it will be fine and he fought like he fought from day one to make a contribution.’\nWith several clubs circling ahead of the transfer window, the Telegraph reports that Grealish will not be in City’s squad for the Club World Cup in what is perhaps the clearest indication yet that his future lies away from the Etihad.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nThe decision is said to have been made to allow Grealish the best opportunity to find a new club ahead of next season.\nSecuring a transfer away from Manchester may prove difficult given his £300,000-a-week wages, and an initial loan deal could well be on the cards.\nPerhaps hoping to take advantage of that loan opportunity could be Everton, who have been installed as the bookies favourites to sign Grealish.\nThe Toffees enjoyed a resurgent second half of the season under David Moyes and will look to kick on next campaign as they move into their new stadium.\nAntonio Conte’s side could be in the market for a new left-sided attacker after selling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to PSG in January and Italy has proven a great place for ex-Premier League stars to find another lease of life.\nJack Grealish next club odds\nEverton – 7/2\nTottenham – 4/1\nNapoli – 9/2\nNewcastle 5/1\nAston Villa – 6/1\nAC Milan – 13/2\nAny Saudi Pro League club – 16/1\nNottingham Forest – 16/1\nOdds courtesy of Bet365 (subject to change)\nGrealish need only look at how Scott McTominay has blossomed since joining Napoli from Manchester United last summer, with the Scotland midfielder recently named Serie A MVP.\nTottenham and Newcastle have also been touted as favourites to make a move for Grealish as both sides look to fill out their squads ahead of a return to the Champions League.\nMore Trending\nAnd a return to Aston Villa could also be on the cards, with Grealish’s former club priced at 6/1 to make a swoop for their former star.\nWherever he may end up, Alan Shearer believes it is imperative that Grealish departs the Etihad as soon as possible, saying after the FA Cup final: ‘His time is up at Man City. He has to leave.\n‘For Pep Guardiola to bring on a debutant, a young boy, and [Ilkay] Gundogan rather than Jack Grealish when Man City are desperate for a goal… his time is up.\n‘He’s done at Man City, he has to leave. For whatever reason Pep is done with him, he doesn’t like him. His time is up, it really is.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Rasmus Hojlund responds to Inter offer after breakthrough talks to leave Man Utd\nMORE: Arsenal ‘very close’ to signing Konstantinos Karetsas in £37.8m transfer\nMORE: Ayden Heaven finally explains why he left Arsenal to join Manchester United",
