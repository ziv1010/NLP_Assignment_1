  "body_text": "Injuries, fixtures worry Pasuwa\nFCB Nyasa Bullets say the team’s crammed diary is a cause for concern as they try to navigate both domestic and international fixtures amid injuries to eight of their key players.\nThe People’s Team are expected to play three domestic fixtures within six days before they travel to Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) for the CAF Champions League second preliminary round reverse fixture against TP Mazembe on September 30.\nThe TNM Super League champions face Mighty Waka Waka Tigers tomorrow in a league match before switching their attention to Sunday’s FDH Bank Cup semi-final fixture against Dedza Dynamos Salima Sugar.\nNext Wednesday, just three days before they take on Mazembe, they are scheduled to face Bangwe All Stars.\nBullets have a number of players on injury list, the latest being left-back Precious Sambani, who sustained a knee injury during Sunday’s match against TP Mazembe.\nOthers are Stanley Billiat, Peter Banda, Gasten Phodo, Alick Lungu and Mike Mkwate.\nSaid Pasuwa: “The fixtures are coming thick and thin and it is a concern, but we’ll just have to manage the situation.\n“Injuries are also one of the things affecting us a lot. [For instance], Gomezgani [Chirwa] played as a centre-back instead of his usual right-back position.\n“And then Sambani has a knee problem and this weekend, he won’t play.”\nBullets chief administration officer Albert Chigoga said: “The injuries are indeed affecting the coach’s plans as well as weakening the team balance as he is forced to makeshift his tactical formation in such important games.\n“Locally, fixtures have been deferred severally to enable us play CAF Champions League games, both league and cup games. Our next game is up against Tigers in the Super League, then the next game is the FDH Bank cup semi-final against Dedza Dynamos.\n“So, it is indeed a tricky and sticky situation at the same time. We will see what is the best for us in domestic football as well as in the Champions League. We will see about it.”\nOn the possibility of shifting Bullets’ fixture against Bangwe, Super League of Malawi general secretary said: “We will wait for the itinerary from Nyasa Bullets for us to consider the schedule accordingly.”",
