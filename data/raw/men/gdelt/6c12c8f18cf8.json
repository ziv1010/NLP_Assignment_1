  "body_text": "Two draws, two games without a goal from open play and 11th in Ligue 1 is not what most would have predicted for the start of the Luis Enrique era at Paris Saint-Germain.\nPatience is rarely preached in Paris but this summer there has been a lot of change, and transition is expected. The club have signed 10 players, and they have waved goodbye to Neymar and Lionel Messi.\nAdvertisement\nIn personnel alone, PSG look very different and tactically too, there are signs of a big expected shift under their new coach. “We can’t wait to grow the project,” Luis Enrique said on Wednesday. “For that, we need more time, for the team to understand what we want as coaches.”\nIn the meantime, then, as PSG adapt to life as a club eager to put the institution above player power, does an opportunity present itself for the chasing pack?\nFinancially, the answer should be a resounding no. PSG’s investments dwarf the rest of the division — the French champions have invested more than €200million (£171m, $216m) this summer, with Lens and Marseille some way back, on around €60million. Their payrolls do not come close either. According to published accounts for the 2021-22 season, PSG are (now reducing) the largest payroll in football (more than €700m), while Marseille that year did not surpass €150m.\nLens showed what is possible last year if a club is run smartly and with the right combination of sound management, strong recruitment and excellent coaching. They took a mid-table budget and turned it into 84 points, one shy of a PSG side with Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe in attack.\nThis weekend, last season’s top two meet again at the Parc des Princes. After last year, you would assume Lens would be best placed to take advantage of any teething issues in Paris but they too have undergone a summer of change.\nTheir two key stars, midfielder Seko Fofana and striker Lois Openda, have departed for Al Nassr and RB Leipzig. The club have been in this situation before. Last summer, they lost loanee Arnaud Kalimuendo, who returned to PSG to join Rennes, but replaced him with Openda who went on to break their club record for goals in a season. Losing Fofana is a major test as he had a huge influence on their growth since their return to the top tier in 2020.\nAdvertisement\nThe assumption is that coach Franck Haise will not be able to repeat the trick of last season, particularly with Champions League football to consider. The jury remains out on how they cope in their first summer without sporting director Florent Ghisolfi, who joined Nice last October. But after an opening-day defeat by Brest, and then a draw against Rennes, they are steadying the ship.\nAndy Diouf, the 23-year-old signed from Basel after a loan from Rennes, looks smart business as they seek to reinforce midfield. Importantly, they have now also found a replacement for €43m record sale Openda. Twenty-year-old Elye Wahi, signed from Montpellier over the weekend for a reported €30m, scored 17 goals and provided six assists last season. With the rest of the squad intact and goalkeeper Brice Samba, now the No 2 for France, and defender Kevin Danso signing new contracts, there is potential for another good season, even if a title tilt is beyond them. “I rarely say that I am satisfied,” Haise said last weekend. “But I am very happy to have him in our workforce.”\nGiven Lens’ air of uncertainty, most assumed Marseille might be in a strong position to push PSG. They have bid farewell to high-press priest Igor Tudor, and replaced him with former Athletic Bilbao, Villarreal and Valencia coach Marcelino. Their squad will have a different look too, especially in attack. Alexis Sanchez and club legend Dimitri Payet have departed and in have come Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Ismaila Sarr and Iliman N’Diaye.\nIt is a promising and flair-fuelled front line but, like PSG, they have not got off to a fast start. They suffered a shock Champions League exit in their qualifier with Panathinaikos, conceding late in normal time in the second leg to draw 2-2, and then losing on penalties. Their exit felt symptomatic of French stage fright in Europe, a particular blow with the French coefficient increasingly precarious amid Dutch competition.\nBut they are adjusting from Tudor’s high-octane press to something more structured under Marcelino. That may take time and while they drew with Metz last weekend, they still had 22 attempts and hit the woodwork three times. They have lofty ambitions. “It is too early to know who is the favourite in Ligue 1, even if PSG are the main candidate because they have the biggest budget,” said Marcelino this month. “We want to fight to be at the top of the rankings.”\nAdvertisement\nMonaco are the other squad with a large wage bill, but you never quite know what you will get with them. Young talent has been plucked away, such as defender Axel Disasi, who followed Benoit Badiashile to Chelsea, while forward Kevin Volland, 31, has also left for Union Berlin. But they have started well under new coach Adi Hutter, with back-to-back wins in their opening matches, and are close to an agreement with Arsenal to sign USMNT international Folarin Balogun on a permanent deal.\nTakumi Minamino, signed from Liverpool, underwhelmed in his first season but has started this one promisingly, now that he is working with the same coach he thrived under in Salzburg.\nHe scored twice in their 3-0 victory over Strasbourg last weekend. Monaco have a good squad across the board, with Aleksandr Golovin (eight goals, seven assists last year) adding creativity and Youssouf Fofana and Mohamed Camara forming an impressive combination in midfield, reinforced now by the arrival of Denis Zakaria from Juventus.\nThey had a poor defensive record last season, conceding 58 goals, but Mohammed Salisu (Southampton) and Wilfried Singo (Torino) have arrived and they have recruited a new goalkeeper in Philipp Kohn from Salzburg. There are question marks, though, with forward Breel Embolo suffering an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and Wissam Ben Yedder, a reliable goalscorer, recently indicted for rape, a charge he denies. If they can improve defensively and bolster their depth, then they should improve on last year’s sixth place.\nOf the outside challengers, Rennes seem the best placed to move into contention. Backed by billionaire Francois Pinault, Rennes have consistently built good squads in recent years that have secured regular European qualification, but have not punched particularly high. That might change this year, though. They have made a habit of recruiting well with young, often French talent, and while they have continued that with 23-year-old Enzo Le Fee joining from Lorient, a coup considering the interest, they have added players based on their ability now, such as Ludovic Blas, 25 from Nantes, and experience in Nemanja Matic, 35, a change in terms of profile of signing.\nTheir squad is a good one, with Arnaud Kalimuendo and Amine Gouiri in attack, the promising Desire Doue emerging in midfield (and his brother Guela in defence) alongside the reliable Benjamin Bourigeaud and Arthur Theate leading their defence. But they have been subject to Premier League poaching, with Chelsea nabbing Lesley Ugochukwu and Manchester City set to claim dribble king Jeremy Doku. That could hurt them, but with winger Martin Terrier returning from an ACL injury in the coming weeks, that may lessen the blow. Rennes want Champions League football and, considering their squad, they should be aiming for it.\nLille will have similar ambitions, although much is dependent on their retention of Jonathan David. The Canada international scored 24 goals last season, pushing Mbappe for the Golden Boot, and most expected he would be plucked away. However, that has not come to pass. Paulo Fonseca has implemented a pleasing style of play and they are an intriguing watch. They have an exciting young goalkeeper in Lucas Chevalier, 21, who made his mark last year and was France’s No 1 for the Under-21 European Championship in the summer, as well as Angel Gomes, who impressed with England at that tournament. He runs the show in midfield alongside the experienced Benjamin Andre. They finished fifth last season, and they could improve on that.\nAdvertisement\nThe rest are a long way off. Nice are entering a new era after a disappointing ninth place last season. There seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel with Ghisolfi’s arrival but he has asked that fans reset expectations at the INEOS-owned club. They have appointed Roberto De Zerbi’s former Benevento and Sassuolo understudy Francesco Farioli as their head coach. “When you talk with supporters, they do not care about PSG,” Ghisolfi told L’Equipe. “They want a coherent project, people that work hard, players who respect the club and who play together.”\nStrasbourg have had a big change since their takeover by Chelsea’s owners, the Boehly-Clearlake group. They have spent €30m and appointed Patrick Vieira, but progress may take time. They won their opening game of the season but were then outplayed against Monaco last weekend.\nLyon are now also American-owned after John Textor’s Eagle Football group took full control, with Textor replacing Jean-Michel Aulas as president. However, they are already in crisis. A summer of off-field issues with the French Financial Regulator (DNCG) has spilt into the new season. Back-to-back defeats, including a 4-1 home defeat by Montpellier on Saturday, means they have lost six on the spin including pre-season games and coach Laurent Blanc’s solution to their issues this weekend was to say, to the media, that the team should “change the manager”.\nPSG’s quality in their squad means that any challenger is going to have to go above and beyond to pip them to the title. And even then, as Lens illustrated last year, it still might not be enough.\n(Main image: Aubameyang of Marseille, Lens goalkeeper Samba and Golovin of Monaco. Photos: Getty Images)",
