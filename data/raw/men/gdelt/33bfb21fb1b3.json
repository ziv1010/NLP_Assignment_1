And I was like \"what?\" It just finished like that without even giving us a warning. There was no kind of like \"oh we're not gonna do [a] next series' or anything.\"\n'[So I found out] on a plane back from holiday. I think it might have been the beginning of 2000 or the end of 1999 but it was after we did our last show. And Ulrika [just said on holiday] \"oh just to let you know we're unemployed.\"'\nBradford-born Jennifer represented Britain in international athletics for over a decade. She bagged a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in 1990 and a bronze at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics for the 4x400m relay.\nHowever, in 1993 a serious hamstring injury halted her blossoming sports career for two years. She decided to join Gladiators in 1996 as Rebel - although she continued with athletics, recording a personal best time for the 200m.\nRebel excelled in all events, especially Powerball, Pendulum and The Wall, in which she was only beaten once. After quitting the show in 1999, the 50-year-old appeared in the Ridley Scott blockbuster movie Gladiator.\nMother-of-two Jennifer is still heavily involved with track and field events, and she runs a successful sports management company.\nIt comes after Gladiators made its long-awaited return to screens on January 13 after 25 years, with a whole new cast set to do battle in the iconic arena.\nThe popular game show, which was originally broadcasted on ITV from 1992 to 2000, sees contestants battle highly trained athletes called 'gladiators' in gruelling physical challenges.\nJennifer was left devastated when pal Ulrika Jonsson, who hosted the series, told her that Gladiators was ending on the plane back from Mauritius together\nThe original cast in 1998 (Back row - left to right: Warrior, Raider, Hunter, Saracen, Trojan.
