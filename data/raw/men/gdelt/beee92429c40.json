  "body_text": "Former Premier League striker Ian Wright has backed Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford to complete a shock summer move to Newcastle.\nRashford’s future is uncertain as the transfer window approaches. He joined Aston Villa on loan in January after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim, who regularly left him out of matchday squads, citing training and selection reasons.\nAmorim revealed that he could not get Rashford to train or play football the way he wanted, hence he sanctioned a temporary move to Villa. The England international has looked rejuvenated at Villa, notching a decent four goals and six assists in seven games across all competitions.\nVilla have the option of making his signing a permanent one for £40million but it’s currently unclear whether or not they will do so.\nA recent report covered by The Peoples Person relayed that Rashford hasn’t entirely closed the door on a return to United, despite ongoing tension with Amorim.\nIt was stated that the 27-year-old also wants Champions League football, which may rule out Villa if they fail to qualify for the competition through a top-five league finish. Additionally, Rashford is not interested in switching to London clubs, amidst links to Crystal Palace and Tottenham Hotspur.\nNow, Ian Wright has suggested a shocking new transfer destination for the Carrington academy graduate – Newcastle.\nSpeaking on his Ringer FC podcast, after it was the possibility of a Rashford move to Tyneside was put to him, Wright remarked, “It’s the kind of signing Newcastle should be making.”\n“That would be amazing. That would be dangerous. Rashford at Newcastle? Yeah.”\n“That would be really good. I really like that for Rashford. Rashford at Newcastle can be dangerous.”\nAsked whether Rashford could go back to United, Wright answered, “Nope. No chance.”\nRashford has three years left on his contract with United.\nFeatured image Mike Hewitt via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
