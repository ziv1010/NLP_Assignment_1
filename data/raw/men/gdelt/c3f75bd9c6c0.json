The line includes two designs, the Flight of CR7 and the Heart of CR7, created to highlight Ronaldo's personality and ever-growing brand.\nThe Flight of CR7 features Ronaldo's iconic goal for Real Madrid back in March 2013, scored to secure victory over his former side Man Utd in the Champions League. The watch face showcases the player in his number seven shirt, preparing to header the ball into the back of the net.\nHis second of the collection, the Heart of CR7, captures the moment just after that goal, showing Ronaldo celebrating after granting his side victory.\nBoth pieces are designed with luxury in mind, utilising unique detail to create esteemed wristwear worn by the likes of Ronaldo himself.\nTaking to social media to celebrate the launch of his new collection, Ronaldo said: \"I've always dreamed of having my own watch collection. The Jacob & Co Flight of CR7 and the Heart of CR7 takes inspiration from some of my most iconic moments on the field. I hope you like them as much as I do.\"\nJacob & Co revealed their motivation behind the collection, saying: \"All those who admire, love and are inspired by the achievements of Cristiano Ronaldo will appreciate the creation. The symbols, the care and the level of craftsmanship are worthy of Jacob & Co's exclusivity and CR7's fame.\"\nRonaldo has continued to build his personal brand off the field, launching his very own YouTube channel earlier this year that has already accumulated 64m followers.",
