  "body_text": "By Web Desk\nApril 26, 2024\nBayern Munich's preparations for the upcoming Champions League semi-final first leg against Real Madrid are not affected by the search for coach Thomas Tuchel's replacement, the German tactician said on Friday.\nBayern, who will lock horns with Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday with the league title already clinched by Bayer Leverkusen, will say goodbye to Tuchel at the end of the season after failing to impress domestically. He had a year left on his contract with the German giants.\nSeveral coaches have been linked with the club including Austria coach Ralf Rangnick.\n\"In the next 11 days it can only be football and the goals we can still reach,\" Tuchel told a press conference. \"We want to collect points (in the Bundesliga) to get the best result and reach the Champions League final.\n\"For anything else there is just no capacity at the moment, whether it is comfortable or uncomfortable despite the many issues.\"\nTuchel also highlighted the importance of the match against Madrid bearing in mind the fact that there is no chance of any winning any silverware in the domestic season.\n\"I can accept and it is important that we all accept it that there is this background noise against Frankfurt,\" Tuchel said. \"We don't have to tell ourselves a fairytale that we are only thinking 100% about Eintracht.\n\"There is this background noise that the Real Madrid game plays a role. When I get my coffee in the morning people don't say 'good luck for tomorrow' they say 'good luck for Tuesday,'\" he added.\nDayot Upamecano is doubtful after twisting an ankle in training and Leroy Sane is in a race against time to get fit for Tuesday.\n\"But tomorrow we have a test (against Frankfurt) and either we are distracted or we find solutions. Put on ear plugs or headphones and study for the test. That is my task,\" said Tuchel.",
