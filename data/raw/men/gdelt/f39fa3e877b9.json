Nick Pope was injured at the end of that Man U match and United ended up with only three points from those next five games, which on paper was a generous schedule, with the fixture list having front loaded so many tough matches.\nBy the time Nick Pope got injured, it was the culmination of a horrendous period of over two months when the list of missing players had made things all but impossible. Pope’s injury clearly tipped us off the cliff and that has basically continued for another four months AND still continues. Eddie Howe missing at least an entire team of first team squad players for this Fulham match, as was the case against Everton on Tuesday.\nSo I want you to consider three scenarios.\nNewcastle United averaging around 9 or 10 (or more!) missing players these past six months, averaging 6 or 7, averaging 3 or 4.\nNewcastle United averaging 9 or 1o missing:\nThis is what the reality has been, absolutely unprecedented number of missing players, week after week, month after month. Newcastle United eighth in the table with 44 points.\nNewcastle United averaging 6 or 7 missing:\nI honestly think that with even 6 or 7 players regularly missing, which is beyond what pretty much any other rival club has experienced this season, Eddie Howe would still have had Newcastle United up around where Villa and Spurs are, so somewhere between fourth and sixth but definitely with similar number of points, around 56-59, not 44.\nAfter all, despite having had a terrible situation with injuries in October and November, Eddie Howe still had NUFC after 14 games, just one point behind Spurs and three behind Villa.\nEven if Newcastle had just kept up their points average per game from those opening 14 PL matches, it would have meant now NUFC on 56 points after 30 PL games.\nNewcastle United averaging 3 or 4 missing:\nThis is kind of a normal situation, having three or four missing at any one time at the most.\nIf Eddie Howe had experienced this kind of normal luck, as he did the previous season when with a weaker squad than now, Newcastle United ended up fourth…\nWell, in my opinion, Newcastle United would have been fourth as a minimum now. How close they would have got to bothering those top three… who knows?\nThe truth is though, that no honest person would say Eddie Howe and his squad have had ‘normal’ luck this season with players available. Which means you do have to also accept that it is unrealistic to think Newcastle United have gained anything like the number of points they would have done, if having just bad luck, never mind fair luck!\nIt isn’t a case of blaming every performance and every result (when Newcastle haven’t won) on the horrendous number of missing players this season. However, it is a case of saying that you have to accept that overall, the unprecedented number of unavailable players made it impossible to get close to where they would have been without that horrific luck.\nAlso worth pointing out, that in early December, Newcastle United were in the quarter-finals of the League Cup and facing the final Champions League group game. Even with having double figures of missing players, Eddie Howe’s side came within a couple of minutes of reaching a semi-final against Middlesbrough and also minutes away from reaching the last 16 of the Champions League (which they would have done anyway, if not cheated by that ridiculous penalty in Paris).\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
