  "body_text": "Lionel Messi is looking back at his time with FC Barcelona. The fan-favorite athlete, who is now enjoying his new life chapter in Miami with his wife Antonela Roccuzzo and his kids, started his journey with the team at the young age of 13, made his competitive debut at age 17, and departed at 34.\nDuring his latest interview with Mundo Deportivo, the soccer star shared his thoughts about an important stage of his life, as the club celebrates its 125th anniversary. \"The first thing that comes to mind is the countless beautiful memories from all the time I spent at the best club in the world. What I remember most are the collective titles we won, like the year of the Sextuple,\" he said to the publication.\n\"This is a club that’s always stood out for having the best players and coaches in the world,\" Messi said before highlighting important figures in the team. “Football legends have always wanted to come to Barça: from Johan Cruyff to Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi, both Luis Suárezes, Hristo (Stoichkov), Pep Guardiola (as both player and coach), Ronnie (Ronaldinho), Rijkaard (who I’ll include for what he meant to me and the club), Diego Maradona, who, despite being here briefly, made a massive impact, and Koeman with his goal at Wembley in the first European Cup win.”\nMessi revealed that he was influenced by two important figures. “I’d say two figures influenced me the most, for different reasons. Pep, because he was my coach for so many years, and we achieved incredible things that we never thought possible,\" he continued. “And Ronaldinho, for the way he welcomed me and helped me so much when I first joined the senior team.”\n“I’d love to see Barça winning La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the Champions League again. And in the years when that’s not possible, at least fighting until the last moment,\" he declared, adding that he misses them \"so much, and I hope we can see each other again soon. They should feel proud to be part of the best club in the world.”",
