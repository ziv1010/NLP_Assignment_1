  "body_text": "You might have thought that the best part of Chelsea’s delightful 6-2 win over Wolves was Noni Madueke’s hat-trick or Cole Palmer’s hat-trick of assists or Nicolas Jackson’s overall excellence and industry, but for Enzo Maresca, it was more about the collective rather than any of the individual parts.\nEnzo Maresca delighted with ‘the right mentality’ shown by Chelsea against Wolves\nPost-match reaction from the boss\nSpecifically, the head coach highlighted the team’s mentality, especially in responding to a first half that featured several self-inflicted wounds once again.\n“In the first-half, we started the first 10 or 15 minutes very good [but] then we started to lose easy balls, conceding set-pieces, lose confidence — and this already happened the other day against Servette. [At half-time I said] to play in the way we want to play; we need to be a little bit more accurate. We can lose the ball if they press us very intense but we cannot lose the ball just giving away for the wrong decision. The difference between the first and second halves was about being more accurate.”\n“[And] the best thing today from Noni was not his hat-trick but the way he defended. 90 minutes, that showed the right mentality that I’m demanding from the players. [...] If we want to build something important; then first of all we need the right mentality and that was very good. [...] Hopefully we can build some momentum from there and to continue to improve.”\n“I want to see my team playing the way we want to play. Compete every game; this is the most important thing. On the ball, to have a clear idea of what we want. Off the ball, to be a very aggressive team. In some moments today, we started to see our team in terms of our pressing.\n“[We] will see where we arrive but the most important thing is to be better game after game. [We] can build something important through time, a month, a year, and then we can arrive to compete for [the Premier League and Champions League].”\n-Enzo Maresca; source: Football.London\nThis result could turn out to be a statement game, or it could prove to be a flash in the pan like so many other good results over the past couple years. The difference is how we build from there, and if we can build from here.\nWe have a week to go in the transfer window and two games left in that week before the first international break. Good chance to build some early momentum.",
