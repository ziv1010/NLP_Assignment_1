I didn't have any German coaches, I had Dutch, Italian, Brazilian...nationality doesn't matter,\" he said. \"It does matter that they know the football of other countries and has trained in other places. Quality, ambition also matters...there is no robot portrait.\"\nWhile this could prove damaging to Flick's hopes of securing the Barcelona job, it stands to boost the chances of Brighton & Hove Albion's Roberto De Zerbi and outgoing Bayern head coach Thomas Tuchel.\nDe Zerbi has proven hugely successful in the Premier League having previously managed in Italy and Ukraine, while Tuchel has won honours in Germany, France and England.",
