Despite that, he could fetch a hefty transfer fee, and if a side is willing to pay for him then it would make sense to sell the Brazilian and reinvest that money in the squad.\nMore Tottenham stories\nHarry Kane has been tipped to return to London – but not with Spurs. The all-time leading Lilywhites scorer is having his best-ever season at Bayern.\nOne 'ridiculous' deal is close, while 'the next Mohamed Salah' has been tipped, too. Anthony Martial has been linked, as has one versatile star.\nRyan is a staff writer for FourFourTwo, joining the team full-time in October 2022.
