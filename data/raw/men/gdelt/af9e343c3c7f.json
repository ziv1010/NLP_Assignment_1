  "body_text": "Chelsea are understood to lead Liverpool in the race for Hugo Ekitike this summer.\nBoth Premier League outfits are in desperate need of an offensive rehaul this summer. The centre-forward position, in particular, is a key area in this regard.\nWhilst Christopher Nkunku’s average numbers have been far from disappointing, the Blues appear to have every intention of parting with the 27-year-old.\nIn which case, one of Europe’s most exciting young attackers in Ekitike could represent a wise investment.\nChelsea ahead of Liverpool for Hugo Ekitike\nLiverpool, in fairness, have overcome steep odds quite recently in their battle with German giants Bayern for Florian Wirtz.\nMore to the point, it seems the Reds won’t baulk at Eintracht Frankfurt’s reported €100m [£84m] price tag. That’s despite being prepared to fork out in excess of £100m for Bayer Leverkusen’s generational talent.\nBut for the time being, Christian Falk reports that Chelsea are in talks to sign Ekitike, and are firmly in the lead for that matter.\nChelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal were previously considered the top favourites for Hugo Ekitiké. But the three-man competition has now turned into a two-club battle,” the BILD reporter exclusively informed CaughtOffside.\n“At the moment, Chelsea, who qualified for the Champions League in fourth place, hold the best cards in the Ekitiké poker. Chelsea are already in dialogue with the player’s side and could soon get serious.\n“But Liverpool are also still in the race, despite the upcoming record transfer of Florian Wirtz.”\nDarwin Nunez is yesterday’s news\nIt’s worth bearing in mind that the Reds’ needs are arguably far greater than their Premier League rivals when it comes to the striking department.\nWhen it comes down to the numbers, Nkunku actually hasn’t had a terrible season for Enzo Maresca’s men\nOf course, Chelsea will, quite reasonably argue that only three league goals in 2024/25 (with five coming in the UEFA Conference League) is an abysmal record. Mind, Darwin Nunez’s record isn’t much better with five Premier League goals this term.\n* Goal contributions in all competitions in the 2024/25 season\nLikewise, Liverpool will be keenly aware of the fact that they’ve relied on the wings (and, in particular, Mo Salah) to stump up the majority of their goals in a title-winning campaign.\nThere is an urgent need for threat down the middle, which Hugo Ekitike looks able to provide. Certainly, a rate of a goal contribution every 107.20 minutes (from 34 goal contributions in 48 games) is an eye-catching statistic in Bundesliga football.\nThe big question is whether this rate can neatly translate to life in the Premier League. Not to mention whether or not Liverpool are prepared to stick it out in the hopes of picking up a stronger hand.\nThey may be coming up against the champions, but Chelsea can still point to their Champions League qualification in their bid to secure Ekitike’s signature.",
