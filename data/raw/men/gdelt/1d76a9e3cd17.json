  "body_text": "Close followers of the USWNT were generally pessimistic about their chances at this Women’s World Cup, but the scale of their underperformance in the group stage was quite striking. The 3-0 win over Vietnam wasn’t as easy as anticipated, while the games against the Netherlands and Portugal have brought two draws, 1-1 and 0-0.\nAdvertisement\nSlip-ups happen, even for the serious contenders to win this competition. Germany lost to Colombia, France couldn’t beat Jamaica. Australia and England needed a penalty to defeat Ireland and Haiti respectively. But the U.S. performances have been more troubling than the results. It’s partly about individuals. But it’s also about identity.\nThe first issue is the U.S. no longer have a dominant collection of individuals, unlike when they won the previous two tournaments. Coming into this World Cup, it felt probable that western Europe had caught up in that respect, but on the strength of the group stage, it seems nations from across the globe have too.\nThe U.S. are (probably) between two generations of great players. This can happen. The 2015/2019 generation was genuinely special. Of that group, some dependable players have retired. Some are injured. Some weren’t selected. Some are still around, but are evidently past their best.\nThere is no questioning the talent of Naomi Girma, Alyssa Thompson, Sophia Smith or Trinity Rodman, all 23 or under and the start of the next U.S. generation. But these players are all competing at their first World Cup, have little experience playing outside their home country and simply aren’t at the age where footballers usually peak.\nAt the moment, you can reasonably put together a World Best XI without a single USWNT player, for probably the first time since the Women’s World Cup was created in 1991. That doesn’t mean the U.S. can’t win the tournament, but it does mean they have to play more collectively.\nThat brings us to the second issue: the absence of tactical intelligence from Vlatko Andonovski’s side. There is simply no cohesion in what the U.S. are attempting, with or without possession. Leaving aside the win over Vietnam, where anything other than a comfortable victory would have been an astonishing shock, they have been ill-equipped to cope with the opposition’s system.\nAdvertisement\nIn fairness, the Netherlands opened the scoring against the run of play, but thereafter they kept the ball expertly, moving it patiently around the defence while the U.S. looked utterly confused about how they might go about pressing the opposition back three.\nPortugal, meanwhile, used a diamond midfield, which allowed them to cut through the U.S. lines smoothly. One particular move, which put in Jessica Silva for a good goalscoring opportunity, was particularly rare at this World Cup as an example of a team progressing the ball directly through the centre.\nIt’s not that other teams don’t want to do that, of course, more that their opponents have defended in a compact block, forcing attacks down the flanks. Not the U.S.; there are simply too many gaps between the lines.\nTheir attacking game has been largely based around getting the ball out wide to Smith and Rodman or Thompson, and expecting them to thrive in one-against-one situations. It worked against Vietnam but, to be frank, it hasn’t worked against defenders who are actually professional footballers.\nThere is a lack of genuine creativity and incision in this side. The best moments of interplay have come when Alex Morgan has dropped deep and flicked the ball around the corner to the wingers. But against Portugal, Morgan — probably troubled by her lack of goals in this competition — was too individualistic and shot in situations when she could have passed, like this difficult attempt when Rose Lavelle was screaming for the ball on the edge of the box.\nMorgan has no goals from 13 attempts at World Cup 2023. Damningly, just one has been on target. Even more damningly, that was a penalty, which was saved.\nThe third issue is something deeper: it’s about philosophy. In truth, despite their previous successes, this has never been an area of strength for the USWNT; there’s always been a question mark about precisely what type of football they offer. The strengths of previous U.S. sides have been mental resilience, fitness levels and belief. These are all general concepts which could apply to any sport.\nAdvertisement\nBut what is the footballing identity of a U.S. side? Are they about long, patient spells of possession? No. Are they astute counter-pressers who set up traps and then pounce quickly? To a certain extent, because of fitness levels, but this has generally been about energy rather than intelligence. Do they rotate positions to drag opponents apart? Not noticeably. Do they switch formation to exploit opposition weaknesses? Probably to a lesser extent than other contenders to win World Cups.\nThe man who coached the U.S. to their first Women’s World Cup triumph, Anson Dorrance in 1991, once explained the footballing style of the side. “What we had an opportunity to do, which was unique, was developing our game within the sort of cultural and athletic mores of the United States,” he said, quoted in Kieran Theivam and Jeff Kassouf’s book, The Making of the Women’s World Cup. “I was coaching entirely within the parameters of our own culture. Because we had no (footballing) culture, we couldn’t pride ourselves on our sophistication or our creativity. But we had this relentless, irrepressible American spirit with a confidence that belied our capability.”\nThat approach persists today. In footballing terms, that approach comes down to a couple of concepts: one-against-one dribbling out wide, and hard running from midfield. This works when you are superior individually and in terms of fitness, but without those two advantages, there’s nothing to fall back on. Subsequent managers have focused on winning, and have largely been very successful, but haven’t implemented much of a philosophy.\n“The intensity in European football really has grown the last couple of years, as well as the fitness,” said Netherlands manager Andries Jonker, speaking before the 1-1 draw between the sides in the group phase. “In the past, the American women were a lot fitter than the rest of the world, but I really think those days are over. If you look at the Champions League nowadays, you see the same level of intensity. So the big question is now, what is left of their superiority?”\nTheir most impressive performer here has been Lavelle, a willing runner from midfield but not the most incisive footballer you’ll ever see. She is suspended for the round-of-16 game against Sweden. Even with Lavelle, this side lacks footballing guile and players who can play clever passes. The introduction of Megan Rapinoe for the final half-hour against Portugal was interesting, because while she initially looked dangerous by attempting to thread passes in behind, a welcome development, she was ultimately too ambitious in possession and conceded the ball cheaply.\nRapinoe found a team-mate with just seven of her 22 passes, a 32 per cent completion rate, and at one point bafflingly booted the ball up in the air towards no one in particular, allowing Portugal to break. Passing numbers in isolation can be misleading, but it’s worth noting Morgan’s completion rate was only slightly better: 33 per cent. Lynn Williams’ was 47 per cent and Smith’s 54 per cent. All four of those figures are below each of the 10 Portugal outfielders who started the game.\nThe U.S. weren’t really playing football and they weren’t able to control the game. The most curious aspect of their performance against Portugal was in the final 15 minutes, when they made the game a back-and-forth counter-attack contest at a time when the prospect of a 0-0 was underwhelming but, in terms of progression to the next round, fine. That played into the hands of Portugal, who were two inches away from finding a winner and eliminating their opponents.\nAdvertisement\nDespite all this, it’s far from impossible that the USWNT still win this tournament. In fact, bookmakers still consider them the favourites.\nThe strongest section of the side has been Girma and Julie Ertz’s centre-back partnership, and for all the struggles going forward, this team has conceded only once. If you keep clean sheets, you can progress through tournaments. For all the surprise about Canada being eliminated from this competition early, considering they’re the reigning Olympic champions, they were completely uninspiring in Tokyo two years ago too. They won only one of their three group games, and their three knockout scorelines were 0-0, 1-0 and 1-1, with both the goals they scored coming from the penalty spot. They had no attacking identity. But they didn’t concede many, so they won the tournament.\nMaybe the U.S. will do something similar. Maybe the dribbling skill of their wingers and bursts from their midfielders will prove more decisive against opponents who attack and leave space in behind.\nBut there’s an emptiness, an aimlessness and a lack of intelligence about this U.S. side. Despite high-profile individuals, they’ve been less convincing as a unit than the likes of Portugal and Haiti, sides who have been eliminated. You can blame Andonovski, who is almost certainly out of his depth, but in wider footballing terms, the U.S. don’t really know what they are.\n(Top photo: Ulrik Pedersen/DeFodi Images via Getty Images)",
