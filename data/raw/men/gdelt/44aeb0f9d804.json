  "body_text": "Manchester United are no longer willing to entertain selling Harry Maguire before the window closes and have rejected a fresh approach from West Ham, according to reports.\nThe 30-year-old has fallen dramatically down the pecking order at Old Trafford under Erik ten Hag and is effectively the fifth-choice option now, behind even left-back Luke Shaw.\nUnited had been open to offloading their axed skipper and accepted a bid of £30million from the Hammers earlier this month, though the deal ultimately broke down.\nMaguire – who is also wanted by Everton – was thought to be reluctant to move to east London and unwilling to give up Champions League football, while he would have had to take a significant pay cut.\nDavid Moyes remains keen to sign the former Leicester City man, however, and West Ham tried to find a late solution by offering to contribute to a pay-off that would compensate for his lower salary.\nBut, according to The Times, United have blocked the approach from West Ham and will not allow Maguire to leave before Friday’s transfer window deadline.\nTen Hag would want to bring in a replacement for Maguire should he leave and the club are already scrambling to fill other positions in the squad over the next three days.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nUnited are currently trying to bring in a new, emergency left-back with both Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia sidelined until the backend of the year.\nThey have made contact with a host of clubs and have teed up deals for the likes of Marc Cucurella, Sergio Reguilon and Marcos Alonso and will now need to decide which player they want to pull the trigger on.\nUnited are also poised to seal a £4.3m deal for goalkeeper Altay Bayindir once Dean Henderson has completed a move to Crystal Palace, while Ten Hag also wants to bring in a new midfielder.\nMore Trending\nWith so much business still to do, United will not have time to bring in a high-level replacement for Maguire as well and have therefore decided to keep him.\nThe situation has been impacted by both the injury to Shaw and an issue Raphael Varane picked up in Saturday’s win over Nottingham Forest; the Frenchman’s issue is not thought to be too serious, but he had to be replaced by Victor Lindelof.\nAssuming the Swede and Lisandro Martinez are United’s centre-back pairing in the short-term, that would leave Maguire as the only available cover and the player himself is eager to stay and fight for his place.\nMORE: Fred confirms imminent Manchester United transfer during Fenerbahce unveiling\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
