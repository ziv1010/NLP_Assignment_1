Nigerian stars are not left out as PUNCH Sports Extra’s PEDRO PETER examines the players to look out for as competitive football resumes\nAlex Iwobi and Calvin Bassey (Fulham)\nThe Super Eagles duo of Alex Iwobi and Calvin Bassey will once again be in the thick of the action when Fulham begin their Premier League season with a road trip away to Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday (today). The Cottagers narrowly missed out on European football last season, and manager Marco Silva will be relying on the experience of both the midfielder and the defender as they chase a spot on the continent next year.\nOla Aina and Taiwo Awoniyi (Nottingham Forest)\nAina and Awoniyi are set to feature in European competition when the Tricky Trees begin their continental campaign in the UEFA Europa League.\nAina was instrumental in Forest’s remarkable campaign, and having penned a new contract, head coach Nuno Espirito Santo will be counting on him to make the difference from the right full-back position.\nAwoniyi, on the other hand, just came off the back of an unimpressive season, littered with injury and fitness problems. He faces a fight on his hands in a bid to land a starting shirt against last season’s club top scorer, Chris Wood, amid new arrivals.\nFrank Onyeka (Brentford)\nThe Nigeria international enjoyed an impressive spell while on loan in the German Bundesliga for Augsburg, as he started 25 out of his 26 top-flight fixtures last season and established himself as a key figure in the club’s defensive structure.\nNow back at his parent club, Onyeka will be eyeing a starting berth and will look to be the team’s engine room as they begin their quest with an away clash at Nottingham Forest. He remains the subject of transfer speculation.\nKelechi Iheanacho, Chidera Ejuke and Akor Adams (Sevilla)\nThe trio experienced contrasting but underwhelming campaigns last term. Iheanacho was farmed out on loan to English Championship outfit Middlesbrough, where he had little impact. Ejuke was plagued with injury issues and had to sit out two months at the start of the year, while Adams only recently made a return to full fitness after missing a large chunk of the season due to injury.\nAll three Nigerians will seek to begin the new season on a positive note, as the Spanish La Liga campaign returns with Iheanacho and Ejuke continuing to be linked with an exit away from the Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan.\nChrisantus Uche (Getafe)\nUche was crucial to Getafe retaining their top-flight status last term, scoring three goals and providing five assists in 30 games in what was a remarkable debut campaign in LaLiga.\nThe 21-year-old will be one of the trusted hands as Getafe hope to improve their standing in the league this season.\nChidozie Awaziem (Nantes)\nThe Super Eagles defender recently made a return to French Ligue 1 side Nantes after sealing a move from Major League Soccer club Colorado Rapids.\nPrior to his summer move, he had made 20 appearances for the Rapids, all as a starter, and registered one assist during a 3-2 win over San Diego FC on April 12. He will be expected to contribute meaningfully as Nantes aim to retain their spot in the top-flight.\nMoses Simon (Paris FC)\nThe Super Eagles attacker finalised a summer move from FC Nantes to newly-promoted French Ligue 1 outfit Paris FC for around €7m.\nThe 29-year-old had been a constant feature in Les Canaris’ squad since his arrival in 2020, and he finished the 2024/25 campaign with eight goals and 10 assists in the French top-flight. His knowledge of the French top-flight will be crucial as Paris FC seek to maintain their status in Ligue 1.\nMaduka Okoye (Udinese)\nUdinese’s first-choice shot-stopper and Nigeria international was handed a two-month ban by the Italian Football Federation, following a betting scandal linked to a match against Lazio during the 2023/24 season.\nOkoye will be looking to bounce back from that incident and show why he is one of the top keepers in the Italian Serie A.\nAdemola Lookman (Atalanta)\nThe 2024 CAF Africa Player of the Year is currently at loggerheads with his current club, Atalanta, following their refusal to sanction a summer exit. The Nigeria international, who has been linked with a switch to fellow Serie A giants Inter Milan, has not turned up for pre-season training with the Bergamo-based side.\nIt is left to be seen where Lookman would be playing his football this season, though it is certain that the former Leipzig, Leicester City and Fulham man will maintain his elite standards wherever he finds himself.\nVictor Osimhen (Galatasaray)\nThe 2023 CAF Africa Player of the Year has finally moved on a permanent transfer to Turkish Super Lig giants Galatasaray, after the club forked out a massive €75m for his services.\nThe Nigerian hitman enjoyed a fruitful loan spell at Rams Park, where he scored 37 goals in 41 outings across all competitions for Okan Buruk’s men. He will partner with fellow new signing Leroy Sane as the club seeks to make a deep run in the UEFA Champions League this season.\nWilfred Ndidi (Besiktas)\nThe former Leicester City midfielder completed a summer transfer move to Turkish Super Lig side Besiktas for around €9m. His arrival will bolster Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s midfield options as they aim to mount a title challenge on the domestic front and also make an impression in Europe.\nHenry Onyekuru (Genclerbirligi)\nThe erstwhile Super Eagles winger recently joined Turkish club Gençlerbirliği on a two-year deal. He was previously with Al-Fayha in the Saudi Pro League, but transferred to Gençlerbirliği after rejecting offers from three other unnamed Turkish clubs.\nSemi Ajayi (Hull City)\nThe 2024 AFCON runner-up moved to Hull City on a free transfer, following the expiration of his contract at West Bromwich Albion. The centre-back will be expected to bring his experience to the fore as the Tigers aim to secure promotion to the Premier League next season.\nChuba Akpom (Ipswich Town)\nThe former Middlesbrough forward has just joined English Championship outfit Ipswich Town on a season-long loan deal from Dutch Eredivisie giants Ajax Amsterdam.\nThe 29-year-old’s wealth of experience will be crucial as Kieran McKenna’s men seek promotion to the Premier League come the end of the 2025/26 campaign.",
