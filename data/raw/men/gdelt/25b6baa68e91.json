  "body_text": "Liverpool\nPremier League • England\nChief BBC reporter reveals Liverpool plans on sacking Arne Slot\nThe chief football writer with the BBC has revealed what Liverpool plan to do with Arne Slot after the Dutchman masterminded their tame exit from the League Cup on Wednesday night.\nLiverpool are in a tailspin right now and Slot has shown nothing to suggest he can restore order. Four successive defeats in the Premier League have all but ended their hopes of defending their title. A seven-point gap to Arsenal ordinarily wouldn’t be a problem, but Mikel Arleta’s current crop are no ordinary Arsenal side.\nAs such, all eyes were on the teamsheet Slot named for their League Cup fourth round clash with Crystal Palace on Wednesday night. That competition may have represented Liverpool’s best chance at lifting silverware this season.\nTo the surprise of many, Slot named a team full of fringe players and youngsters. His bench consisted entirely of youth team players and with such a weak squad named, defeat to the Eagles was inevitable and called pre-match by a prominent journalist.\nUpcoming fixtures against Aston Villa, Real Madrid (Champions League) and Manchester City have now assumed even greater significance.\nThe decision to rotate heavily was unquestionably made with one eye on those games. Yet defeat next time out against Villa would prompt serious questions as to why Slot surrendered their shot at winning a trophy a few days prior on Wednesday night.\nNow, the BBC’s chief football writer, Phil McNulty, has weighed in on whether Liverpool will show Slot the door.\nIn a Q&A held earlier on Wednesday, McNulty was asked: ‘With Palace, Villa, Real Madrid and Man City coming up would, say, three more defeats put Arne Slot under real pressure? Liverpool don’t sack managers easily, but surely if this run of form persists then even the most successful manager could be in trouble.’\nMcNulty answered: “Slot is under the same pressure as every Liverpool manager – and that is the pressure to win games. Pressure for his job? Not a chance.\n“Slot won the title in his first season after succeeding Jurgen Klopp, and while he needs wins as quickly as possible, Liverpool is not the sort of club to panic, even if the next sequence of results go badly.\n“I would agree, however, that they need to show signs of becoming more resilient and balanced, because I think they are a dysfunctional, soft touch at the moment. And, Hugo Ekitike apart, their big signings have not yet delivered.\n“Slot however still has plenty of credit in the bank and Liverpool is a calm club internally, not given to hasty, panicky decisions, certainly not when it involves a manager who won the Premier League last season.”\nWhat if poor form continues until Christmas?\nA follow-up question was put to McNulty, with the trusted reporter asked whether Slot could be axed if the dismal results persist through to Christmas.\nMcNulty replied: “Of course, Slot would be under heavy scrutiny if the current dreadful run continues until Christmas, as any manager of a club of Liverpool’s stature would be. He would be under pressure – but not, in my opinion, for his job.\n“Liverpool’s owners are measured. They saw Slot win the title in his first season and I am sure there will be an acceptance and understanding that there has also been a lot of change in the summer.\n“What he needs now is for established stars and new acquisitions to simply play better. He also needs to find his best team as I am not sure he actually knows.\n“I also think the presence of both Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak gives him a conundrum, on how to best utilise those two players. So far Ekitike has delivered. Isak has not.”\nWhat Fabrizio Romano has said about Slot sack\nSpeaking earlier this week, trusted transfer guru, Fabrizio Romano, also insisted Slot is not in any immediate danger of being relieved of his duties.\nRomano also went on to explain what Liverpool chiefs believe is really causing the club’s on-field issues right now.\n“Liverpool absolutely internally… and when I say internally it’s the hierarchy, the ownership, al the people at the club, really, really trust Arne Slot,” declared Romano.\n“They are 100 percent convinced that Arne Slot is the best manager to handle this situation.\n“Obviously it’s been a poor start to the season, but Liverpool are convinced everything will be okay, that it’s going to take some time to assess the squad with the new signings, to change something, to be back to the attitude from last season.\n“But Liverpool have full trust in Slot. There is very good communication on a daily basis between the directors, all the people at the club in the management, and Arne Slot.\n“There is no problem, no bad relationship, and no problems between the players and Slot.\n“So [the issues] are really from a tactical point and also mental, obviously. But it’s not a problem between Slot and the players or Slot and the management.”\nLatest Liverpool news – Deal cancelled? / Chiesa must go / £88m Tottenham raid\nIn other news, Fabrizio Romano has confirmed a deal Liverpool made over the summer has not panned out as the player expected, and there are growing suggestions the move could be aborted.\nElsewhere, TEAMtalk has outlined the six reasons why Federico Chiesa must leave Liverpool despite the Italian openly admitting he wants to stay.\nIn Chiesa’s case, he may need to start thinking with his head and hot just his heart.\nFinally, a stunning report claims Liverpool could sign Tottenham’s best player for £88m.",
