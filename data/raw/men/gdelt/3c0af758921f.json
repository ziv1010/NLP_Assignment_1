It was a very constructive meeting and we're looking forward to working with each other.\"\nIt is expected Ineos will make significant changes to the structure of United, although stock market regulations prevent that from happening at the moment.\nTen Hag says it is too soon for anyone to make decisions of such significance given Ratcliffe and his associates only arrived in the north west on Tuesday, spending time at Old Trafford on Tuesday and again on Thursday to get to know staff members and understand how the club functions.\n\"We have to let it settle down,\" said Ten Hag. \"They are just coming in and introducing themselves. They have good ideas, so we have to see what we can integrate. We will work together but you can't tell that after one day. We have had our debates about strategies and I think we will come together.\"\nRatcliffe, Brailsford and Jean Claude-Blanc have been spending time at Old Trafford and the Carrington training complex this week before their proposed 25% purchase of the club is ratified by the Premier League.\nBBC Sport understands Brailsford led a number of group chats in which he referred to United's \"performance challenge\", which was his way of highlighting the chronic underperformance in recent years.\nIt is thought likely Brailsford will bring in a new technical director once he is legally allowed to make changes.\nThat will put a question mark over the future of current football director John Murtough.\nBrailsford also told staff Ineos will take over United's football operations. This will include determining the future of Ten Hag, who is under pressure after a dismal first half of the season during which his side have suffered 14 defeats and been eliminated from both the Champions League and Carabao Cup.\nOnana available for Wigan\nTen Hag confirmed goalkeeper Andre Onana would be available for the FA Cup trip to Wigan on Monday evening.\nHowever, he says talks are continuing with the Cameroon federation over Onana's availability for the Premier League encounter against Tottenham at Old Trafford on 14 January.\nCameroon's opening group game at the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) against Guinea takes place just 24 hours later.\nUnited are willing to provide a private plane to ensure Onana gets to the game in Yamoussoukro.\nHowever, West Ham boss David Moyes has already questioned how he had to do without two players for Tuesday's draw with Brighton due to Afcon commitments while other clubs were able to pick their African contingent for the same round of fixtures.\nTen Hag feels he is justified in taking his stance as when he signed the goalkeeper from Inter Milan, it was on the understanding that he would not be travelling to the Ivory Coast as he had retired from international duty, only to get talked into changing his mind before the September international break.\n\"It was an issue during the talks with Andre when he came in here,\" said Ten Hag. \"The talks are constructive and we will see.\"\nSancho move edging closer\nJadon Sancho's proposed return on loan to Borussia Dortmund is edging closer.\nIt is understood Dortmund are willing to pay around £3m to get Sancho back for the remainder of the season and want him signed quickly enough for him to join them on their current winter training camp in Marbella.\nSancho's chances of a return under Ten Hag are non-existent after the England international refused to apologise for his explosive social media post accusing the Dutchman of picking on him and telling lies around the reason for his omission from the squad beaten at Arsenal at the beginning of September.\n\"I can't say anything about that,\" said Ten Hag. \"We have to wait and see how things are going.\"\nLatest Stories\n-\nThe Accra Mandate: Securing Africa’s AI Future through Local Data and Ethical Governance\n15 minutes -\nAquafresh donates to National Chief Imam ahead of Ramadan\n40 minutes -\nAdopt a mix of bond and short-term finance to address financing challenges in cocoa industry – Professor Peprah to government\n42 minutes -\nNSA introduces dual authentication system for 2025/26 enrolment exercise\n2 hours -\nFuel prices to increase from Feb. 16, influenced by cedi’s depreciation\n2 hours -\nGNFS to launch automated fire safety compliance system to modernise regulation\n2 hours -\nNALAG president commends Local Gov’t Minister for payment of assembly members’ allowances\n3 hours -\nIs having a physical security operations center in your business worth it?\n3 hours -\nAsiedu Nketia recounts fierce political wars in Ajumako-Enyan-Essiam constituency\n3 hours -\nNRSA sets up committee to probe road crashes involving Toyota Voxy\n3 hours -\nCocoa farmers decry the adverse impact of producer price cut on livelihoods\n3 hours -\nFamilies who lose relatives to ‘no bed syndrome’ must sue health facilities – Dr. Nawaane\n3 hours -\nGhana Sports Fund: Dr. David Kofi Wuaku outlines vision for Youth Empowerment growth through sports\n3 hours -\nNUGS President urges sustainable digital governance\n3 hours -\nNational Investment Bank kicks off Ghana Sports Fund with landmark seed donation\n3 hours",
