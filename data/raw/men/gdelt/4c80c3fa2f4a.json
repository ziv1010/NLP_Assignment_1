They have also recruited winger Harvey Barnes from Leicester City and look set to snare Southampton full-back Valentino Livramento. Manager Eddie Howe has got most things right in terms of recruitment to date.\nBut his latest target will be seen as more of a gamble, with Zaniolo having endured a frustrating career to date.\nThe 24-year-old was signed by Inter Milan in July 2017 but failed to make a single appearance for I Nerazzurri.\nHe moved to Roma the following summer and made 53 Serie A appearances across his first two seasons in the Eternal City.\nHowever, the Massa-born ace then suffered a number of niggling injuries, culminating in a serious knee problem that saw him miss 2020-2021.\nThe Italian enjoyed 28 top-flight outings in 2021-22 under Jose Mourinho, scoring twice.\nAnd he scored the only goal of the game as Roma beat Feyenoord to win the Europa Conference League in May 2022.\nBut a dip in form at the start of last season saw him targeted by a section of Roma fans.\nHe was booed off after a cup game while disgruntled supporters even turned up at his house.\nREAD MORE: Chelsea ecstatic after huge Newcastle bid accepted, as Eddie Howe puts regular starter on notice\nAfter that incident, he submitted a transfer request and left for Galatasaray during the 2023 winter window.\nThings improved in Istanbul, with five goals from ten outings, only two of which were starts. And it appears as though Zaniolo is wanted at a number of top clubs.\nBig-hitters circle for Zaniolo\nTottenham have been heavily linked with a move for Zaniolo in recent times.\nIt has been said that the north London outfit will offer cash plus a few players for the forward and his team-mate Victor Nelsson.\nIt is unclear whether the Turkish giants will play ball on that offer but there are other suitors in the game.\nJuventus and AC Milan have been credited with an interest while clubs from Saudi Arabia are also thought to be keen.\nAnd now Newcastle United have been added to the list of clubs willing to take a punt on the attacking midfielder.\nAccording to Hurriyet the Tynesiders remain ‘in talks’ with Zaniolo and his agents over a summer switch to St James’ Park.\nThere is no question that it would be one of the club’s riskier signings due to his injury history.\nBut he is still a young player and has time to fulfil the potential that has been obvious since a young age.\nWhether Gala are willing to part company with a player they have had for just seven months is another matter, however.\nNewcastle will play in the Champions League in the upcoming campaign.\nHowe needs plenty of midfield options to cope with the rigours of both Premier League and Champions League football.\nZaniolo has plenty of European experience, having played in both the Champions League and Europa League.\nHe is also versatile and can operate up front or as an attacking midfielder behind the main striker.\nThe Magpies are up against some huge clubs in the race for his signature.\nBut they have already shown with previous signings that they can now mix it with the best in the transfer market.",
