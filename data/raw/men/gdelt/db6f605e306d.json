It has to be the responsibility of the people in front to score the goals.”\nRed Star were expected to be lambs to the slaughter after City followed up their treble success last season with a perfect start five games into the new Premier League campaign.\nBut the English champions made life difficult for themselves, while Glazer performed heroics for the Serbian giants before the break.\nErling Haaland has now failed to score in four consecutive Champions League games and was frustrated at himself after heading against the crossbar from point-blank range.\nPhil Foden then nodded an even easier headed opportunity straight at Glazer.\nBernardo blow\nCity’s stretched squad due to injuries was shown as they named only eight of a permitted 12 substitutes, two of which were goalkeepers.\nAnd Bernardo Silva had to be replaced just before half-time by Jeremy Doku in what could be another injury problem for Guardiola.\nRed Star had barely been out their own half in the opening 45 minutes, but City were stunned when Bukari burst in behind and finished confidently past Ederson.\nThe Ghanaian’s joy was temporarily quelled by the offside flag but a VAR check revealed he had been played onside by Ruben Dias.\nCity quickly went to work after the break to ensure that was to be the only shock of the night.\nHaaland may not have found his range in front of goal, but the Norwegian’s clever pass played in Alvarez to round Glazer for the equaliser.\n“We conceded an early goal (in the second-half) and after that it was difficult to maintain the pace, because we never play at this pace in our league,” said Red Star coach Barak Bakhar. “We learned a lot from this match.”\nAll of Glazer’s good work was then forgotten as his miscued punch just helped Alvarez’s free-kick on its way into the top corner.\nKevin De Bruyne’s long-term injury has opened the door to a regular starting spot for Alvarez rather than having to rival Haaland to start up front.\nAnd the 23-year-old is thriving in his second season in English football with four goals in seven games.\n“Every single game he is working, scoring goals, making assists,” added Guardiola.\nRodri was the City hero when they finally conquered Europe for the first time by beating Inter Milan 1-0 in Istanbul in June and the Spaniard is picking up the healthy habit of scoring vital goals.\nThe midfielder was afforded far too much room on the edge of the area and picked his spot with a perfectly weighted curling effort into the far corner to secure the three points.\nChampions League results on Tuesday:\nGroup E\nIn Rotterdam\nFeyenoord (NED) 2 (Stengs 45+2, Jahanbakhsh 76) Celtic (SCO) 0\nIn Rome\nLazio (ITA) 1 (Provedel 90+5) Atletico Madrid (ESP) 1 (Barrios 29)\nGroup F\nIn Milan\nAC Milan (ITA) 0 Newcastle United (ENG) 0\nIn Paris\nParis Saint-Germain (FRA) 2 (Mbappe 49-pen, Hakimi 58) Borussia Dortmund (GER) 0\nGroup G\nIn Berne\nYoung Boys (SUI) 1 (Elia 33) RB Leipzig (AUT) 3 (Simaken 3, Schlager 74, Sesko 90+2)\nIn Manchester\nManchester City (ENG) 3 (Alvarez 47, 60, Rodri 73) Red Star Belgrade (SRB) 1 (Bukari 45)\nGroup H\nIn Barcelona\nBarcelona (ESP) 5 (Felix 11, 66, Lewandowski 19, Bataille 22-og, Gavi 54) Antwerp (BEL) 0\nIn Hamburg, Germany\nShakhtar Donetsk (UKR) 1 (Kelsy 13) Porto (POR) 3 (Galeno 8, 15, Taremi 29)\nPlaying Wednesday (kick-offs 1900 GMT unless stated):\nGroup A\nIn Istanbul, Turkey (1645 GMT)\nGalatasaray (TUR) v Copenhagen (DEN)\nIn Munich, Germany\nBayern Munich (GER) v Manchester United (ENG)\nGroup B\nIn Seville, Spain\nSevilla (ESP) v Lens (FRA)\nIn London\nArsenal (ENG) v PSV Eindhoven (NED)\nGroup C\nIn Madrid (1645 GMT)\nReal Madrid (ESP) v Union Berlin (GER)\nIn Braga, Portugal\nBraga (POR) v Napoli (ITA)\nGroup D\nIn San Sebastian, Spain\nReal Sociedad (ESP) v Inter Milan (ITA)\nIn Lisbon\nBenfica (POR) v S\nIn an age of information overload, Sunrise is The Namibian’s morning briefing, delivered at 6h00 from Monday to Friday.
