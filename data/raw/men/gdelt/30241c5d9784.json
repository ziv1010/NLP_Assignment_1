However, Calcio adds that in case of a contract renewal with Inter, the Nerazurri could end up demanding even more.\nIt would be a surprise, however, if Ten Hag moved for a new right-back when it appears there are much more pressing needs for a struggling United side.\nMidfield appears to be the most glaring need, with United often getting over-ran by rivals and there are no shortage of players being linked with a switch to Old Trafford.\nBrondby attacking midfielder Nicolai Vallys is the latest name being linked with the club, as reported by Monday’s Euro Paper Talk.\nHowever, at this stage, Ten Hag will have to make do with what he has and hope that results pick up.\nREAD MORE: Exclusive: Man Utd, Bayern Munich and Dortmund interested in unwanted Chelsea defender",
