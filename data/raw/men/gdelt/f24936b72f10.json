  "body_text": "Hugo Ekitike reckons Alexander Isak competition will boost him at Liverpool\nBy Simon Peach, PA Chief Football Writer, Istanbul\nHugo Ekitike believes Alexander Isak’s presence will aid his development as the young striker welcomed the increased competition at Liverpool.\nArne Slot’s Premier League champions made waves in the summer transfer window, with the 23-year-old following the likes of Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong, and Milos Kerkez to Anfield.\nEkitike joined from Frankfurt in a deal worth £69million plus a potential £10m (€11.45 million) in add-ons and has hit the ground running, scoring five goals in eight appearances in all competitions.\nBut Liverpool maintained a strong interest in Newcastle sharpshooter Isak throughout the summer and got their man for a British record £125m on deadline day.\n“I think it’s good with players in such a big club,” Ekitike said. “I can’t see one big club playing with only one striker, so I think it’s good that he’s here.\n“Even for me at my age, I think I still have a lot of things to improve and learn, so for me it’s good that he’s here.\n“(As for if we can play together) that’s for the coach to decide how he wants to play. That’s not me.\n“But obviousl,y it’s great players, I’ve been playing in two-striker composition, one-striker… so I can do a lot of things. If we have to play together, I can do that.”\nEkitike certainly appears to be loving life at Liverpool, who he joined despite interest from the likes of Manchester United and Newcastle.\n“It was just the best choice,” he said. “You know, it’s the champions of England.\n“For me, they have great players, a great history. It just fitted with what I was looking for after Frankfurt.”\nEkitike was speaking on the eve of Liverpool’s Champions League match at Galatasaray, where the young striker is in line to make his first appearance since last Tuesday’s embarrassing sending-off.\nThe Frenchman replaced Isak at half-time of the Carabao Cup clash against Southampton and went on to score a late winner, removing his shirt and holding it up to the cameras in celebration.\nBut the substitute had already been booked and collected what Slot called a “stupid” red card that ruled him out of Saturday’s 2-1 loss at Crystal Palace.\n“I think that wasn’t smart,” Ekitike said. “Obviously, I punished myself alone, I’d say.\n“I felt a bit disappointed to watch the boys from home the last Saturday,y but, as I said (on Instagram), I apologise to everybody already, to my team-mates.\n“That kind of thing won’t happen again. I just move on now. I am just looking forward to playing and I just focus on football.”\nEkitike will hope to make amends in Istanbul, where Liverpool arrived without Federico Chiesa due to what Slot called a “little niggle”.\nThe Liverpool boss did not want to take any risks with Saturday’s trip to Chelsea coming up – a match he hopes to head into on the back of a morale-boosting victory against Galatasaray.\n“I think we always have to do – no matter if you win, lose or draw – what is asked of you if you want to compete for trophies, but let alone if you wear a Liverpool shirt,” Slot said.\n“That is giving everything you have and combining that with the best football you can play.\n“We created more chances during the course of the game, more chances than we had in all the three games we played before against Palace, but we also conceded many more chances than we did before.\n“So we can improve, and the things we can improve I will show tonight to the players.”",
