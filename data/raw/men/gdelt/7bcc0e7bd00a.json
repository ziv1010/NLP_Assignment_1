Graham Potter turned down both proposals.\nThere is interest from Saudi Pro League, but the ex-Manchester City academy ace is hellbent on staying in the Premier League with the likes of Newcastle, Brentford and Aston Villa interested.\nBut moving to either might need him to lower his wage demands, something the United star has no intention of doing, and now, as per Il Bianconero, Juventus have also joined the race.\nThey have been long-term admirers, and were among the teams chasing his signature last summer. Now, they do not want to pay as much but continue to monitor proceedings with interest. No amount is mentioned nor the formula of a deal.\n“Jadon Sancho could once again have a summer on the market after last year. Chelsea will not exercise the option to buy, even paying a penalty of 6 million euros, and therefore the player will return to the Red Devils, and then relocate elsewhere, given that he is not part of Manchester United’s plans.\nJuventus has joined the race\n“According to Tuttosport, the English winger could return to the game for Juventus, who had tried to sign him at the end of August but failed.\n“There is no negotiation going on at the moment and, the newspaper reports, it is not certain that he is still worth what he was worth a year ago (after all, the management at Continassa has also changed), but Sancho could become an idea capable of teasing many Champions League clubs, including Juve.\n“Also because the contract expiring in 2026 favors a low-cost operation. He is clearly not a priority for the Bianconeri at the moment, who are dealing with very important issues, but his name will still be monitored.”\nThey are aware that Jadon Sancho has a contract with United till 2026 and the English giants will be desperate to move him on so a low-cost exit could be on the cards.\nWhether Juve go all out to land him remains to be seen. It is likely that the versatile attacker will move to the side who offers him the largest wages or at least close to what he was earning at Old Trafford.\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
