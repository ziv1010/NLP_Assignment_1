He's on the field, he's smelling a goal,\" Casemiro said. \"You have to be worried with this guy because he will score a goal. Cristiano was like that.\"\nMbappe's PSG contract expires at the end of the 2023/24 season and he is widely expected to join Madrid on a free transfer on lucrative personal terms.\nWith 284 goals in 374 club games, the 25-year-old footballer is PSG's all-time leading scorer with 253 goals, 53 clear of second-place Edinson Cavani.\nMbappe is set to join Los Blancos later this summer.\nHis final game for PSG could yet come against his likely future employers, with both sides through to the semi-finals of this season's Champions League.\nLes Parisiens have been drawn with Borussia Dortmund, while Madrid will take on Bayern Munich.\nThe 39-year-old former Manchester United star, Ronaldo, who has been cited as Mbappe's idol, joined Madrid in 2009 for a then-world record £80 million fee.\nHe scored 450 goals for the club, more than any other player in their history. He was also a key contributor to 15 trophies and won four of his five Ballons d'Or during his time in the Spanish capital.",
