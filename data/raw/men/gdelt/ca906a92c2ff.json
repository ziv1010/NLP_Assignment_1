  "body_text": "Morocco head coach Walid Regragui has eased Manchester United’s fears over Sofyan Amrabat’s injury.\nAmrabat completed his season-long loan move from Fiorentina to United on the final day of the summer transfer window.\nUnited will pay an initial £8.5 million (€10m) to sign Amrabat on loan and have an option to make the deal permanent for £21.4m (€25m).\nEarlier this week, United were dealt a scare as Amrabat withdrew from Morocco’s squad ahead of their upcoming Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Liberia and their friendly against Burkina Faso.\nBut Regragui has confirmed that Amrabat’s absence is only a ‘precaution’. United are now hopeful that the midfielder will be available for their Premier League clash against Brighton next Saturday.\n‘Sofyan Amrabat felt something and we let him go as a precaution, because he has just started his new adventure with Manchester United,’ Regragui said.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

With others we have to make compromises but, with Sofryan Amrabat, we have another one.\nMore Trending\n‘Also he can play alongside Casemiro because he can also play a little bit higher on the pitch. So it’s very good to have him and I think he fits very good to Premier League football, to Champions League football. I think the demands are strong.\n‘He is very dynamic, he’s very good in the duels.
