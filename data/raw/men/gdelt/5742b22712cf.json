And out, too, with bad habits that crept in during their bleak winter of 2024, when it looked like City, who began that season chasing a fifth straight Premier League title, might be in a state of worrying decline.\nAdvertisement\nManager Pep Guardiola’s interventions early in the new year ensured that City turned things around and found a solid enough base to make a late dash into the five Champions League qualification places. It was an achievement that gave Guardiola a great dose of satisfaction.\nCity started 2025 in sixth, but that only told part of the story. Most other teams would have finished 12th or 13th if they had been as down and out, and so plagued by injuries. That City recovered to make it 13 years in a row in Europe’s elite competition sent them into the summer hopeful of making a fresh start.\nThe Club World Cup was supposed to serve as that line in the sand but instead, defeat to Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia in the round of 16 underlined just how much change was required.\nEderson, Kyle Walker, Manuel Akanji, Ilkay Gundogan, Kevin De Bruyne and Jack Grealish all left. Over 1,500 Premier League appearances and 83 winners’ medals between them wiped out. But so, too, some big, big wages.\nA January splurge had already brought in Abdukodir Khusanov, Vitor Reis, Nico Gonzalez and Omar Marmoush. In the summer, Gianluigi Donnarumma, James Trafford, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki joined them in the blue half of Manchester. A gross total of around £380million ($508m) was spent, but the squad’s average age dropped dramatically. City had their legs and their vigour back. Refreshed.\nAlthough there have been hiccups in the first half of this season, City end 2025 with growing optimism.\nGuardiola looks invigorated compared to the haunted figure that was left scratching his head (as in, actually gouging scratches into the skin) 12 months earlier. Erling Haaland looks better than ever, Phil Foden is back to his top level and Cherki has given the crowd a new creator to be moved by. It tees up 2026 to be the year they re-establish themselves as the dominant force.\nAdvertisement\nThis could well be Guardiola’s final season in charge, after what will be a decade at the club. If it is, and he ends it back in the winners’ enclosure, 2025 will be regarded as the year of rearmament before his greatest battle of all.\nBest moment\nQualifying for the Champions League on the final day of the season with a 2-0 away win against Fulham ended 2024-25 on a high. It also gave Gundogan one final highlights-reel moment and allowed the away support to pay tribute to De Bruyne in his farewell game.\nThere have been better all-round performances, but Foden’s added-time winner against Leeds United in November felt like the most euphoric moment. After a dramatic collapse from two up at half-time to 2-2 on 68 minutes, it was a moment which re-affirmed that City’s homegrown hero was ready to be a leader, underlined their credentials as title contenders and proved that last season’s inability to reset after a moment of adversity had been vanquished.\nWorst moment\nThe 1-0 FA Cup final loss to Crystal Palace was gutting for City, due to the number of chances they missed in the game. They actually played well but it summed up a season they ended trophy-less for the first time in eight years.\nIt was nothing compared to the 5-1 battering by Arsenal in February, though. That was the most brutal showcasing of City’s flaws and the fact that they had fallen behind their rivals in every aspect of the game. The nadir.\nBest game\nWinning away at the Bernabeu is always a special occasion but that early December encounter was not a classic, nor was it a knockout match.\nThe two games that stand out are the Bournemouth (3-1) and Liverpool (3-0) victories, which came a week apart in November. This was when Guardiola settled on a front four of Cherki, Foden, Jeremy Doku and Haaland. It felt like the time the team clicked into something resembling a top team. The rapid combinations to cut through both teams were ruthless, the new age of Guardiola’s football.\nAdvertisement\nBest player\nThere would be a good chance Guardiola would say it’s been Bernardo Silva. Not because he has been the best but because he would say the man he appointed captain in the summer, although not the same incessant midfielder as in the years before, has been integral to ensuring his team came through a painful transition. There were games in which Bernardo was clearly exhausted and, after the hour mark, could barely run.\nGuardiola told reporters: “In certain moments, he said, ‘Pep, I’m drained. My mind is not (there) anymore. It’s defeat, defeat, defeat’. But he was there! He was there! And I said many times, that will not be forgotten. That’s why he’s my captain. Because in bad moments, he proved (himself).”\nBut Haaland, even though the goals dried up in the second half of last season by his standards, has to be the choice for just how formidable he has been the last six months. A total of 40 goals in the calendar year has been allied with the development of his leadership skills and the evolution of his all-round game.\nFoden started the year scoring in four consecutive Premier League games and repeated the trick in December. Had he not suffered a lull in the spring, he would have been in contention here, given how much his game has matured this season.\nThe stat that sums up 2025\nCity have lost just one more Premier League game in the entirety of 2025 (seven) than they did in the 50-day period between November 2 and December 21 of 2024. It does not need more explaining.\nFavourite quote\nWhen City went from 5-1 up against Fulham just before the hour mark to guarding a one-goal lead like their lives depended on it in early December, Guardiola’s first words upon entering the press room were: “Did you enjoy it? I lost my hair.”\nHe finished answering the questions in a similar fashion, finding the composure to mock the assembled media.\n“At 5-1, you thought it was finished, huh?” Guardiola said, with a Grinch-like smirk on his face.\n“You had written your articles. Tomorrow: ‘Manchester City are back… finally’. And after (Fulham’s comeback), to the trash — you have to start again.”\nMost surprising thing that happened\nIf City falling off a cliff edge was the surprise of 2024, then their hiring Jurgen Klopp’s former Liverpool assistant, Pep Lijnders, was undoubtedly the biggest shock, as the two clubs had forged the greatest rivalry of the modern Premier League era.\nAdvertisement\nGuardiola has been known to refresh his roster of assistants to ensure he stays sharp and is challenged, but to opt for a proponent of Klopp’s more transitional, fast-tempo style of play felt like a piece of recruitment with a deeper philosophical rationale. This has proven to be the case, with City incorporating some of the approach more commonly associated with Klopp’s Liverpool into their game this season.\nWhich of your club’s players will do best at the World Cup?\nThis is a high-risk choice, but if Nico O’Reilly continues to play like he is doing now for the rest of the season, he could well cement himself as England’s first-choice left-back under Thomas Tuchel. It has become expected for England to reach the semi-final stage in major tournaments and if the 20-year-old can add his driving runs to the team, he could help address one of their big weak points.\nFailing that, Haaland leading the line for a Norway side returning to the world stage for the first time in nearly three decades promises to be a fascinating watch. In the City striker and Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard, the Norwegians have two superstars, and plenty more of their team are playing in top-level leagues, too.\nPlayer to watch in 2026\nKhusanov. The Uzbekistan international defender started life at City looking like he was permanently on the verge of tears, after being thrown into a Premier League game against Chelsea a day after arriving in the UK armed with zero English and then gifting the opposition a goal and getting booked inside the first six minutes.\nHe recovered from that and, although he has not cemented a place in the team, has shown at both right-back and centre-back that his exceptional pace could be a huge asset in the modern game. Khusanov is raw but, at just 21, could play a big role in City’s future.\nA wish for 2026\nAn experiment to be done in which Donnarumma borrows Haaland’s mouth tape and sees if he can still get himself five bookings for dissent.",
