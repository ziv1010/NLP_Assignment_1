Erik ten Hag now has to try and lift the spirits of everyone and the only way you can do that is getting a result (at Liverpool).\n\"It's a desperate situation they find themselves in.\"\nTen Hag's first campaign was relatively positive as the former Ajax Amsterdam manager delivered the League Cup, their first trophy fox six years, and put the club back in the Champions League via a third-placed finish in the Premier League.\nIt earned Ten Hag plenty of credit in the bank but he is using it up fast, even if the fans are largely still behind him.\nThe truth is, despite £400 million pounds being spent on new signings since Ten Hag took charge, United look like a team lacking a clear vision or direction.\nJaap Stam, a Champions League winner with United in the treble-winning 1999 side, said he fears for fellow Dutchman Ten Hag and says United's recent banning of some media outlets over stories of dressing room rifts just adds to the malaise.\n\"You need to have peace and quiet,\" he said.\n\"You don't want to pay too much attention to other things like players and the press. It has to do with your players as well, but he invested a lot of money in players that he brought.\n\"But are they the right players? My opinion is that they're not.\"\nALSO READ\n- Manchester United sign $1.1 billion Adidas kit deal for 10 years\n- Manchester United name Fernandes as new captain\nWhile imminent investment into the club by Jim Ratcliffe offers some cheer, the immediate concern is a trip to Anfield without suspended captain Bruno Fernandes and defenders Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw after they were injured against Bayern.\n\"I am trying not to think about that,\" former United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel told CBS Sports.\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
