  "body_text": "Two of the greatest clubs in the history of football meet up in a heavyweight match in the opening round of the knockout stage of the 2024-25 UEFA Champions League season, as Manchester City plays host to Real Madrid on Tuesday.\n- Watch the UEFA Champions League on FuboTV (7-day free trial) and Paramount+\nThe fact that two clubs of this stature are already facing off this early in the tournament is surprising. Unlike years past when the teams were split up into separate groups, the new format saw clubs face eight different teams, providing a different outlook on the season.\nFor Manchester City, they didn’t quite have the best opening round. The three-time defending English Premier League champions went a measly 3-2-3, finishing 22nd in the 36-team pool, escaping elimination thanks to goal differential.\nReal Madrid, the defending UCL champions, also struggled for stretches of the early part of the season. The powerhouse La Liga club also lost three times, but their five wins put them in the seeded portion of the rankings, finishing 11th, just four points ahead of Manchester City, but one back of getting a bye into the Round of 16.\nReal Madrid was able to end Manchester City’s hopes of a repeat treble last year, knocking them out in the quarterfinals.\nUEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE\nKnockout Play-offs (First Leg)\nManchester City FC vs. CF Real Madrid\nWhen: Tuesday, February 11\nTime: 3 p.m. ET\nWhere: Etihad Stadium (Manchester, U.K.)\nChannel: TUDN, UniMas\nStream: FuboTV (Free trial), Sling, DirecTV Stream, Paramount+",
