  "body_text": "Manchester United have progressed a lot this season under Erik ten Hag with the club still competing on all four fronts.\nTalks of a title charge flickered after some impressive results but a couple of poor performances meant those have fizzled out with many pointing out the lack of squad depth as a major reason.\nThe Dutch manager knows the importance of recruiting well next season if the club are to take the next step in their evolution.\nUnited monitoring Juventus situation\nThe Red Devils are monitoring with interest the situation surrounding Juventus after their 15-point penalty for orchestrating a transfer scam over three seasons.\nThe Turin-based club are in danger of missing out on Champions League football and that could dent the club’s financial prospects and their ability to attract top talent and hold on to their big stars.\nAlready, rumours have been rife that Dusan Vlahovic is among Ten Hag’s targets and now, Federico Chiesa’s name has also entered the fray.\n🚨🇮🇹| Manchester United\nManchester United are ‘interested’ in acquiring the services of Juventus star and Italy international Federico Chiesa.[Calciomercatoweb] #MUFC pic.twitter.com/FgoxYHp88B\n— UtdActive (@UtdActive) January 26, 2023\nIt has been a difficult period recently for the Italy international with Chiesa recently recovering from an ACL injury that he had picked up last year.\nBut the 25-year-old recently finally opened his account for the season, by scoring against Monza in the Coppa Italia. And that has sprung the rumour mill into action.\n“The winger seems to have finally returned to his level (ask Monza ), and in view of next summer there could be the onslaught of Manchester United,” a report from Calcio Mercato said.\nChiesa could solve United’s right-wing problems\nThe report also states that Ten Hag is hell-bent on taking United back to the top and they will not be scared off with his price tag of €100million.\n“The ‘Red Devils’ are returning to the top of the Premier League with ten Hag and, among their next targets, the former Fiorentina player cannot be excluded. About 100 million euros could end up on the plate, Juve has already been warned.”\nThe Italian has also been linked with a move to Liverpool with Mohamed Salah’s future still uncertain.\nRight wing is one position where United are short of options at the moment and Chiesa could definitely solve that issue. He has been a long-term United target ever since his days at Fiorentina.\nUnited Matchday Magazine – be in the know about everything in red!\nStill itching for more United content?
