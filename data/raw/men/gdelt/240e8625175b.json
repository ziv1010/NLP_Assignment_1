I am at Napoli, I signed a new contract and I am enjoying my time there.\n“I already know what I want to do at the end of the season. I already knew what I wanted to do in my career since I started, and I want to make my own decision.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\n“I already know what I want to do and the next steps I want to take. I want to finish the season strong and then come up with a decision I’ve already made.”\nOsimhen netted 31 goals for Napoli last season to firmly establish himself as one of the most sought-after forwards playing European football with Arsenal also linked with a move for the 25-year-old.\nMore Chelsea stories\nChelsea plan Karim Benzema bid as Frenchman requests Saudi exit\nChelsea to integrate two more wonderkids to their squad, with funds tight this month: report\nChelsea praised for 'smart' transfer business, with expert lauding club's decision-making\nFor more than a decade, Joe Mewis has worked in football journalism as a reporter and editor.
