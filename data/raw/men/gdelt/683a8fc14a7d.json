That's why we play football, you have to believe in the impossible,\" said Lukaku in an interview with Sky at the weekend.\nReady to take advantage of a Napoli slip-up are Juventus, who are at struggling Cremonese and embroiled in one of Italian football's biggest scandals in years.\nJuve are set to name an entire new board later this month after the previous one collectively stepped down as prosecutors in Turin accuse the club of a variety of financial crimes.\nThose include lying to the stock market when announcing at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic that players would help the club save 90 million euros by giving up four month's pay, instead allegedly making a private agreement for the team to forgo just one payment.\nHowever they are sitting third after recovering from a dismal start to the season with six straight league wins leading up to the World Cup break.\nJuve will be missing Dusan Vlahovic as coach Massimiliano Allegri deals with a series of injuries which still includes Paul Pogba, who missed the World Cup for finalists France and is yet to play a single game for the club since returning last summer.\nMade into a figure of fun after his display of poor finishing in Belgium's World Cup group-stage elimination, Lukaku is now fit and ready to rebuild his reputation as one of Europe's most feared strikers.\nThe 29-year-old missed a hatful of chances in a goalless draw with Croatia which ended the Red Devils' chances in Qatar but hadn't even played a half of football since August before coming on as a second-half substitute.\n\"Croatia was a huge disappointment but I told myself: 'Romelu, you weren't 100 percent, you'd only had two training sessions,\" said Lukaku.\n\"I was rightly massacred but now I really want to get back out on the pitch.\"\n11 - Napoli's league winning streak before the World Cup\n2 - Lukaku has featured just twice for Inter since August.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
