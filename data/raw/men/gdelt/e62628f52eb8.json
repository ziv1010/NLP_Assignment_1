He’s struggled for game time, had just two starts in the Champions League, so he’s not started a Serie A game.\n“Inter are definitely open to his departure to try and save some money and boost their own transfer coffers. Whether they’ll be able to sell Zielinski to Leeds, that remains to be seen.\n“He’s 31 now, but I still feel he’s got a lot to offer and the player himself would be interested in a move away in January in search of regular first team football.\n“If he’s not going to be getting that at Inter, he will maybe seek a move away.”\nREAD MORE ⚪🔵🟡 Farke reveals ’24-hour’ Jurgen Klopp availability to Leeds United as Red Bull links to Liverpool legend are finally explained\nLeeds United should consider Inter Milan raid\nZielinski is yet to start a league game for Inter this season, but he has bags of experience at a high level, which could make him a valuable signing for Leeds.\nThe 103-time capped Polish international made 364 appearances for Napoli and notched 51 goals and 46 assists for them, before joining Inter in the summer of 2024.\nZielinski has not had the same impact at Inter so far, with two goals and four assists from 46 games.\nBut having won two major trophies and reaching a Champions League final with Inter last term, he could bring a winning mentality to the Leeds dressing room.\nZielinski can play as a defensive, central or attacking midfielder, so could provide cover in multiple key areas for Leeds.\nIt isn’t clear at this stage how much the Whites would have to pay to sign him, though Transfermarkt value him at just €10m (£8.7m / $11.6m).\nIt will be interesting to see whether Leeds are tempted to submit a bid for Zielinski in the winter transfer window.\nFootball Insider also note that Sheffield United’s Gustavo Hamer remains a target for Leeds, so it’s clear that Farke is open to bringing in a new attacking midfielder in January.\nDON’T MISS 👉 Every Premier League manager’s contract expiry date as Sean Dyche takes Nottingham Forest job",
