We express our sincere apologies to our loyal fan base, and we greatly appreciate the understanding and forgiveness of all the fans,\" said the statement released by Guangzhou FC on Monday.\nThe club's prolonged financial woes — partially due to the collapse in 2021, and ultimate liquidation in January last year, of its parent company Guangzhou Evergrande Real Estate Group — first raised widespread concerns over the future of the two-time AFC Champions League winner at the end of 2022, when it was relegated from the topflight CSL, to the second-tier China League One. Things were exacerbated due to the lack of revenues across the whole of China's soccer league system.\nThe already fragile financial status of China's soccer pyramid was dealt a heavy blow by the pandemic, with a long list of investors divesting their soccer interests one after another. A series of legal disputes between clubs and players, especially some expensive imports, over unpaid wages made international headlines.\nRight after the CFA listed Guangzhou among the clubs considered financially capable of keeping their league access in an initial review on Dec 20, Chinese national team striker Wei Shihao, a former Evergrande player, citing his long overdue wages from the 2022 relegation season, immediately questioned the approval, posting on Weibo: \"How come Guangzhou passed?\"\nTwo other clubs — top-flight team Cangzhou Mighty Lions and the third tier's Hunan Billows — also announced that they were disbanding on Monday after failing to meet the financial requirements for the new season.\nMost Popular\n- Guangdong beats Macao 2-0 in first leg of soccer cup\n- Para teams set to leave mark on ice\n- US skier Johnson wins women's downhill as Vonn crashes at Milan-Cortina Games\n- Su Yiming clinches first medal at Milano-Cortina\n- Over 300 athletes from 35 countries and regions kick off Asian championships in Tianjin\n- Legacy of Beijing 2022 lives on as Milan welcomes Games",
