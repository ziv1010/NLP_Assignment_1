Arsenal agreed a fee with West Ham United for Declan Rice and confirmed the signing of Kai Havertz from Chelsea. The Germany international is one of four high-profile departures from the west London club this week, with Edouard Mendy and Kalidou Koulibaly moving to Saudi Arabia (Al Ahli and Al Hilal respectively), and Mateo Kovacic joining Manchester City.\nWith Mount on the verge of a move to Old Trafford, how have we got to this stage? Why is this happening now? And what could Mount bring to United?\nFollow the summer transfer window with The Athletic…\nWhat has happened?\nLiam Twomey: With Mount entering the final year of his current contract and no new deal agreed, United have reached an agreement with Chelsea to sign the midfielder.\nChelsea’s owners, led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital co-founder Behdad Eghbali, have made it clear they will not allow valuable players to leave Stamford Bridge as free agents, as Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen did in the summer of 2022.\nTiming is important in this deal and so despite Chelsea turning down a third bid from United for Mount last week, it was in both clubs’ interests to get an agreement in place as soon as possible.\nWhy is this happening now?\nPhil Buckingham: June 30 is the last opportunity for some clubs to enhance their accounts for the 2022-23 season through player sales and, in this era of financial fair play (FFP), it is a point of increasing relevance across European football.\nThere is a reason negotiations over Mount’s prospective move from Chelsea to Manchester United, for example, have stepped up a gear. Finalising transfers before the end of the month matters for those who have flown close to the sun.\nGO DEEPER\nThe new transfer deadline day? Why June 30 matters to many football clubs\nThe last five days have seen four high-profile departures from Chelsea, banking the club at least £120m, with Mount potentially to follow soon: Kalidou Koulibaly (£20m to Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal), Mateo Kovacic (an initial £25m to Manchester City), Edouard Mendy (£16m to Al Ahli) and Kai Havertz (£62m to Arsenal).\nAdvertisement\nA quick deal to sell Mount is also favourable for Chelsea — at the right price, of course. But Manchester United have the opposite problem: the reason given for their refusal to budge much beyond paying £55million for Mount is that FFP rules limit what they can spend before June 30. United posted losses of £115.5million for the 2021-22 season due to playing games behind closed doors during the pandemic and overspent their budget for signings last summer by more than £100million.\nWhy would Mount leave Chelsea?\nTwomey: This is a complicated question. Mount has been significantly underpaid for the best part of three years; he remains one of the lowest-paid members of Chelsea’s first-team squad, earning less than £100,000 per week ($124,000), on the five-year deal he signed at the beginning of the 2019-20 season.\nHe was a returning loanee and a recent Cobham graduate at that point. He has since played a key role in the Champions League triumph of 2021, established himself as an England regular and been voted Chelsea’s player of the year twice.\nGO DEEPER\nChelsea are relying on Arsenal and Manchester City, not Saudi Arabia, to ease FFP concerns\nMarina Granovskaia, Chelsea’s former director, felt little urgency to revisit Mount’s contract situation in the final years of Roman Abramovich’s ownership, and since assuming control of the club last summer, Boehly and Eghbali have been unable to tie Mount down to a new deal that better reflects his status at the club.\nIt is also fair to say the constant turbulence of a season that ended with Chelsea finishing 12th in the Premier League, sacking Thomas Tuchel and replacement Graham Potter in the process, has not helped matters as Mount weighed up his future.\nIs there still a chance he stays at Chelsea?\nTwomey: It had looked as though Chelsea’s only remaining hope of convincing Mount to sign a new contract rested on incoming head coach Mauricio Pochettino making a compelling personal intervention. However, with a fee now agreed with United, even this seems unlikely.\nAdvertisement\nNothing is finalised, but with permission given for a medical to take place, a u-turn to remain at Stamford Bridge looks unlikely.\nWhy have United been so keen on him?\nLaurie Whitwell: United manager Erik ten Hag highlighted two positions as his priority for the summer: a centre-forward and a No 8.\nRegarding the latter, he has wanted an energetic midfielder who can excel in both the defensive and attacking work, which is something Mount can do.\nAnother factor to consider is Scott McTominay’s future. Newcastle United have been interested before and the anticipation is that they will come again for the Scotland midfielder this summer.\nGO DEEPER\nShould Scott McTominay be part of Manchester United's future?\nSo it could be that United see this as a trade, with Mount brought in for not much more money than they sell McTominay for.\nWhat is United’s financial situation?\nWhitwell: United have a budget of about £100million to spend this summer, plus anything they can raise through player sales.\nGoalkeeper Dean Henderson, for example, has been on loan at Nottingham Forest and is one who could be sold to them on a permanent deal, which would help to free up more budget. If Henderson and McTominay were sold for, say, £60million, that would cover the Mount purchase.\nGO DEEPER\nManchester United must use Mason Mount saga to prove negotiating mettle\nUnited’s plan this summer is to get their transfer work done earlier than last and with the sale of the club still uncertain, they are pressing ahead with business as usual.\nEven if a sale of the club did go through, then financial fair play rules would restrict them to a degree.\nHow does this affect United’s transfer plans this summer?\nWhitwell: If the Mount deal goes through, that will affect the amount they can spend on other targets.\nAs well as FFP concerns and the prolonged takeover of the club, United have also been dealing with goalkeeper David de Gea’s future.\nDe Gea, 32, signed a contract offered to him by United, but the club then backed out and offered a deal with a lower salary. United dispute that a document was signed.\nGO DEEPER\nManchester United's striker search: Hojlund, Osimhen, Ramos and Watkins all on radar\nWith this still up in the air, United are weighing up their options and have had contact with Inter Milan goalkeeper Andre Onana’s representatives.\nAdvertisement\nThey have also contacted Moises Caicedo’s team as an alternative to Mount, so a conclusion to the deal for the England midfielder would end that interest and also help with planning for the rest of the summer, as would a decision being made over De Gea’s future.\nGO DEEPER\nWhy Andre Onana would be perfect for Manchester United and Ten Hag\nOn top of this, after a season when he was required to stretch his resources up front, a striker remains a top priority for Ten Hag.\nWhat has Mount’s form been like this season?\nTwomey: This has been the worst season of Mount’s career at Chelsea. He contributed just three goals and two assists in 24 Premier League appearances, after reaching double figures in both for the first time in 2021-22.\nA lingering pelvic injury that ultimately required surgery has played a part. So too have Chelsea’s broader struggles in the attacking half of the pitch, which have regularly seen his position change.\nWhat are his strengths?\nTwomey: With and without the ball, he does everything that might be expected of an attacking midfielder to at least a good level — and has several elite qualities.\nHis best attribute is his understanding of space; he constantly helps his team in possession by moving into little pockets between the opposition lines (as shown below), receiving the ball on the half-turn and moving it forward. His movement is intelligent and flexible.\nMount also sets the tone for the team without the ball, pressing with a relentless intensity and generating high-value turnovers. He is tactically responsible and is smart and versatile enough to fit into a number of roles in a variety of systems.\nAnd what are his weaknesses?\nTwomey: It is less a question of weaknesses with Mount and more about the parts of his game which are not quite elite. His decision-making and execution in the final third can let him down at times, and he can certainly become a more clinical finisher.\nAdvertisement\nYou might even list his versatility, since it has meant he has rarely been used in what he would consider his best role at Chelsea: a dynamic No 8 in a three-man midfield who knits passing sequences together and also attacks the penalty area when the opportunity arises.\nWhere would Mount fit in tactically at United?\nCarl Anka: This move has potential, but might not be a seamless adaptation.\nThe most obvious move would be for Mount to replace Christian Eriksen next to Casemiro.\nMount could provide the same progressive passing, set-piece delivery and late entries into the box of Eriksen while improving United’s defensive intensity when out of possession.\nGO DEEPER\nManchester United squad audit: who stays and who goes this summer?\nThere is some method in United’s pursuit of someone seven years younger than the Dane who can provide similar attacking output plus superior defensive resistance.\nThe question is whether being better than Eriksen or United’s other box-to-box midfielders is a good enough benchmark for what United want to achieve in future seasons.\n(Top photo: Craig Mercer/MB Media/Getty Images)",
