  "body_text": "Chelsea have been dealing with uncertainty on their left flank for quite some time now. Mykhailo Mudryk, on whom the club spent a huge transfer fee, was suspended in December last year after failing a drug test. Loanee Jadon Sancho also failed to impress consistently despite showing sparks of quality and is set to return to Manchester United.\nThe Blues, as a result, have run out of options in the left wing position and are pulling out all the stops to bring in a quality right-footed winger to improve the situation. And it looks like they have a clear choice in their minds.\nChelsea were recently linked with Borussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens. They had also submitted an initial bid in excess of €35 million, but the German club were quick to reject the offer.\nHowever, it looks like the Blues are determined in their pursuit of the player. As reported by Fabrizio Romano, after the €35m proposal was rejected, Chelsea will return with an improved bid. They are set to include add-ons as part of the negotiations with Borussia Dortmund. The player wants the move.\nChelsea preparing to submit improved offer for Gittens after initial bid gets rejected\nGittens played some good football in the 24/25 season. The former Manchester City academy player appeared in 48 matches in all competitions for Borussia Dortmund, scoring 12 goals and providing 5 assists.\nGittens giving the green light to Chelsea is welcome news for the club, as it will make negotiations easier for them. The Blues will now have to focus on the Borussia Dortmund side of things to get the deal over the line.\nBringing in a right-footed left winger isn’t just a want, but a need for Chelsea at the moment. With Champions League football on the horizon, it’s encouraging to see that the club is pushing to bring in Gittens as soon as possible.",
