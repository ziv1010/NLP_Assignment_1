Manchester City 4-3 Real Madrid (and Real Madrid 3-1 Man City), 2021/22\nYou could practically take your pick of the meetings between these two sides, who had never met in a competitive game before 2012 but have gone head-to-head 14 times since then. We've had 3-2s, 3-3s, 4-0s and topsy-turvy 2-1s - but the best of the bunch is this semi-final clash from April 2022.\nCity went 2-0 up inside 12 minutes of the first leg thanks to Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus, only for Karim Benzema to make things interesting by scoring just after the half-hour.\nVinicius Jr responded almost instantly to Phil Foden restoring City's two-goal cushion, which was reinstated once more by Bernardo Silva. Benzema gave Real a lifeline for the second leg once again in memorable fashion late on, though, putting a Panenka past Ederson.\nThe second leg was somehow even more dramatic: City looked on course for the final after Riyhad Mahrez scored in the 73rd minute to make it 5-3 on aggregate, only for Rodrygo to unbelievably level things up with a rapid-fire double in the 90th and 91st minute. Another Benzema penalty in extra time won it for Real.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\n24. Hamburg 4-4 Juventus, 2000/01\nList all of the essential ingredients for a group-stage classic. An early goal? A keeper scoring? A thrilling comeback? A late and contentious equaliser? Tony Yeboah? Just five reasons why Hamburg’s 4-4 draw against Carlo Ancelotti’s Juventus deserves mythical status.\nIgor Tudor’s sixth-minute effort set the tone for a see-saw encounter, with former Leeds hero Yeboah in the thick of it. When Hamburg keeper Hans-Jorg Butt levelled from the spot for 3-3 with 18 minutes remaining, the game still wasn’t done – nor when Niko Kovac tapped in from six yards in the 82nd minute.\nLuckily for Juventus, Filippo Inzaghi tucked away a late penalty to secure a first 4-4 draw in the Champions League.\n23. Barcelona 0-4 Dynamo Kiev, 1997/98\nIn 1986, a nine-year-old boy was forced to leave his home in Kyiv’s suburbs after the Chernobyl nuclear reactor 80 miles north exploded, hurling a radioactive cloud into the atmosphere. Eleven years on, Andriy Shevchenko was scoring a hat-trick past a Barca side that featured Rivaldo and Luis Figo.\n“In Kyiv, we'd beaten Barcelona 3-0 and a friend said, ‘Let’s see how you do in the return’,” Sheva later laughed. “He bet me that I wouldn’t score three goals. He ended up buying dinner.”\nKyiv made the semi-finals the following season before Shevchenko hot-footed it to Milan.\n22. Inter Milan 1-5 Arsenal, 2003/04\nArsenal's Premier League Invincibles-to-be actually turned out to be eminently vincible in the Champions League. After losing 3-0 to Inter and 2-1 to Dynamo Kyiv, plus sharing a goalless stalemate with Lokomotiv Moscow, Arsenal Wenger's side were bottom of their group after four games with just four points.\nEven their lone victory, against Dynamo at Highbury, was eked out 1-0 thanks to an 88th minute goal from Ashley Cole, of all people. That left Arsenal on the brink of elimination as they prepared to visit San Siro: if Dynamo beat Lokomotiv and Inter beat Arsenal, the Gunners would be out of the competition.\nThat's not how it went. Dynamo lost in Moscow earlier in the evening, and Thierry Henry put Arsenal ahead in Milan. Christian Vieri responded, but Freddie Ljungberg restored the lead just after the break before an Henry masterclass hit full stride, with the Frenchman getting another before Edu and Robert Pires finished it off.\nArsenal ended up finishing top of the group; Inter and Dynamo both went out.\n21. Monaco 8-3 Deportivo La Coruna, 2003/04\nCroatian hitman Dado Prso was the biggest winner from this ludicrously open affair, bagging four times in the competition’s highest-scoring match (until Dortmund’s 8-4 win over Legia Warsaw in 2016/17). Deportivo were certainly no push-overs, having finished second in La Liga in 2001/02 above Real Madrid and Barcelona, but this was a horrible day.\nIncredibly, it was only at 7-3 on 52 minutes that the teams chose to play a little more cautiously. Monaco went on to make the final in Gelsenkirchen, where, fittingly, their own defensive frailty cost them against Porto.\n20. Benfica 4-5 Barcelona, 2024/25\nFirst leg drama swooped in at the Estadio da Luz as Barcelona pulled off one of the great UEFA Champions League comebacks to beat Benfica 5-4 in the 2024/25 group stage.\nThe hosts made a stunning start as Greek forward Vangelis Pavlidis hit a 30-minute hat-trick, helped by two mistakes from Wojciech Szczesny, before Robert Lewandowski smashed home to restore the deficit from the penalty spot.\nFurther goals from Raphinha and Lewandowski, either side of an Ronald Araujo own goal, left Barca one behind at 4-3, with their time still for even more late drama in Portugal.\nEric Garcia headed home an equaliser, and in the 96th minute, just after Szczesny had made a fine block from former Real Madrid star Angel di Maria, and Benfica were denied what looked to be a clear penalty, Raphinha broke away and slotted past Anatoliy Trubin to silence the home crowd. Breathless to say the very least.\n19. Liverpool 4-0 Barcelona, 2019\nSalvaging a tie after losing 3-0 in the first leg is a tall order for any side, let alone one playing without two of their first-choice front three (Roberto Firmino and Mo Salah) against bloomin' Barcelona.\nBut then, Liverpool rarely do things the simple way in Europe. An early Divock Origi strike in the second leg at Anfield looked like being mere consolation going into half time, but a two goals in just 122 seconds from Giorginio Wijnaldum incredibly levelled the tie within 11 minutes of the restart.\nThen came the iconic moment. Trent Alexander-Arnold turned to walk away from taking a corner before suddenly turning back and passing a low ball to Origi inside the box. The Belgian was the only man to react as Barcelona stood around going 'duuuh', and Origi smashed home Liverpool's winner to set up a final they would win against Tottenham.\n18. Inter Milan 4-3 Barcelona, 2024/25\nA new entry has to go to Inter Milan for their incredible semi-final comeback against Barcelona at the San Siro that sent the old stadium into utter pandemonium.\nDespite taking the lead through Lautaro Martinez on the night, and Hakan Calhanoglu, making it 5-3 on aggregate, Barcelona's dogged spirit saw them score three times in the second half through Eric Garcia, Dani Olmo and not before Raphinha thumped home what looked to be the winner with just two minutes of normal time remaining.\nInter needed a hero, and 37-year-old Francesco Acerbi puffed out his chest and thundered a drive into the roof of the net from close range, forcing extra time in Milan.\nSubstitute Davide Frattesi won it for the Italian champions with just nine minutes of extra time gone, before Yann Sommer pulled off two magnificent saves with just moments remaining.\n17. Manchester City 4-3 Tottenham, 2018/19\nThis quarter-final tie was finely poised heading into the second leg, with Tottenham leading 1-0 on aggregate but facing the formidable force of Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. The two teams traded four goals equally in a barmy opening 11 minutes, before Bernardo Silva put the hosts 3-2 up on the night midway through the first half.\nSergio Aguero’s strike just before the hour mark gave City the aggregate lead for the first time in the tie, only for Fernando Llorente to put Spurs in pole position on away goals. Raheem Sterling thought he’d won it late on for City, but the VAR’s intervention sent the away fans into raptures and Pep Guardiola to his knees.\n16. Barcelona 1-0 Inter Milan, 2009/10\nJose Mourinho likes three things more than anything: winning, rock-solid defence, and beating Barcelona. He got all three at Camp Nou in 2010 - and with ten men, no less.\nInter's performance that day is remembered as one of the greatest defensive displays ever produced after Thiago Motta was sent off for giving Sergio Busquets a face-push that the Barca midfielder sold like he had just been smashed with a steel chair by the Undertaker.\nFortunately for Inter, they held a 3-1 lead from the first leg. They were not entirely able to resist one of the greatest club sides of all time, of course, but it wasn't until the 84th minute that Gerard Pique pulled on back for Barcelona. Bojan Krkic thought he had scored a late winner on the away goals rule, but it was ruled out for a disputed Yaya Toure handball in the build-up.\nMourinho had pulled it off, and only halted his celebrations in front of the Barca fans when the sprinklers were turned on to chase him off like a cat in your back garden.\n15. Chelsea 4-4 Liverpool, 2008/09\n2005's Chelsea-Liverpool clash was mean, moody and magnificent: two watertight teams who couldn't find a way past one another, just the one goal (well, sort of) to separate them across 180 minutes plus stoppage time of chess-like posturing.\nNot the case four years later. The seesaw creaked between the two sides, with Liverpool going two goals ahead, Drogba and an Alex rocket dragging Chelsea back level in a double-salvo after the break, to set up a chaotic climax. Frank Lampard put the Blues ahead for the first time in the match, Lucas Leiva and Dirk Kuyt scored within two minutes of each other, before Lampard netted his second, Chelsea's fourth and the game's eighth in the embers of the madness.\nLiverpool triumphed in 2005 en route to a Champions League title, setting this rivalry up as one of the 2000s' most exhilarating in Europe. Chelsea got their own back in some fashion in 2009.\n14. Chelsea 4-2 Barcelona, 2004/05\nThe birth of two rivalries – Chelsea vs Barcelona and Jose Mourinho vs football. After a 2-1 first-leg defeat at the Camp Nou where Didier Drogba was sent off, Mourinho accused Barça counterpart Frank Rijkaard of going into referee Anders Frisk’s room at half-time for a little chat. The Swede later received death threats and soon quit football.\nBut Chelsea made a fine start in the return leg, as Eidur Gudjohnsen, Frank Lampard and Damien Duff sent them 3-0 up after 20 minutes. Ronaldinho pulled one back 10 minutes later, then conjured the most magical moment of the tie.\nAndres Iniesta shifted the ball to the Brazilian, then hurtled towards the box expecting to get it back. But Ronaldinho instead poked the ball beyond a hoard of players and Petr Cech into the bottom corner. Chelsea trailed on away goals, but a John Terry header sent the Blues through before chaos ensued with a Barça tunnel scrap.\n13. Liverpool 3-1 Olympiakos, 2004/05\nThe Miracle of Istanbul was still to come - but it was already a minor miracle that Liverpool got there in the first place after going oh-so-close to crashing out in the group stage.\nRafa Benitez's side needed to beat Olympiacos by two clear goals at Anfield to avoid going out on head-to-head record, and suffered a major setback when Rivaldo scored midway through the first half.\nSo who do you turn to when the chips are down? Florent Sinama Pongolle and Neil Mellor, of course. The Frenchman equalised within two minutes of his introduction from the bench at half time, and Neil Mellor did exactly the same after coming on in the 78 minute.\nLiverpool still needed one more goal to go through, and...well, you know the rest. 'Gerraaaard!'\n12. Barcelona 3-1 Manchester United, 2010/11\nWill a team ever play as well as this ever again? This was the pinnacle for Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona, who dismantled Manchester United in the final with their unmatchable trademark style.\nPedro’s cool finish put the Catalans 1-0 up at Wembley, only for Wayne Rooney to steer in an equaliser. But then Barça cranked through the gears: Lionel Messi surged forward to regain the lead, before David Villa curled home a delightful third past Edwin van der Sar from distance. Breathtaking.\n11. Real Madrid 2-1 Bayern Munich, 2023/24\nBayern Munich looked to be in control prior during semi-final second leg against Real Madrid, especially given they led at the Bernebau thanks to Alphonso Davies' opener that silence the home fans.\nWith the scored at 3-2 on aggregate, 1-0 on the night, up stepped hero Joeslu who etched his name into Real Madrid folklore with a stunning double that left Bayern's players in utter disbelief.\nReacting the quickest after Manuel Neuer's uncharacteristic mistake from Vincius Jr's shot, Joeslu restored parity in the game, and the tie, with his 88th-minute strike, but even more chaos was on the way.\nTwo minutes later, the former Stoke City man swept home Antonio Rudiger's square pass and the roof lifted off the Madridsta's fabled home, sending them on the way to the Champions League final, where they eventually beat Borussia Dortmund at Wembley.\n- 1\n- 2\nCurrent page: The 25 best Champions League games of all time: 25-11\nNext Page The 25 best Champions League games of all time: 10-1You must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name.",
