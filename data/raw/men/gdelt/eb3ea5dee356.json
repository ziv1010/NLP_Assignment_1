  "body_text": "•Lookman, Boniface, Chukwueze advance as Nigerian trio crash out\nNigerian players experienced contrasting fortunes in Wednesday night’s UEFA Champions League matches, as the group stage concluded with several dramatic encounters that determined their European fates, PETER AKINBO writes\nAtalanta (Ademola Lookman)\nAfrican Footballer of The Year Ademola Lookman was forced to watch from home as Atalanta secured a vital 2-2 draw at Barcelona’s Camp Nou. The Serie A club confirmed their talisman had suffered a lateral joint injury to his right knee in training, a significant blow given his impressive return of 14 goals and six assists this season.\nThe Italians showed remarkable resilience in their star man’s absence, twice coming from behind in a pulsating encounter. After having Davide Zappacosta’s 36th-minute effort ruled out for offside, they fell behind to Lamine Yamal’s strike shortly after the restart. However, Ederson levelled in the 67th minute, and though Ronald Araujo restored Barcelona’s lead, Mario Pasalic’s 79th-minute equaliser secured Atalanta ninth place and a playoff spot.\nBayer Leverkusen (Boniface, Tella)\nThere were contrasting fortunes for Leverkusen’s Nigerian contingent at the BayArena. While Victor Boniface was absent amid intensifying transfer speculation – with Sky Sports reporting the striker has completed a medical with Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr – Nathan Tella enjoyed a night to remember against Sparta Prague.\nThe German champions, who had won all but one of their previous 13 matches, dominated from the outset. Florian Wirtz’s clever finish from Jeremie Frimpong’s assist gave them a 32nd-minute lead before Tella crowned a perfect evening with the second goal in the 64th minute. The 2-0 victory ensured Xabi Alonso’s side finished sixth, securing automatic qualification for the round of 16.\nClub Brugge (Raphael Onyedika)\nRaphael Onyedika’s finest moment in European football ultimately proved bittersweet at the Etihad Stadium. The Nigerian midfielder appeared to have written himself into Club Brugge folklore when he fired the Belgians ahead in the 45th minute, a goal that briefly had them dreaming of extending their remarkable 20-match unbeaten run.\nHowever, Manchester City demonstrated their superior qualities after the break. Mateo Kovacic levelled in the 53rd minute before Joel Ordonez’s own goal turned the tide. Savinho’s 77th-minute strike completed a 3-1 victory for the hosts, though Brugge’s earlier impressive performances – including points against Juventus, Aston Villa, Celtic and Sporting Lisbon – ensured they claimed 24th place and the final playoff berth.\nAC Milan (Samuel Chukwueze)\nAC Milan’s hopes of securing automatic qualification unravelled in dramatic fashion in Zagreb. Samuel Chukwueze, fresh from his heroics in the weekend’s 3-2 victory over Parma, started on the bench as the seven-time European champions sought a sixth straight Champions League win.\nThose ambitions suffered an early setback when Martin Baturina fired Dinamo ahead in the 19th minute, before Yunus Musah’s 39th-minute dismissal left the Rossoneri facing an uphill battle.\nChukwueze’s introduction at half-time briefly sparked hope as Christian Pulisic equalised in the 53rd minute, but Marko Pjaca’s strike condemned Sergio Conceicao’s side to a 2-1 defeat. The result saw Milan finish 13th, securing a playoff spot but missing out on automatic progression despite their recent impressive form.\nSparta Prague (Victor Olatunji)\nVictor Olatunji’s European adventure with Sparta Prague ended in disappointment at the BayArena. The striker, who started brightly in the competition during September’s 3-0 win against Red Bull Salzburg as the first Nigerian to score and assist in a UCL game, received a 63rd-minute yellow card as his side fell to Leverkusen.\nThe Czech outfit’s early promise, which included a creditable draw with Stuttgart, ultimately faded as they finished 31st, having lost five consecutive matches and conceded four or more goals in three of those games.\nCrvena Zvezda (Peter Olayinka)\nRed Star Belgrade found some consolation in Peter Olayinka’s continued absence, securing a 1-0 victory over Young Boys through Guelor Kanga’s 69th-minute strike. The Nigerian forward, who contributed two goals and two assists in six appearances before suffering an Achilles injury against Monaco, faces a lengthy rehabilitation period following surgery in Finland.\nHis recovery timeline, estimated between six and nine months, means he’s unlikely to feature again this season as Red Star finished 29th.\nYoung Boys (Zachary Athekame)\nSwiss-born Nigerian youth international Zachary Athekame’s challenging European initiation concluded without reward at the Stadion Wankdorf. The 20-year-old, who earned his first Switzerland U-21 cap in September, was part of a Young Boys side that endured a disastrous campaign, losing all eight matches to finish bottom of the 36-team table. The stark contrast between their domestic dominance – having won six of the last seven Swiss Super League titles – and European struggles proved particularly striking.\nThe group stage’s conclusion painted a varied picture for Nigeria’s Champions League representatives. Leverkusen emerged as the highest-placed team featuring Nigerian talent, securing automatic qualification in sixth. Atalanta and Milan will contest the playoffs, while Club Brugge scraped through in 24th place despite their late defeat. For Sparta Prague, Red Star Belgrade and Young Boys, attention now turns to domestic competitions following their eliminations.",
