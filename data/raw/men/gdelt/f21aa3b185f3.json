  "body_text": "Tonight, Manchester United are set to play what is undoubtedly the most crucial match of their season: the UEFA Europa League final.\nAs soon as they take to the pitch at the Estadio de San Mamés to face Premier League rivals Tottenham Hotspur, Man United must realise that there is far more on the line than just an impressive piece of silverware.\nNot only is Europa League victory their only pathway into next season’s Champions League, or any European football at all for that matter, but a win would also deliver United a cool £10.95m in prize money, which would give the club a massive financial boost as it looks to complete some crucial transfers in what will be a massive summer rebuild.\nBut before United can begin to dream of the celebrations that will follow their victory, manager Ruben Amorim needs to face some harsh realities if he is to get his team over the line.\nIn the tactical analysis piece leading up to last weekend’s 1-0 loss at Chelsea, The Peoples Person noted how United appeared lethargic on the attack during their previous league game, namely an embarrassing 2-0 loss to West Ham United at home.\nSadly, this lack of drive has been all too common in United’s league campaign, with the team yet again lacking all sense of urgency in the Chelsea defeat.\nApart from Harry Maguire’s opening goal that was ruled offside, United appeared unmotivated throughout the rest of the match, barely even attempting to claw their way back into the contest by the time Chelsea broke the deadlock.\nPerformances such as these have become a painful common occurrence at Old Trafford, with United fans getting far too used to watching their team drop points.\nWeirdly enough, United appear to be a completely different team in Europe, especially when one reflects on their most recent Europa League matches.\nIn the quarter-finals against Olympique Lyonnais, United arrived with a fire in their belly, scoring five goals in the second leg to spark a dramatic comeback in extra time that will live on in fans’ memories.\nSure, they shouldn’t have lost a two-goal lead at home, but what mattered most is that Amorim’s team remained steadfast in their hunt for victory, refusing to take their foot off the gas as they sought passage into the semi-finals.\nDuring the next round, when they faced Athletic Club, United appeared far more in control, earning a resounding 7-1 victory over the two legs.\nWhile the team cannot reasonably be expected to maintain their concentration throughout each match without fail, their defence was largely composed, making minimal errors, while their attacking lineup remained constantly hungry for more goals. Overall, it was an incredibly professional performance.\nBut even after such impressive showings, it’s important to note that the games against Athletic were outliers in United’s season.\nFar too often, Amorim’s side has had to play catch-up after conceding early in games. What’s more, it has often taken some witty substitutions to change the tide, with the team often having to pull itself out from the abyss late in the second half, as we saw in the 1-1 draw with Bournemouth, with the same thing almost happening against Brentford. Of course, the Lyon game was another example of this.\nAlthough Tottenham Hotspur have had an even worse season than United, sitting in 17th place in the Premier League, their attack has been far more clinical on a consistent basis.\nSpurs have scored 63 goals in the league – 21 more than United – while also proving dangerous up top throughout their Europa League journey. It has been their defence that has let them down.\nAnge Postecoglou’s side defeated Manchester City 4-0 away from home earlier this season while scoring three goals against Chelsea in a narrow 3-4 loss. They also scored three goals in what was a thrilling 3-6 defeat to Liverpool back in December. (Transfermarkt)\nWhat such results prove is that Spurs are capable of scoring multiple goals against the toughest of opponents – something that United must be aware of.\nThis makes it abundantly clear that for United to have any chance to win tonight’s game, they cannot afford to be subdued up top, no matter how in control they may feel at any point in the match.\nOn far too many occasions, United have been forced to play catch-up. Far too often this season, United’s low-energy attack has undone the hard work put in by their defence.\nAmorim must ensure that from the very first moment his team takes to the field, they come out swinging, hungry to find the back of the net as many times as possible. Because even if we establish a comfortable lead, it’s possible to lose that advantage, as we’ve learned the hard way.\nJust as Spurs’ defence has proven to be incredibly vulnerable, United’s attack has shown that they have the potential to inflict massive damage when they step up to the plate. If ever there was a time for United leave their hearts on the pitch, it would be tonight. Let’s do this.\nFeatured image Ion Alcoba Beitia via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
