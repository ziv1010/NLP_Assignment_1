He will want an instant return on his hefty investment at Stamford Bridge while Tottenham, back in the Champions League, will want to kick on once more too.\nIt's not all about the action at the top though with Fulham, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest promoted to the top tier for 2021/22 and hoping to hold their own against the best English football has to offer and avoid the drop.\nWe will bring you all the action and updates from today's game in the live blog below:\nBournemouth vs Leeds LIVE: Premier League updates\nBOU XI - Neto, Smith, Kelly, Senesi, Vina, Lerma, Rothwell, Billing, Outtara, Christie, Solanke\nLEE XI - Meslier, Ayling, Koch, Cooper, Kristensen, Roca, McKennie, Summerville, Gnonto, Harrison, Bamford\nGoal - Lerma curls in the opener (1-0)\nGoal - Meslier flaps at a corner and Lerma buries another (2-0)\nGoal - Bamford heads in on the half-hour mark to pull one back (2-1)\nGoal - Solanke puts daylight between the teams (3-1)\nGoal - Semenyo scores after another Meslier error (4-1)\nAFC Bournemouth 4 - 1 Leeds United FC\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n16:20\nMood = Jeff ❤️ pic.twitter.com/Nykk7uzLoy\n— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) April 30, 2023\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n16:10\nYeaaaaah man 🤙🤙 pic.twitter.com/4qLIhpbGVs\n— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) April 30, 2023\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n16:05\nThat's all from Bournemouth today, so thank you for joining us and goodbye!\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n16:04\nWhile Bournemouth, who have moved onto 39 points by picking up three more today, next meet Chelsea at the Vitality Stadium, Leeds' upcoming fixtures pitch them against Manchester City and Newcastle United - a sobering thought for their supporters.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n16:01\nCapitalising on an abject defensive display from their ailing visitors, Bournemouth take another huge stride towards safety with a three-goal home win - their fourth Premier League victory in five matches. Lerma's first-half double was followed by goals from Solanke and Semenyo after the break, as Leeds crumbled under the pressure once again. They are now facing a four-game scrap for survival, while the Cherries are surely staying up.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:58\nFULL-TIME: BOURNEMOUTH 4-1 LEEDS UNITED\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:57\nBoth Outtara and Lerma linger too long on chances to strike from the edge of the Leeds area. The Whites are in disarray now, and it's difficult to see how they can recover from this setback in the coming weeks.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:57\n— Leeds United (@LUFC) April 30, 2023\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:56\nTHREE MORE POINTS ❤️ pic.twitter.com/nPMkDi27NJ\n— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) April 30, 2023\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:52\nIT'S FOURRRRRR ❤️\nAnthony feeds Semenyo and the winger does the rest with a cool, calm finish beyond Meslier.\nThis team 🤌\n90+2' | 🍒 4-1 ⚪️ // #BOULEE https://t.co/mcXqyLI8NH— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) April 30, 2023\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:52\nAssist Jaidon Anthony\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:51\nGoal Antoine Serlom Semenyo\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:51\n90+1' Goal Bournemouth.

Surely, their race is run.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:45\nNot long after coming on from the bench, Moore has sustained an injury - it does not look good for the Bournemouth striker, who seems set to be replaced.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:45\nCLOSE! Lerma steals the ball deep in Leeds territory, but then opts against trying for a hat-trick. When the ball is recycled and is sent in from the right, Moore's diving header misses the target by a whisker!\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:43\nWe're forced into another change as Moore goes off...\n⬅️ Moore\n➡️ Semenyo\nHope it's nothing serious, Kieffer 🙏\n82' | 🍒 3-1 ⚪️ // #BOULEE pic.twitter.com/8CTCEFOAFT— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) April 30, 2023\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:43\nSubstitution Kieffer Roberto Francisco Moore Antoine Serlom Semenyo\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:42\nMoore is inches away...\nCook's ball into the box lands perfectly on Moore's head, but the striker's effort goes just over 😩\n79' | 🍒 3-1 ⚪️ // #BOULEE— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) April 30, 2023\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:42\nDefending with great determination, Anthony deals well with the threat of Summerville on the edge of his own area, drawing a foul and earning his side a free-kick to both ease the pressure and eat up a little more time.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:40\nOver the last 15 minutes, Leeds have had 83 per cent of possession and 43 per cent of the action has been in Bournemouth's defensive third. They are throwing everything at their hosts now.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:37\nDOUBLE STOP! Again, Neto preserves his team's advantage. The Bournemouth skipper first punches away a close-range header by Koch, then Gnonto's follow-up is saved in the bottom-right corner! Great goalkeeping!\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:34\nMore movement on the bench...\n⬅️ Rothwell\n➡️ Cook\nAnother superb shift, Joe 👏\n74' | 🍒 3-1 ⚪️ // #BOULEE pic.twitter.com/uJMjPK1Y0C— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) April 30, 2023\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:34\nSAVE! Alert to the danger, Neto has to dive down to his left in order to parry away Roca's stinging shot from the edge of the box!\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:34\nSubstitution Joseph Matthew Rothwell Lewis John Cook\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:31\nLeeds look deflated by their latest setback, and Gracia is deep in discussion with his staff on the bench. Can anything be done to salvage something from this game? It certainly seems bleak for the visitors now.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:31\nBeautiful 😘 pic.twitter.com/HkWZRJD8Aq\n— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) April 30, 2023\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:31\nSubstitution Weston James Earl McKennie Adam John Forshaw\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:31\nSubstitution Patrick James Bamford Rodrigo Moreno Machado\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:29\nGOAL STANDS! A prolonged pause while the VAR reviewes whether Solanke's goal would be ruled out for offside ends with a roar of approval from the home fans: Bournemouth's third goal stands!\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:26\nIt's a lovely finish from Dom! 💫\nOuattara crosses it in from the right-hand side and Solanke is there. He takes a touch and finishes from an acute angle 😍\nCOME ONNNNNNNN ❤️\n64' | 🍒 3-1 ⚪️ // #BOULEE https://t.co/kVEku8Zm4o— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) April 30, 2023\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:24\n63' Goal Bournemouth.

After Ayling rises highest on the right side of the Bournemouth box, his nod-down reaches Gnonto, who can only place his own header wide of the left-hand post from close range!\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:22\nSubstitution Philip Anyanwu Billing Kieffer Roberto Francisco Moore\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:22\nSubstitution Matías Nicolás Viña Susperreguy Jaidon Anthony\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:22\nMISS! Outtara and Chrisite combine on the right side of the area, before the latter's cross is stood up invitingly for Billing at the back post. He attempts an ambitious bicycle kick, but barely makes contact and spurns a great chance for Bournemouth to score a third!\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:20\nSo close from Billing 😩\nOuattara keeps the ball in play and finds Christie. His cross picks out Billing at the back-post, but the midfielder can't divert home.\nKeep it going, lads 💪\n59' | 🍒 2-1 ⚪️ // #BOULEE— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) April 30, 2023\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:20\nAnother stray pass from Outtara results in Bournemouth's latest attempted attack fizzling out. Despite already having two goals in the bag, the Cherries have been quite careless in possession inside the final third today.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:16\nRather stiffly, Harrison returns to the action, which has already resumed.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:16\nYellow Card Adam James Smith\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:14\nAdding to Gracia's injury woes, Harrison is now down on the deck with what seems to be a hip problem. The game comes to a halt while he receives treatment.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:13\nAfter Leeds' corner reaches Summerville, whose shot on the turn is blocked behind, Billing is then on hand to head away a second set-piece at the back post.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:12\nWonderfully deft movement by Gnonto leaves three defenders for dead, opening up space on the left for Leeds. Ultimately, the visitors' move results in a corner-kick out on the right.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:09\nEarly Bournemouth pressure sees Christie have a shot blocked on the edge of the area, before Outtara's wayward cross eases the pressure on Leeds' back line.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:06\nLeeds kick off, and we are back under way at the Vitality Stadium!\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:05\nBack underway for the second half...\nCOME ON, LADS 🔥\n46' | 🍒 2-1 ⚪️ // #BOULEE pic.twitter.com/XZKzoHE0su— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) April 30, 2023\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n15:03\nLeeds not only have a record of W1, D1, L8 when trailing at half-time in the Premier League this season, but only Nottingham Forest have won fewer away points than them to date. It will take something special, then, to turn things around during the second half in Bournemouth.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:57\nDespite a frenetic first half at the Vitality Stadium featuring just six shots on target, three have found the net, and Bournemouth lead by a goal at the break. There has been little between the teams so far, with Lerma's clinical finishing earning the Cherries their half-time advantage. Leeds have been bright enough going forward, and their one moment of real quality from Gnonto split the hosts' defence and found Bamford for a goal which gives them hope of fighting back after the interval.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:52\nHALF-TIME: BOURNEMOUTH 2-1 LEEDS UNITED\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:52\nFollowing Harrison's inswinging free-kick from the right touchline, the ball falls to Ayling, who swipes at it wildly and sends his shot spinning far over the crossbar.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:51\nIn the closing stages of additional time, Leeds have Bournemouth penned into their defensive third, and Christie's foul on Ayling offers them a chance to deliver into the box from the right.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:50\nSo far, so good 🙌 pic.twitter.com/FuMp9U6ZC1\n— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) April 30, 2023\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:49\nThere are to be at least four minutes of stoppage time at the end of this first half. An enforced substitution and three goals account for that.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:47\nThe game has become ever more disjointed, with either side willing to toss hopeful balls forward and also rushing in possession. Given the relegation picture, it's high-stakes stuff on the south coast, so perhaps that's understandable.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:46\nWith commendable confidence, Neto sidesteps a fast-closing Bamford on the edge of his six-yard box, then picks out a team-mate with his subsequent pass.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:44\nBournemouth's momentum has been disrupted since seeing their lead cut, and they can't exert any control on the game now. O'Neil appears increasingly agitated on the touchline.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:43\nFollowing Bamford's strike, Bournemouth have not only conceded 35 first-half goals in 34 games so far - more than any other team in the Premier League this season - but they have also shipped 13 in the final 15 minutes of the first half too.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:41\nAnother Leeds attack peters out, as they are denied a free-kick claim and then a corner on the left byline. Still, they are very much in this game and could yet equalise before the break.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:35\nSubstitution Liam David Ian Cooper Maximilian Wöber\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:33\nBamford pulls one back!

Can the home side now hold onto their two-goal advantage, at least until the half-time break?\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:30\nThe action is paused temporarily, as Chrsitie has sustained an injury and requires attention from the medics.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:29\nA chant of \"We are staying up!\" echoes around the Vitality Stadium, as Bournemouth's fans believe another Premier League season could soon be confirmed. Leeds, meanwhile, must be in despair - they had started the game brightly before crumbling so spectacularly.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:27\nVAMOSSSSSSSSSS 💪 pic.twitter.com/EvIwLrIap2\n— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) April 30, 2023\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:26\nLERMA SMASHES IT HOME 💥\nChristie's ball in isn't cleared by Meslier and Lerma reacts quickest, firing his shot into the top of the net 🚀\nGET IN THERE 👏👏\n25' | 🍒 2-0 ⚪️ // #BOULEE https://t.co/WOdnRNrCkQ— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) April 30, 2023\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:25\n24' Goal for Bournemouth.

The visitors are closing down their hosts with great commitment.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:17\nLeeds are certainly looking the more incisive side at the moment, as numerous white shirts flood Bournemouth's defensive third. Gracia will be quite pleased with how his team have started, considering their dire record on the road this season.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:14\nA surging run from the right by Gnonto ends with the Italian striker laying the ball off to Harrison, who shoots first time from the left side of the box but hits one of three defenders blocking his route to goal.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:13\nWith Outtara now back in the fold, Bournemouth build some attacking momentum, but Solanke's claims for a free-kick just outside the Leeds area are ignored by the referee.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:11\nOnly called up to replace injury victim Tavernier, now Outtara is struggling with a knock. The game comes to a temporary halt as the Cherries winger peels himself of the turf and hobbles over to the touchline.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:09\nSAVE! It is Roca who steps up to the set-piece, but after he sees his low curling effort sneak through a crumbling defensive wall, Neto is on hand to parry the ball away!\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:08\nNO PENALTY! After a review of the evidence, the VAR decides that Vina's handball offence took place just outside the area. Instead, Leeds have a close-range free-kick!\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:06\nPENALTY FOR LEEDS? After Summerville plays in Bamford on the edge of the Bournemouth box, the latter's flicked return strikes the outstretched arm of Vina. The VAR is already assessing if the visitors will have an early penalty-kick!\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:05\nImbued with confidence from posting their third win in four during the week, Bournemouth keep possession in the early stages and Leeds are mostly consigned to their own half.\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:02\nThe hosts kick off, and we are under way in Bournemouth!\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:01\n👊 COME ON, LADS!! #LUFC pic.twitter.com/CmKPmV9qna\n— Leeds United (@LUFC) April 30, 2023\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n14:01\nWe're underway at Vitality Stadium...\nUTCIAD 🔥🔥\n1' | 🍒 0-0 ⚪️ // #BOULEE— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) April 30, 2023\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n13:58\nThe players are out on the pitch at the Vitality Stadium, and kick-off is now just moments away!\nAFC Bournemouth vs Leeds United\n13:53\nAfter Luis Sinisterra was withdrawn with a season-ending ankle injury in midweek - joining Tyler Adams and Stuart Dallas on the Leeds United treatment table - Gnonto starts for the visitors today.
