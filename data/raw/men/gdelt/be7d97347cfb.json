It’s a deceptively simple question, but ranking the top 25 legends of Spain’s top flight requires more than just goals and trophies.\nFrom the golden era of Alfredo Di Stéfano and Francisco Gento to the recent reign of Lionel Messi and Karim Benzema, La Liga has produced some of the most iconic footballers ever to play the game.\nThis ranking dives deep into the best players in La Liga of all time, factoring in longevity, influence, technical brilliance, and historical context. We’re not just listing the top La Liga goal scorers or the most decorated names — we’re asking who truly defined eras and shaped Spanish football across decades.\nWhether it’s midfield magicians like Xavi and Iniesta or cult heroes like Quini, this is the definitive guide for fans searching for the greatest La Liga players ever ranked from 25 to 1.\n25. Barcelona ST David Villa\nBarcelona have given the world so many incredible strikers over the years, and David Villa absolutely belongs on that list. In fact, Barca were at their best with Villa at striker compared to the other excellent options they had around that time, because the all-time leading World Cup scorer for Spain had both the finishing chops and the willingness and ability to maneuver gracefully across the front three to maximize the firepower of a certain Lionel Messi.\nOf course, Villa could shine as the main man on his own, too, as he was already a world-class striker at Valencia before making the jump to rivals Barcelona. Villa won two league titles and a Champions League with Barcelona, but he also won the Copa del Rey with three different clubs – Barca, Valencia, and Real Zaragoza.\n24. Atletico Madrid FW Antoine Griezmann\nThe rise of Atletico Madrid from a dusty neighbor to Real Madrid to a legitimate Champions League title contender actually came just before Antoine Griezmann’s arrival from Real Sociedad, but the legendary Frenchman’s impact on Atleti and overall playmaking and goal-scoring quality cannot be understated.\nYes, he flopped at Barcelona with the gargantuan presence of another left-footed wizard overshadowing him, but he was still hitting 20 goal contributions. Griezmann never won a single La Liga title, though, missing both windows of Atleti taking home the crown, but his numbers and play on the pitch speak for themselves. After all, there’s a reason why he was named to four La Liga Team of the Seasons at a time when he was competing for spots with MSN and BBC.\n23. Barcelona AM Ronaldinho\nThe man who received a standing ovation from the Santiago Bernabeu faithful, Ronaldinho could electrify crowds like nobody else before him in La Liga – and there have been arguably more legendary figures in the Spanish top flight than in any other league throughout history.\nRonaldinho only spent a handful of years in Catalunya, but the impact of those years has stood the test of time. His highlight reel is probably the best in the history of La Liga after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, and he was named FIFA World Footballer of the Year in back-to-back years – 2004 and 2005 – while at Barca.\n22. Barcelona ST Rivaldo\nYet the best Brazilian icon at Barcelona of them all was Rivaldo, who also spent a short period of time with the club – literally the period of five years before Ronaldinho’s arrival.\nRivaldo pretty much carried Barcelona on his back around that time, and even as the world was focused on the Galacticos, Rivaldo was playing at a higher level than all of them, and he was actually the Ballon d’Or winner the year before Figo captured the prize.\n21. Real Madrid FW Luis Figo\nObviously, Luis Figo began his La Liga career with Barcelona before his infamous move to Real Madrid, and he was actually tremendous with the Blaugrana, leading the league in assists once before making his move to Real Madrid in 2000 at the literal peak of his powers.\nDuring that transition year from Barca to Madrid in 2000, Figo won the Ballon d’Or and then was FIFA World Player of the Year a year later. Figo would lead La Liga and the Champions League in assists two more times at Real Madrid, and when you compare all the Galacticos, he was, by far, the most consistent and best one overall despite receiving a fraction of the attention of the other three.\n20. Real Madrid LB Marcelo\nThere’s often a debate between Roberto Carlos and Marcelo for which Brazilian left back at Real Madrid is the greatest attacking left back of all time (Paolo Maldini has the defense covered), but when you stack up what Marcelo achieved at Real, there should be no debate.\nHe ranks higher on this list than some massive names because of his longevity and ability to affect his team’s success. Marcelo was indispensible for Real Madrid and responsible for so many world-class assists and progressions of the ball to support Cristiano Ronaldo on the left flank. He didn’t win six La Liga titles and five Champions League crowns by accident.\n19. Barcelona ST Luis Suarez\nLionel Messi with Luis Suarez was just different gravy, and that 2014/15 Barcelona side that blew through world football with one of the most convincing trebles in the modern game was a different brand of attacking dominance entirely.\nSuarez was one of the most exciting players in world football at that time, scoring a bevy of outstanding individual goals, linking up with Neymar and Messi for some of the all-time great team goals, and even sacrificing his own stats for the betterment of the wingers alongside him.\nIn six seasons with the Blaugrana, Suarez won four league titles and four Copas despite going up against an insanely good Real Madrid – and a pretty darn good Atletico Madrid to boot. And after winning all that there was to win for Barca, Suarez proved he wasn’t finished by carrying Atleti to an unlikely league title with a last-gasp winner in the final minutes of the last matchday to sink Real Madrid hearts. That 21-goal miracle season alone is worth a higher ranking on this list.\n18. Real Madrid LW Paco Gento\nOne of the best wingers in the history of world football, Paco Gento dominated the 1950s and 60s and set the tone for Real Madrid becoming the biggest brand in the sport, as he and Alfredo Di Stefano have stood the test of time as La Liga’s greatest ever attacking one-two punch (with all due respect to CR7 and KB9 or Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez).\nGento won a staggering 12 La Liga titles and six European Cups as a member of Real Madrid, and there isn’t a single player in the league’s history with more league crowns than the speedy wide creator.\n17. Sporting Gijon ST Quini\nAnother legend of La Liga’s past, Quini bagged a blistering 301 goals in 563 career appearances with more than 200 goals coming with Sporting Gijon. While he had a fruitful few years with giants Barcelona, Quini is most famous for his time with Gijon and is the underdog club’s greatest player of all time.\nQuini won the Segunda twice with Gijon before upgrading his trophy cabinet with two Copas del Rey in Barcelona. As an individual, Quini’s goal-scoring prowess is almost unrivaled, as he secured the Pichichi trophy an astounding five times in La Liga (with an additional two in the Segunda).\n16. Real Madrid ST Ferenc Puskas\nThe man they literally named the award for the best goal of the year after, Ferenc Puskas is both the greatest Hungarian player of all time and one of the greatest strikers in the history of the game.\nReal Madrid’s cabinet of legendary strikers is perhaps the greatest of any club ever, and with 156 goals in only 180 games for the Merengues, Puskas 100 percent has a seat at the table.\nThe iconic No. 9 won five league titles and four Pichichi trophies individually for the capital club, twice leading all of Europe in goals. Puskas would also win three European Cups as a member of the all-time champions of European football.\n15. Real Madrid ST Hugo Sanchez\nHugo Sanchez once scored 38 goals in a league season. Now that’s impressive enough and has only ever been surpassed by one other Madridista, Cristiano Ronaldo himself, but what makes it even more outrageous is the fact that all 38 goals were scored with one touch. And if you watch them all back, they were far from easy tap-ins.\nThe Mexican international is, like Puskas, the greatest player of all time from his country. Only four players in La Liga history have scored more goals than Sanchez, who smashed home 164 in 207 games for Real Madrid alone after already nabbing 54 in 111 for rivals Atletico Madrid before that.\n14. Real Madrid GK Iker Casillas\nThibaut Courtois could one day join Iker Casillas on this list of great La Liga goalkeepers, and there’s an argument to be made that the former Atletico Madrid loane standout is an even better shot-stopper.\nBut that argument should not come at the disservice of honoring Casillas, who manned the sticks for 16 years, first making his mark as a heroic substitute in the 3-1 Champions League Final triumph over Bayer Leverkusen in 2002 that could have ended up very differently without him.\nBlessed with cat-like reflexes while rarely making a mistake, Casillas was Real’s vital leader as the club weathered a difficult 2000s, and there’s no dominant era of Madrid in the 2010s without Casillas, even though he would only be part of the Decima triumph.\n13. Barcelona DM Sergio Busquets\nSergio Busquets doesn’t have the statistical brilliance of the other players on this list, but the wiry anchor at the base of the Barcelona midfield was the unsung hero who made it all tick.\nWith Busquets in the XI, Xavi and Andres Iniesta were somehow even more unstoppable, which led to Lionel Messi also having an easier time tormenting defenses. Busquets could see plays develop minutes before everyone else, and he was like a coach on the pitch both in his understanding of the passing/possession game and his defensive reading.\n12. Athletic Club ST Telmo Zarra\nAthletic Club are one of the most historic clubs in La Liga history, and striker Telmo Zarra is their greatest ever player. The No. 9 won just won La Liga title, but that was more than enough to become a legend. Zarra also won five Copas for Bilbao and was a Pichichi winner six times.\nSo dominant was his pure goal-scoring for Athletic that the award for the highest-scoring Spanish player in La Liga is named the Zarra after him. Zarra has the most goals in La Liga of any Spanish player in history as well as the most Copa del Rey goals in history and the most Pichichi trophies won.\n11. Real Madrid CM Toni Kroos\nReal Madrid’s midfield general, Toni Kroos is the most cerebral tempo-setter in the history of the game, and he has five Champions League titles (and four La Liga title victories) to back that up.\nDespite totaling double-digit assists as a deep-lying playmaker in three distinct La Liga seasons, Kroos completed 90 percent of his passes for the Merengues, highlighting his ability to be progressive whilst also being nearly flawless.\nKroos retired from Real Madrid in 2023/24 at the top of his game as a Champions League winner and a legitimate Ballon d’Or candidate, and Real were unsurprisingly in disarray as a team in midfield without him in 2024/25.\n10. Real Madrid ST Karim Benzema\nA string of Real Madrid superstars of the 2010s continues with Karim Benzema, who was already worthy of being on this list for his elite all-around play and unselfishness and bringing the best out of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale during the three-peat era.\nBut he proved that he is one of the most talented players to ever grace this incredible league with a 2021/22 season for the ages. Already carrying an awful Real Madrid attack in the post-Cristiano era, Benzema finally had some real help from Vinicius Junior that year, and that was all he needed to forge an all-time great season, bringing Real Madrid back from the brink with a solo comeback in the second half of the second leg of the Champions League Round of 16 against Kylian Mbappe, Neymar, and ole foe Lionel Messi.\nBenzema was money all season long, capturing the easiest Ballon d’Or victory since Cristiano and Messi stopped fighting over the awards back-and-forth, and that season cemented Florentino Perez’s belief in the Ronaldo Nazario-inspired French No. 9 for all those years.\n9. Real Madrid CM Luka Modric\nIt’s remarkable to think that a player nearing the age of 40 was still a key player as a box-to-box midfielder for Real Madrid – of all clubs – but Lukita Modric is truly an ageless wonder.\nSpeaking of peak Messi and Ronaldo, Modric managed to nick the Ballon d’Or off both of them in 2018 as a true center midfield engine, which is a testatement to his quality.\nModric shone in short areas and was impossible to dispossess, turning tight corners into breakaway opportunities for Real Madrid. He excelled in possession, defensively, and as a creator, and he even has a nifty catalogue of outside-the-box (and outside-the-boot) bangers. La Liga won’t be the same without Modric.\n8. Barcelona CM Andres Iniesta\nAs with so many of the world’s finest midfielders, Andres Iniesta’s numbers do not do justice to the dominant force that he was at Barcelona. Both and Xavi had the entire world in a chokehold for club and country, yet they dominated not by brute force, but by brains and the kinds of delicate touches that only La Masia could forge.\nIniesta emerged as a phenom in the Barcelona midfield in the early to mid-2000s and eventually blossomed into one of the most feared players in the 2010s, conquering World Cups and Champions Leagues alike as a six-time UEFA Team of the Year superstar.\n7. Real Madrid ST Raul\nEver the gentleman, Raul, a homegrown striker with the keenest of goal-scoring instincts, ended up being the biggest superstar and most beloved Real Madrid player in the 2000s – not Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo Nazario, or Luis Figo. And don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.\nMichael Owen, a future Real Madrid flop, winning the Ballon d’Or over Raul is the greatest travesty in the history of this disturbingly tainted award, but literally every La Liga observer of the last 30 years will tell you that Raul – a consummate professional on a team filled with indolent and overpaid superstars – was a different class. And even his opponents will tell you that he was a cut above the rest of his more adulated Real Madrid men. Or just ask Claude Makelele how he felt about Raul.\n6. Barcelona FW Johan Cruyff\nThe original false nine and the originator of Total Football, John Cruyff was already arguably the world’s best player before he joined Barcelona in 1973, and he would immediately lift Barca.\nFans would pour in with admiration for Cruyff, and he brought an air of excitement around Barcelona and a new way of playing that would forever become the identity of the club.\nCruyff won back-to-back Ballons d’Or upon his arrival in Catalunya and then nearly won a third, finishing silver on the podium. The Dutchman spent just a handful of years with Barcelona and brought them just one league title, but he was so effective individually and so influential overall that he is easily one of the greatest players in the history of La Liga.\n5. Barcelona CM Xavi\nThere are two kinds of people in this world: people who tell you that Xavi is the greatest midfielder in La Liga history and people who are lying. Xavi redefined possession-based football as Pep Guardiola’s midfield executor. He was the heir to Guardiola’s Barcelona midfield and would easily surpass his master, stringing together patterns of play that left opponents spellbound.\nXavi could take the most innocent-seeming touch and turn nothing into an attack straight out of a textbook written by La Masia. His telepathic connection with Iniesta destroyed worlds, and his ability to navigate out of any level of traffic and then spray the ball wide to the world-class forwards was the hallmark of Barca.\nIn the end, Xavi won eight La Liga titles, four Champions Leagues, and made five UEFA Teams of the Year as a three-time La Liga Midfielder of the Year. And if you ask anyone who watched him at the time, he was actually underrated by his contemporaries and only truly appreciated when Spain won the World Cup in 2010.\n4. Real Madrid CB Sergio Ramos\nSergio Ramos is ranked alongside Paolo Maldini and Franz Beckenbauer as the greatest center back of all time – and not even behind them – which should tell you all you need to know about where he should stand among the all-time greats at any position in La Liga.\nA world-class right back who was rated the best overall player at the 2010 World Cup when La Roja won it all, Ramos transitioned back to his natural position at center back at both Real Madrid and Spain, becoming all he could be as a leader, goal-scoring machine, and defensive maestro.\nRamos’s lion-heart could carry Real Madrid past any challenge, and he is responsible for some of the most clutch moments in the club’s history, including the eternally beloved 92:48 goal against Atletico Madrid to vault Real to “La Decima”.\nAs good of a passer as the best midfielders in La Liga and a better defender than anyone else, Ramos, if anything, was often underappreciated because of his hot-headed antics. It was only towards the end that his quality became more appreciated, and now that he’s gone, Madridistas miss him dearly.\n3. Real Madrid FW Alfredo Di Stefano\nBefore Cristiano Ronaldo, Alfredo Di Stefano was the undisputed GOAT of GOATs at Real Madrid, and, to this day, there are hardcore Madridistas, especially in Spain, who will swear that the Argentinian international is the club’s greatest ever legend. And funny enough, Florentino Perez would be one of them.\nDi Stefano was so good that he could play just about anywhere on the pitch. He was teammates with some of the greatest players of all time like Paco Gento, Ferenc Puskas, and Raymond Kopa, and yet he was so good that there was no debate that ADS was the best of them all at Real Madrid.\nThe Blond Arrow would win eight La Liga titles, five European Cups, five Pichichi trophies, and two Ballons d’Or as one of only four players in La Liga history to win the award more than once.\n2. Real Madrid LW Cristiano Ronaldo\nNo player in La Liga history has averaged more goals per game than Cristiano Ronaldo’s 1.07. He is responsible for bringing Real Madrid out of the stench of the failed Galacticos era and a post-Galacticos period that put Madrid in purgatory.\nThe club went from being record champions in Europe to a side that could scarcely get out of the first round of the knockout stages. With Cristiano coming over as someone with a Ballon d’Or and Champions League to his name already, Real Madrid were catapulted back to record status, with the club winning four Champions League titles in five years – including a rare three-peat.\nCristiano was unmistakably the face of the team, producing almost unheard of goals and being the face of one of the greatest counterattacking and big-game sides of all time. There’s almost no sense in extolling the footballing virtues of an athlete so uniquely gifted and hard-working.\n1. Barcelona RW Lionel Messi\nCristiano is the greatest goal-scorer in the history of La Liga, but Lionel Messi, who so often got the better of the Portuguese legend head-to-head, is the Spanish top flight’s greatest player.\nHis combination of goal-scoring and playmaking is what sets him apart, as Messi is one of only two players since assists have been reliably recorded to notch at least 20 goals and 20 assists in a single league season.\nMessi won a ridiculous 10 La Liga titles, seven Copas del Rey, and even four Champions Leagues. He won seven Ballons d’Or as a Barcelona player, six European Golden Shoes, and eight Pichichi trophies to Cristiano’s three.\nJoe Soriano is the editor of The Trivela Effect and a FanSided Hall of Famer who has covered world football since 2010.
