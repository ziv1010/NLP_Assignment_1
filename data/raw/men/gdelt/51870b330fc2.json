They understand our style, embrace the demands, and bring the kind of presence that lifts standards. Extending their contracts is a big step towards building continuity, raising the bar, and shaping a culture that can help us achieve great things for the club and our fans this season.”\nThe player registrations are subject to the completion of regulatory processes.\n--IANS\nbsk/",
