  "body_text": "Liverpool’s right-back conundrum might not be their most pressing concern – the midfield shenanigans sparked by Saudi Arabia’s double raid on the club in the last fortnight have seen to that – but it is still one that needs solving.\nAdmittedly, any club with a fit Trent Alexander-Arnold should not have too much to worry about in terms of who plays right-back. The 24-year-old, a club captain in waiting, is still one of the most talented players in world football so if Liverpool need him, he’s there.\nAdvertisement\nThe question is whether Alexander-Arnold’s game has evolved to the stage where he is now a better midfielder than full-back, and whether manager Jurgen Klopp should focus on getting the best out of him in that new role.\nGiven the uncertainty in midfield, with Jordan Henderson having left for Al Ettifaq and Fabinho looking certain to go to Al Ittihad, Alexander-Arnold might also be the safest option to start the coming season as the No 6, having played there for both Liverpool and England this summer.\nMoves are already afoot in the transfer market to fill these newly-created holes, with Southampton’s Romeo Lavia the primary target, but if Alexander-Arnold was to be used as a No 6 solution, even if only in the short term, where does that leave Liverpool at right-back?\nThe options are Joe Gomez – now their longest-serving first-team player in the wake of Henderson’s departure despite only turning 26 two months ago; he is entering his ninth season at Anfield – and Conor Bradley, one of the club’s most talented academy graduates. But are either of those players the real answer?\nIf Gomez can rediscover his form from 2019-20, it’s a no-brainer. He sat alongside Virgil van Dijk during that title-winning campaign and looked like he could be a part of the club’s back line for many years to come.\nWhen he extended his contract until 2027 last summer, Klopp said his “best years” were still ahead of him, yet that wasn’t backed up in his performances over the season that followed.\nGO DEEPER\nInside Henderson's Saudi deal: Gerrard's strategy, Klopp home truths, 'frightening' wages\nGomez started just nine games from the middle of January and only three in the season’s last 14 weeks – two of the three being the 5-2 home defeat to Real Madrid in the first leg of a Champions League last-16 tie and the 4-4 final-day draw away to already-relegated Southampton when Liverpool had nothing to play for.\nAdvertisement\nOf course, he wasn’t solely to blame for Liverpool conceding so many goals in those games. There were wider defensive issues that needed addressing. But he still has a point to prove after a dip in form.\nWith adequate support around him, and if used in the right system, Gomez has shown his worth in the past. He’s still only in his mid-twenties and is understood to be relishing the prospect of a new challenge in the coming season. He’s happy at Anfield and both fit and raring to go.\nRight now, if it’s not Alexander-Arnold at right-back on the opening game of the season away to Chelsea on August 13, it’s most likely to be Gomez.\nWith James Milner having left for Brighton & Hove Albion when his contract expired at the end of last season, the fresh-faced Bradley is the only alternative.\nStill only 20, the Northern Irishman may have been ruled out of the club’s ongoing two-game trip to Singapore with a minor injury, but he is gradually gaining the trust of Klopp and his coaches after a successful loan season where he started 43 league games in helping Bolton Wanderers reach the League One play-offs.\nAs The Athletic reported earlier this week, Bradley is set to sign a contract extension, which comes as a blow to several Premier League clubs who registered an interest in signing him on a permanent deal this summer.\nEager recruitment staff at clubs in the Championship have also been knocked back when lodging loan requests. The feedback they have received is he’s not available and that Bradley is most likely to be integrated into the first-team squad and used by Klopp when needed.\nThere is always a risk in throwing a youngster into a team that is undergoing a huge transformation, but there’s a growing sense at Liverpool that Bradley is ready for that step up. The player himself turned down the opportunity to move to the Championship for the second half of last season, instead favouring a full campaign at Bolton, where he was voted their supporters’ player of the year, players’ player of the year and young player of the year.\nThis pre-season at Liverpool, Bradley says, feels “different”.\n“I’m fighting for a spot now,” he adds, having started both friendlies so far against Karlsruhe and Greuther Furth in Germany.\nAdvertisement\nLearning the intricacies of the inverted role Alexander-Arnold played so well at the back end of last season is crucial.\nThe 3-box-3 formation that helped Liverpool end with a flourish has been tried in those two friendlies but with varying a degree of flexibility.\nTake, for example, the 4-4 draw with Greuther Furth on Monday. Bradley played the first half at right-back and when Liverpool had possession he moved into an inverted midfield role. Yet when Gomez came on for the second half, while he was also the right-back, he became one of three centre-backs when Liverpool had possession and the onus was for the left-back, Kostas Tsimikas, to take on the inverted role.\nIf Gomez isn’t used in the inverted role during the remaining pre-season matches, it’s likely Klopp will need to adjust the formation for him to start. That would mean either going with a flat back four, or Andrew Robertson at left-back, tucking inside when required.\nThe big question is whether experience is needed, especially at a tough starting venue such as Stamford Bridge.\nWith Liverpool’s midfield also in a state of flux, it’s worth noting that during the 10-game run at the back end of last season which began with that 2-2 comeback draw against Arsenal at Anfield, Henderson featured in every game and Milner, albeit as a bit-part player, played in the final nine.\nTheir experience was crucial but every team needs to evolve and find younger, fresher alternatives over time.\nLiverpool still have three more friendlies in which to experiment and, crucially, will have another two and a bit weeks after the trip to Chelsea to make further moves in the transfer window.\nIn the meantime, their right-back dilemma remains intriguing.\nKlopp will be sure he has enough to choose from but getting it right will be crucial as Liverpool look for some much-needed stability in the push to not only return to the Champions League but to mount another serious title challenge.\n(Top photos: Getty Images)",
