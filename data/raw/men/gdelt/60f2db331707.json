It’s so important to have a centre forward, no team ever wins anything without a good one.\nMore Trending\n‘Arsenal are suffering now and I think it’s a worry now until the end of the season.\n‘Look at the games, they’ve got to score goals and there’s no goals in them.\n‘It’s started to get tight there and Man City have got some nice fixtures there and it wouldn’t surprise me if Man City who are fifth at the moment catch Arsenal.’\nMORE: Chelsea loanee slated after ‘absolutely ludicrous’ error costs team win\nMORE: Gary Neville reveals mistake Arsenal made for Bruno Fernandes goal vs Man Utd\nMORE: Enzo Maresca reveals Cole Palmer had diarrhoea before Leicester disaster-class",
