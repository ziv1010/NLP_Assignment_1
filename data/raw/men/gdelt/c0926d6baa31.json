Overall, Town had had eight away draws in succession in both cup competitions, five in the Carling Cup.\nKeane said: “We’re just pleased we’ve got a home draw, we’re surprised we’re at home. I think we were in the last couple of teams that came out.\n“We’re glad for the home draw, glad for the supporters because it was eight in a row away. It’s nice, but that game will take care of itself. Our priority now is Tuesday and we’ll need to play better than we did at Scunthorpe.”\nKeane previously came up against the Cobblers in the same competition in 2008 when Sunderland boss, his side winning on penalties after a 2-2 draw.\nNorthampton manager Ian Sampson is looking forward to pitting his wits against Keane: \"Ipswich have got a manager who demands excellence, just like how he played.\n\"He called [the 2008 result] one of his worst times in football. Hopefully we can do that again to him. But they won't rest players - it's a big game.\"\nThe last meeting between Town and Northampton was in the 1987/88 season, also in the League Cup, on that occasion at the second round stage.\nThe Cobblers came away from the first leg at Portman Road with a 1-1 draw, Romeo Zondervan having scored for the Blues, but Town won at the County Ground, Mich D’Avray (2), Graham Harbey and David Lowe netting for John Duncan’s men in a game which went to extra time.\nIn the 1977/78 season the Blues won another second round tie, Trevor Whymark (2), Eric Gates, Paul Mariner and Clive Woods scoring the goals.\nOverall, the Blues have won 11 games between the teams (nine in the league), 10 (seven) have been draws with Northampton winning 10 (10).\nCarling Cup - Fourth Round\nNewcastle v Arsenal\nBirmingham City v Brentford\nWigan Athletic v Swansea City\nAston Villa v Burnley\nLeicester City v WBA\nManchester United v Wolverhampton Wanderers\nWest Ham v Stoke City\nIpswich v Northampton\nFourth round ties take place on either Tuesday 26th or Wednesday 27th October.\nPhoto: Action Images via Reuters\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\nNorthampton will have been hoping for a bigger team and the manager seemed genuinely gutted that he was only playing The Town - presumably realising that they won't be progressing much further in the cup as we'd be putting a strong team out (unlike Liverpool reserves!)\nWe haven't had a good cup run for a few years so lets enjoy it whilst it lasts, and with there being 3 all Premier League ties, who knows, we could be realistically be in with a shot of the semi's ?!!\nDoes anyone else share my optimism??\nNewcastle, Birmingham, Swansea, Villa, West Brom, Man Utd, Stoke, and of course, the Mighty Switch. Any of those would be pretty tough for us, but imagine if we beat Northampton and then got Newcastle at home (if they beat Arsenal) - I see a mighty revenge on the cards!!\nCOYB!\n... We can dream can't we???\nkeep it up roy and the boys.\nWill you have my babes?lol\nEverything you just said is exactly what i was thinking, i do think there are some fans who just want to pick holes in the players and manager we have at the minute just to try and get a bite out of someone and if the truth be told i think if Sir Bobby himself (God rest his soul) were in charge they would still moan.\nby all means have an opinion but being down right negative all the time is just stupid and shows that you know nothing about football or indeed our club.\nAnyway,\nI think we will win and on current form i don't really mind who we get at home...\nAnd yes i will be going and SUPPORTING the guy's\nCOYB\nCan we kill this myth off? That evening, Inter's starting eleven included eight of the eleven players who were their most regular starters in Serie A that season. They rested Vieri and Ronaldo was injured, iirc. It was a pretty strong side.\nAnyway, I like the League Cup simply because it makes for a much more interesting week when you've got a midweek game to look forward to. I think Keane has used the competition well to look at the younger players, many of whom have gone on to play in the league as a result. We should go for it and hopefully look forward to a big QF and/or SF.\nI do still agree with you, it was a strong team mate .. its just that all the talk at the time was that we got lucky because players were rested which seems to have taken the gloss off what an amazing victory it was!\nSecondly ... Zippy ... YOU REALLY MUST BE A DELIA LOVING PR*CK!!\nWith exception of Man U & Arsenal, I would also fancy us to gave any of the remaining PremierLeague teams a good game at PR. The players will really be up for big cup games and its an opportunity to get a glimpse of the potential this team has. Newcastle at PR would be my ideal draw in next round.\nI hope we get a full crowd for the game. Being from Ireland, I am not being able to get over to PR as much as I would like. I am jealous of all you people :(\nPlease give us a full crowd!\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
