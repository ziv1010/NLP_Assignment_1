He immediately vowed to get United back to the heights of world football.\nAfter an eighth-placed Premier League finish last term, that’s necessary.\nThe new regime is also losing two stars of old. Four-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid, Raphael Varane, is definitely leaving, and Casemiro – a five-time winner of the same competition – looks likely to be sold, with a move to Saudi Arabia a possible route.\nAnd with that much experience being taken away from Old Trafford, Ratcliffe will have a task on his hand to get some quality back in.\nBenfica pair Neves and Silva have been on United’s radar for some time, and they would no doubt add to the quality in the midfield and defence, respectively.\nIt has been suggested that Liverpool could look to barge in on any move for the former.\nBut United are now seemingly preparing a huge offer to get the ball rolling.\nDON’T MISS: Man Utd midfield targets: EVERY option linked for the summer 2024 transfer window\nUnited preparing £228m triple deal\nIndeed, reports suggest the Red Devils are considering submitting bids for Neves and Silva, along with their Benfica teammate Aursnes.\nThe latter has played the majority of his career in defensive-midfield, but last season was deployed at both right and left-back, as well as on the wing on occasion, so would be a useful player to have in a number of positions.\nThe bid from United could be a ludicrous one, as it’s suggested the combined deal for the trio would be worth £228million.\nThe enormous outlay would be a huge statement of intent from Ratcliffe at his new side, though there will surely need to be some sales before it’s possible for that fee to be paid.\nIf it is, though, Neves already looks a perfect Casemiro replacement, and Silva could easily carry the mantle left by Varane. Aursnes’ versatility would be ideal for a side whose defence was hindered massively by injuries last season.\nPSG could harm United deal\nThough part of the deal for the Benfica trio could be stopped by Paris Saint-Germain.\nIndeed, it’s said they now have concrete interest in signing £101million man Neves.\nIt’s likely they would not take issue with paying that release clause, particularly after getting Kylian Mbappe’s huge contract off the books.\nUnited will hope the French giants move onto one of the other midfield targets they are said to have, or their enormous deal could be put on ice.\nREAD MORE: Man Utd transfers: TEN top stars from Euro 2024 being hunted by Sir Jim Ratcliffe",
