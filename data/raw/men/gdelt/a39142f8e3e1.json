Sports.\nThe gravity of the injury was confirmed the following day by his club, Al Hilal in Saudi Arabia, and the Brazilian medical authorities.\nIt was established that Neymar had torn his left anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus, a condition necessitating surgical intervention.\n\"Medical examinations revealed that player Neymar Jr. suffered a torn cruciate ligament and cartilage. He will undergo surgery later, and a treatment program for the postoperative period will be determined,\" Al Hilal's statement read.\nThe club conveyed this announcement through social media, accompanied by a graphic image depicting Neymar in pain on the field.\nThe unfortunate incident occurred just before halftime of the match in Montevideo, Uruguay, when Uruguay's Nicolás de la Cruz brought Neymar down to the ground.\nNeymar's immediate response was to clutch his left leg and knee, displaying evident discomfort.\nHe remained on the field for an extended period before being carefully placed on a cart and taken away from the pitch.\nREAD NEXT : Why Is Neymar Facing a $3.3 Million Punishment?\nNeymar Injuries\nNeymar's illustrious career has been marred by a recurring pattern of injuries, starting with his tenure at Paris St Germain and extending to his international commitments, per The Guardian.\nDuring his time at PSG, Neymar endured multiple setbacks, notably suffering from extended periods on the sidelines due to right foot injuries. These injuries compelled him to undergo lengthy spells of rehabilitation.\nHis international career also faced significant challenges. In the 2014 World Cup, Neymar encountered a debilitating back injury during the quarter-final victory over Colombia.\nThis unfortunate incident ruled him out of the subsequent 7-1 semi-final defeat by Germany, which remains one of the most memorable moments in World Cup history.\nThe 2018 World Cup in Russia was another chapter marred by injuries. In the early months of that year, Neymar experienced a sprained right ankle, affecting the fifth metatarsal in his foot.\nThis ailment hampered his performance, particularly during his participation in the World Cup with the Brazilian national team.\nDespite his determination to persevere through the pain, Brazil was eventually eliminated by Belgium in the quarter-finals.\nThe following years witnessed a recurring pattern of injuries for the forward, with incidents in 2019, 2021, and even during the Qatar World Cup in the previous year.\nEarly in the current year, Neymar underwent right ankle surgery, requiring a five-month period of recovery. Following this, he made a move from Paris St Germain to Al-Hilal, signing a two-year contract.\nNeymar Career\nNeymar achieved a historic milestone last month when he broke Pele's record for the most goals scored for the Brazil national team, the Score noted.\nHe reached this landmark during a World Cup qualifying match against Bolivia, scoring his 78th and 79th international goals in a resounding 5-1 victory.\nThe significance of this achievement was not lost on Brazilian soccer, as Ednaldo Rodrigues, the president of the Brazilian Soccer Confederation, noted the importance of a healthy Neymar to both Brazilian and world soccer.\nHe highlighted the joy Neymar's presence on the field brings to the sport.\nNeymar's record-breaking feat was accomplished amid his journey with Saudi club Al Hilal, where he embarked on his tenure in August.\nHowever, his start with the club was marked by a slow beginning, primarily due to an injury that limited his participation to just three appearances in the domestic league and two in the Asian Champions League, where he managed to secure one goal.\nHis move to Saudi Arabia from Paris Saint-Germain was one of the notable transfers in the world of football, reportedly worth 90 million euros ($98 million).\nIn the wake of Cristiano Ronaldo's move to Al-Nassr in December, Neymar's transfer further underscored the oil-rich kingdom's efforts to establish itself as a significant force in international soccer.\nREAD MORE : Neymar Net Worth 2023\nThis article is owned by Latin Post.\nWritten by: Bert Hoover\nWATCH: Neymar Gets Serious Knee Injury vs Uruguay - Doctor Explains - From Brian Sutterer MD\nSubscribe to Latin Post!\nSign up for our free newsletter for the Latest coverage!\n© 2026 Latin Post.
