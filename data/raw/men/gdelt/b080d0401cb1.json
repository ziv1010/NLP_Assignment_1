  "body_text": "By Web Desk\nFebruary 25, 2024\nLiverpool have identified Ruben Amorim and Julian Nagelsmann as potential candidates to sign if they fail to bring Bayer Leverkusen’s current head coach Xabi Alonso to Anfield in the summer, reported The Telegraph on Sunday.\nJürgen Klopp joined the club in October 2015 and has been leading The Reds since then. Under his leadership, the club won its first Premier League in 30 years in 2020, UEFA Champions League and other titles.\nThe German will lead Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final against Chelsea on February 25 at Wembley Stadium and can secure a title in his final season before saying goodbye to the club.\nAlonso emerged as the leading contender, steering his Bayer Leverkusen squad to the top of the Bundesliga, securing another victory on Friday night and setting a new record in Germany with an unbeaten streak spanning 33 games.\nLiverpool face uncertainty in persuading Alonso, who possesses alternative options, including remaining at Leverkusen or potentially joining Bayern after Thomas Tuchel's departure in the summer.\nRuben Amorim is under contract for another two seasons at Sporting Lisbon beyond this summer, necessitating Liverpool to pay compensation. The 39-year-old has revitalised sporting's title aspirations this season, with the team challenging Benfica at the summit, having secured the title in 2021.\nRegarded as one of Europe's most promising young coaches, Amorim previously attracted attention from Premier League clubs, demonstrating significant managerial value through metrics evaluating a manager's impact on squad performance relative to expenditure.\nJulian Nagelsmann will become available after this summer's European Championships, with his contract with the German Football Association expiring.\nDespite his premature departure from Bayern last March, Nagelsmann remains highly regarded for his managerial prowess in optimising squad performance relative to financial investment.\nThis approach resonates with Liverpool's historical preference, reminiscent of when Klopp was identified as the ideal candidate, initially in 2012 and later in 2015 when he assumed the role.",
