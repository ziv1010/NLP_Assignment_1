  "body_text": "Four of England’s six Gunneresses did so three years ago, meaning whatever happens this weekend, they have already done so much to help women’s football grow in the UK.\nTo say our club have provided a backbone would be an understatement.\nFrom the English captain and striker to the super subs, the red half of North London has represented their country with pride in Switzerland.\nRemember, six Gunners between these two squads lifted the UEFA Women’s Champions League, so to add a Euros medal to the collection is a dream.\nHere is how the Gunneresses got England to Sunday’s Final…\nLeah Williamson\nShe became one of the leaders of the rise of women’s football in the UK by captaining her country to the Euros 2022 win three years ago.\nSandwiched between then and Sunday’s Final, the defender lifted the UEFA Women’s Champions League with Arsenal.\nSo even if the 28-year-old never won another medal, her legacy is secured.\nYou sense her qualities in Switzerland have been just as crucial off the pitch?\nWith Mary Earps retiring and Millie Bright needing a physical and mental rest, England lost serious experience.\nWith little time to prepare with a new defence, the Lionesses have started with three different centre-back partnerships so far at this tournament.\nUnderstandably then, there have been individual mistakes and errors leading to goals.\nWilliamson has had to highlight her leadership skills by finding the right balance in what she says.\nOn one hand, she has let the dressing room know how proud she is of their resilience but, like any great skipper, has warned her peers they do not need to be getting themselves in these awkward situations.\nYou sense our centre-back is aware that if they play on Sunday how they have in the knockout stages, it will not be enough?\nAlessia Russo\nThree years ago, Ellen White would tire out defences before substitute Russo got to pick up the scraps.\nNow the roles are reversed, with the 26-year-old now starting and running herself into the ground, setting up the platform for the subs to make an impact.\nOf course, any striker would want more than one goal, but her work rate is vital when you consider the late goals we have scored in the knockout stages.\nChloe Kelly\nAfter the Sweden tie I wrote 2025 has been like a movie for Kelly. Well, Italy was her sequel.\nGiven England’s penalty record so far at the Euros, she was the logical choice to step up on Tuesday night to take a spot kick with a couple of minutes left to play.\nEven when she failed, the 27-year-old still managed to succeed, smiling to the cameras and shrugging her shoulders like it was never in doubt and that was how she planned it in the first place.\nIt is worth remembering that at the start of the year the midfielder assumed she would not be on the plane to Switzerland and was in fact considering taking a break from the sport.\nWhile she has not gone into detail, she clearly disagreed with how she was treated at Man City and it impacted her mental health.\nA loan back to Arsenal saw her find her smile, but lifting the Champions League was supposed to be the fairytale ending.\nShe has been the super sub of the Euros so far, creating both goals in the quarter-finals and getting the semi-final winner.\nBeth Mead\nThe player of the tournament three years ago, no player scored or assisted more goals than Beth Mead at the Euros 2022.\nThat led to her winning numerous individual awards, including the BBC Women’s Footballer of the Year 2022.\nThe fact then that the 30-year-old has only started one game so far at this competition is a reflection on the depth of quality Sarina Wiegman has to choose from.\nYet in the last couple of weeks the Lionesses have been the perfect example of how crucial everyone in the squad is to a successful team.\nThe English subs have been just as vital as those who start.\nIn both of the knockout rounds, Mead used her experience to change her role and keep the ball alive to set up goals for Agyemang.\nWith a feeling that James might be tired, do not rule out Mead starting the Final.\nAgyemang\nOriginally seen as the wildcard in the England squad, it has already gone better than anyone could have expected for the 19-year-old.\nWhatever happens, you sense she could become a superstar in the WSL next season and it will be up to Arsenal to make sure the teenager has the correct network around her and does not get carried away with her new-found fame.\nThankfully, she has been humble in her interviews so far after twice keeping her country in the Euros by the skin of their teeth.\nTo have the mentality to come off the bench and keep her composure speaks volumes.\nThere is even a campaign for her to start on Sunday, but we have to remember her age.\nPlus, why try and fix something that is not broken?\nScore this weekend and she becomes famous.\nLotte Wubben-Moy\nThe only Gunneress yet to play a second at this Euros.\nWhich she knew was a possibility due to the level of competition.\nShe might feel disappointed though that with Sarina Wiegman choosing to change around her defence, it was not decided to take advantage of Wubben-Moy and Williamson playing together at times at club level.\nWill you be watching the final on Sunday?\nWhat’s your prediction for England v Spain? The two went head to head in the FIFA Women’s World Cup Final 2023, with the Lionesses falling 1-0 to La Roja at the final hurdle.\nCome on England!\nCOYG!\nDan Smith\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nADMIN COMMENT\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans.
