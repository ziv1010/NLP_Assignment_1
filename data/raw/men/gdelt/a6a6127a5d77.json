Messi has now finished among the top three a record 14 times in total, finishing runner-up on five occasions.\n\"I couldn’t imagine having the career that I’ve had. Everything that I’ve achieved. The fortune I’ve had playing for the best team in the world, the best team in history. It’s nice to win these individual trophies. To win the Copa America and then the World Cup, to get it done is amazing,\" Messi said.\n\"All of them (Ballon d'Or awards) are special for different reasons,\" he added.\n\"I'm happy to get that recognition that I'm getting thanks to what we have achieved with the national team,\" Messi told Reuters.\n\"This (World Cup) title we had been aiming for for so many years makes it even more special.\"\nAsked if he would carry on until the 2026 World Cup, Messi said: \"I don't think about it. I'll enjoy (my career) day by day. There will first be the Copa America in the United States (in 2024). (The World Cup), I don't think about it.\"\nEarlier, Messi's World Cup-winning team mate Emiliano Martinez won the Lev Yashin award for the world's best goalkeeper.\nSpain's Women's World Cup winner and Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmati won the women's Ballon d'Or.\n\"It's an individual trophy but it can't exist without a team,\" she told reporters.\nMessi, who won his first Ballon d'Or in 2009 and claimed four in a row until 2012, finished second to Haaland at the UEFA awards in August.\nHaaland, 23, was one of the firm favourites for his first Ballon d'Or after scoring 52 goals in 53 matches in all competitions last season as City won the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup.\nBut Argentina's magical run at the World Cup in Qatar, where Messi earned the Golden Ball for best overall player and Silver Boot (seven goals and three assists), helped him pip the Norwegian striker to the award.\nThe World Cup was the only major trophy missing from Messi's resume as Argentina made amends for losing the 2014 final to Germany while in March he became only the third player in history to score 100 international goals.\nMessi also won the Ligue 1 title with Paris St Germain before moving to Inter Miami, where he helped the Major League Soccer side win the Leagues Cup — their first major trophy.\nReal Madrid and England midfielder Jude Bellingham won the Kopa Trophy for the best Under-21 player, while club team mate Vinicius Jr. was awarded the Socrates Award for his humanitarian work off the pitch.",
