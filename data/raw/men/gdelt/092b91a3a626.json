It is clear he will play a big part in Los Blancos' future, but not in which role.\nAs well as Tchouameni and Valverde, Madrid have also been linked with a big summer move for another midfielder in Borussia Dortmund's Jude Bellingham.\n\"I'm surprised how quickly he's adapted to Madrid because it's a very big club and it's not easy,\" said former Madrid midfielder Claude Makelele earlier in May.\n\"I see him as a footballer with a great future.\"\nMan City may view Camavinga as Madrid's weak link after his first-leg mistake, but he also emerged with the most tackles made and duels won, keeping Bernardo Silva quiet.\nIf Pep Guardiola's side target him, Camavinga has shown he can rise to the challenge.\n© 2023 AFP",
