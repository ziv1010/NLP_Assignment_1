  "body_text": "Carlo Ancelotti and Real Madrid. It just works.\nBoth share unmatched European pedigree, trophy-laden histories, and command a certain respect when it comes to keeping talent-stacked squads in check.\nBut there is something more understated that sets both manager and club apart: an ability to constantly evolve.\nAdvertisement\nReal Madrid have gone 238 games — coming up to six years — without naming an unchanged starting XI in La Liga, a remarkable run kept up by Ancelotti’s tactical tinkering in his fifth and potentially final season at the club.\nWhile the departure of club legend Karim Benzema to Saudi Arabian side Al Ittihad might have forced the Italian’s hand, his shuffling of six superstar options through four midfield spots has been as considered as ever, reminiscent of when Clarence Seedorf, Andrea Pirlo, Gennaro Gattuso, Kaka and others would float in and out of his iconic AC Milan team.\nThis season, from Eduardo Camavinga playing as a marauding left-back to Jude Bellingham being pushed up front, flexibility has been key to exploiting the myriad skill sets across the group and allowing the side’s big names to coexist.\nAnywhere between two to four changes has been standard, while no player has started every game this campaign.\nAt the centre of most of that tweaking has been the midfield diamond that Ancelotti introduced this season, of which we have already seen eight unique variations in just 13 competitive games.\nGO DEEPER\nPivotal Bellingham and a new role for Vinicius Jr - analysing Real Madrid's new setup\nThe latest was trialled away at Braga in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday night, with Luka Modric joining Camavinga in patrolling from deep, while Federico Valverde shuttled up and down the right, allowing Bellingham to push on and link up with Vinicius Junior.\nBut it was also only the third time that Aurelien Tchouameni did not start at the base of midfield this season. For all the swirling flexibility of his side, Ancelotti has his favourites.\nThe most common variation, deployed in five separate games, has featured Toni Kroos dictating the tempo on the left, joining the anchor Tchouameni, the freight train Valverde on the right and the box-crashing Bellingham at the tip of the diamond.\nAdvertisement\nCamavinga has flitted between the left side of midfield and full-back, while Modric has only started four times — on the right, the left and down the middle. Now 38 years old — the third-oldest outfield player in La Liga — the Croatian’s seven passes leading to shots against Braga served as a reminder of his supreme quality, even as he adapts to a reduced role in the side.\nGO DEEPER\nKroos and Modric: New roles have left Madrid legends at crossroads\nAside from the seemingly boundless energy that all six players seem to possess, looking to the data provides an insight into just what makes Madrid’s midfield options so flexible.\nOf players to have completed at least 50 tackles since the start of last season, three of Ancelotti’s midfielders are among the best 10 midfielders for turnover rate, a metric that divides a player’s total open-play touches by the number of times they are dispossessed. The lower the percentage, the better a player is at retaining the ball relative to the number of touches they have.\nComposure and two-footed technical ability, alongside defensive bite, allow each player to operate comfortably across the pitch.\nTchouameni’s league-leading figures underline his credentials for the deep-lying role. The Frenchman is a midfielder with an immaculate passing range who can emerge from most high-pressure situations unscathed.\nWith a passing accuracy of 93.4 per cent — the second-highest in the division since the start of last season — he also boasts a higher take-on success rate than his team-mates in midfield, reserving that imperious ability to stride away from danger with the ball at his feet for when it is needed most.\nAs his pass sonar below demonstrates, Tchouameni is at his best when dictating play from deep, able to sweep the ball from side to side over long distances with high accuracy.\nAn aerial-duel win rate of 69.1 per cent also makes him a capable defensive screen, while no midfielder with more than 50 tackles can better his true-tackle win rate in La Liga since 2022-23.\nEven at 23 years old, few can argue with his rightful place at the base of the diamond.\nAdvertisement\nKroos has long been able to do much of the same, but Tchouameni’s emergence has allowed the legendary midfielder to focus on doing what he does best: progressing the ball.\nThe German’s passing figures continue to dazzle in his 10th season at the club, having completed more passes, taken more touches and completed more carries per game than any other La Liga player since the start of last season, all while maintaining the highest passing accuracy.\nKroos also leads the way for passes into the final third, with a supreme ability to break down stubborn midfield lines from deep. With Tchouameni covering, he has been allowed to drift into his favourite areas in the left half-space, where he is so clinical when given space to thread passes into opposition territory.\nHaving been rested alongside Tchouameni on Tuesday, he is sure to start the Clasico this weekend.\nOn the opposite side of the diamond, Valverde has been one of the other mainstays of Ancelotti’s system, starting 10 of Madrid’s 13 games this campaign.\nFew players in world football possess the drive of the 25-year-old. He is an incredible athlete who also possesses a ferocious long-range strike, as seen against Napoli in the Champions League this month.\nInsane shot 🤯#UCL pic.twitter.com/1DrOh2XRA2\n— UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) October 5, 2023\nWith most of the action sucked over to Real’s left flank — where Vinicius Jr regularly draws the attention of multiple defenders and Fran Garcia, Camavinga and Bellingham all swarm around to bring him into play — Valverde often finds himself with the freedom of the right half-space.\nThat is where his famous running power comes into its own. He is able to thunder up and down the pitch to arrive at the back post for crosses or tear through lopsided opposition structures with the ball at his feet.\nValverde is also a terrific ball-winner, with a high true-tackle win rate of 63.9 per cent.\nAt times, he can run the right side all by himself.\nAdvertisement\nLast but not least, there is Bellingham.\nWhile nominally starting as the most advanced midfielder of the four, the Englishman’s endless energy means he pops up all over the pitch. La Liga’s top scorer with eight goals, he has also drawn the most fouls of any player in the division.\nMore than ever, though, Bellingham has been gravitating into dangerous areas, seeing his touches in the attacking third increase by almost 25 per cent, and his penalty-area touches jump from 3.5 to 5.3 per game.\nGO DEEPER\n'Birmingham to the Bernabeu isn't natural': Playing with (and against) Jude Bellingham\nHe has not been shooting much more often than in previous seasons, but his more advanced position has led to his shot distance plummeting, while the average quality of his shot, at 0.18 xG, is among the best in La Liga.\nThe goals have followed and do not look like stopping any time soon.\nBellingham could hardly have wished for a better start to life in Spain, and Ancelotti must take credit for this once again.\nThirteen games, 11 wins, and eight different engine rooms — Real Madrid’s super-strength continues to be a midfield quartet that can adapt in an instant.\nCamavinga can come in for Kroos to shore up the left side of midfield, Modric can replace Valverde if more creativity between the lines is required, Tchouameni can bomb forward and Bellingham can track back. The six of them can do most things better than anyone else.\nA colossal midfield battle with Barcelona awaits this weekend.\nGO DEEPER\nEl Clasico: Real Madrid and Barcelona's week of tension won't change their alliance\n(Top photo: Diego Souto/Quality Sport Images/Getty Images)",
