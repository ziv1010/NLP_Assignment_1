And it was an outburst that was lapped up by the 50,000 strong crowd inside the stadium.\nHaving sold out St James' Park two nights in a row back in June 2023, Sam is back at the ground this week for three packed out gigs, as an estimated 150,000 fans are set to flock to see him over the course of the next few days. And just like two years ago, the atmosphere inside SJP for night one was akin to a United home match, with flags held aloft in the air to greet Sam and his band, as they arrived on stage to not only the strains of famous NUFC anthem Local Hero, but also the added bonus of the Champions League theme.\nThe 1-0 defeat to Everton on the final day of the season meant that Eddie Howe's men had to do it the hard way but, after Man United did them a favour, they WILL indeed be in the pot for Europe's biggest competition next season and, with much loved defender Dan Burn in the crowd to see Sam dedicate Pretty Green Eyes to him, there was more talk of football as Sam mentioned the fact he'd spotted a banner held up by a Sunderland fan of him 'with a severed head' on as the Black Cats triumphed at Wembley in the play-off final last month, sealing their return to the Premiership and the long awaited return of the Tyne-Wear derby.\nSeeing the funny side, Sam told his captive St James' audience: 'That's f**king magic that like. That's the best day ever.\" He then cheekily added: \"We live rent free.\"\nNight one of three at SJP proved to be quite a night as, as well as all the bangers from the Fender back catalogue and plenty of fireworks, there was a moment to remember for Newcastle busker Joe Bartley, as Sam invited him on stage to duet on The Borders, before he was joined by his former music teacher for a cracking rendition of Boys are Back in Town.\nWe have a dedicated newsletter for What’s On news and reviews.
