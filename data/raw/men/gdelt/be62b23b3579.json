A leaked email suggested the broadcaster was drawing up a statement announcing his departure, amid claims the new head of Sport was backing moves to shake up the presenter line-up.\nBut Lineker, whose £1.35m BBC contract ends in summer 2025, later said discussions had begun over extending his 25-year tenure fronting the flagship football show.\nIf fans sensed an air of nothing-to-see-here, and that perhaps more was going on behind the scenes, they might be right.\nAsked by i to respond to suggestions the BBC might be preparing to bring his reign to an end, representatives for Lineker replied with the words “Operation Shrimp”, accompanied by a flag of the Republic of Benin in West Africa.\nOperation Shrimp was a failed 1977 coup attempt in Benin, when French mercenaries tried to remove Mathieu Kérékou, the African nation’s revolutionary communist party leader.\nKérékou gained advance knowledge of the assailants’ intentions and fought off the attack, with North Korean support. He remained president for a further 14 years and returned for another 10-year term in 1996.\nLineker’s comparison may be dramatic but it outlines his desire to extend his tenure on MoTD. Even with extensive outside business interests – his Goalhanger podcast company is worth an estimated £30m – Lineker has no intention of being pushed out of his day job.\nThe 63-year-old has already survived the most serious threat to his job, after the BBC briefly suspended him for criticising the Conservative government’s immigration policy on social media last year.\nWhen fellow pundits, including Alan Shearer, refused to appear on MoTD in solidarity with Lineker, causing one edition to be dropped, BBC bosses swiftly reinstated him.\nLineker has indicated his willingness to take a £350,000 pay-cut in order to smooth a new deal, but some in the BBC believe cutting ties with the star would help demonstrate to the Labour government that it is serious about making savings ahead of discussions over the future of the licence fee.\n“The change of Government makes it easier for the BBC to move on from Gary,” a former senior executive said. “Previously, it would have been seen as a move caving in to Conservative pressure over his social media tweets but that won’t be the case under Labour.”\nOther figures within the corporation suggested Lineker could still have a prominent role to play in a “refreshed” MoTD, albeit for a significantly lower salary and with a reduced-length contract.\nSpeculation over Lineker’s immediate future was fuelled by the leak of an email, purported to have originated from Alex Kay-Jelski, the BBC’s head of Sport since June, which contained a draft press release announcing the presenter’s departure.\nThe BBC did not confirm or deny the authenticity of the email, published by the Daily Mail, which included a quote paying tribute to Lineker from Tim Davie, the BBC director-general.\nMr Kay-Jelski wants to “refresh” MoTD, with younger presenters helping to future-proof the Saturday night fixture, broadcasting sources say.\nBut ratings remain strong for the show under Lineker, despite Premiership goals now being available on YouTube within minutes of the final whistle.\nThe presenter has reportedly offered take a £350,000 a-year pay cut to stay on MoTD for a further two or three years.\n“The BBC is talking to a range of figures about contracts and as always there’s a bit of a dance going on,” one BBC figure said.\nLineker, whose pay peaked at £1.75m, agreed a five-year deal to lead the BBC’s football coverage in 2020. But the corporation, which is axeing 500 jobs in a bid to save £200m, is now looking to offer two or three-year contracts to top talent, at lower pay levels.\nAllies of Mr Kay-Jelski say MoTD needs to “evolve” now that Premiership goals are freely available on YouTube.\nThe BBC wants to make MoTD more of a prominent “brand” across weekends, rather than just an appointment-to-view on Saturday nights, i understands.\nAnother insider said: “Politically, it would be easier to lose Lineker now under Labour. But it’s really about whether the BBC wants to make a grand gesture by saying the days of massively inflated salaries for talent are over.\n“There are many who want to keep Gary, and he’s shown he’s wants to stay by floating the pay cut. But it could be in the wider corporate interest is that it’s better to let him go.”\nWhile the debate over his future swirls, Goalhanger has become the UK’s largest independent podcast producer. It is now expanding into live events, with a stage presentation of The Rest Is Politics hit show, presented by Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart, last week playing to a sell-out crowd of 13,000 fans at the O2 Arena.\nLineker and his Goalhanger co-founders, former BBC executive Jack Davenport and ex-ITV Sport controller Tony Pastor, could be in line for a multi-million pound payout if they agreed to sell the firm to a US podcast giant.\nThere is frustration among BBC bosses that Lineker and his fellow MoTD pundits Shearer and Micah Richards vent their often trenchant opinions on the Goalhanger-produced podcast, The Rest Is Football.\nThe programme records around eight million listens per month on YouTube alone.\nDuring last summer’s European Championships, Lineker called England’s 1-1 draw against Denmark “shit”, a remark which annoyed captain Harry Kane and threatened the BBC’s relationship with the England team.\nThose comments helped The Rest Is Football generate £125,000 during the Euro’s opening weeks.\n“It’s odd that the BBC is paying Lineker to be the face of football but he’s giving his most controversial opinions elsewhere,” said the former BBC executive.\nA former Sports Editor at the Daily Mail, Kay-Jelski has been tasked with representing the BBC in discussions with rights holders, including the Premier League, as well as driving sports viewing across the BBC’s digital services.\nThe “double act” of Lineker and Shearer is valued within the BBC Sports department, too. Reports suggest that the BBC has also opened negotiations for a new MoTD contract with Shearer, who earned £380,000 in 2023.\nWith a contract renewal yet to be confirmed, Lineker’s representatives are understood to have alerted ITV and streaming platforms which now show Premiership and Champions League games, to his potential availability. His current BBC contract is not exclusive, allowing Lineker to front an ITV game show, Sitting On A Fortune.\nNo rival broadcaster can offer the same platform and exposure as MoTD though, with the BBC’s current contract also calling on Lineker to guide the nation through summer international football tournaments as well as fronting its Sports Personality of the Year awards.\nLineker, whose reluctance to tame his social media use has made life difficult for BBC bosses, has said he wants to continue at the corporation for as long as they want him.\nIf Lineker was to land a new deal, signing off with his congratulations to Thomas Tuchel for guiding England to glory at the 2026 World Cup Final could be the ideal way to leave.\nThe BBC declined to comment.\nA BBC source said of Lineker’s situation: “We have nothing to announce and we have not agreed next steps with regard to his contract. He is under contract until the end of the season.”\nSources dismissed any suggestion that the change of government would have any influence over Lineker’s future.",
