Without a commercial partner in place, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has been unable to announce start of the top-tier Indian Super League (ISL).Siverio trained with Goa at the Athletic Stadium in Bambolim on Friday but will not be part of the squad for the concluding AFC Champions League Two group-stage clash against FC Istiklol on Dec 24.“I am not surprised with Siverio’s decision,” Manolo told TOI at the end of the training session on Friday. “Everyone is a professional footballer and need to continue playing. It’s true that it will be difficult for Indian players to go abroad, but I think a lot more foreigners will leave India in the next few days.”Most players have played just three competitive games this season in the Super Cup, while Goa have been active in continental competition.\nGet an chance to win ₹5000 Amazon Voucher by taking part in India's Biggest Habit Index!
