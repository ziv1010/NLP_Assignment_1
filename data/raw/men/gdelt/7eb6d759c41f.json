It was a great night, the team were tired, 4-2 with one more player, we think it’s over, but here it’s never over.\n‘Here everything is possible, you feel the environment. At 4-3, after the Bruno Fernandes penalty, we felt we could change the game.”\n‘We tried to put Harry Maguire up front because he is the only one who can score a goal with a header. Kobbie Mainoo has a lack of pace in this moment because of injury, but he’s really good in short spaces.’\nHarry Maguire speaking to TNT Sports\n‘Obviously it’s an incredible game, we made really hard work of it. We had full control in the second half, had chances to score a third, then they scored out of nowhere. It put us on the back foot.\n‘To go down 4-2 in extra-time to 10 men is not good enough, we opened ourselves too much. But we dug in and showed great spirit, that’s what this stadium does.’\nOn his goal: ‘I felt like the fourth goal for them was a sucker punch but that we’d get chances to get back into it. It fell to myself and thankfully I scored, it was an amazing feeling.’\nCelebrations at full-time\nFULL-TIME: Man Utd 5-4 Lyon (7-6 agg.)\nUNITED ARE THROUGH TO THE SEMI-FINALS!\nAmorim’s side looked dead and buried in injury time but late goals from Mainoo and Maguire secure a scarcely believable 7-6 aggregate win for the hosts who progress to the semi-finals to keep their season alive.\nAnd breathe…\nMan Utd 5-4 Lyon (7-6 agg.)\n120+7 mins: Into the eighth minute we go and we’re still playing.

Maguire rises highest to head home Casemiro’s cross and it’s bedlam in the Old Trafford stands.\nWhat a remarkable turnaround.\nGOAL!

From bad to worse for United as Shaw brings down Fofana inside the area.\nLyon with a chance to surely put this game to bed.\nMan Utd 2-3 Lyon (4-5 agg.)\n107 mins: A change for the visitors as Abner comes on for Cherki. A defensive switch from the visitors.\nUnited, meanwhile, have thrown Maguire forward as a makeshift striker as they go in search of an equaliser to send us to penalties.\nMan Utd 2-3 Lyon (4-5 agg.)\n106 mins: And we’re back underway. 15 minutes for United to save their season.\nHALF-TIME: Man Utd 2-3 Lyon (4-5 agg.)\nAdded time in extra-time flies by and United are suddenly staring an exit square in the face.\nA smattering of boos ring out from the Old Trafford crowd – they must be stunned by what they have witnessed after that superb first-half display.\nGOAL!
