I think we were the better team in the first half.\n“A couple of home games in a row that we should go in with a lead on the balance of play and on the chances, and we go in with a deficit. So we’re frustrated by that.\n“There’s no doubt that their execution whenever they got their big moments around our penalty box was better than our execution whenever we got our big moments around their penalty box. That was the difference between the two teams.\n“I think there were so many good things about the performance, there’s so much growth on the pitch, there’s a lot of growth still to come, but it’s a stage of the season where we’d like to have points on the board and it’s a game where we certainly could have had some and it could have been different, but it’s gone against us and we don’t get anything for that.”\nHe added: “Of course, it’s frustrating, it’s a frustrating game, but it is what it is. We can’t feel sorry for ourselves, we have to work to improve. I think we have improved in many aspects, I know we’ve had a difficult loss, so it doesn’t feel like that, but I know that we have. I believe very, very strongly in how we are working day-to-day. But it’s also it’s clear that margins have gone against us too often.\n“Certainly I don’t think we’ve had anything resembling luck in many different aspects this year, but also our execution compared to the opposition execution hasn’t been at the level quite often and small margins have gone against us in games and in moments in games that have taken matches away from us.\n“It’s frustrating. It’s not a stage of the season where we want to talk about growth or performances or pride in the performance because we want the points on the board. But at the same time we can’t lose patience with the good things that are going on.\n“I know that they are there and there’s evidence of it on the pitch and I see evidence of it day-to-day. So we’ve got to keep working to improve and see where it takes us.”\nThe first two Tottenham goals came from skipper Son Heung-min breaking into the left of the area. Did McKenna feel that his side might have opted to foul the South Korean before he crossed the 18-yard line?\n“No, they weren’t situations for me where there should be fouls,” he said. “They were two situations that we should do better in, no doubt about that, both in defending the individual actions and then the covering of those actions.\n“Again, you talk about margins going our way, our right-back [Axel Tuanzebe] was missing today for two yellows for committing one foul in the first half of a game [at Aston Villa] that meant we played 50 plus extra-time last week with 10 men and then we have to make another change to our backline today, which in our position, of course, makes it more difficult.\n“That was a challenge coming into the game and we didn’t defend those situations well enough in the first half.”\nDespite the result, McKenna and his team were given a warm reception by their fans at the whistle and the Blues boss was asked how he is taking the situation with Town having won only once at home this season.\n“I’m fine, the support is really appreciated,” he continued. “We don’t take it for granted, not every club gets it, but I also know that the club knows and the support knows the journey that the team’s been on. Can get bored of saying it, but that’s the reality.\n“We know playing Tottenham at home is a big step. Five years ago, we were in the middle of League One and they were in the Champions League final. It’s been a really quick rise to this point, which makes it a challenge.\n“But I also think the supporters are clever enough here and honest enough and balanced enough to see a lot of good things on the pitch today. There’s a lot of things to take pride in in terms of how we’re going about it, in terms of many of the performances at individual level, some of the young players on the pitch, the growth that we’re seeing and as a team that we’re doing so many good things.\n“There are a lot of different ways that we can lose to Tottenham Hotspur as Ipswich, a lot of different systems, styles of play, everything that would still have the same outcome, but I think the supporters are taking pride in some of the things they’re seeing. Of course, they’re frustrated, like we’re frustrated.\n“We can’t work any harder, so we’ve just got to keep working as hard as we can and work as smart as we can to get better, and the support that we have behind us is fantastic and it’s always appreciated and we’ve got to keep earning that support as well.”\nIn the build-up to Tottenham’s fourth goal Jacob Greaves clashed heads with former Blues loanee Dane Scarlett on halfway and was on the ground as the visitors broke forward. McKenna was asked whether he felt the game ought to have been stopped by referee Tim Robinson.\n“I think it’s usually stopped for a head injury,” he reflected. “I think when a player gets a whack on the head right in front of the fourth official, it’s usually stopped. But it’s not on the list of my biggest concerns today, to be honest.”\nTown’s defeat was compounded by Wolves, the team directly above them in 17th winning 1-0 away against a Cherries team, which was reduced to 10 men in the 31st minute when centre-half Illya Zabarnyi was red-carded.\nThat leaves the 18th-placed Blues five points behind the Molineux club but effectively six due to goal difference with 12 matches remaining.\nMcKenna was asked whether he still believed his team can dig themselves out of the relegation zone.\n“No doubt and we will while it’s possible,” he said. “It is what it is. They’ve picked up a good result today against 10 men with an early red card with a VAR. These are really, really small margins in football and they haven’t gone our way this year.\n“Of course, everyone probably thinks that but I don’t think anyone could say that we’ve had any sort of fortune or margins go our way too often.\n“It is what it is, we know we’ve got a big challenge to stay in the division. We know we’re going to have to pick up points at a greater rate in our last 12 games. I believe that we can pick our points up at a greater rate, for sure.\n“I feel that there’s improvement in the team, we’re still in a period, and I know it’s frustrating to say it again, but it’s just the reality of the situation and how it’s been, that we’ve still got a couple of players making home debuts today [keeper Alex Palmer and Jaden Philogene, who was making his first home start], and that’s been almost the case right through the season. We’ve not been able to settle on relationships and partnerships on the pitch too often.\n“But we’ve got to hope for better margins and luck on some of those things in the run-in and keep doing the good work and push for improvement and turning margins our way.\n“I believe that we can pick up a good amount of points in the last 12 games. Of course, when you’re in this position now, it’s not in our hands, so if other teams win all their games, we can’t control that.\n“We can only do what we do and that starts with Wednesday night [at another of his old clubs Manchester United]. A big challenge, we’ve got to pick ourselves up after today, go there and that’s a game to really try and take on.”\nTWTD\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\nITFC will go on whatever ,and most will still love the Club and all it stands for !\nHope springs eternal ,but we shall follow to the end !\nCOYB\nfor 1 the players ain't up to this level which is shame worked so hard getting to the premier league to buy players at championship level and expect to stay up when the likes of wolves Everton ect are buying players from overseas who are way better than what we have and for less money\npoint 2 a settled team would help why do he have to make so many changes every game no other team make that many players he talks about making partnership but how when he keep changing the team\nwe just have to look at it we ain't good enough at this level and buying players who haven't improved the squad is just a waste of money but hey ho least we have a better team for the championship to beat norwich\nWhatever happens between now and the end of the season it’s been a hell of a ride since he became manager. I’ll still be in my season ticket seat next season will you?\nWe will be back within 2 seasons.\nHe deservedly y earned well respected praises not just from ITFC fans but throughout the land for the last two seasons successes. ,,who would have wanted him to leave last Summer..barely anyone .\nBut this season has been awkward at least. He is experienced enough to know that the Premier League is a monstrous big fish.\nWe the supporters know it . He knows it.\nWe all so wanted this to be something of a replica to the big time as it was in 2000, but football has changed so so much in that time.\nSpurs were there to be taken said many, but today not because they were truly 4-1 better then us but because they are experienced and have physicality , speed on the break and a truly super player in Son.\nHe after 15 minutes realising that our excellent start might create extra pressure on his team demonstrated his talent against our nervous bemused right back. …sympathy for him in a way. He was spared further torture by his yellow card and McKennas sensible substitution.\nWe had no one who created such danger as did Son in those minutes setting were up goals one and two.\nWe came way from the ground disappointed , in a way downhearted but I saw very little lack of effort ,there was plenty of that but our penetration our defence splitting passes were absent from our approach play.\nHave we come here too soon ?\nThere is so much money in the bank for McKennas past efforts.\nIf he went what then ?\nThe relegation word is almost likely to signal a race for Liam Delaps signature.He has had a wonderful introduction to Premier League Football and suggested in the first 15 minutes today of more success. Sadly that didn’t happen and after the break , when it looked like we may have a chance thanks to Omaris strike, he almost disappeared from view.\nHe is still learning , he needs to be coaxed not to run out of steam and enthusiasm.\nWe all have our views on the newcomers to the squad from last summer and this January as I am sure does Kieran , Mark Ashton and the ownership.Lessons learned this season? .\nIf we go down this squad may prove so much better than Luton of last year but it is unlikely to be a squad able to do better if promoted again without an injection of more accomplished seasoned newcomers.\nWe may not love the Premier League as we did the Championship , we may not love VAR , we certainly don’t love the better more professional referees but truth is we would really love to be as good in the Premier League as Brighton and Bournemouth and Fulham …teams who historically would have loved to be an Ipswich Town.\nWill Kieran and Liam be here for those moments ahead ?\n@dirtywhatever\nI saw you waffle comments and the phucking size of em i didnt even attempt to read them!\nCould you have another go and tell us all in maybe 3 sentences such as!\nWe are down it has been good and bad and we know how brutal the premiership is!!\nCOYB we will come back up next season!! Come on lads\nPs. Let’s win the fa cup and do a Wigan haha\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
