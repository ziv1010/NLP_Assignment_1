This was not just a vindication of their smash-and-grab approach to this final, with Stina Blackstenius’ winner bringing the seemingly insuperable Barcelona to heel, but of their resolute philosophy that the women’s game should be nurtured rather than neglected. For proof, you needed only to look at the VIP party who assembled on the Lisbon pitch just before the golden tickertape rained down.\nHere, helping to present Renee Slegers’ players with their medals, was Josh Kroenke, the club’s co-chair and son of owner Stan, who had flown 5,000 miles from Colorado for the occasion. Contrast this with Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s disdain towards the Manchester United women’s team: they played an FA Cup final just a week ago at Wembley, a short chauffeured drive from his Knightsbridge offices, and still he could not be bothered to turn up.\nArsenal have shown what can be accomplished if those in charge are emotionally attached to the project. Kroenke Jnr, the slick corporate face of his family’s empire, has seldom dialled down his ambition for the women’s side. On his watch, they have been propelled from relative obscurity at Meadow Park to sell-outs at the Emirates Stadium to a Champions League triumph over all-conquering Barcelona, who had been chasing a second successive quadruple. Ian Wright, screaming like a banshee in the stands, tried to convey the significance of the moment. “The ladies,” he declared, “have saved the club.”\nYou could understand what he meant. In the days leading up to this final, Arsenal as an institution had been derided as specialists in failure, with fans suffering through the spectacle of Tottenham trooping down the Seven Sisters Road on an open-top bus, clutching a trophy despite lying 15 places below them in the Premier League. “It’s the embarrassment of getting nothing this season, when we’ve played so well this season with the men,” Wright said. “But now we’ve got something to celebrate.”\nAs a template for winning a final where almost nobody gave them a prayer, this was almost flawless, as Leah Williamson, anchoring the back four, soaked up wave after wave of Barcelona bombardment, only for Blackstenius to deliver the sucker punch. The Spanish champions had filleted treble-winners Chelsea in the semi-final with such brutality that the dominant debate around this match was not whether they would beat Arsenal, but by how many. Instead Slegers instilled a ferocious defiance, inspiring her players to believe that they would end the evening not as bridesmaids but as the first English winners of this competition for 18 years.\nThe champions on that day were Arsenal, too, but the scale of the prize has since changed beyond recognition. In 2007, this was still the Uefa Women’s Cup, not the Women’s Champions League. The final was still a two-legged affair, with the second leg taking place in front of just 3,500 at Meadow Park. Fast-forward to 2025 and more than that number of Arsenal fans had schlepped to Lisbon, grabbing whatever last-minute flights they could in the faint hope of glory. It was a journey worth the effort, with the sheer euphoria generated by these scenes promising to leave an indelible impact. There were 5,000 inside the Emirates merely for the watch party.\nThe spirit that Arsenal showed when they needed it most was extraordinary. It was a final flourish befitting European champions, in keeping with their earlier improbable comebacks against Lyon and Real Madrid. It also came against a backdrop of dramatic upheaval, with Slegers taking the reins only after predecessor Jonas Eidevall resigned during the campaign, leaving Kroenke to make a quick decision. He trusted that she could galvanise a team who had begun to doubt themselves. And now this young Dutch coach, just 36 and an Arsenal academy player when the club last savoured such a transformative achievement, has become a European champion herself.\nThe roots of Arsenal’s feat run deeper, though. Even before the Kroenkes’ arrival at the club in 2007, David Dein had recognised the potential of a thriving women’s team. As Clare Wheatley, the club’s director of women’s football, has put it: “David listened and he was forward-thinking. He always had a rationale as to why the women’s club should exist. It wasn’t about money, because, financially, there was nothing in return. It was about giving opportunities to female players of a certain level to be able to live their dreams.”\nThanks to a wonderfully unlikely outcome in Lisbon, this can be counted as a quest fulfilled. Williamson was the mascot in 2007, dutifully performing her part with her Under-10 team-mates in her kit, clutching a mini-football. This time she was the linchpin of Arsenal’s resistance, repeatedly thwarting players of the quality of Aitana Bonmati and Caroline Graham Hansen, who threw up their hands in despair at how often they were denied.\nWilliamson’s personal story offered the perfect encapsulation of Dein’s original vision. Arsenal, quite simply, have done this the right way, not by forcing a team to run before they could walk but by building crowds and profile step by step, piece by piece. Their approach has yielded the greatest reward. For Ratcliffe and his aloof ilk, it should serve as a salutary lesson.",
