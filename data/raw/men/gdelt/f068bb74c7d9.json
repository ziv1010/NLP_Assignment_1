Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘With the ball they are a team very close to the top European level and without the ball they are also very good.\n‘I would even say that they are one of the best teams in the world without the ball.\n‘They are a team with a real identity. We are similar but also have different styles of play.’\nEnrique and Arteta were team-mates for a short period at Barcelona and the PSG boss is looking forward to catching up his fellow countryman in north London.\n‘We were team-mates for a season at Barcelona even though he was young at the time. I have good memories of him as a team-mate,’ Enrique added.\n‘He had a great career as a player, he had a very successful end to his career.\n‘We haven’t faced off against each other since we’ve both been coaching.\n‘Even if it’s only five minutes before the game, I’d like to talk to him and it will be a pleasure to be able to greet him on Tuesday.\n‘He’s one of the best coaches on the market right now and he’s helped Arsenal become a club that wins titles again. He’s a great coach and a great person.’\nOusmane Dembele has been axed by Enrique for PSG’s encounter with Arsenal, a decision that caught Arteta by surprise as he faced the media earlier today.\nWidespread reports in France claimed Enrique and Dembele were involved in a heated altercation following the side’s 3-1 victory over Rennes last Friday.\n‘There are difficult circumstances, difficult decisions,’ Enrique said when asked to elaborate on the situation.\n‘I am 100 per cent committed to my decisions, I am 100 per cent sure of my decisions. My decisions are not irreversible.\n‘I signed for this club to create a team with an identity, that plays football.\n‘Was I hired to win titles and win the Champions League? Certainly not. I was hired to do the best I can.\n‘I have the support of the management, the sporting director, the president. I am here to create a team and to do it also with Ousmane Dembele.’\nEnrique hopes to avoid the matter becoming a ‘soap opera’ which he fears could become a distraction ahead of such a crucial game.\nMore Trending\n‘I have nothing to add to what I said before,’ he went on.\n‘You already have enough to work with, if you want. I am honest but I do not want to make a soap opera out of this matter.\n‘There is no dispute between the two of us, that is totally false.\n‘There is a problem of commitment of the player towards the team but not a problem between the player and the coach.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Arsenal fans rejoice as Mikel Merino is spotted back in training after injury\nMORE: Mikel Arteta reveals Arsenal star was ‘emotional’ after new injury scare\nMORE: Declan Rice responds to claims Arsenal are ‘cheating’ in Premier League matches",
