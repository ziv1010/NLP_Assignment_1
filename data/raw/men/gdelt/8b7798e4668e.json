  "body_text": "Will this finally be Arsenal's year, as Mikel Arteta targets his first major trophy since lifting the FA Cup in 2020, with Gooners everywhere dreaming of a first Premier League title since 2004?\nWhat are Arsenal's confirmed transfers?\nArsenal's arrivals\n- Viktor Gyökeres: Sporting CP - £63.7 million.\n- Martín Zubimendi: Real Sociedad - £55.8 million.\n- Noni Madueke: Chelsea - £52 million.\n- Cristhian Mosquera: Valencia - £13 million.\n- Christian Nørgaard: Brentford - £11 million.\n- Kepa Arrizabalaga: Chelsea - £5 million.\nArsenal's departures\n- Jorginho: Flamengo - free transfer.\n- Kieran Tierney: Celtic - free transfer.\n- Thomas Partey: Villarreal - free transfer.\n- Takehiro Tomiyasu: free agent.\n- Nuno Tavares: Lazio - £7.6 million.\n- Marquinhos: Cruzeiro - £3 million.\n- Nathan Butler-Oyedeji: Lausanne-Sport - free transfer.\nPleased note: all information is correct as of the date of publication.\nWhat happened at Arsenal last season?\nChants of \"second again olé olé\" were sung by opposition supporters during every Arsenal game in the final few weeks of the season and well, in a nutshell, that's the story. The Gunners have finished as Premier League runners-up in each of the last three seasons, only the fifth team in English football history to do this, after Arsenal themselves (99-01), Leeds (70-72), Manchester United (47-49) and Preston North End (1891-93). No club has ever been runners-up four years in a row, yet at least.\nHowever, last season's second-place finish was undoubtably different to the other two. Under Mikel Arteta, the Gunners had improved their points tally even single season since he arrived in 2019, running Manchester City extremely close both times, but last year they regressed by a huge 15 points, also scoring 22 fewer goals, losing only four league games, but killed by 14 draws.\nWhat gave Arsenal's season life in the spring was their Champions League adventure, reaching the competition's semi-finals for only the third time ever. They historically steamrollered Real Madrid in the quarter-finals, prevailing 5-1 on aggregate. Declan Rice's two free-kicks in 12 minutes in North London, as well as Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli's goals at the Bernabéu will never be remembered for a very long time. Nevertheless, it's now five years without major silverware, a pair of FA Community Shields not withstanding, so now has to be the time Arteta delivers some silverware.\nHow will Arsenal do this season?\nIn an attempt to shake off the always the bridesmaid, never the bride tag, Arsenal have recruited heavily in the summer. The most exciting acquisition is striker Viktor Gyökeres, arriving from Sporting CP for around £63 million, having scored 97 goals in 102 appearances for the Portuguese giants, not bad numbers. Arguably though, Martín Zubimendi could be the most-important addition, joining from Real Sociedad, brought in to be the starting defensive midfield, following key departures.\nElsewhere, Arteta has recognised that he needs depth, after Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz, Benjamin White, Gabriel, Gabriel Martinelli, Martin Ødegaard, Gabriel Jesus and Riccardo Calafiori all suffered long-term injuries throughout last season, severely hampering their title aspirations.\nThus, Noni Madueke will add to his attacking options, while Christian Nørgaard and Cristhian Mosquera could also prove astute signings too. Whether or not the Gunners have done enough to bridge the gap to Liverpool remains to be seen, but they certainly boast a strong squad, one capable of contending for all four trophies, but will any one of them end up in North London?\nWhat is our predicted Premier League finish for Arsenal?\n- Our predicted finish for Arsenal in the Premier League this season: 2nd.\nWhat are Arsenal's first 6 Premier League fixtures?\n- Manchester United (A). Sunday 17 August. Kick off 16:30 (BST).\n- Leeds United (H). Saturday 23 August. Kick off 17:30 (BST).\n- Liverpool (A). Sunday 31 August. Kick off 16:30 (BST).\n- Nottingham Forest (H).
