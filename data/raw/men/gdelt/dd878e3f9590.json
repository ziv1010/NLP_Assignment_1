  "body_text": "Matt Targett could be the surprise boost Newcastle United didn’t know they needed\nThis Newcastle United season so far has been a rollercoaster.\nBig performances and wins in the Champions League, combined with some dropped Premier League points and concerning performances against bottom half of the table teams.\nAreas of the squad have been stretched, but of all the areas that have raised eyebrows among fans, the left-back position has been one of the biggest talking points.\nWith Lewis Hall returning from injury and Dan Burn struggling in that role, one solution is quietly sitting 30 or so miles down the road in Middlesbrough.\nRecalling Matt Targett might not be the headline grabbing move some supporters crave but it could be a sensible decision the club makes.\nTargett has started the majority of Middlesbrough’s games this season and has even got on the scoresheet twice. With the Championship club currently sitting second in the league, his experience so far has been a positive one.\nHis time at Newcastle United has been inconsistent due to injuries and line-up preference.\nWhen he arrived on Tyneside in January 2022, he was integral to Newcastle’s journey to survival and looked a very wise acquisition. Calm on the ball, disciplined defensively, and capable of giving the left side balance.\nHe was the first choice left-back going into Eddie Howe’s first full campaign, but with an injury putting him on the sidelines, the new signing that season Sven Botman was given the centre-back spot, with Dan Burn moving out to the left-hand side. The result of this was an incredibly strong formula, with the team statistically having the best defensive record, joint with the Champions that season, Manchester City.\nLooking to build on this were the arrivals of Lewis Hall and Tino Livramento. Once fully settled in, the two young full-backs have not looked back since. They both are now first names on the team sheet. They could even be on the plane together next summer as part of Thomas Tuchel’s England World Cup squad.\nDespite the strong and critical attributes both players possess, they have sustained bad injuries over the last twelve months. It’s imperative Newcastle keep the two players fit this season but rotation may need to play a part in that.\nKieran Trippier is a strong backup to Livramento in that right-back position, with Emil Krafth also an option if needed. However, the only natural left-back Newcastle have is Hall, and it seems evident Burn has lost the ability to play in that position.\nA big benefit of recalling Targett is that he doesn’t need time to settle. He knows Howe’s system. He knows the players. He knows the club. And it shores up a weak spot, allowing Howe to use Burn in his more natural centre-back role.\nSometimes football solutions are staring you right in the face.\nAnd right now, Matt Targett, experienced, Premier League-ready, and already part of the club’s fabric, looks like exactly that.\n(Simon also has his very own blog which you can visit here)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
