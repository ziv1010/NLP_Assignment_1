  "body_text": "Former Sky Sports presenter Jeff Stelling has snubbed Manchester United and Chelsea in his shock Premier League top-four prediction.\nThe 2024-25 Premier League season gets underway on Friday night with Erik ten Hag’s United, who finished eighth last term, facing Fulham at Old Trafford.\nDefending champions Manchester City kick-start their title defence on Sunday with a trip to Stamford Bridge to take on big-spending Chelsea.\nCity are favourites to win an unprecedented fifth successive Premier League title but Stelling believes Pep Guardiola’s stranglehold over the trophy is set to come to an end.\nIf Man City do slip up, Arsenal appear best placed to take advantage following back-to-back second-place finishes under Mikel Arteta, but Stelling has also overlooked the Gunners.\nInstead, the popular presenter has backed Jurgen Klopp’s replacement Arne Slot to win the Premier League in his first season at Liverpool.\nStelling does not expect Arsenal and Manchester City to drop off so drastically as to miss out on next season’s Champions League and has tipped Newcastle United to secure the final top-four spot.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nThat would represent more disappointment for Premier League giants Manchester United and Chelsea following their respective struggles last season, while it would also leave Aston Villa and Tottenham outside the top-four.\n‘I’ve got Arsenal second, but I haven’t gone for the title winner you might expect,’ Stelling told talkSPORT. ‘I’m going for Liverpool to win the title.\n‘They had a wobble last season and that cost them. People are making a great deal about the lack of signings but equally they haven’t had any significant losses either.\n‘I think a lot of the young players will be better. People will think why are you overlooking Man City and I just think the team has been chipped away a bit over the last few years.\nJeff Stelling's top-four prediction\n- Liverpool\n- Arsenal\n- Manchester City\n- Newcastle United\n‘Those 115 charges hanging over them must have an effect too. So I’ve gone for Liverpool, Arsenal and Man City as the top-three.\n‘I don’t think Man United have enough depth and I would rule Chelsea right out [of the top-four race].\n‘If [Dominic] Solanke comes off I think Spurs have a chance and Aston Villa do too if they can cope with the Champions League.\n‘Newcastle had a lot of injuries last season and I know a lot of clubs did but if they stay relatively injury-free I think they can get fourth.’\nMeanwhile, a new Betfair survey of more than 2,000 football fans has revealed that Anfield is the stadium with the best atmosphere in the Premier League.\nThe poll, conducted by YouGov Sport, also found fans up and down the country are largely resigned to Manchester City winning the title for a fifth straight year, while supporters believe the top four will be made up by Arsenal, Liverpool and Man United.\nThis weekend, thousands of supporters will be cheering on their teams away from home, and people surveyed can’t be split on who the title of best away fans should go to, with Newcastle and Liverpool supporters both sharing top spot.\nPremier League top-four odds\nMan City 1/12\nArsenal 1/10\nLiverpool 8/15\nChelsea 6/4\nTottenham, Man United 13/8\nNewcastle 2/1\nAston Villa 10/3\nOdds courtesy of Betfair\nWhen asked who the worst away fans are, Arsenal got over the line to clinch that title.\nSpeaking from experience about stadiums with the best atmosphere, Betfair Ambassador Alan Shearer said: ‘St James’ Park has always been a special place.\nMore Trending\n‘Anfield is always a unique atmosphere – even as an opposing player, stood there listening to You’ll Never Walk Alone, it’s a really good atmosphere.\n‘When I played at Anfield with Blackburn and won the league that was a very different atmosphere, because the Liverpool fans didn’t want Man United to win the league, yet they wanted Liverpool to win, and they also wanted Kenny Dalglish to win it for Blackburn, that was a different atmosphere but a unique one and one that I enjoyed.\n‘I always remember getting the goal to beat Jackie Milburn’s record. The atmosphere was off the charts at St James’ Park and if I could’ve bottled up that atmosphere it would’ve been amazing.\n‘For me to go away, learn my trade and come back ten years later, then to break the record in front of the Gallowgate End where I used to stand as a young kid – it doesn’t get any better than that for me.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Former Chelsea and Barcelona defender desperate to complete shock Man Utd transfer\nMORE: Man Utd legend Jaap Stam claims Erik ten Hag signing is ‘not good enough for this level’\nMORE: Mikel Arteta concerns saw Arsenal pull out of race for £54m Chelsea signing Pedro Neto",
