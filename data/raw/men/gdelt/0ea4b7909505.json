  "body_text": "Arsenal – 6\nArsenal fell short again. Despite Man City finishing third, the Gunners ended up ten points off the top. Divided fan opinion, injuries, red cards, and conservative tactics contributed to a frustrating season. Arteta’s January admission that the squad lacked attacking depth came back to bite. The Champions League run offered promise, but questionable substitutions in the semi-final raised concerns.\nAston Villa – 6\nVilla enjoyed a strong European campaign, including a memorable win over Bayern. However, they faltered domestically, missing out on the top five and the FA Cup final. Big wages and potential summer exits hint at financial balancing ahead.\nBrentford – 8\nLosing Ivan Toney seemed a risk, but the club thrived. Muembo and Wissa stepped up impressively. Thomas Frank continues to overachieve and adapt his tactics, especially away from home. A record unbeaten away run capped a smart, well-executed season.\nBrighton – 8\nThe youngest manager in Premier League history, Fabian Hurzeler, implemented bold ideas and had Brighton pushing for Europe. A post-FA Cup slump cost them a place in Europe, but the club’s steady rise continues.\nBournemouth – 8\nIraola’s brave tactics brought identity and results, including historic wins over City and Arsenal. High pressing and fluid attacks impressed, though fatigue showed late in the season. 56 points is a club record.\nChelsea – 7\nA top-four finish and a trophy won did not silence critics. Maresca implemented a settled side, but slow football and inconsistent form caused fan frustration. Celebrating Champions League qualification showed how expectations have changed.\nCrystal Palace – 9\nHistoric FA Cup win and a huge mentality shift under Glasner. A poor start gave way to peak form at the right time. Eze and Mateta led a rejuvenated squad to glory.\nEverton – 7\nAvoiding relegation ahead of their stadium move was the priority. Dyche and Moyes delivered stability, if not excitement. The team defended well and were hard to beat.\nFulham – 7\nA solid season, but they let key results slip. Taking points off the top clubs but losing to the bottom three highlights inconsistency. Dropped points from winning positions stung.\nIpswich – 3\nThe jump from League One to the Premier League proved too steep. Despite some memorable results, a Championship-level defence cost them. Fans remain supportive.\nLeicester – 2\nOff-field decisions undermined their season. Relegation confirmed amid questions over planning and leadership. Van Nistelrooy did not appear fully committed.\nLiverpool – 9\nUnexpected title winners with Salah and Van Dijk outstanding. Slot wisely made minimal changes. The only blemish was fan treatment of Alexander-Arnold. Physically faded late in the season, but no one capitalised.\nManchester City – 4\nThird place, 13 points behind the leaders. Rodri’s injury exposed defensive weaknesses, and Pep’s side looked less confident. A summer rebuild appears likely as De Bruyne exits.\nManchester United – 1\nA disaster of a season. Fifteenth in the table, a lack of identity, and instability on and off the pitch. Amorim inherits a mess. The club’s future looks deeply uncertain.\nNewcastle – 9\nCarabao Cup win, tactical masterclasses from Howe, and Champions League qualification. A dream season on Tyneside. Tonali’s return and clever rotation played key roles.\nNottingham Forest – 8\nFrom survival to European football. Santos’ counter-attacking approach worked well, though the FA Cup exit triggered a dip in form. An emotional season that exceeded expectations.\nSouthampton – 2\nRelegated with minimal fight. Martin stuck to his principles, but playing out from the back proved costly. A historic low points total narrowly avoided.\nSpurs – 4\nEuropa League winners, but a dreadful domestic campaign. Postecoglou’s rigid tactics and poor league form raise doubts. Fans cling to European success, but concerns remain.\nWest Ham – 3\nMoyes’ exit was supposed to bring flair, but Lopetegui offered little improvement. A dull season with no clear identity or ambition. Fans may now question if change was worth it.\nWolves – 6\nO’Neil started poorly, but Pereira stabilised the squad. Discipline issues and inconsistency were evident, but finishing 16th was a recovery. Cunha’s sale may prompt more exits.\nLet us know your grades in the comments, and remember to be respectful of each other’s views.\nDan Smith\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\nADMIN COMMENT\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans.
