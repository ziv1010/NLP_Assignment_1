  "body_text": "It is now five fixtures without a victory for Eddie Howe and his team and while nobody would suggest that pre-season results count for very much, Newcastle United cannot be accused of needlessly hoarding momentum.\nAfter a difficult summer off the pitch, the return of football to St James’ Park felt like a minor source of relief in that it shifted the conversation — for 90 minutes at least — away from the absent Alexander Isak and a frustrating transfer window.\nAdvertisement\nNo dissent was aimed towards Isak, who has expressed his desire to leave Tyneside and has been the subject of a failed £110million ($148m) bid from Liverpool, but this 2-2 draw with Espanyol did not quite resemble a statement of intent. It followed another draw with Tottenham Hotspur and defeats to Team K-League, Arsenal, and Celtic.\nHowe’s side went behind to a long-range goal from Edu Exposito and then equalised through Matt Targett, who was heavily involved for reasons good and bad. Aaron Ramsdale, the goalkeeper, saved a penalty on his debut, there was a 77th-minute goal from Jacob Murphy, and a late reply from Kike Garcia, the Espanyol substitute.\nNewcastle play their final warm-up match, again at St James’ Park, against Atletico Madrid on Saturday. Their Premier League campaign begins with a trip to Aston Villa seven days later, but in terms of new players and some big decisions, there is much work still to do.\nWhere is the “dynamism” that Howe called for?\nThe last time Eddie Howe sat in the hot seat in the St James’ press room was on the final day of last season. Newcastle lost 1-0 to Everton, but they had finished fifth in the Premier League and qualified for the Champions League. The head coach was already thinking about what was next.\nWhen Howe spoke about transfers, it did feel as though the media or supporters were his primary audience. He talked about a need to “be dynamic. We have to be ready to complete things very, very quickly because good players don’t hang around for long”.\nThat was May 25. Three months later, Newcastle have signed Ramsdale and Anthony Elanga, but they have also missed out on a plethora of signings — Bryan Mbeumo, James Trafford, Joao Pedro, Liam Delap, Hugo Ekitike, Benjamin Sesko — either through being rejected or gazumped. Paul Mitchell, the sporting director, has long since left and is yet to be replaced.\n“Dynamic” does not feel like the right description of how things have unfolded.\nHowe was asked about that, about what has (or has not) happened. He did not cast any blame.\n“I think the club has been dynamic, I think the club has been proactive,” he insisted. “We have tried, but through no fault of anyone that’s working behind the scenes, we haven’t been able to close some deals that, at one stage, looked very close. They just got away from us, but that can happen to any deal until it’s signed, sealed and delivered.\nAdvertisement\n“The competition and the smaller pool of players we have is very small, so everyone’s fighting for the same players, and we’ve lost out on a number of deals that could have fallen our way.”\nCan this still be a successful window?\n“Yeah, it can,” Howe said. “Signing players doesn’t guarantee anything. We didn’t sign many last summer and everyone said it was a disastrous window and how PSR is affecting our long-term success, and we went on to have one of the best seasons in recent memory. But, obviously, if you get it right, it can take your squad forward to a different area. We are very keen to add new stimulus to the group. Let’s see what happens.”\nHow was Aaron Ramsdale’s debut?\nThere was one new signing on display, two if you include Park Seung-soo, the young South Korean winger who joined from Suwon Bluewings last month and made a couple of lively cameo appearances on Newcastle’s tour to east Asia.\nIn terms of senior players, it was Ramsdale, fresh from agreeing a season-long loan from Southampton, a deal which includes an option to become permanent. The 27-year-old was not Howe’s first-choice target, but after a year-long pursuit of Trafford, Newcastle lost out to Manchester City, which has been a familiar kind of story.\nWith Martin Dubravka moving to Burnley, Ramsdale will vie for a place with Nick Pope, who is the current number one.\nSaving a penalty will do his cause no harm. Ramsdale had little chance with Exposito’s 17th-minute goal, which was struck with venom from outside the box, but he got down quickly and with confidence to repel Javier Puado’s kick from the spot, a big moment in a low-key game. There was also a lovely late save from a Tyrhys Dolan effort before Espanyol’s equaliser.\nMaking an impression on his first appearance! 🧤 pic.twitter.com/i7RzVpkEbS\n— Newcastle United (@NUFC) August 8, 2025\nHowe explained the logic behind Ramsdale’s signing. “He’s a more rounded goalkeeper now than the young player I signed at Bournemouth,” he said. “He’s ready to come into the squad and really add his value. He’s a great character, a really positive guy, very popular in the dressing room with his team-mates, and so I think he’ll add a lot. It was a top save from a penalty and he distributed the ball really well. It was a really good home debut from him.”\nNimbleness on his feet is one differential from Pope.\nAdvertisement\nMatt Targett is not stuck in Seoul\nMatt Targett went viral the other day when a (very funny) spoof account on X — looking at you, @FrancisChipp — posted that the defender had “accidentally” been left behind in South Korea, with the club only discovering “he was not on board yesterday’s return flight upon its arrival back into Newcastle”.\nEXCLUSIVE🚨 : Newcastle United have accidentally left defender Matt Targett in Seoul, South Korea. The club discovered he was not on board yesterday’s return flight upon its arrival back into Newcastle.\nThe club has confirmed he is safe and will board a flight home later today. pic.twitter.com/3sFonDFjRw\n— Francis (@FrancisChipp) August 5, 2025\nSafe to say, this is the most attention Targett has received for quite some time. He clearly enjoys notoriety.\nWith England’s Lewis Hall at left-back and starting his first match since suffering a foot injury in February, Targett began against Espanyol in the centre of midfield, a development which was both unexpected and proved very eventful. Let’s call it an interesting experiment.\nTargett gave the ball away for Espanyol’s first goal. He then powered in a header for Newcastle’s equaliser, meeting Lewis Miley’s cross. In the 38th minute, he dangled out a leg and Roberto Fernandez tripped over it, thereby winning a penalty. It sounds a bit cruel, but perhaps it would have been better all round if he had stayed in Seoul. At least his team-mate Fabian Schar was glad to have Targett around after the full-back’s fictional stranding.\nThe return of Hall, whose development was one of the highlights of last season, was very timely. He looked aggrieved when he was told at half-time that he was coming off, but his quality and that hunger to play — and play for Newcastle — is vital. It was also in contrast to Isak, who Howe said he “can’t involve with the group”.\nAt this point, anything that resembles good news, or dredges up half a laugh, is very welcome.\nWhat next for Newcastle?\nSaturday, August 9: Atletico Madrid (Home), pre-season friendly, 4pm UK, 11am ET\n(Top photo: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United via Getty Images)",
