For me, it wouldn’t have any reflect on the Champions League game.\n“Champions League is Champions League and it’s different from league matches. Real Madrid over the years have shown that they are specialist in the Champions League and they know how to get things done.\n“Even if you’re leading Real Madrid with one or two goals towards the end of 90 minutes don’t be rest assured that you have won the game untill the final whistle is blown before you can jubilate for winning Real Madrid.\n“So they know how to pull up surprises, they know how to pull strings together to get their desire results in the Champions League.\n“So it’s going to be a tough game between both sides, an intriguing and exciting game to watch out for. To me personally, I think their last league games wouldn’t have any effect on the game.\n“It will depend on the team performances and [Bukayo] Saka is back from injury and unfortunately Arsenal defender Gabriel is out with injury and it’s a huge blow to Arsenal.\n“But Real Madrid are in best shape but the return of Saka is also a boost to the attacking threat of Arsenal, so it would be a great encounter between both sides,” he added.\nSpeaking on what fans should expect from the Arsenal versus Real Madrid clash, Afolabi added:\n“Fans should brace-up for an exciting football match between two attacking sides. Both teams have great attacking potentials in their squads.\n“So it would be a great game to watch for fans all over the world because seeing an English team playing an attacking football and a Spanish giants who are also known for their attacking style of play coming together, it’s going to be a great swift of an attacking display.\n“Much more we would learn from this game is going to be the defensive prowess of both sides because you can’t dispute the fact that both teams are good at attacking.\n“One major factor that would come to play is the defenders. It matters how defenders can be on top of their game and make sure they stop the attacking threat of their opponent.\n“So much work will be on the defenders and not the strikers. So the fans should come watch the best of football,” he stated.\nDAILY POST reports that the return fixture of Arsenal vs Real Madrid tie will take place next week Wednesday at the Santiago Bernabeu in Spain.",
