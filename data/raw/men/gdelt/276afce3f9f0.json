Inter Milan are a decent team, they haven’t let in a goal this season in the Champions League, they were in the final the other year, they were unfortunate to get knocked out last year against Atletico Madrid.\n‘It was a good performance. I thought the only thing that was missing is that little bit of guile. They dominated the game, should have come away with a draw but it’s just that little bit of guile.\n‘Arsenal have earned the right now in Europe where teams are going to sit back against them, they’ve earned that respect, then they need an Odegaard who is going to put the ball through the eye of a needle.\n‘At the moment, they haven’t got that when Odegaard isn’t playing.’\nArsenal have clearly lacked creativity in the middle of the park while Odegaard has been sidelined with an ankle injury and fans will have breathed a collective sigh of relief as the Norwegian replaced Kai Havertz in the closing stages in Milan.\nAsked whether Odegaard should be thrown back into Arteta’s XI against Chelsea, Merson replied: ‘I think that comes down to this weekend and the results.\n‘Arsenal play second on Super Sunday so they’ll know how Liverpool and City have got on. If they’ve both won then I think Odegaard has got to start the game.\n‘Ten and nine points, if both those teams win, that’s a lot of points and, for me, it would be a must-win football match and you take a chance [on Odegaard].\n‘Otherwise, what do you do? Do you bring him on for the last 20-30 minutes and then he goes and plays for Norway for a couple of games in seven or eight days? Unless he’s not going away with Norway and then maybe you sort of save him.\n‘But if not, I think he’s got to be thrown back in. He’s that important to Arsenal.’\nMore Trending\nSpeaking shortly after Arsenal’s loss to Inter, a bullish Arteta insisted his side were more than capable of defeating Chelsea if they produced a similar display in west London this weekend.\n‘If we play the way we played against Inter then we have a big chance to win against Chelsea,’ the Arsenal head coach told reporters at his post-match press conference.\n‘That’s the way we have to go. I told them that I’m proud of them, I haven’t seen them play in Europe in the manner that we played today.\n‘We are very disappointed because we didn’t get what we wanted out of the game, that’s for sure.’\nWhat will the result be at Stamford Bridge?\n-\nChelsea win\n-\nDraw\n-\nArsenal win\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Brighton injury latest on Joao Pedro, Matt O’Riley, Lewis Dunk and Yankuba Minteh\nMORE: Man Utd identify two targets for January transfer window under Ruben Amorim\nMORE: Chelsea told player they sold for £10m is ‘good enough’ for Manchester City and Arsenal",
