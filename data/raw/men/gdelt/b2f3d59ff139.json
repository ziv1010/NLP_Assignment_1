  "body_text": "“Come on, I’ve already answered a question about this twice,” said a clearly annoyed Hansi Flick in the post-match press room at Club Brugge.\nAnother reporter had asked about concerns over his Barcelona side’s playing style, after a 3-3 draw in the Champions League that again exposed the flaws in their aggressively high defensive line.\nAdvertisement\nIt is rare to see Flick angry — he tends to keep his cool, even when asked obviously irrelevant questions. This time, he was annoyed precisely because the question was a very good one… and he knew it.\nThe heart of the matter is this: Barcelona enjoyed great success using this risky defensive approach last season, as they won a domestic treble and reached the Champions League semi-finals. So far in 2025-26, there have been many signs that teams have worked them out, even before last night.\nWednesday’s draw in Belgium is not in itself a desperate problem, especially at this early stage of the league phase, with clubs still having half of their eight matches to play. But there is real concern that this team lack direction in the defensive side of their game right now. When Barca have the ball, they more than hold their own. When they don’t, they are a disaster.\nThree times Club Brugge went in front last night, three times Barca pegged them back — before being saved by a VAR call that ruled out a late winner for the home side.\n“Teams are causing us a lot of danger with counter-attacks — with two passes they are in our area,” Barcelona centre-back Eric Garcia told Spanish broadcasters Movistar Plus after the game. “Obviously, we have to improve. Today, the team reacted well, we had lots of chances. But when you score, and then they immediately hit back, it’s tough to take.\n“I don’t think it’s about the defenders. We all attack, we all defend. Sometimes we lose possession in difficult areas, which makes it easier for opponents, and is something we need to stop doing.”\nBarca did indeed lose a lot of balls in midfield last night, and there were individual errors in defence that weighed the team down.\nFor the Club Brugge opener just six minutes in, Alejandro Balde and Garcia tried to step forward to spring an offside trap, but their fellow defenders Ronald Araujo and Jules Kounde were not in unison and ended up leaving Carlos Forbs through on goal.\nThis has been a recurring theme over the early months of the season.\nAdvertisement\nFlick’s system works if all 11 players are focused and working together. If they maintain pressure and the defensive line is synchronised, it brings great reward. If not, things fall apart.\n“We don’t want to defend in a low block and then do some transition to win 1-0,” Flick said at his press conference. “We came back after every goal, which is a positive thing, but we have to talk about this match. We are Barca. Our football is to be active and with intensity.”\nHe’s right. Barca did create many chances, and they scored three away goals, but if things carry on like this, they will have to get four or five each game to win.\nIn this regard, one name stands out: Lamine Yamal. In recent matches, he has not been the player we all know. He has looked tired. The physical problems of his groin issue and a lack of rhythm seemed to be taking their toll.\nWednesday was the first match this season in which we saw the 18-year-old at his very best. He tried everything, even dropping back to defend when necessary. He carried the team on his back and showed signs of wanting to win the game on his own, but nobody could follow. He made eight crosses but nobody was able to finish them off.\nBarca’s final two goals of the game both bore his signature — and the team’s second was a work of art.\nYamal received the ball on the edge of the area, dribbled past three defenders with a ‘croqueta’ and passed to Fermin Lopez, who returned the ball to him with a backheel. Yamal made another change of pace and, with a subtle flick of the outside of his boot, scored to make it 2-2.\nBut then, in the very next move after that goal, Club Brugge almost scored again. That was this match in microcosm.\nWith Barcelona lacking ideas, the ball kept coming to Yamal to try to resolve the match, to see what he was capable of. But can Flick’s side keep relying on his brilliance to dig them out? The answer is probably no.\nAdvertisement\nThe team have to be able to survive without him or, when he can’t play due to injury, rest or suspension, they’re likely to be done for. Barca have to regain their intensity and function as a well-oiled machine again.\nOne year ago, Flick dubbed a run of poor results at this time of year a “s*** November”. Twelve months on, he could make the same statement and nobody would be surprised, except that this time it hasn’t just been November. His team have been struggling for months.\nPerhaps everything will be resolved when their many missing players (including Pedri, Joan Garcia, Raphinha, Dani Olmo and Robert Lewandowski) are all finally back and fully up to speed.\nIn the meantime, they have Yamal, who returned to his best form before his team did.",
