In the second leg, he opened the scoring with a 25-yard free kick that pinged in off the far post. After two Fiorentina goals had levelled the tie, an unselfish assist for his team-mate Abde Ezzalzouli sent the Seville-based La Liga side through to their first European final.\nOn the final whistle, Antony broke into tears, shrugging off embraces from team-mates as he soaked in the acclaim of the travelling Betis fans.\nANTONIO 𝐈 DE TRIANA. pic.twitter.com/tY9FLg0nux\n— Real Betis Balompié 🌴💚 (@RealBetis) May 8, 2025\n“They were tears of joy, but of relief too,” Antony said on Movistar TV during an interview on the pitch. “I’ve been through a very difficult moment in my life. Only my family and I know what happened with us. I’ve cried a lot — with my mother, my wife, my sister. Now I’m living this dream, this incredible moment. I’m very happy.”\nBefore Wednesday’s Conference League final against Chelsea in Wroclaw, Poland, Antony has nine goals and five assists in 25 games for Betis. He has been widely acclaimed as one of the best players in Spain during the second half of the season.\nThe contrast is startling with his situation just six months ago, when he was not wanted at United, and his entire career appeared in the balance following allegations of assault against a former partner that Greater Manchester Police are still investigating.\nAfter his £84.1million (€95m, $105.1m) signing from Ajax in August 2022, Antony’s United career actually began quite well. His first season at Old Trafford included goals against Arsenal, Manchester City and Barcelona, and he also played for Brazil at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\nIn September 2023, United released a statement saying they had agreed to “delay Antony’s return” from international duty with Brazil after police launched an investigation due to his former partner, Gabriela Cavallin, making allegations of assault against him. Antony denied those allegations and similar ones by two other women (Rayssa de Freitas and Ingrid Lana) made in Brazilian media.\nAdvertisement\nAfter a month away from the team, Antony returned to the United squad but he never regained a regular place in the starting XI. Through the first half of the 2024-25 season, he made only three starts, and 14 appearances in total. The current head coach, Ruben Amorim, used him in 287 minutes across nine games, during which time Antony produced zero goals and zero assists.\nThe case in Brazil closed in August 2024, but the Greater Manchester Police investigation into alleged incidents said to have occurred in the United Kingdom was still open when Betis made their move at the start of 2025.\nA source at Betis, speaking anonymously to protect their job, said the club were aware of the situation before completing the loan deal, that they knew the Brazil case had been closed and that United had brought the player back into their first-team setup. Betis has a clear policy against any type of abuse, including violence against women, the source said, but the club also accepts the presumption of innocence until found guilty.\nIn August 2023, Spanish police investigated allegations made against the Betis midfielder William Carvalho, relating to an incident in a Seville hotel. A judge dismissed that case in May 2024. Further back, the Betis forward Ruben Castro was charged in February 2015 with alleged domestic abuse, then acquitted in June 2017. Both players continued to play for Betis during these legal proceedings, and neither La Liga nor the Spanish federation took any action.\nThe police investigations against Antony were rarely mentioned when he arrived in the Andalusian capital in January. Local media profiles focused on his very difficult upbringing in a Sao Paulo favela called ‘En Inferninho’ (Little Hell), and the poverty and violence he experienced first-hand as a child. There has been none of the scrutiny from media and opposition fans that occurred when Mason Greenwood moved on loan from Manchester United to Getafe last season.\nAntony himself was clearly delighted to join Betis, and especially with the welcome he received.\nAdvertisement\n“When the opportunity arose to come to Betis, my head was already here,” Antony told Betis TV soon after arriving. “I love the club, the city, everything. The sunshine, the people, the food: it reminds me of Brazil. And most importantly, I’ve found myself. I wasn’t playing much (at United). I needed to be happy in myself.”\nBetis were also in trouble when Antony arrived, after a run of one win in nine La Liga games, and a 5-1 Copa del Rey exit against Barcelona. His first game was a 2-2 draw at home to Athletic Bilbao on February 2, and his first goal came in a 3-2 defeat at Celta Vigo on February 8.\nBut Manuel Pellegrini’s team started to find form, with the former Real Madrid galactico Isco returning to fitness and Antony settling into the side.\nA spectacular volley from the Brazilian opened the scoring in a 3-0 win over Real Sociedad in mid-February and the following week at Getafe, he skipped past two players to set up a goal for Isco. He was then sent off for a late lunge on Getafe’s Juan Iglesias with Betis 2-1 up in stoppage time.\nBetis successfully overturned the red card and Antony starred in the following week’s 2-1 win over Real Madrid at the Benito Villamarin. The momentum continued with another fine solo goal in a 4-0 win at Vitoria Guimaraes, which sent Betis through to the Conference League quarter-finals.\n🤤🔝⚽️\n— Real Betis Balompié 🌴💚 (@RealBetis) March 14, 2025\nNah… es otro rollo. pic.twitter.com/HcZXjgJ5HY\nThe comparison with his output during his last 18 months at United is striking; his numbers across all metrics — goals, assists, touches, carries — are far superior with Betis.\n“(Antony) is getting back to enjoying his football,” Isco told The Athletic in March. “He needed a change of air, and Betis has the best air there is. He’s surprised me, on a personal level and as a footballer. I’m happy that a player of his level is here at Betis.”\nAdvertisement\nDuring the Betis coach Pellegrini’s five years at the Andalusian club, many talented and creative players, including Isco, Sergio Canales and Giovani Lo Celso, have bounced back from difficult moments in their careers.\n“Antony is a special case,” the former Madrid and Manchester City manager Pellegrini said in March. “You don’t just pay €100m for a player by chance. He came here convinced that he had to mature, the last year at United might have given him some of that, and he has talent to spare. It was a difficult time for him but he showed his bravery by coming here and took it as a personal challenge.”\nThe best of Antony’s goals for Betis was arguably a 91st-minute winner at Espanyol — a curling left-foot shot from the corner of the penalty area into the far top corner.\nSuch moments have made Antony a big name in Spain and La Liga have felt comfortable using his popularity to promote the league online. This month, he was interviewed for the exclusive Universo Valdano series on Movistar TV hosted by former Madrid player, coach and director Jorge Valdano.\n“The most important thing to play football is to be happy,” Antony told Valdano. “Then you see that on the pitch. I’ve been smiling since my first day here.”\nIn the build-up to the Conference League final, he spoke to TNT Sports Brasil about his time at United and settling in Spain.\n“I needed to rediscover myself. I wanted to do things (on the pitch) but it just wasn’t happening for me,” he said. “I wasn’t happy, wasn’t feeling that desire to play football.\n“I always told my brother, ‘I can’t do it anymore.’ He would tell me, ‘Just hang in there a bit longer, things will change.’ It makes me emotional because that was a very difficult time for me.\n“Only I know how hard it was there at home. I didn’t have the strength to play with my son. There were days when I didn’t eat, didn’t leave my bedroom. It was tough. Thanks to family and God, I was able to turn things around.”\nAdvertisement\nGiven the impression Antony has made, many at Betis have been thinking about how to keep him beyond his current loan deal.\n“We’ll have to do a crowdfunding to bring him here another year at least,” Isco told DAZN after Betis’ La Liga ‘derbi’ victory against neighbours Sevilla in late March.\n“If I have to provide the car to kidnap him, I will,” the Betis legend Joaquin told Movistar TV before the Conference League semi-final first leg against Fiorentina. “However it happens, he has to stay.”\nThis contrasted with the feeling back at United whenever news of his performances reached Old Trafford. In March, Amorim said the difference was “physicality” had been a problem for Antony in the Premier League, with the Brazilian’s agent hitting back and criticising “the way he was managed in Manchester”.\nAfter United representatives attended the Fiorentina first leg, talks were held with Betis about Antony’s future, with further discussions due once the season ends. Sources at United, speaking anonymously to protect their jobs, told The Athletic this week that another loan was a possibility, but the club usually preferred sales when looking to move on players, and Antony’s form at Betis means there will likely be a ‘strong market’ for him.\nWere he to be sold, United require a £32.5million fee to avoid a loss under the Premier League’s profit and sustainability regulations.\nBetis’ finances have improved in recent years, but they still must wheel and deal within La Liga’s strict salary rules. Champions League football would have been a huge financial boost, but Pellegrini’s side finished sixth in La Liga and instead will play in the Europa League next season. The club could conceivably cover all of Antony’s wages for a season, but a fee of £32.5m or more would be a stretch.\n“To buy Antony outright would be very, very difficult,” Betis president Angel Haro told COPE radio this month. “We’ll have a meeting with Manchester to extend the loan for another year, to be able to share a percentage of the player… it’s about seeing the predisposition of the player, and of Manchester.”\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, the Greater Manchester Police investigation into alleged assault remains open. A Betis source said that any player found guilty of such a crime could not represent the club.\nThe feeling at the Benito Villamarin was clear in last Friday’s final La Liga game of the season — a 1-1 draw with Valencia. When Antony scored another spectacular volley, most of the 51,141 crowd chanted for him to stay, and the ‘Antonio of Triana’ jersey held up during his celebration again underlined the connection he had made with the city (Triana is a humble neighbourhood of the city where many Roma people traditionally lived).\n𝔄𝔫𝔱𝔬𝔫𝔦𝔬 𝔡𝔢 𝔗𝔯𝔦𝔞𝔫𝔞.#LALIGAHighlights #RealBetisValencia pic.twitter.com/2qM1gfoZt5\n— Real Betis Balompié 🌴💚 (@RealBetis) May 23, 2025\nAntony was non-committal about his future on Friday, preferring to focus on the huge occasion of Wednesday’s final against Chelsea in Wroclaw.\nBut he did say: “Betis will always be in my life for the love everyone has shown me here.”\n(Additional contributor: Mark Critchley, Jack Lang)\n(Top photo: Gabriele Maltinti/Getty Images)",
