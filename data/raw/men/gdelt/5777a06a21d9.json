And by quite a distance at that.\nSpain's Euro 2024 hopes, in a lot of ways, rest solely on their demonstrative holding midfielder Rodri.\nHe's certainly good enough to drag them to the latter stages on his own.\nCM: Kevin De Bruyne\nCountry: Belgium\nWhen fit, Kevin De Bruyne is the most game-breaking midfielder at Euro 2024.\nLuckily for Belgium, he is actually fit right now, and will be hellbent on finally winning a trophy with the Red Devils after years of near misses and falling short.\nAM: Jude Bellingham\nCountry: England\nFresh off the back of a maiden Real Madrid campaign that dreams are made of - in which he netted 23 goals and won the UEFA Champions League - Jude Bellingham is heading to Euro 2024 with the world at his feet.\nAnd while he's already a leading candidate to win the Ballon d'Or, strong showings with England may be enough to seal it ahead of clubmate Vinicius Junior, who is seeking the same at the Copa America.\nST: Harry Kane\nCountry: England\nIs this the summer in which Harry Kane finally wins a trophy?\nIf he can replicate his form at Bayern Munich on the international stage - he bagged 44 goals and 12 assists in all competitions - then it could be.\nST: Kylian Mbappe\nCountry: France\nThe best footballer of his generation, and the best big game player heading to Euro 2024.\nAs evidence by his stunning performances at the most recent World Cup, Kylian Mbappe is a player for the big occasion and thrives under pressure.\nThe now-France captain will be expected to lead his nation to more glory this summer.",
