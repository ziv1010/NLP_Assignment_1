Sign up to receive more like this, plus exclusive analysis, insights and transfer talk straight to your inbox every week.\nSo, what’s going on at Newcastle?\nEddie Howe’s side are two points above the relegation zone and have a number of key injuries. Things could get ugly on Tyneside, and fast.\nAre you saying they could get relegated this season?\nNot exactly, but the next 30 days will be the difference between a successful season for Newcastle and one that ends in a search for a new manager and plenty of questions.\nIn the four years since the Saudi mega money takeover went through, Newcastle have spent over £800m on new players – more than double than the likes of Everton, Crystal Palace and Bournemouth.\nHaving witnessed Manchester City’s rapid rise to Premier League dominance, plenty presumed Newcastle would follow suit.\nThere are a number of reasons that hasn’t happened – the strength of the traditional Big Six combined with PSR rules have been significant blockers – but it’s meant to be going a lot better than this.\nWhere have Newcastle gone wrong?\nLet’s start with the Alexander Isak transfer, which is currently looking like a terrible deal for all parties. Liverpool broke their team to buy the Swede (and Florian Wirtz), Newcastle broke their team by delaying his sale for so long that they were scrambling for replacements, and Isak looks to have broken himself in the process.\nHad Newcastle sanctioned his sale earlier in the summer, there would have been time to address the flaws in their squad that have hampered them this season.\nAnd it’s those flaws that have left them in 14th place. A lack of squad depth has meant any injuries leaves Howe’s side looking threadbare, while his high-octane style of play leads to more injuries. It’s a vicious circle.\nHow do you think Newcastle United will perform in their upcoming fixtures?\n-\nThey'll bounce back and secure important victories.\n-\nIt will be a mixed bag, with some wins and losses.\n-\nThey'll continue to struggle against tough competition.\nHow does Eddie Howe fix Newcastle’s form?\nIt’s not all bad, yet. Newcastle are flying high in the Champions League group stage while they’re into their fourth consecutive Carabao Cup quarter-final.\nTwelve months ago Howe’s side were in mid table and went on to win their first major trophy in 70 years and qualified for the Champions League on the final day of the season.\nIf Howe can inspire a similar turnaround in form, he’ll be well on his way to becoming one of the best managers to grace St James’ Park.\nMore Trending\nTo do so he desperately needs to improve their away form. They’re yet to win away in the league this season and can often feel toothless in attack.\nIt’s a worry for Howe, whose players look like they are tiring faster than they did last season. So perhaps Newcastle need to slow their game down away from home to grind out results, something they will need to do in the coming weeks.\nThe only ‘straightforward’ game in their next nine comes at home to Burnley. The other eight? Manchester City, Everton, Tottenham, Sunderland and Chelsea in the league, Marseille and Bayern Leverkusen in the Champions League and that Carabao Cup quarter final against Fulham.\nIt’s a run of games that could put Christmas party plans on ice for Eddie Howe.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Next Tottenham manager odds make Premier League boss favourite to replace Thomas Frank\nMORE: Ruben Amorim told £9m Premier League flop would ‘suit Man Utd perfectly’\nMORE: Arsene Wenger makes ‘very confident’ Arsenal Premier League title prediction",
