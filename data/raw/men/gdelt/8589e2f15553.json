  "body_text": "Chelsea Considering Ruben Amorim As Potential Replacement For Pochettino Amidst Struggles\nAmong the candidates on Chelsea's radar is Sporting CP manager Ruben Amorim, a figure the club has been interested in for some time. Chelsea had considered Amorim before hiring Pochettino last summer. The 39-year-old has gained prominence with Sporting CP, leading them to Taca da Liga and Primeira Liga titles in his first full season. Despite his past association with Benfica, Amorim's structured style of play has won over fans, bringing Sporting their first league title in nearly two decades.\nCurrently, Sporting CP is performing well under Amorim's guidance, sitting second in the Primeira Liga, just two points behind Benfica with a game in hand. The team is also in the Europa League round of 16, set to face Atalanta. Amorim's adaptable 3-4-3 formation aligns well with Chelsea's squad, making him a potential candidate for the managerial role. However, Pochettino remains in charge, and Chelsea is likely exploring various options. Amorim's success may attract attention from other European clubs offering Champions League football.\nAlso Read:\nCristiano Ronaldo could face Saudi FA probe after obscene gesture towards fans chanting 'Messi Messi' (WATCH)\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
