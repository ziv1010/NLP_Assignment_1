  "body_text": "KINGSTON, Jamaica – Fancy Sixcity Pub in Portmore is a classic Jamaican dive, a glorified roadside stand in a largely abandoned industrial neighborhood west of Kingston. It sits in the shadow of the headquarters of Jamaican Premier League side Dunbeholden FC, which is little more than a collection of sheds and a modest training pitch. The bar itself is barely bigger than a closet, with room for four or five patrons at most.\nAdvertisement\nThe place has a small television on the wall and on Wednesday, it was tuned into a rerun of Barcelona’s Champions League encounter against Benfica from a day prior. You could barely hear the action over the trucks rumbling by on the highway outside. There was just one patron there on Wednesday afternoon. Demarae Campbell was sitting alone at the bar, sporting a Barcelona jersey and polishing off a Red Stripe. He was unimpressed by what he saw.\n“I miss them old teams,” Campbell said in Jamaican Patois. “I really do.”\nIt’s a bizarre thing to say about a club that currently sits atop La Liga’s table, one that had by then already booked a spot in the Champions League quarterfinals. To Campbell, though, no Barcelona side will ever approach the club’s glory years, from the late 2000s to the mid-aughts. And no player will ever touch Lionel Messi.\nTo Campbell, the UEFA Champions League match he’s tuned into is only an appetizer. Inter Miami, featuring not only Messi but fellow Barcelona legends Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets and Luis Suárez, are coming to Kingston. Campbell will be one of thousands who’ll descend on the country’s national stadium, colloquially referred to as “The Office,” to watch Miami take on Jamaican Premier League side Cavalier FC in Concacaf Champions Cup play Thursday night.\nOn any other team, Busquets, Suárez and Alba would be a sufficient draw. But Messi’s presence overshadows them all, and right now, Campbell and the bartender are fixated on whether Messi will even play. Until an hour or so prior, Messi’s presence on the traveling roster was uncertain, with the Argentine not having played in the club’s previous three matches. Campbell has now gathered from social media that Messi is traveling, but whether he’ll play still remains up in the air.\nJust seeing him, Campbell says, would almost be enough.\nAdvertisement\n“He’s going to love Jamaica,” Campbell, who is in his 60s, says with a laugh. “We love him here, he’s gonna love us. Only Pelé was better.”\nThe shadow of the Brazilian legend looms large in the entire Caribbean, where he was and still is widely idolized. Some 30,000 fans will fill The Office to watch Miami play, but the number won’t approach the 45,000 who showed up in 1975 to watch Pelé’s New York Cosmos face a Jamaican all-star team. Even tiny Cavalier FC has its own story about him, having faced Santos in 1971.\nSoccer has grown rapidly in popularity over the last two decades in a country where track and field (locally referred to as athletics) is still king. Cricket, too, has its own strong following on the island, but Jamaican football clubs have made inroads recently. Cavalier’s head coach, Rudolph Speid, sees the encounter with Messi as an obvious means to continue growing the game.\n“I think it will inspire a generation of players in Jamaica,” Speid told the media in attendance before the first leg of the series. “In the return leg, where we expect a packed stadium, and everybody talking about the game. That inspiration is much more for the country than just our team.”\nThe Kingston-based club normally plays its matches in a 3,000-seat venue that sits next to The Office but moved things next door for the Miami game. JPL matches are typically sparsely-attended affairs, with tickets frequently going for around $5. “Premium” tickets for the Miami match are nearly $300, though cheaper options remain available. As of Wednesday night, a handful of $20 tickets remained.\nAmerican fans pay much, much more — hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars — to see Messi in person. Buy the plane ticket far enough in advance, and an Inter Miami fan would likely spend less to see this match in Kingston than they would to attend an MLS match at Chase Stadium, Inter’s home ground.\nAdvertisement\nJamaicans and Americans alike, though, would both be faced with the same problem: Messi might not play. Inter Miami head coach Javier Mascherano has suggested that the Argentine’s recent string of absences isn’t injury-related, that the club is simply managing his workload in the middle of a busy run of games. Inter has league matches, Concacaf matches and also FIFA Club World Cup matches to contend with and they are coming off a hectic preseason that included a multi-continent tour.\nThat matters little to the fans who turn up to see him play. In Houston earlier this month, the Dynamo felt compelled to offer fans free tickets to future matches after Messi didn’t travel. Fans in Fort Lauderdale the following week watched as Messi was excluded from the matchday squad for Inter’s first-leg match against Cavalier. Others have missed out as well: in 2023, over 70,000 fans turned up in Atlanta, only to find out that Messi was back home in Florida taking a rest.\n“It’s not a matter of disappointment for me,” MLS commissioner Don Garber told The Athletic after that match. “I think that fans in time will have to decide what games they’re going to go to and what to put on their calendar. The player could’ve had an injury that he suffered earlier in the season and not been able to play. The player being held out for rest is something that I as the commissioner of the league, if that’s in his best interest from a health and safety perspective, I’m going to support it.”\nJamaicans have taken a pretty calm approach to Messi’s visit, something in line with the vibe of the entire island. There was no screeching mob at the airport on Wednesday night, just a handful of curious onlookers and a pack of stray dogs in the parking lot. There was no crowd outside the club’s hotel in downtown Kingston either, as there almost always is on these trips abroad.\nJamaica’s Minister of Culture, Gender, Entertainment, and Sport, Olivia “Babsy” Grange, extended a warm welcome to football legend Lionel Messi as he arrived in the country with his Inter Miami teammates.

He doesn’t think that Cavalier has much of a chance to overturn Miami’s 2-0 advantage heading into the return leg, but that doesn’t matter to him either.\n“As long as we see him!” Campbell says with a laugh. “We just want to see him play.”\n(Top photo: Megan Briggs/Getty Images)",
