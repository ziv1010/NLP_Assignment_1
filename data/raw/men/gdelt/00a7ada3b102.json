The forward has scored 234 goals and given 105 assists in 381 matches for the Reds and has also won the Premier League and the Champions League with the Merseyside club.\nHowever, there is a distinct possibility that this will be Salah’s final season at Liverpool. The 32-year-old is out of contract at the Premier League leaders at the end of the season, and no new deal is in place at the moment.\nJournalist Ben Jacobs has shared the information he has received from sources in Saudi Arabia about a potential move for Salah.\nThe well-connected journalist has revealed that Al-Hilal plan to make a big push for the former Chelsea attacker in 2025.\nJacobs wrote on X: “Al-Hilal now free up significant budget due to Neymar’s termination. A big drive is expected to find a new marquee star in time for the Club World Cup.\n“Saudi Pro League set to take FIFA up on the exceptional window between 1-10 June in order to sign players ahead of the tournament.\n“Mo Salah is still Hilal’s number one target as Jorge Jesus wants a right-sided attacker. However, Saudi dealmakers also respectful of Salah’s negotiations with Liverpool and his decision-making process.\n“SPL sporting director Michael Emenalo has a strong relationship with Salah and the financials on offer already outlined from the approach on behalf of Al-Ittihad in 2023.\n“If given any encouragement to bid, Saudi will make Salah a new offer that will see him become the best-paid player in the league. SPL executives feel Salah arriving will boost the TV revenue when the next cycle is sold this summer. And there is an idea to sell Egypt-specifc rights rather than a MENA wide package.”\nREAD MORE 🔴 Five reasons for Trent Alexander-Arnold to stay at Liverpool vs five reasons to leave for Real Madrid\nLiverpool stance on Mo Salah revealed\nJacobs has also shared what Liverpool believe about the current situation of Salah.\nThe Reds are still confident that the forward will sign a new contract with the club and extend his stay at Anfield.\nLiverpool did not anticipate talks with Salah over a new contract would finish quickly, so they are not surprised that even in January a deal has not been struck.\nJacobs added on X: “#LFC are still optimistic Salah will instead extend even though parties are yet to reach an agreement. Late last year, the feeling within Liverpool was Salah talks would take some time, so no surprise January hasn’t yet brought clarity.\n“No doubt Al-Hilal will push for another star, whether Salah or another big name, ahead of the Club World Cup.”\nLatest Liverpool news: Alexander-Arnold hope, Nunez exit\nJust like Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold is also out of contract at Liverpool at the end of the season.\nTalks between Liverpool and Alexander-Arnold over a new deal are going on, with the Reds determined to keep him at Anfield for the long term.\nReal Madrid are keen on taking the right-back to the Santiago Bernabeu in the January transfer window or in the summer of 2025.\nHowever, there is now speculation that Los Blancos are in contact with Joshua Kimmich of Bayern Munich as they are annoyed that Alexander-Arnold is not pushing for a move away from Liverpool in the January transfer window.\nMeanwhile, Liverpool have been linked with Borussia Dortmund forward Karim Adeyemi.\nNapoli are interested in a deal for Adeyemi as an alternative to Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho, but now Liverpool are reportedly showing interest in him.\nThe Italian club are also looking at a potential deal for a Liverpool player.
