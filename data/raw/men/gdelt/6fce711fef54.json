Right now, he’s not ready for many minutes. He’s coming off a serious injury that lasted more than a year. He’s not at 100 percent. He’s not at the physical level he was before the injury. The Federation should be careful and take care of him.”\nThe fact Spain would call up a player who is not 100 percent and has played less than 30 minutes of football in over a year is pure insanity, but it’s also the kind of thing we’ve come to expect from the RFEF.\nAll we can do now is hope nothing happens to Bernal and that he doesn’t play a second more than he needs to.",
