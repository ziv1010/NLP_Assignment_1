Indeed, it seemed Jack Butland – a replacement for Martin Dubravka – and Wout Weghorst – who provides short-term cover for Cristiano Ronaldo – would be the only additions.\nHowever, an injury sustained by Christian Eriksen late in the month has ruled out the Dane until late April. And with United short of options, the club allowed Ten Hag to secure the late addition of Marcel Sabizter just before the window closed.\nThe Austrian star arrives on loan from Bayern Munich and appears ready to give his all. However, his arrival at Old Trafford has already has already seen Rio Ferdinand at loggerheads over the deal with Paul Merson.\nNonetheless, Ten Hag will hope his squad is well equipped to continue their push towards four goals. Indeed, as it stands, they are currently the only Premier League side left fighting on four fronts. As such, the United manager will need as many options as possible.\nTheir main, that said, is surely on securing a top-four finish and with it a return to Champions League football.\nThat would also seriously impact on Ten Hag’s summer spending. And Wednesday’s Euro Paper Talk suggests a deal for a big-name Barcelona attacker is a genuine possibility.\nIndeed, a host of names are seemingly on their radar from Harry Kane, Victor Osimhen and Goncalo Ramos.\nREAD MORE: Man Utd feature in January transfer window winners\nMan Utd to make Dusan Vlahovic top summer target\nHowever, Italian journalist Rudy Galetti has other ideas. And he is adamant that United are gearing up for a big-money assault to sign another striker instead.\nAnd he insists the man at the centre of their attention is Juventus frontman Dusan Vlahovic.\nHe claims Ten Hag has instructed his scouts to pay ‘extreme attention’ to his performances over the next few months. And with Juventus suffering a 15-point penalty for transfer irregularities, some big-name departures look likely to leave.\nThe word in Italy is that Vlahovic, a January 2022 capture from Fiorentina, will be the big name to depart.\nThat is a view shared by Galetti, who claims ‘first confirmations’ about a summer sale have been made known to him.\nAnd he reveals that Juventus are making it clear that the 6ft 3in Serbian will be on the market for a starting price of £70.1m (€80m).\nThat will certainly fall within United’s summer budget, with Vlahovic likely to cost less than Kane and Osimhen.\nIndeed, the 23-year-old has the characteristics that Ten Hag likes, who favours the option of a big-man in attack. That was an approach he used to good affect at Ajax with Sebastien Haller. And it’s a formula he has repeated at United too with Weghorst arriving on a short-term deal.\nPer Galetti, Vlahovic is the main striker that Ten Hag has set his sights on this summer. And he reportedly feels he can take his game on to another level by securing his signing this summer.\nThe frontman has a record of 68 goals in 172 career appearances – around a goal every 2.5 games.\nREAD MORE: Two reasons cited after Man Utd failed to sign Liverpool target Ten Hag wanted over Sabitzer",
