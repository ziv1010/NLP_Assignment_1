I think they’re too canny and too wise to fall into this trap.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘It’s one thing having a player on loan, playing a small percent of his wages so it’s a small transaction. You have him for four months, it costs you £5-6million, nothing, nobody cares.\n‘Everybody knew Marcus Rashford was going to lift a leg at Villa. I think the system helps as well.\n‘I just think Villa are too wise for it and first of all, they’re not going to want to pay over £300,000 a week and a transfer fee. It’s too big of a deal.’\nWhile Villa’s desire to keep Rashford is unknown, the England international has been urged not to return to Manchester United.\n‘Marcus is having a good time at Aston Villa,’ former Premier League star Emmanuel Petit told PokerFirma. ‘Step by step, he has to return to his best level.\n‘For the last two, three years, I think he disappeared from the radar, so the most important thing for him is to get back to his best level by paying regular football.\n‘He made the move in January and was back in the England squad. It looks like he made the right decision for his own career in terms of leaving United.\n‘Should he go back to Manchester United in the summer? I don’t think so.\n‘Rashford needs to concentrate on getting his fitness and his game back. That’s his number one priority between now and the summer.\n‘He shouldn’t be thinking about where he will be playing next season. But at Manchester United, he disappeared for a couple of years.\n‘The most important thing for him is to come back to the right level. And then after that, maybe he can think about something else, but put those thoughts on ice right now.’\nAmorim was asked about Rashford’s upturn in form at Aston Villa at his pre-match press conference on Monday afternoon.\n‘We have a lot of games to play and I am focused on my team and my players and Marcus is not my player at the moment,’ he said.\n‘But every player that performs well on loan is good news for my club so I am happy with that.’\nMore Trending\nRashford, meanwhile, said it was a ‘great feeling’ to register his first goals since December 1 in the FA Cup quarter-final victory over Preston and insisted he was ‘enjoying his football’ at the Midlands club.\n‘It’s a great feeling,’ he told BBC Sport. ‘It’s always nice for a forward to get a goal, so hopefully it continues.\n‘I feel like I’ve been getting fitter and playing better football since I’ve been here. I missed a lot of football before joining up with them. My body feels good and I’m enjoying my football for now.’\nRashford could be set for an exciting end to the season at Villa as Emery’s side prepare for a FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace and Champions League quarter-final against PSG.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Trent Alexander-Arnold, Alisson Becker and Conor Bradley injury updates from Arne Slot\nMORE: ‘Trust me’ – Nani tells Man Utd to sign £58m Arsenal transfer target\nMORE: Darren Bent names the ‘first’ player Arsenal will sell this summer",
