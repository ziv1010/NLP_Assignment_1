The youngster made his way up to the first team, then managed by the legendary former midfielder Zinedine Zidane, and was part of the star-studded squad that won the second of three Champions League titles in a row in 2016-17.\nAdvertisement\nAfter a brief but successful spell at French side Lyon, Mariano was re-signed for a €30million ($35m; £26m at current exchange rates) buy-back clause in 2018 and inherited Madrid’s iconic No 7 shirt from his idol Cristiano Ronaldo, who had recently moved to Juventus.\nMariano’s time at the Bernabeu reached its peak when he scored a stoppage-time goal against Barcelona that secured a 2-0 win in El Clasico in March 2020 — the final game in Spain before the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown.\nBut since then, things have been tough for the Spanish-born Dominican Republic international.\nInjuries and coaching changes meant he was relegated to a secondary role at Madrid until his exit in 2023. He went on to join Sevilla, but was again hampered by injuries and left last year. He then spent 304 days without playing an official match as he searched for a new team — and 1,135 without scoring a goal, before he netted in his first game back for the Dominican Republic against Puerto Rico in March.\nNow the 32-year-old finally has a club side again — La Liga’s Alaves, who he signed with until 2027 this summer — and is starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.\nThe Athletic spoke to him exclusively about the pressures of playing for Madrid, what made that side coached by Zidane so special, how he kept hope during his time away from the game and what advice he would give stars who find themselves in his position in the Spanish capital.\nMariano was born just 30 kilometres from the Camp Nou in the Catalan town of Premia de Mar to a Spanish father and a Dominican mother. But the young striker went virtually unnoticed by Barcelona’s major youth academies until a Real Madrid scout judged he was a natural goalscorer.\nHe moved to Madrid in 2011, impressing for their ‘C’ and ‘B’ teams and catching the eye of Zidane, who promoted him to the senior side for the 2016-17 season. In the club’s most successful campaign for 59 years, they won a La Liga and Champions League double with the potent attacking trio of Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale and Ronaldo (nicknamed the ‘BBC’).\nAdvertisement\nMariano scored five goals in the 14 appearances he was limited to that campaign, but the impact that front three made on him is clear.\n“That year was incredible. We felt like we were going to win every Champions League game,” Mariano tells The Athletic from Alaves’ training base in the Basque city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, about 53 kilometres south of Bilbao. “We played very, very attractive football. Cristiano was in attack, everyone was at their best.\n“I learned a lot from Cristiano. About routines, arriving early for training, treatment, how to train, how to recover, how to prepare for a match — everything. About keeping your word, about leadership.\n“It was one of the best teams I’ve ever played for because it wasn’t just the starters, but also what the press called ‘Plan B’ (the substitutes such as Mariano who were key in many games). It was a bit curious, but the truth is that Plan B was like Plan A.\n“Until a team won in training, matches were not over. Sometimes they would go into extra time, and then a golden goal would be scored. Comebacks were something we trained for and it felt like Madrid always won in the end.”\nAt the end of that season, Mariano moved to Lyon for €8m in search of more gametime, signing a five-year deal. He scored 21 goals in his first season in French football, with his 18 efforts in Ligue 1 only bettered by four other players.\nThe parallels with Endrick, the 19-year-old Brazilian forward who has played just 11 minutes for Madrid this season — and who could be on his way to Lyon on loan in January — are clear.\n“If Endrick ends up leaving, or a player who isn’t getting much playing time has to go abroad to play, I would tell him to enjoy it a lot, to appreciate that if he’s going to be a starter on the team, that’s the best thing that can happen to him,” says Mariano.\nAdvertisement\n“You have to try to prove yourself when they give you that confidence, because it’s not the same when you play a few minutes every three games. You can’t prove your worth in a few minutes. But if they trust you and you’re a starter, that’s when you can prove a lot of things. In this case, if he (Endrick) leaves, he could also return to Madrid.”\nThat is exactly what happened with Mariano after Ronaldo’s surprise move to Juventus in the summer of 2018. With Mariano close to joining Sevilla, Madrid activated their €30m buy-back clause for the then 25-year-old.\n“As it was Madrid, I wasn’t going to say no,” Mariano says. “But they told me that this time it would be different (compared to his first spell, when he played a secondary role), and that was one of the reasons I wanted to return.”\nHe chose the No 7 shirt left by Ronaldo and was backed by new coach Julen Lopetegui. He scored a memorable Champions League goal against Roma in September 2018 and things were looking up for the Spanish-Dominican.\n“The No 7 may be the most important number ever worn by a Madrid player, because it has been worn by players such as Raul, Cristiano and many legends of the team,” he says. “So taking on that number was very nice, but at the same time it put a lot of pressure on me. I wasn’t taking Cristiano’s place, but it was still an important role.”\nPoor results meant Lopetegui was sacked and replaced by Santiago Solari in November 2018, before Zidane replaced Solari in March 2019. Madrid finished third in La Liga and did not win a major trophy, while the coaching changes along with muscle and back injuries affected Mariano. The Spanish press and fans began to criticise him for his repeated absences through injury.\n“Benzema was playing at a very high level and they decided to use him as the main striker,” Mariano explains. “I was there to cover for him when he wasn’t at his best. There was nothing I could do about it, I tried to take advantage when he wasn’t at his best.\nAdvertisement\n“I don’t know if there are people who have read misleading news stories in the press and have a different image of me. But Mariano is a hard worker and a football professional. That’s what he is, he lives and breathes it. And that’s the image I want to leave behind.”\nDespite scoring that Clasico goal in the 2019-20 La Liga-winning season, Mariano never returned to the form he showed at Lyon. He scored just six goals across five seasons in his second spell with Madrid.\nHe left as a free agent in the summer of 2023 and joined Sevilla later that year, but foot and knee injuries once again held him back. In June 2024, the club’s then sporting director Victor Orta explained how Mariano had tearfully apologised for not being able to return to top form despite his best efforts.\nHis time at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan also saw him reacquainted with former Madrid captain Sergio Ramos, who returned to his boyhood Andalusian club from 2023-2024.\n“Apart from being a leader wherever he has been, something very nice that I take away with me is his friendship,” says Mariano. “When you think of a leader, a captain, you think of Ramos. Even though it was a new team for him after many years, he still looked like the captain on many occasions.”\nIn March, Mariano was called up to the Dominican Republic national team for the first time in 11 years. That came despite the striker being without a team and training alone every day for the entire 2024-25 season. He worked alongside a fitness coach who adapted his workload to simulate the peaks that footballers experience when playing a real match.\nDiaz scored 20 minutes into that friendly in March against Puerto Rico, his first effort since netting for Madrid against Cadiz in February 2022.\n“My mother is very happy and I feel a lot of affection from the people there,” he says. “They make me laugh because they call me ‘the GOAT’. I think I’m the Dominican footballer who has gone the furthest and I’m very proud of that.”\nAdvertisement\nThe hard work he did alone has paid off. After a few days’ trial with Alaves this summer, he signed a contract with them until 2027. He is not a starter but scored a hat-trick against lower-league Getxo in an October Copa del Rey tie — his first club goals since that Cadiz game three-and-a-half years previously.\nDressing-room and club sources at Alaves, who asked to remain anonymous to protect relationships, praise him for always having a smile on his face, while they are helping him regain some of his sharpness in front of goal.\n“You have to work hard mentally because you don’t know when the next one (goal) will be, if there will be one,” Mariano says. “You always have to think positively and work with the idea that it will be as soon as possible. If you’re not prepared, you can get down, and I’m not interested in that.\n“Retirement never crossed my mind. I think that even when I retire, I’ll continue playing football. I hope for many years to come (I will be playing). I really like the United States (in the future). I’ve been there several times and I’d like to try MLS.\n“My family is very happy. After seeing me work alone for a year, now it’s not the same. Now they see me with a team on television, they see me enjoying playing, enjoying the goals.”\nMariano knows from experience how difficult it is to make a name for yourself at Real Madrid. Alaves face his old side on December 14 — with new coach Xabi Alonso experiencing some dressing-room friction so far, including after replacing Vinicius Junior in El Clasico earlier this season.\n“In football we all want to be protagonists, to give our all,” Mariano says. “When that situation arises (of not playing as much), maybe there are some players who perform well thanks to the motivation and others who are perhaps more bothered by it. That can happen, but it’s a question that the coach has to resolve, who has to see who is in the best shape.\n“Real Madrid is the biggest club in the world, but not everyone can be there. It’s true that there is life beyond that.”",
