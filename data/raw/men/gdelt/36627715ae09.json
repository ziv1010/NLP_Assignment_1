They barely touched the ball for 20 mins, but one flash of brilliance and they're suddenly on top.\nWas it just some kind of sick dream, or was Carlo once manager of Everton FC?\nDale Self\n3 Posted 03/10/2023 at 21:17:32\n3 Posted 03/10/2023 at 21:17:32\nNapoli are heating it up here. Kvartawhatever is cookin'.\nWe should have gone for Rudi Garcoa when we got Frank. It might have ended as a trainwreck but that would have been better than the damp squib we got.\nDale Self\n4 Posted 03/10/2023 at 21:37:52\n4 Posted 03/10/2023 at 21:37:52\nThat was an Exocet missile!\nDave Abrahams\n5 Posted 03/10/2023 at 21:41:06\n5 Posted 03/10/2023 at 21:41:06\nThat's an even better third goal by Real Madrid but was it an own goal, coming back off the bar and hitting the goalie, or did it hit the net first then hit the goalie?\nRob Halligan\n6 Posted 03/10/2023 at 22:07:38\n6 Posted 03/10/2023 at 22:07:38\nSeems a few posts on the Napoli v Real Madrid game, but did anyone watch Man Utd v Galatasaray?\nPickford can take a bit of stick from Everton fans but, believe me, I'd rather him than that clown in goal for Man Utd. A terrible pass out of his own area straight to a Galatasaray player, who was then brought down by Casemiro for a penalty.\nCasemiro red-carded for two yellows. Penalty was put wide, but the player who missed scored a few minutes later with a delicate chip over Onana, who went down far too early.\nOnana seems to have a mistake in him every game. £44M for him. Inter Milan must be laughing all the way to the bank. Man Utd now bottom on zero points.\nDale Self\n7 Posted 03/10/2023 at 22:32:17\n7 Posted 03/10/2023 at 22:32:17\nDave, it definitely deflected off a Napoli defender. I think the keeper got a hand to it but it was so strong it went in off the underside of the bar.\nI only saw the one replay so maybe there was a bounce off the keeper. Decent game but that Napoli back line let them down aside from the opening goal.\nPaul Morrison\n8 Posted 03/10/2023 at 23:30:42\n8 Posted 03/10/2023 at 23:30:42\nDale,\nI was sunk in the Falklands by an Exocet Missile, certain terms still get me twitched...\nPaul Ferry\n9 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:15:10\n9 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:15:10\nWe can only hope that the skunks get turned over tonight and that their fat thick feckers in the tight-fitting replicas in the stands are waving their scarves in the air singing 'Till I die' after a lesson from PSG as their tears stream down over their man-boobs into the ski-jump humungous gut and the drop into. their plumbers crack sweat filled wrinkly jeans.\nRob Halligan\n10 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:20:01\n10 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:20:01\nPaul, it was said earlier on SSN that many young Newcastle fans have never seen Newcastle play in Europe.\nI'd counter that, by saying there are many OLD Newcastle fans who have never seen Newcastle win a trophy!\nPaul Ferry\n11 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:26:49\n11 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:26:49\nAye, Rob, bonny lad, would that have been the old Fairs Cup like in 1970 or 1971?\nBut remember Rob, the BBC and everyone else are building things up for the Geordie party when in their minds they win a trophy, and it will be the greatest footy party ever coz they are such. diehards, didn't yer know\nDanny Oâ€™Neill\n12 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:27:05\n12 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:27:05\nIt get's worse. If it was bad enough listening to the latest episode of replay-gate, now they're on the one show being touted as the greenest club in English football, growing flowers and Maura making apple crumble with apples grown in the allotment at their Kirkby (yes Kirkby) training ground. That said, ours is in Halewood.\nI feel sick. I can see a long build up to the Derby but lets get Bournemouth out of the way first before I start all of my superstitious rituals before we make the journey to our former home.\nBarry Hesketh\n13 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:29:24\n13 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:29:24\nThink it was 1969 when Newcastle lifted the Fairs Cup Paul.\nEverton finished 5th in 1968 but lost the European place due to that nonsensical one city one club rule and also missed out due to losing the FA Cup final to WBA. Newcastle ended that campaign in tenth place to qualify for the Fairs Cup.\nRob Halligan\n14 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:31:18\n14 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:31:18\nWhey Aye man, but yee canna dispute that the fairs cup was a bonny cup to win, mind!!\nPaul Ferry\n15 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:33:27\n15 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:33:27\nCheers Barry, I remember John Tudor from footy cards, Wyn Davies was it? Bobby Moncur. Ian McFaul, between the sticks, I think. Running out of names now. Wasn't there a winger, Barraclough or something, or did he come later.\nBarry Hesketh\n16 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:37:35\n16 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:37:35\nJoe Harvey was the manager of Newcastle from 1962 until Gordon Lee took the job in 1975. Barraclough I seem to remember as a player, not sure he managed them but if he did it would have been much later.\nPaul Ferry\n17 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:39:05\n17 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:39:05\n'kin hell Rob, you're fluent lad, could it possibly be that you were born at blaydon me laddie\nRob Halligan\n18 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:39:37\n18 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:39:37\nWasn't Malcolm Macdonald around at that time?\nPaul Ferry\n19 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:39:46\n19 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:39:46\nOf course, Lee came fom them\nPaul Ferry\n20 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:40:23\n20 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:40:23\nNow you're tookin took royalty.\nBarry Hesketh\n21 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:42:10\n21 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:42:10\nJust looking at the side that stopped Everton from scoring in a goalless draw at Goodison in January 1970.\nW McFaul, D Craig, Frank Clark, T Gibb, J McNamee, Bobby Moncur, B Robson (is that pop Robson?, J Smith Wyn Davies, R Guthrie (Sunderland player in 73 Cup Final?, D Ford.\nW McFaul, D Craig, Frank Clark, T Gibb, J McNamee, Bobby Moncur, B Robson (is that pop Robson?, J Smith Wyn Davies, R Guthrie (Sunderland player in 73 Cup Final?, D Ford.\nPaul Ferry\n22 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:43:09\n22 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:43:09\nWhey aye man, here's the bonny laddies who give it ta Ujpesti Dozsa Willie McFaul; David Craig, Frank Clark, Tommy Gibb, Ollie Burton, Bobby Moncur, Jim Scott (Alan Foggon 73), Preben Arentoft, Pop Robson, Wyn Davies, Jackie Sinclair.\nBarry Hesketh\n23 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:44:28\n23 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:44:28\nPaul.\nAlan 'Foggon' the Tyne?\nRob Halligan\n24 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:44:48\n24 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:44:48\nNo Malcolm Macdonald then??\nPaul Ferry\n25 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:45:06\n25 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:45:06\nI recognise 4 of them - bonny Frank Clark,\nPaul Ferry\n26 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:46:07\n26 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:46:07\n1971-76 Rob\nKieran Kinsella\n27 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:46:08\n27 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:46:08\nParis St. Germain didn't even exist when Newcastle last won a trophy. They were founded in 1970.\nSince then PSG have won 46 major trophies to Newcastle's 0.\nPaul Ferry\n28 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:47:57\n28 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:47:57\nThey finished 10th to get into the Inter Cities Fairs Cup\nPaul Ferry\n29 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:48:49\n29 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:48:49\nMajor trophy! Friendly games were regularly held between teams from cities holding trade fairs and it was from these games that the competition evolved. The competition was initially only open to teams from cities that hosted trade fairs and where these teams finished in their national league had no relevance.\nRob Halligan\n30 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:56:36\n30 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:56:36\nThe last major trophy of note they won, was the FA Cup in 1955. 68 years ago.\nBarry Hesketh\n31 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:57:49\n31 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:57:49\nManchester United (2nd) qualified for the European Cup as the 1967â€“68 European Cup winners. Alongside champions Manchester City.\nEverton (5th) were ineligible to participate in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup as Liverpool(3rd) had already qualified. Under the rules of the cup, only one team per city could participate. Chelsea (6th) took their place as the highest-ranked team that hadn't already qualified for a European competition.\nWest Bromwich Albion (8th) qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup as the 1967-68 FA Cup winners.\nArsenal (9th) and Tottenham Hotspur (7th) were ineligible to participate in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup as Chelsea had already qualified. Under the rules of the cup, only one team per city could participate.\nNewcastle United (10th) took their place as the highest-ranked team that hadn't already qualified for a European competition.\nDave Abrahams\n32 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:59:33\n32 Posted 04/10/2023 at 19:59:33\nBrian,\nThe truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\nThey control the media as well to get their views highlighted.\nPaul Ferry\n33 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:00:21\n33 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:00:21\nYa were a wee bairn in ya nappy like Rob.\nRob Halligan\n34 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:03:22\n34 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:03:22\nI was a mere twinkle in me grandparents eyes, Paul. Quite a few years before I arrived on this planet!\nKieran Kinsella\n35 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:03:37\n35 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:03:37\nRob,\nGoing with 1955 then, a woman named Martha Graham in the US died four years after Newcastle last won a major trophy was actually born in 1844.\nMeaning she could have gone to the Great Exhibition of 1851 and met Queen Victoria and also watched Newcastle United win their most recent trophy.\nAndy Crooks\n36 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:05:31\n36 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:05:31\nPaul, that was a good team. David Craig played for Northern Ireland. I think Iam McFaul got a few caps but was understudy to the mighty Pat Jennings. He went to Newcastle from Linfield for £10,000 which was a king's ransom for and Irish league team.\nBobby Moncur looked like my dad and Joe Harvey looked likey granddad. Actually, in those days managers all looked old and wouldn't have been seen dead in a track suit.\nStan Cullis\nTony Waddington\nJoe Harvey\nJoe Mercer\nBob Stokoe\nBill Nicholson.\nMatt Busby\nAh, the good old days, of inside-rights and inside-lefts, right-halves and left-halves and skinny malnourished wingers.\nPaul Ferry\n37 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:05:38\n37 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:05:38\nAye man Rob ya wer no canny bairn warn Toon won cup like man!\nPaul Ferry\n38 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:06:15\n38 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:06:15\nI got Man City on TNT and Rotherham on Sky, are the Skunks not on the box?\nBarry Hesketh\n39 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:06:38\n39 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:06:38\nSeeing as our current manager is a mini version of Big Sam, should we be chanting Dyche, Dyche, Gravy to the Vanilla Ice tune, at Goodison on Saturday?\nPaul Ferry\n40 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:09:04\n40 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:09:04\nWith chairman in sheepskins, Andy, and big cigars.\nRob Halligan\n41 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:12:09\n41 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:12:09\nSkunks are on TNT 2.\nPaul Smith\n42 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:15:33\n42 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:15:33\nGordon starting in the Champions League against PSG. Looking like a good move for him. Tbh it smarts.\nPaul Ferry\n43 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:16:10\n43 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:16:10\nCheers, Rob, I'll see if I can get that.\nPaul Ferry\n44 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:18:35\n44 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:18:35\nIf anyone else wants to watch skunks in 'merica - https://crichdplayer.com/tnt-sports-2-live-stream-uk\nKieran Kinsella\n47 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:24:14\n47 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:24:14\nRemember when Rafa was here and we were linked with a move for Trippier? Then he apparently wanted to sign Longstaff on a free. Everyone was up in arms we needed better players as we were relying on the likes of Anthony Gordon.\nBarry Hesketh\n48 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:30:29\n48 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:30:29\nFoden scores for Man City, why Southgate won't play him in the middle for England is a mystery to me.\nAndy Crooks\n49 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:31:43\n49 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:31:43\nLampard to Rangers???\nRob Halligan\n50 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:36:05\n50 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:36:05\nKieran, I don't think it was the Longstaff who's playing tonight, Sean, I think it was his brother Matty Longstaff. Could be wrong though.\nAnthony A Hughes\n51 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:36:13\n51 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:36:13\nSouthgate plays with the handbrake on with his style of football, Barry.\nPaul Ferry\n52 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:36:40\n52 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:36:40\nSaw that, Andy, apparently he's dead keen on the job.\nPaul Hewitt\n53 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:36:44\n53 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:36:44\nWatching Celtic. Their Japanese players never ever stop running. Wish our players had half their energy.\nPaul Ferry\n54 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:37:23\n54 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:37:23\nIt was Sean Rob\nPaul Ferry\n55 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:38:08\n55 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:38:08\nFinally watching some good footy PH\nPaul Hewitt\n56 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:41:57\n56 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:41:57\nTo be fair, PF Celtic are playing decent. Rodgers is a good manager.\nPaul Ferry\n57 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:44:03\n57 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:44:03\nWhat a fecking save or was it over, offside wasn't it anyway?\nPaul Ferry\n58 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:44:25\n58 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:44:25\nAgree PH\nRob Halligan\n59 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:44:38\n59 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:44:38\nFFS 2-0.

Fecking skunks or was he played on?\nDanny Oâ€™Neill\n63 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:53:39\n63 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:53:39\nI thought offside to start with, but onside when the ball payed over.\nReminded me of the position Dele Alli took up for Richarlison's goal against Palace. Dropped deep late and after the ball was played.\nGreat finish for their first.\nRob Halligan\n64 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:53:47\n64 Posted 04/10/2023 at 20:53:47\nGuimaraes punches a PSG player on the head, and only gets a yellow. At least it looked like a punch.\nPaul Ferry\n65 Posted 04/10/2023 at 21:00:24\n65 Posted 04/10/2023 at 21:00:24\nWhae aye, man, Rob ya jessie like that we nah punch fra Shearer Bruno like it wer a lassie slap Rob wat yer talkin like man.\nDanny Oâ€™Neill\n66 Posted 04/10/2023 at 21:06:38\n66 Posted 04/10/2023 at 21:06:38\nThat lot get a free pass at the weekend Rob. I'm convinced. Klopp will be fitted with a headset with direct comms to Stockley Park to advise them.\nWatching PSG, who aside from the Intertoto, I think they have only won the cup winners cup like us in Europe.\nThey may have had great players in recent times, but it shows what playing in Europe's 5th league does. Or the \"Farmer's League\" as I bait my French friends with.\nToo easy for them and qualify every year with little effort.

Referee sent to the pitch side monitor for a handball by a Marseille player, he seemed to indicate “Penaltyâ€, only for Marseille to get a free kick.\nWeird, because Marseille had a corner at the time. Seems there was a foul by a Brighton defender in the build-up to the potential penalty. I give up with VARâ€¦ it's bloody useless.\nBarry Hesketh\n99 Posted 05/10/2023 at 18:19:48\n99 Posted 05/10/2023 at 18:19:48\nRob @260\nIt seems to protect only the chosen few clubs, I dislike this looking at the build-up to an incident rather than the incident in isolation. If somebody gets pushed on the half-way line and the official missed it, and somebody goes on to score a goal, a few moves later, it should be a given as a goal. How far back should they go?\nAnyway it's all good preparation for Brighton and their game on Sunday, they might find a few weird decisions being made.\nRob Halligan\n100 Posted 05/10/2023 at 18:22:50\n100 Posted 05/10/2023 at 18:22:50\nBarry, don't forget there are an extra 14K seats at BMD.
