It is very exciting for all involved that the response shows so many clubs share our vision and passion to develop professional football across Oceania,\" he said.\nWith eight premier teams from across the Pacific, the league promises to set new benchmarks for performance, competition, and opportunity for the sport across Oceania.\nThe 24 expressions of interest include six (6) from New Zealand, four (4) each from Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Australia, two (2) from New Caledonia and one (1) each from Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tahiti and Vanuatu.\nThere was no interest from Tonga, the Cook Islands and American Samoa but there is possibility that clubs might be offering players from the three OFC members opportunities to also play for them in the league.\nThe processing timelines will see the conclusion of the club application process at the end of June, before the OFC Club Licensing Committee's recommendations to the OFC Executive Committee in August, with teams that cold be in the eight initial clubs.\nThe final approval and issuance of licenses to the eight selected clubs will be done by September, giving the clubs time to set up and secure their players.",
