  "body_text": "Frida Maanum has been named the Football Supporters' Association’s Women’s Player of the Year for 2023, after a breakout campaign in the Women's Super League.\nOur Norwegian midfielder recorded nine goals and four assists during her second season in the WSL, and her exquisite strike against Bayern Munich sent us through to our first UEFA Women's Champions League semi-final in ten years.\nMaanum was voted our Player of the Month twice last term and was included in the Professional Footballers' Association Team of the Year. This season, she is currently enjoying some lightning form, scoring three in her last three games.\nThe fan-voted accolade was unveiled at the FSA Awards on Monday evening and was awarded to our number 12 over the likes of Chelsea’s Lauren James, Manchester United's Mary Earps and Aston Villa’s Rachel Daly.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
