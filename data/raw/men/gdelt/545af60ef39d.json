  "body_text": "Manchester United have identified Dan Ashworth as their first-choice candidate to become sporting director as part of the overhaul of football operations led by incoming minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\nAshworth has informed Newcastle United of an approach by United but club-to-club contact is yet to be made formally. That is anticipated soon though and the process is expected to develop quickly. The 52-year-old is interested in the opportunity to be part of the new INEOS-led era.\nAdvertisement\nIf appointed, Ashworth will follow United’s incoming chief executive Omar Berrada in leaving a Premier League rival for Old Trafford.\nHere, The Athletic answers the key questions regarding Ashworth’s potential appointment…\nFollow the latest Manchester United news with The Athletic\n- Manchester United will make ‘fresh decision’ on Mason Greenwood\n- Dan Ashworth taking on ‘ultimate challenge’ if he joins Manchester United\n- Sir Jim Ratcliffe on Manchester United, Old Trafford, Sheikh Jassim and Mason Greenwood: Full transcript\nRemind me who Ashworth is…\nAshworth is one of the most highly-respected executives in the English game, having built a reputation for leading impressive football operations over more than a decade.\nAfter a playing career spent in non-League football, Ashworth worked his way up to the role of sporting and technical director at West Bromwich Albion in 2007.\nHis part in helping West Brom to two promotions and a top-half Premier League finish caught the attention of the English Football Association, where he was the brainchild of the ‘England DNA’ programme, implementing a defined style of play across all teams.\nAshworth resigned from the FA shortly after the 2018 World Cup — following England’s best major tournament finish in 22 years — and joined Brighton & Hove Albion as technical director.\nHis two and a half years at the Amex Stadium saw Brighton fully establish themselves as a top-flight club and one of the best-run clubs in the Premier League, which alerted the Saudi Arabia-backed consortium that owns Newcastle.\nAshworth was forced to serve a period of gardening leave before starting work at St James’ Park in June 2022. Around £160million ($200m) in transfer spending produced Newcastle’s highest league finish in 20 years last season, as well as a return to the Champions League.\nWhy are we talking about this now?\nRatcliffe’s 25 per cent investment is yet to be completed but he and his INEOS team — led by Sir Dave Brailsford — have been busy laying the foundations for their planned restructuring of United’s football department.\nAdvertisement\nThe shock appointment of Berrada as the next chief executive from rivals Manchester City was confirmed last month following a process that involved the Glazer family, United’s majority owners.\nThe appointment of a sporting director — a more football-specific position — is expected to follow and has been led by INEOS. Ashworth’s name has been widely linked since the autumn but he is not the only candidate that Ratcliffe and Brailsford have considered, especially as a recruitment specialist is on the agenda.\nJulian Ward has featured prominently in discussions. Ward took over from Michael Edwards as Liverpool’s sporting director in June 2022, having assisted for 18 months prior, but stepped down amid a shifting hierarchy above.\nWard is said to be careful about his next choice, with importance placed on the scope of the role. Talks have taken place but the sense is that he is unlikely to join United, with the delineation of responsibilities for the job still unclear.\nPaul Mitchell’s name has been consistently linked too but, after departing Monaco last year, the 42-year-old is said to have made it clear to INEOS that he wished to pursue other opportunities.\nMitchell is said to have always planned to return to the UK and spend time with his family while pondering his next steps.\nAshworth’s reputation and pedigree always made him a leading candidate. He has the advantage of an existing relationship with Brailsford from their time working together at the English FA in 2016. The pair have retained a close relationship.\nMany in the industry share Brailsford’s opinion that Ashworth is an ideal fit, considering the scale of the task at Old Trafford, and there is a sense that he has always been tempted by the task of restoring the club to former glories.\nDespite that, Ashworth has kept his cards close to his chest since murmurs of INEOS’ interest began to emerge, even as they gathered momentum in December. As no formal contact occurred, he gave people at Newcastle the impression he would be staying. He argued he could not distance himself from an approach that had never been made and continued his work. At the start of January, Ashworth flew to Saudi Arabia to hold detailed talks about the winter window with Newcaste’s owners.\nBut in recent days, the picture has changed, with Brailsford revealing his full intentions.\nAdvertisement\nWhat role would he have at United?\nShould Ashworth agree to join United, he will become the club’s sporting director — the same role he has held at St James’ Park — and report to Berrada.\nThe INEOS plan has always been to get the top position sorted, then work down, so that the sporting director knows they are working under Berrada, rather than waiting to find out who the CEO will be after they have been hired.\nBrailsford has conducted his search, and Berrada has had input, even if there are some restrictions while he is on gardening leave from City.\nBrailsford has spoken internally about the need to shift the inertia that has plagued United for years and believes that making bold appointments quickly is one way to generate enthusiasm and momentum across the club.\nWhy is a sporting director important?\nThe role of a sporting director is loosely defined and varies widely from club to club, in responsibilities and job title — with many ‘technical directors’ and ‘directors of football’ fulfilling the same purpose.\nBut fortunately, Ashworth summed up how he sees his role in an interview with The Athletic in February 2020, while working at Brighton.\n“I always draw that I sit in the middle of the wheel and on the outside is the head of each department,” he said. “The job of the technical director is to just keep that wheel spinning by connecting all those spokes together and, when one of those heads of department leaves, recruit them.”\nMany would argue that this is the sort of role — including the public speaking — that United have lacked since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement in 2013 and even since a restructuring of Old Trafford’s football operations three years ago.\nIn early 2021, United announced a restructuring of Old Trafford’s football operations with John Murtough becoming the first football director and Darren Fletcher appointed technical director.\nAdvertisement\nAs football director, Murtough has led on transfer negotiations that have seen an outlay of approximately £585m since the start of the 2021-22 season but that investment in the playing squad has failed to produce consistent results on the pitch.\nMurtough was the leading figure behind the appointment of Erik ten Hag but, after securing Champions League qualification and winning the Carabao Cup during his first season in charge, results have been mixed and Ten Hag’s position has come under scrutiny.\nAs sporting director under INEOS, Ashworth would sit at the top of a restructured football department and assume many of the responsibilities Murtough has held in recent years — with other senior figures, including the manager, reporting to him.\nIs it easy to extract him from Newcastle?\nThis is the crucial question. The Athletic has been told there is a set compensation fee for Ashworth’s exit, which comes with an extended period where he cannot work for a rival club. Ashworth could simply resign, but that prompts gardening leave believed to last up to a year. United want Ashworth to start as soon as possible, before the summer window opens, so will negotiate with Newcastle to try to come to a compromise.\nAn earlier introduction at United will cost more money, which is the same situation as Newcastle had when taking Ashworth from Brighton. Ashworth resigned from Brighton in February 2022 and began work at St James’ Park four months later after the two clubs agreed a fee. Ashworth’s start date would have been later had there been no resolution.\nThe test now, almost exactly two years on, is the same. How much recompense does one Premier League club want to let an employee start work at another? This is not about an exit as Newcastle will not wish to keep Ashworth at the club if he wants to go.\nOne factor in the equation is that his period at Newcastle has not been entirely smooth behind the scenes, with moments of friction coming from Eddie Howe’s already-established authority, a blurring of responsibilities, plus managing the high expectations of owners in Saudi Arabia’s PIF, although Ashworth strengthened relations with chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan during the trip to Riyadh at the start of this year.\nAdvertisement\nINEOS are expected to argue that Newcastle should not price out Ashworth from a move when the situation is not perfect anyway, and it is better for them to receive a settlement that can assist on financial fair play regulations rather than keep paying him to do nothing during his gardening leave. But Newcastle may dig in, feeling that if Brailsford rates Ashworth so highly United should to pay for him. Sources describe the potential asking price as “very high”.\nManchester United are prepared to wait — beyond summer if necessary — but there is a openness on both sides to find an agreement, which could arrive in the coming days.\nIs Ashworth any good at transfers?\nWhile it would be wrong to characterise Ashworth’s work in his most recent roles as solely based on transfers, his record of overseeing and managing recruitment departments will be of most interest to United supporters.\nAt Brighton, Ashworth recognised that the club’s stature and resources relative to top Premier League clubs meant a focus on younger players from less fashionable and more obscure leagues was needed.\nAlthough this was a continuation of a pre-existing policy and done in conjunction with the recruitment department, there were notable transfer successes, including Kaoru Mitoma, Leandro Trossard and Marc Cucurella.\nArguably the most impressive deal struck during Ashworth’s time at Brighton was for Moises Caicedo, who was signed from Ecuadorian club Independiente for less than £4.5m in early 2021.\nCaicedo was then sold to Chelsea last year in a deal that could potentially rise to a British club record of £115m, while Trossard and Cucurella left Brighton last season for a combined fee that may reach £90m.\nAll three sales came after Ashworth’s departure but demonstrate an ability to strike deals for under-appreciated talent with a high resale value, something that United have struggled to do.\nAdvertisement\nAshworth paid great attention to Brighton’s youth pathways and development loans for academy players, with the likes of Ben White and Robert Sanchez becoming first-team regulars before commanding £75m in transfer fees.\nEvan Ferguson, the highly-rated young centre-forward, was brought to the club’s academy during Ashworth’s tenure.\nAt Newcastle, the 52-year-old has operated in two summer transfer windows with greater resources than he could enjoy at Brighton. Having told staff at the club it would take three summers to reshape the squad, it is arguably still early to judge his record.\nIt is fair to question the wisdom of signing Sandro Tonali, who is serving a 10-month ban from the Italian Football Federation for breaches of betting rules which predated his arrival at St James’ Park in a £55m deal from AC Milan last summer.\nOther signings since Ashworth’s appointment — such as Alexander Isak, Anthony Gordon and Sven Botman — have proved more successful, although head of recruitment Steve Nickson and head of first-team technical scouting Andy Howe, Eddie’s nephew, play key roles.\nWhat does this mean for John Murtough?\nMurtough’s position as football director has been under scrutiny since Ratcliffe secured his deal with the Glazers. He and Brailsford came in with clear intentions to shake up the dynamic and given Murtough’s influential position for the past 10 years, the spotlight fell his way. Murtough acknowledged to colleagues his days might be numbered.\nBut he felt he could provide value to the incoming powers in other ways than his role, such as his understanding of mechanisms at Carrington. He has been open to accepting a reduction of responsibilities.\nHowever, the more Brailsford has got to grips with United, the greater the expectation grows from within the club that Murtough will end up departing.\nAdvertisement\nThere is an irony in this turn of events, given Murtough’s presence was a factor in Ashworth declining to enter into proper talks with United when sounded out at the start of 2022. Ashworth had been recommended by Ferguson to chief executive Richard Arnold, who made the call. Ashworth’s departure from Brighton was being mooted and he had not yet signed with Newcastle. But the United proposal was to build a team around Murtough, whereas Ashworth was looking for the leading position — a status he is now being offered.\nWhat happens next?\nNegotiations with Newcastle over an exit will now start, but INEOS have made clear they are prepared to pay and want Ashworth in place for the summer transfer window.\nBrailsford is searching for a recruitment specialist to sit under the sporting director, and there is a desire for an appointment to happen quickly should Ashworth, whose input would be important, be confirmed.\nAppointments in those positions would, in addition to Murtough, raise questions about the futures of technical director Darren Fletcher and head of scouting operations Steve Brown.\nSources at the club believe there are several adept staff members who have the capacity to do better work when empowered by strong leadership. Brailsford endorsed a sentiment for unlocking potential when speaking to football staff in his first week, and he struck a similar theme when addressing the players on January 29. He explained the importance of standards and the pressures of high performance. The talk was said to have been well received and more motivational messages can be expected.\n(Top image: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United via Getty Images; Additional reporting: David Ornstein and Adam Crafton)",
