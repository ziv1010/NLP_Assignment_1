  "body_text": "The sun was out this week and Tettenhall was abuzz.\nLocals chatted over breakfast at its numerous coffee shops, pensioners were deep in conversation on the benches overlooking the village green and shoppers flitted around alongside estate agents and accountants.\nNobody had to go far to find discussion over the loss of the most celebrated residents of recent times. Ruben Neves is moving out and Tettenhall — and Wolverhampton down the road — will miss him.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s good for him that he’s managed to make his mark and then get a move, but it’s a real shame that he won’t be back here,” says Jamie Cope, who has cut Neves’ hair at his salon in Tettenhall Arcade since shortly after the Portugal international signed for Wolverhampton Wanderers in the summer of 2017.\n“He’s really embraced life here, just popping into all the local shops, the coffee shops, the greengrocers, whatever. He’s just a normal guy. He’s had a massive impact on the community in Wolverhampton. There are a lot of children that love him — and adults too.\n“He’s well known in this arcade. He goes to Gluttons For Nourishment for his breakfast, or a coffee with his wife, quite a lot.\n“He’s just well respected and it was right when they made him captain because he does deserve it.”\nView this post on Instagram\nThere is a sense around Wolves that Neves has timed his departure perfectly after six years of excellence on the pitch.\nWolves are attempting this summer to draw a line under a glorious era that has now run out of road and build a new identity under current head coach Julen Lopetegui.\nNeves’ departure, for a surprise new footballing home in Saudi Arabia, provides the cash to help ease the financial fair play issues that will dominate the club’s summer business and the clarity for Lopetegui to put his stamp on the team he inherited last November without the most dominant on-field figure from previous regimes dictating how he needs to set them up.\nBut there is sadness, too, that the fans will no longer get to see the finest Wolves player in half a century pull the strings at Molineux. There were also tears in Neves’ eyes as he said goodbye on Friday.\nA message from @rubendsneves_… pic.twitter.com/tWAcfnkp5q\n— Wolves (@Wolves) June 23, 2023\nIt is a sadness that is felt even more keenly in this leafy village, two miles north west of the city centre, that Wolves’ sizable contingent of Portuguese and Spanish imports have made their home since the Fosun takeover of 2016.\nGO DEEPER\nHow Wolves players have created a mini Portugal in the West Midlands\n“It is really sad to see them go but it is probably the right time, especially for Wolves,” says Mark Hodgkiss, owner of Mode Menswear and a Wolves supporter. “It’s nice cash in the bank.\nAdvertisement\n“I see Ruben around the village quite a lot, and in Cataldo’s (the Italian restaurant and deli in the heart of the village). He is always really polite. He always says ‘Hello, how are you?’. He and his wife (Debora Lourenco) always seem really happy when you see them out and about, or walking the dogs. They have really embraced where they live and the local community.\n“Rui Patricio (Wolves goalkeeper from 2018-21) was a really good customer of mine and he and his wife, Vera, came in to see me just before they left for Roma. She explained that their kids were born in Wolverhampton and it was all they knew. All of their friends were from Wolverhampton and they went to school here and it’ll be the same with Ruben.\n“I don’t think people consider that enough. As much as it is work for them, it is life as well and they have forged friendships here so it will be a big wrench for them.”\nGO DEEPER\nErling Haaland is an exception - adapting to a new environment in football is hard\nNeves has been making an impact in these parts since top agent Jorge Mendes persuaded him to swap Champions League football with Porto in his homeland for the Championship a year into Fosun’s ambitious ownership of the club.\n“We didn’t know much about him,” says John Ruddy, the promotion-winning goalkeeper who arrived at Wolves in the same summer as Neves. “He came in with the likes of Diogo Jota and Willy Boly, and we didn’t know much about any of them.\n“Fairly quickly into that pre-season in Austria, we could see the quality. Nuno (Espirito Santo, then Wolves’ head coach) was building something and Ruben was a massive part of it. And once we got into the games we could immediately see his awareness and the way he would find the space he required.\n“He was so young then, so to be able to play so well and dictate games in a league like the Championship was impressive to watch up close.”\nNeves became the poster boy of the best Wolves era for generations, enjoying the full journey from the Championship title to successive top-seven finishes in the Premier League, an FA Cup semi-final and a Europa League quarter-final.\nAdvertisement\nEvery fan has a favourite Neves memory, from the match-winning free kick in the Championship away to Cardiff City to the wonderful strike on his Premier League debut against Everton, an FA Cup thunderbolt against Liverpool and a Europa League one versus Espanyol.\nBut for many supporters, it is hard to look beyond his iconic goal at home to Derby County en route to promotion in his debut season.\nGO DEEPER\nThe Mona Lisa with Insta filters: Which is Ruben Neves’ best goal for Wolves?\n“I was invited for dinner with my girlfriends to the hallowed ground,” recalls Suzi Perry, the television presenter and avid Wolves fan. “We were on the way up and the vibe was so positive at Molineux, the dream was on. We got to chat with Nuno before the game, had some banter with ‘Bully’ (the club’s record goalscorer Steve Bull) and we settled in for the match.\n“My god, what a goal! It has to be one of the greatest I’ve seen. So skilful and so instinctive, I still watch it and smile. You don’t see many of those in your lifetime. Like everyone we all lost ourselves celebrating, happily lost in this mindblowing moment, so privileged to witness this magic; Neves the wonderkid.\n“Ruben did an interview in our box afterwards and it topped a perfect night, he was so eloquent, speaking in a second language and he had just turned 22!”\nMy 👑🐺🧡 #WOLEVE pic.twitter.com/lipcwW70dv\n— Suzi Perry 🌻 (@suziperry) May 20, 2023\nNeves grew from boy wonder into captain marvel, taking over the armband last summer when long-time skipper Conor Coady departed to Everton on loan. It was a change of style, from Coady’s effervescent leadership to his quiet authority, but the Portugal international grew into the role.\nWhen post-match inquests were required into goals conceded or refereeing errors, the players would crowd around Neves’ phone to watch them before leaving the changing room. When cases needed to be made to match officials, it was Neves who accompanied the head coach (Bruno Lage, then Lopetegui) into the referees’ dressing room.\nAdvertisement\n“He’s more of a leader by example on the pitch,” Ruddy says. “He’s not a screamer or a shouter but he’s so respected that when he does speak, everybody listens — and more often than not he talks sense. It was a natural progression to make him captain. Whoever the manager was, he knew what was required and they knew they could trust him implicitly on the pitch.”\nThe change of tone from Coady’s captaincy was clear off the pitch, too.\nYet such was Neves’ presence after years of excellence on the field, he was an effective ambassador for the club within the local community.\n“He is so different to Conor, and over the last five or six years Conor has always been the frontman, in terms of our stuff and being an ambassador for the foundation,” says Tom Warren, senior manager for projects at the Wolves Foundation, the club’s charitable arm.\n“But whenever we’ve had Ruben, he’s been brilliant. He’s a serious guy but he’s warm.\n“Whenever he was around kids, he had this ability to warm up. A door would open and he’d be in front of kids who essentially idolised him and he had this way of coming alive.\nGO DEEPER\nRuben Neves' transfer to Saudi Arabia suits Wolves - but won't change their summer plans\n“On a matchday, when the players come out before the game and have a walk on the pitch, he would be really good at spotting the mascots standing around and going over — it was a bit more natural then, rather than when there were cameras around.\n“Ruben has a real aura and presence to him. He was the same early on and as he’s grown up he’s got even more of it.”\nJust over a year ago, the Neves family’s bond with Wolverhampton was further underlined by a surprise call to the Good Shepherd, a homeless shelter. Wife Debora contacted the charity on social media offering food and other items, making two big donations, with the couple on hand to load the goods into the Good Shepherd van in person.\nAdvertisement\n“The Good Shepherd has been fortunate for many years to have so much different support from Wolves players, who have taken such a keen interest in the charity and made sure they provide help when they can,” its chief executive Tom Hayden says.\n“For Ruben and Debora to get in touch as they did, and make such substantial donations, was extremely kind and thoughtful.\n“It shows that Ruben is more than just a great footballer and takes an interest in the community around him, and it had such a positive impact on our service users. You can imagine how well it was received by those people who need help from the Good Shepherd — to know that they were receiving items from such a well-known Wolves footballer.”\nWolves will move on without Neves. The club have already begun a midfield evolution involving last summer’s signing Boubacar Traore and January arrivals Mario Lemina and Joao Gomes.\nOther new faces will follow and, in time, new heroes will emerge. But like Billy Wright, John Richards, Bull and many others for previous generations of Wolves fans, Neves has made an indelible mark on the team, the club, the city and the community. His legacy will live on.\n“Ruben is so easy to get on with,” Tettenhall barber Cope says. “A lot of people when they see him say, ‘Oh, God, it’s Ruben Neves’. But with me, we’d broken the ice in that he knew I didn’t support Wolves so I wasn’t going to act like a fanboy.\n“He’s just like your next-door neighbour. There’s no air about him that he thinks he’s something special because he’s a footballer. He’s just normal and easy to talk to. It will be a real shame for the Wolves fans to lose him because he’s the best player they’ve had for a long time, on and off the pitch.”\n“It was an absolute pleasure to share the dressing room with him as a footballer but also to get to know him as a person and understand what makes him tick,” adds Ruddy. “He’s a very family-oriented person, Debora is lovely as well, as are the children. He and his family settled really well, they’re very comfortable in the area.\nAdvertisement\n“Whatever he goes on to do after Wolves, and even after football, you would never begrudge him any success because he has worked for it and deserves it.\n“He’s probably been there a couple of years longer than expected due to a few factors — Covid-19 and transfers not quite happening. But I don’t think anybody who has watched Wolves over the last six years would begrudge him any success that he goes on to have.”\nGO DEEPER\nMendes' DNA is all over Neves move to Al Hilal - there will be a longer-term plan too\n(Top photos: Getty Images, Jamie Cope, the Good Shepherd and The Athletic)",
