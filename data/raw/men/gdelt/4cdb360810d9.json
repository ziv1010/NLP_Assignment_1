  "body_text": "The week before El Clasico always throws up drama as Spain’s two biggest sides gear up for the biggest match of the domestic calendar.\nThe build-up to Saturday’s encounter at Barcelona’s Montjuic stadium was dominated by whether Real Madrid president Florentino Perez would be in attendance after a number of flashpoints between the clubs. On Thursday night, it was confirmed he would not travel to Catalonia for a third consecutive game.\nGO DEEPER\nEl Clasico: Real Madrid and Barcelona's week of tension won't change their alliance\nIn terms of the football, much has been made of which players will return from injury. Jude Bellingham confirmed he would be available for the Clasico in a TV interview on Thursday after suffering groin discomfort in Madrid’s midweek Champions League game against Braga, while Barca surprised everyone when five of their six sidelined players — Pedri, Frenkie de Jong, Robert Lewandowski, Jules Kounde and Raphinha — took part in training on Friday morning.\nAdvertisement\nMadrid could go back above Girona into top spot with a win while Barca have the opportunity to leapfrog their rivals. So, how will each side line up?\nThe Athletic’s Barcelona and Real Madrid writers discuss…\nMario Cortegana (Real Madrid writer): The first Clasico of the season — finally! I feel like talking about something more football-related after the institutional tensions of the last few days.\nGuillermo Rai (Real Madrid writer): Agreed! Even if Toni Kroos said on his podcast that three points at this stage don’t mean that much, this game is always a decisive moment because it can provide a huge confidence boost to either team.\nPol Ballus (Barcelona writer): Injuries have been a big talking point for Barcelona this week. Xavi said in his press conference that he would play the absentees “if they tell me they’re 100 per cent”. You were there Laia, did you get the impression any of the injured group could start tomorrow?\nLaia Cervello Herrero (Barcelona writer): Xavi seemed really optimistic in his presser when he said all the injured players could feature; not many people saw that coming. But it wouldn’t make sense for players who have been sidelined for months, such as Pedri, to be rushed back into a match as tense as El Clasico. Apart from him, I don’t think any of them will start.\nGoalkeepers and defence\nMario: There is no doubt about Kepa Arrizabalaga’s place in goal. In defence, it is hard to argue against Dani Carvajal at right-back after the Spaniard’s fine start to the season. Antonio Rudiger has been decent too and has been Madrid’s best defender on form this season.\nGuillermo: Eder Militao’s long-term anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury makes it pretty simple in defence — except at left-back. Ferland Mendy played just 20 minutes against Braga as Carlo Ancelotti rested him and I think he will start there. Ancelotti likes Eduardo Camavinga in that position but Mendy is more robust defensively. In his press conference today (Friday), the Italian said that Mendy had “an advantage because he has been rested in the Champions League”.\nAdvertisement\nMario: Reports in Spain today suggested Mendy would start and Camavinga would be dropped to the bench. I have sounded out people at Valdebebas, Madrid’s training ground, and they say Camavinga is likely to be a substitute.\nGO DEEPER\nReal Madrid's problem position: Why Garcia and Mendy have yet to solve left-back dilemma\nGuillermo: I have spoken to Mendy’s entourage and they think he will start, given the rotations in midweek — but with Ancelotti, you never know. We said the same when Madrid travelled to Girona last month and Camavinga started there.\nPol: The biggest talking point in terms of Barca’s line-up is in defence: with Joao Cancelo in the team, does Xavi still use Ronald Araujo as Vinicius Junior’s kryptonite at right-back or does he trust in his Portuguese summer loan signing from Manchester City?\nLaia: Leaving Cancelo on the bench is a risk in terms of player management and dressing-room harmony. We know how disgruntled Cancelo became at City when he didn’t play. But given some sloppy errors in possession in recent games, I see him playing a more advanced role — more like a winger. That would leave the right-back spot for Araujo, with the centre-backs being Andreas Christensen and Inigo Martinez, and Alejandro Balde at left-back.\nPol: Xavi seemed to drop a huge hint about this in his press conference. He insisted that Barca needed to minimise the number of times they lost possession in the build-up and said they had to coordinate their high press and recoveries better. This is the weakest aspect of Cancelo’s game; he is a force in attack but he has flaws defensively.\nYou only need to look at their last game in midweek against Shakhtar Donetsk to see how Cancelo was totally out of place for the goal Barca conceded. The side’s excellent defensive record last season was largely down to playing with an extra centre-back as a right-back. What they lost in creativity they gained in defence — and Xavi wants to recover that for the Clasico.\nAdvertisement\nMidfield\nLaia: Barca have two options here: the conservative one and the brave one.\nThe cautious approach would be to start Oriol Romeu, Xavi’s only holding midfielder, and try to create a system that protects him. The risky choice would be to take a chance on Fermin Lopez. This would involve Ilkay Gundogan dropping back into a defensive midfield role and trusting in Gavi, Fermin and Joao Felix to combine in attack.\nGO DEEPER\nPunishing presser, tough tackler, slick passer: Romeu is exactly what Barca need\nPol: The way Fermin has burst into the team has been impressive and he took his goal against Shakhtar well, but I don’t think Xavi will drop Romeu for him. Romeu has been far from his best and opponents target him as Barca’s weak point, but my guess would be that Xavi saves Fermin as a potential game-changer from the bench.\nMario: Midfield was where Madrid lost the Madrid derby last month — Ancelotti started with five players in that position — but I think the manager has learned his lesson.\nI expect Ancelotti to start Aurelien Tchouameni, as Madrid have not lost a game in which the Frenchman has featured from the start this season. The team is more balanced with him and Toni Kroos, who brings the know-how the younger players do not possess. Federico Valverde is another pillar for Ancelotti, while Bellingham is indisputable and has been Madrid’s best player so far this season. What do you think, Guillermo?\nGuillermo: It would be more interesting for the reader if we disagreed, so I’m sorry to say I’m 100 per cent with you. The big change for Madrid this season has been Bellingham’s arrival and his role as a No 10 at the tip of Ancelotti’s midfield diamond: 11 goals in 12 games for the Englishman speaks for itself.\nGO DEEPER\nWhy Real Madrid's versatile midfield is their super-strength\nMario: Full credit to Carlo!\nGuillermo: The other great novelty has been Tchouameni consolidating his place at the base of midfield. That is why Ancelotti is able to leave out Camavinga for a game of this magnitude.\nAdvertisement\nAttack\nLaia: If Cancelo plays as a right winger, then Barca would only have two free spots in attack. That would mean Yamal missing out despite his fine performances this season.\nGO DEEPER\nLamine Yamal: Barcelona's young prodigy and the proud neighbourhood that shaped him\nPol: One of those spots has to be for Joao Felix given how well he has played since joining from Atletico Madrid on loan. Then it’s either Ferran Torres or Lewandowski, with Yamal playing a similar impact role to Fermin from the bench.\nOf the injured players, Lewandowski is clearly the player with the best chance of starting. His injury is not a muscle problem and he has not been sidelined for as long as Frenkie de Jong. But his camp says it is not guaranteed he will start. If I had to guess, I’d say Torres will start.\nMario: Before Madrid’s win against Braga, I didn’t see Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo starting together up front — given the latter’s poor form. But after Joselu was left out of that match due to flu-like symptoms and Rodrygo’s goal — his first since the opening weekend of the season — it makes sense for him to play. Having said that, both he and Joselu are great options to accompany Vinicus Jr, who seems back to his best after returning from injury.\nGuillermo: The other debate for Madrid — apart from who should start at left-back — was whether Ancelotti should leave Rodrygo out of the starting XI. But a coach should always place emphasis on younger players like Rodrygo, and having Joselu as a second-half substitute is no bad thing.\nHow do you think each side will line up?\nPol: For Madrid, the main doubt seems to be at left-back, but Ancelotti seems to trust Camavinga more than Mendy in big games. It also solves another problem for him, as it opens up a spot for another midfielder in the line-up. Luka Modric will be benched again as he’s far from his best and Ancelotti will continue to trust the structure they’ve built so far.\nLaia: I see Madrid playing with four midfielders in their usual diamond formation to control the centre of the park and avoid giving Barca space.\nMario: It’s difficult to predict Barca’s XI given the doubts they have in their squad. From what I’ve read and what Xavi said in his press conference today, I think it could be something like this…\nGuillermo: Despite the injuries, Barca have one of the largest benches in La Liga and will have no problems putting out a competitive XI. If everyone recovers in time, I see Xavi’s side lining up like this…\nPredictions\nPol: I think it will be an open game; Barcelona have become a more creative team this season with Cancelo and Joao Felix, but the defensive frailties they have shown mean Madrid will get chances on the counter… 2-2.\nAdvertisement\nLaia: Both teams will want to control the game, but I see this ending 1-0 to Barca with a Joao Felix goal.\nGuillermo: I don’t want to jinx it, but I predict a match with lots of goals ending in a 3-1 win for Madrid.\nMario: That’s very optimistic! I’m going to say 2-1 to Real with goals from Ronald Araujo, two assists from Vinicius Jr, a goal from Rodrygo — and one from Bellingham, of course.\nGuillermo: Who else?\n(Top photos: Getty Images)",
