  "body_text": "Aston Villa are set to face RB Leipzig in Germany tonight (December 10) for their UEFA Champions League match. The encounter comes on the heels of Villa's back-to-back Premier League victories and Amazon Prime members can watch for free.\nThe match between RB Leipzig and Aston Villa is scheduled for an 8pm kick-off, with coverage led by Gabby Logan from 6.30pm alongside Josephine Henning, Roberto Martinez and Thomas Hitzlsperger. Earlier this year, Unai Emery's team had a pre-season friendly against the same opponents in New Jersey, which ended in a 2-0 loss for Villa. In that game, Diego Carlos was sent off after a clash with Leipzig's Lois Openda.\nVilla may have to do without Leon Bailey for Tuesday's match, as the winger suffered a hamstring injury. Speaking to Birmingham Live's John Townley, Emery said: \"I think he will be out, hopefully not a lot of weeks but Tuesday I don't think he will be available. We have to try and use our other players and give them chances. It's a hamstring issue.\"\nBoth teams have had similar starts to their domestic seasons, with Leipzig currently fourth in the Bundesliga with seven wins, while Villa sit sixth in the Premier League also with seven victories, including their recent 1-0 win over Southampton on Saturday (December 7).\nVilla, currently sitting ninth in the Champions League table after a goalless draw with Juventus and a 2-0 defeat to Club Brugge, are set to face RB Leipzig, who are yet to secure a point in the competition.\nCommentary will be provided by Jon Champion and Alan Shearer. The game can be watched for free on Amazon's Prime Video for those with an Amazon Prime subscription or those who sign up for an Amazon Prime 30-day free trial reports The Mirror.\nPrime Video will also broadcast this year's Premier League Boxing Day fixtures on December 26-27, including Newcastle United vs Aston Villa. All Champions League and Europa League games are also available on TNT Sports, which costs £30.99 on a rolling monthly plan with Discovery+ Premium.\nTNT Sports is not just about football, they also air NBA, Premiership Rugby, MotoGP, UFC, Boxing and WWE. Meanwhile, Sky Sports remains the go-to for domestic football action, covering the Premier League, EFL and more.\nThe broadcaster has recently revamped its TV packages with the introduction of the new Essential TV and Sky Sports bundle.
