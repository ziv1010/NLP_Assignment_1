  "body_text": "Liverpool face a reunion with Trent Alexander-Arnold as Real Madrid head to Anfield in the league phase of the Champions League.\nThe former academy product left the club over the summer after more than 20 years on Merseyside but will return with his new side in a meeting of the 2018 and 2022 finalists.\nAdvertisement\nThe two clubs met a year ago at Anfield too. Arne Slot’s team came through 2-0 winners, with Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo on the scoresheet.\nWho have they drawn?\nLiverpool will have home games against Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, PSV Eindhoven and Qarabag.\nThe away games in the league phase will be against Inter, Eintracht Frankfurt, Marseille and Galatasaray.\nWhich game looks exciting?\nIt has to be Real Madrid at home. The atmosphere will be electric for Alexander-Arnold’s homecoming. He ultimately got a great send-off when he left his boyhood club following the Premier League title triumph in May.\nHowever, he will know that Anfield will be considerably less welcoming on his return. It will add an extra edge to a battle between two of the genuine heavyweights of European football. Remember Conor Bradley’s crunching tackle on Kylian Mbappe last season? The sequel is going to be mouth-watering.\nI’m also very excited about the fact that the game against Qarabag is at home rather than involving a 5,000-mile round trip to Azerbaijan. And the trip to Eintracht Frankfurt also jumps out. Liverpool haven’t faced them since 1972 and it will be a special night for striker Hugo Ekitike, who moved from Frankfurt in a £79million deal last month.\nWhich game is most worrying?\nFacing last season’s finalists Inter is certainly the trickiest away trip. However, Slot and his players will have happy memories of San Siro from last season’s league phase victory against Milan.\nMuch depends on the scheduling of these fixtures. For example, Liverpool have a lunchtime Saturday kick-off in the Merseyside derby at Anfield after matchday one next month. They travel to Chelsea in the Premier League after matchday two in October and then it’s Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium after matchday four in November.\nAdvertisement\nLiverpool have happy memories of Istanbul from the iconic 2005 final but you don’t want the trip to Turkey to face Galatasaray to fall shortly before one of your most energy-sapping domestic assignments of the season.\nWhat will Arne Slot have learned from last season in the Champions League?\nThe biggest takeaway for Slot was that finishing first in the expanded league phase counts for little come the knockout stages.\nLiverpool won seven in a row before losing their final match away to PSV Eindhoven in January with a shadow line-up. Their ‘reward’ for top spot was a tough round-of-16 tie against eventual winners Paris Saint-Germain, who had somehow conspired to finish 15th. Liverpool were beaten on penalties after a 1-1 draw on aggregate with Luis Enrique’s side.\nSlot felt that fatigue played a part in their exit, with the games against PSG coming towards the end of a gruelling run of fixtures before the March international break. The Liverpool head coach is expected to rotate his options to a greater extent this time around.\nWho could be a breakthrough talent in the competition this year?\nRio Ngumoha. The fearless teenage winger announced himself to the world with a dramatic late winner on his Premier League debut at Newcastle United on Monday night.\nAnd now Ngumoha, who turns 17 on Friday, will have his sights set on gracing Europe’s elite club competition for the first time.\nLiverpool haven’t signed a direct replacement for Luis Diaz, who was sold to Bayern Munich, because they want to leave the pathway clear for the gifted youngster. He will get opportunities to shine in the Champions League this season.\nWhich team do Liverpool most want to avoid in the latter stages?\nGiven that Liverpool have genuine aspirations to go all the way in the Champions League this season, I don’t think they will be too bothered who they face.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, avoiding PSG in the last 16 again would be helpful. The holders look like the team to beat once again and that revenge mission can wait until further down the line.\nIf the two clubs end up on different sides of the draw then I wouldn’t be surprised if they meet again at Budapest’s Puskas Arena on May 30 next year.\nWhat would be considered a successful finish?\nSo much depends on how quickly Slot’s new-look team gel, as their opening two Premier League matches have shown up defensive vulnerability and some issues to sort out in terms of the balance of the side.\nIf Slot can make those adjustments and keep key personnel fit and firing then they will certainly expect to go deep into the knockout stages.\nWhich is more important — defending the Premier League or winning the Champions League?\nDepends who you speak to. Liverpool haven’t retained the English league title since the early 1980s so that’s a huge target for players, staff and supporters this season.\nHowever, there’s also a real determination to go further in the Champions League. They haven’t added to their haul of six European Cups since 2019 and Slot believes they can sustain a challenge on both fronts.\nThere was a nagging sense of what might have been last season after losing on penalties to the eventual winners. Liverpool peaked too early in the competition as they ruthlessly swept German champions Bayer Leverkusen and Spanish champions Madrid aside in the league phase.\nThe fact that the 2026 final will be played in Budapest will be a source of even greater motivation for Liverpool’s Hungarian duo of Dominik Szoboszlai and Milos Kerkez.\nPrediction time — how far will Liverpool get?\nIt’s tricky trying to second guess what kind of shape Liverpool will be in when the stakes are high next spring. But I’m pretty certain they will reach at least the semi-finals.\nAdvertisement\nIf Slot rotates more often and they don’t fade like they did last season then there’s no reason why Liverpool can’t claim a seventh European crown.\nUCL and Premier League fixtures\nSep 14: Burnley (A)\nSep 17: Atletico Madrid (H)\nSep 20: Everton (H)\nSep 27: Crystal Palace (A)\nSep 30: Galatasaray (A)\nOct 4: Chelsea (A)\nOct 19: Manchester United (H)\nOct 22: Eintracht Frankfurt (A)\nOct 25: Brentford (A)\nNov 1: Aston Villa (H)\nNov 4: Real Madrid (H)\nNov 8: Manchester City (A)\nNov 22: Nottingham Forest (H)\nNov 26: PSV (H)\nNov 29: West Ham (A)\nDec 6: Leeds (A)\nDec 9: Inter (A)\nDec 13: Brighton (H)\nJan 17: Burnley (H)\nJan 21: Marseille (A)\nJan 24: Bournemouth (A)\nJan 28: Qarabag (H)\nJan 31: Newcastle (H)\nPremier League dates subject to change.\n(Top photo: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)",
