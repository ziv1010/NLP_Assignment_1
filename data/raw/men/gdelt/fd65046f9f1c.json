Celtic’s fairytale, like so many before it, died in that moment of Bavarian cruelty. Another Scottish heart, broken on German soil.\nBut they weren’t alone in their misery on this bitter February evening.\nDark Forces in Italy\nIn Milan, the proud Il Diavolo faced his own demons. The seven-time European champions, their iconic red and black stripes now seeming more like prison bars, watched helplessly as their stadium – the cathedral of European football – was stormed by a group of Dutch youngsters from Feyenoord. The same San Siro that once housed the dreams of Van Basten and Maldini now bore witness to Milan’s second-ever elimination by Dutch opposition in the Champions League knockout stages, a painful echo of their 1995 final loss to Ajax.\nThe night’s cruelty showed no bounds in Bergamo, where Atalanta’s faithful gathered to witness what they hoped would be another chapter in their fairy tale European journey. Instead, they watched their team squander chance after chance, their 3.57 expected goals mocking them from the statistician’s sheet as Club Brugge, with just 1.15 xG, executed them with clinical precision. The sight of Rafael Tolói trudging off after his late red card embodied the death of their dreams – not with a bang, but with a whimper.\nThriller with Benfica\nEven Monaco, who fought valiantly in a six-goal thriller against Benfica, couldn’t escape the evening’s ruthless narrative. Their 3-3 draw proved insufficient, marking their fourth consecutive failure to reach the promised land of the round of 16. George Ilenikhena’s 81st-minute goal, rather than being a moment of triumph, served only as a bitter reminder of what could have been.\nFor the vanquished, the Champions League anthem will now ring hollow until next season – if they make it back at all. Milan must rebuild from the ashes of a defeat to a team making their first-ever round of 16 appearance since rebranding. Atalanta’s golden generation sees another opportunity slip through their fingers. Celtic’s wait for a meaningful European triumph continues to stretch into the distance. Monaco’s young stars must wonder if their chance at glory will ever come.\nKeep Your Head Up\nMeanwhile, the victors march on, their dreams still alive, their supporters still singing. But in the cruel world of European football, they too must know that their own moment of heartbreak might be just one game away. For now, though, they can celebrate – until Friday’s draw reminds them that in the Champions League, joy is always borrowed, and pain is merely deferred.\nThe floodlights will dim across Europe’s great stadiums but the memories of these defeats will burn much longer in the minds of players and fans alike. Such is the beautiful agony of the Champions League – where dreams soar highest just before they crash, and where glory and despair are separated by the finest of margins, or in Bayern’s case, 93 minutes and 12 seconds of hope before the executioner’s blade finally fell.",
