  "body_text": "Marcus Rashford’s transfer to Aston Villa appears to already be creating tension at the club ahead of the player’s potential debut in the FA Cup.\nThe forward ended his Manchester United exile in the final days of the January transfer window as he secured a surprise loan move to Villa Park.\nFollowing a difficult 18 months at Old Trafford, the England international is looking to revive his career, a quest that could begin on Sunday when Villa host Tottenham.\nUnai Emery named Rashford on the bench for the FA Cup fourth round clash.\nAhead of the game, it was also announced that Rashford had been included in Villa’s Champions League squad for the rest of the campaign, alongside fellow loan signings Axel Disasi and Marco Asensio.\nHowever, as UEFA rules dictate that only three players can be added to the squad, Emery has had to leave out permanent additions Donyell Malen and Andres Garcia.\nRight-back Garcia’s omission was predicted but Malen, a £19million forward from Borussia Dortmund, was expecting to make the cut.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nIt was somewhat of a coup for the Villans to buy the Dutch international, who scored 15 goals last season as Dortmund reached the Champions League final.\nAnd as a permanent signing, many fans were expecting the 26-year-old to be included ahead of loanees Rashford and Asensio\nExplaining the decision, Emery said: ‘Of course, it’s not a good decision I had to take yesterday, but I spoke with Andres and Donyell to tell them the decision and I argued my decision with them.\n‘I spoke with him [Malen] and tried to be honest and knowing it was not fair for him. But the necessary decision I had to take was in that direction.’\nMore Trending\nBut despite this chat, The Athletic report that Malen was left ‘deeply disappointed’ by his exclusion.\nIt is also noted that Emery was practically obliged to include Rashford and Asensio as one of the main factors behind signing for Villa was the promise of Champions League football, while Disasi made the cut thanks to a shortage of defensive options.\nVilla are paying at least 75 per cent of Rashford’s £325,000-per-week wages and do have the option to buy the United man at the end of the season for £40m.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Ruben Amorim issued warning about treatment of ‘confused’ Man Utd star\nMORE: Arsenal, Man Utd and Liverpool all show ‘strong interest’ in 20-year-old Swede",
