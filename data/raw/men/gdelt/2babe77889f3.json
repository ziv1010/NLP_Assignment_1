  "body_text": "Super Eagles head coach Eric Chelle is set to announce his final 23-man squad this week ahead of Nigeria’s crucial 2026 World Cup qualifying fixtures against Rwanda and Zimbabwe later this month, PUNCH Sports Extra reports.\nThe Malian tactician, who released an expanded provisional squad of 39 players last week, has kept the Nigerian football community waiting as fans eagerly anticipate his selection for what will be his debut matches in charge of the three-time African champions.\nChelle’s appointment comes at a critical juncture for Nigerian football, with the Super Eagles’ World Cup qualification hopes hanging by a thread after a disastrous start to their campaign that has yielded only three points from a possible 12.\nThe expanded provisional squad features an intriguing blend of experienced campaigners and exciting young talents, signalling Chelle’s intention to revitalise a team that has struggled for form and consistency in recent outings.\nAmong the notable inclusions in the provisional squad is veteran captain Ahmed Musa, whose return has been widely welcomed by supporters. As the most-capped player in Nigerian football history, Musa’s leadership qualities could prove invaluable as the team navigates through this challenging period.\nThe squad also features first-time call-ups for in-form striker Tolu Arokodare and promising midfielder Chrisantus Uche, both of whom have been making waves in European football this season.\nOther notable inclusions are Fulham’s Alex Iwobi, Bayer Leverkusen forward Victor Boniface, and Galatasaray striker Victor Osimhen, all of whom will be expected to play pivotal roles in the upcoming fixtures.\nPUNCH Sports Extra has learnt that the Malian tactician is expected to release the squad list this week, after the end of the Champions League last-16 games on Wednesday with the team set to resume camp in Kigali on Sunday ahead of the encounters.\nThe Super Eagles’ current predicament stems from a disastrous start to their qualification campaign. The team has drawn against Lesotho, Zimbabwe, and South Africa while suffering a shocking defeat to Benin Republic, leaving them fifth in Group C with just three points.\nThis situation bears an uncomfortable resemblance to their 2022 World Cup qualification campaign, where they lost their ticket to Ghana on away goals after a 1-1 aggregate draw in the final playoff round.\nThe upcoming fixtures against Rwanda in Kigali on March 21 and Zimbabwe at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium in Uyo on March 25 have therefore taken on must-win status, with anything less than six points likely to severely damage Nigeria’s chances of qualifying for the tournament to be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico, and Canada.\nRwanda currently lead Group C, making the away fixture in Kigali particularly challenging and potentially decisive for Nigeria’s qualification hopes.\nAs the countdown to the crucial double-header continues, all eyes will be on Chelle’s final selection, which will provide the first real insight into his tactical philosophy and approach to managing one of Africa’s footballing powerhouses.",
