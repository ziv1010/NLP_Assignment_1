The 24-year-old Netherlands international forward has made only three starts in the Premier League so far this season, while in the 2024/25 campaign, he started 14 times in the league.\nTEAMtalk’s transfer correspondent, Fraser Fletcher, has long reported AS Roma’s interest in Zirkzee, who has now decided that enough is enough and has agreed to move to the Italian club.\nAccording to La Gazzetta dello Sport, ‘the current situation’ at Man Utd ‘can no longer make him happy, which is precisely why Zirkzee has already said yes to Roma’.\nThe report has added: ‘This happened in recent days, when the player had a series of discussions and contacts with both the Roma management (particularly sporting director Ricky Massara) and the Giallorossi coach, Gian Piero Gasperini, who reassured him about his future role in the Giallorossi.’\nZirkzee ‘has already given’ Roma ‘his full approval, effectively promising himself to Roma’.\nThe respected Italian publication has claimed that Roma and Man Utd are ‘expected to close the deal’ on a loan move which will become an obligation next summer for between €38 and €40million (up to £35m, $47m).\nThis follows Fabrizio Romano’s claim that Roma have made an offer to Man Utd for Zirkzee.\nThe transfer guru said on his Italian language YouTube channel: “Manchester United have confirmed that they have received an official offer from Roma for Joshua Zirkzee.\n“It is a loan deal with a conditional obligation to buy, and Manchester United have confirmed, through intermediaries, that they have received this proposal from Roma.\n“Manchester United, as I told you in the days before Christmas, are taking their time.”\nWant more breaking transfer lines from original sources?

He’s a player who can adapt very well to the coach’s style of play, because he can operate both in the attacking midfield and as a roaming striker.\n“He has quality and can really help turn Roma’s attacking problems around. He, along with that guy I always defended last year, even when things weren’t going well.”\nLatest Man Utd transfer news: Rio Ferdinand praise, Real Madrid media ridicule\nMeanwhile, a midfielder Man Utd let go in 2021 is back on the radar of the Premier League club.\nRio Ferdinand has raved about a 2025 Man Utd summer signing, with the Red Devils legend claiming that he will be at Old Trafford “for the next 10 years, no doubt”.\nAnd finally, the Real Madrid media have ridiculed a Man Utd player who once publicly revealed his ‘love’ for Los Blancos and his desire to join the Spanish powerhouse.",
