In addition to that, they won the inaugural African Football League in November, defeating Wydad Casablanca in the final.\nThey are coached by the very highly-rated Rulani Mokwena, who having only just turned 37 is from a different generation to Broos.\nFriction has appeared between them, with Mokwena not happy when one of his many international stars returns injured from Bafana Bafana duty.\n\"The coach of Sundowns, he is the local Mourinho. He has won a lot of trophies, he pretends to be God and everyone listens to what he says,\" Broos told South African media at the start of the AFCON.\nAgainst Morocco, South Africa's entire back four in front of Williams were all Sundowns players. Mokoena patrolled the midfield, with Thapelo Morena and the veteran Themba Zwane completing the Sundowns contingent.\nSouth Africans used to watching the Sundowns stars playing their sophisticated brand of football –- Mokwena has cited Brighton and Hove Albion manager Roberto de Zerbi as an influence –- may feel entitled to have big expectations of their team at this Cup of Nations.\nBroos does not have the same methods as Mokwena, but the man who led Cameroon to unexpected AFCON glory in 2017 is now hoping to do the same with South Africa.\n\"I got a lot of critics in South Africa at certain moments because of the choices I made, but I knew what I was doing,\" Broos insisted after the Morocco victory.\n\"I know the results have to follow. And even with local players, now you see they play on that high level. When they have the confidence, they can do it.\"\n© 2024 AFP",
