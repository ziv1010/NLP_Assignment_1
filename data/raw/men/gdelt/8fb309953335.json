  "body_text": "Mohamed Salah makes worrying Liverpool contract admission after Man Utd win\n- Mohamed Salah reveals no contract from Liverpool over contract extension\n- Forward scored against Man Utd on Sunday but his current deal expires next summer\n- Salah has been a major target for the Saudi Pro League\nMohamed Salah claimed nobody has talked to him about extending his contract with Liverpool after scoring in Sunday's 3-0 victory at Manchester United.\nThe Egyptian has enjoyed a storied career on Merseyside which has included Champions League and Premier League title successes and is into his eighth season at Anfield, scoring his 214th goal for the club at Old Trafford against their bitter rivals.\nHowever, his contract will expire at the end of the campaign and Salah has admitted he is playing as if this is his final season as a Reds player.\nAfter netting against United for the 15th time in his career, Salah told Sky Sports: \"I had a good summer and had a long time to myself to try to stay positive.\n\"As you know, it's my last year at the club.\n\"I just want to enjoy it and I don't want to think about it. I feel like I'm free to play football and then we'll see what happens next year.\"\nSalah previously revealed he was keen to enjoy the final year of his contract before making a decision on his future. Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold will also see their deals run out next year.\nHe added: \"Coming into the game, I said it could be the last time [I play here with Liverpool].\n\"No-one at the club has spoken to me about contracts, so I'm just like: 'OK, I'm playing my last season' and see what happens at the end of the season.\n\"It's not up to me, but nobody's talked to me from the club. We will see.\"\nSalah set up two goals for Luis Diaz before scoring his third goal of the season as Liverpool eased their way to a 3-0 over United, having found the net previously against Ipswich Town and Brentford.",
