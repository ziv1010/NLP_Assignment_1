The Blues sold the 26-year-old to Stoke City for a fee of £2.75 million rising to £3.25 million on appearances on Wednesday.\nKeane says he expects to be given the cash for more signings, although he has had no confirmation from chief executive Simon Clegg or owner Marcus Evans: “You’d hope so, yes.”\nKeane says he has players in mind to come in and is frustrated that some deals where fees have been set, so far haven’t been completed: “I’ve got them lined up. We’ve had deals agreed for one or two weeks. The fee for Jason Scotland was agreed a couple of weeks ago in terms of the clubs, it’s about getting deals done [with players].\n“It’s not my job, it’s not in my contract. I’ll give you a copy of my contract. It’s not in my contract to do contracts with agents and players. It’s a manager’s job to identify players and try and bring them to your club, but I hopefully never be sitting down with an agent and a player discussing terms. That’s up to the chief executive. We’ve got targets and we’re in talks with these clubs and these players. Bloody talks!”\nThe Town manager says there were deals earlier in the summer which also fell through: “Ten weeks ago, I had a player in my office who would have signed that afternoon, but we couldn’t do a deal for him. He’s now playing for a good team and doing well.\n“It’s not been over the last few weeks,” Keane said. “I’m talking about over the whole summer. We’ve had players who wanted to come to the football club and we’ve not done the deals. We’ll see what pans out over the next week, but I’m sure I said the same last week.”\nKeane says that despite the frustrations there is as yet no problem between him and chief executive Simon Clegg: “Not at the moment, but ask me next weekend at the end of the transfer window!\n“I can [understand where they are coming from], just as I hope they can understand where I’m coming from — we need players. We went to Exeter last week and we didn’t have enough players to sit on the bench, three days into the season.\n“We’ve been talking all summer, I spoke to the owner the other night, he’s well aware of [where the squad needs strengthening] but it’s about trying to get the right deals. I think there will be news next week, it’s not all doom and gloom. I’m quietly confident.”\nPhoto: James Ager\nPhoto: Action Images via Reuters\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nBored bored bored.\nWe are doing well at the moment lets hope it caries on, However as the season progess we will struggle to filed a side to push for the top six.\nWill Keane be gone in the next couple of weeks?\nA player signs a deal or he doesn't, if he doesn't there's a reason as to why he doesn't...\nAsk the board why these deals arn't being done, and watch your public comments.\nKeane has one year left on his contract - if Evans finds himself having to choose between Clegg and Keane who do you think he'll go for?\nA couple of poor results which Keane then publically lays the blame for at Clegg door could see this situation come to a head.\nIsn't this very similar to what happened at Sunderland?\ni am getting worried about keane being pushed out the door as i don't think ME will like his comments and if keane does go it will mean more whole sale changes cost ME more money and another 5 years in the championship. The premier league has upped the parachute payments to relegated clubs so as of next year it will be even harder to get out of the championship so ME needs in my opinion to speculate a bit.\n1. Keane formidable reputation is what he was employed for - brings attention to our club and therefore attention to Marcus Evans and his business.....\n2. if keane didnt say anything we wouldnt have a scooby doo what was going on - pity the board are not matching him by coming out and talking.\nif we loose Keane now then what, no time for a manager to bring in new players, break what is currently working and then 're build' yet again. it would be a disaster. loathe him or love him we have to back the manager until at least christmas when the transfer window re-opens and if it has all gone wrong by then well it will be time to go for sure. Clearly he is trying to bring in decent players who want a wage. he doesnt do any of the negotiation so who was it that signed a 4 year deal on 13K a week for Martin eh? Keane identified him as a player he wanted (mistake)he didnt write the contract (massive mistake).......Clegg must have thought ah Manchester oh yes good time jolly ho lets give this lad lots and lots of money and sign to keep him forever, now it is HIS mistakes we are paying for and he is probably hanging on to his job by ensuring he doesnt make the same mistake again and meaning we are missing out on decent players.\nThe big bosses are the one who said they want the club in the prem within 3 years and champions league in 5 years when the took over.\nLets not forget the amount of money he has put in to the club, but he should have said that we are stabilizing the club and are aim is prem football but not give time scales.\nME sacked Magilton and Keane signed the next day. ME must have given Magilton targets and money to do the task, However Keane was lined up as soon as ME Clegg knew the club would not be promoted and hope to wait till the end of the season before the announcment. If ME wants Keane out he has the money to say bye bye as Keane has less than year left on his contract. Just think Keane will go if he cant take the club forward and by not being allowed to strenghting the side will be the reason.\nbeing a devious businessman if web is to be believed,then could it be that he is doing this because he isnt as rich as we thought,or could it be that he hopes Roy walks so that he doesnt have to pay him off.\nEither way the supporters will just have to accept the consequences,as I feel we could struggle unless we have a couple of new faces in the squad by the end of the month\nBut I won't put money on it.\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
