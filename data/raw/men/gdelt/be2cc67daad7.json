  "body_text": "Three talking points from Barcelona 4-0 Borussia Dortmund\nThe Catalans win Champions League quarter-final first leg\nBarcelona’s 4-0 win over Dortmund means the Catalans have one foot in the semi-finals ahead of the return in Germany next week.\nBefore the game, Hansi Flick had called on his side to get the job done at Montjuic and take a strong result to Signal Iduna Park and his men did exactly that.\nGoals from Raphinha, Robert Lewandowski and Lamine Yamal mean Barca are in great shape to reach the semi-finals and a tie against Inter or Bayern Munich.\nThe win was so comprehensive there was even time for Ansu Fati to emerge from the bench with a big smile for his first minutes since January. It was that kind of night.\nBarca now just need to see it out next week in Germany. Yet Hansi Flick will fancy his team to keep on scoring, particularly as they have already won 3-2 at Dortmund this season.\nRaphinha returns and matches Messi\nRaphinha headed into the match on the back of some unwelcome headlines after losing his cool following the weekend’s draw with Betis.\nYet the Brazilian managed to put all that aside with an influential performance, grabbing a goal and two assists for Flick’s side to maintain his great form n the competition.\nThat’s now 19 goal involvements in the Champions League this season, matching Lionel Messi’s record.\nThe opening goal will go down to Raphinha but it really should belong to Pau Cubarsi. The teenager’s flick from Inigo Martinez header was going in, but a sliding Raphinha made absolutely sure. The relief when a VAR check showed he was just onside was palpable.\nRaphinha then served up an assist for Barca’s second. A great piece of play saw Lamine Yamal float a ball in to the Brazilian to head across goal for Lewandowski to nod home.\nAnd there was still time for another one on the break again. Raphinha bent in an inviting ball for Yamal to poke home and truly finish off Dortmund.\nIt was the sort of performance that the Brazilian really needed and highlighted once again how in Raphinha, Lewandowski and Yamal - Barcelona look to have comfortably the best attack in Europe.\nFlick & Lewandowski continue perfect Dortmund record\nRobert Lewandowski came up against his former team again on Wednesday and once more made it a tough night for Niko Kovac’s side.\nThe striker has now faced Dortmund 28 times in his career and has scored 29 goals in those matches. He really is inevitable against BVB.\nIt’s also worth noting he’s now on 99 goals for Barcelona. You suspect he won’t have to wait too long to hit his century for the Catalan giants.\nHis manager seems to be Dortmund’s kryptonite, too. Hansi Flick has emerged victorious every single time he’s faced BVB as a boss and did it again on Wednesday night.\nAt a time when fixtures are coming thick and fast, and Barca were disappointed and frustrated last time out, Flick roused his side once again to keep their treble hopes alive and the team unbeaten in 2025.\n“Dreaming is allowed” said a smiling Flick after seeing his team book a Copa del Rey final spot by beating Atletico last week. There will be more sweet dreams tonight after Barca absolutely destroyed Dortmund.",
