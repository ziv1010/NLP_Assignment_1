A win in this fixture could prove to be the turning point of their season.\nMan City have the edge when it comes to this fixture but it is always difficult to predict how a derby will be played considering the pressure of the match and what is at stake.\nMan United boss Amorim is tempted to start Mason Mount for the Manchester derby.\nA report of from GiveMeSport has claimed:\n“Sources have suggested to GIVEMESPORT that Mason Mount continues to impress the boss and that the £55m star is going to be in contention for a start at the Etihad Stadium this weekend,” the outlet claims.\n“Mason Mount completed 10 passes and registered two shots on target after coming on as a substitute in Manchester United’s win at Viktoria Plzen on Thursday.”\nMason Mount’s performances have impressed Man United boss\nIt is going to be a surprising decision from the manager considering Mount has not played much football recently but he has shown signs of improvement whenever he has been given the opportunity to play.\nThe place of Marcus Rashford, who has been criticised by Alan Shearer, in the team for the derby is under threat. The likes of Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes will be a part of the midfield against Guardiola’s side.\nAmorim knows how to beat Guardiola and he showed that in the Champions League this season when he was still the manager of Sporting.\nThe Portuguese manager beat Man City 4-1 before taking charge of their Premier League rivals.",
