  "body_text": "4 takeaways from Europe: Joao Felix scores against Atletico, Real Madrid continue to roll without Bellingham & more\n- Real Madrid beat Osasuna 4-2 thanks to Brahim Diaz's form\n- Joao Felix once again came back to haunt Atletico Madrid\n- Juventus continued to struggle in Serie A\nIn many ways, the latest gameweek of European action was a rather predictable one.\nJoao Felix predictably scored against Atletico Madrid, Harry Kane predictably broke another goalscoring record in the Bundesliga, and Juventus predictably failed to score at all.\nHere's all the biggest takeaways from the weekend's action.\nJoao Felix comes back to haunt Atletico Madrid (again)\nJoao Felix has scored a measly six La Liga goals for Barcelona since his loan move from Atletico Madrid in the summer, and as the laws of football dictate, obviously two of those have come in his two games against his parent club.\nThe wide forward seemingly has a point to prove every time he faces Atleti and got on the scoresheet in Sunday's 3-0 win. It's just a pity for Barca that they don't play the capital club every weekend, as Felix might actually be worth keeping hold of if they did.\nHarry Kane breaks another record\nSilverware may allude Harry Kane once again this season, but goalscoring records won't.\nThe England superstar achieved yet another remarkable goalscoring feat over the weekend, breaking a Uwe Seeler record which stood since 1964 for the most goals scored in a debut Bundesliga campaign.\nFor all the memes and jokes, no one can honestly say it's Kane's fault Bayern aren't top of the Bundesliga right now.\nJuventus endure historically bad run of form\nJuventus fans, do you remember when Luigi Delneri was the club's manager? And how soul-destroyingly awful Juve were under his guidance? And how, under Delneri, Juve once went on a run in which they picked up just seven points from eight games in Serie A?\nWell, that's exactly how bad Juve are right now under Max Allegri.\nFor the first time in 13 years, La Vecchia Signora managed to garner a measly seven points from a run of eight league games, winning just once in that stretch.\nIt's all very, very bad in Turin right now.\nNo Jude Bellingham, no problem for Real Madrid\nNot many teams could lose their star attacking player for two games and still manage to score eight goals in the space of two weeks.\nReal Madrid are one of the teams capable of doing this.\nThanks to the wonderful form of 'deputy-Jude Bellingham' Brahim Diaz, Los Blancos have continued to roll in recent weeks, beating Celta Vigo 4-0 and then Osasuna 4-2.\nThey're one of the favourites to win the UEFA Champions League this year for a very good reason.",
