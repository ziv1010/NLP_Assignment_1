No matter what decision I take, I will always show my respect to the country,\" he said.\nYet it is interesting that many of those publications and journalists expressing disquiet over the appointment of Tuchel were more than happy to court Catalan coach, Pep Guardiola.\nThe very same Telegraph writer even suggested that the FA should \"shoot for the stars\" to entice Guardiola away from Manchester City just a couple of days before the move for Tuchel was made public.\nThe double-standard is mind-bending, although perhaps Philip II's 16th-century Spanish Armada is just about far enough in the past to forgive and forget.\nHowever, one wonders if there had been as much outrage had Guardiola taken the job and refused to sing an anthem that justifiably means nothing to him.\nThe quest for a second World Cup\nAll that being said, there is a case to say that, if international football is to exist at all, then perhaps the management team should be limited to the best of what that nation can produce as well as the players.\nIn an era of growing, concerning ultra-nationalism around the world, accelerated in England by the divisive Brexit vote, arguably the one place where a celebration of nations should be encouraged is the sporting arena.\nA lack of suitable home-grown coaches could be considered a failure in a fundamental aspect of the game.\nThis should not be news to England football fans. Famously, the last English manager to win the English top flight was Howard Wilkinson in the 1991/92 season with Leeds United.\nScotland's Sir Alex Ferguson was the last British-born manager to win the title, with Manchester United in 2012/13.\nSimilarly, Harry Rednapp was the last English FA Cup winner (Portsmouth in 2008) and Steve McClaren the most recent to win the League Cup (Middlesbrough in 2004).\nHigh quality managers are far from plentiful.\nAdditionally, there is the fact that no foreign-born coach has ever led a country to World Cup glory — in the men's or women's game.\nTwo-time World Cup winning coach Jill Ellis was born in England, but is a naturalised US citizen.\nThat being said, of the top 10 teams in the men's FIFA rankings, four now have foreign coaches.\nIt is noticeable, however, that the discourse was not repeated when Dutch coach Sarina Wiegman was handed the reigns of England's women's team, leading the Lionesses to the 2023 World Cup final.\nThe last time a European Championship winning team had a foreign coach was Greece in 2004. Incidentally, they were led by a German, Otto Rehhagel.\nTuchel has signed an 18-month contract starting on January 1, taking him up to the 2026 World Cup in North and Central America.\nUnder Southgate, England reached a World Cup semifinal and two European Championship finals, making him arguably England's best ever.\nThey even ended a 55-year major tournament losing streak against Germany under Southgate, with a 2-0 win at Wembley in Euro 2020.\nTuchel said his only aim is to add a second World Cup to England's threadbare international trophy cabinet.\n\"I understood very quickly that it's a big job,\" Tuchel said.\n\"Once I made a time frame up in my mind from January to the World Cup, I felt already excited that it suited my passion, to strive to push this group of players.\n\"To be part of this federation with such a strong record in the last tournaments to push it over the line and to try to put a second star [for winning the World Cup] on the shirt.\"\n'What a tribute to Tuchel'\nThe comments in Germany were far more lighthearted. Bild's editor Matthias Brügelmann poked fun at how England needed a German to teach them how to win again.\n\"Since 1966 – since 1966!!!! – the proud football nation has been waiting for a title,\" he wrote, referencing England's World Cup final victory over West Germany at Wembley.\n\"So it will soon be 60 years without a title. In that time we have become world champions three times and European champions three times. Oops.\n\"The desperation on the island must be enormous if they admit that only a German can help now.\n\"What a tribute to Tuchel and German football that the English are overcoming their fears despite the huge rivalry.\"\nIt's a tribute that Tuchel has deserved.\nThe 51-year-old is a serial winner as a manager, claiming 11 major trophies in his career; including two Ligue 1 titles with Paris Saint-Germain, a Bundesliga title with Bayern Munich and the Champions League with Chelsea.\nHis tactical acuity is praised by pundits and peers alike, with an innovative approach to training and an attention to detail that gets the best out of talented players while developing a steadfast defensive resolve.\nGranted, his abrasive interpersonal skills have been criticised, but that may be less of an issue away from the day-to-day pressure cooker environment of club management.\nIn small doses, Tuchel's approach might be just what England needs to take the next step from the platform Southgate has laid.\nBut if the predictable reaction to his appointment is anything to go by, there will be little room for error afforded to England's first German coach.\nBut if things go well, perhaps The Sun's headline will be prophetic. Finally: \"Fußball kommt nach Hause\".",
