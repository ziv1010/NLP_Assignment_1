  "body_text": "Man Utd misery mounts and female referee makes PL history\nLONDON: Manchester United crashed to a dismal 2-0 defeat at West Ham on Saturday that piled pressure on under-fire boss Erik ten Hag, while Rebecca Welch became the first woman to referee a Premier League match when Fulham met Burnley.\nWhile United´s misery and Welch´s historic milestone took the early spotlight on the last Premier League weekend before Christmas, there was a festive cracker in store later on Saturday when leaders Arsenal travelled to third-placed Liverpool.\nTen Hag´s United side were blown away by West Ham´s late strikes from Jarrod Bowen and Mohammed Kudus at the London Stadium, condemning them to an eighth Premier League loss already this season.\nUnited, languishing in eighth place, have managed just one win in seven games in all competitions. They have lost three of their last four matches and failed to score in any of them for the first time since 1992.\nIt has been a wretched second season for Ten Hag, whose team have been eliminated from Europe after finishing bottom of their Champions League group, while also crashing out of the League Cup.\nUnited have lost 13 games in all competitions this season -- their most defeats before Christmas since 1930-31 when they finished bottom of the table.\n“In 2023, we won a Cup, we played the FA Cup final, we were third in the league. There were highlights but we are over-performing, but in this moment we are underperforming,” Ten Hag said.\n“We have to be calm, stick together, stick to the plan, we have to do it together.” At Craven Cottage, Welch, a 40-year-old from northeast England, enjoyed a breakthrough moment for female officials in Burnley´s 2-0 win over Fulham.\nIn 2021, she became the first woman appointed to referee a match in the English Football League when she took charge of the fourth-tier fixture between Harrogate and Port Vale. Last month, Welch became the first woman to act as fourth official in a Premier League game as part of the officiating team for Fulham´s match against Manchester United.\nIt was an impressive debut for Welch, who ignored boos from the Fulham fans when she booked Calvin Bassey after his arm caught Josh Brownhill. Wilson Odobert´s 47th minute opener for Burnley needed no intervention from Welch and her assistants, with Sander Berge´s 66th minute goal sealing just the third win this season for the second-bottom Clarets.\nTottenham moved up to fourth place, three points behind Arsenal, after a 2-1 win against Everton in north London. Richarlison put Tottenham ahead against his former club in the ninth minute, slotting home from Brennan Johnson´s low cross to make it three goals in his last four games.\nSon Heung-min doubled the lead in the 18th minute with a powerful finish after Everton keeper Jordan Pickford could only parry Johnson´s shot into the South Korean´s path.\nAndre Gomes blasted into the far corner to reduce the deficit in the 82nd minute, but it was too late to stop Everton´s first defeat in five league games.\n-\nKate Middleton Proves She's True 'children's Princess' With THIS Move\n-\nPaul Anka Reveals How He Raised Son Ethan Differently From His Daughters\n-\n'A Very Special Visitor' Meets Queen Camilla At Clarence House\n-\nJodie Turner Smith Shares One Strict Rule She Follows As A Mom\n-\nHailey Bieber Reveals KEY To Balancing Motherhood With Career\n-\nPhoto Of Jay-Z, Other Prominent Figures With Jeffrey Epstein Proven To Be Fake\n-\nHillary Clinton's Munich Train Video Sparks Conspiracy Theories\n-\nFans Slam Talk Show Host For 'cringe' Behavior In Chris Hemsworth Interview\n-\nWoman Jailed Over False 'crime In Space' Claim Against NASA Astronaut\n-\nJames Van Der Beek’s Close Pal Reveals Family's Dire Need Of Donations\n-\nPrince William And Harry's Cousins Attend 'Wuthering Heights' Event\n-\nHailey Bieber Turns Heads Just Hours After Major Business Win\n-\nKing Charles' Andrew Decision Labelled 'long Overdue'\n-\nTimothee Chalamet 'forever Indebted' To Fan Over Kind Gesture\n-\nColumbia University Sacks Staff Over Epstein Partner's ‘backdoor’ Admission\n-\nOzzy Osbourne's Family Struggles Behind Closed Doors",
