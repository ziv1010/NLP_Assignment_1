Players, management, fans, we all were in it together and produced something that made me grateful to be there.\nIt’s Eddie’s and the players way to go for the win in injury time, even with 10 men, Liverpool were the ones in retreat but we got done again by them at home and they celebrated the goal like they had won the Champions League!\nWe are mixing it up with the so called ‘top’ clubs and they don’t like it, but bring it on.\nThank you Newcastle for a truly amazing evening, we didn’t deserve to lose but we move forward with hope of an amazing season to come.’\nGToon:\n‘The usual result. We have to have a man sent off, they have to hit the post at least once and the ball goes in.\nGutted for the lads.\nThey gave it everything and were the better team by far.\nLet’s not forget why Gordon was playing up front. Hopefully that isn’t lost on our owners if the rats come back with another “offer”.\nBruno was absolutely superb. Beyond words.\nBut you always thought 11 minutes was a long time for 10 men and so it proved.\nFinal point. Ramsdale please. When a player shapes his whole body to shoot into the corner, you expect the keeper to dive to that corner, not stand still. Again Pope stood still for their first. Shots go in but make an attempt please.\nLet’s hope Joelinton and Sandro aren’t too badly injured too.’\nBilly Miller:\n‘Incredible performance with the odds stacked against us.\nThat’s two games that we’ve been the better team by far and we’ve only got one point to show for it.\nSomething that is clear is the players we have are quality and determined and play with pride and passion.\nWe’ll have a good season.\nReally happy Osula got a goal.\nDevastating that it didn’t earn us a point.\nAnybody able to explain where 11 minutes came from?\nThe moment the board went up I said that we’d concede in the 100th minute and of course we did.\nLet’s hope the injuries aren’t too bad and we get at least one striker in before the window closes.’\nMatt Busby said…:\n‘At half time I’m thinking, “game over”.\nAfter Etitike’s goal, I’m thinking, ‘we’re dead’.\nThen, to a man, everyone in a black and white shirt that knows what a privilege it is to play at St James Park, stepped up.\nThe fact we lost after those lads gave everything is absolutely galling.’\nTony Mallabar:\n‘After that kick in the toon halls from luckypool. For one, I’d personally drive Isak to sunlun so he can sign for them, only stopping to pick up portions of cheesey chips and washed down with a flagon of blue panda pop.\nBack to the game, we should have been 4-0 before luckypool scored.\nIdiot Gordon getting sent off, but to come back to a Desmond then lose, is gut wrenching.\nBut that’s what good teams do to you.’\nDavid Punton:\n‘A quite astonishing opening night at St James’ Park and straight away the ‘cruel game’ cliche comes out of the almanac.\nThat was so harsh.\nThere was just too much added time to see it out with ten men after a stirring comeback.\nA 16 year old stealing the headlines with that 100th minute winner. Why so much added time these days? That was 2-2 all ends up.\nWe are left the counting the cost too.\nInjuries to Tonali and Joelinton marred the game and we really need to talk about Anthony Gordon.\nIt’s a big season for AG, and he’s blotted his copybook from the get go. That red card was so costly and silly. He’s got to cut this out of his game.\nWe can be proud of the way the players reacted for sure, but that’s now ten years since we have beaten Liverpool at St James’ Park.\nI reckon the fixture computer has given us a hard start to the season and the message to the board remains clear – a striker has to come in before the deadline.’\nNewcastle 2 Liverpool 3 – Monday 25 August 2025 8pm\n(Stats via BBC Sport)\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nGordon red card 45+3, Bruno 57, Osula 88\nLiverpool\nGravenberch 35, Ekitike 46, Nugumoha 90+10\nPossession was Newcastle 38% Liverpool 62%\nTotal shots were Newcastle 10 Liverpool 5\nShots on target were Newcastle 3 Liverpool 4\nCorners were Newcastle 7 Liverpool 1\nTouches in the box Newcastle 27 Liverpool 15\nNewcastle team v Liverpool:\nPope, Trippier (Hall 76), Schar (Thiaw 81), Burn, Livramento, Joelinton (Ramsey 76), Tonali (Miley 66), Bruno, Barnes (Osula 76), Gordon, Elanga\nUnused subs:\nRamsdale, Botman, Jacob Murphy, Willock\n(Football can be a cruel game – Newcastle 2 Liverpool 3 – Read HERE)\nNewcastle United upcoming match schedule:\nSaturday 30 August – Leeds v Newcastle (5.30pm) Sky Sports\nSaturday 13 September – Newcastle v Wolves (3pm)\nSaturday 20 September – Bournemouth v Newcastle (3pm)\nSunday 28 September– Newcastle v Arsenal (4.30pm) Sky Sports\nSunday 5 October– Newcastle v Forest (2pm) Sky Sports\nSaturday 18 October – Brighton v Newcastle (3pm)\nSaturday 25 October– Newcastle v Fulham (3pm)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
