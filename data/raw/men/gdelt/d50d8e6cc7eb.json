Burnley - 1 point\nAt the very bottom of the pile are Burnley. The Clarets have been behind 21 times and are yet to find a solution.\nVincent Kompany's side have mustered just one draw after falling behind, that coming when David Datro Fofana scored twice to salvage a draw against Fulham in February.\n19. Sheffield United - 3 points\nSheffield United have been behind more than anyone else this season, suffering an incredible 23 deficits.\nGiven how poor they have been, the Blades have unsurprisingly failed to win a single game when falling behind. However, they have managed three draws.\nThey were behind twice against West Ham in January and rescued a 2-2 draw, struck an equaliser to claim a point at Brighton in November and were behind when they drew 2-2 with Everton in September.\n18. Everton - 3 points\nFalling behind 15 times, Everton's real trouble with scoring goals - being the third-lowest scorers - means they've rarely gone ahead in the Premier League this season.\nSean Dyche's side are yet to win a game from a losing position, claiming three points from three draws.\n17. Newcastle - 3 points\nNewcastle's squad depth has been near non-existent this season due to injuries. Unsurprisingly, that has affected results on the pitch after qualifying for the Champions League last term.\nThe Magpies are another side yet to win from a losing position, going behind on 14 occasions.\nManager Eddie Howe has been unable to impact games on the touchline when his side go behind due to the lack of options at his disposal.\n16. Fulham - 5 points\nFulham have been in their own world for a lot of the season and have fallen behind 15 times, winning just once and drawing twice.\nThe comeback win was a good one, though, as they overturned a 1-0 deficit against Arsenal to triumph 2-1 at Craven Cottage in December.\n15. Nottingham Forest - 6 points\nStrugglers Nottingham Forest have been behind 19 times this season and have only managed to win once, drawing three times.\nThe victory was away at Newcastle, where Chris Wood bagged a hat-trick against his former side and secured a 3-1 win.\n14. Luton Town - 7 points\nThe joint-second-most any team has been behind this season is 21. Luton Town are one of those teams and while they have only secured victory from the jaws of defeat once, the Hatters have also scooped four draws.\nThe win arrived when they were 2-1 down away at Sheffield United in December until the 77th minute, before the Blades scored two own goals and it ended 3-2.\n13. Bournemouth - 8 points\nBournemouth have been behind 15 times this season and managed to get a couple of wins from it.\nAndoni Iraola's side went 1-0 down away at Forest but eventually won 3-2 thanks to Dominic Solanke's 94th-minute strike.\nThey also beat Burnley 2-1 at home after going behind in the 11th minute.\n12. Arsenal - 8 points\nIt's a surprise to see title challengers Arsenal all the way down in 12th, but the plain truth is the Gunners haven't had to rescue victories all that often. They have only been behind eight times, the least of any club and four times fewer than Liverpool, Man City and Aston Villa.\nTwo occasions have been turned into wins and two have ended in draws alongside four defeats. They found themselves 3-2 down at Luton in December but won 4-3, courtesy of a 97th-minute Declan Rice goal.\nThe north London giants were also briefly 1-0 down at home to Man Utd at the start of the season but ended up win the game 3-1 with the last two goals coming in stoppage time. Rice got the winner that day too, before Gabriel Jesus added some gloss.\n11. Brentford - 9 points\nBrentford have had to deal with their fair share of injuries this season but haven't helped themselves on the pitch, starting slowly and falling behind a whopping 20 times.\nOnly three teams have been behind more often than the Bees - no prizes for guessing who.\nThat said, Thomas Frank's have still snared two wins and three draws from losing positions. The victories came against Forest in January and West Ham in November, both of which were 3-2 successes where they came back from a one-goal deficit.\n10. Crystal Palace - 9 points\nCrystal Palace are another side not adverse to going behind fairly often. It's just the 18 occasions that they have conceded the first goal.\nHowever, the Eagles have shown resilience throughout 2023/24, managing two wins from losing positions. They were behind twice at Selhurst Park against Sheffield United but won 3-2.\nThey also came from behind to beat Brentford 3-1 in December and have secured three draws when up against it.\n9. Man Utd - 9 points\nMan Utd are traditionally associated with comebacks and never knowing when they are beaten, but a flat campaign means there has been less of that than usual.\nHaving been behind 14 times, only three matches have been rescued into victories and none have been turned into draws.\nTheir best comeback victory this season was at home to Aston Villa on Boxing Day. Man Utd scored three times in the second half to win 3-2, with Rasmus Hojlund getting his Premier League goal. The 2-1 success at Old Trafford against Brentford was dramatic too, with Scott McTominay scoring in the 93rd and 97th minutes to win 2-1.\nThe third and final triumph came when Erik ten Hag's side went 2-0 down at at home against Forest, eventually getting out of jail with a 3-2 victory.\n8. Wolves - 11 points\nGary O'Neil's Wolves have trailed their opponents on 16 occasions this season, turning three into wins and two into draws.\nThe Wanderers beat Bournemouth 2-1 after Solanke had scored first, defeated Tottenham 2-1 with goals in the 91st and 97th minutes and went behind against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge before winning 4-2.\nIt may only be three wins, but they've beaten two big sides after falling behind, showing some impressive character in the process.\n7. Chelsea - 12 points\nMentality has been a problem for Mauricio Pochettino's Chelsea this season, but there have been times when they've shown some steel.\nThe Blues have gone behind a massive 16 times but have turned three losing positions into victories and another three into draws.\nChelsea were 1-0 down before beating Burnley 4-1 in October and performed a similar trick in the crazy game away at Tottenham in which the home side had two players sent off.\nHaving fallen behind the Crystal Palace, Pochettino's snatched a 3-1 comeback win where it was 1-1 until the 91st minute.\n6. Aston Villa - 12 points\nUnai Emery makes his teams hard to beat and Aston Villa's 12 points from losing positions shows that.\nThe Villans have only been behind 12 times, the same as Liverpool and Man City, picking up three wins from after conceding first. The first and most dramatic match was in September, when Villa were 1-0 down at home to Palace until Jhon Duran netted in the 87th minute. Goals in injury time then made it 3-1.\nVilla also came from behind to beat Tottenham 2-1 in November and did the same away at Brentford in December.\n5. Brighton - 14 points\nBrighton know how it feels to fall behind this season, having done so on 16 occasions.\nThe Seagulls have turned three of those poor starts into wins, however, and another five into draws. They've drawn more games than anyone else all season with nine overall.\nBrighton's first comeback win came at the AMEX against Bournemouth in September, succeeding 3-1 after Solanke opened the scoring. They beat Forest 3-2 in November after being 1-0 down and defeated Brentford 2-1 in December, when Bryan Mbeumo netted first.\n4. West Ham - 14 points\nThe 2023/24 season has been an odd one for West Ham. The vibe has been predominantly negative but they have a genuine shot of qualifying for Europe again and remain in the Europa League.\nHammers fans might start feeling happier if their side stops conceding first, although they tend to make a decent fist of getting out of the holes they find themselves in. They have won four games and drawn another two from the 15 times they have fallen behind this season.\nWest Ham's most recent Premier League win was away at Everton, triumphing 3-1 after Beto had put the Toffees ahead. A tighter comeback came against Forest in November, eventually winning 3-2 having gone 2-1 behind.\nGoals in 86th and 91st minutes helped David Moyes' side to a 2-1 win at Burnley, while two second-half strikes secured a memorable 2-1 victory at Tottenham.\n3. Tottenham - 19 points\nTottenham have had a wonderful aura of chaos under Ange Postecoglou this season and that often manifests itself in comebacks.\nSpurs have been behind 15 times this season but turned five into wins and four into draws. The most emphatic was early on at Burnley, where they went behind after four minutes but were 5-1 up by the 66th minute, eventually winning 5-2 as Son Heung-min bagged a hat-trick.\nThe north Londoners came from behind to beat Brentford 3-2 in January and turned things around in north London against Brighton with a 96th-minute Brennan Johnson winner in February.\nSimilarly, they beat Crystal Palace 3-1 at the start of March after being 1-0 down until the 77th minute following Eberechi Eze's stunning free-kick.\n2. Man City - 21 points\nIf at all possible, it's best not to disturb a snoozing behemoth like Man City, as things can get ugly. Man Utd found that out in the most recent derby, losing 3-1 despite taking an early lead.\nPep Guardiola's reigning champions have won six games from losing positions this season, the first of which came in their fourth match when West Ham took the lead before conceding three goals. Luton Town, Everton, Newcastle and Brentford have also been victims.\nWhen a team has the sort of firepower City boast, it's advisable not to take the lead until at least the 98th minute.\n1. Liverpool - 22 points\nIf Liverpool do manage to win the Premier League this season, their late comebacks will end up proving pivotal.\nJurgen Klopp's side have been behind 12 times this season but only lost twice. They have won on six of the occasions they have fallen behind and drawn another four.\nThe Reds got a taste for it early, falling behind after three minutes against Bournemouth in their second game of the season before winning 3-1.\nThat continued in the next match, coming from behind to beat Newcastle 2-1 despite Virgil van Dijk's early red card. Three of their first five Premier League fixtures this season were comeback wins.\nThere have been some very dramatic results that will live long in the memory, including the 4-3 win over Fulham which was powered by goals in the 87th and 88th minutes.",
