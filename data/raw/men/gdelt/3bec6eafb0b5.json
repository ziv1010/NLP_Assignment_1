We definitely enjoy the atmosphere. We have to deal with that,” he said.\n“There is no ‘almost there’. There are 10 more games to go for us and nothing is decided yet. Until it gets decided we don’t get carried away whatsoever.\n“I’m going to be the boring guy in that sense because I’m going to say ‘onto the next, keep calm’.\n“You have to enjoy winning games but not for too long as you play almost every three days.\n“We have put ourselves in a very good position but it doesn’t mean that anything is done, I keep reminding players and also the outside world – you guys in the media – that there is no time and space for complacency.\n“The message (before Newcastle) was we had to show what we are all about because after a very good win against Man City to drop points or have a bad performance (would mean) the performance against City doesn’t stand for anything.”\nLiverpool have come through a testing 15-day phase to take 11 points from matches against Everton, Wolves, Aston Villa, Manchester City and Newcastle and in all that time they have only been behind for 21 minutes.\nWhen they last won the title in 2020 they were 22 points clear of Manchester City, who had a match in hand, at this stage and would have set a new record for the earliest securing of the trophy had Covid not interrupted the season for three months.\nIn the end they won it with seven matches of the campaign still left.\nThey have only one league match in March but should they continue to have a 13-point lead they would win the title with four games to spare, at home to Tottenham on April 26, although if they were to win their next three and Arsenal lost four in a row that would be brought forward to the first week of April.\nThe earliest date a title has been won by was April 14 when Manchester United were crowned champions in 2001.\nBut March will be dominated by a Champions League last-16 tie against Paris St Germain and the Carabao Cup final, where they will face Newcastle again.\n“A final is always different and we are very wary of the threat they possess,” said Van Dijk.\n“We know that Alexander Isak (who missed the Anfield defeat with injury) is definitely the most in-form striker at the moment in world football so you know when he’s back, that will give them a boost.\n“Now we can switch off our minds for a day at least and then focus on getting in best shape again.”",
