Calendar has a nifty little reminder feature that will send a message to your phone, instant messenger or email address a given time period before an event.\nThanks to Catholic school, I can still conjugate certain Latin verbs by heart. But remembering my brother's birthday? Always a challenge. But with a Yahoo! membership, go to the calendar, enter a yearly recurring event, and set up a reminder.\nThat way, when Mom's birthday rolls around, I know I'll get extra brownie points (and hopefully extra meatballs) for being the first of all my siblings to give her a call.\nYahoo!
