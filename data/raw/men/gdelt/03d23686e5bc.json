Over the years, current and former Everton and Liverpool players have been spotted in numerous hospitality venues, from local pubs and small cafés to prestigious restaurants, bars and takeaways.\nWith the teams attracting star players from across the globe, many of our favourite sporting stars seek out Liverpool's very many international restaurants and cafes to enjoy the cuisine they are missing from home.\nTo celebrate our city's great social scene we’ve decided to compile a list some of the places our famous sports stars have visited over the years. This list is not exhaustive so if we’ve missed any that are popular destinations for football stars, please let us know in the comments below.\nSan Carlo\nThe Castle Street restaurant opened in the city back in 2009 and has been a top choice for players over the years. During his stint with the reds Mario Balotelli dined there with friends. Former Everton star James Rodriguez was spotted there too in recent years as have current Liverpool players Harvey Elliott and Kostas Tskimkas and the club's all-time top goal scorer Ian Rush.\nLucy In The Sky\nLucy in the Sky, based on Exchange Street East, is known for hosting footballers. Gini Wijnaldum frequently visited the cafe when he was playing for Liverpool FC. Wayne Rooney and Robbie Fowler have also been pictured in the venue which is named after the famous Beatles song.\nMeet Argentinian Restaurant in The Bentley\nFootball stars are known to enjoy a meaty meal in Meet Argentinian restaurant in The Bentley building, located on Brunswick Street, just off The Strand. In previous years, Liverpool stars celebrated the birthday of former striker Roberto Firmino's wife, Larissa Pereira there and former Everton forward Richarlison was also spotted at the party in the Bentley venue. Former Evertonians Kevin Mirallas and Joel Robles visited during their time at Goodison too.\nNeighbourhood\nThe venue famed for show stopping parties, food, cocktails and A-list events, opened back in 2016 in Castle Street and has welcomed a host of famous faces over the years. Michael Keane and Roberto Firmino have been spotted there, as well as Coleen Rooney and Alex Gerrard.\nBacaro\nShortly after being unveiled as Liverpool manager, Arne Slot also visited Castle Street. The Dutchman opted to visit Bacaro in July 2024, an Italian-influenced restaurant which offers small plates, cocktails and outdoor seating.\nHawksmoor\nOne of Jurgen Klopp’s most famous sightings in Liverpool came just hours before he bid a final goodbye to his supporters. He booked out a private room at Hawksmoor, in Brunswick Street, a few hours before ‘An Evening with Jurgen Klopp’, held at the M&S Bank Arena, on Tuesday, May 28. Klopp posed for a picture with a family of Liverpool supporters at the prestigious steak restaurant.\nMacello's Meathouse\nSouth American meat restaurant Macello classes footballers such as Liverpool's Alisson Becker and Virgil Van Dijk among its regular customers. Macello opened back in December 2017 promising to offer diners the highest quality and biggest selection of meat, cooked to perfection.\nThe restaurant, on Childwall Abbey Road, has filled its Instagram feed with delicious-looking dishes and a glimpse of the famous faces which walk through its doors. Former Liverpool footballers Roberto Firmino, Fabinho, Sadio Mane and Dejan Lovren have visited Macello too.\nKassap Meat House\nKassap Meat House opened at the start of 2019 inside the former Dia + Noche and Miyagi site on Bold Street. It was opened by the same team behind Macello.\nKassap’s specialities include the harbin steak, made with creamy Asian spices, and the Kassap steak which is served with tomatoes and a demi-glace sauce. Alisson Becker has visited before, along with his former teammates Roberto Firmino and Fabinho.\nBakchich\nOne customer who kept coming back to Bakchich on Bold Street was none other than Liverpool forward Mo Salah. Owner Adam Outaaraft told the ECHO last year: “Mo Salah and his wife used to come in here and then when he started to become more famous, he ordered takeaways and his wife would come and collect them as she’s obviously not as well-known.\"\nThe Bagelry\nCurrent Liverpool players Dominik Szoboszlai, Ryan Gravenberch and Ibrahima Konate donned their aprons in a competition for the best doughnut and bagel at The Bagelry in Chinatown in 2023. The players cooked and gave away free donuts and bagels to help promote the small business.\nHomebaked\nThe cooperative bakery on Oakfield Road is a stone’s throw from Anfield and has attracted numerous big names over the years. Robbie Fowler has visited the bakery while Curtis Jones surprised a young Liverpool fan last year while he was working behind the counter.\nIl Forno\nDuke Street's Italian restaurant Il Forno marked its relaunch in 2020 by inviting some top names from across the city including then Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti and former striker Duncan Ferguson. The Italian enjoyed the Duke Street restaurant so much during his time in Merseyside that he used to come in regularly via a separate entrance to avoid being spotted by the public.\nLark Lane\nEx-Everton manager Sean Dyche and his assistant Ian Woan, who is from Wirral, were frequent visitors to the bars and restaurants of Lark Lane, in Aigburth, during their time in the dugout at Goodison Park.\nIn an interview last year, Woan said it was hard to visit the bustling south Liverpool street without Dyche being recognised. He said: “At Burnley, he never got bothered really, whereas Everton are global so, for instance, it’s difficult to show him the delights of Lark Lane. The apartment isn’t far from there, but if you’ve got a 6ft 2in ginger skinhead who talks like he talks, you can’t just put him in a corner and tell him to keep his head down.\n“But we’ve been to Hafla Hafla (a restaurant serving food from the Middle East), Love and Rockets, Blondies bar where they have a live singer on… He’d like to go there more often because he likes his music and something a bit more eclectic.”\nSpitroast\nLiverpool’s very own Spitroast is another restaurant that’s known to attract football players. The independent chicken venue has two branches in Merseyside, one in Crosby and another on Smithdown Road. Spitroast has rave reviews and is hailed by many as \"better than Nandos\" so it’s not surprising that the likes of Jamie Carragher go for their tea.\nSixty Kitchen\nSixty Kitchen opened in June 2023 with a few unique quirks that have remained to this day. It has a set menu which changes every month. The process to get Chinese food to a customer's doors is entirely in-house, rather than utilising third-party services, with its own app and delivery drivers.\nIt soon proved popular, with Jamie Carragher sharing his praise for the venue on his Instagram story. Recently, it was voted as Merseyside’s best Chinese takeaway in a poll of ECHO readers.\nThe Freshfield Pub\nFor Jurgen Klopp, The Freshfield Pub was one of his most visited venues when he lived in Formby. Shortly before the 2022 Champions League final, fans spotted him having a drink with anotherformer resident and Liverpool FC legend Steven Gerrard.",
