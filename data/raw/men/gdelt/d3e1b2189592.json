We understand that Chelsea are open to offloading Mudryk in January, with sources describing an exit as “very possible.”\nThere is interest in Mudryk from the Premier League and around Europe. Bayern Munich, for example, pushed to sign him on loan in January this year.\nBayern are still looking at Mudryk but their interest has cooled now that Thomas Tuchel has left the German giants and Vincent Kompany took the reins.\nA loan move is most likely for Mudryk this winter as clubs are generally reluctant to splash out big sums mid-season.\nChelsea are unlikely to recoup the fee they paid to sign Mudryk. A successful loan spell could be the best opportunity for his valuation to rise again.\nTEAMtalk also understands that Chelsea are willing to part ways with Axel Disasi, Benoit Badiashile and Ben Chilwell in January if a suitable offer is tabled.\nChelsea want to strengthen two key areas\nChelsea are also looking to strengthen in January and reports suggest that they want to bring in a new right-back to cover for injury-plagued star Reece James.\nThe Blues have drawn up a five-man shortlist of targets for the position and big names such as Barcelona’s Jules Kounde and Bayer Leverkusen’s Jeremie Doku are being eyed.\nChelsea could also look to bring in a new striker, depending on how Nicolas Jackson, Nkunku and Joao Felix perform over the next few months.\nTheir top target for much of the summer was Napoli striker Victor Osimhen but they were unable to seal a deal despite being in talks with his representatives into the final hours of the window.\nChelsea remain interested in Osimhen and could get the opportunity to sign him in January thanks to a break clause in his loan agreement with Galatasaray.\nIN FOCUS: Mykhailo Mudryk vs Jadon Sancho 2023/24\nTT has taken a look at how Mudryk and Sancho fare in terms of their respective 2023/24 campaigns – displaying why Maresca seems to prefer the latter.\nSancho was dropped from the Manchester United first team for the first half of the season before being loaned to Borussia Dortmund in January, where he helped the German giants reach the Champions League final.\nSancho clearly has the edge in terms of chances created and dribbles completed per game, while he also keeps possession more consistently than Mudryk, with a higher pass completion rate.\nMudryk betters Sancho in terms of goals scored but he played over double the amount of matches, so you could argue that Sancho is still more dangerous in front of goal.\nFULL BREAKDOWN: The key contract details of every Chelsea first-team player: Expiry dates, weekly wages, agents…",
