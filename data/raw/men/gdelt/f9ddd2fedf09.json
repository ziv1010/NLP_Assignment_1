  "body_text": "The path to a sixth consecutive Women's Super League crown for Chelsea Women has been released. 11 home. 11 away. Three at the confines of Stamford Bridge. The Blues, who are under the tutelage of new French manager Sonia Bompastor, have so far brought in four new recruits to West London with the hopes of sustaining the on the pitch excellence post-Emma Hayes.\nThe West Londoners kick off the league campaign vs. Aston Villa, who are now led by Robert de Pauw, the former Bayer Leverkusen and FC Twente leader at Kingsmeadow on the weekend of September 20-22. It is a week earlier than the opening weekend of last season. The question always is what version of CFCW are we going to get at the beginning? The seven-time WSL champions are winless in three out of their last four matches during the campaign's first matchday, with the only win coming last season vs. Tottenham at the Bridge.\nThe league's newcomers will host Bompastor's Chelsea on September 27 before a brutal back-to-back against Manchester United and Arsenal. Revenge will be on the Blues' minds at the Emirates after getting thrashed there last December, 4-1. It is also important to note that there is a Champions League group stage contest between the United and Arsenal contests.\nChelsea has three league games in SW6 - November vs. Manchester City, January vs. Arsenal, and the last matchday of the season vs. Liverpool.\nFran Kirby will make her return vs. Chelsea in Brighton and Hove Albion colors in early December before the club plays its final WSL game prior to the winter break in Leicester.\nThere isn't a question, in our opinion, as to which match is the toughest. At Manchester City smack dab right in the middle of the two legs of the UEFA Women's Champions League quarterfinals. This is taking into consideration that this team will advance into the knockout rounds. Chelsea hasn't won at Man City since 2021, a match in which Magdalena Eriksson scored.\nThe denouement, or the finale of the season is quite an intriguing matchup. Liverpool, a side that gave the West Londoners fits more than once in the last campaign, travel to SW6 to play in front of what hopes to be a packed house.\nChelsea Women's 2024/25 Women's Super League fixtures\nNote: Exact dates and times for most of these fixtures will be announced in due course per the club.
