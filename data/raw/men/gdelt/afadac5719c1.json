Nuno Espirito Santo’s side currently sit third in the Premier League after Sunday’s home victory over Southampton and the prospect of a first campaign in Europe’s premier club competition since 1980/81 is becoming a real possibility.\nThe club would of course prosper from a place in the Champions League, or any of the other European competitions for that matter, with qualification for the Europa League or Europa Conference League also a possibility. But according to Nottingham City Council councillor Steve Battlemuch, himself a passionate Reds supporter, “a big winner would be the city itself”.\nHe said: “I don’t want to jinx anything by making an assumption of where we will finish this season, however, we can legitimately start to dream and dust off our passports for midweek trips across Europe. Playing the likes of Barcelona and Bayern Munich on a regular basis beats playing Stoke and Derby doesn’t it?\n“Imagine thousands of fans coming to Nottingham for 2/3 days at a time. The hotel and hospitality industry would get a massive boost. The increased scrutiny from the media, especially the football media outside the UK, would put a spotlight onto the city which will benefit tourism outside of the obvious football connection.”\nThe financial implications of Champions League qualification would be significant to Forest. This season, clubs received almost £16m for qualifying for the competition, earning an additional £1.8m for every win in the league phase. Councillor Battlemuch believes the extra revenue could help redevelop the City Ground, which would create jobs and benefit fans.\nHe added: “It would be the catalyst for the stadium redevelopment we are all desperate to see at the City Ground. We certainly need the extra capacity already to accommodate everyone who wants to come, this demand will only increase if we add European games to the schedule. Imagine an expanded City Ground holding 45,000 fans, it’s got to be a good thing.”\nChampions League qualification would see Forest play a minimum of eight European games next season, four of which would be played at the City Ground and those extra clashes would provide local pubs with opportunities to boost their revenue.\nBoot Room owner, Mark James, whose pub is situated straight across from the City Ground, said: “Europe would be great, for the club, great for the city, but also, looking at myself as a business, it means at least an extra four games a season. The Forest faithful are always going to be there and it could mean I could be looking at my P&L (Profit and Loss) for the following year and thinking wow, that’s an extra 30 or 40 grand, and that’s if they just get into Europe, if they go and do well in Europe, you’ve got another two or three games after that.”\nMr James, who has been running the establishment in Pavilion Road for more than four years, added that European fans usually travel abroad for a few days when watching their team and he’s keen for the Boot Room to become a staple part of any visiting fan’s trip to Nottingham.\n“When people go and watch European football, they do a bit more planning, they make a mini break out of it,\" continued Mr James. “Let’s say Munich fans, they’re going to come a day earlier [than the game], and they’ll come to the Boot Room, have a drink, see the memorabilia and they’ll love it. It’s a pleasure for European teams to come to Nottingham, so if we can become part of their mini break, it can only be a benefit.”\nThe Reds have currently won eight out of their last nine league and cup games, the only blemish in that run a 1-1 draw with league leaders Liverpool, and Tom Holodynsky, owner of The William Gunn pub and operations manager for the Great Northern Group - owners of the Trent Navigation Inn and its big Big Shed fan zone - commented on how this season’s current success is helping drive up trade.\nMr Holodynsky said: “You do find on a match day that people do come out that little bit earlier and they do stay out that little bit longer when there’s something to be positive about on the pitch. People are talking [about Forest’s success] every other day in the pubs and on the streets and people carry that with them in their day-to-day lives and that ends up bleeding into the economy. It’s one hundred percent positive vibes.”\nForest have a rich European history having won the European Cup (the competition that became the Champions League) twice in consecutive seasons under legendary manager Brian Clough and assistant Peter Taylor in 1979 and 1980. But Nottingham City Council deputy leader Ethan Radford thinks that Champions League qualification for Forest would be an opportunity for the club to write a “new chapter” in their history.\nHe said: “The financial boost, global exposure, and enhanced civic pride would have long-lasting effects on Nottingham’s economy, culture, and community spirit. For a club steeped in history, this moment would mark the beginning of a new chapter, one that reaffirms Nottingham’s place on the global footballing map while celebrating the legacy of a club that has inspired generations.”\nCllr Radford also pointed out that Nottingham would be put on “the global stage” if the club qualified for Europe, adding: “The influx of visiting fans, media, and scouts from across Europe would provide a significant boost to the local economy, with increased spending in hotels, restaurants, and retail establishments. The presence of high-profile European teams would also raise Nottingham's profile as a city on the global stage, potentially attracting investment.”\nEast Midlands Chamber director of policy and insight Richard Blackmore also agreed that Champions League football would “provide an economic boost for Nottingham”. He said: “After an impressive season to date, to make the Champions League wouldn’t just be exciting news for Forest fans; you’d be looking at an economic boost for Nottingham. Any club that grows its presence on an international stage can grow the wider economy of a city as you get greater visitor interest.”",
