Today it is at 10 per cent.\n“I have met some people I’m familiar with at Milan and have been in touch with them.\n“It is hard emotions because they don’t happen all the time in football.\n“They are special and I’ll remember them forever.\n“This is the team I support and the team that gave me a chance to succeed.\n“Things have completely changed. I am here as a rival, I have to manage that but it won’t be a problem.”\n“I don’t know who he (Tonali’s father is an AC Milan season ticket holder) will support.\n“I don’t want to be in his head but I think he will take care of me!\n“I hope he will support me but it’s very difficult to change a supporter’s mind about their team.\n“I think he will support Milan and support me.\n“Maybe he will want a draw?\n“It will be the most thrilling feeling to come out into the stadium packed with people again.\n“They let me live my dream here at AC Milan but now I come back as a rival.\n“I will have a lot of feelings.\n“Everything happened so fast with the transfer, I was overwhelmed at first, but I have come across a wonderful team, wonderful staff and play for people who love football.\n“The people of Newcastle will help anyone.”\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
