  "body_text": "Newcastle United star Callum Wilson has spoken about the vibes in the club dressing room and revealed who brings the tunes to a matchday.\nThe number nine was among the stars taking to the red carpet ahead of the 2025 MOBO Awards which where held in Newcastle for the first time.\nWilson said the 'iconic' event was a great coup for the region.\n\"It's important that the club and the city keep spreading awareness for different events and hopefully this can follow on and we can have more events in the future.\n\"I love music,\" the forward said. \"It's part of my daily life because sometimes you have to listen to it to get in the mood to play matches.\"\nHowever, the team playlist secrets were safe as Wilson said it was a 'random' shuffle on the playlists that the squad listen to to get into the groove for a match.\nBut, the one thing he was emphatic on was that there was one person in charge of setting the vibe in the dressing room.\n\"Jacob Murphy,\" was his answer. Which perhaps is not surprising to Newcastle fans.\nMost read\n-\nEx-Big Brother star Simone Reed in court over Redcar bar incident\n-\nPopular B&B The Saxon Inn, Escomb, for sale for £525,000\n-\nSteph McGovern won £125k for Middlesbrough charity on ITV show\nAt @MOBOAwards #NUFC forward @CallumWilson tells us who brings the vibes in the dressing room.\n— Joshua Nichol (@JoshuaFNichol) February 18, 2025\nYou might have already guessed ❓ pic.twitter.com/c4u2MEQUbc\nMurphy has been in fine form throughout the season, providing vital goal contributions as the club look to go one further than their last trip to Wembley for a cup final in the coming weeks.\nAmong fans Murphy has gained a reputation for being a genuine character who loves playing football - notably his ear-to-ear smile in Milan during the club's return to the Champions League last season.\nWilson returned to the squad in recent weeks after a spell on the sidelines because of injury.
