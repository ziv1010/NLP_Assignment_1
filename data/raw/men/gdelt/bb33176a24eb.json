To add to his woes, Leicester City were relegated to the English Championship which threw his future into disarray. However, sucour seems to have come his way as his former Foxes boss, Brendan Rodgers, is set to team up with the Super Eagle at Celtic Park\nCeltic boss, Brendan Rodgers could look to reunite with his former Leicester City player, Wilfred Ndidi, making the Nigerian defensive midfielder one of his first signings in his second tenure at Celtic Park reports the Daily Mail.\nNdidi, a crucial part of Rodgers’ Leicester squad, made the switch to the King Power Stadium from Genk for £17 million back in 2018.\nAt first glance, this price tag may seem out of reach for Celtic. However, considering Ndidi has just one year remaining on his contract and Leicester’s recent relegation to the Championship, the Hoops’ pursuit of the midfielder might not be as far-fetched as it seems. Maybe Celtic could use this to their advantage as they attempt to negotiate a deal, which will be challenging, with interest from Saudi Arabia.\nThe midfielder’s wages would also be a stumbling block, reportedly on £76,000 a week, he’d need to take a massive cut and more than half his income.\nRodgers, whose return to Celtic was officially announced on Monday, has reportedly been assured a substantial transfer budget, aligning with his ambitions to make a significant impact in European competitions.\nThe 26-year-old Ndidi boasts an impressive footballing resume, with 51 caps for Nigeria and a strong youth football career in his home country before his move to Belgium at the age of 20 in 2015.\nNdidi joined Leicester City in the wake of their incredible Premier League title win, as part of their investment to attempt to maintain their top-tier status in English football.\nUnder Rodgers, Ndidi experienced considerable success, including an FA Cup win in 2021 and twice securing a fifth-place finish in the Premier League.\nIf these transfer rumours are accurate, the reunion of Rodgers and Ndidi could mark an exciting era of robust growth for the Hoops.\nBefore his injury, Ndidi was a cult hero among the King Power Stadium faithful, and to Leicester City Manager, the midfield enforcer was indispensable.\nThe Nigerian was then a sure starter and statistics proved that he was Foxes most important player for two years running.\nTo some then, it was still a miracle that Leicester City were able to hold on to their jewel in spite of inquiries from big European clubs of the former Nathaniel Boys player.\nFor several transfer windows, he was linked with a move to Old Trafford to take command of the holding midfield, an area the Red Devils was found wanting but somehow Leicester City held on the midfielder.\nNdidi had severally proven to be one of the best tacklers in Europe. In the Community Shield game against Manchester City, he rose to the occasion for Leicester City and was the boss in midfield.\nThe midfielder also increased his passing accuracy and he hardly makes mistakes when protecting his back three or back four and he gives his central midfielders the confidence to surge forward.\nAt the end of the 2021/22 season, he has had 591 tackles in 152 premier league games, 325 interceptions and 355 clearances. He has 1,291 ball recoveries and has won 1,277 duels, one of the best records in the Premier League.\nHow much value Ndidi adds to Leicester City has never been lost by former manager, Rodgers and the Irish has never stopped showering encomiums on the Nigerian describing him as irreplaceable.\n“It’s impossible to find what we have, we’ve got good players, but specifically the job Ndidi does in breaking up play and just his overall defending and in the box, he’s irreplaceable for us,” Rodgers had said.\n“He’s one of the top players in world football. His quality in his football is improving all the time. He is irreplaceable for us. He’s fantastic for a young player.\n“What is pleasing as a coach, is that he wants to learn. He will improve and get better. I’m so happy he plays in my team,” Rodgers once said.\nHowever, there are some staggering numbers behind a potential deal.\nThe new Parkhead boss may have unwittingly priced the Scottish Premiership champions out of a deal with his previous comments on the midfielder during his time as Foxes boss.\nParkhead majority shareholder, Dermot Desmond is set to hand Rodgers a bumper transfer kitty following his return to Celtic Park with the Irishman desperate to build a side capable of making a mark on the Champions League while continuing to dominate in Scotland.\nReports suggest that the 26-year-old has been viewed by Rodgers as fitting the profile of player he would like to add to his revamped squad – who has just a year left on his current Leicester contract following their relegation from the English Premier League.\nHe cost the relegated side £17million when he made the move to the King Power Stadium in 2017, but coach Enzo Maresca and the club risk the player leaving for nothing in January if they don’t sell this summer.\nHowever, Celtic could be forced to pay a bumper fee to seal a deal – if Rodgers’ own valuation is anything to go by. With the transfer window approaching, speculation was surrounding the midfield enforcer and a potential move to either Aston Villa or Manchester United – with Villa reportedly weighing up a £50million move for the key player. When that figure was put to Rodgers at a press conference, he quipped: “He’s worth much more than that.”\n“A player of that quality and mentality, of course you want to always keep. But when you have that player, he will always attract interest.”\nThe 26-year-old salary could be another stumbling block for any potential deal. The Leicester Mercury previously reported that Ndidi netted a staggering £75,000 per week with the club.\nIt would be a real sign of the spending power behind Rodgers on his comeback to Glasgow’s east end if a deal was to get over the line. But it will take some staggering figures to get the Nigeria international in the door.",
