My client has been dragged through the papers accused of not paying income tax which has been paid.'\nThis week, the BBC revealed that Lineker had extended his TV contract until the end of the 2026 World Cup - but is stepping down from MotD after 26 years fronting the flagship football show as it 'evolves for changing viewing habits'.\nIn a 21-word statement, which did not mention leaving MotD at all, he said: 'I'm delighted to continue my long association with BBC Sport and would like to thank all those who made this happen'.\nA day later it was announced he was also stepping down from his role as presenter of Sports Personality Of The Year.\nLineker is believed to have been 'open' to staying as MotD host and even offered to cut his £1.35million-a-year salary but the BBC declined.\nLineker's exit will close the curtain on a long - and at times controversial - chapter for one the nation's most popular sports shows.\nThe statement read: 'The BBC and Gary Lineker have agreed in principle a contract extension through to the 2026 World Cup.\n'Gary will lead the coverage of the tournament, as England once again try to land a first major trophy since 1966, the other Home Nations look to qualify and Lionel Messi aims to retain the trophy he won with Argentina.\nThis week, the BBC revealed that Lineker had extended his TV contract until the end of the 2026 World Cup - but is stepping down from MotD after 26 years fronting the flagship football show\nLineker pictured presenting for BT Sport in 2021 for the Uefa Champions League semi final second leg match between Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain\n'Gary will also host BBC Sport's coverage of the FA Cup in the 2025-26 season, 35 years on from lifting the trophy as a player.\n'After a quarter of a century, Gary is stepping down from hosting Match of The Day at the end of this season. He will continue with the MOTD Top Ten podcast and the BBC will also host the hugely popular The Rest is Football podcast on BBC Sounds.'\nLineker has, however, secured a deal with the BBC to stream his immensely lucrative The Rest is Football podcast on the BBC Sounds app.\nBrand and Culture expert Nick Ede told MailOnline that despite the disappointment of leaving MotD, the BBC Sounds tie-up for The Rest is Football will prove a lucrative sweetener for the star.\nBBC listeners won't hear adverts, but the access to the BBC's huge listenership will help him bump up prices for companies paying to promote their brands on other platforms such as YouTube, Spotify and Apple Podcasts, he said.\n'This is a great deal', Mr Ede said.\n'And it means lots more money for him – and downloads too.\n'Advertisers will be interested because although they can't promote on it as it's on the BBC, it's still the top sporting podcast'.\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured",
