I am very interested in them and they would be excellent options.\n\"I was attracted by the Premier League, the city of London and the fact that English is the economically dominant language in the world.\n\"And obviously Chelsea is a strong brand that has won two Champions Leagues.\"\nUltimately though, Endrick was unable to look past his dream of playing at the Santiago Bernabeu, where he could potentially play alongside Mbappe if his highly-anticipated move from Paris Saint-Germain goes through.\n\"I was told that it rains a lot in London, but that wouldn't be a problem because, as my father used to say, I always liked playing in the rain. But I always made it clear to my agent that my dream was Real Madrid.\"\nHe added about Mbappe possibly joining: \"Whenever there are high-level players within the team, the team will develop better, and consequently, it will be able to win in attitude, right?\n\"So whatever is best for Real Madrid and the entire team, let it be done. I just want to be happy playing my football like I always wanted. Obviously, if I can play with Vinicius, Rodrygo or Kylian it will be something very good. But Florentino [Perez] and all the people around him know what to do which will be better for the club.\"",
