  "body_text": "If Manchester United supporters are wondering how the club might be run under the ownership of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, they could take a look at how two other teams owned by his company Ineos are faring.\nFrench club Nice finished three points off a Champions League place in Ligue 1 last season and reached their first major cup final in a quarter of a century, beating Paris Saint-Germain along the way.\nAdvertisement\nYet this season, Ineos’ flagship football project are mid-table with an interim manager and several high-profile arrivals struggling to make an impact.\nThe company’s other club, Lausanne-Sport, are riding much higher in their respective league table, only a few points off the top of the Swiss Challenge League.\nThat, however, is Switzerland’s second tier. Last season’s relegation from the top flight was the second in Ineos’ five years of ownership, coming amid supporter unrest with those running the club.\nAn immediate return to the top flight is the fans’ minimum expectation. Their current position, in third place, would be enough only to reach a play-off.\nPresiding over it all is Ratcliffe: petrochemicals billionaire; one of Britain’s richest people; and, according to some United supporters, the antidote to the Glazer family’s 18-year reign of debt, dividends and declining standards.\nAs Ratcliffe has learned over the past six years of Ineos’ football operation, owning a club is rarely simple.\nIneos’ first foray into football came a little over five years ago on the banks of Lac Leman (also known as Lake Geneva), not far from the company’s Swiss headquarters in Rolle.\nLausanne were seven-time champions of Switzerland, though their last top-flight title came in 1965. A takeover by a company with annual revenues today of $65billion (£54bn) — and an owner whose net worth is £6.1bn, according to the 2022 Sunday Times Rich List — was welcomed, not least because of a recent brush with financial ruin.\nRelegation in 2002 due to a failure to obtain a licence from the Swiss Football Association was followed by bankruptcy a year later. They had to start again and reform — as Lausanne-Sport — in the fourth tier.\nThe club, which had competed in the top flight since the 1930s, has yo-yoed between divisions ever since.\nAdvertisement\nIneos’ ownership has brought financial stability and security. “Having a solid owner represented an important guarantee for the durability of our club,” says Vedouble, a Lausanne fan who runs the blog Les Pontheses, writing under a pseudonym.\n“Without them, we would certainly have had to leave the professional world for lack of a credible buyer.”\nAmbitions were slightly grander than mere survival at the outset. David Thompson, then chief executive of Ineos Football, touted the possibility of European qualification on completion of the takeover. Instead, six months later, came the first relegation.\nLausanne’s place in the Challenge League was confirmed by a 3-0 defeat by Thun in which they actually only conceded two goals. The match was abandoned after 70 minutes due to a group of Lausanne supporters attacking the away end and a 3-0 loss was later awarded.\n“Ineos discovered the richest sport in the world has its own rules that mergers and acquisitions consultants do not master,” wrote the local newspaper, 24 heures.\nIneos continued to invest. Plans to build a 12,000-capacity stadium that pre-dated Ineos’ takeover were improved upon, with the modern Stade de la Tuiliere opening three years ago.\nOver five years, Ineos has invested an estimated 50million Swiss francs (£44.9m; $54.3m) — which would barely cover a first-team signing at Old Trafford but which brought a 127-year-old club into the 21st century.\n“If sports were as good as marketing, we would be in the top three of the Super League every year,” says Vedouble.\nYet the goodwill generated with supporters by Ineos’ investment has been undermined by missteps.\nTwo months into the ownership, Ineos revealed a redesign of the club crest which stylised the ‘o’ in Lausanne-Sport in the same way as the ‘o’ in the Ineos logo. An orange trim was also added to the traditional colours of white and blue.\nAdvertisement\nFans were unhappy. Vedouble describes the incident as “undoubtedly the big negative point of the last five years personally”.\n“Many took this change as an affront and did not accept it, myself being the first,” he says. “You don’t mess with more than 120 years of history and even less for financial reasons. The historical colours of a club and its logo must be respected.”\nThe redesign was revised, with the Ineos ‘o’ and orange removed after consultations with fans, but it was the first of several incidents to strain the relationship between the ownership and supporters.\nThompson was a popular figure, regularly attending matches and even helping serve beer on matchdays, but a few months before the Nice takeover in 2019, he was replaced by Sir Jim’s brother, Bob Ratcliffe.\nLausanne were promoted back to the Swiss top flight the following season but that summer the sporting director Pablo Iglesias was dismissed amid a restructuring of Ineos’ football operations and a move to a multi-club model.\nIglesias’ replacement was Souleymane Cisse, who in 2006 co-founded Racing Club Abidjan in Ivory Coast — now the third club in Ineos’ stable. Cisse worked closely with Julien Fournier, his equivalent at Nice, as Ineos’ multi-club project took shape and a clear hierarchy was established.\nLausanne’s squad for their first season back in the Super League was supplemented with seven Nice loanees, many of whom had moved to the Ligue 1 club from RC Abidjan.\nGiorgio Contini, the coach who had guided Lausanne back to the Super League, left at the end of the 2020-21 season, his contract not extended despite a respectable sixth-place finish. His replacement, Ilija Borenovic, barely lasted beyond the halfway point of the following campaign.\nLausanne’s season cratered, winning just twice more under caretaker Alain Casanova to finish bottom of the Super League and 19 points off guaranteeing safety. On the fifth anniversary of Ineos’ takeover, Lausanne would be playing second-tier football again.\nAdvertisement\n“Ineos turned everything upside down by giving the reins of LS to Nice. Hence a loss of identity that has been very expensive,” Stefan Nellen, Lausanne’s former vice president under Ineos ownership, told 24 heures.\n“It is still difficult to understand what the project is,” Vedouble says. “The supporters are aware that Ineos is investing and that this is vital for the survival of Lausanne-Sport. Everyone is very grateful, myself included. However, the misadventures of the last five years have left their mark.”\nThe story of Ineos’ takeover of Nice in August 2019 begins at a press conference eight months earlier, when long-serving chairman Jean-Pierre Rivere and sporting director Fournier announced their resignations.\nA consortium led by Chien Lee, Alex Zhang and Paul Conway — NewCity Capital, which would later go on to invest in Barnsley among other clubs — had bought an 80 per cent stake in the Cote d’Azur club three years earlier.\nA third-place finish in Ligue 1 followed, Nice’s best in 41 years, and a title challenge had even appeared possible at one stage for a club that was last crowned champions in 1959.\nProblems were mounting behind the scenes, however.\n“It’s an open secret that we have had our differences with our owners and these tensions have intensified during the transfer window,” Rivere, a former player in Nice’s youth system, said upon announcing his decision to step away in early 2019.\nHe and Fournier would be back before the year was out, though. Undeterred by the challenges experienced in Lausanne, Ineos completed its takeover of Nice that summer.\nRivere and Fournier were reinstated to their former positions by Ineos, working alongside Bob Ratcliffe in the running of the club.\nHopes were high given the new ownership’s profile and financial resources and they made a good impression. Those who have worked with the Ratcliffes at Nice credit them with being open and accessible.\nAdvertisement\n“Jim is involved in all decisions,” says one former Nice employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity, along with others in this article, to protect relationships.\n“He was not there every day, Bob was there every day, but sometimes when a big company buys a football club, you never see the guys — just their number three or number four. Jim would make decisions.”\nBut like in Lausanne, the vision, ambition and optimism at the outset of Ineos’ ownership is yet to be fully realised.\nOne criticism is that Ineos put too much faith in the figures that were there before them, believing that the same structures only needed greater investment to improve results.\n“The people at the club before were good for the middle of the table but I think when Ineos bought the club, they wanted Champions League,” says one former employee.\n“When you want to be in the Champions League every year, you must have people who know how to play in the Champions League every year.”\nThe old system had worked up until that point. Rivere and Fournier — along with head coach Lucien Favre — were responsible for the impressive finishes pre-takeover, built on a model of acquiring young, inexpensive talent and selling at a profit.\nA year before the Ineos era began, Nice sold Jean Michael Seri, Maxime Le Marchand and Alassane Plea for a combined fee of £52million. Together, they cost only £2.1m.\nReturning to those responsible for implementing that model made sense. Yet Ineos’ arrival also resulted in Nice changing their transfer policy to make that leap to the next level.\nWhereas pre-takeover Nice’s net spend in the transfer market was typically positive, Ineos loosened the purse strings. Over the past three and a half years, Nice have spent a net outlay of more than €100million.\nLast summer, a number of high-profile names familiar to Premier League observers ended up on the Cote d’Azur — partly due to the influence of former Crystal Palace sporting director Iain Moody, who was working for the club in a consultancy capacity.\nAdvertisement\nRoss Barkley and Aaron Ramsey arrived on free transfers. Nicolas Pepe, Joe Bryan and Mads Bech Sorensen joined on loan. Kasper Schmeichel arrived for a cut-price fee.\nOn the final day of the recent January transfer window, Terem Moffi arrived on loan from Lorient until the end of the season with a €30million obligation to buy — a fee that will make him Nice’s record signing.\nNice’s wage bill at the end of the 2020-21 campaign stood at €55.2million — around average for a Ligue 1 club. That figure is taken from Nice’s most recent set of published accounts, which show a €29.6m loss during Ineos’ first full year in charge, compounding a €14.5m loss the previous year.\nThe effect of COVID-19 cannot be untangled from those figures and it is hardly unusual for ambitious new owners to speculate in order to accumulate. But fans might have thought that a willingness to spend money would have translated into greater success.\n“People expected so much when they see the name of the company but it does not work like that,” says one source close to the company. “If you’re not rich but you’re intelligent, sometimes you think if you had money it’ll be easy, but it’s not.”\nPatrick Vieira guided Nice to fifth place before Ineos’ first season at the helm was cut short by the pandemic. Vieira was sacked after an underwhelming start to the 2020-21 campaign and interim Adrian Ursea did not fare much better.\nAs Vieira’s permanent replacement, Ineos appointed Christophe Galtier, who had just led Lille to their Ligue 1 title in remarkable fashion.\nOvercoming the might of Paris Saint-Germain for a second successive season was always unlikely, but by late February, Nice were sitting second in Ligue 1, 15 points adrift of top spot but with realistic aspirations of Champions League qualification.\nYet Nice’s 2021-22 season began to unravel, with tensions between Galtier and sporting director Fournier mounting behind the scenes and coming to a head in the weeks after the defeat in the Coupe de France final against Nantes.\nAdvertisement\nGaltier’s side also lost four of their last 10 games in Ligue 1 to finish a disappointing fifth. Either a trophy or a Champions League place last season would have been the first true, tangible success of the Ineos era. Nice fell just short on both counts.\nIf Ratcliffe could be accused of not changing enough upon taking over at Nice, the past year has been one of revolution rather than evolution — not just on the Cote d’Azur but across Ineos’ football operation.\nAt Lausanne, Cisse’s unpopularity among the supporters eventually led to his departure, with him now overseeing operations at RC Abidjan. Ludovic Magnin, a Lausanne-born local, is the new face in the dugout.\nAt Nice, Galtier left for PSG and Fournier for Parma. Galtier’s replacement was Favre — another pre-Ineos figure brought back into the fold — but he was dismissed last month after an underwhelming start.\nMost significantly of all though, Bob Ratcliffe has stepped away and is no longer leading Ineos’ football operations. The younger Ratcliffe brother was not replaced as head of football, with Ineos instead installing new chief executives at Nice and Lausanne.\nAll of these changes followed an audit led by Sir Dave Brailsford, who was appointed as Ineos’ director of sport in late 2021.\nThe general manager of cycling team Ineos Grenadiers — formerly Team Sky and Team Ineos — was tasked with bringing Nice into line with the other, more successful arms of the company’s sporting operations.\nBrailsford is a well-known figure in British sport as the brains behind Great Britain’s dominance of cycling at the Olympic Games and for his role with Team Sky, where he oversaw six Tour de France victories in seven years.\nHowever, a Parliamentary report in 2018 claimed Team Sky had given performance-enhancing drugs to riders said to be for the treatment of medical conditions.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2021, a tribunal found that former British Cycling and Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman ordered testosterone a decade earlier “knowing or believing” that it was to be given to a rider for doping.\nA statement by Team Ineos — who took over sponsorship from Sky in 2019 — said “the team does not believe that any athlete ever used or sought to use Testogel or any other performance-enhancing substance”.\nBrailsford has remained in overall charge of the cycling team throughout but has stepped back from its day-to-day management and expanded his responsibilities across Ineos’ sporting interests in sailing, Formula 1, rugby, marathon running and football.\nHe is working alongside Jean-Claude Blanc, the former PSG general manager who is Ineos’ new chief executive of sport.\nBlanc is an experienced, well-respected operator. Formerly chief executive at Juventus during their post-Calciopoli rebuild, Blanc began work at the start of this month. While Brailsford’s focus is described as “world-class performance management”, Blanc will oversee the company’s entire sports portfolio.\nLausanne are still bouncing between Switzerland’s first and second tiers, but with improved facilities and greater financial security.\nNice are hardly surpassing expectations either but breaking into the elite is challenging in a league with only two automatic Champions League qualification spots, especially when one of those is sewn up by PSG.\nThough the past 12 months have been turbulent, results have started to pick up under caretaker Didier Digard, who is unbeaten since taking charge a month ago.\nIt is hoped the changes at both clubs over the past year push Ineos closer to success on the pitch, which a source with experience of working with Ratcliffe maintains is the billionaire’s ultimate motivation.\nA shortcut to achieving that would be buying a bigger, higher-profile club.\nAdvertisement\nRatcliffe launched a late £4.25billion bid for Chelsea, which was rejected out of hand by the Raine Group, the investment bank which is also conducting United’s sale.\nWhereas some who have worked under Ratcliffe struggled to see the logic behind acquiring a mid-level club like Nice, the allure of owning Chelsea or United is obvious.\n“They’ve realised the history of a club is important and sometimes, even with the money, it’s complicated to change things,” says one source, speaking anonymously to protect relationships.\nOne hurdle to clear could be Ineos’ multi-club model. According to article five of UEFA’s regulations, two or more clubs deemed to be part of the same ownership cannot compete in the same UEFA competition.\nWhile this is not as immediate a risk as with reported Qatari interest in United and Qatar Sports Investments’ ownership of PSG, the prospect of United and Nice competing in the same European competition is not remote.\nIf both qualified for the Champions League, for example, whether or not both could play in the competition would depend on how European football’s governing body perceived their ownerships.\nIn that scenario, Ratcliffe might be forced to make a choice in the same way Red Bull did when it restructured its ownership of Salzburg in 2017, allowing the Austrian club and RB Leipzig to compete in the same UEFA competitions.\nAny such choice for Ineos is a long way down the line, though. Before that, there is a race to be won for the keys to Old Trafford.\nIneos’ time in Lausanne and Nice has so far been a steep learning curve. At United, it would only get steeper.\n(Top image: designed by Eamonn Dalton using Getty Images)",
