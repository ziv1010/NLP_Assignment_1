  "body_text": "Juventus winger Federico Chiesa has been linked with a move away from Italy this summer.\nAccording to a report from Fichajes, Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle United are keen on the 26-year-old Italian winger.\nMikel Arteta is reportedly looking to add more depth to his squad and the Italian has been identified as a potential target. Chiesa has had a reasonably good season with Juventus, scoring 10 goals in all competitions. He is likely to cost around €40-45 million this summer. It will be interesting to see if Arsenal can get the deal done.\nThe Gunners need more depth in their squad if they want to do well across multiple competitions. They will be hoping to win the Premier League title and the UEFA Champions League in the upcoming season.\nThey will face competition from London rivals Chelsea, who are looking to bring in upgrades on players like Raheem Sterling, Mykhailo Mudryk and Noni Madueke. All three players have had mediocre seasons and the Blues are looking for a more reliable attacker.\nThe Italian will certainly be a quality addition and it remains to be seen whether he is ready to join a club without Champions League football. Chelsea had a mediocre season by their standards and they will look to bounce back strongly. They need to sign quality players in order to get back to the top of English football once again.\nNewcastle want Federico Chiesa\nFinally, Newcastle United are on the player as well. Miguel Almiron has been linked with a move away from the club and the Magpies are looking at the Italian international as a potential alternative. He is versatile enough to operate on both flanks and he will add goals and creativity to the side.\nThe reported asking price might seem steep and it will be interesting to see if Arsenal, Chelsea or Newcastle can convince Juventus to accept a more reasonable offer..",
