And they were the hosts.\nBefore that, Morocco had only qualified for the tournament on two previous occasions: 1998 and 2000.\nA year later, Morocco finished second in the group stage of the 2023 Women's World Cup, qualifying ahead of tournament favorites, before falling to France in the knockout stage.\nThat performance: a historic second-place finish at WAFCON 2022, and a round of 16 exit at the World Cup, was deemed \"unsatisfactory\" by the Royal Moroccan Football Federation.\nOn October 12, 2023, Reynald Pedros was replaced by Jorge Vila, who had just won the World Cup with Spain.\nWhile Morocco was replacing a multiple UEFA Women's Champions League winner with the current World Cup-winning coach, Ghana, albeit a little underwhelming, was also making changes.\nHead coach Mercy Tagoe-Quarcoo made way for Nora Hauptle in January 2023.\nAs you may have guessed, the GFA statement that announced Tagoe-Quarcoo's replacement was less colorful.\n\"From 2009 to 2012, she was a coach at FC Thun and later worked as a conditioning coach for Tennis player Romina Oprandi. Nora previously worked with the Israeli Football Association as Head Coach and Women’s Director for the national team and also had a stint with SC Sand 1946 – a German Women’s Bundeliga club,\" the GFA said.\nThat was the sum of her experience in top-level coaching.\nIt was a modest appointment, but also a sign of mediocrity; symptomatic of a country that was not looking to challenge for the big things.\nQuite a bit has happened since then.\nNora Hauptle launched a failed Olympic qualification bid, but more importantly, returned Ghana to the AFCON.\nThe story of why she sat on Zambia's bench at a tournament she qualified Ghana for, is a matter for another day.\nBut in plain terms, she felt frustrated by Ghana's preparations for the tournament. So, despite being offered improved terms, Hauptle left the role at the expiration of her contract.\nKim Lars Bjorkegren, who replaced the Swiss, has been a competent hire.\nBut the state infrastructure behind the project he superintends is nothing compared to what the man in the opposite dug out enjoys.\nIn the last 10 years, there have been three mass player revolts, and they were all because of money.\nIn September 2015, the Queens refused to leave the M-Plaza hotel over unpaid bonuses after winning gold at the African Games in Congo Brazzaville. The amount involved was $25,000 per player.\nA year later, the Queens marched to the Parliament of Ghana, and then the Sports Ministry, to demand payment of the same bonuses.\nIn June 2021, Elizabeth Addo, then captain of the team, complained on Twitter about the team's lack of preparations ahead of a World Cup Qualifier against Nigeria.\nShe was subsequently ostracised from the team for that.\nThe same problem occurred again when the GFA nearly cancelled scheduled friendlies against Senegal and Tunisia last year.\nWhy? Let's just say that between the Ministry and the GFA, neither was ready to raise $40 000 to fund the games at the time!\nIn the end, the team only played Senegal of the two planned friendlies.\nThat is the recent history of the women's game in Ghana and the attitude of successive governments towards it.\nGhana's Ambassador to Morocco, Mrs. Charity Gbedawo, is expected to be in the VIP box for tomorrow's game.\nHopefully, she sees the extent of investment Morocco has committed to this project, and how, without ever making it out of a WAFCON group stage, they are suddenly attracting Champions League winners and World Cup winners.\nHow are the best coaching minds flocking to Morocco?\nHow are Moroccan clubs suddenly competitive on the continent, even winning the Champions League in 2022?\nHow do we stop the era of Black Queens players hitting the streets in protest of unpaid bonuses? Or refusing to leave the team hotel over unpaid bonuses?\nShe is not the Minister for Sports. But she is responsible for the team in Morocco in two weeks, and she has seen the disparity between what we pretend is women's football management and what actual management of the women's game is.\nPerhaps the Sports Minister, Kofi Adams, has been paying attention.\nEven if he has not, it does not take much to spot the chasm between Ghana's attitude towards the women's game and how countries like Equatorial Guinea, South Africa, and Morocco approach the game.\nLatest Stories\n-\nThe Accra Mandate: Securing Africa’s AI Future through Local Data and Ethical Governance\n22 minutes -\nAquafresh donates to National Chief Imam ahead of Ramadan\n47 minutes -\nAdopt a mix of bond and short-term finance to address financing challenges in cocoa industry – Professor Peprah to government\n49 minutes -\nNSA introduces dual authentication system for 2025/26 enrolment exercise\n2 hours -\nFuel prices to increase from Feb. 16, influenced by cedi’s depreciation\n2 hours -\nGNFS to launch automated fire safety compliance system to modernise regulation\n3 hours -\nNALAG president commends Local Gov’t Minister for payment of assembly members’ allowances\n3 hours -\nIs having a physical security operations center in your business worth it?\n3 hours -\nAsiedu Nketia recounts fierce political wars in Ajumako-Enyan-Essiam constituency\n3 hours -\nNRSA sets up committee to probe road crashes involving Toyota Voxy\n3 hours -\nCocoa farmers decry the adverse impact of producer price cut on livelihoods\n3 hours -\nFamilies who lose relatives to ‘no bed syndrome’ must sue health facilities – Dr. Nawaane\n3 hours -\nGhana Sports Fund: Dr. David Kofi Wuaku outlines vision for Youth Empowerment growth through sports\n3 hours -\nNUGS President urges sustainable digital governance\n3 hours -\nNational Investment Bank kicks off Ghana Sports Fund with landmark seed donation\n3 hours",
