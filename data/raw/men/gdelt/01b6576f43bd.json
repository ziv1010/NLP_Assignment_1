It was an action that required full power from him, had to change direction and he felt something.’\nWhile Saka will miss the trip to Merseyside, there remains a measure of hope that Arsenal’s captain will be able to play a part.\n‘He hasn’t trained yet and, if he does, it will be tomorrow,’ Arteta, who also confirmed Leandro Trossard is a doubt, added. ‘He is doing everything he can to make himself available.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?
