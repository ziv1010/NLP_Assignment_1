Spain have lost just one game since the protest began.\nVilda named a provisional squad for the World Cup in early June with Bonmati, Caldentey and Batlle returning. The other 12 players either stayed firm in their stance or were not selected despite making themselves available again.\nThe coach maintained his loyalty to many of the players he had turned to in the interim.\n\"We've always been looking to solve this conflict and it's practically resolved,\" said Vilda.\n\"We're focused on the players who are committed.\"\n'We are not rebels'\nThe RFEF has improved the players' travel arrangements, extra fitness staff and physios are available, and the players are less tightly monitored during call-ups.\nHowever, some did not think the RFEF went far enough.\n\"It makes me sad as I deserve (to go) and I contributed to getting the team there,\" said Mapi Leon in May, reiterating why she was continuing her protest.\n\"It's not a decision that you take lightly and it's not easy. My decision is clear. Mapi Leon has a way of living and she has values to stick to.\n\"I can't go back, there has to be changes.\"\nSpanish reports suggested Barcelona star Putellas acted as a mediator between the returning players and the RFEF, and although she is not the team's captain, she is their footballing leader.\nPutellas, who had backed the complaints but did not join the initial boycott because of her injury, did not like the tag of \"rebels\" some gave the players.\n\"We are not rebels,\" she said in March.\n\"It's exhausting having to constantly call for improvements to perform better.\"\nWith the double Ballon d'Or winner back -- albeit with her fitness in question -- Spain believe a first World Cup triumph is possible, even if the bitterness lingers.\n\"We are sixth in the world rankings,\" said Vilda.\n\"Spain has never had such a complete side with such good chances, we want the World Cup to start.\"\n© 2023 AFP",
