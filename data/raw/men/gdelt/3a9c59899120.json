Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘Moi [Caicedo] is a magnificent player and has been top since I came in but we make a poor decision there. We give away a penalty.\n‘The penalty goes in, they hit a few long balls, pick up some second balls. The lad handballs it and it affects my players.\n‘We just have to make sure we take care of moments and be professional. The ridiculous thing for us is that they’ve managed to score two goals in a five-minute period and for the rest of the game, we were the better team.\n‘I genuinely can’t remember Leeds having a shot or a moment in the game.\n‘Anything can happen in football when you don’t take care of key moments, but I hope people can see the progression already. There’s a change in the things I like to see.’\nReacting to Palmer’s shocking miss, Rosenior added: ‘He’s in the position, 999 times out of 1000, he scores, it was just that one in that moment.\n‘We shouldn’t be in that position. The game should be done at 2-0. I need to show the players certain things to make sure that doesn’t happen again.’\nChelsea goalscorer Pedro, meanwhile, insisted the Blues ‘need to be more consistent’ after the ‘very frustrating’ draw with Leeds.\n‘We are very frustrated because I think we started the game very well,’ he told TNT Sports. ‘We controlled the game, 1-0, 2-0 and then we conceded.\nMore Trending\n‘I think this season has been like this. We need to be more consistent, more focused and kill the game. Today it happened again. Tomorrow we need to look at ourselves and see where we need to improve.\n‘It is not only today but other games at home we dropped points. If you want to be in the Champions League, you can’t drop points like this.’\nAn unlikely point at Chelsea leaves Leeds 15th in the Premier League, six points above the relegation zone.\nChelsea face Hull City in the FA Cup this weekend while Leeds visit fellow Championship side Birmingham City.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Chelsea TV presenter urges club to sign Arsenal target and loan out £30m star\nMORE: Marc Cucurella injury update after Chelsea draw with Leeds United\nMORE: Michael Carrick makes Benjamin Sesko claim after Manchester United’s draw with West Ham",
