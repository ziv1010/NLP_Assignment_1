We've got you covered. AC Milan vs Napoli is on BT Sport in the UK. Brit abroad? Use a VPN to watch the Champions League with your subscription from anywhere.\nNapoli have been one of the stories of the season, both at home and on the continent.\nSixteen points clear at the summit of the Serie A standings, it is only a matter of time before they are crowned champions of Italy for the first time since 1990.\nThe Partenopei have also caught the eye in the Champions League, winning seven of their eight matches and scoring 25 goals.\nBut Milan have greater European pedigree and recently thrashed Napoli 4-0, so this is not a foregone conclusion.\nKick-off is at 8pm BST.\nTeam news\nMilan will be unable to call upon the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Pierre Kalulu at San Siro.\nNapoli will again have to make do without Victor Osimhen, with Gio Simeone set to continue up top in the Nigerian's absence.\nForm\nMilan have won just one of their last six matches in all competitions, but that was the aforementioned 4-0 thrashing of Napoli at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.\nThat was Napoli's only defeat in their last five games, and Spalletti will hope it was merely a one-off.\nReferee\nIstvan Kovacs of Romania is the referee of AC Milan vs Napoli.\nStadium\nAC Milan vs Napoli will be played at San Siro in Milan.\nKick-off and channel\nAC Milan vs Napoli kick-off is at 8pm BST on Wednesday 12 April in the UK.

See below for international broadcast options.\nVPN guide\nUse a VPN to watch Champions League football from outside your country\nIf you’re out of the country for a Champions League fixture, then you won't be able to watch on your domestic streaming service as usual. The broadcaster knows where you are because of your IP address (boo!) and blocks you from watching it. You can use a VPN to get around that, though, without resorting to illegal feeds you’ve found on Reddit.\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN), assuming it complies with your broadcaster’s T&Cs, creates a private connection between your device and t'internet, meaning the service can’t work out where you are and will let you watch. And all the info going between is entirely encrypted, anonymous and safe – and that's a result.\nThere are plenty of good-value options out there. For the Champions League, FourFourTwo currently recommends:\nExpressVPN including a 30-day, money-back guarantee\nFourFourTwo’s brainy office mates TechRadar love its super speedy connections, trustworthy security and the fact it works with Android, Apple, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, PS5 and loads more. You also get a money-back guarantee, 24/7 support and it's currently available for a knockdown price. Go get it!\nInternational Premier League TV rights\n• UK: Sky Sports and BT Sport are the two main players once again, but Amazon also have a slice of the pie in 2022/23.\n• USA: NBC Sports Group are the Premier League rights holders, with the Peacock Premium streaming platform showing even more than the 175 games it aired last season. If you pick up a fuboTV subscription for the games not on Peacock Premium, you'll be able to watch every game.\n• Canada: The way to watch Premier League football in 2022/23 is fuboTV, which has exclusive rights to all the action.\n• Australia: Optus Sport will screen every game of the Premier League season. Non-subscribers can access the action via a Fetch TV box and other friendly streaming devices.\n• New Zealand: Sky Sport are serving up all 380 games – plus various highlights and magazine shows throughout the week, as well as the Champions League.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nGreg Lea is a freelance football journalist who's filled in wherever FourFourTwo needs him since 2014. He became a Crystal Palace fan after watching a 1-0 loss to Port Vale in 1998, and once got on the scoresheet in a primary school game against Wilfried Zaha's Whitehorse Manor (an own goal in an 8-0 defeat).",
