And that’s what happened.’\nAccording to Spanish publication SPORT, Guler has grown increasingly frustrated with his peripheral role at Madrid and will strongly consider his future at the end of the season.\nGuler is said to be desperate to boost his game-time ahead of Turkey’s 2026 World Cup campaign and feels a move may be necessary in order to achieve this, unless his situation improves over the coming months.\nMore Trending\n‘I try and give my very best with every opportunity I get,’ Guler said after scoring twice in Madrid’s win over Deportiva Minera last month.\n‘I got the goals today and helped the team. I’m thrilled to be chipping in but the win was the most important thing.\n‘We put in a great team performance. I hope we can keep winning these games, playing this well and making our fans happy,’ Guler said after scoring twice in Madrid’s win over Deportiva Minera last month.\n‘It was a fantastic team display today, I hope we can keep playing like this.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Real Madrid confirm injury boost ahead of Man City Champions League second leg\nMORE: Borussia Dortmund’s huge Jamie Gittens asking price amid Man Utd, Liverpool and Chelsea interest\nMORE: Hansi Flick delivers verdict on £83m Barcelona star amid Chelsea transfer links",
