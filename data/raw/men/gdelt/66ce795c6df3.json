  "body_text": "Jose Mourinho says he is fully focussed on footballing matters and his reunion with former favourite Scott McTominay will not be on his mind when Benfica take to the field against Napoli.\nThe Special One has had a mixed start to life as head coach of Benfica having returned home to Portugal to over the reins from Bruno Lage back in September.\nHis Benfica side sit third in the Primeira Liga table, eight points adrift of league leaders Porto and three points behind bitter rivals Sporting, who they drew with last Friday.\nIn the Champions League, meanwhile, Benfica are languishing down in 31st place in the group-stage standings after losing four and winning just one of their opening five matches.\nMourinho will be hoping their position drastically improves by the end of the night, but his team may have to be at their very best to get the better of Napoli, the reigning Serie A champions.\nThe visitors will be without the injured Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku at Benfica’s Estadio da Luz, though, two players Mourinho, of course, managed and let go when in charge of Chelsea.\nHowever, McTominay, who was given his Manchester United debut by Mourinho, is ready and available to feature for Napoli and will no doubt be looking to continue his outstanding run of form in front of his old boss.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nAsked if he was excited to catch up with McTominay and Leonardo Spinazzola, who he worked with at Roma, Mourinho told reporters: ‘These exciting things happen before and post-match. Nothing more.\n‘During the match, I don’t think about these things.\n‘We have to win this game against a very strong opponent and it will be extremely difficult.\n‘We’ll do everything to get the result we want.’\nMourinho batted away any suggestion that Napoli may struggle given they will be without the likes of De Bruyne and Lukaku in Lisbon.\n‘Injuries? Don’t make me laugh,’ the ex-Manchester United, Chelsea and Real Madrid head coach replied.\n‘It’s my absences that make me cry, but I don’t want to. Not having De Bruyne, but having McTominay is the same.\n‘They had to change their formation and now they’re even better than before.’\nNapoli boss Antonio Conte has been delighted with the way his squad have responded in the face of their mini injury crisis, with Frank Anguissa, Billy Gilmour, Alex Meret and Stanislav Lobotka also sidelined.\n‘It’s a moment where the players are demonstrating a great sense of responsibility,’ Conte said at his pre-match press conference.\n‘Even if there’s a small problem, we all have to overcome it together.\n‘We face some difficulties in replacing players in midfield, but the boys have given their full availability and so the ones from the last match are here.’\nMore Trending\nConte still views Mourinho as a serial winner and is greatly looking forward to testing his wits against the iconic Portuguese.\n‘Ultimately, it’s always a pleasure when you come up against Jose Mourinho’s teams,’ the Italian added.\n‘We’re talking about a winning coach and there’s very little that must be said when explaining who he is.\n‘It will be a pleasure to meet and greet him.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Rio Ferdinand urges Man Utd to make ‘unbelievable offer’ for Liverpool star\nMORE: Martin Keown names the signing Barcelona need to win the Champions League\nMORE: Thierry Henry says Liverpool star is ‘not at the races’ after Inter Milan win",
