The Scot was appointed as manager in 1945 and reigned for the next 24 years, revitalising United with an infusion of homegrown talent.\nHis young \"Busby Babes\" won successive titles in 1956 and 1957 and United become the first English team to compete in the European Cup.\nBut disaster struck in 1958 when eight United players, including the great Duncan Edwards, died after a plane crash at Munich airport on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final against Red Star Belgrade.\nBusby spent weeks in hospital before eventually returning to build another dashing young team from the ashes of the Munich tragedy.\nGeorge Best, Bobby Charlton and Denis Law formed the attacking triumvirate that spearheaded Busby´s second golden generation.\nBest was the maverick genius whose pop star looks and dazzling skills made him famous beyond the world of football.\nUnited won the English title twice before their defining moment in 1968, when they beat Benfica 4-1 to become the first English team to win the European Cup.\nIt was a cathartic victory for Busby, who wept on the Wembley pitch a decade after the Munich disaster. \"The moment when Bobby took the cup it cleansed me. It eased the pain of the guilt of going into Europe. It was my justification,\" Busby said.\nBusby´s decision to step down in 1969 signalled the end of an era for United and the decline was so steep that United crashed into the Second Division in 1974. They won promotion at the first attempt and lifted the FA Cup in 1977, 1983 and 1985.\nBut United never came close to regaining the title during a troubled period as their arch-rivals Liverpool reigned supreme. United were rescued from their wilderness years by Alex Ferguson, who arrived from Aberdeen to manage the under-performing club in 1986.\nWith 38 trophies, including 13 Premier League titles, during his 26-year reign, Ferguson fulfilled his aim of \"knocking Liverpool off their perch\" in spectacular fashion.\nThe Scot endured a difficult start that included calls for his sacking but United won the FA Cup in 1990, buying him time to fashion a vibrant side that secured the club´s first league title for 26 years in 1993.\nInspired by the flamboyant Eric Cantona, the club won their first league and FA Cup double a year later. Ferguson´s greatest moment came in 1999, when United became the first English club to win the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup in the same season.\nIt was United´s ´Class of ´92´ -- the storied youth academy crop including David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers -- who were the treble winners´ driving force.\nShowing the never-say-die spirit that epitomised United under Ferguson, they scored twice in the final minutes against Bayern Munich in the Champions League final.\n-\nJames Van Der Beek's Final Conversation With Director Roger Avary Laid Bare: 'We Cried'\n-\nJaden Smith Walks Out Of Interview After Kanye West Question At Film Premiere\n-\nMichelle Obama Gets Candid About Spontaneous Decision At Piercings Tattoo\n-\nWhy Halle Berry Wasn't Ready For Marriage After Van Hunt Popped Question?
