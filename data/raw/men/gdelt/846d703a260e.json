That is planning that’s already underway, and other people are in charge of it at the moment.”\nAlternatively for Liverpool, with defender Joel Matip seemingly set to leave the Anfield outfit this summer, the Reds may be on the look out for a new centre-back and Tosin could fit the bill in that regard – particularly as he has similar attributes to the 32-year-old.\nIt is clear Tosin, who had a number of injuries in the first part of the season but has been ever present in Fulham’s defence since the turn of the year, will not be short of options at the end of the campaign.\nTosin harbours Champions League goals\nThe big defender certainly is not short on confidence, either. Not only does he believe he can thrive at international level, but he believes he is good enough to play in the Champions League one day.\nGO DEEPER: Tottenham told €40m offer should be enough to land Postecoglou another Serie A defensive sensation\nHe told The Times in February: “England have good centre halves like [John] Stones, but I’d definitely back myself to be a top international footballer. Every player has ambitions to reach those tournaments, just like I have the ambitions to reach the highest points of club football, too.\n“We all know my contract’s up in the summer but all things are still possible. My main focus is on having a good end to the season.”\nWhen asked if he is a Champions League level player, he replied: “I believe so.”",
