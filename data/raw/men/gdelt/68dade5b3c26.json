There are suggestions Europa League glory may not be enough to save Postecoglou’s job, but it would be quite the way for the Australian to sign off.\nCan Amorim alleviate pressure and aid rebuild?\nA post shared by Manchester United (@manchesterunited)\nRuben Amorim has produced more eye-catching quotes (numerous) than Premier League wins (six) since succeeding Erik ten Hag in November.\nDespite that, United fans have stuck behind the candid Portuguese coach in a campaign where the Europa League has offered some relief and hope.\nBut their much-needed rebuild will be hugely damaged if they fall to their first European loss of the season at San Mames, meaning they would spend a first season without European football since 2014-15. It has long been a case of Bilbao or bust for United, where the financial ramifications help explain why Amorim says Champions League qualification is more important to him than lifting the Europa League itself.\nBilbao braces for a full English\nThe Basque Country will welcome hordes of English fans as supporters take all manner of weird and wonderful routes to the final. Fan behaviour is unsurprisingly a hot topic in Spain, where additional checks greeted arrivals at Bilbao airport.\nLocal media’s fears of potential trouble when United played the semi-final at Athletic Bilbao earlier this month unsurprisingly proved unfounded, but fans from two English clubs descending on the area – many without tickets – raises different questions.\nThe Basque government’s security minister Bingen Zupiria admitted being “nervous”, but the previous all-Premier League final in Spain went off smoothly as Tottenham lost the Champions League showpiece to Liverpool in 2019.",
