It worked itself out in that game. Then the same thing against Buffalo, and again it worked out. Now it is officially not working out. Brian Johnson stinks at calling an offense, he's ruining Jalen Hurts, they're wasting Jason Kelce's (most likely) last season. But is there even anyone out there that can fix the Eagles offense?\nThere may be one name that we're all familiar with in Philadelphia. Frank Reich. We loved him when he was here. We were upset to see him go, because he wasn't supposed to leave. It was when a 2x failed head coach Josh McDaniel decided he was, then wasn't, taking the Colts job they came looking for Reich. There is plenty of love between the Eagles, Nick Sirianni and former Eagles OC and Colts Head Coach Frank Reich.\nWhen Nick Sirianni was an assistant in Indianapolis his head coach was Frank Reich. The offense should be close to, if not the same sort of scheme they ran together in Indy. Sure Reich has been fired as a head coach in back to back seasons. This year in Carolina shouldn't count. Owner David Tepper is doomed to fail with such a short hook on a talented coach. Also QB Bryce Young is a disaster and looks to be another doomed Alabama QB. Reich might be the perfect guy to get this ship righted. Look how good Carson Wentz was under Reich's tutelage. Then look how bad he was once Reich was gone.\nAt this point you have to bring Reich in. How much more could it hurt? Feelings be damned. Nobody feels bad for Sean Desai. He's making plenty of money up in the coaches box. It shouldn't bother Jalen Hurts, who doesn't seem like that kind of player anyway. He wants to be the best out there, and Reich can help him be just that. If Jeffrey Lurie and Howie Roseman weren't already on the phone with Frank Reich prior to the plane taking off from Seattle, then we're in for a long final 3 weeks of the regular season. Also a quick first round exit in the NFL playoffs.\nThe All-Time Roster Of NFL Players From the Philadelphia Area\nWho are the best football players of all time from the Philadelphia area? We have been putting together rosters of only local guys for all 4 teams. First we did the active rosters, and there were some mixed results. The Eagles actually wound up with a decent team, and the Sixers could be in the playoffs. But the Flyers and the Phillies? Well they would pretty much be riding the coattails of a few great players, with a lot of mediocrity elsewhere on the roster. But now we are moving on to the All-Timers. We already did Sixers, and saw them get led by two of the best players in NBA history. But would the all time NFL squad look like with local guys?\nWe put together that list, picking the best starters at each position on Offense, Defense, and Specials Teams. Who is the best QB from the Philly area? What legendary Safety grew up around here? And what trio of great WRs all grew up near Philly? Our area might not be as well known for creating great Football players as some southern states like Texas and Georgia. But you can still put together one hell of a team from guys born in or near Philadelphia.\nThe rules to be eligible for the team are simple. If your hometown is closer to Philly than any other NFL city, you can make the list.\n97.5 The Fanatic has put together rosters of the best professional athletes from the Philadelphia area who could make up rosters of the four major sports franchises.\nHere is the All-Time Roster of Football Players From The Philadelphia Area:\nQB- Matt Ryan- Exton, Pa\n(Photo by Todd Kirkland/Getty Images)\nIt essentially came down to Matt Ryan, Matt Schaub, or Joe Flacco. Not that those guys are bad QBs, but when you are talking All-Time greats, I was hoping there was a Hall of Fame Caliber guy. Maybe they can work something out with Pittsburgh who have a claim to Johnny Unitas, Joe Montana, Jim Kelly, George Blanda, and Dan Marino. Matt Ryan was easily the most productive of this group, and has an All-Pro to his name. So he gets the spot. To his credit, he was a very good QB, just not on the level of Marino or Montana.\nRB- Franco Harris- Fort Dix, NJ\n(Photo by Bob Grieser/Allsport/Getty Images)\nThe pride of Rancocas Valley Regional High School in Mt Holly NJ. I would know, because I went to the same school. I saw the entire trophy case dedicated to him. Harris is a Hall of Famer, a 4 time Champion, a Super Bowl MVP, a 9-time Pro Bowler, and one of the greatest players in Steelers history. And he was involved in one of the greatest plays in NFL history, the Immaculate Reception.\nRB- LeSean McCoy- Harrisburg, Pa\n(Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images)\nThe rule is you go to whatever city you are closer to, and Harrisburg is closer to Philly than Pittsburgh. I obviously don’t need to explain to Eagles fans how great McCoy is. He is one of the best running backs in team history, and the franchise leader in rushing yards. He accomplished that despite Chip Kelly pushing him off the team for some reason while he was still in his prime.\nWR- Marvin Harrison- Philadelphia, Pa\n(Photo by Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images)\nWithout a doubt, the best WR from our area is Marvin Harrison. The Hall of Famer made 8 Pro Bowls, 3 All-Pro teams, led the league in receiving yards twice, and finished his career with 128 TDs. He also has a son, Marvin Harrison Jr, who is projected to be a top 5 pick this year, and could easily crack this list 10 years from now.\nWR- Irving Fryar- Mount Holly, NJ\nMandatory Credit: Andy Lyons /Allsport\nSpeaking about Rancocas Valley, Irving Fryar also hails from there. He has the most Touchdowns (84) for any player from NJ in league history. Fryar made 5 Pro Bowls in his 17 year career between the Patriots, Eagles, Dolphins, and Washington.\nWR- Andre Reed- Allentown, Pa\nMandatory Credit: Rick Stewart / Stringer\nThis Eagles team certainly would not lack playmakers. They already have one Hall of Fame WR, why not add another one? Andre Reed spent 15 of his 16 seasons with the Bills, racking up 13,198 yards and 88 total touchdowns. With Reed, Harrison, and Fryar running routes, they will make any QB look like a Hall of Famer.\nTE- Frank Wycheck- Philadelphia, Pa\nMandatory Credit: Brian Bahr /Allsport\nWycheck did not have the most impressive career stat wise. It was solid, but not All-Time great material. But he was a solid player for the Oilers/Titans for years. And he had a big part to play for the greatest play in Titans history, the Music City Miracle. It was Wycheck who took the handoff, before passing it across the field to Kevin Dyson, who preceded to throw a 75 yard TD pass downfield to beat the Bills.\nRT- Erik Williams- Philadelphia, Pa\nHaving a Cowboy on the team may feel wrong, but for over a decade Philly native Erik Williams held down the right side of the Cowboys O-Line, and did so at a high level. He made 4 Pro Bowls, 2 All-Pro teams, and helped them win 3 Super Bowls in the 90s. We can be proud of him for being from Philly and having a great career. And still hate him for helping the Cowboys win 3 Super Bowls.\nRG- Jahari Evans- Philadelphia, Pa\n(Photo by Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images)\nComing out of a Division II college in Pennsylvania, no one expected much from Evans. But he went on to be one of the best OGs of his era. He played 12 seasons, 11 with the Saints, and made 4 All-Pro Teams, 6 Pro-Bowls, and made the All-Decade Team for the 2010’s. Philly loves an underdog, and Evans was an underdog who rose to true greatness. You could even make the case he belongs in the Hall of Fame.\nC- Chuck Bednarik- Bethlehem, Pa\nMore known for his work at Linebacker, Bednarik also played Center for the Eagles. He would basically stay on the field the entire game, even taking some special teams snaps. So he will play both for this hypothetical Eagles team as well.\nLG- Mike Munchak- Scranton, Pa\n(Photo by Grant Halverson/Getty Images)\nThe interior of the Eagles O-Line is perhaps the strongest part of this team. They have two Hall of Famers in Bednarik and Munchak, and one borderline Hall of Famer in Evans. Munchak made 2 First Team All-Pros, and then 6 2nd Team All-Pros. He also made the All-Decade team for the 1980s.\nLT- Bryant McKinnie- Woodbury, NJ\n(Photo by Larry French/Getty Images)\nOf all the Offensive Linemen on this team, McKinnie has the least personal accolades. He has one Pro Bowl to his name, and wont be going into the Hall of Fame like the other guys. But he had a successful 12-year career, mostly with the Vikings.\nDE- Micah Parsons- Harrisburg, Pa\n(Photo by Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images)\nThe edge rushers for the All-Time team stay the same as it was with the active team. Just because of all the edge rushers out of this area, none have had the same success as Parsons and Reddick have to this point in their careers. Parsons is one of the bets players period right now. And by the end of his his career, his place on this list will probably be unquestioned with the pace he is one.\nDT- Joe Klecko- Chester, Pa\n(Photo by Nick Cammett/Getty Images)\nThe recently inducted Hall of Famer had to have a place here. Klecko played 12 years, 11 of which were with the Jets, playing both DE and DT. He finished his career with 2 All-Pro selections and 78 sacks. He also played his College ball at Temple, so he gets double credit for staying local in College.\nDT- Christian Barmore- Philadelphia, Pa\n(Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)\nI had a really hard time finding great DTs from the area. Even Klecko spent most of his time as a DE. Maybe I missed someone, and if I did, please let me know about out. But in the end, I just ended up going with another guy from the Active All-Philly Area team. Barmore is in the midst of a career season, and has turned into a force, especially against the run.\nDE- Haason Reddick- Camden, NJ\n(Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images)\nLike Parsons, Reddick made both the active and All-Time team. Reddick has been of the most dangerous pass rushers in the league these past several seasons. And while both he and Parsons still have a lot to prove to be considered All-Time greats, you can see them being considered as much when it is all said and done. And like Klecko, he is a Temple alum. So he is Philly through and through.\nLB- Chuck Bednarik, Bethlehem, Pa\nWe already talked about Bednarik at center. But he is probably even better known as a Linebacker. His crushing hit on Frank Gifford is still one of the greatest plays in NFL History. Bednarik is one of the first names that comes up when you talk about All-Time great Eagles. So him also being from the area, makes him a no-brainer to make this list.\nLB- Dave Robinson, Mount Holly, NJ\nDave Robinson was helping run the Packers defense back in the days of Vince Lombardi. He got enshrined in both the Pro and College Football Hall of Fames, one of only 22 Penn State Alumni to accomplish both feats.\nCB- Troy Vincent- Trenton, NJ\nMandatory Credit: Al Bello /Allsport\nAfter starting his career with the Dolphins, Troy Vincent joined the Eagles in 1996, and went on to start at Corner for them for 8 years, including into the Jim Johnson era. He and Bobby Taylor were the dynamic duo at corner before it was Lito Shepard and Sheldon Brown, and you could argue they were an even better corner duo. Vincent made 1 All-Pro team and finished his career with 47 interceptions.\nCB- Herb Adderley- Philadelphia, Pa\nYet another member of that Green Bay defense in the Lombardi era, and like Robinson Adderly was a Hall of Famer too. He made 5 All-Pro teams, and finished his career with 48 interceptions. He also was the cornerback for the All-Decade team in the 60s.\nS- Deron Cherry- Riverside, NJ\nPhoto By: Stephen Wade / Getty Images\nDeron Cherry is not in the Hall of Fame. But he probably should be. How are you going to put a guy on the All-Decade team in the 80s, but say he is not a Hall of Famer. If he is one of the best Safeties over an entire decade, you are a Hall of Famer in my book. The Rutgers alumni also has made 3 All-Pro teams and holds a tie for the record for most interceptions in 1 game (4).\nS- Emlen Tunnell- Bryn Mawr, Pa\nJust a quick rundown of a few of the many great accomplishments of Emlen Tunnel. His 79 career interceptions are still the second most in NFL history, over 60 years after retiring. He was the first black player to be enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was named to the All-Decade team in the 50s. And he retired with several other record that have since been broken such as consecutive games played, Punt Return Yards, and Interception yards. To be it mildly, he is a legend, and one of the best Safeties in NFL history.\nK- Brandon McManus- Philadelphia, Pa\n(Photo by Andy Lyons/Getty Images)\nOur area does not develop kickers and punters well. McManus was not only the best option, he was pretty much the only option besides another active kicker, Matt Amendola. McManus is a solid kicker. In 10 seasons, he has just 2 seasons where his FG% dropped below 80%.\nP - Christian Pulisic- Hershey, PA\n(Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\nI couldn’t find a single even passable punter in the history of this area. None. I went back to the 30s in Pro Football Reference for Pa, NJ, and De, and found no one who lasted for than a couple years as a punter. So instead of putting some punter who wasn’t even good enough to last in the NFL, I just got the best soccer players from our area. Pulisic is good enough to play overseas and is one of the stars of the US Soccer team. He might be a terrible punter, but he has a better chance to be good than any of the actual punters from our area.",
