Like Kamara, Alonzo was born and spent his formative years in the working-class district of La Soude, in the south east of that port city on the Mediterranean.\nComme le veut la tradition, @boubaKamara_4 a dû chanter pour sa 1ère convocation en A ! 🎤 😄 pic.twitter.com/Ddo8gwAqud\n— Equipe de France ⭐⭐ (@equipedefrance) May 29, 2022\nAlonzo’s music resonated with Kamara. His affiliation with the city and its football club entrenched who he was; son of a Senegalese father and a Corsican mother, Cathy, who has represented him in contract negotiations.\nKamara joined La Commanderie, Marseille’s youth programme, aged just five and 17 years later had fulfilled a dream of playing for France at senior level. “I am very happy, very proud, for myself and my family,” he said, a few hours before his initiation was due.\nThis is the story, told chronologically, of the Aston Villa midfielder’s childhood, youth and career, by people who witnessed it:\nClement Goguey — Boyhood friend and later a team-mate in Marseille’s B side.\nNasser Larguet — Marseille’s former academy technical director.\nThomas Fernandez — Former director of Marseille’s training centre who worked across multiple roles within the club, including assistant coach and B team manager.\nIbrahim Rachidi — A team-mate, coach and former mentor with Marseille B.\nLaurent Roussey — Holds the record as the youngest Frenchman to play in a European-level quarter-final, with Kamara second and the youngest Marseille player to do so.\n*Please note each conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.*\nThe start and his family — 1999-2005\nKamara joins Marseille’s renowned academy. He regularly attends first-team games as a fan with his parents (who were season ticket holders in the northern section of Marseille’s Stade Velodrome), brother Djibril and sister Djena.\nAdvertisement\nClement Goguey: I met Bouba when he was three, so a couple of years before he joined Marseille. We started at the club from a very young age but I knew him earlier because of his mum. She worked at my school, in the canteen. I would see him around and we became friends. Bouba was always very discreet on and off the pitch.\nNasser Larguet: Cathy is really pleasant. She was very attentive to the development of her little family and of her son. She is discreet — Bouba is like that. She never demands anything from her child but lets him grow. She always looked after his interests first and never tried to claim the additional benefits (money, broader privileges et cetera) some parents might do if their child played like Bouba.\nThomas Fernandez: Out of the family, I met his mum most often. She always had an attentive eye to the evolution of Bouba, coming to training, matches and generally being his backbone. He was a boy with no problems. His mother watched over him a lot.\nMarseille’s youth teams — 2005-17\nKamara’s ascension through the age groups at Marseille is serene. He is described by multiple coaches as “efficient”, with his development following a linear trajectory. His pathway into the first team is expected, rather than anticipated. Kamara earns international recognition in 2015 with a call-up to France Under-17s, marking the start of the teenager playing in every one of the age groups from there to the senior side.\nIn early 2016, at 16, he is promoted to the Marseille B team, while the rest of his peers remain at under-17 level. The decision is taken by incoming B-team head coach Jacques Abardonado and his predecessor, Fernandez, who has become first-team assistant manager.\nHaving made his senior debut in the French League Cup in December 2016, Kamara captains Marseille Under-19s to the final of the Coupe Gambardella, the most prestigious competition in French youth football, the following May.\nAdvertisement\nFernandez: I first met Bouba in the 2014-15 season, when he was 15. I had arrived a year earlier and part of my job was to speak to other coaches about him. I talked to Rafael Guerrero, coach of the under-17s, along with Stephane Nado, the under-19s coach. The decision to move him up age groups involved every staff member. I knew he had a great reputation internally.\nThe coaches all agreed he was a boy who already read games. Although he was not the most mature physically, he was so good technically. His placement (positioning) would be perfect and he would be good in duels. There were a lot of things where we saw him becoming a central defender.\nI first played him at centre-back for Marseille B on February 20, 2016. I remember the date because his performance was so clear. That day he reminded me of Franz Beckenbauer; he was very comfortable and everything he did exuded class. I knew he could play. A boy who is a technical leader with character, but doesn’t make a lot of noise. Off the pitch, he could seem distant but he was a cool, pleasant boy.\nGoguey: He always went through the ages without making much of a sound. But in two years with the reserves I found him to be a different level. His greatest strength was — and is — his calmness. It helps him in everything he does, like his technical quality in possession, his ball protection or waiting for the right moment to make the pass. He was made for the pro game; his mentality was built for the pro game.\nIbrahim Rachidi: I met him around a similar time, in 2016. I’m 20 years older than him but we became friends. He was a charming boy. There was one anecdote: I remember when he first trained with the reserves, he was still in the youth changing room. Each time after training he would cross over the training pitch with (team-mate) Maxime Lopez. Instead of wanting to go into the older dressing room, he would just come into the coaches’ office for a chat and a laugh. We used to joke he talked with coaches more than he did players, thinking he was old himself!\nWe played one match together in central defence against (lower-league side) US Le Pontet. I felt such strength and maturity from him, constantly taking control of all situations.\nFirst-team breakthrough — 2017-22\nFour months after that Coupe Gambardella final, which Marseille lost to Montpellier on penalties at the Stade de France in Paris, Kamara’s 2017-18 breakthrough season begins.\nAdvertisement\nNow team-mates with future and former Villa players Morgan Sanson and Jordan Amavi, he becomes Marseille’s youngest European debutant in a 1-0 victory over Turkey’s Konyaspor in the Europa League group stage, aged 17 years, nine months and 22 days.\nMarseille progress to the knockout phase, then eliminate Braga of Portugal and Spanish side Athletic Bilbao. When they face Germany’s RB Leipzig in the April, Kamara fractionally misses out on becoming the youngest Frenchman to play in a European quarter-final. At 18 years and four months he is second only to Laurent Roussey, who was two months younger when he did it for Saint-Etienne in 1980.\nLaurent Roussey: Nowadays, clubs in France take precautions with young players. He seemed very sure of himself and had a natural engine. I looked at Kamara and thought he had variety in his positioning but held largely defensive instincts. Although Marseille lost (1-0 in the first leg in Germany, before going through 5-3 on aggregate), he had this particular confidence against Leipzig. He could be excellent technically, but his vision measured the speed of the game, seeing sequences one step ahead.\nLarguet: I met Kamara when he was already established in the first team, in 2019. He was being seen as an example to youngsters then. When I joined, the club spoke to me about him a lot. I realised Kamara was the symbol of Marseille, a pure product of the city. He started at the club’s football school, was quiet off the pitch but felt empowered on it.\nHe was a player who loved his club. A player who loved winning for his team because he was inhabited by this idea of Marseille winning trophies and him, a kid from La Soude, being the guide for the team, despite not having such an expressive personality. The boy could play in a four-man defence and in a three-man midfield. I remember asking him to play at the back at the last moment in the Coupe de France because Duje Caleta-Car was injured, and he did very well.\nI then trained him for two months directly and the possibilities were endless. He played mostly central defender but I used him in a midfield double pivot. I thought he would be better used in front of the defence because he had a good recovery technique and was vertical in possession. When manager Jorge Sampaoli arrived (in early 2021), he used him in different positions because Sampaoli said he was a boy who understood quickly. We didn’t need to make great speeches explaining all the information to him.\nFernandez: I remember when he had just turned 16 and I put him in a double pivot for the first time. I had no concerns. He immediately validated his level and I reported back to the rest of the staff that we — although we can never be sure — had the future of Marseille on our hands.\nAdvertisement\nMarseille fallout — 2022\nDespite having to play under a string of Marseille managers, Kamara’s precocious talent is illustrated by his consistency. Meanwhile, he and his partner, the model and reality TV star Coralie Porrovecchio, become parents in May 2020 when son Leeroy is born.\nBy 2021, Kamara is attracting attention from some of Europe’s biggest clubs, encouraged by the protracted nature of new-contract negotiations with Marseille. He enters the final 12 months of his existing deal. “It would kill my heart to leave,” says Kamara.\nLarguet: We saw him as a player made for Marseille. Often, we say to ourselves, ‘Ah, what a training club Marseille is’ but he was among the last of this generation with enormous potential to stay here. He had all the qualities: physical, technical, mental and adaptable, which made him one of the rare young players able to play at Marseille, because we asked them to always perform at the top of the table, qualify for the Champions League and play in it.\nRachidi: It’s true supporters didn’t understand and know the ins and outs. Bouba spoke about the differences he had with the management and where the club was headed. It was a shame it got to that stage. I hope, in time, there is still a good image of a young Marseille boy who gave everything for the club he loves and went through all the age groups.\nJoining Villa and France call-up — 2022\nIn March of last year, Marseille president Pablo Longoria announces Kamara will not be signing a new contract. Manchester United, Arsenal and Newcastle United are among the interested parties as his deal goes into its final few months. “To lose a player at the end of the contract, especially one of your best and one with one of the best (transfer) values in the squad, is always a failure,” Longoria says.\nAston Villa, in the meantime, are putting in preliminary groundwork in the hope of acquiring the midfielder. Kamara does not confirm his Marseille departure until mid-May, but his availability is an open secret within footballing circles.\nVilla’s then boss Steven Gerrard visits the 22-year-old at his home in France with the desire to finalise an agreement before the end of the 2021-22 season. Gerrard goes to watch Marseille’s 3-2 Ligue 1 win over visitors Nantes in the April, where Kamara is named man of the match.\nAdvertisement\nThe level of resentment from Marseille supporters amplifies, feeling let down by a player who had been viewed as one of their own. Kamara signs a five-year deal with Villa on May 23. The long-standing ties with his hometown club make the break-up even more acrimonious.\nDespite a direct approach from Senegal, the birth country of his father, Kamara makes his senior France debut in a 1-1 draw with Croatia in the Nations League two weeks after joining Villa.\nLarguet: He delayed the deadline to leave to respect Marseille. He respected his contract until the end. It must have been difficult, leaving slowly. That’s why I think it caused a bit more tension than had he left straight away.\nRoussey: The disappointment was that Aston Villa is not an elite club in England for us French people, so it was a bit surprising. And then the fact Marseille’s management could not replenish the coffers (with a transfer fee). He was a youngster from the training centre Marseille couldn’t keep. If he had gone to one of England’s top six clubs, it would have made more noise across the country and continent.\nRachidi: There is still a good image of him, even if there was misunderstanding with supporters that he left for free. But that side of the story has been buried and the people of Marseille, I think, are mostly proud to see a young person develop at a club like Aston Villa.\nA new start, and the future — 2022-\nEven disrupted by injury, Kamara enjoys a stellar debut campaign in England and establishes an impressive midfield partnership for Villa with Douglas Luiz. Unai Emery replaces the sacked Gerrard last October and sparks an immediate uplift in overall performance, with Kamara being voted the club’s player of the month for January by the fans. He earns a late call-up to the France squad for their two European Championship qualifiers in June this year following an injury to Adrien Rabiot, which delays honeymoon plans after he and Coralie get married at the start of that month.\nVilla captain John McGinn describes Kamara to The Athletic as “world-class” while Liverpool, in their succession planning for Fabinho, have him high on their list of possible replacements.\nAdvertisement\nKamara stays at Villa though, and remains a great source of satisfaction inside the club that they managed to sign him in the first place. In the 1-0 win at Stamford Bridge, he puts in one of his performances for Villa, winning the battle in midfield against two players, Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez, who cost Chelsea a combined £215m (€247.7m).\nFernandez: He approaches matches without pressure. For him, it’s the same to play in the first team, in the reserves or in the under-19s. So this is a boy who has always been ready. And when a boy is very good and has a well-surrounded family, age is no problem.\nRoussey: He can be a regular for France. I can see him playing in a back three but it depends how he will evolve as a midfielder, whether at Aston Villa or at the next level.\nLarguet: This is a player made for Marseille and France. He is one of the best players I have known. I have worked at lots of French clubs with lots of young players. There were boys like Lassana Diarra, Didier Drogba, Anthony Le Tallec and Florent Sinama Pongolle, who all played quickly and young in the first team. Kamara was a receptive boy who felt the game on his fingertips and knew what his position needed to be.\nOf all of the players I worked with, he is top of the basket. He had real character on the pitch. He always wanted to play — I played him all the time. He was never a substitute with me or with the other coaches. In my mind, there was no doubt Kamara had all the qualities to succeed.\n(Top photos: Getty Images)",
