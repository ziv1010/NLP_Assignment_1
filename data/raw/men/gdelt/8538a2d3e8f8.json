What’s not to like?\nHarrison Ashby\nThe 23-year-old looks to have benefited from his two seasons on loan with Swansea City and Queens Park Rangers, although he has not yet started 50 competitive games.\nUsually a right-back, Ashby played in midfield today and he offered energy, poise and speed in the first half against Athletico.\nCould he be a ready-made replacement for Sean Longstaff or the injured-again Joe Willock in a season that is bound to stretch our resources to the limit?\nThe wait is almost over\nOkay, I’m clutching at straws a bit here but the scenes before kick-off at a sold-out St James’ Park, with black-and-white flags fluttering in the sunshine as Local Hero was blasted over the PA system, were enough to remind me why football still matters.\nUnited will go to Villa Park next Saturday having lost to Celtic, Arsenal, the K League All-Stars and Atleti but at least we can look forward to a match that counts for a lot.\nNEGATIVES\nToothless, not ruthless\nFans of a certain age will recall the Seventies rear windscreen sticker of Supermac with the legend “Toothless but ruthless”.\nWe matched Atleti in the first half without severely testing their keeper, except from one powerful free kick by Kieran Trippier. Joelinton dominated his opponents in the air when we attacked but was off-target with three headers before sending a fourth straight at the keeper. Harvey Barnes, Anthony Gordon and Elanga made inroads, as did Ashby, but there was nobody capable of scoring.\nGordon was being touted as the man most likely to play centrally in attack. He made umpteen sprints to close down the keeper and defenders until, chasing another lost cause in the closing minutes, he seemed to damage a leg muscle in a non-contact incident. Unlike Willock, he walked off the pitch in no apparent pain but the way he carried on straight down the tunnel makes me wonder if he will be available for the big kick-off.\nTough opposition\nFor the final pre-season match you want a proper test.\nThere are few tougher than Diego Simeone’s outfit, who have been ever-present in the Champions League for more than a decade. Atletico Madrid know how to win and are prepared to defend a lead by fair means and foul. If a player beats you with skill, grab his shirt. Or leave a foot in. Or dive to win a free kick.\nAs preparation for what awaits United in Europe, it perhaps served a purpose. Whether Elanga, Gordon and Barnes, among others, enjoy counting their bruises today is another question.\nTechno no no no!\nFirst half good, second half not so good. The club’s official coverage died just before the first goal. Good old Radio Newcastle told us what had happened and no pictures were needed to realise the atmosphere had vanished almost as quickly as the clean sheet.\nBy the time somebody corrected the technical fault there were only 15 minutes to play, most of which the Spaniards spent ensuring they would not concede. At least United’s new strip seems to be made from decent fabric; a shoddier product would have split at the seams.\nFinal score:\nNewcastle 0 Atletico Madrid 2\nGoals:\nNewcastle:\nAtletico Madrid:\nAlvarez 50, Griezmann 63\nAttendance:\n51,584\nNewcastle team v Atletico Madrid:\nPope, Ashby (Alfie Harrison 61), Lascelles, Botman (Alex Murphy 46), Livramento, Trippier (Shahar 87), Joelinton, Tonali, Elanga, Gordon (Neave 84), Barnes\nUnused Subs:\nRuddy, Gillespie, Charlton, Kuol, Sanusi\nNewcastle United pre-season friendly schedule 2025/26\nSaturday 12 July – Newcastle 4 Carlisle 0 (Behind closed doors)\nSaturday 19 July – Celtic 4 Newcastle 0\nSunday 27 July – Arsenal 3 Newcastle 2\nWednesday 30 July – Team K-League All Stars 1 Newcastle 0\nSunday 3 August- Spurs 1 Newcastle 1\nFriday 8 August – Newcastle 2 Espanyol 2\nSaturday 9 August – Newcastle 0 Atletico Madrid 2\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
