  "body_text": "Arsenal have again started a Premier League season well under Mikel Arteta and, at present, after a brilliant win at Sevilla on Tuesday, are looking good for qualification from their Champions League group as well as keeping pace with those around them in the English top-flight.\nThe Gunners have bottom-of-the-table Sheffield United at the Emirates Stadium as their next fixture, before two difficult trips away at West Ham (Carabao Cup) and Newcastle (Premier League) and then the return against Sevilla which could ultimately determine whether they can then make the knockout stage of European football’s premier competition with two games to spare.\nWith that being so and ahead of the Champions League return in March, it’s clear that Arteta would need to strengthen his squad.\nAccording to 90Min (h/t Football Fan Cast), the Gunners manager is personally keen on acquiring Aston Villa’s brilliant midfielder, Douglas Luiz.\nThe Brazilian, who capped a fine display at the weekend with two goals to help sink West Ham United, would be a fine addition to Arsenal’s current squad, however, Arteta’s quest is likely to end in disappointment.\nThe outlet also note that there is no chance that Villa will sell to their Premier League rivals because they want to secure Champions League qualification themselves for next season.\nWhether that stance puts off the Gunners from even making an approach will be seen in due course.",
