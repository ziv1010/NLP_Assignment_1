  "body_text": "These are three massive positives this season for Newcastle United\nWe wanted to get a snapshot of how Newcastle United fans are thinking.\nThree months into the season and 17 matches played so far across three competitions.\nNow in the November international break and Newcastle United fans seeing their team win eight games, draw three, lose six.\nThose results summing up a start to the season with plenty of ups and downs.\nPlenty to talk about as we ask a number of Newcastle United fans, who are regular/irregular contributors to The Mag, to give us their views on the season so far, plus what will happen as we move forward.\nNext up is Wor Lass answering the questions.\nThree words to describe how you currently feel as a Newcastle fan?\nSlightly pee’d off!\nThree words to describe Newcastle United now?\nOff the pace.\nAlexander Isak – Time to forgive and forget…? Please discuss.\nI don’t consider myself a vindictive person but I’ll make an exception for him.\nHe’s a rat and I won’t feel sorry for him no matter how bad things may get. He’s a fool to have left in the manner that he did and I hope he’s regretting it big style.\nWhat really boils my urine over that whole sorry saga is the way Liverpool got away Scot free with tapping up our player. The last game I was at at SJP, Sissoko was booed off – that will seem like a mild expression of disapproval compared to what awaits the Rat when he eventually trots out on the hallowed turf.\nIf you had to choose. A win against Sunderland but lose to Fulham in Carabao Cup quarter-final, or lose to Sunderland and go through to Carabao Cup semi-finals?\nDefinitely the win at the Stadium of Light. We need the league points and the bragging rights, plus I can’t see us winning the cup again, anyway.\nWould winning the Carabao Cup again this season BUT finishing outside the Premier League top six, be success or failure?\nI’d say success as things stand right now. We possibly won’t do any better than Conference League qualification via the League position now, so winning a trophy again would be wonderful.\nHand on heart, what is your best estimate (not hope!) of where Newcastle United will end up this season in the Premier League, the Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup, how well they will realistically do in each of them?\nI hate questions like these – too many variables.\nLeague place 7th, CL Quarter Final, FA Cup 5th Round, League Cup Semi Final\nIn order, which six NUFC players have been the most impressive so far this 2025/26 season?\nTonali, Thiaw, Woltemade, Murphy, Trippier, Bruno/Burn (both a bit inconsistent)\nIn order, by the end of the 2025/26 season, which six NUFC players do you think will have proved the top performers?\nTonali, Thiaw, Woltemade, Bruno, Murphy, Wissa (fingers crossed)\nEight months ago, Eddie Howe banked the first trophy for Newcastle in 56 years, then two months later secured a second Champions League qualification in three years. Some Newcastle fans appear to be questioning his position now. What are your thoughts on Eddie Howe and how much more time has he earned to get the league position sorted and beyond that, or not?\nEddie must have plenty of credit in the bank. However, the league away form needs to be sorted.\nIt’s not so much the results that will worry others in the corridors of power but any concern that Eddie à) doesn’t know why it’s happening and b) doesn’t know how to stop it from happening. If the power brokers at the club lose confidence in his ability to sort things then anything can happen. Believe me – I have friends who are Bordeaux fans!\nWhat do you think about how the summer transfer window was conducted by Newcastle United?\nGiven the circumstances with two important rats deserting the ship in close succession, I think they did well. It’s incredibly irksome to be used as a stalking horse by the financial “big boys” but we came out of it very well in the end. The one that got away, for me, was Ekitike, who absolutely hit the ground running and proved what a great judge of a player Eddie is. But then it’s nice being the “idiots” who coughed up the dough for Big Nick. Malick Thiaw has proved to be the icing on the cake. Wissa must be chomping at the bit – can’t wait to see him in action for us.\nHow much do you think Newcastle United having no CEO or Sporting Director contributed to the fact NUFC signed only one player (Elanga) who had a proper pre-season?\nNot much at all, to be honest. I think the majority of the delays and switch of target were entirely down to finances and cynical plays by rival clubs and the targeted players themselves. We were in a Catch 22 situation with Isak – we didn’t really want to lose him but couldn’t afford to budget for his replacement until we received an acceptable and bona fide offer. If I was going to blame one party for all of this it would be Liverpool.\nWhat do you see as three positive things for Newcastle United so far this season?\nOur form in the CL has been really encouraging and I feel confident we’ll get through to the knockout phase.\nWe’ve progressed well in the Carabao Cup again and have another home draw to come next.\nWe have a midfield rock in Sandro Tonali who, if handled correctly, could be our talisman for many years to come.\nWhat do you see as three negative things for Newcastle United so far this season?\nObviously, our away form is a worry and is letting us down badly. As I said before, it’s not so much the results as the manner of them that worries me. The last two bad losses to West Ham and Brentford are worrying and need relegating to history asap!\nThe deafening silence regarding relocation of the training centre and redevelopment/rebuilding of the stadium is becoming a concern. I know the 2028 Euros throws a spanned in the works for the ground but it could take until then to get all the Leazes ducks in a row anyway. It just all adds fuel to the silly notion that the Saudis have lost interest. Let’s have some concrete news.\nTicketing issues are a constant and this needs addressing. The new CEO has made all the right noises and seems to have initiated a bit more fan consultation but things are still far from ideal. Fans need transparency, à system that works and, ultimately, someone to talk to when it doesn’t – and preferably someone who a) WANTS TO and b) CAN do something about it.\nSunderland are now back in the same division and at this moment ahead of NUFC, your thoughts?\nGood luck to the Mackems, I say. As long as we beat them and finish higher up in the league then I don’t care how they do, really. My Mackems neighbours have moved back to Blighty (not to Sunlun, of course) from France and we miss them. We’ve no one to take the Micky out of! They must worry about losing their manager because he’s done a terrific job for them under difficult circumstances. I watched their match against Arsenal and they were full of energy and belief. If we aren’t up for it, it will be a very uncomfortable game at the Stadium of Brown stuff. Seagull Xhaka has been the PL signing of the season so far.\nWhat would represent success in the 2025/26 season for Newcastle United?\nEither winning a trophy again or qualifying for the Champions’ League. À tough ask as things stand but there’s just about time to turn it around. IF – Eddie can figure a way out of the away day blues and Wissa comes back fighting fit and delivers. I’m normally fully behind players wanting to represent their countries but, in his case, I think he owes it to the the club and the fans to stay over Christmas and fight for our league position.\nWhat do you see as the minimum to achieve this coming season?\nQualifying for one of the European competitions next season. The fans deserve those European nights. Maybe a lower level comp would give us the thrills without the same level of pressure. CL is still best, though.\nPredict the top six in the Premier League (in order) and which three clubs will be relegated.\nTop 6: Arsenal, Man City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Man Utd\nBottom: Forest, Burnley, Wolves\nI don’t think it’s impossible for us to finish top six but I’d need to see some firm movement upwards over the next three or four league games. Those other teams are all playing better than us right now.\nWith NUFC now having won a trophy…has that changed your priorities at all with the club now balancing getting Champions League football on a regular basis, compared to try and win cups?\nWhile it’s always great to win a trophy (I now know that for a fact!) we will never compete on an even playing field with the clubs that gazumped us this summer until our commercial revenue, therefore spending power, equals theirs. Therefore, I would regretfully say that CL qualification has to be our number one priority from now on. That doesn’t mean we can’t win trophies as well, though!\nNext three seasons, would you rather finish top four all three seasons BUT win nothing, or finish mid-table all three seasons AND win the FA Cup in one of the three?\nI think I just answered that one. If we keep finishing mid-table then Eddie won’t be here any more and I think the Saudis COULD lose interest.\nWhat are your thoughts on the fact that we are now more than four years after the takeover and still no plans announced on a new training ground, nor a far bigger capacity stadium (either brand new one, or an increased capacity St James’ Park)?\nAgain, I’ve addressed this elsewhere. Davey Hat-Trick mentioned everyone having a mate who knows an architect etc…. Well, the son of one of my best mates is a partner at Fosters and a massive toon fan – and he knows nowt about the plans!\nIf Newcastle United were to look to the transfer market to strengthen the team/squad in January, what do you see as the priority (or priorities…)?\nLeft back cover, striker cover and a Declan Rice style midfield protector of the back four. That one might have to wait until the summer, though.\nWould you say winning the Carabao Cup last season has made you more content, or now more desperate to get the next one?\nMore content – it’s the monkey off the back.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
