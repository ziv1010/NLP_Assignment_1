  "body_text": "Yanga hunt Silver in Malawi\nMALAWI: THE historic Bingu National Stadium in Malawi sets the stage for a fiery showdown as Tanzanian giants Young Africans face-off Malawi’s Silver Strikers in the first leg of their CAF Champions League knockout tie this evening.\nWith the group stage tantalisingly within reach, both teams are poised to deliver a match brimming with intensity, skill and raw determination.\nYanga, boasting a rich pedigree and extensive experience in both the CAF Champions League and Confederation Cup, enter this clash with confidence and focus.\nThe Tanzanian powerhouse know that victory in this opening encounter, kicking off at 4 pm local time, will put them one step closer to the coveted group stage. Yet, the job will only be complete after the return leg at Dar es Salaam’s Benjamin Mkapa Stadium.\nYanga supporters are brimming with hope that their side can claim all three points on foreign soil, though they remain mindful that football is a game of fine margins where a single moment can rewrite the story.\nSilver Strikers arrive having played four recent matches with a mixed record: one win, two draws, and a single loss. Meanwhile, Yanga have been in scintillating form, going unbeaten in their last four games, with three victories and a draw fuelling a fiery spirit within their camp.\nExperience undeniably favours Yanga. The Jangwani giants are seasoned campaigners on the continental stage, while the Malawian ‘Bankers’ embark on their CAF Champions League debut, a maiden voyage filled with both pride and pressure.\nThough Silver Strikers previously competed in the CAF Confederation Cup, they fell short of reaching the group stage—a chapter they now hope to rewrite with a historic run.\nYanga Head Coach Romain Folz has named a strong 24- man squad for this crucial tie. The team’s backbone features goalkeepers Djigui Diarra, Abutwalib Mshery and Abubakar Khomein.\nThe defensive line is anchored by stalwarts Israel Mwenda, Lassine Kouma, Chadrack Boka, Mohamed Hussein, Dickson Job, Frank Assink, Bakari Mwamnyeto, Ibrahim ‘Bacca’ Hamad and Aziz Andabwile.\nMidfield dynamism comes from Balla Conte, Mudathir Yahaya, Duke Abuya, Muhammed Doumbia and Pacome Zouzoua. The attack boasts firepower with Edmund John, Offen Chikola, Célestin Ecua, Maxi Nzengeli, Prince Dube and Andy Boyeli ready to trouble the Silver Strikers’ defence.\nUnder the guidance of Dutch tactician Pieter de Jongh, Silver Strikers will lean on forwards – Zebron Kalima, Duncan Nyoni and Stain Davie. Midfielders are Patrick Macheso, Uchizi Vunga, Maxwell Paipi, Chikondi Kamanga and Levison Maganizo, while defenders are Precious Sambani, McDonald Lameck, Nickson Mwase and Tatenda Mbalaka. Goalkeepers are George Chokooka and Charles Thom.\nYanga will, however, be without key striker Clement Mzize due to a thigh strain and defender Dickson Job sidelined with a hamstring injury—challenges that test the squad’s depth and resilience.\nWith the decisive return leg set to unfold in two weeks at the iconic Benjamin Mkapa Stadium, anticipation builds for a clash where dreams and destiny intertwine.",
