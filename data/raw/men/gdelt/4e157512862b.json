  "body_text": "Wesley Sneijder believes Inter Milan are the only team capable of locking down Paris Saint-Germain when they meet in the Champions League final tonight.\nAfter years of frustration and disappointment in the competition, PSG have enjoyed a sensational run to the final in Munich on Saturday.\nA dazzling array of talent spearheaded by Ousmane Dembele and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia has slain three Premier League sides en route with Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal all falling at their feet.\nInter return for their second final in three years after their unforgettable semi-final victory over Barcelona, progressing after a 7-6 aggregate victory.\nSneijder was part of the last Inter team to win club football’s biggest prize, part of the Jose Mourinho machine along with Samuel Eto’o, Diego Milito, Thiago Motta and Maicon that secured a historic treble in 2010.\nHaving watched PSG dispatch three English teams on the bounce, the Dutchman believes an Inter team that boasts the best defence in the competition is better equipped to deal with PSG and punish the Parisians.\nWhere the Premier League’s best were undone, Sneijder believes Inter have the answer.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘If you see the English teams PSG played against, all of them they tried to play the game their way, they tried to attack,’ Sneijder told Metro. ‘But on the other side, that gives a lot of space to the opponent.\n‘PSG were happy with that way of playing. So there were space to exploit. And of course they have the quality to do something with that. But on Saturday it will be a totally different game. Inter don’t mind leaving the ball to PSG.\n‘Inter, they have great defenders, they defend as a team and they are waiting for mistakes. They have such power down the sides, especially down the right with Denzel Dumfries so it is going be a very different approach for PSG to deal with. Inter are so dangerous in the transition and can punish them.’\nInter missed out on the Serie A title a week ago with Napoli sealing the crown on the final day of the season last Friday. The Champions League is the bigger prize for Simeone Inzaghi’s side with Sneijder convinced his old side must be considered favourites.\nMore Trending\n‘They are the favourites for me,’ he said. ‘At the end of the season, they put everything into getting to the Champions League final. Heading into the last game of the Serie A season, I don’t think they believed anymore about winning the championship.\n‘Because they thought Napoli wouldn’t make mistakes. So they have been waiting for this game. It has been 15 years and now is the right moment to get this trophy.’\nWesley Sneijder was speaking on behalf of BetMGM.
