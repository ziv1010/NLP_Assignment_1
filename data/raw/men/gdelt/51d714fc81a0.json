They found their second goal in the 70th minute, with Lynda picking out Yeboah, who took advantage of an error in judgement by the Etihad goalkeeper, before slotting it into the back of an empty net.\nThe Juggernauts defended in numbers for the remaining 20 minutes.\nIndia custodian Shreya Hooda also made a couple of remarkable saves in the dying minutes to ensure the win and cap off a historic night in Indian women's football.\nIn the Group Stage of the AFC Women's Champions League, Odisha FC will travel to Vietnam to face Urawa Red Diamonds Ladies (Japan), Taichung Blue Whale Women's Football Team (Chinese Taipei), and hosts Ho Chi Minh City Women's FC (Vietnam).\nThe Group Stage comprises three groups of four teams and will also be contested in a centralised league format from October 6-12.\nThe top two finishers of each group and the two best third-placed sides will progress to the quarters to be played on March 22 and 23, 2025.\nA knockout stage draw will be conducted prior to the quarterfinals to determine the four pairings, which will be contested in a single-leg format, with the higher-ranked team of each tie to serve as the home side.\nThis will be followed by a centralised finals, which will see the semi-finals and final -- all single-leg ties -- being played out from May 21-24, 2025, to determine the first ever champions of the AFC Women's Champions League.\n(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nMore From This Section\nDon't miss the most important news and views of the day.
