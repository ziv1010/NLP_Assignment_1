  "body_text": "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has told Ruben Amorim where he wants Manchester United to finish next season after the head coach suggested he could resign.\nUnited are already condemned to their worst Premier League season in history with the club dropping to 16th in the table after a 2-0 home defeat to West Ham on Sunday.\nWith two games left, the Red Devils can finish no higher than 13th and with a maximum 45 points – 13 less then their record lowest tally set in 2021/22.\nRemarkably, the club have gone backwards since the sacking of Erik ten Hag and subsequent appointment of Amorim in November, with the Portuguese winning just six of his 25 league matches.\nThere is one bit of good news: United have reached the final of the Europa League where they’ll face Tottenham – themselves 17th in the table.\nVictory would mean a trophy and qualification for next season’s Champions League, but following the loss to West Ham, Amorim shockingly suggested he could leave Old Trafford if results did not improve.\n‘I don’t want to talk about players. I’m talking about myself, the culture in the club, the culture in the team,’ the 40-year-old said in his post-match press conference.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?
