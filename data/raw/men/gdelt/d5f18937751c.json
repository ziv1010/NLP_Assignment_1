Arsenal losing at home to West Ham simply rubber stamping that.\nThis is how the Premier League table looks today (Monday 24 February 2025):\nPremier League relegation:\n1/500 (1/1) Southampton\n1/16 (1/2) Leicester\n1/8 (10/11) Ipswich\n7/1 (7/2) Wolves\n16/1 (12/1) Man City\n66/1 (250/1) Man U\n66/1 (5/2) Everton\n66/1 (20/1) West Ham\n250/1 (250/1) Tottenham\n250/1 (10/1) Palace\n500/1 (7/1) Brentford\n500/1 (40/1) Brighton\n500/1 (200/1) Villa\n650/1 (40/1) Chelsea\n1,000/1 (11/2) Fulham\n1,000/1 (7/1) Bournemouth\n1,000/1 (250/1) Newcastle United\nNo offers (3/1) Forest\nNo offers (2,000/1) Arsenal\nNo offers (2,000/1) Liverpool\nEddie Howe’s team now seen as joint fourth least likely to go down in the 2024/25 season.\nIf you are wondering about the Man City 16/1 odds of relegation, this is due to the possibility (probability?) of severe punishment from the 115 Premier League charges they face, which could include amongst other sanctions, points deduction or even relegation. Still waiting for the outcome of that case.\nFinish Premier League top four:\n1/1,000 (1/2) Liverpool\n1/33 (1/9) Arsenal\n2/5 (1/7) Man City\n11/10 (9/4) Chelsea\n15/8 (9/4) Newcastle United\n9/4 (100/1) Forest\n13/2 (66/1) Bournemouth\n18/1 (11/1) Brighton\n22/1 (7/2) Villa\n66/1 (66/1) Fulham\nThis is where, like me, I guess you will be giving most focus.\nCan Newcastle United bounce back into the Premier League top four and get Champions League football?\nWell, the bookies now have NUFC fifth most likely, following that win over Forest.\nNewcastle United level on points with Man City, Guardiola’s team in fourth now above NUFC, only on goal difference.\nOf the top eight going into this past weekend, only Liverpool and Newcastle United won. The other six lost, four of them playing at home.\nChelsea are on a run of only two wins in their last ten PL games, picking up only nine points from a possible last 30.\nWith it all but guaranteed that fifth place will get a Champions League spot, as things stand, the league table AND the bookies point to Eddie Howe’s side returning to Champions League action next season.\nNewcastle 4 Nottingham Forest 3 – Sunday 23 February 2025 2pm\n(Stats via BBC Sport)\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nMiley 23, Murphy 25, Isak 33 pen, 34\nForest:\nHudson-Odoi 6, Milenkovic 63, Yates 90\nPossession was Newcastle 57% Forest 43%\nTotal shots were Newcastle 13 Forest 17\nShots on target were Newcastle 5 Forest 5\nCorners were Newcastle 7 Forest 6\nTouches in the box Newcastle 34 Forest 26\n(Newcastle 4 Nottingham Forest 3 – Match ratings and comments on all Newcastle United players – Read HERE)\n(Newcastle 4 Nottingham Forest 3 – Instant Newcastle United fan/writer reaction – Read HERE)\n(We love our 4-3s!
