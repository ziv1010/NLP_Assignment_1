  "body_text": "It has not been a good last 10 days in Spain for anyone who would like football and politics not to be mixed in alarming ways.\nThe sorry mess began with comments made by Barcelona president Joan Laporta while he was defending his club’s past payments to former referees chief Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira.\nAdvertisement\nLaporta said he was amazed that Real Madrid had complained, given that: “Madrid was historically favoured in refereeing decisions, it was the team of the regime, close to political, economic and sporting power for 70 years.”\nEveryone listening knew that the “regime” Laporta was referring to was the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco, who ruled Spain from 1939 until his death in 1975.\nReal Madrid felt they had to respond, with the club’s TV station hastily assembling a video that ended with its former president Santiago Bernabeu saying: “Whenever I hear Real Madrid described as ‘the team of the regime’, it makes me want to sh*t on the father of whoever says it.”\nGiven Laporta had just that day made exactly that description, it was quite a message from the current Madrid hierarchy to their Catalan counterparts.\nThis has led to a widespread idea that the relationship between the Clasico rivals has been harmed, possibly beyond repair.\nIn reality there has been no such dramatic fallout among the clubs’ leaders, but the wider picture behind what has happened truly is concerning.\nLaporta’s comments came at the press conference Barcelona called last week to explain the payments totalling over €7million (£6.2m; $7.7m) made between 2001 and 2018 to companies owned by Negreira, who at the time was vice president of Spain’s refereeing committee.\nBarca insist these payments were for legitimate services, with Negreira’s businesses providing the Catalan club with scouting reports and technical information on refereeing. Spanish public prosecutors allege Barca were buying favour from match officials with the aim of influencing results, something the club have strongly denied.\nThe case has drawn huge attention throughout Spanish football and wider society since news prosecutors were investigating first emerged in February.\nAdvertisement\nAs the weeks went by, Laporta and those around him knew that he needed to address the matter. Publicly, Barca kept saying they needed to wait until the conclusion of an internal investigation to do so, which meant two months had passed by the time Laporta finally gave the club’s position.\nGO DEEPER\nBarcelona charged with corruption over payments to former referees chief\nThere was an awareness among the Camp Nou hierarchy that Laporta could not speak openly about the details of the Negreira payments. One reason is that there is a legal process ongoing. UEFA are also investigating and any potential punishment of exclusion from the Champions League would be a huge disaster in both sporting and financial terms.\nSo the messaging was difficult and sensitive. But Laporta did not come up with a nuanced communications strategy. Instead the charismatic former politician used his ability to connect viscerally with his club’s fanbase.\n— Real Madrid C.F. 🇬🇧🇺🇸 (@realmadriden) April 18, 2023\nLaporta first took aim at La Liga president Javier Tebas. He is not popular among Barca fans, and Laporta has blamed him for lots of the club’s problems, including fans’ hero Lionel Messi having to leave the club. So it was an easy way to earn political points.\nEyebrows were further raised — both inside and outside the Camp Nou — by Laporta’s decision to strongly attack Real Madrid, too. Their decision to join the Spanish public prosecutors’ complaint against Barca was described as “an unprecedented show of cynicism” given how they had been historically favoured by referees, he said. This was welcomed by many Blaugrana fans, for whom making such a claim is like saying the sky is blue or water is wet.\nEveryone had expected Laporta to defend the club, and they knew he was in a tight spot. But going so far as to call Madrid “the club of the regime”, bringing Franco into the conversation, caused surprise, even among his colleagues in the senior hierarchy.\nAdvertisement\nEver since the Negreira scandal broke, Real Madrid had been remarkably restrained in their response. They released no official reaction when news first emerged, and kept silent when the other 18 La Liga clubs put their names to a statement “condemning the facts known so far”.\nThat was politically awkward for the Bernabeu hierarchy, given their supporters locally and internationally were at least as upset as their counterparts at the other clubs. This was best symbolised by the mock €500 banknotes bearing Laporta’s face that fans distributed during a protest before a Copa del Rey Clasico at the Bernabeu in early March.\n🚩\nDemonstration at the Santiago Bernabéu to protest the Negreira case.

This was seen as an attack on them which was both historically inaccurate and politically unacceptable.\nWithin an hour of Laporta’s press conference finishing, staff at Real Madrid TV were told to prepare a response. The word came from the very highest levels of the club, as no big decisions are taken without the nod from Perez and his very closest advisors.\nSome Madrid fans and club employees are very uncomfortable with the idea of their club as a symbol of the dictatorship. Real’s stadium was destroyed during Spain’s Civil War, and many of the club’s officials and players died while fighting on the Republican side.\nGO DEEPER\nReal Madrid's Barcelona video: Franco and 'team of the regime' claims explained\nStill, the four-minute video that was hastily assembled on Monday afternoon was not really that concerned with historical accuracy. It was about hitting back at Laporta, hence the choice of archive clips apparently showing Franco meeting with Barca officials and a Catholic bishop blessing the Camp Nou.\nAdvertisement\nThat Madrid wanted the video to be seen by as many people as possible was clear — it was shared to millions of social media followers in both Spanish and English. A number of former players reposted it — including former Spain internationals Alvaro Arbeloa and Iker Casillas, both now back at the club as a youth coach and official ambassador respectively.\nThere was also delight among many Madrid fans — in the city and around the world — at what was seen as a necessary defence of their side.\nWhile passions on both sides were being inflamed, the two clubs carried on with their working weeks. Madrid eliminated Chelsea from the Champions League, as expected, and Barca’s president travelled to the Spanish capital to continue to represent his club’s interests.\nOn Wednesday, Laporta attended the National (Spanish) Sports Awards ceremony, held at the Palacio del Pardo, which was Franco’s official residence during the dictatorship.\nThis was to accompany Barca’s Alexia Putellas, winner of the Queen Letizia Prize, for the best Spanish female athlete of 2021, when she won the Ballon d’Or. Laporta sat in the second row at the ceremony, standing as Spain’s King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia arrived to hand out the awards, as protocol requires.\nAlso present were the Spanish government’s minister of culture, Miquel Iceta, and the president of the Superior Sports Council, Jose Manuel Franco. None of the politicians or sports people present made any mention of the Negreira scandal, Laporta’s speech two days earlier, or Madrid’s video reaction.\nLaporta did not stick around for any small talk, as he had another date across town that day, at La Liga’s headquarters. An assembly of all Primera and Segunda Division clubs had been called to discuss Barca’s payments to Negreira.\nRecently, Barca have not been sending any official representation to such meetings, while Madrid have also been boycotting events. Instead, the Clasico duo have sent a legal proxy to represent them both, who, not coincidentally, was also a lawyer working for the Super League.\nBut Laporta was aware of huge consternation and deep upset among most other La Liga clubs, and at the Camp Nou it was felt necessary to go in person.\nAdvertisement\nGiven that, in the last months, both Laporta and Tebas had both called for the other to resign, some coolness might have been expected in the atmosphere. But there were smiles as the Barca president entered and strode across to greet the La Liga chief, with whom he had a short, amiable chat.\nMadrid president Florentino Perez did not attend but Los Blancos’ director general Jose Angel Sanchez made the 10-minute drive from Madrid’s offices at Valdebebas instead. Laporta also amiably greeted Sanchez, and they were seated close together around La Liga’s big table, with Espanyol CEO Mao Ye sat slightly awkwardly between them.\nLaporta made a 20-minute presentation, which was similar in detail to the defence he had given the media two days earlier, arguing that many clubs had former referees on their payroll, and Barca’s payments to Negreira were not really that strange or unusual. But his tone was much less combative and more conciliatory, and there was no reference made to Madrid, Tebas, or to the “regime”.\nAbout a dozen representatives from Primera and Segunda clubs responded to Laporta’s speech, none in support. Atletico Madrid’s Gil Marin, in his role as La Liga vice-president, had the longest intervention, telling Laporta he just did not understand the supposed explanation.\n“We’re not fools,” said another club president, who stands firmly with Tebas in all his battles against the Clasico duo. Sanchez remained quiet on this issue but just his mere presence worked in tacit support of Laporta — his ally in so many recent conflicts with La Liga.\nGO DEEPER\nBarcelona and Real Madrid, hated rivals who need each other more than ever\nNeither Laporta nor Sanchez made any comment to reporters as they left, leaving it to Tebas to hold forth in a press conference. He said he had not been convinced at all by Barca’s explanation of the Negreira payments, and nor was he concerned by Perez not attending. He said he still thought Laporta should resign, but also recalled having had a fun afternoon with him at the Singapore Grand Prix a few years back.\nAsked whether he believed that Madrid or Barca had been the real “team of the regime”, Tebas said he did not agree with either Laporta’s words or the Real Madrid TV video. Then he said what he felt had been the real motivation for both.\nAdvertisement\n“With maximum respect to everyone, I remembered when I was 19 or 20, and I had these types of arguments with my friends, until 5AM,” he said. “It is a debate to distract attention from what else is happening.”\nThe week ended back at the Camp Nou on Sunday afternoon, with Barcelona hosting Atletico Madrid in a La Liga game that had its own political and cultural edge.\nSunday was the day of Sant Jordi, the patron saint of Catalonia (also known as Saint George and celebrated in other countries from England to Ethiopia and from Bulgaria to Brazil). Barca marked the occasion by bathing their home ground in the red and yellow colours of the Catalan flag before kick-off.\nThe pre-match message “Comparteix el Catala” (Share Catalan) was organised in association with Omnium, an NGO that promotes Catalan cultural and political causes. Its website says it was “founded at the height of the 40-year Franco dictatorship on 11 July 1961… to combat the censorship and persecution of Catalan culture”.\nOmnium’s former president is Jordi Cuixart, who was sentenced in 2019 to serve nine years in prison for his role in pro-independence demonstrations two years earlier, and then pardoned by the current left-leaning Spanish government in July 2021.\nUna tarde de Sant Jordi en el Spotify Camp Nou#LaLigaHighlights pic.twitter.com/e4DUkHd1t2\n— FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona_es) April 25, 2023\nSuch a mix of football and politics is very common at the Camp Nou, where fans at every game chant “independencia” after exactly 17 minutes and 14 seconds in every game, referencing when Spanish troops entered the Catalan capital in 1714. These chants have been particularly vehement during Clasicos over the last decade, as nationalist voices in both Barcelona and Madrid have become louder.\nThe crowd got even noisier after some decisions by referee Jose Maria Sanchez Martinez, which the home fans felt had gone Atletico’s way. That led to chants of ‘Tebas go now’, from the 800-strong club-organised Espai d’animacio behind the north goal, followed by “Madridista son of a b*tch”, presumably at the Murcian official. A chorus of “F*ck Spain” also rang out.\nGO DEEPER\nHow Barcelona sees the Negreira scandal: Shame, disbelief and rallying cries\nSuch chants are not unusual at games in the Camp Nou, especially when the visiting team comes from Madrid. What was unusual about Sunday’s game was an altercation after a Spanish flag with an Atletico badge was draped over an advertising hoarding. Another supporter approached and forcibly removed the flag, leading to an argument.\nAdvertisement\nSecurity staff quickly intervened and the two Atletico fans left their seats, before returning without the flag and having taken off their rojiblanco jerseys. Barca later said the flag had been removed as covering sponsorship hoardings was not allowed at the stadium. Their club statement also said that the two Atletico supporters were Polish, and claimed one had been drinking.\nAfter Ferran Torres scored the only goal of the game, the second half passed without any incident. Still, the open conflict between fans was very different from the cordial pre-game meeting between Laporta and his Atletico counterpart Enrique Cerezo. Atletico CEO Gil Marin might have backed Tebas’ position 100 per cent at the La Liga meeting in Madrid, but it was all smiles as Cerezo and Laporta met for a formal meal at Real Club de Tenis de Barcelona, which was hosting its annual Godo tournament.\n📸Las fotografías de la comida de directivas entre el Barça y el Atlético de Madrid en el Godó con Laporta y Cerezo a la cabeza\n📷@rctb1899 #fcblive pic.twitter.com/DK4oXRDaqb\n— Víctor Navarro (@victor_nahe) April 23, 2023\nLaporta had also been at the royal tennis club the previous day. TV cameras caught another patron saying “stop buying referees, Jan” (in Catalan), to which Laporta replied: “I don’t buy referees, Barca do not buy referees.”\nWhen the other asked, “So it’s all a swindle by Madrid?” Laporta replied: “It’s a manipulation.”\nThere is definitely some manipulation going on, on all sides. The events of the last 10 days might seem to fit into a narrative that Real Madrid and Barcelona are two historic rivals who completely hate each other and everything they stand for.\nBut, as The Athletic has explained recently, this is not really the case. The two Clasico clubs are historically quite similar, and have been drawn even closer together recently by common causes like the European Super League and shared enemies including Tebas and UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin.\nAnother thing that both Madrid and Barcelona have in common is that they are deeply political, as well as sporting, institutions. It is no coincidence that both their presidents have made failed attempts to become actual politicians.\nAdvertisement\nAfter his first term as Blaugrana chief ended in 2010, Laporta founded a new party called Democracia Catalana and was elected as a deputy to the regional parliament, but his coalition won just 3 per cent of the total vote and he quickly lost interest.\nPerez is now a construction magnate and one of Spain’s richest men, but he only turned to business after failing in a bid to be elected to the Spanish parliament in 1986, when he represented the very conservative Partido Reformista Democratico (PRD).\nAs the historical debate between their clubs heated up last week, current politicians in both the Catalan and Spanish capitals saw a need (or an opportunity) to get involved.\nCatalonia’s regional government spokesperson, Patricia Plaja, called the RMTV video a “crude manipulation of history” and “an insult to the thousands of people who suffered Franco’s regime, also FC Barcelona, starting with the president at the time, Josep Sunyol, who was executed by the regime, which maybe Real Madrid don’t remember”.\nMadrid regional president Isabel Diaz Ayuso, a Los Blancos fan who is often photographed with Perez, unsurprisingly had a completely opposite position.\n“It was a magnificent, fantastic video by Real Madrid,” she told EsRadio. “(Barca’s behaviour) is a metaphor which makes you realise what this nationalism is really about. You start a racket, you get caught, then you play the victim, and they pull out the ‘Franco-joker’. This nationalism makes the hate stronger than the truth.”\nPlaja and Ayuso were playing to their increasingly radicalised audiences; voters in Catalonia and Madrid. Both saw political advantages in referring back to Spain’s Civil War from 1936-39, and in enthusing their own supporters while attacking those on the other side.\nNeither seemed to remember that half a million people died during that extremely bloody civil war, then the whole country suffered an immensely cruel dictatorship for four decades, while political violence and civil strife have continued during the current democratic regime.\nAnd neither did Laporta nor Perez seem to be too worried about those deeper issues last week.\nAdvertisement\nSome at Barca believe that Laporta has won a victory. Conversations about Negreira are very awkward, but if the debate is on Franco and the history books, Barca feel very comfortable defending themselves.\nThe Madrid hierarchy can also show their fans that the video succeeded in being a very public and powerful defence of Los Blancos’ reputation, which has not harmed any of their private interests.\nSo last week’s arguments were not really about history, but about public relations and realpolitik. Both Laporta and Perez might feel pleased with how it has all played out. But nobody has come out of it looking any better.\n(Top photo: Eric Alonso/Getty Images, Alex Grimm/Getty Images.
