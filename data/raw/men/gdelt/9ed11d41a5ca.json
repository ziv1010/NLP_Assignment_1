It starts with a group stage, with teams eventually progressing to the quarter-finals. Clubs competing in the Champions League group stage also get a bye straight to the knockouts.\nOnly three clubs have ever lifted the Conti Cup in its history to date - Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea. Arsenal are the record winners with five triumphs, with City winning it four times and Chelsea twice. Bristol City are the only team outside those three to have even reached any of the last six finals - that includes the 2022/23 edition between Chelsea and Arsenal.\nManchester City were the holders coming into 2022/23 after beating Chelsea in last season's final.\nWhen did the 2022/23 Conti Cup start?\nThe 2022/23 Conti Cup kicked off with the start of the group stage on 2 October. Games were scheduled throughout October, November and December, with the final matches originally intended to take place on 18 December. But postponements saw the opening phase continue until 18 January.\nConti Cup 2022/23 group stage\nIn the Conti Cup group stage, each teams play every other in their group only once - home or away. There are three points for a win as normal, but games that are drawn are decided by a penalty shootout, for which an extra bonus point is available.\nThis season, each of the five group winners progressed automatically to the next round, followed by the best overall runner-up. Chelsea and Arsenal did not compete in the group stage due to Champions League commitments in the first half of the season.\nOf the five group runners-up, the highest ranked also progressed to the knockout rounds. However, due to not all group being the same size, those teams were ordered on a points per game basis.\nGroup A\n- Aston Villa 1-1 Manchester United (Aston Villa won 4-3 on penalties)\n- Durham 3-3 Sheffield United (Durham won 5-3 on penalties)\n- Everton 1-1 Aston Villa (Everton won 4-2 on penalties)\n- Durham 2-2 Manchester United (Durham won 3-1 on penalites)\n- Sheffield United 0-3 Everton\n- Aston Villa 1-0 Durham\n- Manchester United 4-2 Everton\n- Sheffield United 1-2 Everton\n- Everton 0-1 Durham\n- Manchester United 4-0 Sheffield United\nGroup B\n- Sunderland 0-1 Liverpool\n- Blackburn 0-3 Leicester\n- Leicester 0-4 Liverpool\n- Manchester City 6-0 Blackburn\n- Manchester City 3-0 Sunderland\n- Liverpool1-0 Blackburn\n- Liverpool 0-2 Manchester City\n- Sunderland 0-5 Leicester\n- Leicester 0-1 Manchester City\n- Blackburn vs Sunderland (cancelled)\nThe final fixture between Blackburn and Sunderland was postponed twice due to a frozen pitch and was later cancelled altogether as the result would not have affected the group outcome.\nGroup C\n- Birmingham 3-2 Brighton\n- London City Lionesses 2-2 West Ham (West Ham won 10-9 on penalties)\n- London City Lionesses 1-2 Brighton\n- West Ham 2-0 Birmingham\n- Birmingham 1-2 London City Lionesses\n- Brighton 0-0 West Ham (Brighton won 3-0 on penalties)\nGroup D\n- Lewes 2-0 Charlton\n- Bristol City 4-0 Crystal Palace\n- Crystal Palace 1-4 Lewes\n- Charlton 2-1 Bristol City\n- Charlton 2-0 Crystal Palace\n- Lewes 0-1 Bristol City\nGroup E\n- Reading 1-2 Tottenham\n- Coventry United 2-0 Southampton\n- Southampton 0-3 Reading\n- Tottenham 5-1 Coventry United\n- Coventry United 0-4 Reading\n- Southampton 0-1 Tottenham\nRanking second place teams\nConti Cup 2022/23 quarter-finals\nThe 2022/23 quarter-finals were all played in late January, a week after the last of the delayed group games had been completed. Chelsea and Arsenal also joined the competition at this stage.\n- 25 January 2023 - Bristol City 0-6 Manchester City\n- 25 January 2023 - Liverpool 0-1 West Ham\n- 25 January 2023 - Tottenham 1-3 Chelsea\n- 26 January 2023 - Arsenal 3-0 Aston Villa\nConti Cup 2022/23 semi-finals\nThe final four of the 2022/23 Conti Cup played their semi-final ties in the second week into February, with all of the dominant big three making it this far.\n- 8 February 2023 - Arsenal 1-0 Manchester City (aet)\n- 9 February 2023 - West Ham 0-7 Chelsea\nConti Cup 2022/23 final\nThe 2022/23 Conti Cup final was played at Selhurst Park on 5 March 2023 and smashed the previous record attendance for a final in the competition after all available tickets were snapped up.\n- 5 March 2023 - Chelsea 1-3 Arsenal",
