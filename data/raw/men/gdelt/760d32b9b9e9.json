  "body_text": "Former Manchester United defender Phil Jones has named a Chelsea legend as his ‘toughest opponent’, admitting he ‘couldn’t play against him’.\nJones came up against some of the best Premier League players of his generation during his 12-year spell at Old Trafford.\nWhile Jones failed to live up to the hype at United – having been tipped to become a club legend by Sir Alex Ferguson – the defender still made over 200 appearances for the Red Devils and was part of the last team to win the Premier League.\nGiven the England defender was a mainstay at United for over a decade, he is well-placed to give his take on the best players of his generation.\nAsked who he rates as his ‘toughest opponent’, the Manchester United cult hero told MUTV: ‘I’ve said on the podcast, I couldn’t play against Eden Hazard.\n‘He had that season, a couple of seasons, where he was just unplayable. Low centre of gravity, you would try to close him down, try to nail him, and he just twisted me up!’\nHazard established himself as a Chelsea great during his seven-year spell at Stamford Bridge, winning two Premier League titles, two Europa Leagues, the FA Cup and Carabao Cup in west London.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

I went to Manchester to see the Man City training ground.\n‘So I had a few options, but not Chelsea because the last year in Lille, Chelsea in the league was not that good. You know when you [John Obi Mikel] won the Champions League, in the league you were like sixth or seventh, I don’t remember.\nMore Trending\n‘I knew I was leaving France to go to the Premier League but not Chelsea, because I wanted to play in the Champions League, you know? So that move came because you won the Champions League.’\nAfter leaving Chelsea, Hazard had an underwhelming four-year spell at Real Madrid before retiring in 2023 at the age of 32.\nExplaining a retirement that many saw as premature, Hazard said: ‘You must listen to yourself and say stop at the right time.\n‘After 16 years and more than 700 matches played, I have decided to end my career as a professional footballer.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: ‘Signing of the season’ – Man City urged to make surprise transfer bid to sign former Chelsea star\nMORE: Chris Richards injury update ahead of Crystal Palace vs Fulham\nMORE: Dan Ballard injury update ahead of Sunderland vs Man City",
