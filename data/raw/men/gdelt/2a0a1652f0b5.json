  "body_text": "AC Milan and Inter Milan are in unfamiliar territory.\nNeither has reached the Champions League semi-final since they won the competition in 2007 and 2010 respectively, but that is now where they will face each other in a Derby della Madonnina. Meanwhile in Serie A just two points separate Inter (63) in fourth and Milan (61) in fifth as they fight for a top-four spot.\nAdvertisement\nWednesday night’s European clash comes 20 years after they faced each other in the semi-final of the 2002-03 Champions League — the Rossoneri came out on top via the away goals rule — and it will be the fourth and fifth meetings between the sides this season, the most times they have faced each other in a single campaign.\nMark Carey and Liam Tharme pick out the key statistics and tactical trends ahead of the tie…\nAC Milan\nWhile this season’s progress in Europe is better than their previous 15 campaigns, Milan’s season has been mixed. Stefano Pioli’s side arrive at the semi-final with a weaker team than last season’s Scudetto-winning campaign.\nThis is reflected by FiveThirtyEight’s Soccer Power Index (SPI), which estimates a team’s overall strength between zero and 100 using difficulty-adjusted match results and underlying performance metrics to model a team’s offensive and defensive strength.\nMilan’s peak under Pioli was at the start of the 2020-21 season, when the Rossoneri lost just once in their first 24 games in all competitions, but the post-World Cup slide this season was sharp, as they went seven games in all competitions at the turn of the year without a win.\nMilan have experienced a second wind in recent weeks though — the result of a tactical tweak. Pioli had almost exclusively played a 4-2-3-1 until the end of January, when Milan’s form had dropped off a cliff, including a 3-0 Supercoppa final loss against Inter, when they were continuously overloaded by their rival’s advancing wing-backs.\n“The things that worked up until a few weeks ago are not working, so it’s clear there will be some changes,” said Piolo after the 5-2 loss at home to Sassuolo on January 29. “It would be foolish on my part to carry on down a path that isn’t getting results.”\nMilan adapted to a 3-4-2-1, and while they had injuries to contend with (first-choice goalkeeper Mike Maignan, Fikayo Tomori, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Alessandro Florenzi), Milan stemmed a flow of 18 goals conceded in their first seven restart games, during which they had failed to keep a clean sheet.\nAdvertisement\nMilan won four and drew twice in their next eight, though that included a 1-0 defeat against Inter, one of just four goals they conceded in that time, with five clean sheets, including in both round of 16 Champions League legs against Tottenham.\nGO DEEPER\nMilan show Spurs the value of pragmatism and being tactically flexible\nThat said, when in possession, Milan rotated to attack as a 4-3-3 with right wing-back Alexis Saelemaekers pushing on (out of shot) into a winger role, right centre-back Pierre Kalulu providing the width on the right, and Rafael Leao playing inside close to Olivier Giroud.\nWhen faced with three fixtures against Serie A champions Napoli, Piolo tweaked back to the 4-2-3-1 to balance Napoli’s 4-3-3. Though with Brahim Diaz and Leao as the ‘wingers’, they attack lopsidedly and are reliant on the excellent, complementary Leao and Theo Hernandez (left-back) pairing to penetrate opponents.\nTwo wins — including 4-0 at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona — and a draw was an excellent return, highlighting the strength of the system and adaptability. Milan conceded once in two Champions League quarter-final legs against Napoli — in second-half injury time of the return leg, which they won 2-1 on aggregate.\nTransition, Leao, and Milan’s left side\nOne of Milan’s key strengths is their transitional, counter-attacking threat.\nNone of the quarter-finalists had registered more than Milan’s 42 direct attacks — a possession that starts in a team’s defensive half and ends in a shot or touch inside the opposition box within 15 seconds — in the UCL this season, which highlights how much they look to spring forward upon regaining the ball.\nNo player encapsulates Milan’s direct style of play better than their Portuguese speedster, Leao, who at the time of writing was still an injury doubt for the semi-final, even though the player downplayed concerns.\nHis sensational assist for Giroud in Milan’s quarter-final clash with Napoli was exactly what he is about: driving forward with the ball at his feet, drawing players towards him and instilling panic in the opponent’s back line.\nGiroud wasn't going to miss that one!\nLeão with one of the best solo runs you will ever see 😍#UCL pic.twitter.com/W4i9QLFnb2\n— Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) April 18, 2023\nLeao’s 3.7 carries into the final third per 90 places him in the top five per cent of wide players in Serie A this season, with his progressive carry distance of 140 yards per 90 also one of the highest among his peers in Italy.\nAdvertisement\nIn the Champions League, only Real Madrid’s Vinicius Junior (99) has attempted more take-ons than Leao’s 76, with the 23-year-old’s 19 attacking runs — which are chance-creating and shot-creating carries — being the fourth highest in the competition this season.\nWhen Leao turns up the heat, very few players can handle him.\nHowever, his next task is to maintain a level of consistency that matches his talent. While Leao is Milan’s top goalscorer in Serie A, his own dip in form saw him go 11 games without scoring before bagging two goals in Milan’s 4-0 battering of Napoli in April.\nGO DEEPER\nHow Rafael Leao harnesses chaos to create footballing beauty\nLeao is the man that Milan turn to for creativity. His 14 open-play chances created — and 2.7 expected assists — are comfortably higher than anyone else in the Rossoneri squad in Europe, with his direct running into the lucrative half-space providing the most potent element of Pioli’s attack in this year’s competition.\nOf course, to solely attribute Milan’s left-side threat to Leao would be wrongly overlooking Hernandez’s contribution — he plays a similar supporting role internationally for France, behind Kylian Mbappe.\nAt times, Leao and Hernandez will switch positions but frequently play one-twos to get around opponents and into situations where they can switch play and attempt line-breaks, or get Leao driving at defences.\nThis was evident within five minutes of the quarter-final first leg at home to Napoli. Milan’s central midfielders (yellow dots) move fluidly, but Diaz’s narrowness off the right requires right-back Davide Calabria to advance to maintain balance, hence why most of Milan’s best attacks are down the Leao/Hernandez side.\nWith a simple one-two, Hernandez has bypassed the Napoli midfield and, through Diaz, the ball can be switched to Calabria, who has a cross cleared.\nLeao (823) and Hernandez (768) are second and third for Milan in European minutes played behind Sandro Tonali (873) and are, unsurprisingly, also the top two for final third touches (Leao, 213; Hernandez, 127).\nAdvertisement\nHaving been dropped to the bench for Milan’s last meeting with Inter in February, you can be certain that Leao will be hoping to make up for lost time in the biggest Derby della Madonnina of his career — if he’s fit.\nWill they go back three/five or back four?\nHow inclined Milan are to match up with their rivals depends on their desire to control the game. Possession was equally balanced (47/53 per cent) in the 3-2 Milan win in August, but they ended up with 66 per cent of the ball in Riyadh when Inter flew out of the traps and won 3-0 to clinch the Supercoppa.\nThey had just 36 per cent possession and tried a 3-5-2 in early February, losing 1-0 against Inter courtesy of a Lautaro Martinez header from a corner — their best of the three meetings this season in terms of a defensive performance.\n“We decided to defend a little bit deeper,” he said, feeling that Milan “clearly improved (…) in terms of solidity, attention and compactness.”\nAgainst Napoli, they defended in a 4-1-4-1 with man-marking.\n“We’ve tried both formations (back three and back four), we’ll choose the best one,” Pioli said before the 4-0 league win away to Napoli last month.\nIt is a real string to Milan’s bow, particularly in knockout competitions, that they can be so tactically adaptable. Piolo’s side have won 16 of the 18 league games and five of the six Champions League games when taking the lead this season, drawing the others. They are capable of sitting deep and hitting teams on the break.\nInter Milan\nPsychologically, Inter might have the upper hand in this Derby della Madonnina, having beaten Milan in two of their three meetings this season and are currently sitting two points ahead of them in the Serie A table.\nThey also won the Supercoppa last season, as well as the Italian Cup, beating Milan in the semi-finals and keeping clean sheets in both legs. It is a tournament they are in the final of this season.\nInter’s style is clear and contrasts with Milan’s. Inzaghi religiously plays a 3-5-2 — defending as a 5-3-2 — with his side having registered the most open-play crosses of any of this season’s quarter-finalists (143), logging just nine through balls across the competition. It’s comfortably the fewest among the cohort.\nMilan’s back four could not handle Inter’s wing-backs in the Supercoppa, evidenced by the opening goal.\nAdvertisement\nMatteo Darmian finds the feet of Edin Dzeko, who slides through on-running central midfielder Nicolo Barella.\nBarella squares it to left wing-back Federico Dimarco for the simplest of finishes.\nInter’s left flank has typically been more potent in Europe this season, channelling 38 per cent of their attacking touches down that third of the pitch, compared with 33 per cent down the right.\nCreatively, left wing-back Dimarco (four) and, interestingly, left centre-back Alessandro Bastoni (three) lead Inter’s assist count in this season’s Champions League.\nBastoni, an outside centre-back, showed his adventurousness and crossing quality in the last round against Benfica, driving forward after receiving a pass and delivering from deep.\nInter typically push both wing-backs forward, often making a front five when central midfielder Barella makes a trademark forward run, with Bastoni picking him out to open the scoring in the tie, with the pair combining similarly against Barcelona in the group stages.\nWhile Dimarco has shared his minutes at left wing-back with Robin Gosens, the Italian’s 33 open-play crosses in the Champions League is the highest among his team-mates this season, with no Inter player logging a higher expected assists total than the 25-year-old — highlighting how much threat has come from Inter’s left flank.\nDimarco’s remit as left wing-back is different from Denzel Dumfries on the right side, with the Italian far more likely to be involved in Inter’s attacking phase with neat interplay and crosses from wide.\nIn the second leg against Benfica, Dumfries starts the move for the second goal with a throw-in switch to Bastoni, who plays wide to Dimarco.\nDimarco and Henrikh Mkhitaryan combine, with the wing-back underlapping.\nAnd he finds Lautaro with a cutback to extend Inter’s lead, but again note the four Inter players attacking the ball, including Barella and wing-back Dumfries.\nBy contrast, Dumfries’ qualities lend themselves more to off-ball runs and providing an aerial threat in advanced areas to pin the opposition full-backs into their defensive third. Each flank brings its own strengths, and width is likely to be crucial to Inter’s approach across both legs.\nAdvertisement\nInzaghi’s selection dilemma at right wing-back will perhaps be more focused on defence than anything else, with Hernandez and Leao attacking that flank. The Inter manager opted for Darmian in two of the three meetings this season, with Dumfries’ only start against Milan being the 3-2 Serie A loss.\nLautaro and Dzeko or Lukaku?\nRomelu Lukaku will possibly play a decisive one in this tie, having made just five appearances in all competitions pre-World Cup. He has four goals and four assists in Serie A since the restart and scored in each of the last two Champions League rounds.\n“Romelu likes to play more between the opposition defenders to turn them, while I like to seek the space between the lines,” said Inter captain Lautaro when asked about the difference between Lukaku and Dzeko’s styles.\n“With Edin, we keep a close eye on each other and adjust depending on the situation. I am learning a lot from both of them.”\nLautaro and Dzeko have been the starting pair in the Champions League this season, lining up together in seven of the 10 games.\nRegardless of the partnership, the idea that Lautaro is solely the ‘little man’ in an old-fashioned front two is far from the truth — Inter rely on his back-to-goal play, particularly as an outlet in transition, and Dzeko is a strong runner of the channels too, as Inter’s second and third goals against Milan in the Supercoppa showed in January.\nOnana’s brilliance\nAt the other end of the field, Inter’s shot-stopper Andre Onana has been particularly impressive across his 10 games played in Europe.\nTo succeed in any cup competition, you need a degree of overperformance along the way, and Onana’s “goals prevented” rate is the most of any goalkeeper in the Champions League, saving 6.7 goals above expectation based on the quality of shots he has faced.\nAs shown by the graphic above, Onana has been particularly strong with reaching low to his right side — most memorably making a crucial double save during Inter’s last-16 clash with Porto, keeping a clean sheet to help his side progress when the margins were tight.\nThis will be a poignant Champions League semi-final, played out at a San Siro about to be redeveloped in a city with 10 European Cups/Champions League trophies between them — seven for Milan and three for Inter.\nAdvertisement\nOnly one of them can reach the final, and it is worth reminding ourselves that Inter navigated a “group of death” containing Bayern Munich and Barcelona to reach the knockout stage, before dispatching Porto and Benfica, the strongest two teams in Portugal.\nBut any side that reaches the semi-final of the Champions League is there on merit.\nGO DEEPER\nInter were made from AC Milan.
