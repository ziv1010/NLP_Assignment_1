The press worked a dream.\nEveryone in a black and white shirt played well, most notably Schar, Gordon, Anderson, Barnes and Isak.\nCan we play Tottenham every week!\nTightrope walk’s over\nIt’s quite incredible how many games that Bruno was on nine bookings for.\nHe was one away from a two match ban and has put in an astonishing level of discipline to avoid further trouble.\nWhen Howe subbed him off late on, he’d reached 32 games and had made it safely to the yellow card amnesty, averting the two game ban hanging over him.\nHe’s now all clear for the rest of the season. It’s an amazing effort. Well done, Bruno.\nNot only that but he’s still played really well while on the nine yellows. His passes for the Isak goals were pinpoint perfection. It goes more unnoticed outside of Newcastle as we’re less of a media darling club.\nHot property\nIf any player needed singling out then it was Alexander Isak. A goal machine.\nIt was a brace from the in-form Swedish striker, who is attracting some envious eyes with his performances this season.\nHe blew Spurs away. Crisp and clever finishing, allied to excellent movement, pace and fitness.\nIt took his tally for the season to 21 in all competitions, just a few back from Haaland. Some in the media already saying he’s the best forward in the Premier League.\nIf he can keep this going then we can get European football.\nIt’s also clear his transfer value is north of £100m and he ought not to be sold any time soon.\nNegatives (not many)\nStat attack\nThe win was achieved with just 27% possession. That’s a bit Rafa Benitez era! It would be nice to have a bit more of the ball at home than that.\nHandbags\nSome of the Spurs players were sore losers at full time and it’s not nice to see that going on.\nLo Celso was having a beef with Bruno and the odious Romero appeared to be restrained from having a square off with Elliot Anderson.\nJames Maddison was loathsome during the game too. At least on this occasion he didn’t get the chance to do his dart throwing goal celebration and had to stick with throwing his toys out the pram instead.\nDeath to 12.30 kick offs\nAnyone else fed up if we get the 12.30pm kick off slot?\nIt’s such a pain starting then.\nThe broadcasters really need to get rid of it and just do away with the 3pm blackout.\nStats via BBC Sport:\nNewcastle 4 Tottenham 0 – Saturday 13 April 12.30pm\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nIsak 30, 51, Gordon 32, Schar 87\nTottenham:\n(Half-time stats in brackets)\nPossession was Tottenham 73% (66%) Newcastle 27% (34%)\nTotal shots were Tottenham 11 (5) Newcastle 18 (10)\nShots on target were Tottenham 2 (1) Newcastle 5 (2)\nCorners were Tottenham 3 (1) Newcastle 16 (10)\nReferee: Tim Robinson\nNewcastle team v Tottenham:\nDubravka, J Murphy (Livramento 78), Krafth, Schar (Dummett 90+3), Burn, Longstaff, Bruno (White 90+3), Anderson (Ritchie 89), Gordon, Barnes (Hall 88), Isak\nUnused subs:\nKarius, Gillespie, A Murphy, Parkinson\n(Match Report – Tottenham Hotspur, it’s happening again – Read HERE)\n(BBC Sport comments from ‘neutrals’ – Very interesting on Newcastle after 4-0 Spurs hammering – Read HERE)\n(Ange Postecoglou deserves credit – Very honest after Newcastle United outclass Tottenham – Read HERE)\n(Newcastle 4 Tottenham 0 – Instant Newcastle United fan / writer reaction – Read HERE)\n(Can we play you every week(***) – Newcastle 4 Tottenham 0 – Read HERE)\nNewcastle United matches now confirmed for rest of the season:\nWednesday 24 April 2024 – Crystal Palace v Newcastle (8pm)\nSaturday 27 April 2024 – Newcastle v Sheff Utd (3pm)\nSaturday 4 May 2024 – Burnley v Newcastle (3pm)\nSaturday 11 May 2024 – Newcastle v Brighton (3pm)\nWednesday 15 May 2024 – Man U v Newcastle (8pm) Sky Sports\nSunday 19 May 2024 – Brentford v Newcastle (4pm)\n(The final day of the season live TV matches will be selected closer to the day but all 10 PL games will be same time same day)\nWednesday 22 May 2024 – Tottenham v Newcastle (at MCG – Melbourne Cricket Ground)\nFriday 24 May 2024 – A-League All Stars team v Newcastle (at Marvel Stadium, Melbourne)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
