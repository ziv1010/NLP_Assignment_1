Hopefully we'll be at our best. They're going to demand a lot from us.\"\nThe victory in Paris was Barca's first win in the Champions League knockout stage in four years and left them full of confidence as they reached six consecutive victories in all competitions.\nThey are unbeaten since losing 5-3 at home to Villarreal in La Liga in January that led to Xavi announcing he was stepping down as manager at the end of what then looked like a difficult season.\nNow, 13 competitive games without a loss later, including a commanding performance in the French capital to end PSG's 27-game unbeaten run, Tuesday's challenge seems to have presented itself at the perfect time.\n\"Happy to be where we are, proud to be where we are. I think it's a good moment and I'm excited. We feel it already,\" Xavi said.\n\"We have to control our emotions, our temperament... It's a game of heads or tails. We want to be in control with the ball, and we want to show the best side and personality of the team.\n\"We need our fans to be loud because PSG will make us suffer, there's no doubt about it, and we have to be a team to beat them. All of us, together.\"\nALSO READ:\n- Sheikh Mansour hails Shabab Al Ahli's Qatar-UAE Super Shield triumph\n- Arteta tells Arsenal to show 'character' after title blow\n- Klopp farewell tour fizzling out as Liverpool struggle to keep up momentum\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
