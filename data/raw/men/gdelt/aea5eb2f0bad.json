  "body_text": "Premier League signings of the 2024 summer transfer window so far - ranked\n- The best signings of the summer so far\n- Man Utd have made a number of shrewd signings\n- Riccardo Calafiori has been the big signing for Arsenal\nAfter a quiet first few weeks of the 2024 summer transfer window for Premier League clubs, business has really picked up leading to the new season kicking off.\nBar Liverpool, every single club in the Premier League has done some form of business heading into the 2024/25 campaign, with some clubs (*ahem* Chelsea) being busier than others.\nSo, with the new campaign kicking off this weekend, which Premier League clubs have made the best signings of the summer so far?\nWe at 90min have taken a look.\n20. Estevao\nTransfer: Palmeiras to Chelsea\nFee: £51m\nThe sole reason this transfer is so low on this list is because Estevao won't actually be joining Chelsea until next summer.\nWhen does, expect him to become a genuine superstar in the Premier League.\n19. Jake O'Brien\nTransfer: Olympique Lyonnais to Everton\nFee: £16.4m\nJake O'Brien's move to Everton seems like a pretty perfect one for all parties.\nHaving impressed at Lyon last season, O'Brien can be expected to form a pretty exciting young partnership with Jarrad Branthwaite at the heart of the Toffees defence. The defender himself will learn a lot working under Sean Dyche too.\n18. Dean Huijsen\nTransfer: Juventus to Bournemouth\nFee: £15.8m\nQuite the coup this.\nDean Huijsen has been one of the most exciting young defenders in Italy for last few seasons, so it was a bit of a shock that he ended up at Bournemouth this summer.\nSerie A's loss is most certainly the Cherries' gain.\nExpect to see Huijsen catch the eye with his ability on the ball throughout the 2024/25 season.\n17. Emile Smith Rowe\nTransfer: Arsenal to Fulham\nFee: £27m\nEmile Smith Rowe is an outrageously talented footballer who has simply had a tough break with injuries in recent years.\nIf he can stay fit, he'll be a huge asset to Fulham.\n16. Omari Hutchinson\nTransfer: Chelsea to Ipswich Town\nFee: £22.5m\nThere was one bit of business Ipswich Town absolutely had to do this summer, and it was sign Omari Hutchinson on a permanent deal.\nAnd they've done exactly that.\nNice one.\n15. Crysencio Summerville\nTransfer: Leeds United to West Ham United\nFee: £25m\nThe best player in the Championship last season, Crysencio Summerville was always going to be playing Premier League football in 2024/25 - regardless of Leeds winning promotion or not.\nIn the end, the Whites fell at the final hurdle in their quest for promotion, so Summerville has taken his talents to West Ham in order to play top flight football once again.\nExpect the wide forward to thrive in east London this season.\n14. Yankuba Minteh\nTransfer: Newcastle United to Brighton & Hove Albion\nFee: £33m\nWhen Brighton sign a player, chances are he's going to be pretty good.\nWhen they sign a player for £33m, chances are he's going to be unbelievably good.\nKeep an eye out for Yankuba Minteh this season. He may be unbelievably good.\n13. Noussair Mazraoui\nTransfer: Bayern Munich to Manchester United\nFee: £17.1m\nHaving watched Manchester United struggle to even field a defence at all last season (as can be seen in their 'goals against' record), it makes sense that the new recruitment team have gone out and signed a load of defenders this summer.\nOne defender they swooped in to sign was the talented Noussair Mazraoui - a full-back who is equally adept on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball.\nThat £17.1m fee may prove to be quite the steal.\n12. Niclas Fullkrug\nTransfer: Borussia Dortmund to West Ham United\nFee: £27.5m\nWest Ham have been notoriously terrible at signing strikers during the Premier League era, but they may have finally bagged a good one this summer.\nAlthough 31 years old, Niclas Fullkrug is coming to east London at the peak of his powers, having fired Borussia Dortmund to the Champions League final last season.\n11. Daichi Kamada\nTransfer: Lazio to Crystal Palace\nFee: Free\nOliver Glasner is getting the Eintracht Frankfurt band back together at Crystal Palace, and he's starting with Daichi Kamada.\nThe Japan international was fantastic under Glasner in Germany. He's the best free transfer any Premier League club has made this summer, by quite a distance.\n10. Archie Gray\nTransfer: Leeds United to Tottenham Hotspur\nFee: £30m\nIf you've played a second of FM24, you'll know how good signing Archie Gray is for Tottenham Hotspur.\nThe sky is the limit for the wonderkid, and working under a manager like Ange Postecoglou will be hugely beneficial to his development.\n9. Amadou Onana\nTransfer: Everton to Aston Villa\nFee: £50m\nAmadou Onana has big shoes to fill at Aston Villa, with the towering Belgian set to take over from Douglas Luiz in the heart of the midfield.\nLuckily for Unai Emery and co, he may just be the perfect man for the job.\n8. Jean-Clair Todibo\nTransfer: OGC Nice to West Ham United\nFee: £4m loan with £30m option\nConsidering the fact that West Ham beat literal Juventus to the signing of Jean-Clair Todibo, this signing can be considered one of the greatest transfer coups in the club's history.\nThe French centre-back will completely transform the Hammers' defence.\n7. Mats Wieffer\nTransfer: Feyenoord to Brighton & Hove Albion\nFee: £25.4m\nAs mentioned already, when Brighton signed a player, the chances are the player is quite good.\nIf you watched Feyenoord last season, you'll know that Mats Wieffer is exactly that.\nHis defensive prowess in the middle of the park will be key to Brighton this season.\n6. Leny Yoro\nTransfer: LOSC Lille to Manchester United\nFee: £60m\nBy beating Real Madrid to the signing of Leny Yoro this summer, Man Utd not only proved that they can still attract the most coveted players on the market but they also signed a potentially generational defender at that.\nDisappointingly, Yoro will be out of action for the first few months of the season, but when he returns to full fitness he'll be an integral part of Erik ten Hag's long term plans.\n5. Joshua Zirkzee\nTransfer: Bologna to Manchester United\nFee: £36.5m\nIt's not an exaggeration to say that Joshua Zirkzee may single-handedly get Man Utd's attack firing on all cylinders this season.\nThe forward's hold-up play and his eye for a pass will help Marcus Rashford and co. find their best form in 2024/25.\n4. Dominic Solanke\nTransfer: Bournemouth to Tottenham Hotspur\nFee: £55m\nAfter a career-best Premier League goalscoring campaign, Dominic Solanke rightfully earned a move to a top six club this summer.\nAnd it may be the perfect top six club for him too. The towering striker fill fit seamlessly into Postecoglou attacking set-up, and score a boatload of goals in it too.\n3. Riccardo Calafiori\nTransfer: Bologna to Arsenal\nFee: £42m\nHaving watched Calafiori star for Italy at Euro 2024, it's fair to say that Arsenal fans are pretty excited about this signing.\nThe defender will fill a huge hole in the Gunners side as an inverted left-back, utilising both his defensive and offensive prowess.\n2. Savio\nTransfer: Troyes to Manchester City\nFee: £34m\nDid the City Group-owned Manchester City really pay City Group-owned Troyes £34m to sign Savio?\nMaybe not.\nRegardless, they have quite the player on the hands heading into the 2024/25 season.\n1. Matthijs de Ligt\nTransfer: Bayern Munich to Manchester United\nFee: £38.5m\nSure, he was second choice to Eric Dier at the tail-end of last season. And sure, the banter accounts have had a field day with that fact since De Ligt signed for Man Utd.\nHowever, there's no doubting that De Ligt can still become one of the best defenders in the world.\nAt Man Utd and under Ten Hag, he'll have the perfect opportunity to do exactly that.",
