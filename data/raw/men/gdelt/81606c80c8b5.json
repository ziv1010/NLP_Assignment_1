I wish you nothing but the best for the future in your new chapter,\" Hudson-Odoi wrote.\nPostecoglou's first game in charge will be Forest's trip to Arsenal on Saturday.\nHe becomes the eighth permanent manager since Marinakis took over in May 2017.\nPostecoglou's time at Tottenham\nSpurs lost 22 of their 38 league matches last season, accumulating only 38 points as they finished 17th - their worst finish in the Premier League.\nThey conceded 65 goals, with only Wolves and the relegated trio of Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton shipping more.\nBut Postecoglou led the club to a first major trophy in 17 years with a 1-0 win over Manchester United in the Europa League final.\nThe victory secured Champions League football, but it was not enough to keep Postecoglou in a job and he was sacked by the club 16 days later.\nSpurs, who appointed Thomas Frank as his successor, said Postecoglou would be remembered for delivering \"one of the club's greatest moments\" in becoming only the third manager to win them a European trophy.\nTottenham finished fifth in his first season in charge before he kept his promise to provide silverware in his second year.\nPostecoglou was initially praised for the attacking style he implemented, but he was forced to defend himself from criticism for sticking to his principles and had to contend with a catalogue of injuries to key players.\nHow Postecoglou abandoned 'Ange-ball' to win Europa League\n- Published22 May 2025\nEx-Forest boss Cooper named Brondby head coach\n- Published9 September 2025\nHigh-intensity style raises questions for Forest - analysis\nAcross his past three jobs, Postecoglou's sides have played in a 4-3-3 or 4-4-1-1 shape that aimed to dominate the ball, playing quickly with it, and pressing incredibly aggressively without it.\nThe high intensity of his style in all phases has become a hallmark of his system, with positives and negatives.\nFrom build-up, Postecoglou involves his goalkeeper and uses the back four and defensive midfielder in an interesting way.\nBuild-up is focused heavily down the centre of the pitch, with six players playing in a compact way.\nBoth full-backs are seen inverting into midfield so need to have strong technical quality. The rationale here is that you are likely to outnumber the opposition in build-up, making it easier to move up the pitch.\nIf opposition players mark your players in build-up, Postecoglou's use of positional rotations is a tool to get players free in order to receive the ball.\nPostecoglou likes to use rotations very frequently, with two or three players often seen swapping between rigid positions in order to move defences around to find the free man. It looks fluid but it is often calculated.\nIt is clear that Nuno's counter-attacking style differs largely from Postecoglou's approach, so what does this mean for Forest?\nForest's transfer business this summer appears to have been done with an eye on becoming a more technical, ball-dominant side.\nInterestingly, James McAtee, Douglas Luiz and Oleksandr Zinchenko are all players who have all developed at Manchester City, highlighting the change in intent.\nBig-money signing Omari Hutchinson and fellow Chelsea graduate Calum Hudson-Odoi might also enjoy playing in a way that ensures they keep the ball more, with licence to create.\nQuestions arise when looking at the out-of-possession differences between both managers.\nNuno has often held the lowest defensive line in the league across his various clubs, with Postecoglou playing the highest defensive line at Spurs.\nIf this drastic change is implemented immediately, some of Forest's strongest defenders, who thrive on defending their box, may not be maximised. The defensively astute Nikola Milenkovic comes to mind here.\nThe difference in system raises questions for somebody like Ola Aina, who had an incredible campaign last season playing as a touchline wing-back, a role that differs from the inverted full-back demands asked of a Postecoglou full-back.\nPostecoglou has been reluctant to alter his system, but there was a level of pragmatism seen in Spurs' Europa League win.\nTottenham were happier to defend their own box for large periods of time, leading to success against Eintracht Frankfurt and United.\nWithout a pre-season, and coming into a club that has been built on a counter-attacking, five-at-the-back style, adopting an approach more in line with Spurs' knockout games might be a sensible thing to do early in Postecoglou's tenure.\n'Postecoglou not the most popular' - fan view\nPat Riddell, Nottingham Forest fan writer\nPostecoglou replacing Nuno is perhaps no surprise given the rumours over the past few weeks.\nHowever, he does not seem to be the most popular name among the fanbase.\nForget the Europa League final win over a Manchester United side in turmoil. Postecoglou nearly relegated the ninth richest club in the world.\nHis gung-ho tactics and high line will succeed spectacularly or fail miserably.\nWe should be looking to progressive managers who will continue the tradition established by Nuno and Cooper - names such as Marco Silva, Oliver Glasner and Andoni Iraola are much more in that vein.\nThe squad is the best in a lifetime.\nCan the new manager pick things up where Nuno left off and take us to the next level? Or will we be left dreaming of what was and what might have been?\nPostecoglou's time before Tottenham\nWhen he was appointed Tottenham manager in June 2023, Postecoglou became the first Australian to manage in the Premier League.\nHis playing career was spent in Australia, primarily with South Melbourne, where he played under Ferenc Puskas, the legendary Hungarian to whom Postecoglou attributes his coaching philosophy.\nHe stepped into management in 1996 with South Melbourne before winning back-to-back A-League titles with Brisbane Roar between 2009 and 2012.\nAfter a season with Melbourne Victory he became manager of Australia in 2013 and guided his country to the 2014 World Cup as well as victory in the 2015 Asian Cup.\nFurther silverware followed during his time in Japan with Yokohama F Marinos, where he ended the club's 15-year wait for a J-League title in 2019.\nHe joined Celtic in the summer of 2021 and went on to win five of the six trophies available to the club, including back-to-back Scottish Premiership titles.",
