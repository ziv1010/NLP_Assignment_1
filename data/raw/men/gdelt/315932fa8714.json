Results in LaLiga are still sketchy, though bitter rivals Barcelona tasted defeat in a shock loss to Leganes on Sunday that has ensured Barca, Real and Atletico Madrid are separated by just one point atop the table.\nAccording to multiple sources, Real Madrid are primed to sign a player from Barcelona’s conquerors next month.\nSpanish journalist Rodra P led the way, revealing Real Madrid are ‘on the verge’ of signing Leganes B centre-back, Lamini Fati, in January.\nThe 18-year-old plays for Leganes B and will slot into Real Madrid’s Juvenil A team (Under-19 level) upon arriving.\nAdding his take on the situation, transfer guru Fabrizio Romano revealed Los Blancos and Fati have ironed out an agreement on personal terms.\nWhat’s more, a club-to-club agreement between Real Madrid and Leganes worth €100,000 is “almost done.”\nTaking to X, Romano wrote: “Real Madrid are set to sign 18-year-old centre back Lamini Fati for €100k fee.\n“Deal almost done with Leganes, personal terms also agreed with Fati who’d join the Juvenil A team. Youth team signing with view on first team future progress.”\nWhy Real Madrid are signing Lamini Fati\nBy Rob McCarthy\nThe talented teenager is a left-footed central defender who first caught the eye when he starred during a practice match between Real Madrid Castilla and Leganes B last summer.\nHe has been described as an “imposing, physically dominant centre-back, strong in duels and very anticipative” who has become an “indispensable player” at his current club.\nAround the time he shone against Real’s second team, Fati was reportedly close to joining LaLiga rivals Valencia but ended up staying at Leganes to continue his footballing education.\nReal Madrid are on the hunt for fresh talent as their academy has been struggling with injuries and mixed form this season, with Fati touted to be a strong capture for the club.\nHe is expected to join up with Real’s Juvenil A team, with a view to becoming a future first-teamer.\nLatest Real Madrid news – Courtois, Martinez, Vinicius Jr\nIn other news, Fabrizio Romano has confirmed Real Madrid intend to offer Thibaut Courtois a new contract at some stage in 2025.\nThe club are firm in the belief Courtois is the number one goalkeeper in world football and duly plan to extend his stay at The Bernabeu. Courtois’ current deal is due to expire at the end of the 2025/26 season.\nElsewhere, TEAMtalk have been informed a rumoured Real Madrid raid on Manchester United for Lisandro Martinez will be very difficult to pull off.\nWhile it’s true that Man Utd are ready to sanction the sales of multiple major stars – including Marcus Rashford – Martinez is not believed to be among those they’re keen to offload.\nAnd finally, TEAMtalk has taken a look at six teams – three of which are in the Premier League – Vinicius Jr could realistically join if leaving Real Madrid.",
