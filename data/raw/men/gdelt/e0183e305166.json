That thrilling finale means United go back above Chelsea and Liverpool, rivals for Champions League qualification, into fourth.\nAdvertisement\nUnited’s opening goal was controversial. The home side were initially awarded a penalty by referee John Brooks after Jorge Cuenca appeared to bring down Matheus Cunha in the box. That decision was overturned by VAR but Cuenca was penalised for an earlier foul right on the edge of the box. From the resulting free kick, Bruno Fernandes sent in a cross that was met by a powerful Casemiro header, back across Bernd Leno and into the net.\nEleven minutes into the second half United appeared to have the game wrapped up, as Cunha fired in a powerful finish from Casemiro’s pass.\nBut Fulham refused to give up. First Cuenca had a goal disallowed by VAR for offside earlier in the move, and then, with five minutes left, Raul Jimenez was felled by Harry Maguire in the box. The Mexican striker stepped up and smashed his penalty into the net.\nWith United looking nervous, Fulham poured forward and Kevin, on as a substitute, equalised with a magnificent strike in the 91st minute.\nThree minutes later, Sesko finished into the top corner after skilful work by Fernandes. It was a remarkable conclusion to an exhilarating game.\nCarl Anka and Chris McKenna dissect the key talking points.\nHow will United replace Casemiro?\nThis was another game which raises the question of how and who United will replace Casemiro in the summer.\nThere are valid reasons for not triggering the extension in his contract given the significant wages he earns but, despite turning 34 later this month and his legs not being as quick as they used to be, United are losing a top-level defensive midfielder who helps them at both ends of the pitch.\nCasemiro’s goal in the 19th minute showed one quality they will miss when he departs — aerial ability from set pieces. This was on the offensive front as he rose to head home Fernandes’ 19th-minute free kick to put United in front.\nAdvertisement\nThe goal brought acclaim from the Old Trafford crowd who have taken him on as a hero despite previous criticisms as to why the club invested so heavily in an ageing midfielder who had won pretty much everything at Real Madrid when they signed him in 2022.\nHis passing in the first half wasn’t always accurate — he misplaced six of 26 — but it also showed his willingness to move the ball on, pushing it forward rather than looking for the safer option.\nThere was one moment when Emile Smith Rowe coasted between the lines to get space in front of the United back four with Casemiro struggling to get back.\nBut then later in the half he played his part in mopping up with Maguire when Smith Rowe first tried to break through and then the lively Samuel Chukwueze.\nThat courage on the ball resulted in the second. It was Casemiro’s pass through to Cunha which put his fellow Brazilian through to fire United further ahead.\nIf United needed a reminder of his importance, a look at how Fulham gained more confidence and threat once he was replaced by Manuel Ugarte in the 75th minute.\nHe was on a yellow card after a sloppy foul but the London side soon found it easier to play through United. They won a penalty which Jimenez dispatched to make it a nervy ending for the hosts.\nIn January 2023, Erik ten Hag described the midfielder as “the cement between the stones” for his United team. “His defending, his organisation,” said the Dutchman. “He knows his position, anticipating and pointing players into the right position, winning balls in midfield.”\nCasemiro continues to be essential to all that is good to this side. United’s recruitment team will have their work cut out to replace him.\nChris McKenna\nHow did Carrick’s United fare against a deeper defence?\n“Doesn’t always matter, always a transitional team,” was Pep Guardiola’s assessment of United following the 2-0 win in the Manchester Derby.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s been a common sentiment for years. Give United players space to run in behind a defence, and they can beat almost anyone. Sit in deep and give them greater command of the ball, and they can be found wanting.\nVictory over Manchester City and Arsenal saw Carrick restore some of the feel-good vibes, but Fulham was painted as “the real test” of the interim period. How would Carrick and his coaching staff break down a team less inclined to play with a high line?\nThe answer came from a straightforward source: set-piece goalscoring. When Cuenca felled Cunha in the penalty area in the 16th minute, he might have breathed a small sigh of relief when VAR downgraded the foul from a penalty to a free kick close to the byline. United found a route to goal anyway; Fernandes floated a ball over towards the back post for Casemiro to head home.\nThe 2025-26 season has seen multiple clubs use set-piece goals as a means to unlock deep defences, before then upping their attacking intensity when the opposition team venture forward in search of an equaliser. Arsenal are masters of the method (17 set-piece goals this season), but United are not far behind with 14.\nThere is an interesting alchemy Carrick and his coaching staff are trying to imbue into United’s attacking players. Bryan Mbeumo again started as the nominal centre-forward, working as a more fluid reference point than Sesko. The first half saw the Cameroon international attempt to run in behind Fulham’s back four (one of his key strengths), but also drop deep to combine with team-mates and offer quick one-two passes, similar to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s use of Anthony Martial over Romelu Lukaku during his interim period in 2019.\nIf you imagine Fulham’s defence as a locked safe, United first dented the door with a sledgehammer set-piece goal, before fiddling with the combination numbers thereafter.\nCarl Anka\nAdvertisement\nWhy was the opening goal controversial?\nIt was two years ago when Marco Silva, the Fulham manager, was sent off here for arguing over a penalty decision as his side capitulated in a wild 90 seconds before being dumped out of the FA Cup by the hosts 3-1.\nHere again the officials faced his wrath and a card was brandished for his touchline outburst. Silva was enraged at first when beferee Brooks pointed to the spot after Cunha went down under a challenge from Cuenca.\nHis anger was not quelled when the Video Assistant Referee James Bell advised Brooks he should change his decision. That was because he instead gave a free kick for Cuenca having pulled Cunha’s shirt outside the box.\nIt had appeared the penalty was given for the later lunge, which did see the Fulham player win the ball but the fact Brooks then gave the free kick suggests he was aware of the pull and that was part of his reasoning for giving the foul.\nThe Premier League Match Centre posted on X: “After VAR review, the referee overturned the on-field decision of penalty to Manchester United.” In the same post they included the referee’s announcement: “After review, the Fulham 15 commits a holding offence outside the penalty area. The final decision is a free kick to Manchester United.”\nSilva was booked for his reaction. His anger won’t have been helped by the fact Fernandes’ free kick was headed home by Casemiro for the opener. However, looking at replays there can be no doubt it was a clear shirt pull by Cuenca before he lunged in. It was also outside the area, so the decision was correct in the end.\nSilva’s patience was further tested in the second half when Cuenca had a goal ruled out because Chukwueze was deemed narrowly offside in the build up. The Fulham manager greeted the decision with sarcastic applause.\nAdvertisement\nFollowing the match, Silva told Sky Sports: “The story of the game started with a horrendous, terrible decision from John Brooks with the penalty he gave. Horrendous decision from that moment, big, big mistake. It was the first time we saw all the Premier League fans and us coaches and players. We have to take all this frustration to win the next one.”\nAnd on the VAR decision, he added: “The penalty was given by the tackle. After, because the decision was so bad, they found a different foul.”\nChris McKenna\nAre United getting nastier under Carrick?\nIt took a pronounced VAR delay for match officials to rule out a supposed goal from Cuenca. The semi-automated offsides ruled Chukwueze to have strayed ahead of Amad and into an offside decision before Jimenez’s free kick ricocheted off the United wall and started pinballing across the penalty area.\nHighlight reels will focus on the VAR decision, but The Athletic would like to discuss how Fulham won the initial set piece. The away team got their chance due to Casemiro cynically pulling down Smith Rowe when the 25-year-old began to slalom into the final third.\nCarrick’s United are focusing their defensive efforts more on recovery runs and tackles than front-foot pressing. The team largely retreat into a compact 4-4-2 when without the ball for long periods of time, and on the occasions they do press, it is with a man-to-man orientation that leaves Maguire as a spare player at the back to sweep things up.\nOpponents have a degree of freedom to build out from the back, but United players will look to stick a boot in when they look to be building too much momentum past the halfway line. Casemiro was not the only player to give away a free kick on the edge of United’s penalty area. In the 51st minute, Luke Shaw would drop Harry Wilson with a foul that would force Senne Lammens to be on high alert from the resultant set piece.\nAdvertisement\nIs it risky to allow opponents this much time on the ball? Fulham’s 85th-minute penalty was an example of how last-gasp defending can go wrong. Maguire and Lammens were quick to block off Jimenez, but were too forceful when making their challenges.\nThe striker made no mistake with his spot kick, making the final 10 minutes a rather tense affair. United retreated further and further towards their box, affording Kevin extra space to bend a superb long-range effort past Lammens in the 91st minute.\nThe defensive gamble looked to have misfired until Sesko responded with a goal of his own three minutes later. The football hasn’t been dull under Carrick across his three games in 2025-26. His attacking players have the creative freedom to make up for any individual glitches his defensive players incur.\nIf Fulham was “the real test” of this recent period, his players are currently passing with a B grade.\nCarl Anka\nWhat did Michael Carrick say?\nOn the importance of the result: “I knew today was going to be a really tough game. We came getting questions all week and people expecting, what are you going to do about breaking down a low block? Fulham was never going to do that. They’ve shown that this is a really, really good team. So we knew today was going to be a big, big challenge. and I knew it wasn’t going to be easy, it wasn’t going to go smoothly, and even at 2-0, they were 5-1 down against City, and then coming back to 5-4.\n“So, you kind of knew that in going into the game, and I think the character to show that, once you’ve had that big setback, it was a huge setback in the 90th minute or whenever it was [to concede], to do that on the back of what we did last week off the setback, it’s probably the most pleasing thing. Keep the belief, keep the confidence.\n“Listen, the rest of the game, we can play better at times, we can do things a lot better in certain moments, but I can’t fault the players, the spirit has taken us through today, and it’s a good feeling when it does.\nAdvertisement\nHow important was that moment for Sesko: “Huge moment, I’m so, so pleased as is everyone, the changing room, the players, the staff, absolutely delighted, and the reception, he got when he came back from the changing room, kind of told us everything.\n“I think he’s been fantastic, we’ve worked with him in a lot of different ways over the last couple of weeks, he’s been bright in training, he’s looked dangerous, he’s done extra, the coaches have done a lot of bits on the side, particularly Trav [Travis Binnion] he’s done a lot of work one-on-one with him, Ben’s a big talent, he’s got so many positive things, today’s a huge goal because that feeling, as a striker there to score a win in front of the Stretford End, it’s kind of what you dream of really.”\nOn late winners being part of United’s DNA: “It ends up meaning more, I think people leave here with more than just a United win today, and it kind of puts layers on top of that, the connection, the feeling, the emotion, it’s why we all love it so much, and especially the supporters, it goes a long way, there’s been plenty. The excitement, that’s part of this club, it’s not always the easiest way, but we like to win games a little bit more comfortably than that, but certainly when they come along, it’s pretty special.”\nOn Kobbie Mainoo’s performance: “Kobbie’s performance was very, very good today in so many ways again. You could see that the way Fulham play and overload the middle times in the movements and there was a lot of work for Kobbie and Cassie to do in particular in the middle of the pitch.\n“So that was without the ball, and I thought he’s terrific in that. And then with the ball, I’ve spoke about it before, about the ability to just cope, he’s not really fazed by it. He’s just he plays his game. He understands what’s needed and it’s the moments of quality. It’s kind of what we come to expect from him in many ways and what I can’t come to expect but you forget how young he is still. He’s still got loads to come but seeing him today and playing with that kind of confidence in their belief is There’s a real joy to watch to be honest for any young player.”\nWhat next for Manchester United?\nSaturday, February 7: Tottenham Hotspur (Home), Premier League, 12.30pm UK, 7:30am ET",
