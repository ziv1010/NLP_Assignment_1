Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘In the Premier League, I have the feeling now that Arsenal is not going to drop much points,’ Guardiola said ahead of Manchester City’s trip to Aston Villa.\n‘So that is the reality. I have that feeling with Arsenal, with Liverpool as well.\n‘Now Liverpool lost their last games – not in the Champions League in Frankfurt – but I saw the game against United, they had incredible chances to win the game.\n‘So I think Liverpool remain one of the main favourites to do that. And the distance, three, four points at this stage is nothing.\n‘I always had the feeling that both teams and maybe another one, they will lose few, few points. That’s why we have to be there.’\nGuardiola, bidding to lift his seventh Premier League trophy as Man City manager, made a similar comment last week when asked about the title race.\nAsked if he believes third-placed City are flying under the radar in the Premier League, Guardiola sarcastically replied: ‘Well, in the first two games, three games, yeah for sure we [City] are out.\n‘And Liverpool is already done, and now it looks like Liverpool is done. And I’ll tell you that they will be back.\nMore Trending\n‘I’ve said many times, I know all the pundits, all the specialists or former players, they know everything that is going to happen after five games, I’m not able to do that.\n‘So, always I wait for 10, 15 games to know exactly what is going on. But I think obviously Liverpool and Arsenal are there, someone else will be there, hopefully we can be there.’\nManchester City have won five of their six matches since sharing a 1-1 draw with title rivals Arsenal in mid-September and beat Villarreal 2-0 last time out.\nSunday’s other Premier League fixtures include Tottenham’s trip to Everton and basement boys Wolves taking on Burnley in a relegation six-pointer.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Danny Welbeck makes huge Manchester United claim after Brighton defeat\nMORE: Gary Neville makes prediction over two Man Utd stars after victory against Brighton\nMORE: Ruben Amorim makes shock Arsenal claim after Man Utd’s win over Brighton",
