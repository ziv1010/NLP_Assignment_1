The problem we’ve had is because we had injuries to start with. The early ones we picked up, it meant our squad just hasn’t managed the games.\n“It’s been impossible to, we’ve had to pick the same players continually and eventually those players with the load that they’re playing under will break, so I think we’ve just been a victim of circumstance.\n“Don’t get me wrong, there have been mistakes made and there will always be mistakes made medically because it’s that kind of profession. You’re not going to get every assessment right. A lot of the time, you’re in the hands of the specialist.\n“But the weight of games we’ve had – and it’s still unrelenting for us – we just haven’t recovered properly.”\nFour stand out quotes for me and ones that could easily point to our less than barnstorming start to the season as seen by some people.\nThe “load” the players were playing under last season was massive in terms of games and terms of intensity. It was well known we had a high intense approach to games and that it was a big reason we were so good for periods the season before last. That intensity will eventually have consequences and subsequently, as injuries arrive, the squad will indeed not “manage the games.”\n“Mistakes made” was undoubtably referencing the medical department but also could have been an introspective admission that changes would have to follow, something which would be highly unlikely to be implemented mid-season.\nCue the arrival of Jonny King as new Head Physio in February of this year and Performance Director James Bunce (pictured below) over the summer. Certainly the performance director will have had a say and will likely have said the intensity could be a cause of the injuries.\nEddie Howe again:\n“The players do a lot of work. They don’t just go out on the training pitch, they do a lot of gym work, a lot of different things. If we are sitting here going we have not made any mistakes I think we are being fools. So, of course, we analyse everything. When I say we, I include everyone at the football club. It’s not about one individual or department. We are all in it together and, of course, we have to respond.”\nAnd it appears they have.\n“Intensity is our identity” is a quote seen at the club’s training ground and an Eddie Howe mantra, but there comes a point where the intensity becomes too much and players will indeed “break.”\nMaybe Eddie Howe and his team of staff have looked at that over the summer and came to the conclusion that the intensity needs to be better implemented or managed. It would certainly explain why we’ve seemed to change our style of play a little.\nFrom the games I’ve seen this season, we seem to come out with a bit of a flourish in the first 10-15 minutes and then almost become deliberately lacklustre. Some would call it a more patient style of play. It would be one way to avoid the injuries we saw last season.\nA final quote of Eddie Howe from last season’s injury problems:\n“We’re reviewing every one we get and trying to find a reason why. Some are freaks but there are some, usually muscle pulls, where you’re going: ‘Is there a way we could have avoided that?’”\nMaybe, whilst doing things differently in training, a tweak to our style of play is being implemented in matches and we are seeing the outcome in terms of results AND injury prevention.\nIn turn, by hook or by crook we are actually bettering last season’s results in the process. For so much negativity filtering around after an average transfer window, we are four points better off after just three games.\nIt may not be the easiest on the eye, watching a team transitioning from going hell for leather for 90+ minutes to a team that has the odd change in gear, but ultimately has something in reserve.\nHowever, if it means we have a full quota of Newcastle United players for longer this season, I’m happy enough to see the results.\nIf “mistakes were made”, I’m happy that on the training pitch and on a matchday, lessons appear to have been learnt.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
