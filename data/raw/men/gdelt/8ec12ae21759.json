  "body_text": "Newcastle United midfielder Sandro Tonali has reportedly agreed to accept a 10-month ban from competitive professional football.\nThat’s according to a recent report from the Daily Mail, who claims the Italy international, who was investigated for illegal betting activity while playing for AC Milan, will miss as many as 10 months.\nHaving seen his agent come out and admit his star client is suffering with a gambling addiction, Newcastle United fans were resigned to their new £55 million signing being handed a suspension; the only question was over its length, and now it is set to be confirmed.\nThere is some good news for the midfielder though. It has been claimed that his suspension will not begin until after Wednesday night’s Champions League group game against Borussia Dortmund, and that will offer Eddie Howe a huge boost as he seeks to guide the Magpies to the tournament’s knockout rounds.\nTonight’s huge match at St. James’ Park, which is set to kick off at 8 p.m. (UK time), will be broadcast live on TNT Sports.",
