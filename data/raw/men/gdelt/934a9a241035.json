Feyenoord (new entry)\nA new entry late in the season, Feyenoord have been so consistent in domestic and continental football all season thanks to their wonderful manager Arne Slot.\nHe's being linked with every top job for a very good reason.\nSean: \"They're deserving of their place in this rankings, they've been on a complete tear in the Eredivisie and are on the verge of a Europa League semi-final.\"\n8. Brighton and Hove Albion (re-entry)\nAs expected, Brighton completely played Chelsea off the park at Stamford Bridge on Saturday to earn a 2-1 win.\nWho thought that Brighton doing that would be 'expected' this season?\nA Wembley semi-final clash with Manchester United awaits Roberto De Zerbi's side this weekend.\nJack: \"They've been one of the funner teams to watch in Europe this season.\"\n7.

AC Milan (up 1)\nOver two-legs against Serie A runaway leaders Napoli, AC Milan put in a vintage defensive performance.\nThey kept Napoli at arm's length and then, thanks to the brilliance of Rafael Leao, had the quality to go and score the goals which have seen them safely through to their first Champions League semi final since 2007.\nJack: \"One of the best defensive performances of the last five or 10 years.\"\n1. Manchester City\nManchester City currently look unbeatable.\nThey put in yet another professional performance against Bayern to make it through to the Champions League semi finals, they have an FA Cup semi final against Sheffield United to look forward to this weekend, and then they face off against Arsenal in a Premier League title decider next Wednesday.\nThe treble is on, and the chances of it being completed hinge on the next seven days.\nSean: \"They can beat teams in more ways now.\"",
