Then the Uyo city representative from the southern Nigerian state of Akwa Ibom won the Nigeria Professional Football League title for the first time in the 24 year history of the club.\nThe story began with the Ibom Stars team in Nigeria in 1996. It started in Pro League – Nigeria’s second division. After ten years of bitter struggle with competitors, the Stars entered the Nigerian Premier League and decided to change the name. In the 2007/2008 season, the Ibom Stars disappeared, and the team was renamed Akwa United (nickname – The Promise Keepers). The club’s management organized the first high-profile transfer in the national league.\nFirst trophy:\nIn the 2014/15 season, Akwa United became a contender for the titles. First, the club moved to the new 30,000-seat Godswill Akpabio stadium and then won the first major trophy – Nigeria FA Cup. In the final match, the Promise Keepers defeated Lobi Stars with a score of 2-1. The title allowed the team to play in the 2016 CAF Confederations Cup and for the first time, the club was talked about outside Nigeria.\nAkwa United went on to lift the FA Cup once again in 2017, beating Niger Tornadoes 5-4 on penalties in Lagos in what was their second national trophy in three years.\n[PROMOTED] Akwa United: Way to dream | TheCable https://t.co/L438X5pvsQ@1xBet_Eng pic.twitter.com/Q68v6TqgHI\n— TheCable (@thecableng) March 27, 2023\nChampionship season and partnership with 1xBet:\nThe rise continued in the 2020/21 season. The team grew into a formidable force and set a new Nigerian league record of 18 games unbeaten. As a result, the Promise Keepers, for the first time in their history, became NPFL champions. As a bonus, the state government made a promise to reward the team with a prize of 100 million Naira.\nThe club’s success did not go unnoticed, and in 2022 the global betting company 1xBet, widely known for its partnership with Barcelona, PSG, Lille, La Liga, Serie A, CAF, and other world-famous sports brands and organizations, became an official partner of Akwa United.\nThe top bookmaker became the team’s official sponsor for 2022-23 NPFL season and its logo appeared on the playing and training jerseys of the club.\nSigning a sponsorship contract with the responsible company 1XBet was a big step in developing Nigerian football and local sports. Akwa United proved that Nigerian sport can be interesting to large international companies.\nIf football is your passion – follow your dream: Akwa United players reaching out to young athletes (ADD VIDEO)\nSeason 2022/23 – a new challenge\nThis season, Ayodeji Ayeni’s team is among the top three teams in Group A after the first stanza of the season and the manager said, the club’s main task is to work hard before the season’s second stage to compete for a place in the Super-Six (NPFL playoffs).\nNice bonus from 1xBet:\nThe NPFL is in full swing, and 1xBet reminds betting fans about the exclusive promo code from Akwa United club.
