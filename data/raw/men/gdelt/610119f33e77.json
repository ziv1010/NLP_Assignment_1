I think for where we are as a club at the moment, without that ability to generate revenue from outside just the football, we would have been in a more difficult position to continually have a team that can compete at the highest level against some of the other clubs.\n\"The main reason I joined this football club, more than anything else, and I get it, it's the Premier League, I'm earning decent money, it's high profile, it's got a great stadium, great facilities, [but] it hasn't won anything for a while. That's why I came. That's the biggest attraction.\n\"If they were playing out of the back of some other stadium, it wouldn't have made a difference to me. I see a really big club which hasn't had success for a quite a while and it's a great challenge for me.\"\nTottenham have not won a trophy since 2008 when they took home the League Cup. They have since reached various finals - including in the Champions League in 2019 - but have endured a lengthy spell without silverware despite establishing themselves as a 'big six' Premier League side.",
