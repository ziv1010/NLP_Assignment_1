The alert has been circulated as Arsenal, one of the Premier League's teams, reaches the final four of the European competition.\nLiz Ziegler, fraud prevention director at Lloyds, says: “Recent trends show a sharp rise in online ticket scams, with social media platforms such as Facebook Marketplace and Instagram being popular places for fraudsters to lure victims with offers of fake tickets.\n“Our research from 2024 shows that football ticket scams increased by around a third last season, with victims losing £177 on average. However, in some cases, this can be in the thousands.”\nREAD MORE Exact dates next UK mini-heatwave start and end with 72-hour scorcher set to hit\nZiegler adds: “These scams often involve posting pictures of authentic-looking tickets to convince buyers they’re genuine.\n\"Once the buyer pays, typically via an insecure payment method like a bank transfer, the scammer disappears, leaving fans disappointed, without tickets and their hard-earned money.”\nArsenal take on PSG at the Emirates on Tuesday 29 April before the return leg in the French capital on 7 May. Lloyds' tips include to always use your debit or credit card when you buy tickets online.\nThis helps to protect your money should something go wrong, the bank - which is rivalled by Santander, HSBC UK, NatWest, Nationwide and more - has said.\nFraudsters use social media to advertise tickets that don’t exist. They can even send offers straight to your inbox. If you’re looking for a ticket, always search for it yourself from a trusted source, the bank has added in a previous alert issued to supporters.\nLow prices and seemingly great deals are often used to disguise scams, the high street banking giant went on to warn fans of the Emirates Stadium outfit.\nHowever, if demand for tickets is high or a game is sold out, fraudsters can charge more to trick desperate buyers, Lloyds warned.\nThe winners of the tie will play either Barcelona or Inter Milan in the final - which will be in Munich on Saturday, 31 May.\nArsenal have already played PSG in this Champions League campaign - beating Luis Enrique's side 2-0 at Emirates Stadium during the 36-team league phase.",
