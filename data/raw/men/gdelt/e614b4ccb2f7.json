While Ruben Amorim’s side considered Endrick as a solution amid Joshua Zirkzee’s potential exit and Benjamin Sesko’s struggles, a move now seems unlikely. But four other English clubs are also in the mix…\nREAD MORE 🔴⚫ Man Utd take GIANT leap towards sealing necessary deal after condition met\nWest Ham face obstacles in Endrick pursuit\nSome sources indicate that West Ham have emerged as frontrunners to sign Endrick, but the Hammers are not the player’s first choice, after the London side failed with an enquiry for him in January.\nAston Villa, meanwhile, who were linked earlier with a possible swap with Jhon Duran are still keen and working under Unai Emery is something Endrick is considering.\nBrighton are also in the mix but would want a permanent option, while Newcastle United’s interest remains less concrete.\nAcross Europe, Juventus are monitoring Endrick after an approach over the summer, viewing him as a boost for their Serie A campaign.\nMarseille, leveraging strong ties with Real Madrid, are keen on a loan to aid his development; this move does suit Madrid who would be happy to send him to France.\nIn LaLiga, Real Sociedad and Valencia, who expressed interest last summer, could reignite their pursuit, offering Endrick a chance to stay in Spain.\nWith endless clubs circling, Endrick’s situation should be easy to fix and a move sorted quickly. Real Madrid’s stance on a loan versus a permanent move will shape the outcome, but Endrick’s need for minutes makes a temporary switch likely.\nAs January nears, the race for this Brazilian prodigy is heating up – will he light up the Premier League or shine elsewhere in Europe?\nTRANSFER DEBRIEF 🔎 £70m star to transform Man Utd midfield; Tottenham ‘statement of intent’; Chelsea elite signing boost\nLatest Real Madrid news: Nico Paz, Marc Guehi updates\nMeanwhile, Arsenal are reportedly interested in Como attacking midfielder Nico Paz, but a move to Real Madrid is thought to be more likely for him.\nPaz himself has publicly said that he dreams of starring for Real Madrid in the long run.\nIn other news, reports from Spain suggest that Real Madrid are considering making a bid for Crystal Palace centre-back Marc Guehi in January, as they look to beat Liverpool to his signature.\nLos Blancos could offer around €30-35million (up to £30.4m, $40.8m) for the England international, it’s claimed.",
