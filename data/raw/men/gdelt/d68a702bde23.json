Ancelotti’s side went on to be thrashed in the Champions League semi-finals by Manchester City and finished 10 points behind Barca in La Liga, with that cup win the sole major trophy that season (they had won the UEFA Super Cup and old FIFA Club World Cup).\n- Follow live coverage of Barcelona vs Real Madrid in today’s El Clasico Copa del Rey final\nIt is a familiar scenario before this Saturday’s final against Barca — except Madrid have already been knocked out of the Champions League in the quarter-finals by Arsenal. They trail Barca by four points in La Liga with five games to go, including a Clasico at their rivals’ temporary home ground, the Estadi Olimpic Lluis Companys.\nYou might be surprised to learn those above Copa triumphs represent the three times Real Madrid have won Spain’s national cup in the past 31 years.\nFor a club that takes success so seriously, it is not a particularly impressive return. In that same period, they have claimed the Champions League nine times.\nMadrid have won the Champions League/European Cup 15 times. They have won La Liga on 36 occasions. Both totals represent competition records — and leave them comfortably clear of the teams behind them. Milan have lifted seven Champions League/European Cup trophies and Barcelona have won the Spanish league 27 times.\n💥 Never forget.\n🏃 @GarethBale11\n🆚 @FCBarcelona\n📅 16/04/2014 #RealFootball | #OTD pic.twitter.com/2MO6YkTT9k— Real Madrid C.F. 🇬🇧🇺🇸 (@realmadriden) April 16, 2023\nThe Copa del Rey is a different story, though. Real Madrid have 20 trophies, which leaves them third in the all-time list behind Barcelona (31) and holders Athletic Club (24).\nAdvertisement\nSpeak to people who know Real Madrid well, and the suggestion is that it all comes down to priorities.\n“In this club, the Copa del Rey has never been thrown away, but if Madrid is the one with the most La Liga and Champions League titles, it’s because of the right order of priorities,” said a Real Madrid director — who, like others in this piece, preferred to speak to The Athletic anonymously to protect their position.\nThe director does not feel there is a simple “single explanation” for Madrid’s comparative lack of success in the competition, and that is probably right. But they also admit there is a compelling case for branding Madrid as “not very ‘copero’ (geared towards success in the cup)”.\nBecause it is not just that Madrid have not managed to win the trophy as often as you might expect. It goes further than that.\nIn the Copa del Rey, Madrid have suffered the most embarrassing and painful results in their history.\nLet’s first head back to 2002.\nThat year, as Real Madrid celebrated their centenary, Vicente del Bosque’s side played the final at their home stadium, with Deportivo La Coruna their opponents.\nDeportivo spoiled the party by winning 2-1. Legend has it the Galician club even swooped in to take up Madrid’s post-match party reservation at a local restaurant where the celebratory drinks had already been put on ice.\nAt the end of that season, Zinedine Zidane’s unforgettable volley sealed another Champions League trophy for Del Bosque and his team, who beat Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 in the final in Glasgow. But the Deportivo defeat hurt — and there was more pain to come.\nThe following season, Madrid were knocked out by Real Mallorca in the quarter-finals, losing 5-1 on aggregate. Then in 2004, they lost another final they were expected to win, this time 3-2 against Real Zaragoza at the Lluis Companys in Barcelona.\nAdvertisement\nIt would be another seven years before they reached the final again. But before then, there were two true humiliations.\nIn 2008-09, Madrid were knocked out in the round of 32, the stage they entered the competition. They lost to Real Union de Irun, who were playing in Spain’s third tier at the time. Having lost the away leg 3-2, they won the home leg 4-3, but a 6-6 aggregate draw saw Bernd Schuster’s side exit on away goals.\nThe following season was even worse: a strong Madrid side that featured Raul, Guti, Karim Benzema, Rafael van der Vaart and Lassana Diarra were hammered 4-0 away at Alcorcon, another third-division team. Only managing to win the home leg 1-0, they crashed out.\nThat 4-0 defeat in the October — referred to since as the “Alcorconazo” — ended up costing coach Manuel Pellegrini his job at the end of the season, with the Chilean unable to recover from the embarrassment.\nIf the loss could be considered one of the most humiliating in Madrid’s history, their 2015-16 Copa del Rey exit has to go down as the most unusual.\nIn December, Madrid travelled to Cadiz to play the first leg of their round of 32 tie. On the night, Rafa Benitez’s side won 3-1, but even as the game progressed it was clear something was wrong.\nIt would later turn out that Madrid’s Russian winger Denis Cheryshev was fielded when he ought not to have been, due to a suspension for three bookings he had picked up on loan at Villarreal the previous season.\nCheryshev scored the opening goal in the game’s third minute but, shortly after, the realisation that he should not have been on the pitch began to spread through the stands. The home fans sang: “Benitez, look at Twitter”, “Cheryshev, you can’t play”, “Cheryshev, we love you” and “Benitez stay”.\nTwo days later, Madrid’s fate was confirmed when they were kicked out of the competition by the Spanish Football Federation. A month later, Benitez was sacked by Madrid.\nAdvertisement\nHis replacement was Zidane. Under the Frenchman, Madrid won the Champions League three times in a row, starting from that 2015-16 campaign. But even he would not be spared suffering in the Copa del Rey.\nIn January 2021, during Zidane’s second spell in charge, Madrid were again knocked out by a third-tier side in the round of 32. They lost 2-1 after extra time against Alcoyano, who had Ramon Lopez sent off in the first period of additional playing time. Once again, Madrid played a strong team: Vinicius Jr, Casemiro, Federico Valverde, Marcelo and Eder Militao all started.\nThe defeat led to numerous criticisms and doubts around Zidane, who ended up leaving at the end of that trophyless season — Madrid’s first such campaign since 2009–10.\nFor all these reasons, it is clear to Ancelotti’s staff that a slip-up against Barcelona in the final in Seville could signal the end of his second spell at the club. This month, The Athletic reported the Italian is expected to leave the club, with a preference to join the Brazilian national team.\nThe club’s planning, for now, is focused on the Copa del Rey final — because of who Madrid are facing and their low chances of silverware in other competitions. Treble-chasing Barcelona have thrashed Madrid both times they have faced them this season, 4-0 in La Liga and 5-2 in the Supercopa de Espana final. This week, Ancelotti was asked how he felt about his side being cast as the underdogs for this final.\n“I like it,” he said. “It’s like that, they seem to be better than us, but a final is a final, something unpredictable. To cast Madrid as victims in a final seems a bit exaggerated to me.”\nThen again, Madrid’s relationship with the Copa del Rey is a strange one. This time, a lot more will be at stake than just the cup.\n(Top photo: Jude Bellingham after last season’s Copa del Rey round of 16 elimination by Atletico Madrid; by David S.Bustamante/Soccrates/Getty Images)",
