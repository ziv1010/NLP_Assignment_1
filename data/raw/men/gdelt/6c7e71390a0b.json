I'm kind of living the dream,\" he said at the ceremony in Monaco.\n\"This season is about keeping my head clear. Even more eyes will be on me and my team after winning the Champions League. We have to be sharper and more prepared.\"\nGuardiola was voted ahead of Italians Luciano Spalletti, who led Napoli to their first Serie A title in 33 years, and Simone Inzaghi whose Inter Milan side were Champions League runners-up and won the Italian Cup.\nThe Spanish manager was not present to receive the award as he is recovering from his back surgery.\nEngland coach Sarina Wiegman took the prize for the Women's Coach of the Year after leading the Lionesses to this year's World Cup final and victory in the Finalissima against Brazil at Wembley in April.\nWiegman dedicated her award to the Spain women's team after the kiss incident involving federation president Luis Rubiales took the spotlight when Spain secured their first Women's World Cup title.\n\"(Receiving this award) feels a little different,\" Wiegman said. \"We all know the issues around the Spanish team and it really hurts me as a coach, as a mother of two daughters, as a wife and as a human being.\n\"The game has grown so much but there's also still a long way to go in women's football and society.\n\"I would like to dedicate this award to the Spanish team - the team that played in a World Cup such great football that everyone enjoys.
