Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘There was a situation that I believe could have been avoided by everyone. I think that is logical.\n‘I am going to prevent my players from going any further in that brawl and from then on there is pushing and shoving by everyone.\n‘I think and I repeat, that is not the best thing to do. It’s the result of the tension, the result of the situation of the match and I have nothing more to add.’\nJoao Pedro explains Luis Enrique incident\nWhen asked about the incident with Luis Enrique, Pedro told Sportv: ‘I went to protect Andrey, I saw their players were crowding Andrey.\n‘Like a good Brazilian, I went to protect my friend. A lot of people were arriving and in that mess, I ended up getting shoved. It’s part of it.\n‘They didn’t know how to lose, but that’s football.’\nWhile Enrique pleaded his innocence, the PSG boss still faces the possibility of a ban for his actions towards Pedro.\nAnd former La Liga referee, Eduardo Iturralde Gonzalez believes Enrique could well be forced to watch from the stands when PSG face Tottenham in the Super Cup final next month.\n‘Of course, you can be sanctioned,’ Gonzalez said, speaking to Cadena SER. ‘There’s a difference, the red and yellow cards in the tournament will expire. But FIFA can sanction him with time.\nMore Trending\n‘So, if Luis Enrique is given a one-month ban, he would miss any games in that month. What’s more, he wouldn’t even be able to train the team.’\nAsked if he feels that FIFA will sanction Luis Enrique, Gonzalez replied: ‘You can’t touch an opponent’s face.\n‘I mean, that’s already a humiliating issue, that you have to go over and punch a player in the face when the game is over. I don’t look at names, I look at the action, and if we look at the action, it’s punishable.\n‘We need to be aware because FIFA is above UEFA. If FIFA tells you there are three matches it’s in their competition, but since in this tournament the yellow and red cards end today, FIFA can, on the other hand, sanction players based on time.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Troy Deeney rates Chelsea’s Premier League title chances after Club World Cup triumph\nMORE: Enzo Maresca told to replace Chelsea star after Club World Cup final\nMORE: Enzo Maresca reveals Chelsea targeted three PSG players in Club World Cup final win",
