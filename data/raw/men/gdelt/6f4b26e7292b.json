  "body_text": "Well, it wasn’t a vintage Tottenham performance. There wasn’t a lot of champagne football on display and it certainly got spicy at points. There was also an inexplicably poor VAR decision and some garbage officiating. And yet Tottenham Hotspur endured at the Lane today, beating Chelsea 2-0 behind goals from Oliver Skipp and Harry Kane, two academy graduates. It was the first Premier League goal for Skipp and the 20th of the season for Kane. The win keeps Spurs in fourth place and in prime position to sneak into a Champions League spot when all’s said and done.\nTottenham Hotspur 2-0 Chelsea: Community Player Ratings\nWINNER WINNER FOURTEEN POINTS ABOVE CHELSEA DINNER\nIt’s time to rate the players.\nRate the players from 1⁄2 to 5 stars.
