Lucci had been previously convicted for drug-related charges.\nChristian Rosiello, described by local media as the bodyguard of popular Italian rapper Fedez, was also among the detained.\n“This investigation shows the risks of infiltration creeping into professional and non-professional soccer by organised crime,” said Italy’s anti-mafia prosecutor Giovanni Melillo.\n“We need to stop pretending not to see these risks.”\nMilan prosecutor Marcello Viola clarified that Milan’s two football clubs are “offended parties” in the investigation, having put in place rules to prevent wrongdoing.\n“But they will also have to prove that they have severed any relationship with deviant supporters,” Mr Viola added.",
