  "body_text": "Champions LeagueEintracht Frankfurt v Liverpool: Team news\nArne Slot intends to utilise the depth of his squad for Liverpool's second game of three within seven days, which sees them take on Eintracht Frankfurt.\nA 21-man Reds group made the journey to Germany on Tuesday evening for Wednesday's Champions League clash with the Bundesliga club.\nMatchday three of the league phase comes after Slot's men saw off Atletico Madrid 3-2 at home and were beaten 1-0 on the road by Galatasaray.\nThe fixture at Deutsche Bank Park arrives three days after a Premier League defeat by Manchester United and three ahead of a trip to Brentford.\nSlot was asked if the schedule of the week means he may rotate his options in Frankfurt and told Liverpoolfc.com: \"'Rotate' always comes across as if, 'Oh, let someone else play a little bit as well.'\n\"But I said many times, we have a lot of good players and I can use them all. If you play three games in seven days, it would maybe be smart to use them all as well. That's why, also because we were 1-0 down, but also because we need to use the squad, we made three substitutions after 55 minutes against United.\n\"We will use a lot of players again tomorrow, as we will on Saturday. It is then a certain rotation but 'rotation' could also come across as 'We are good enough to play a few others.' No, no, no - we have more than 11 players that can start a game of football for us and that's why we've done that until now multiple times.\n\"And we might do this tomorrow as well.\"\nThe Liverpool travelling party did not include Ryan Gravenberch after he sustained a twisted ankle during the second half of last Sunday's home loss to United.\nSlot confirmed the midfielder is being assessed with a view to his possible involvement away at Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday.\nWataru Endo is back in contention, however. The Japan international was absent versus United having previously withdrawn from duty for his country.\nFederico Chiesa is also with the team after being added to the Champions League squad in place of the injured Giovanni Leoni.\nAlisson Becker remains sidelined due to the injury he picked up at Galatasaray last time out in Europe.\nHugo Ekitike is in line to face his former club, while Jeremie Frimpong and Florian Wirtz also return to Germany having moved to Anfield from Bayer Leverkusen during the summer.\nAcademy goalkeeper Kornel Misciur could be named in a senior matchday squad for the first time.\nEintracht, meanwhile, announced on Tuesday that midfielder Oscar Hojlund is sidelined \"for the time being\" with a thigh muscle injury.\nHe joins defender Elias Baum on the hosts' injury list, with Dino Toppmoller reporting that otherwise \"the personnel situation generally looks good... we have everyone [else] onboard.\"\nSpeaking at his pre-match press conference, the Eintracht head coach confirmed Michael Zetterer will replace Kaua Santos in goal.\nThe Bundesliga outfit have conceded 24 times in their 10 games so far in 2025-26 and Toppmoller said: \"The number of goals conceded recently was too high, but that didn't have much to do with the goalkeeper.\n\"It's always about the team, and that will be the deciding factor tomorrow and in the coming weeks.\"\nOn facing a Liverpool side seeking to respond to four consecutive defeats, he added: \"They've been the better team in every game recently and have had the better chances. We'll face a world-class team tomorrow.\"\nLast match\nFreiburg 2-2 Eintracht Frankfurt (October 19): Santos, Kristensen, Koch, Amenda, Theate, Larsson, Chaibi, Doan, Uzun, Brown, Burkardt.\nLiverpool 1-2 Manchester United (October 19): Mamardashvili, Bradley, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez, Gravenberch, Mac Allister, Szoboszlai, Salah, Gakpo, Isak.",
