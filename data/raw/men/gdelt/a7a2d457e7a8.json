In the women’s category, Morocco’s Ghizlane Chebbak and Sanaa Mssoudy, along with Nigeria’s Rasheedat Ajibade, are in contention for the top honour.\nHakimi, currently injured, played a key role in Paris Saint-Germain’s historic UEFA Champions League triumph and their runners-up finish at the expanded Club World Cup. The 27-year-old is expected to lead hosts Morocco in the Africa Cup of Nations beginning December 21 as they chase their first title since 1976.\nTwo-time winner Mohamed Salah, who fired Liverpool to their record-equalling 20th Premier League title last season, has had a mixed year. The 33-year-old still clinched the 2024-25 Premier League Golden Boot with 29 goals.\nGalatasaray’s Victor Osimhen has been in exceptional form, though some recent standout performances fall outside the judging deadline of October 15, including a Champions League hat-trick against Ajax and a brace in Nigeria’s World Cup play-off win over Gabon.\nIn the women’s category, Nigeria’s Ajibade shone at the Africa Women’s Cup of Nations, earning the Best Player award after leading her team to a dramatic 3-2 comeback win over hosts Morocco in the final. Chebbak, daughter of former Moroccan star Larbi Chebbak, topped the scoring charts with five goals, while Mssoudy continues to power FAR Rabat, guiding them to a Champions League semi-final berth this weekend.\nThe annual CAF awards ceremony will be held in Rabat on Wednesday, with nominees chosen by CAF committee members, coaches, former players and selected media representatives.",
