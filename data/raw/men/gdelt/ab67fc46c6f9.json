Mainoo’s continued omission has become even more frustrating given United’s midfield woes, as the team has found it extremely difficult to maintain control.\nAfter the final whistle at Craven Cottage, Amorim told reporters that Mainoo is competing against Fernandes for a starting berth.\nA report covered by The Peoples Person relayed that Mainoo is open to leaving United ahead of September 1. He is keen on playing regularly in a bid to secure a spot in the England team, with the 2026 World Cup just around the corner.\nIt’s believed that there is no shortage of interest in the Carrington academy graduate and now, Mike Keegan of the Daily Mail reveals that Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid are keeping close tabs on the situation with a view to snapping him up on loan for the 2025/26 season.\nReal Madrid and Atletico Madrid eyeing Mainoo\nAccording to Keegan, “Daily Mail Sport understands that Real Madrid and Atletico are keeping tabs on the England international, who is struggling for game time under Ruben Amorim.”\n“Sources have disclosed that a season-long loan move could be of interest to those in the Spanish capital, with the transfer window due to close on Monday.”\n“While the player is open to remaining at United, he wants first team football and is also open to a move that would promise Champions League action.”\nKeegan however notes that United are unlikely to allow Mainoo to leave as they’re not actively looking to sell him this summer.\nUnited would only contemplate a permanent transfer and they have no desire to agree a loan deal.\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
