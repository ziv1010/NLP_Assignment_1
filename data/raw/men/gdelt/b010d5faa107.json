He was a class above I thought when he came off the bench, easily Newcastle’s best player and biggest threat, the only NUFC player to beat his man time and again, plus the only one to put the ball into the back of the net. That ‘offside’ decision, laughable, but not amusing in the slightest.\nThere was one other massive positive and maybe it has gone under the radar due to losing the match and of course everything else becoming small beer in comparison.\nWhen Alexander Isak came on, it was part of a double substitution, Botman on for the injured Lascelles.\nThis was the Newcastle United back four back together at last, for the first time in three months.\nKieran Trippier right-back, Fabian Schar right sided centre-back, Sven Botman left sided centre-back, Dan Burn at left-back.\nI think many fans underestimate just how important this unit are.\nHaving a settled defence who work as a unit, all know each other’s games and most importantly, are absolutely bloody excellent.\nThis Newcastle United back four were the very best in the Premier League last season.\nFinal 2022/23 Premier League table\nOnly Manchester City conceding as few goals as this Newcastle United back four.\nLast season, Kieran Trippier started all 38 Premier League matches, Fabian Schar 36, Sven Botman 35, Dan Burn 35.\nThis is what they helped produce to get top four and Champions League qualification.\nNewcastle United 2022/23 Home and Away Premier League breakdown\nHome PL form\nPlayed 19 Won 11 Drawn 6 Lost 2 Goals For 36 Goals Against 14\nAway PL form\nPlayed 19 Won 8 Drawn 8 Lost 3 Goals For 32 Goals Against 19\nCompare that to this season…\nNewcastle United 2023/24 Home and Away Premier League breakdown\nHome PL form\nPlayed 9 Won 8 Drawn 0 Lost 1 Goals For 22 Goals Against 4\nAway PL form\nPlayed 9 Won 1 Drawn 2 Lost 6 Goals For 14 Goals Against 18\nNobody can argue with Newcastle United’s brilliant home form. That includes the defending, only four conceded in nine home games is outstanding. Eddie Howe’s side have dominated so many matches at St James’ Park, which massively helps a defence of course, with often so little to do at the back.\nIn away matches of course, your defence is almost for sure going to be put under much more scrutiny / pressure.\nWith less than half of the away matches played, the Newcastle United back four (and the rest of the team) have conceded 18 goals already, just one less than the away total for all 19 PL matches on the road last season.\nThat stunning 3-0 away win in the cup at Man Utd was achieved with the help of a Newcastle United back four of Livramento Krafth, Dummett and Targett (Almiron subbed on after five minutes and Hall becoming left-back of a back four).\nApart from that bizarre away victory, Eddie Howe’s side have only kept two other clean sheets away from home this season. They came only five days apart, in two very different arenas, the San Siro and Bramall Lane.\nYes, AC Milan 0 Newcastle 0 and then Sheffield United 0 Newcastle 8.\nThose were the last two games when the stellar Newcastle United back four of last season, all started together.\nThere was even a few massive cherries on top of that eight goal icing, with regards to the Newcastle United back four. As Dan Burn scored his first NUFC away goal in the Premier League, Sven Botman scored his first ever Newcastle United goal, whilst Kieran Trippier got a hat-trick of assists.\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\nWell, the massive thing that did go wrong was Sven Botman going on the injury list for three months and I think fair to say, the Newcastle United back four has never really looked the same, certainly away from home.\nI am not saying that having this quartet potentially back together on a regular basis will be an instant cure for all.\nHowever, what I think it could do, is if this Newcastle United back four can play together week in week out, then it is a massive positive and can provide a great base to build on for the second half of the season, especially away from home…\nStats via BBC Sport:\nLuton 1 Newcastle 0 – Saturday 23 December 3pm\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nLuton:\nTownsend 25\nPossession was Luton 35% Newcastle 65%\nTotal shots were Luton 16 Newcastle 15\nShots on target were Luton 5 Newcastle 2\nCorners were Luton 6 Newcastle 7\nReferee: Darren England\nAttendance: 11,042 (1,100 Newcastle)\nNewcastle team v Luton:\nDubravka, Trippier, Lascelles (Botman 37), Schar, Burn (Hall 85), Bruno, Longstaff, Lewis Miley (Isak 37), Almiron (Livramento 81), Gordon, Wilson\nUnused subs:\nKarius, Dummett, Ritchie, Krafth, Alex Murphy\n(How is this Alexander Isak ‘goal’ offside?
