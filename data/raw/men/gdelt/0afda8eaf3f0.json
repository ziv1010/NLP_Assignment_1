Arteta’s men hold a two-point advantage over Man City, though if they win their game in hand at home to Everton on Wednesday night, will extend the gap to five.\nArsenal added strength in depth in the winter window through the arrivals of Jakub Kiwior, Jorginho and Leandro Trossard.\nHowever, none of that trio can stake a claim to being in Arteta’s strongest eleven when all are fit.\nArsenal had higher profile targets in mind two months ago, not least Brighton’s Moises Caicedo and Mykhailo Mudryk, with the lattes ultimately joining Chelsea.\nThe money was clearly there to spend, and per the Times, Arsenal will go big at season’s end.\nThe newspaper report Arsenal are sizing up a four-man spending spree, with two additions to be made in central midfield, one at left-back and one on the flanks.\nArsenal eyeing £150m midfield destroyers\nThe biggest expenditure is likely to come in the engine room with the report reaffirming Arsenal are ‘confident’ of winning the Declan Rice sweepstakes.\nWest Ham are internally resigned to the fact they’ll lose Rice in the summer, per the Athletic. The 24-year-old has suitors in Man Utd, Liverpool and Chelsea too, though the odds are against each of those teams.\nThat’s because Rice is known to both favour remaining in London and playing in the Champions League. Barring a late-season surge from Chelsea, Arsenal will be the only club who can tick those two boxes next season.\nThe Times reckon Rice could cost around £80m. Other outlets have stated he might break the £100m barrier, though that’ll only transpire if there’s a bidding war.\nElsewhere, the Times tout the prospect of Arsenal going back in for Moises Caicedo.\nBoth Arsenal and Chelsea lodged big bids for Caicedo in January, though Brighton refused to sell mid-season at any price.\nArsenal’s final bid for Caicedo was worth £70m and if Brighton prove more receptive to a summer sale, Rice and Caicedo could complete Arteta’s midfield overhaul to the tune of roughly £150m.\nAdditions at left-back and in the forwards are also on the agenda, though who they’d target specifically isn’t suggested.\nLeft-back signing to work in Newcastle’s favour?\nHowever, a new arrival at left-back could have grave consequences for two Arsenal stars.\nThe report adds both Kieran Tierney and Nuno Tavares could be axed to make way for signing competition for Oleksandr Zinchenko.\nTierney, 25, has consistently struggled with injury since arriving from Celtic for £25m back in 2019. However, he has been a shining light when fit and firing.\nFootball Insider recently reported Newcastle are sizing up the Scotland international who is now valued around the £30m mark.\nTierney’s European experience could prove essential at St. James’ Park from next season onwards and the Mirror later added weight to the Newcastle claims.\nFabrizio Romano stated decisions on Tierney and Tavares will be made at season’s end. Tavares is currently on loan at Marseille and is in the midst of a truly remarkable patch of form.\nTavares has scored six times in Ligue 1 this campaign from left wing-back. However, despite his superb form, he may have already burned his bridges back at Arsenal.\nFrench outlet L’Equipe reported Arteta and his coaching staff were often left annoyed and exasperated by Tavares’ behaviour in his maiden season at the Emirates last term.\nWhat’s more, the player himself recently admitted he pushed for an option to buy to be included in his Marseille loan, presumably so he could draw a line under his Arsenal stint for good.\nGiven Tavares’ excellent form this campaign, Marseille may well be in the mix for a permanent move if the Portuguese is a fall guy in Arsenal’s overhaul.\nA third Arsenal exit to help pave the way for a summer spree, per the Times, is Albert Sambi Lokonga.\nThe Belgian is currently out on loan at Crystal Palace and two new midfield additions – combined with the presence of Thomas Partey, Granit Xhaka and Jorginho – would make him expendable.\nREAD MORE: Arsenal target agrees deal, as Fabrizio Romano confirms cost of signing winger",
