A million pairs of trainers and flip-flops have worn down the orange surface, revealing rich undertones of rust and ochre. The goals at either end lost their nets decades ago. The basketball backboards have it worse than that; they don’t even have hoops.\nAdvertisement\nThere is, though, an undeniable charm to the place, even on a quiet weekday morning. It is not hard to imagine it in the evenings, lit up by street lamps and teeming with teenagers. Trees lean over the patchy wire fencing as if trying to secure a better view before the start of the show.\nThis is where everything started for one of the Premier League’s best young players.\nGabriel Martinelli was born a stone’s throw from here. His former school is just around the corner.\nIf his name is not yet synonymous with the neighbourhood, it is only because his status — in Brazil at least — has not quite caught up with the magnitude of his ability.\nThat could be about to change, however. Four years on from his arrival in England, Martinelli appears ready to kick on.\nAlready, at 22, he is a key figure at Arsenal — a point rammed home on Sunday when he returned from missing five matches through injury to produce a match-winning cameo against Manchester City. He has added consistency and goals to his game without forgoing the electric thrill of his wing play. He is likely to get his first taste of Champions League football in the next couple of weeks and will be hopeful of adding to his seven international caps in the months ahead.\nIt is no real stretch to say that superstardom beckons.\nIt is worth pausing, though, to reflect on his path to this point.\nDuring the summer, The Athletic travelled to Sao Paulo to visit the places — and people — that made Martinelli the player he is today.\nThe court\nYou can’t fully grasp Martinelli’s story without knowing about the court. Between the ages of three and six, he spent hundreds of hours here. He would come with friends but mainly with his father, Joao Carlos. Together, they practised shooting, passing, heading, first touch.\nOften, they trained in the dead of night. A group of Bolivian immigrants liked to play on long past sunset, so the Martinellis might only get onto the court at 11pm — sometimes even later. When they did, Joao Carlos ensured no moment was wasted.\nAdvertisement\nAfter getting to grips with the basics, Martinelli would work on his weaker foot. Bang, bang, bang, shot after shot after shot. He never complained, but it was a lot for a young kid. Sometimes, by the end of the session, there would be tears hiding in the corners of his eyes.\nThis was the first stage in what came to be known as ‘the project’ — a sequence of steps designed to make a top-level footballer of Martinelli. For Martinelli Sr, who had to get up at 5am for his job as a toolmaker, those late nights were not just a commitment; they were an investment.\nThey were also, in large part, a reaction to his own story.\nMartinelli Sr is obsessed with football. He always has been. “If I see a group of kids kicking a ball around, I stop and watch,” he tells The Athletic. “It’s in my veins.”\nAs a kid, he played in central midfield. He was gifted — “better than a lot of footballers who are rich today” — but family circumstances meant he never stood a chance of turning his passion into a career. He started working at age 10, selling ice lollies on the street so his parents could buy small quantities of rice and beans for dinner. Money and time were equally tight.\n“My dad used to tell me that football was for layabouts,” he explains. “There was no way for me to pursue it. I never even had the chance to play for a proper team, let alone impress a scout.”\nThat sense of frustration stayed with him. It percolated until Gabriel came along in 2001.\n“I hoped that he would like football, and that he would be good at it,” Martinelli Sr says. “When he was two, you could already see that he had something. That made me very happy. And so I started thinking, planning.”\nThose marathon sessions at the court were shaped by lofty ambitions.\nTake the drills to improve Martinelli’s left foot, for example.\nAdvertisement\n“I always told him that a professional footballer has to be able to shoot with both feet,” says Martinelli Sr. “You’re not going to be perfect on your weaker side, but you need to have it as an option. He would take 150 shots, left foot only. It sounds like I’m exaggerating, but I’m not.”\nThis, clearly, is not one of those classic, slightly dog-eared tales of Brazilian footballers getting by on innate talent and street wit alone.\n“God-given ability is not enough,” says Martinelli Sr. “You have to train, do the work. Gabriel understood that at an early age. He had discipline and he listened. He must have thought I was a son of a b***h sometimes, but he never moaned. Never one word in frustration. Today, you can see that all of that work paid off.”\nIt is worth emphasising that all of this came before Martinelli had even played for an organised team. When he did take that step, joining the futsal setup at leading Sao Paulo club Corinthians as a six-year-old, his father knew that the grind had been worth it.\n“You could see the difference,” says Martinelli Sr. “Whichever side the ball fell to him, he could hit it. He wasn’t just good; he was spectacular.”\nGuarulhos\nIf you follow Rua Angola up the hill from the court, then take a right and a left, you arrive at Martinelli’s childhood home.\nHomes, in fact, for there are three small buildings clustered around a little courtyard, all of them belonging to the family. Martinelli’s aunt, cousins and grandfather still live there, as does Nina the dog. The place, which looks out over a collage of rooftops to the west, is modest but welcoming.\nThe same is true of the area. Guarulhos is often mistaken for a neighbourhood of Sao Paulo — a city so big that it seems to have its own gravitational pull — but it has an identity and history all of its own.\nAdvertisement\nIt is a centre for blue-collar industry, studded with factories and manufacturing plants, prosperous in a gritty kind of way. Since 1985, it has also been home to one of South America’s busiest airports, which has been the catalyst for growth and urban sprawl.\n“A small city destined to be big,” is how a local taxi driver describes it to The Athletic.\nMartinelli lived here until he was 14. He used to kick the ball around in this courtyard, using a small gate as a goal. The family watched World Cup games on a television that they wired up in the same yard. Martinelli would tell anyone who would listen that he would be playing in matches like that one day.\nEarly on, after graduating from the court, he played for several teams simultaneously. Alongside Corinthians, he turned out for VDO, a team started by engineers at a car workshop, and trained at a soccer school loosely affiliated with Sao Paulo FC for a couple of years.\nLeandro Germano was one of his coaches at the school. Germano is at pains to downplay his role in Martinelli’s ascent but has a clear recollection of his potential.\n“Even in the under-nines, you could see that Gabriel was on another level,” Germano tells The Athletic.\nWe are perched on a bench in the back room of the school’s clubhouse. Kids stream past the door, clearly excited ahead of their afternoon run-about.\nGermano recalls an occasion on which Martinelli only had time to play the first half of a game before heading off to represent Corinthians.\n“He scored nine times, then left,” he says with a grin. “That made a real impression on everyone. He was out of this world.”\nIn terms of style, Martinelli was already a lot like the player we know today. Skilful, yes, but also direct and no-nonsense — ‘objective’, to use the word favoured in Brazil.\n“He was always a dribbler,” says Germano. “He liked to go at his man, one on one, but he wasn’t the kind of player who dribbled for the sake of it. Only if it allowed him to get a shot off. He loved scoring goals. It didn’t matter how the ball went in, as long as he scored.”\nThat chimes with the memories of Martinelli Sr.\nAdvertisement\n“He had this desire,” his father says. “There was no such thing as a lost cause. He went for every ball like it was his last meal.”\nCollege\nAt 11, Martinelli was awarded a scholarship at Colegio Nahim Ahmad, a private school famous in the region for its sporting prowess. Former pupils include Arsenal sporting director Edu and Gabi Nunes, who was in the Brazil squad at the Women’s World Cup this summer.\nFor three years, Martinelli was the star of the college’s futsal side, strutting his stuff on the squeaky floor of its indoor sports hall.\n“He was younger than the others, but he was the darling of the team and the fans,” says Eduardo Vela, his coach at the time. Joao Victor Parizoto, one of his team-mates then, is even more emphatic. “He was really, really special — an absurd talent,” he says. “His level was ridiculous. He basically did whatever he wanted on the court.”\nMartinelli was so good that Vela designed certain set moves around him. One involved the other outfield players dragging their markers to the far corners of the court and Martinelli dropping right back next to his own area.\n“The idea was that the goalkeeper would pass to Gabriel, who would dribble past that first man and create an overload straight away,” Vela explains. On at least one occasion, says Parizoto, Martinelli ended up beating the entire opposition team single-handedly.\nOff the court, he was scampish, always nutmegging people in the corridors with a ball of scrunched-up paper. “He was smaller than all the other kids but he was the ringleader,” explains Vela. “He orchestrated all the pranks. Everyone loved him.”\nWhen the time came to concentrate, though, Martinelli clicked into a different mode.\n“He always had this amazing temperament,” recalls Ilidio de Souza, who used to ferry Martinelli and his team-mates all over Sao Paulo for tournaments in the school minibus. “The jokes were for off the court; on it, he was always serious. He knew what he wanted from his life. It’s not down to luck that he is where he is today.”\nAdvertisement\nVela concurs: “You know the intensity he plays with today? He had that as a boy. He was very responsible. He set a really good example.”\nThat applied to other sports, too. On one occasion, after playing futsal in the morning, Martinelli was parachuted into the athletics squad to fill a gap in the sprint relay team. After a quick lesson in baton-passing, he helped the team win a bronze medal. “It wasn’t really his thing, but he was so fast,” says Vela. “Who knows, maybe he would have been even better at athletics than he is at football.”\nHe was less impressive as a student. “Gabriel was average — very average,” laughs Vela. He was clever, just not hugely engaged. This was a point of contention at home.\n“I always told him that he needed a Plan B, in case he didn’t make it in football,” recalls Martinelli Sr. “We used to have the same conversation over and over again. I would tell him, ‘Gabriel, you have to get interested in something else. Engineering, medicine, law… something. Just something else you can have up your sleeve. Have a look on the internet. There’s so much you could do’.\n“At the end, he would always just say he wanted to be a footballer.\n“It scared me. There was never any other path. I don’t know what his life would be like without football.”\nParque Sao Jorge\nCelio Pereira is 65 years old. He has coached futsal at Corinthians for well over three decades, helping countless brilliant youngsters progress through the ranks. Martinelli, though, is up near the top of his list.\n“It was like God sent him to me,” he tells The Athletic.\nThe pair started working together halfway through 2007, when Pereira received a tip-off about a sparky little striker in Guarulhos. After speaking to his coach at VDO, he called Martinelli Sr and asked him to bring his son in for a trial at Parque Sao Jorge, Corinthians’ riverside training complex.\nAdvertisement\n“He was a miniature phenomenon,” says Pereira. “I needed a forward pivot, a kid who could score a lot of goals, and he was perfect. During his trial, he scored four or five times in every training session. He could beat a man with skill in tight spaces. He was tiny but quick — incredibly quick — and skilful.”\nA photo taken a few months after that first trial illustrates the size point.\nMartinelli is dwarfed by the Sao Paulo state championship trophy. The medal around his neck hangs down to his waist. He is a dot of a human.\nA further picture, framed in the Martinellis’ home, shows him three years later, playing for the under-nines. He wears the No 9 jersey, tucked into his shorts, and white Nike trainers. He is lining up a shot with his left foot, intent etched on his face. He still looks like he would fit inside a pint glass.\nPer Pereira’s records, Martinelli scored 35 goals in his first half-season. The next year, in the under-sevens, he hit 66 in around 25 games. That rose to 80 in 2009. He had different coaches in the years that followed, but Pereira says he was always the top scorer on the team. “He evolved every year,” he says.\nAt Corinthians, seven times champions of Brazil and twice Club World Cup winners, Martinelli learned to cope with the scrutiny that is an unavoidable part of playing for a big club.\n“I was worried about that with him,” says Martinelli Sr. “I remember his first tournament, in 2007. The place was overflowing with those crazy, unbalanced parents who scream at other people’s children.\n“It’s a lot for a young kid to cope with, but he wasn’t troubled by it at all. It was all so natural for him. He went out there, destroyed the opposition, scored goals, did his celebrations. Some people shrink when the pressure is on, but he grew.”\nAs time went on, as his overall goal tally ticked up towards 200, Martinelli’s name began to precede him.\nAdvertisement\nMartinelli Sr, however, was keen to keep his feet planted on the ground. He pointed to the example of Lulinha, a much-hyped winger who burst onto the scene at Corinthians as a teenager but then failed to deliver on his promise.\n“He (Lulinha) was the golden boy,” says Martinelli Sr. “Everyone was talking about him when he broke through. He scored so many goals at youth level. But what did he go on to achieve? I always reminded Gabriel that it wasn’t just about talent. There are so many other factors.”\nPereira believes that Martinelli heeded the lesson. “He was a smart boy, dedicated,” he says. “At the end of every session, he would ask whether he’d done well and what he could do better. He was so keen to improve.”\nEven 14 years after their last season together, Pereira speaks about Martinelli with real tenderness. He remembers squad trips to Mairipora, a fishing resort just to the north of Sao Paulo, where his friend was always in his element.\n“Gabriel loved it there,” he says. “He was my fishing partner. I think he would have happily gone there for every holiday.”\nToday, Pereira follows Martinelli’s career from afar with a mix of admiration and pride.\n“I’m always rooting for him,” he concludes. “When he was called up to Brazil’s World Cup squad (last year), I sent him a message to congratulate him. He replied, thanking me. He’s still a great kid. I always knew he had a really bright future.”\nWhere everything is big\nItu creeps up on you.\nOne minute, you think you have it pinned as one of those small, sleepy Brazilian satellite towns — a de facto dormitory for people who spend the week working in Sao Paulo, 80 kilometres (50 miles) to the south east, or in nearby Campinas. The next, you’re staring at a 20-metre (65ft) high phone booth in its main square, wondering what the hell is going on.\nAdvertisement\nKeep walking around and you will see a giant traffic light, pencils the size of golf bags for sale in shops and something called the Park of Exaggerations, which is full of towering models of beer cans and bees, cupcakes and teapots. The effect is cumulative and more than a little trippy.\nThis is the city’s little gimmick: Itu, as its residents will tell you, is “where everything is big”. What started as a niche reference to a 1960s TV show — a comedian called Simplicio played a hubristic country bumpkin who continually boasted that things were bigger and better back home in Itu — is now a way of drumming up tourism.\nYou could easily argue that Itu’s football ground is also oversized, at least relative to the team that plays there. The Estadio Novelli Junior can hold up to 18,000 people — around a tenth of the city’s population. Ituano FC, however, very rarely come close to filling it.\nThe club are in Brazil’s second division, but that is a bit of an outlier. As recently as 2018, they were outside the national pyramid altogether, having failed to qualify for the 64-team Serie D. They have never played in the top flight.\nBig clubs such as Corinthians have a magnetic pull within the Brazilian youth system. Youngsters who impress for regional sides like Ituano are often lured away by the promise of better coaching, more modern facilities and, eventually, greater cachet on the national scene. It is highly unusual for a player to go the other way, unless he has been released.\nThat, though, is precisely what Martinelli did at the age of 14.\nIt was, says Martinelli Sr, the logical consequence of a wider family plan.\nHe had just retired and was keen to get out of Guarulhos. “I wanted a quieter life, more peace,” he says. “I spoke with my wife, spoke with Gabriel, and they both agreed. So we moved to Itu.”\nAdvertisement\nThe decision raised a few eyebrows, not least at Corinthians, but Martinelli Sr was confident it would not hinder his son’s progress.\n“I wasn’t worried about him leaving a big club,” his father explains. “People would tell me that he would be forgotten, that he wouldn’t get picked for the Brazil junior teams, but that’s not so important. I told him, ‘When you show what you can do in senior football, no one will care that you’re not at Corinthians’.\n“I always believed in him. Talent will always find a way. I thought that living in Itu and playing for a smaller club might actually benefit him.”\nMartinelli’s first point of contact at Ituano, their under-15s coach Luiz Antonio Moraes, held a similar view.\n“If a young player starts to stand out here, there’s a good chance he’ll get an opportunity in the senior side, which isn’t always the case at a club like Corinthians,” he tells The Athletic, looking out across the pristine turf at the Novelli Junior. “The competition for places is much higher at the big clubs. They often have 50 youngsters in every age category, compared to 25 here. So players have a real opportunity to develop at a club like this.”\nMoraes was bowled over by Martinelli (or “Ga”, as he calls him) right from the get-go.\nHe remembers his first goal for the under-15s — a curling shot into the far corner after a run in from the left — and says that the other kids warmed to him immediately. “He came in and won everyone over in a couple of training sessions,” he says. “He was a little gem.”\nMoraes, who subsequently worked with Martinelli at under-17, under-20 and senior levels, loved the youngster’s speed and directness. But above all, he adored his attitude.\n“Ga trained like crazy,” he says. “Sometimes I would test him, without him knowing. We always have a lot of triallists here, and I would put him in a team full of weaker players. They would lose and he would get mad, really angry. He would ask to do extra work at the end of the session, but I wouldn’t let him.\nAdvertisement\n“So when it came to the game at the weekend, he was hungry, desperate to score goals. He doesn’t even know I did that on purpose.”\nThere were a few rough edges that needed smoothing off: Martinelli was prone to over-elaborating in possession and could be bumped off the ball by more physical opponents. Moraes told him he needed to be snappier in his decision-making. In time, the little improvements added up.\nBefore Martinelli even played for Ituano’s first team, the path to Europe was beckoning. He travelled to England on four separate occasions to train with Manchester United, even playing a friendly for their under-18 team. Martinelli had his heart set on a move to Old Trafford. In the end, however, United decided not to pursue a deal. It was a similar story with Barcelona, with whom he subsequently spent a fortnight.\n“He was sad when the United move didn’t work out, but it didn’t last long,” says Moraes. “But he just kept working. Maybe even more than before. Ga is a great example for all young players. Things never went to his head.”\nThe rest is something like history.\nMartinelli put the disappointments behind him, made his senior debut at 16, ripped up the Sao Paulo state championship the following year and earned a move to Arsenal. Now, four years on from that transfer, he looks ready to secure his place among the Premier League’s very best players.\nNot that he has changed all that much.\n“When I watch him today, I could still be watching that 15-year-old kid who arrived at Ituano,” says Moraes with a smile. “He has the same characteristics. He still does those dribbles in from the wing. Ga has this nose for the goal: if he’s out wide, he always wants to go in on that diagonal.\n“He’s the same kid, just with a different body, stronger. Being in England has helped him: he now does even more work for the team. The Premier League has made him a more complete player.”\nAdvertisement\nThe appreciation is personal as well as professional. Moraes and Martinelli still exchange messages. Whenever the latter returns to Itu — his parents and younger sister still live in the city — he drops by the club to give his old mentor a gift. “He is a really caring kid,” says Moraes. “It’s a nice friendship.”\nAs for Martinelli Sr, his thoughts inevitably return to those endless early evenings spent on the court, when the future and its possibilities stretched out in front of his son.\n“Everything Gabriel has achieved is down to his own effort,” he says. “His commitment is incredible. He has been preparing for this since he was three years old. I get goosebumps just thinking about it.”\n(Top photos: Naomi Baker/Getty Images, the Martinelli family; design: Sam Richardson)",
