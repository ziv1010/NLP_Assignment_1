Bilbao is one of those places. Been there a number of times and have friends there.\nDon't really understand why anyone would automatically want a team to win just because they were from the same country.\n4 Posted 01/05/2025 at 20:06:00\n5 Posted 01/05/2025 at 20:07:23\nI don't really have much affiliation to England. I identify as British. That's what my passport says and the flag I served under.\nI'll keep an eye on Chelsea tonight as well, but that's a family thing. My cousin, born in Liverpool and his parents from Speke, grew up in Battersea is a huge supporter.\nSupport Satan. No chance.\n6 Posted 01/05/2025 at 20:32:23\n7 Posted 01/05/2025 at 20:32:58\nThey've been the better side.\n8 Posted 01/05/2025 at 20:42:06\n9 Posted 01/05/2025 at 20:43:11\n10 Posted 01/05/2025 at 20:47:23\n11 Posted 01/05/2025 at 20:50:30\nI haven't looked, but it would be interesting to see what the percentage of English players for both teams are.\nPortugese and Australian managers.\nMan Utd's support base are global and half of Tottenham's are from Cyprus.\n12 Posted 01/05/2025 at 20:51:25\n13 Posted 01/05/2025 at 20:56:12\n14 Posted 01/05/2025 at 20:59:11\n15 Posted 01/05/2025 at 21:00:46\nTHE difference in class between Bilbao and United was huge when they had equal teams it’s massive now like the difference in class between this match and the two we’ve seen in the European Champions games this week.\n16 Posted 01/05/2025 at 21:02:40\n17 Posted 01/05/2025 at 21:08:28\nEverton have one of the highest percentage of English players in the top flight.\nDespite my disconcerting for England I find it quite sad that as a nation of nearly 58 million, England can't compete with their own players.\nI admire Forest for the the season they've had but always thought they would tail off. I hope they qualify for Europe, but I don't think it will be Champions League.\n18 Posted 01/05/2025 at 21:08:33\n19 Posted 01/05/2025 at 21:09:36\n20 Posted 01/05/2025 at 21:14:05\n21 Posted 01/05/2025 at 21:41:37\n22 Posted 01/05/2025 at 21:46:40\nNot so long ago people were berating Moyes for not \"aspiring\" to be like them.\n23 Posted 01/05/2025 at 21:48:34\nFootball is an absolute joke.\n24 Posted 01/05/2025 at 22:03:37\nI say Forest, because I believe it's within his reach to emulate them and I also think that it will be easier for Everton to move forward by playing with a similar system to the one that Forest have been using this season.\nThe basis is there, we are already as good as most teams defensively, so hopefully he his given the funds to buy a couple of players with pace and a couple more players with a little bit of craft.\nIf he his allowed to purchase a few players like this then I see no reason why Everton, can't be the surprise package next season.\nI live in hope, especially when I look at tonight's results and see two teams around us in the table both looking comfortable in their quest to qualify for a European final.\n25 Posted 01/05/2025 at 22:12:09\nLet's hope Moyes has clarity in his plans and clarity in the profile of player he's after. Pace, especially in the wide areas, will hopefully be high on his agenda.\n26 Posted 01/05/2025 at 23:50:56\nCan I add my name to the folk on here who are enjoying Forest's demise.\n27 Posted 01/05/2025 at 23:53:38\nBut I see that it looks like 2 teams in the Premier League's bottom third will contest a European final and the club currently 14th in the Premier League just slaughtered the the team who are 4th in La Liga in their manor.\n28 Posted 02/05/2025 at 00:16:03\n29 Posted 02/05/2025 at 06:03:04\nThe Premier League has, by and large become a tough and mundane watch at times.\nI'll never pass up or give up on Everton, but I often switch to the Bundesliga or English lower leagues.\n30 Posted 02/05/2025 at 09:06:36\nI'd agree with that but I wouldn't be at all surprised if Moyes still prioritised the defence ahead of next season.\n31 Posted 02/05/2025 at 09:45:54\nIn personal conversations with a few, I remain sceptical as to whether Moyes can change.\nI personally don't think so. To that end, I'm with you on your guesstimation that he will prioritise not losing before winning.\nHe may have been right for us this season and could succeed next season. But I don't think he is brave enough.\n32 Posted 02/05/2025 at 10:06:27\n'My point isn't necessarily that the Premier League is shit, more aimed at English football, which is still dining off 1966.'\nWhat I enjoyed in those far-off days were the shots from range and the goals they produced. Charlton's efforts live in the memory as did many Dutch players at the time. Shots from outside the box, not trying to walk the ball into the net!\n33 Posted 02/05/2025 at 10:21:53\nAlright for now and that is all.\n34 Posted 02/05/2025 at 10:55:42\nDue to departures and spending constraints, we will probably start next season with a squad quality that is between about 12th and 15th.\nIf he does prioritise the goals against column that might be boring – but it is probably the best way to over perform the quality of our squad and give us a chance of qualifying for Europe.\n35 Posted 02/05/2025 at 11:28:56\nOnly approximately 30% of players in the Premier League are English. Compare that with 65% of Germans in the Bundesliga.\nWhen I look at smaller nations, population wise, like the Netherlands, Belgium and Croatia with the players they produce, it puts England to shame.\nRobert @34. Totally. Despite my well documented reservations about Moyes, past and present, he is not at fault for the wrongs at Everton. They are far more deep rooted than that.\nBut I can criticise him for his safety-first approach. It isn't a recipe for success. And there has been no excuse since we were practically safe on 34 points.\nWhy put the handbrake on, when you can entertain the crowd?\n36 Posted 02/05/2025 at 11:34:31\nThe answer might be that Moyes thinks the squad is total shit and not capable of entertaining football without getting a hiding.\n37 Posted 02/05/2025 at 11:56:01\nI still haven't gotten over the surrender to Liverpool in the semi-final against them when they were there for the taking.\nThe final straw was not turning up in the quarter-final against Wigan. That was me finally done with him.\nI am hoping to meet my second cousin in the summer. I'll give him my view.\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
