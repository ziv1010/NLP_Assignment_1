He was the top scorer in Spain last season but on the evidence of this first half his movement needs to improve. He needs to be making more runs for his side to pick out.”\nDovbyk’s moment will come for Ukraine at Euro 2024\nDovbyk was one of the breakout stars of the 2023/24 season as the Ukrainian striker fired Girona to an unlikely UEFA Champions League finish, creating history and potentially laying down the groundwork for a new force in Spanish football.\nWhilst the forward is yet to come good at the Euros, Dovbyk’s moment will come for Ukraine, who after their win against Slovakia now look like a safe bet to qualify for the round of 16 stage of the tournament.\nIndeed, Dovbyk has shown sparks at the Euros this summer, and whilst Morrison wasn’t impressed with the Arsenal-linked forward’s display, the 27-year-old attacker will have more opportunities to show his quality.",
