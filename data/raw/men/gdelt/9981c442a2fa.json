  "body_text": "Wayne Rooney heaped praise on Marc Cucurella following Chelsea’s 3-0 victory over ten-man Barcelona, saying the defender produced the best performance he had seen from a left-back in a ‘long, long time’.\nEstevao stole much of the limelight with another scintillating individual performance on a memorable night for the Stamford Bridge faithful, with Enzo Maresca’s men rising to fifth in the table.\nThe Brazilian teenager shone throughout the first half and doubled Chelsea’s lead with a moment of brilliance in the 55th minute after Jules Kounde had earlier fired into his own net.\nAfter picking up possession out wide on the right, Estevao danced past Pau Cubarsi on the edge of the box before arrowing the ball into the roof of the net from a tight angle.\nAs Chelsea fans proceeded to taunt Lamine Yamal with chants of ‘You’re just a s*** Estevao’, Liam Delap came on and added a third to put the game to bed with 17 minutes remaining of normal time.\nBut while Chelsea’s precocious 18-year-old talent is likely to take the plaudits, Cucurella further underlined his importance to Chelsea with an outstanding performance to keep Yamal quiet at the other end of the pitch.\nCucurella was also instrumental in Barca being reduced to ten men on the stroke of half-time, drawing a foul from Ronald Araujo that gave Slavko Vincic little option but to brandish a second yellow card.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nAnalysing Tuesday’s one-sided Champions League contest on Amazon Prime, Rooney couldn’t speak highly enough of the Chelsea and Spain left-back.\n‘Estevao has probably given Cucurella the best lessons in training that he could have in dealing with Lamine Yamal,’ the ex-Manchester United and England forward began.\n‘Cucurella was absolutely incredible. I think it’s probably the best performance I’ve seen from a left-back for a long, long time.\n‘To do that tonight, what he did, he’s a serious player.’\nMetro at the Match: Chelsea 3-0 Barcelona\nMetro's Ben Fleming breaks down the action with the winners and losers from Stamford Bridge:\nNeto impresses in new role\nGiven the start as the central striker with Joao Pedro and Liam Delap benched, Pedro Neto was a livewire up in attack. A lack of composure let him down at points, but deploying him centrally could be a great option to provide Estevao with more minutes from the start.\nEstevao outshines Yamal\nOnly 18, but Estevao already looks like a man for the big occasion. A winner against Liverpool last month and now a sublime goal to virtually put this game to bed. The Brazilian easily won the battle of the teenage sensations.\nCucurella the cult hero\nA faultless display from Cucurella at left-back. Provided plenty of support to Garnacho in the final third, and kept his fellow countryman Lamine Yamal quiet for virtually the entire 90 minutes. Revered by the fans who sang his name all night long.\nFull Chelsea ratings: Sanchez 7, Gusto 6, Fofana 7, Chalobah 7, Cucurella 8.5, James 6, Caicedo 7, Estevao 9, Fernandez 6, Garnacho 6, Neto 7. Subs: Santos 7, Delap 6, Gittens N/A, Acheampong N/A, George N/A.\nYamal kept quiet\nLost his battle up against Cucurella and struggled to have any real impact on the game. Not helped by his side going down to ten men, but a visit to London to forget for the supremely talented teen, who made way to jeers from all four sides of Stamford Bridge.\nAwful Araujo\nThe rank opposite of a captain's display from Ronald Araujo. Picked up his first yellow for dissent and sent for an early bath before the half-time whistle for a clumsy challenge on Cucurella. Cost his team.\nFull Barcelona ratings: Joan García 5, Kounde 6, Cubarsi 5, Araujo 3, Balde 5; Eric García 5, De Jong 6, Fermin 6, Yamal 5, Lewandowski 5, Ferran Torres 5. Subs: Rashford 5, Raphinha 5, Christensen 5, Martin N/A, Olmo N/A.\nAccording to Rooney, the challenge of facing the likes of Estevao, Cole Palmer and Joao Pedro on a daily basis in training is only going to benefit a player like Cucurella.\nHe explained: ‘It always helped me because when you’re playing against top-class defenders every day in training, in small spaces as well, in smaller games, you have to think quick on your feet.\n‘You have to learn to use your body because you’re up against quick, strong players.\n‘Normally, training is the hardest opposition you have and it makes games a lot easier so I think for Cucurella tonight, he’s had good preparation for this game.’\nRooney made sure to praise Estevao’s magnificent showing on the night, applauding the youngster’s decision-making and ability to keep calm and collected on the big stage.\nMore Trending\n‘Nights like tonight will give him a lot of confidence,’ he said.\n‘But also, the manager has used him really well and sparingly in the Premier League. It isn’t as physical in Europe and he was fantastic tonight.\n‘His decisions to drive with the ball, decisions to run off the ball, to play inside, one touch, but also, defensively, his work-rate was very good as well.\n‘If he keeps doing what he’s doing then he’ll give the manager no option but to play him in every game.’\nMORE: Harry Kane fires warning to Arsenal about Bayern Munich wonderkid Lennart Karl\nMORE: Pep Guardiola speaks out on controversial team selection in Man City defeat\nMORE: Arsenal must be ‘aggressive’ to shut down two Bayern Munich stars, says Jurrien Timber",
