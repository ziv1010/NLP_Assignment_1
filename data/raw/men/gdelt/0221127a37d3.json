  "body_text": "Brentford vs. Liverpool: Premier League 2025-26 Preview & Team News\nLiverpool hope to make it two wins on the bounce with a challenging trip down south\n| Saturday, October 24th |\nPremier League | Brentford Community Stadium\n8PM BST/3PM EST\nLiverpool face both Caoimhín Kelleher, Sepp Van den Berg, and Jordan Henderson on Saturday, with Henderson’s long, direct balls a specific threat against a Liverpool side who have looked shaky in defensive transition thus far this season. The Cherries come into this one on 10 points with a goal difference of -1, but the results belie their threats.\nAaron Hickey has returned to training for the Bees following an injury he picked up away with Scotland, but will likely be unable to feature until the end of October. Antoni Milambo remains out long term with an ACL injury.\nApart from the known players, Yehor Yarmoliuk has been impressive for Brentford, and the Ukrainian international is a threat in the build-up, including with his direct running. Thiago is also one to watch, with six goals in nine thus far this season. Dango Ouattara as well has been a threat for Brentford, and Liverpool will have their hands full on Saturday should the Reds want to continue turning things around.\nPredicted Liverpool Lineup (4-3-3)\nMamardashvili; Bradley, Konaté, Van Dijk, Robertson; Wirtz, Szoboszlai, Jones; Salah, Ekitiké, Gakpo\nArne Slot is “definitely” without Jeremie Frimpong following his hamstring injury midweek, and waits to see about both Alexander Isak and Ryan Gravenberch. Given Brentford’s ability in counter attacking modes, Slot would probably love to have Gravenberch available at the weekend, but will also likely approach this one with caution given the tough tests on the horizon.\nOtherwise, Alisson remains out for the Reds. Miloš Kerkez could come in for Andy Robertson at left back, but many would clamor to see the vice captain get another outing: whilst Kerkez has certainly not been poor in recent weeks, solidity and experience are nonetheless nothing to sniff at in a leaky defense. Should Gravencherh be fit he will expect to start at the base of midfield alongside the likes of Dominik Szoboszlai, and perhaps Curtis Jones has done enough to earn the shirt over Alexis Mac Allister — though the Scouser could miss out in favor of an excellent Florian Wirtz. I expect the manager to go with caution and start Szoboszlai and Jones at the base of the midfield once again, presumably with instructions for more positional awareness when facing counter attacks: both, it must be said, are used to attacking with the safety of a Gravenberch behind them.\nThe big question is around Mohamed Salah, who Slot emphasized is “a human being” in his pre-match press conference. It’s difficult to see Salah — so often a certainty in terms of form and finishing — struggle, and playing away from home will mean it’s hard for supporters to give him the boost he both deserves and perhaps needs. Given that Isak may not be fully fit, it’s likely Salah starts once again (frankly, the midweek lineup initially struck me as wildly attacking as I’d stopped looking for Salah’s name, and thus thought he was out there as well).\nThe Managers Have Their Say\nArne Slot: “I think it’s been a difficult moment for all of us. No-one is used to losing, for all the players that have played here for so many years and even for the new players as well because we started the season with seven wins. If you start to lose once, that’s a difficult moment for everyone, let alone if you [lose] twice, three or four times.”\nKeith Andrews: “For what [Henderson’s] done by coming here, he’s shown a real hunger to still play at the most elite level in world football, because that’s what I think the Premier League is.“\nThe Officials\nReferee: Simon Hooper Assistants: Adrian Holmes, Simon Long Fourth Official: Tim Robinson VAR: Chris Kavanagh Assistant VAR: Simon Bennett\nIf you haven’t done so already, we’d love if you signed up for an SB Nation account and join the community at TLO.
