  "body_text": "Liverpool\nPremier League • England\nLiverpool shatter Man Utd, Man City plans as Klopp leaps into lead for £77m-rated star who can fix key issue\nLiverpool will reportedly look to sign Benfica defender Antonio Silva this summer, after scouting him for several weeks.\nThe 19-year-old has also caught the attention of Manchester City and Manchester United, so the Reds could face competition for his signature.\nSilva only signed a senior deal with Benfica last summer, which is valid until 2027. As a result, a large bid will be required for his services.\nIndeed, as noted by Football Insider, the centre-back has a release clause of £77m in his contract. Now, given three Premier League giants are in the race – Liverpool may have to pay that fee.\nThis season, Silva has made 26 league appearances for Benfica, scoring three goals in the process.\nThe teenager has played a key role in their season – with the Portuguese giants sitting four points clear at the top of the table.\nA strong centre-half with an excellent passing range, Silva could prove to be an excellent long-term addition for Liverpool. But, only if they can beat Man City and Man Utd to signing him.\nREAD MORE: Jurgen Klopp hits back at exit rumours surrounding ‘outstanding’ Liverpool star\nKlopp plots Liverpool defensive revamp\nIt’s no secret that Jurgen Klopp is looking to bolster his defence this summer. Indeed, the manager is allegedly concerned that his back line is too weak to challenge for trophies.\nRecent injuries to Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate have exposed their lack of depth in the centre-back position, with Joe Gomez and Joel Matip struggling to fill in effectively for the duo.\nThis has been one of the key reasons that Klopp’s team currently sit in seventh place in the Premier League table. Although, their aging midfield has also proved to be a problem, too.\nAs noted by TEAMtalk, one of Liverpool’s key defensive targets is Eintracht Frankfurt centre-back Evan Ndicka, who will be available on a free transfer.\nHowever, Napoli are reportedly considering signing Ndicka as a replacement for Kim Min-jae, who could join Man City.\nJosko Gvardiol has also been linked with a switch to Anfield for some time. But, Liverpool have been priced out of a move for the powerhouse after RB Leipzig slapped an £80m price tag on him.\nAs a result, the Reds may have to look elsewhere for a new centre-back. Silva certainly has the potential to turn into a top player in the future, so would be an exciting signing.\nFor now, Klopp’s focus will be on qualifying for European football next season. The Champions League is almost definitely out of reach. But, the Europa League and Europa Conference League are still up for grabs.\nRegardless of what happens, though, Liverpool are tipped to rebuild both their defence and midfield in the summer.",
