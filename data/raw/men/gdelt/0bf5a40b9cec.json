  "body_text": "Another manager gone as Everton sack Lampard\nEverton have dismissed Frank Lampard from his position as head coach less than a year into the role following a string of defeats and the club sitting in the relegation zone.\nThe 44-year-old has overseen just three Premier League wins all season, the worst 20-game sequence of results to start a season in the club’s history, and failed to progress past the third round of either domestic cup competition.\nThe decision, made unanimously by Farhad Moshiri and the club’s Board of Directors, came in the wake of Saturday’s 2-0 defeat to West Ham, Everton’s seventh in eight games in all competitions and the first match that the owner had attended since October 2021.\nMoshiri and Chairman Bill Kenwright were non-committal when “door-stepped” by a Sky Sports reporter as they left the stadium after the game at the London Stadium but it was clear that they had to make the seventh sacking of a non-caretaker manager in the British-Iranian’s time at Everton.\nThe decision comes a year and a week after Rafael Benitez was given his marching orders after just seven months in the post. Leighton Baines and Paul Tait are expected to take the immediate training sessions beginning tomorrow afternoon.\nLampard’s departure marks a sad end to a managerial tenure that held so much promise in its early days and which reached its peak on an emotional night at Goodison last May when the Toffees secured their Premier League survival with a stunning come-from-behind win over Crystal Palace.\nThe former Derby County and Chelsea manager had been commended for the way he had tapped into the passion of the Everton faithful and there were high hopes that he could continue to develop both his management skills but also the Blues’ squad this season.\nHowever, having lost his best player last summer when Richarlison was sold to Tottenham Hotspur, Lampard was dealt a cruel blow just three days before the start of the 2022-23 campaign when Dominic Calvert-Lewin, a big miss for much of the previous season, suffered another serious injury and wasn’t really able to recover full fitness until this month.\nThe failure on the club’s part not to sign a reliable goalscorer of Calvert-Lewin’s ilk, acquiring instead Neal Maupay from Brighton, further hampered the manager’s attempts to build a winning side, even as it appeared he was making progress when Palace came to Goodison Park again last October and were swept aside with an impressive display that yielded a 3-0 win for Everton.\nThat was the last time Everton won under his stewardship and they have since dropped from 12th place to 19th, with games running out to arrest their alarming form and mount another bid to avoid what would be a catastrophic drop into the Championship.\nAssuming no one has been lined up already, Everton will now embark on the search for their eighth managerial appointment in 10 years, with the likes of Sean Dyche, Nuno Espirito Santo, Wayne Rooney, Marcelo Bielsa and Duncan Ferguson among the names favoured by bookmakers in the latest odds.\nWhile it was suggested by the Daily Mail's Dominic King that Dyche was not being considered and Espirito Santo is currently locked into a role at Al-Ittihad in Saudi Arabia with a £7m release clause, The Guardian's Andy reports that Dyche could be an option along with ex-Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl.\nReader Comments (531)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Can't see a new manager bounce certainly not in the next two games.\n3 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:28:05\n4 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:28:23\nWho's next for the meat grinder?\n5 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:28:27\n6 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:28:39\n7 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:30:05\n8 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:30:37\n9 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:31:18\n10 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:31:22\nA few available coaches at the moment:\nMarcelo Gallardo\nMauricio Pochettino\nMarcelo Bielsa (if we decide to go down with a bang!)\nSam Allerdyce (to get us out of trouble on a 6 months contract)\nThomas Tuchel\nProblem is, it will be the same incompetent, clueless people who have got it all wrong in the past few years, are still in charge of finding a successor to FL, so I won't hold my breath!\n12 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:32:15\nThis'll be interesting\n13 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:33:54\n14 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:34:34\n15 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:34:58\n16 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:35:43\nThere is enough qualiy to see us out of the relegation bunch but it needs to be the right appointment and I would trust this bunch of cowardly and indecisive clowns to get it right.\nI assume they havent had anyone lined up so its gonna have to be someone who is available and willing to pick up the poisoned chalice.\n17 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:35:49\n18 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:35:52\nSomeone with a genuine affiliation for the club.\nSomeone whose passion will translate to players and fans alike.\nSomeone who's served as a coach under a top manager(s), learning their trade from them.\nIf onlyâ€¦\n19 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:36:04\n20 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:36:21\n21 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:36:27\n22 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:36:35\n23 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:36:39\n24 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:38:22\n25 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:38:25\nDyche, Duncan, Carsley?\n26 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:39:11\nI have no bloody idea who we should go for but I'm not the one selecting. I never wanted Howe a while ago and how I wish we had given him a go.\nI really don't think Big Dunc is the answer. We need somebody with experience. At least with Dyche he managed well at Burnely for a few years.\n27 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:39:37\nLet's face it, he had his hands tied with our board!\nNot Sure Where we go now. I think Dyche is probably the best option as I think he wouldn't suffer fools gladly and probably won't be afraid to ruffle a few feathers. Maybe not pretty football but his Burnley were always hard to beat.\nNo doubt Moshri will want a foreign manager and Kenwright will want Moyesâ€¦ heaven help us.\n28 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:40:02\nMind you, I would imagine they'll take the usual line of “He's shiteâ€ etc, etc, etc.\n29 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:40:57\nObviously we have slim pickings but let's have a bit of common sense!\n30 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:41:15\nFeel Lampard was only a small part of the problem, but some of his tactics and team selections didn't help. Also in the last few games the defence have looked totally disorganised, maybe with some transfer funds he might have done a little bit better.\nA bigger part of the problem is the board who just haven't got a clue how to run a football club and thew away too much money in the first instance trying to buy success too quickly. The sooner we can get rid of them the better and if it means going down then so be it.\nTime for our DOF to show us he actually knows what he's doing and bring in some young cheap prospects ready for next year when we are in the championship.\nGoing to be a long long season.\n31 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:42:24\n32 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:42:42\n33 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:43:16\n34 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:44:53\n35 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:45:00\n36 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:45:17\n37 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:45:38\nBut they get Everton lol.\nAlso please stop blaming the squad for his sacking! 8 of those are HIS signings!!!\n38 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:47:54\n39 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:48:33\nWe need an experienced Manager. Who that is I'll leave to the Oracle Christy Ring.\n40 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:48:35\n41 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:48:36\n42 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:48:48\n43 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:48:59\n44 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:49:19\n45 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:51:25\n46 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:51:51\n48 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:52:29\n49 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:52:34\n50 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:52:44\nBut please,please don't let it be Ferguson,Rooney,Unsworth or Nuno.\nGet us an experienced manager with just 2 priorities.salvation this year and consolidation next year.\nNeither do I want to see a caretaker manager from inside the club.That's the sure route to the championship as are all the ex-Evertonians whose names are being bandied about.\n51 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:52:45\n52 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:53:03\n53 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:54:09\n54 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:54:33\n55 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:55:38\nThat and DCL missing a lot of games is the main reason we are where we are.\nWe only just stayed up with them in the side most games so it was obvious that it was going to be a struggle.\nGet a no nonsense guy in like Dyche, I don't see the point of getting the same type of manager as we have had for the last 10 or so years.\nI suspect that it might take the second coming of Jesus to save us this season though.\n56 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:57:17\n57 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:57:18\n58 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:57:25\n59 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:57:41\nI want someone who gets Everton points, rather than 'gets Everton'.\nOf course it won't be Dyche, it'll be one of Kia's never-beens\nUnless they surprise us\n60 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:58:10\nPlease god not Dyche\n61 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:58:42\nFFS!\n62 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:59:14\n63 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:59:19\nWhen you look at managers available, players available for transfers on a budget you can see how truly knackered we are.\nOnly we could squander so much money on bog average players. We have been so poorly run and managed it hurts.\n64 Posted 23/01/2023 at 15:59:22\n65 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:01:24\n66 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:01:41\n67 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:01:49\nNo money for top players and so Poch, Tuchel etc are out of the equation\nDunc should not be getting a mention because he has less credentials for this massive job than Frank had.\nDyche has vast experience of gripping a team and playing 2 up top. He can also deal with scraping the barrel for talent which is again where we find ourselves. Millions wasted. Dyche is what we need right now.\n68 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:01:56\n69 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:02:05\nGood riddance to Frank, never liked him at any point, horrible horrible type of person with nothing Everton about him in my opinion, full of shit and in my opinion insincere, lets have some grit back please, we arent ready for flash harrys\n70 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:02:35\n71 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:02:38\n72 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:03:09\n73 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:04:16\n74 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:05:11\n75 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:05:56\nLampard had to go, for poor management. Seems a great guy, gets the club and the fans, but he wasn't good enough. Not experienced enough\n76 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:06:20\nIn some ways it is like the Top flight Professional of old nearing the end of his career, playing in the Lower Divisions below the championship or old second divison and realising the dressing room was full of cheats.I have read a few autobiographies which such a experience is discribed.\nThe Modern footballer can retire today or go to Everton who have replaced the Lower Divisions for such players, with the bonus of having cheats at nearly every level in the Club.They might even be able to get a job after their playing days are done.\nThe performance which I watched after the West Ham game, was cheats in action.It was a diabolical disgrace the way those players performanced.I have friends come up to me and say it was absolutely unbelievable the dross they where producing.\n77 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:06:21\n78 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:07:03\nBielsa please. I want to see us attack once in my lifetime!\n79 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:07:10\n80 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:07:29\nBut, that aside - good managers use what they've got and improve their lot. Frank was a bloody awful manager. We seem to have a knack for recruiting awful managers and paying over the odds for mediocre players.\n81 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:08:03\n82 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:08:28\n83 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:08:51\n84 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:09:20\n85 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:09:56\n86 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:10:09\n87 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:10:31\nI read somewhere today that if Holgate is still here when the new guy arrives - that will be the eleventh manager/caretaker manager that he will have served under.\nThe lack of official news from Everton FC's site is appalling, but I suppose they haven't yet realised that Rafa had been sacked.\n88 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:11:10\n89 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:12:36\nHolgate is the gift that keeps on giving isn't here. Tom Davies has been in the squad just as long.\n90 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:12:47\n91 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:13:01\n92 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:13:11\n93 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:13:29\n94 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:13:29\n95 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:14:02\nLuckily we have not been cut adrift as there are other terrible teams. If we get the next appointment right - there is still time and still hope.\n96 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:14:38\n97 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:14:49\n98 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:16:38\n99 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:16:42\n100 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:16:45\n101 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:17:36\n102 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:18:05\n103 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:18:26\n104 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:19:11\n105 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:19:11\n106 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:20:21\nIF, by some miracle, we do stay up then we'll only be in the same position again next year, and so on. It's sad to think that my gut feeling is that the only way we may improve is by being relegated so that those up top have to either take note or get out the club otherwise these clowns aren't going anywhere.\n107 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:20:37\n108 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:21:00\n109 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:21:28\nA saviour my arse\nThe only reason to get him is if we are resigned to going down then at least our new manager in the summer won't have taken us down\n110 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:23:14\nINT. BUNKER - FUHRER'S OFFICE - APRIL 2022 (er 1944)\n\"Herr General Lampard, ve haf sold Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin is permanently out of service and gifs zero shits, Townsend, Mina, Doucoure, Patterson are permanently crocked, Davies, Gray, Gordon, Keane, Mykolenko are totally shell shocked but all iz vell because I haf been inspiring ze troops mit mein Meisterplan! I haf bought a dvarf centre forward und Feldmarschall Moshiri is now going today on an Unterseeboat to Argentina for reinforcements - he says. Unfortunately, unser trips to Vest Ham (Leningrad), Brighton (North Africa), Bournemouth (Stalingrad), und zer home games with Wolves (Kursk), Normandy (Old Trafford), und ze Ardennes (Southampton) have not brought the victories we needed.\n\"I sink we are gefucked.\n\"Zis cannot be because of mein glorious leadership, it must be you.

He knows the Premiership, got Burnley promoted and kept them up for 5 or 6 years, beating some of the top sides in that period.\nI remember people on here also, poo pooing the idea of getting Eddie Howe a few Vacancies ago, but he is doing alright at the barcodes, as is Marco Silva with Fulham. Give who ever it is a chance to fail before writing them off in The Last Chance Saloon, because that is what this is !\nBarry/Stephen, - Walid Regragui ? I'm sure I saw that on the menu in a Mongolian Restaurant once. :-)\n114 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:24:47\nNo Thanks.\n115 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:26:25\nHave you seen his record in the MLS, what makes anyone think he could turn us around?\n116 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:27:00\n117 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:27:52\n118 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:28:03\n119 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:28:03\nFuck me you couldn't make it up.\n120 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:28:06\nTHe last time a club looked this broken, this chaotic and this bankrupt - financially, organisationally, and in its performance was Leeds 2003 - they disappeared for something like 14 yrs. An absolute nightmare for them. We really are looking at something not dissimilar if our board continually fail to address the insidious cancer in this club (tho, for everyone who cares but a jot for this club knows that the cancer is them )\nI think we are going down. I would have preferred to have gone down with dignity, fighting for every point. But the lights have gone out for me. I fear it will be with ignomy and, from some, a sneering 'serves you right' and maybe, to be fair, they would be right.\n121 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:28:28\nSomeone who will plan for the Championship and sign honest fit, mobile young players as opposed to thecrocks of shite we have been employing.

Surely finishing bottom of the EPL would be a more prestigious failure for his resume.\n125 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:29:13\n1) can I borrow your parallel universe machine please?\n2) so you wouldn't take Howe, Klopp, Conte, Wenger and Sarri either (since they all REALLY got relegated)?\n126 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:29:52\n127 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:31:00\nSo I'm willing to put myself forward and take one for the team. For just £5 million, I will follow Bill's instructions to the letter, I'll blame the supporters, the previous management, Liz Truss, Donald Trump, JK Rowling, the tea lady.\nI'll get the wage bill down by selling anyone who's any good (OK, that's Jordan Pickford AAANNNNNDDD... no one else), and get Big Nev (well, Enormous Nev judging by recent photos) to act as a kind of bollard in the goal.\n128 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:31:03\n129 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:32:39\nIf he should somehow make a silk purse out of our pig's ear, the football world will hail him as a genius.\n130 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:35:43\n131 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:36:25\n132 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:37:01\nWe'd get relegated for sure, but at least we'd have some decent shortbread to nosh on.\n133 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:37:35\n134 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:37:35\nBielsa or Dyche for me. I think Dyche would have more chance of hitting the ground running and would give us a small chance of survival this season. Bielsa would be an interesting longer term proposition.\n135 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:37:42\n136 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:37:45\n137 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:38:06\nNuno Santos would be my in my second target group\nBielsa would be third\nNot sure after that really just not Dyche or hassenhutl\n138 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:39:49\nCan I be your undermanager, on condition it only takes up 5% of my time?\n139 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:40:12\nand we have no life boatt to save us. I really fear for my club that my whole family has supported since it's beginning. Kenwright, I fear will not get to cut the blue ribbon on the new stadium opening because we may be finished by then.\nVery bad times our club finds itself in.\n140 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:40:15\n141 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:40:27\nHe performed a miracle at Burnley. I'm not saying he is the best manager but surely he is what we need right now. Him or Bielsa. I know Bieksa was sacked too but right now, aren't they what we need. We are brassic\n142 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:40:33\n143 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:42:02\n144 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:43:03\nI really did believe we could be onto something with him as he, seemingly, had the full support of the fans and he'd toughened us up with the likes of Tarks and Coady.\nHe seems like a nice guy with real affection for our club. I wish him well in the future.\n145 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:44:03\nSpanish, Italian or South Americans for me. They know the game better than anyone.\n146 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:47:00\nBurnley get relegated and sell their best players but Vincent Kompany comes in and revitalizes the Club in one close season; changing the whole coaching and fitness regime and gets them playing fast aggressive football.\nBut some people say that it has to be Dyche for us as our next manager due to hope that he can keep us up.\nInstead of employing another dinosaur who will be gone in 6 months when we can't stand the miserable football we're playing why not make a progressive decision and go and get Kompany.\nThere are ٣ million reasons why he'd take the job.\n147 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:47:10\n148 Posted 23/01/2023 at 16:47:25\nIt's a joke. Firstly, they made it apparent he was done with their post match comments so why the two delay? And even now no official statement just the usual leaking to the press or perhaps it was even Frank's people doing the leaking. Who knows?

Money dictates usually where a club finishes in the league. Since Benitez it's pretty obvious the club is walking a tightrope with ffp.\nLampard should have spent whatever money we had on strikers in the summer and we probably wouldn't be in this mess.\nI don't want bielsa as this team don't have any legs. I want someone who knows the league and can motivate. Dyche is the obvious choice.\nWould Poch sign on for the rest of the season?\nTough choices but we are again at the mercy of the cowboys running the club.\nCoyb fuck the board.\n172 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:02:44\n173 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:03:55\nI think Pat was being sarcastic or truthful as by the time we appoint the new guy, there might only be ten games to go.\n174 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:04:21\n175 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:04:24\n176 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:04:44\n177 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:05:10\nEverton gives the impression of being an oligarch directed money-laundering operation \"run\" by a senile ex-Coronation Street actor where successful football is about number 37 on the list of objectives and well below \"employing average ex-players in a non-executive role with the hope of deflecting any criticism\"\n178 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:05:57\n179 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:07:10\n180 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:07:12\n181 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:07:27\nNow SACK THE WHOLE FUCKING BOARD!\n182 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:07:39\n183 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:07:39\n184 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:08:53\nGerry, thanks for explaining it!\n185 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:09:07\nWe have not been this organised for the last 30 years!\nThose decisions are not down to the managers but the board!\nWhat does that tell you all?\n186 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:09:17\nAs Phil McNulty says on the BBC Football web site. How can you expect a manager to inherit a team of players who were variously assembled by five different managers without at least giving him a racing chance to buy in others that would more satisfactorily settle into his way of playing.\nHaving said that, there was some culpability on his part (as far as we can figure) for not lining up a striker early on in this summer window just passed, to compensate for the loss of Richarlason.\nI wish him well in his next post if looks to rejoin the tortured world of management.

Dysfunctional decision making at board level will continue apace unless of course, Kenwright and Co resign or Moshiri finally does what he should have done years ago, sacks them. One swallow doesn't make a summer and one scapegoat doesn't make everything alright at Goodison Park.\nAs for Frank Lampard, we will always have our miracle. The night of the Palace victory.\n222 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:39:24\nThere's a new board game coming out soon \"Haven't A Cluedo\" based on our beloved club.\n223 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:40:19\n224 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:40:36\nIf its him its bad enough getting no info from the club nevermind a manager that cant speak English.\nFor gods sake get Dyche he'll shake them up, its our only chance to stay up.\n225 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:42:34\n226 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:43:43\n227 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:44:05\nIf anyone points to the BBC, he should say that they also announced that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction on the strength of Alastair Campbell's report, and that turned out not to be true so you can't believe anything from that source.\nHe should then announce that Moshiri has given him total executive control and that Bill Kenwright, Little Miss Dynamite and Sharpe have announced their resignation from the board.\n228 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:44:47\nIt would be really interesting to know how much of a say he actually had in transfers. Someone decided to sign McNeill, presumably for his crossing ability. Crosses meant for the not-exactly-towering Maupay and our often injured target man DCL. And further on Maupay - I don't think he is terrible, but he was infamous for missing chances at Brightonâ€¦ so why bring him to a side that barely creates anything?\nNothing seems to be very joined-up does it? Which is partly why we're here I suppose.\n229 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:44:48\nLampard, unless he is delusional, must have realized that he had lost the reigns two months ago.\nI understand that there is money involved, but still. Talking away after the West Ham game as if in total denial is really pathetic.\nPersonally, I do not think he had much impact on our situation at the end of last season. It was the fans and the players.\nSpeaking of delusional, I hope Billy the Kid and Mon Cherie move for a very quick replacement.\n230 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:47:11\nStill if they have someone lined up he will get a little more time in a transfer window than Lampard had when he was first hired,\nI hope the players have along hard look at their own performances as supposed professionals as there has been a lack of effort and skill with some of them.\nWhat a mess and yet the major culprits that caused these problems since the club was bought still remain, including my major complaint over the last couple of months,who I believe was responsible for the mess but refuses to admit to causing the problems F.Moshiri.\nBest of luck to Lampard in his future and hope if another club sign him he is not burdened with a millstone around his neck.\n231 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:47:18\nNot really, just the barcode fans making merry at our current situation\n232 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:47:31\n233 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:48:41\n234 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:49:54\nWell - you never know.\nSorry - come to my sense now - scrap that - I think sadly we do know all too well after the last three decades\n235 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:51:38\n236 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:52:20\nShould never be allowed near another managers role, the players look unfit, unmotivated, disorganised and generally didn't have clue what they were doing. SuperFrank stood there like a rabbit in the headlights as his team failed to do most of the basics required such as pass and move and he did not have a Scooby about in-game management. Used to make me laugh when his number two was whispering in his ear as though what he was telling him was something to be hidden from the opposition, he couldn't even put another forward on when we're 2-0 down.\nShould've gone before the World Cup, goodbye and good riddance Frank and all your useless coaches, I would've liked Rogers before we gave the job to FF but he would be on a hiding to nothing, we can still avoid relegation with the right man in place though I don't know who the f*** that is.\nSACK THE BOARD!\n237 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:53:43\nEvertonians aspire to the highest level but the club lacks the means creating a toxic mix and the greatest poisoned chalice in English football.\nGood luck, Fella. If it's any solace in 12 months time we'll be sacking the next guy unless bought out by an oil state.\n238 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:57:28\nObviously defensively not great, and potential for him to fall out and resign after 5 games.\nat least if we got relegated with Bielsaz there'd be the feeling that we went down fighting\nNot saying I think he should be hired, there are equal chances of him being either a success or being an absolute disaster.\nHowever, he can speak English Ray. He just chooses not to speak English to the media.\n239 Posted 23/01/2023 at 17:58:48\nWunderbra!\n240 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:00:27\n241 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:00:34\nLampard joins the procession of managers deemed not good enough, yet again a scapegoat for the appalling decisions of the last decade made by Moshiri and Kenwright.\nThat's why we are where we are. We have players who should not be in the Premier League never mind our first team. We have zero quality outside perhaps 5 or 6 players. Even in the last few seasons we have seen the back of Richarlison, James, Digne, Sigurdsson, Allan, every single one light years better than their replacements. You can't replace quality with dross and expect to survive. What did the board do? Appoint an inexperienced manager and ask him to put the jigsaw together without ever allowing him to see the picture on the box.\nIt was doomed to fail however good a man he is, however passionate he was in the fans, however much most of us wanted so much for it to work.\nThis club is teetering on the brink of total collapse due solely to the quality of leadership and culture of ownership. There is no point in having money if you aren't allowed to spend it or spend what you have badly. The disgraceful perfect storm of a club with financial backing, ruinous leadership, in a league that allows absurd transfer spends by some clubs but not others.. no matter who or how it's funded.\nI have no idea who has the balls big enough for this job, but whoever it is must know they are not playing with a full deck, that what they are told will be mostly bullshit, that they better have their own plan to fix it because they can expect this board to have another bus ready to throw him under should the fans turn against them. (the board)\nThe last 20 years have finally, inevitably, come home to roost. Our fears and warnings went not only went unheeded but were ridiculed by incompetent leadership. We have been the mushrooms under the main stand in all that time.\nPersonally I feel I have been shouting in the wind half my life with this club I love and can't let go. I am angry, saddened, upset but not at all surprised. There is an oft used expression used here that best sums up my feelings, it's the hope that gets you.\nI am ashamed of the ownership and leadership of this club, the self interest culture of what's best for me. The utter lack of a plan, a vision we can all support and believe in. The leadership who have done everything in their power to eradicate responsibility and communication with shareholders and fans, their silence is only matched by their arrogance. They live in a world where they believe everything they say and condemn perspectives outside of their circle.\nFans aren't perfect, just a reflection of society, good and bad. All WE want is a team we love to inspire us once more and a team on and off the pitch with a plan, communicated and believed in by all, understood by all. Self interest and incompetence of leadership sees another manager gone. Until change happens in the boardroom, until communication of a plan is shared, the carnage will continue.\nSomehow, we have to survive. Somehow we have to inspire players and manager to get out of this hole we are in. It's a sticking plaster where surgery is required, but right now we have to stop the bleed, save the patient, save the club.\n242 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:01:49\n243 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:05:02\nMust say Frank is a decent person who tried his best.\nOne thing should be realized that who ever takes over the managers job at Everton he is going to have a massive rebuilding job which will take as I mentioned before at least 3 years and probably involve the relegation to the\nChampionship.\n244 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:06:16\nRob, Skunk fans would need to be 80 to have any real recollection of an FA Cup victory and there's no one alive who will remember the last time this so called 'Big Club' won the League. Fantasists, all of them.\n245 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:09:52\nIf Dyche is appointed you may as well throw your season ticket in the river. He can't even talk a good game.\n246 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:10:04\n249 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:13:27\nI think I'm correct in saying that if Newcastle don't win the league in the next four seasons it will be a century since they last did so in 1926/27.\nBoth Sunderland and Sheffield Wednesday have lifted the league title since Newcastle last did, and the Mackems have won it six times compared to Newcastle's four.\n250 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:14:10\n251 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:14:27\nIf we go down we will loose a number of players who will not want to play in a lower league, so we are back to another rebuild, so never mind getting in a manager who excels in defending his own goal let us get a manager who wants to defend His goal after we have put 3 goals in the other end.\nIf we are going to go down I would rather see my club go down fighting to stay up, not defending.\nThere are to many good teams and players who are manged by good managers that will rip apart a one trick pony like Dyche.\nBattles are not won by being safe, battles are won by taking manageable risks.\ni\n252 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:16:12\nMotivator needed for players to have any chance, board must be changed.\n253 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:17:51\n254 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:19:39\n255 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:19:57\nPerhaps next time, without his hands tied with a club selling its best player and having to put up with mainly a bunch of rejects.\nEven Ancelotti one of the best managers in the world couldn't do it.\nS.O.S\n256 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:19:58\nIt seems like some are still ignorant of our current predicament, including our board. We've made this move far, far too late. There aren't enough winnable games left.\n258 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:21:36\n259 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:22:13\n260 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:25:56\nLampard has been trying hard but after 3 managerial jobs is still learning the coaching side of things.\nObviously with solid financial backing one could speculate that he could have been in a better position than he is now but that's maybe being a little complimentary.\nHe seems a nice guy and I am sure he will emerge as a successful manager down the line.\nHe just seemed a little naive at times with strategies which were costing Everton precious points at times when they looked in a good position for a win or draw.\nAny new man will need a lot of luck to turn this around although there is half a season to go.\nIt's going to be a real dogfight with some of the dross around us and we will need some big efforts like the Man.City game.\n261 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:26:08\nJust like the so called experts on here who once upon a time proclaimed that Eddie Howe was a light weight and didn't know how to organise a defence . tell that to Newcastle fans now.\n262 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:27:40\nI agree.\nUsmo. Too scared to come out and admit it.\nWhy? Getting thrown out of a high rise window. Just saying.\n263 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:29:12\n264 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:29:26\n265 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:29:44\nThe focus here is to survive in the Premier League. Forget any planning for next season. The plan has to deal with a club on a knife edge now.\nSince there is no money (apparently), there is no point in bringing in a coach who can only perform when bringing in his type of player. We need a coach who can work with what is there and bring the best out of them.\nThis sort of thinking leads inevitably to Dyche: he knows the strengths of the ex-Burnley players at least, and he built his reputation on getting the best out of the fairly average (which is our squad).\n266 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:34:39\n267 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:34:43\n268 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:35:13\nNail on the head.\n269 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:39:22\n270 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:39:35\nUnfit, no guile, no backbone, the negatives are numerous\nIf we bring in someone like Dyche we may get more defensive and solid at the back but unfortunately that is not what we need right now\nThe only way of getting away from the bottom 3 is to win games. 3 points or nothing at this stage\nIf we are going down at least lets try and put the effort in.\nRooney, Ferguson, Dyche will not get us winning\nMaybe that mad arse Bielsa might.\nHe seems to know only one way of playing\nMight he be interested in a short term deal after being out the game for a fair while\n271 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:40:07\n272 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:40:55\nSean Dyche – 6/4\nMarcelo Bielsa – 3/1\nDavid Moyes – 6/1\nNuno Espirito Santo – 10/1\nWayne Rooney – 10/1\nSam Allardyce – 12/1\nDuncan Ferguson – 12/1\nAnge Postecoglou – 12/1\nDomenico Tedesco – 12/1\nRafa Benitez – 14/1\n273 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:40:59\n274 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:41:10\nEven Arteta would struggle with our squad.\n275 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:41:45\n276 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:42:00\n277 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:43:56\n278 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:44:02\nYou're implying that things would be different with someone else?\n279 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:44:47\n280 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:45:44\n281 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:46:50\n282 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:47:29\n283 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:50:26\n284 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:50:51\n285 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:52:08\nI'm absolutely gutted, but not for Lampard, but for every single Evertonian, who deserves better. Christine's sad but very good post, is very similar to the words used by Alan Stubbs, on sky television before.\nWe all know where the â€˜problem lies', but the club is full of “nepotistic liarsâ€. People who have always been more concerned about themselves than Everton, still reign, but surely they can't have long left now\n286 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:52:10\nOdds - Odds on\n287 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:53:17\n288 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:53:37\n289 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:53:45\nLampard's biggest failing was playing with only one lone striker. The players we have need lots of chances to score, they are just not clinical. We might concede lots of goals with Bielsa and lose many games, but maybe, just maybe he can get us to win enough games to stay up.\n290 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:53:46\nJim : \" I'm hearing that you have made a decision on who the next manager will be\"\nMosh: \"It's nothing to do with me Jim, I only sign the cheques, although that's taking up less and less of my time, i've got stubs here to prove it\"\nJim \"Stubbs, you're going for Stubbs but isn't he person non Grata at Goodison?\"\nMosh: \"Ha ha he he, Bill will be having kittens, no not Alan Stubbs,\nCheque Stubs\"\nJim: \"Thanks for the clarification Farhad, so who is the manager going to be?\"\nMosh:\" Frank, Jim, Its always been Frank my number one target\"\nJim: \"The guy from Brentford Farhad?\"\nMosh: \"No Jim, have you been on the whisky again?, Frank from Chelsea, he's excited to be the Everton manager\"\nJim: \"OK Farhad, I'll speak to you again next year!\"\n291 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:54:31\nThe scene: Bill Kenwright's luxury apartment in West London. There are sleeping bags and cushions on the floor along with the remains of last night's takeaways and a couple of empty bottles of brown ale.\nBaxi, Sharp and Ingles are round the kitchen table. Baxi is updating her Linkdin profile, Sharp is wearing a gold lame dressing gown and doing a jigsaw, Ingles is pressing numbers on a calculator, then sighing, pressing clear and starting again.\nBill walks in wearing just his vest and underpants.\nBaxi: Oh Bill, can we go back to Liverpool today?\nBill: No, Baxi darling, still too dangerous. We'll hunker down here for a few more days. It's great isn't it? Like Churchill in his wartime bunker.\n(no enthusiasm from anyone else)\nSharp: It all went wrong on Saturday, didn't it boss? We lose, West Ham win, Moyesie keeps his job and we've got to sack Frank.\n(Bill's face darkens)\nBill: First, my little Scottish friend, get my bloody dressing gown off. It was a present from Billy J Kramer.\nSecond, it didn't go quite according to plan but trust in your uncle Billy, he always gets it right.\n(Baxi sniggers)\nBill: Mosh turning up unannounced wasn't a help. Looking like Dracula and with those 6 Chechen thugs in tow, no wonder our poor little lambs were so petrified and couldn't make two passes.\nBaxi: They can't anyway.\n(Sharp sniggers – Bill scowls at him and flips a couple of jigsaw pieces into place)\nBill: Finish this today, Sharpie, and I'll let you move up to 100 pieces. Now, I'll take you all out for lunch at one of my clubs and then we'll take in a show. I know where I can get some cheap tickets for a Monday afternoon.\nSharp: Haven't we got to sack Frank and find someone else?\nBill: Oh, plenty of time for that. There's 18 games left, you know, and there's always a Carlos-Victor-Marcelo Ancello-Bielzeebub-iera hanging around looking for a job if we can't get Moyesie.\nCome on, disguises on everyone.\n292 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:54:56\n293 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:57:22\nThat would be a great choice from left field and he's quite a character so he might ruffle a few feathers here.\n294 Posted 23/01/2023 at 18:57:57\n295 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:01:36\n296 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:02:55\n297 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:03:29\nit's not just about being incompetent.\nThey also have to look and act it too\n298 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:05:40\nNo Dyche - his style of football doesn't work against the modern player that play between the lines at lightening pace like Rashford and Saka.\nNo Beisla - needs to sign 3 more strikers for the bench as the team would be knackered by half time and if he doesn't have 3 world class sprinters on the bench then the open football will give other teams a free pass to score goals\nUrgent - sign 2 finishers with pace, control of the ball, make good runs and not afraid to make the runs. The right manager will be tempted with 2 excellent finishers added to the squad.\n299 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:06:12\n137\nthe esk @theesk I understand that the formal club announcement re Lampard & his colleagues departure will only be made after the completion of legal formalities (which is the correct procedure). The earlier release of news of his departure was not authorised by the club.\n300 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:09:25\nHopefully his manager short list is shorter than that plan. As for the Odds on list. What a ridiculous assortment of clowns. Rafa at 14/1? We literally just sacked him for doing what Frank has done this season plus being a wanker in general. Why in God's name does anyone think he is in the running? Allardyce we sacked years ago since when he's been relegated and retired I believe? Moyes? He he has a better squad, better board and better points than us even though he is yesterday's man with a failed relegation battle to his name. Rooney? Worst in the league at Derby. Worst in the MLS.\nI assume these fools are on here as the media realize even bigger fools are the ones making the decision.\n301 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:09:56\nWhen I think of our basket case of a club, I'm not sure the current players could cope with a man as intense as Bielsa, and it would probably end in tears by March, but and as always, it's a big fucking butâ€¦.But Imagine watching Everton playing with real intensity?\nGive us a new owner, who could take the financial hit, but then give us some fresh ideas and a proper achievable plan, and I'm already prepared for relegation, but I'd love to see some gung-ho football, and believe this might just keep Everton up. Especially if we can get in another couple of attack minded players before the transfer window closes, in 8 days time.\n302 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:10:10\n303 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:10:57\nIt needs to be a fully experienced organiser with balls of steel. Forget the so called elite managers it's not happening and may not work even if it was.\nDyche doesn't inspire the purists , dour, methodical, potatoes, mud sprouts, turnips, steak and kidney pie and soggy chippy chips â€¦ but you have to give him some credit for what he did at Burnley.\nThey boxed above their weight for many years under him in the toughest league. He has football in his blood as a lower leagues player starting out under Clough, and then a long, over performing managerial career. No silver spoons on the way . The hard earned, fully time served managerial experience is all there.\nThey all look big gambles to me, but to try to keep us in the league possibly Dyche is the best choice of those available and who would be motivated to come not just financially but with professional vigour.\nWhether he is the one to take the club forward after he keeps us up is another debate altogether , but Dyche himself will provide evidence for that one way or another through his results.\nWhoever gets it will have a very tough time, the financial situation, the board dysfunction, half the fans will be skeptical of any appointment from the current list of suspects.\nIn light of it all, if that man can keep us up it will be a heroic effort.\n304 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:11:44\nImagine the awkwardness when they review Frank's contract and realize he is due compensation. Then a press release from the club saying that he never was sacked and in fact a fan placed the head of PR in a headlock and forced him to leak this fake news.\n305 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:11:58\n306 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:12:24\nLess than 3 minutes in and Danny Higginbotham got to the conclusion. Then immediately it was noted that there is no club statement. Devastating as it gets.\n307 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:12:36\nWe are no longer a big club and must stop playing it out from the back. Tight defence, midfield that works its bollocks off and strikers who give their all.\nGot to be Dyche!!\n308 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:14:56\nWhoever it is, will need need balls of steel.\nI think it will an out of work manager - absolutely no chance of attracting the likes Thomas Frank.\nPochettino, Tuchel will politely tell Moshiri NO THANKS.\nDyce it is then !\n309 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:15:28\n310 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:18:39\n311 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:18:45\n312 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:19:00\n313 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:19:10\nA long-time, playing star who couldn't let go of the limelight. And \"Big-Name\" his way into 3 manager jobs and failed at all of them.\nAnd despite his indisputably clue-free handling of the Team, Mr. \"What a great guy.\" hung in there until the Club had to settle with him financially.\nNice.\nSo, good-bye Frank, you me-first, selfish piece of shit.\nYour playing days are long-gone and you sure can't manage a club. So, go climb mountains for 3 years or so and get \"I'm Big-Time\" out of your system. Those days are over.\n314 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:25:29\n315 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:26:52\n316 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:27:14\nNot Chocolate Snowballs either !\n317 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:28:35\nDon't matter who they bring in very unlikely they can get these players to win enough games. Six managers later these gobshites running the Club still haven't noticed it's the players who are shite.\n318 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:29:11\n319 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:31:17\nNeed a progressive manager who's innovative brave and tactically astute. Sounds easy. No has-beens or football dinosaurs for me, a Potter, Nagelsmaan, or De Zerbi type. Maybe Domenico Tedesco\n320 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:32:51\nThat's perfectly normal, but the unofficial leaking is interesting, isn't it?\n321 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:40:15\nA properly written contract would or should spell out the terms for severance, financial and non-financial. Any deviation from that can be meet with legal action if breached. Let's face it, we do this at least annually so we should be good at it by now.\nAs for the new manager, personally I'd accept our fate and find someone who can re-build from the Championship. But I think Moshiri will be desperate for one last throw of the dice to avoid his investment going up in smoke. That says to me Dyche, he is probably the only one with experience and desperate enough to do the job.\n322 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:44:26\n323 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:48:05\nhttps://www.evertonfc.com/teams/men/staff\n324 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:48:06\n325 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:50:17\n326 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:51:22\nThe main conclusion they draw is that Frank's record was so poor that he had to go, but then they mentioned that our transfers have been very poor and we have wasted money(oh I never heard that before!) but they also thought that Carlo had been the best manager of recent history(overlooking Alardyce's and Koeman's finishing around (8th?)\nSo the narrative is, Moshiri is trigger-happy and we spent too much money on poor players and sacked people unfairly.\nIt's such lazy journalism.\nNo mention of Bill Kenwright and his \"guidance\" to Moshiri, or the tentacles that Bill has stretching all over the place, nor did I hear mentioned the name of our CEO.\nThey scratched their heads wondering about just how it could have been so disfunctional but our Chairman and CEO were left out of the conversation.\nMakes you wonder!\nSo it's all Moshiri's fault and he's an idiot for wasting all that money no mention of the new stadium and how much money that might be taking away from tthe club, no mention of the Uzbeki money man who has left the country.\nWhat a programme!\n327 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:51:25\n328 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:51:27\n329 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:52:47\n330 Posted 23/01/2023 at 19:54:27\n331 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:01:18\nDon't miss that\nFrank L \" I've played in big matches, I know what it's like to be a Premier League player, I've been in tough games, I've been there, done it\"\nKinell Frank, I won't miss all that !!!!\n332 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:01:54\nThey are even going for Felicity Kendall believing that she must have been related to Howard, so has the blueprint for success! :-)\n333 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:07:13\nA comments was made by Dominic King saying that Goodison was a home of real football, that Everton are a big club, Sutton just laughed, asking when real football was last played there, another pundit (Nevin?)

Unfortunately, that ain't gonna happen in time to save us from relegation.\n335 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:11:48\nEeryone know the board is gash. Never even told the players. So, I hope everyone doesn't forget and really tries to get them out.\nHowever, thinking the solution was staying with grey Frank just cos others before got sacked is as daft a suggestion as anything Moshiri or Kenwright have come up with, for fuck's sake.\n336 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:11:51\nAt least we'd have a clue on how to attack balls in the box.\n337 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:14:33\nPerhaps they've just dissolved the first team to concentrate on the women's team and all the usual charity things?\nJust wish they would have told us...ðŸ¤”\n338 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:14:41\n339 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:16:22\nEveryone can dream that a white knight is riding in on his stallion.\nBack on planet Earth we will get what there is.\nDyche knows the Prem and knows what a dogfight is.\nWho is to say that if by some miracle we can stay up that he may just be able to grow something if we have some money to spend. He has always had a tight budget and with money he may prove he can take a team forward and away from a negative brand of football.\nEverything on this topic is conjecture.

The fansâ€¦they were holding Sharpie's panda hostage and said â€˜pull the trigger, Farhad, or this panda will never get to learn Kung Fu' andâ€¦ I ask you Jimâ€¦ what could I do?â€\nThe same pack of shifty half-arsed custodians who don't even have enough common decency to release an official statement confirming the departure of the man they hired, despite it already being common knowledge hours before.\nFor me, it will make very little difference who the new â€˜manager' is until they ditch the flawed director of football model that has done nothing for this club but gather a group of gutless goldbrickers who look about as at home on grass as Harrison Ford did high-fiving a fucking Ewok, while exhibiting all the fiduciary responsibility of Richard Pryor in a fictional mayoral race.\n353 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:39:46\nLampard will be paid well and is already loaded... but I'm sure his decision to go into management wasn't to make a few quid and get out with compensation.\nWe've pretty much ended his managerial career in just 12 months. He serves as a lesson to any manager with career ambitions â€“ don't go to Everton.\nSo who next? Pretty much anyone that will take us.\nWe can only hope that the delay in sacking and announcing was strategic... ie, because we've got an incoming manager sorted.

He love Chelsea, where the horrid oligarch pumped money in for 15 years sacking managers for fun but he has a go at us.\nI saw him play for us and half the time he was as ineffectual as any poncey winger. He wouldn't last five minutes in the current era because he was so unfit.\nRemember when the twit thought it would be a good idea to demonstrate how the combination of Baines and Pienaar worked and how to stop it? It was all over the BBC website. And it was definitely taken-up by the other coaches.\nHe might very well be a good pundit but he has no affection for our great club.\nso the narrative is...we are a basket case, it's Moshiri's fault and we deserve no sympathy.\nOh and it's nothing to do with Bill K.\n360 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:48:55\nhttps://www.evertonfc.com/news/3035655/club-statement\nSee anything you didn't know?\n361 Posted 23/01/2023 at 20:48:59\nChristine: Sutton is a nasty bellend who has always hated us, and Nevin a whining piece of nothing.

Pray to God, this has been the Final Conflict...\nBitterly difficult times for EFC, but let's hope this time around there's genuine hope on the horizon.\nAs has been said, very rarely do great footballers make good, let alone great managers.\nFranks legacy, being honest he kept us up last season, and that's about it, as in reality, the most partisan Everton support, rallied the squad, and miracle of the Palace game happened.\nBut the Board, should be accountable and Thelwall.\nSelling our best player to Spurs, and not replacing him, and buying Championship players to bolster the squad, contributed to Evertons malaise, before the season started.\nThe ex player who can't be named chipped in with good goals, dead balls, and assists, as did Hamez.\nThat creativity, Richarlisons fight and desire, and never replacing Lukaku, has also contributed to an organic decline of the EFC 1st teams, effectiveness, over the last 6 years.\nSo the very best of luck to the new manager, and my hunch is I've no idea who it will be, but they will get the full support of Evertonians.\nStaying up is possible, and it's a funny old game.\nNew manager bounce, let's see.\nUTFTs!\n367 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:06:17\n368 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:06:23\n369 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:06:34\n370 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:09:13\n371 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:12:35\nWhilst Lampard seems to have been a nice bloke, so's the Dalai Lama, but I'll be damned if he should be our manager.\nLampard has plainly not been good enough. Strategically naive, predictable and no where near a manager that could have been thought of as classy.\nThe clear worry now is who will follow him, and should we trust our board to appoint someone who is at least reasonable?\nI'm horrified by some of the suggestions and likely candidates.\n1. Rooney. Untested, a poor thinker and no doubt, poorer readerer and writerer. Might be good at colouring in though.\n2. Dour Davey. He'd bring his knife back to the gunfight. Close to being proven equally dreadful with West Ham. Why on earth would we contemplate him again? How on earth could we Evertonians be so naive.\n3. Mr Dyche. He's a maybe for me, but not too certain about his calibre. He got close to taking Burnley down, and we could easily see Keane being central to his plans. Good for a foot up the arse of the players perhaps, but not sure.\n4. Maurizio Sarri. Maybe too, but didn't last at Chelsea (who does!) and very uncertain of what he would have to offer.\n5. Big Dunc. A admired and passionate man and Evertonian, but too little experience for our present position. This shouldn't be an option we consider.\n6. Bielsa? Of the names mentioned, perhaps my most preferred, as I believe he'd clear out plenty of very dead wood - most of our squad - and instil some passion and desire. He would also likely not take crap from Bill.\n7. Pochetino? He might be a decent bet, but our financial position might hinder what he needs.\nFundamentally I'd like to see the removal of Kenwright. Had enough.\nLet's hope we get a manager who can save us. We bloody well need saving right now.\n372 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:13:13\nNot as challenging as the last 7 years under Moshiriâ€¦â€¦Endless misery.\n373 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:14:47\nNoooooooooooo.\nPlease.

McNeil, Maupay, Ali - amazing waste of money.\nPlease please bring someone in that has more than 5 minutes of management experience and isn't signed because he was a former player.\nNOT Moyes.\nNOT Martinez\n382 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:25:04\n383 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:27:49\n384 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:30:10\n385 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:31:05\nS.Dyche joined Burnley 2012. Promoted from Championship to Premier in 2013/14 season. Relegated back down to the Championship in 2014/15 season. Promoted back to the Premiership in 2015/16 season. Finished 16th in the 2016/17. season 7th in the 2017/18th season the following seasons they finished 15th, 10th, and 17th and they were in 18th place when he left in the 2021/22 season.\nRemember this was a manager who over the years brought in the type of players he wanted to play his style of play, before wanting him at Everton, 2 of his ex players are in the defense and the goals against speak for them.\n386 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:36:50\nNot a hint of vitriol in it. Spoke my words calm, clear-thinking, AND accurate.\nI said not one word against him in here while he was our manager. Had plenty of words to myself about him, but spoke none because he was managing my Club and one has to hope for the best. He was the worst, but hung on until the Club had to force him out, and pay him out.\n\"despite the shit hand he was dealt. . . . \"\nYou're among a number who've voiced that over his tenure. When he signed, Frank KNEW it was shit hand being dealt him by a years-long dysfunctional Club operation. Yet, he gets a pass on that?\n387 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:38:24\nThis simmering civil war is about to explode and it looks like the thespian and his sidekick could be the losers. Praying for a miracle.\n388 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:41:06\nSurely Moshiri would be in the grey corner since it's not his decision.\n389 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:41:55\n390 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:44:28\n391 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:47:09\n392 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:47:42\nYou have two managers that are polar opposites in footballing philosophy, and Bielsa? do me a favour, Speaking of polar opposites, I could not think of a manager less suited to this squad of players, In addition, when he got found out, Leeds got bounced around every ground, including ours and only narrowly avoided relegation.\nAs for who will replace Lampard? No idea and even more worrying, don't really care. Give it to Deli Alli, he's hung up his boots, or the lollipop man from St Saviours, he'll give the kids a pathway. One thing's for sure, this board will fuck up the appointment.\n393 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:50:03\n394 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:59:46\n395 Posted 23/01/2023 at 21:59:46\n396 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:01:17\nBoards going nowhere until stadium is built and forehead moshiri sells up !\nGive dyche a go he's not my favourite. If it was end of season I'd say bielsa, but think dyche would get a quicker reaction from the bunch of dossers we have.\n397 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:11:42\n398 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:29:11\nSimon Grayson, the Van Gogh impersonator is available.\n399 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:34:50\n400 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:39:07\nLet's be realistic here, the Managers are NOT the main problem, they will come and go, and get blamed like the Fans and players to a degree, for failure. Most of us long standing Evertonians know where the real problem lies, and will most likely remain until we absolutely jettison the Chairman. It doesn't take a 'Sherlock Holmes' to fathom out that all of Everton's problems have happened, or declined even further, on his watch !\n401 Posted 23/01/2023 at 22:39:16\n402 Posted 23/01/2023 at 23:02:09\n403 Posted 23/01/2023 at 23:08:20\nPlus, the old adage, being a great player does not guarantee (very rarely) being a Great Manager !\n404 Posted 23/01/2023 at 23:09:08\n405 Posted 23/01/2023 at 23:10:45\nThe vitriol being poured onto potential managers is unbelievable.\nAnyone reading this site wouldn't touch us with a bargepole.\n406 Posted 23/01/2023 at 23:16:16\nMeanwhile the likes of Pochetino will laugh at the thought of coming into a circus like ours. Our squad alone would put off any manager with brains.\nWe are a basket case of a club. Imagine allowing the real culprits of our downfall to be still picking the next manager. We deserve what we get.\nSack the board Moshiri and then sell up.\n407 Posted 23/01/2023 at 23:21:31\n408 Posted 23/01/2023 at 23:47:55\n409 Posted 23/01/2023 at 23:51:13\nSome of the top names being mentioned are pure fantasy. Also there is little chance of a promising manager like Kompany risking his reputation at this stage of the season when he will probably take his club back to the Premier League. In any event we don't have the money to prise anybody away from their current job.\n410 Posted 23/01/2023 at 23:57:53\nI'd also love to see a manager push hard to maximise the talents of the current squad. There's a lot of players playing poorly due to the system employed by Lamps. Bielsa would set them free\nPlus watching Everton could be fun again!\n411 Posted 24/01/2023 at 00:04:47\nHopefully you get the message ðŸ™„ðŸ˜¡\n412 Posted 23/01/2023 at 00:06:05\nThat said we have been dire for most of this season and as far as I can tell there have been almost no changes to tactics or the starting eleven even when changes were possible.\nWhoever is responsible for letting us start the season without a new striker (Maupay doesn't count) is to blame for our current malaise.\nNot having a forward has sapped confidence game on game and it's been painful to see it happening.\nI'll get behind any new manager but really can't understand these calls for ex-players with little or no experience.\n413 Posted 24/01/2023 at 00:11:03\n414 Posted 23/01/2023 at 00:14:33\n415 Posted 24/01/2023 at 00:20:06\nBodÃ¸, a club with virtually no money has made it good the last 5 years or so. They do it very simple. They say they are going to play 433. So the manager coming in has to adjust.\nIt is then also much easier to buy players. You see what is lacking and in what positions. Then we do not have to end up with 3 number 10s, and a place in no mans land as it is right now.\n416 Posted 24/01/2023 at 00:46:33\n417 Posted 24/01/2023 at 01:22:05\nI've previously voiced an opinion in that I'd like Dyche to come in (I'll expand now) with an 18 month contract, in three parts.\nFirstly, a 6 month break clause if we get relegated.\nSecondly, the contract would state that they have to achieve 15th (EPL) or better by 15.12.23, or again there would be a contract break.\nThirdly, if they keep us up by the end of the 23/24 season, we could i) Extend their contract depending on various set targets, or ii) Pay a 20% bonus (for example) and let them walk.\nAdditionally, pay them on a tiered structure, I.e. 1-6 months on X, 7-12 months on X+30%, 13-18 months X+60% and bonus for EPL survival.\nAs for the new appointment; I'd forget any manager in situ currently, or any high profile manager, and take off those blue tinted glasses. The only manager we will attract is one that is unemployed. If an employed manager does come, it's for the money and not the possible status. Plus whoever comes, cannot be a managerial neophyte, they will need experience and nous.\nIn fact regards the above, if you'd like to replace Dyche with your preferred manager of choice, just apply the same rules/contract.\nThe one manager being mentioned, and is a bookies favourite, that I do not want is Bielsa. Not that I have anything against him, his system, his discipline or his methods. It is purely the fact, that we don't have 15, durable outfield players that are athletic enough currently.\nHence his system and methods would appear 'foolish'(?) applied to this squad, if he were appointed; even if they all were to become 'sport-induced' asthmatics like the RS were/are?\nThere is no way in hell, imho, that with 4.5 months and 18 games to go, that Bielsa could or would work. QED just look at FF and the current fitness of the players.\nIf, and it is a HUGE IF the board or owner (and his owners, Kia and Uncle Alisher) actually 'luck out' and get the choice right, there are enough games to survive.\nMy last point is, I'm fed up with people saying we play boring football, the football is poor, we're clueless, we have a poor squad etc etc etc. Forget all that, we are where we are, I couldn't careless if we played 8-0-2 hoof-ball IF WE GET POINTS.\nDo we/you really want exciting, attacking football, even if we go down!\nReally?\nIf we go down, this club will implode financially, and collapse quicker than a house of cards.\nI demand from this club, our club, EPL survival, at all costs!\nGoing forward, this club is going to need a new executive board, a new scouting system, A STRATEGY, A VISION, and a new 'Winning' culture, before we even think about such niceties as tiki-taki or such like. (Or even just playing pass and go triangles!)\n'nuff said?\nPark BMD for a year or two, relieve the financials, and get the club sorted out! What is the point of a new shiny garage, if you haven't got a car to put in it?\n418 Posted 24/01/2023 at 01:27:37\n+++++++++++++++\nMarcelo Bielsa\nPros:\n- Every game would finish with Ice Hockey scores (4-3, 5-2...fancy that!)\n- Defenders from opposing teams would have BOTH Nightmares AND Insomnia after being pressed by us...\n- A lot of buckets are needed at Finch Farm because Senor Bielsa's famed \"MurderBall\" training regimen would have the team puking up so much that they won't fancy getting drunk\n- A Coaching Legend with unrivalled Tactical Acumen: who else is listed as someone whom Pep Guardiola looks up to as a coach?\n- A Top Class person: Leeds have a street named after him and my Leeds mates are still mad with the Club Owners one year after his dismissal\nCons:\n- Stubborn to a degree: he will only play his style and would not adapt to anything else that might be pragmatic enough to salvage a game (look at his last 10 games with Leeds when his injured squad could not played his demanding style on the field)\n- Drill Sergeant: as above, \"MurderBall\" everyday at Finch Farm might send our entire First Team to Alder Hey Children's Hospital because they would be so banged up that they wouldn't be able to do anything but to spend time helping with the rehab of the children there\n- Senor Bielsa would need full Personnel Power and getting him in would be a Deja Vu to the Benitez-Brands Power Struggle (how did we come out of it?) and another Director of Football in Thelwell would be heavily compromised: at best, Thelwell would be demoted into a de-facto \"Head of Youth Development\" that encompasses only anything from U21 down (IMHO, the changes & structures that Thelwell has laid down to date have begun showing promises) and Bielsa is a \"Control Freak\" that Thelwell would have no autonomy to do his job properly; at worst, Thelwell would leave as soon as a better opportunity elsewhere is available and all he has done with our Youth Setup would then be gone in a blink of an eye\n++++++++++++++++\nWayne Rooney\nPros:\n- He got his Derby Team of mostly U21 players going through the wall for him, despite daily turmoil (he actually paid his players' wages for 2 weeks out of his own pocket)\n- He kept Derby in the Relegation Fight a lot longer than the entire country would reckon (they were relegated only after the 40th game of a 46 games season)\n- He showed a willingness to put aside the ideal playing style he strives and play a pragmatic style for survival\n- Scouser Heritage\nCons:\n- He hasn't shown being tactical astute enough for Premier League level\n- He might not have the appetite for another relegation fight, having gone through a doomed campaign with Derby that has lost him more hair than he ever had\n++++++++++++++++\nLeighton Baines\nIn American Football terms, it's time to throw a \"Hail Mary\": name Leighton as Interim Manager till the end of the season.\nFor what we know of Leighton's down-to-earth personality, he might not even accept the post should he be offerred the role. But should he choose to accept, he will bring the following benefits:\n1) Other than Seamus, he is the last link to the Moyes regime that brought us the stability, structure, discipline and relatively consistent success. He knows what it takes to forge a closely knitted team spirit and how to demand the best out of players in a quiet, measured yet assertive way.\n2) He is technically astute, which has been highlighted a number of times by Don Carlo & his coaching team.\n3) Nobody at the club played for more managers (8 in total, FFS!) than he did (Moyes, Bobby Brown Shoes, Koeman, Rhino, Fat Sam, Marco Silva, Big Dunc & Don Carlo), which would give him a unique Alchemist perspective on how to mold the team into a Frankenstein. Nobody knows better than him, in terms of the individual SWOT for the majority of the squad.\n4) Some of my fellow Evertonians mentioned the need to bring in a tough disciplinarian who can bring constant earful to the players. Like Leonardo DiCaprio said in the movie Inception: \"Positive emotions trump negative emotions every time. We all yearn for reconciliations. Catharsis.\" We rarely see Leighton losing his cool and erupting like a Volcano (even during his voice-out that turned Bobby Brown Shoes against him wrongfully) and his cool composure is needed for a team of misfits to gain back the confidence.\n5) Some of the youngsters who are on the fringes of First Team have already played for him, which would make their eventual transition into the First Team even easier. He might be even daring enough to play some of those youngsters for a change.\n6) Going with Leighton, what else do we have to lose?\n419 Posted 23/01/2023 at 02:25:09\nA good manager could have made the sum of this team greater than it's parts because we have some pretty good parts but Moshiri listened to the supporters,\nI hope I never hear another word from anyone who wanted Lampard as manager.

As for your superior knowledge from your “studyingâ€ what does that entail exactly? As to your wish never to hear from anyone again who supported Frank and that they should “shut the hell up.â€ Tough luck on that score sunshine as most fans supported him either directly or due to lack of alternatives. While as an American “you chose Everton years ago” the club and the fans have been around a lot longer than your fleeting interest and May I suggest you take your own advice shut the hell up and arbitrarily select some other random sports team from some other random country to “study.â€ By the way how many times have you been to Goodison Park?\n424 Posted 24/01/2023 at 03:30:13\nI have no idea where we turn now from a manager standpoint, but assuming we show some sort of bounce in the coming 4-6 weeks, my greatest hope is that Everton Football Club's fans — us! — somehow again shows just how classy and passionate and determined we are that we again lift this squad of underachieving bang average players onto our shoulders and do the unthinkable: save us from relegation two years in a row. I cannot fathom we'll wallow in despair, no matter how bleak things look, not until we're mathematically eliminated from staying in the premier league.\n425 Posted 24/01/2023 at 03:33:19\nGood to see you back mate another proper American Evertonian. Hope the family are doing well.\n426 Posted 24/01/2023 at 03:45:12\nThe bottom 7 teams who have won 4 out of the last 35 league games they have played. We need to hire a manager who can drag this squad of players above 3 of those teams and avoid relegation.\nWho should take over as manager? I have no clue.\nThere are actually some good managers out there who are immediately available - Pocchettino, Tuchel, Marcelino, Tedesco, Luis Enrique, Villa-Boas,\nDyche might be the man to save us, but less likely to take us forward. His last season with Burnley was a disaster (4 wins from 35 league games), but he would simplify our gameplan in a way this squad might be able to handle. He did have run-ins with the new Burnley owners though, and dealing with this board might test his patience.\n427 Posted 24/01/2023 at 03:48:29\nThat post wasn't even worth reading once, never mind three times.\n428 Posted 24/01/2023 at 03:58:23\n429 Posted 24/01/2023 at 04:00:54\nI will add that I'm sticking by my prediction that we'll survive by being less shit than Southampton, Bournemouth and Forest. Somehow, some way.\n430 Posted 24/01/2023 at 04:04:01\nLet's hope so and we can have another pre season mini ToffeeWeb get together with Inchy and co In Minneapolis\n431 Posted 24/01/2023 at 04:04:40\nAfter him, somebody who can organize and is tactically aware such as Pocchetino but again we wouldn't appear attractive to him in our present position.\nCan't see any reason why Postecoglou would leave Celtic until they are officially crowned Champions or with them being in the Champions League because of it but he did leave the Australian national team when they had just qualified for the World Cup and his first job at Brisbane showed he is not a man to be messed with as some former Premier League players didn't see why they had to train and his response was that in that case he didn't see why they should play or be payed. And he has been a winner in Oz, Japan and Scotland as well as with the Socceroos.\nBut I'm sorry, I'd be very disappointed if the best we can do is Sean Dyche and all of which just sums up to where this Board has led our great club. I have no confidence in them getting it right the 7th(?) time around despite, as always, hoping that whoever is appointed does succeed.\n432 Posted 24/01/2023 at 04:10:35\n\"I am an American who years ago picked Everton to support for reasons I will not disclose now.\"\nI'm sorry, are we now supposed to beg and plead for you to share this incredibly crucial information? Give me a break.\nAlso, I'm glad you deduced the board has issues (several whole years ago!). We're lucky to have Nostradamus posting on here.\nAdd me to the list of fellow Americans embarrassed by this post.\n433 Posted 24/01/2023 at 04:11:52\nI'll admit when I saw Michaels's first post before the two repetitions, I found myself thinking of Begby from Trainspotting and “Who the fuck are you?â€\nJust bizarre to get some pompous nobody coming on here nullifying fans' voices. Even Rafa, who I didn't want, I supported because he was the Everton manager and I'm an Everton fan â€“ ergo, if he does well, Everton do well.\nBut I guess the bedsit brigade with their tin foil hats would rather see the whole club go up in flames so they can say, “I told you so!â€\n434 Posted 24/01/2023 at 04:18:48\nI know, mate â€“ the suspense is killing me as to why Michael supported Everton.\nWas he put in witness protection after Heysel and felt bad about the Euro ban?\nDid Inchy give him an overly generous tip as a waiter at Waffle House?\nIs he color blind and can only see blue?\nThe drama is killing me I'm so fascinated to learn his story that I'm willing to tell everyone else to shut the hell up just so I can learn from his studies.\n435 Posted 24/01/2023 at 04:22:57\nWhile I disagree with most of what Michael has written, he does have a point about all those wanting Frank 12 months ago, recently calling for the guy to be fired, and blaming the board for hiring him.\nI would also question how many times your fore mentioned “intelligentâ€ USA blues posters have been to Goodison, or even to watched them play in the USA.\nThis is a time to unite, not divide.\n436 Posted 24/01/2023 at 04:41:03\nOnly on this basis do I think that they will be looking properly and ignoring calls for Ferguson, Rooney, Dyche etc.\nThis is their last chance saloon so they know they have to get it right and by that I mean a manager of good standing and substance which ticks all of the boxes.\nIs there a good manager out there willing to put his name on the line in our cause? I can only think of one and that may upset a few of our Celtic mates.\n437 Posted 24/01/2023 at 04:45:30\nI wasn't trying to have a go at US fans for not going to Goodison as I know Jonathan personally and he's a legit fan and I watched Everton in America with him while Jamie went to Baltimore, while Mike has been to Goodison. What I object to is this bloke telling us that anyone who supported Frank should shut the hell up and never be heard of again whilst trying to create some mystery as to his undisclosed reasons for supporting the club. This is a forum for fans so whilst we might disagree his statement that anyone who supported Frank should never speak again is absurd and offensive. Since he doesn't even state his reason for supporting the club and seeks attention by shrouding it in mystery, whilst telling the majority of the fan base they're not entitled to talk, I think it's reasonable to question his credentials to tell fans what they can and can't do.\n438 Posted 24/01/2023 at 05:03:51\nThey won't be a young manager with ambitions for a top level career. They'd have to be mad to come here. That's the 'Frank' category. I think he fell in love with the idea of restoring this great club and giving this set of fans something to unite behind. No-one will be so naive again now he's shown the pitfalls.\nThey won't be a manager with a proven record of any kind of success. Again, why Everton? At best it will take many years to turn this club around. The very best they can hope for is long term pain and suffering. I think they'll say no thankyou to any offer.\nThe only type I can see are the 'merry go round' types. I assume they have a big mortgage, many privately educated kids from a string of ex wives, and a current young girlfriend who likes shiny objects. They'll come because we'll pay well.\nIt's not exactly stirring stuff but I don't see anything but an uninspiring old school manager. And maybe that's enough. Football clubs shouldn't be this dependent on a good first team coach to bail out the entire organisation. Just get someone who can get the basics right at coaching level.\nIt can only be a 6 month hire. Then the next hire can be tailored for the job at hand from June 2023 onwards. By then we might be a different club... maybe even under different stewardship.\n439 Posted 24/01/2023 at 05:43:39\nErnie, frightening but true. This next appointment will made by the same person(s) who have completely screwed this club from top to bottom.\n440 Posted 24/01/2023 at 06:29:12\nI found ToffeeWeb sometime in the late '90s and have been reading it ever since. Not sure I've ever posted but love reading all the comments â€“ it's kept me going throughout the years including 15 years working in China.\nNot sure what inspired me to post today, perhaps the imminent sense of doom this season seems to have about it. Anyways, Frank had to go â€“ it was obvious to most of us. Absolutely no idea who would be a good fit to replace him given the state of things behind the scenes.\nI tend to think a short-term 6 month appointment to some hard bastard to keep us in the Premier League regardless of the style of footy is probably the way. No way should Rooney be considered, especially after what's just happened with Lampard.\nI don't have much faith in Moshiri and co making the right choice but we gotta hope for the best!\n441 Posted 24/01/2023 at 06:32:13\nLet's line up the next poor soul aiming for the managerial waste bag whilst the real cause of the problem sits smiling, crying sometimes, and brimming with self content in the Main Stand.\nMeanwhile, we sit and stand in despair.\nI was cautious about the appointment of Lampard and was never convinced. I watch enough of Everton to have seen his tactical limitations. The players looked confused a lot of the time.\nI'll be honest, towards the end of the season and through most of this one, I didn't care or haven't cared who was in the dugout. My energy was on the team and almost on the pitch if I could have been.\nRight now I just want those players to take control and turn this around. In a rudderless ship, they need to take personal responsibility and stop feeling sorry for themselves. Leaders to step up to the mark in the absence of leadership around them.\nWe've sacked another manager. We'll hire another one. Repeat cycle.\nLike many, even me, the big dreamer and optimist; I'm so angry with my club right now.\nBut like us all, I'll there next time out.\n442 Posted 24/01/2023 at 06:40:57\nA very succinct article in the Guardian today that acknowledges Franks failings but clearly identifies where the real problems lie, that still need fixing for anything to change.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/23/sacking-lampard-was-the-right-decision-but-evertons-woes-don't-end-there\n443 Posted 24/01/2023 at 06:59:40\nEasy and obvious targets for supporters and the press.\nBut it doesn't hide the real cause. Those who are failing hide behind a manager in an act of self preservation because they can.\nMaybe they won't be able to for much longer now that the nationals are onto them.\n444 Posted 24/01/2023 at 07:13:40\nSo, who should Mr Moshiri have hired after getting rid of that fat Spanish guy? I do recall there was pretty strong backing from our fanbase for Mr Lampard to get the job, not 100% by any means, but a sizeable proportion of the fans. Mr Moshiri listened to the fans. So does that mean the fans have to accept some responsibility as well? Hardly, fans aren't in a position to take any responsibility. So wise words from the fanbase about managerial issues then and now are apparently just for entertainment value.\nWe are now hunting for another manager and ToffeeWeb has many wise suggestions. Personally I haven't a clue who would be a wise choice. Mr Moshiri has a history with Everton of apparently choosing the wrong one â€¦â€¦ is it seven times now? But he is the majority shareholder and like in any company, the majority shareholder will decide the big issues and who sits on his board of Directors. If he decides to sell up, let's hope, will a new owner and new board make these players pass the ball any better, shoot any straighter. I wish I wish.\nPersonally I feel a bit sorry for Mr Lampard who is an honest, open man, unlike many of the foreign manager crowd who now dominate what is laughably called the ENGLISH Premier League. We will have to wait and see whether firing Mr Lampard and getting someone else in, works out for us. Obviously we hope so, but doubt is eating at my insides.\n445 Posted 24/01/2023 at 07:35:51\nMoshiri will want someone glamorous.\nKenwright will want someone on his speedial.\nThelwell will want neither, and will want someone who will dovetail with him as DoF.\nUsmanov vetoing all of he above and forcing Moshiri's decisions.\nThere will be disagreement, falling out, dither and inaction. Followed by a frustrated Moshiri making another mistake.\nThis has to stop. There has to be clarity of direction and confidence in decision making.\nMoshiri and Kenwright need to get out of the way and give Kevin Thelwell the final say. If there's any chance of a coherent strategy it has to be built from the footballing side has to be built on a teamwork basis.\nWe have to stop the club fighting itself from within. We need to move forward on a clearer path.\nMoshiri has limited football acumen , Kenwright has failed to deliver over many years, is the past and now needs to step away.\nLet go. Give the DoF the reigns, the responsibility to appoint who he sees fit and see how he gets on.\n446 Posted 24/01/2023 at 07:38:04\nRight now, I don't care who the next lamb to the slaughter is as long as they're not talking to Allardyce. Someone please tell me they are not.\nI just want the team to pick themselves up, play with confidence and get points on the board. I'll be there with them regardless of Billy Smarts' circus going on behind them. I always will be.\nAs I have repeatedly said, I never thought Frank was cut out for management and I was concerned when we appointed him. But I don't have any ill feeling towards him. I actually feel for him as he really seemed to buy into the club.\nUnlike idiots like me who have never known any different since I can remember, the poor man was tricked by those above him and, if I can be slightly critical, failed by the limits of his coaching abilities.\nI don't know where Frank goes now. Punditry? Just go and enjoy time with the family? Great player, but I don't see a great coach in him. I wish him well. He tried and done his best. It just wasn't good enough.\nBut not as bad as those above him.\n447 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:03:44\n448 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:06:19\nI think the problems stemmed from those recruiting players, including a DOF, a Chairman and owner. But exactly what say in the matter did the manager actually have? Did Lampard really give the nod to Deli Ali, Maupay or McNeil?\nThe questions obviously go back much further, Brands and his famous outburst was obviously made because he was carrying the can for the purchases made, not with his blessing.\nWalsh and Koeman started the current downward spiral, but the board were kids in a sweet shop burning someone else's money with abandon, like a no limit credit card that was someone else's. The lack of financial management was appalling. For that alone the chairman and board should have been sacked..\nThe double hit finally came after the multitude of managers who failed to manage the previous set of purchases got the sack. With each new manager the issue snowballed both on and off the pitch, funds dried up, and like dejavu, we started selling the assets, the better players, compounding the problems for each subsequent manager. Until Frank.\nA good man, he actually loved being here, but he was saddled with players who aren't good enough and no adequate replacements for those sold. ( Noone has asked the question on just how the club ignored the requirements of profit and sustainability that has resulted in the club being unable to replace ill-fitting players that has created the perfect storm that has truly stuffed up this club. Who is accountable for that?)\nLampard wasn't up to the task, given our situation, it's going to be difficult to find a manager who can get the current squad into some sort of effective unit.\nBecause we are propping up the division, he rightly lost his job. But the primary reasons for his failure are not just the managers ability, but the decisions to buy and sell made over the last seven years.\nResponsibility for failure and where we are today is therefore the combination of incompetence of a board, the role of DoF and the ability of a manager to have a say in who is bought and sold..\nTraditionally it was the domain of the manager because he carries the can, but in Evertons case of continual managerial merry go round, one has to surmised the manager has little say in the matter.\nThe exception was Ancelotti who brought in players because of his reputation, players we would never have got otherwise. Even he, in the end, wanted out. For good reason.\nToday the manager has gone, scapegoat yes, to some degree it is, but he, like others before him, could not get a team together to do enough.\nBut around this, the utter shameful manipulation of the media by the board has, at long last, been laid bare. There is no future for such a board. It's irreparable.\nMoshiri has 3 options.\n1. Replace the board with competent people.\n2. Sell the club.\n3. Do nothing and risk everything.\nThe end game is coming, and it's not on the pitch.\n449 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:09:51\nHe also seems to have the sympathy of many Evertonians and is walking away with a relatively unscathed reputation despite being shockingly bad at his job.\nLet's hire someone who is an actual manager not a famous name.\n450 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:14:28\nBang on the money. The main criticism I hear of this site is that the overwhelming majority of posts are from the same group of people. Yes I'm guilty too. But when you see a regular poster trying to flexing muscles he simply doesnt have in order to shout down a lesser known voice. You get a clear understanding as to why that is.\nThe guys is told to go and find some \"other random sports team, from some other random country\"\nMicheal kinda oversteps the mark as many of us do on here. He says he doesnt want to hear from Lampard supporters. A bit like saying \"I don't want to hear from Kenwright, Moshiri, Sharp, DBB supporters\" - Althought those posts usually carry far more anger. I've even heard there is a grumpy arl bastard on here who doesnt want to hear from Carlo fans.\n\"An attention seeking, pompous nobody, living in a bedsit, who's years of support amount to no more than a \"fleeting \"interest\"...Thats some profile to build from a single post.\nI cant help imagining the Brian Ferry song - \"I'm in with the in crowd\" was blasting through the head phones as that was being typed out.\nI would imagine that any infrequent or new poster thinking of diving into the TW pool would read that, turn around and put his kit back on\n\"BTW how many times have you been to Goodison ?\"...Dear me\n451 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:15:54\n452 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:28:34\nDyche would come in, try and get things going, but would be met by a group of players, who haven't got much heart or will, right now.\nBielsa, would just fucking kill them.\nThe club is full of nepotistic poison, and whilst this continues, most players will do what most footballers do. They will pretend to be working hard, and blame somebody else, and if you wan to blame somebody else, just get yourself to Everton, because it's rotten to the absolute core, and full of self-preservationists.\n453 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:30:13\nI'm not sure what you mean.\nThese managers were all being paid in excess of 5m. Are you saying they all meekly accepted that they would have to play players they didnt want ? Have their own plans hindered ? That they agreed to thIs?\nWe've been managed by some very outspoken people, why do you think none of them has spoken out about this practice ? Even after they left\nWere they 100% compliant ? Did they not speak out because the hand that was feeding them was feeding them better than any other hand before and after their stint at this club ?\nI feel there was a touch of the Graeme Sharps in all of them. They took the money and shut up\n454 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:38:39\n455 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:40:18\nOver the years I have had some ding done battles with posters, some still here, some deserted or gone. But I have always tried to argue or accept points without getting personal ( really difficult over the years when our leader was seen as a saviour) so abuse has never been my thing.\nI have been accused of arrogance but I tried often to speak from personal experience, knowledge and a perspective analysis of how I saw things. In short, an opinion.\nSocial media oversteps the mark because of perceived anonimity of the poster who oft says things they would never dare on a face to face meet. So it's respect, even when you disagree, it doesn't need to get personal. Together we learn more, together we can at least be heard.\n456 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:46:53\nVultures circling over the carcass that is Everton. I have been supporting this club for 60 years,never have I felt this bad about the future.If the phoenix is to rise the club needs a thorough clear out from top to bottom.How do we start this process ? Answers please, I'm at a loss. R.I.P. EFC., NSNO yeah ok.\n457 Posted 24/01/2023 at 08:49:06\nI'm sure there are some really good people behind the scenes at the club but unfortunately that's where they are - behind the scenes. The public face of the club from top to bottom is just a mockery.\nI personally have no idea who will actually end up as our manager and can only speculate as to who could and would want to do the job, but in times like this - and we have had 12 or13 such instances in the last 10 years - I do wonder who the players, when discussing the situation among themselves, think they might see doing a genuinely decent job.\nAre they allowed an opinion?\n458 Posted 24/01/2023 at 09:00:09\n459 Posted 24/01/2023 at 09:04:55\nNothing hypocritical in my post. I even refer to may self as a guilty party and if you hadnt guessed. I am also the grumpy arl bastard.\nDanny is a regular poster and as with most of the regular posters we kind of know each others views on most things. He as accustomed himself to the lay of the TW land. He gives as good as he gets. He is clearly not as offended as you as he is keen to meet up for a bevy..There is no way on this earth anybody would stop Danny airing his views.\nThere is a very real difference to putting down a point with somebody you regularly debate with and hammering not just the views, but the personality of somebody you dont know..That post may as well have said \"We dont hold with your sort around here\"\nAs I said. Micheal overstepped the mark and like I also said.I`ve doen it myself. I have all but lost the will to argue with Carlo supporters...Almost. I think you have overstepped the mark too. The difference being. I recognise it\nIf you think that response will entice fresh ideas from people who may have a lot to offer debate on here. I dont have anything to say that`ll change your mind\n460 Posted 24/01/2023 at 09:23:39\n461 Posted 24/01/2023 at 09:31:59\n462 Posted 24/01/2023 at 10:17:37\nI think for the first time ever I don't have an opinion on who we should or could get, and because of where we are I would imagine the list of possible candidates will be very small. Listening to all the different outlets it could be Bielsa, Dyche, Rooney with Ferguson, and also a couple of left field choices. Again we have sacked a manager without having the next manager lined up. I read the other week that the Brighton owner Tony Bloom said that they were aware last year that a couple of the big clubs wanted Potter, so they started their search for a new manager last season.\nThey wanted someone who had the same philosophy as Potter so there would be a seamless change. So when they gave Chelsea permission to speak to Potter they had already had talks with De Zerbi, so he was installed very quickly after Potter left. Brighton are still playing the same way still very comfortably placed in the Premier League.\nTheir scouting system is second to non both for players and managers, so maybe the mantra for all Premier league clubs should be.\nWhat would Brighton do in this position.\n463 Posted 24/01/2023 at 10:24:12\nI firstly meant to respond to Christine's fine post. But I have little else to add as your 3 point ending summary captures it Christine. Moshiri has to decide where he wants to take this ship.\nWe all come on here to voice opinion. Sometimes we go over the top, especially in emotive moments. We are all guilty, me included. It would be the same in a pub where you fallout with and call your best mate and fellow Evertonian a dickhead but then head home together.\nDarren, we'll have that drink at some point. You can nark at me and I'll give you a man hug.\nMe, my brother and son once had a heated debate over Everton in a Gelsenkirchen hotel bar after a Schalke match a couple of seasons back. As I've said before and my more sensible brother said at the time, only Evertonians can argue amongst each other about the one thing they love.\nI'm keeping a keen eye on Kompany but Everton right now would be the absolute wrong choice for him.\nWe are an Everton community. Those of us that discuss, argue, fall out on here and meet at the match know and understand that. We're all big boys and girls who want the same thing.\nIn response to why Everton? I have no explanation as I have never known different since I can remember. Honestly, my first memory in life was stood outside my Grandfather's house on Arkles Lane in my very first Everton kit next to my cousin in his Liverpool one. He's now a Chelsea supporter of many years. I still have the photo, which I like to remind him of.\nI got asked last night by Mrs Danny who I loved the most. It's been a reoccurring question over the years. Always a tricky one. I used to say it's just different. These days I just stay quiet.\nI can't answer that one. It's just different.\n464 Posted 24/01/2023 at 10:29:36\nAs T.S. Eliot wrote, “to be cured, your sickness must grow worseâ€.\n467 Posted 24/01/2023 at 10:44:00\n468 Posted 24/01/2023 at 10:47:53\nThe fans were worried that the Portuguese nut job was going to be appointed by good old Moshiri and his agent friend and Frank was the only other name, apart from Dunc on the very short list.\nNaturally many of us thought that Frank was the best out of that lot.\nIf we had a poll on here we would be split in many directions.\nBielsa is an interesting one. His attacking intent might be the way to get the seven wins, many think we need, but perhaps it will just not work and we end up getting smashed.\nDyche might instill some organisation and fight but not grind out enough points.\nPerhaps the appointment should be for a guy who can take us back up if the unthinkable happens. In which case either one of them has proven history of doing that.\nRooney is a romantic left field choice that could work.\nHowever listening to media talk, it seems that Moshiri has spoken to Bielsa.\nI wonder if the Director of football proposed that?\nOr are we seeing history repeating itself with the owner interfering once again in football matters.\nI notice that Stubbs has been criticising Moshiri and the media like this narrative. It seems that Bill is escaping any serious blame for anything...\n469 Posted 24/01/2023 at 10:51:19\nFirst lets become hard to play against especially at Goodison. Clean sheets have to take priority, be organised and stop making errors that cost us goals.\nLets get the ball into the opponents box from wide areas be more direct and get DCL on the pitch more alongside a strike partner.\nLets just get basic things across and working well. Basics should not be beyond the squad we have as I don't see them having much more than that.\nWho we should bring in to drag this out of the players I have no idea but we pray its the right choice for once.\n470 Posted 24/01/2023 at 10:57:56\n471 Posted 24/01/2023 at 11:06:34\n472 Posted 24/01/2023 at 11:30:45\nNow we must choose the right person. As far as I am concerned, Bielsa is the man. With Rooney we will be relegated.\nBielsa will require the mercenaries to run and he will have no problem removing them from the team. He is also risky and works the offensive system unlike Lampard who does not understand that to win you have to score goals.\n473 Posted 24/01/2023 at 11:40:15\nI think there was a poll at the time on here. What I do remember is that there was a real groundswell of opinion favouring Frank. I also remember people being delighted he was appointed.\nMichael has a point. A lot of the people who were celebrating his appointment are now pointing the finger at the board.\nMany of the people celebrated the appointment of our Italian manager are now complaining about bad managerial appointments.\nEven if we confine the debate to TW alone. I can remember huge numbers praising \"Tell it like it is\" Koeman.\nMoshiri made two deeply unpopular appointments when he hired Sam ad Rafa and there was a genuine backlash But there are a lot of people pointing fingers at him for appointments they applauded at the time...They cant have it both ways.\nThe current school of thought which suggest's all managers are doomed and nobody can do anything at this club, or with this team, is going to be severely tested if the next manager comes in and steers us to safety\n474 Posted 24/01/2023 at 11:43:45\nNow we are reading more about the Doucoure bust up and a toxic dressing room, it seems maybe Lampard was too nice to get a tune out of this bunch of players?! As well as someone more tactically adept, we need someone in who will not stand for any nonsense from the squad and be a real hardcase when needs be.\nWould love to see what would happen if Doucoure mouthed off at someone like Big Dunc, as he is said to have done at Lampard. He wouldn't know what hit him! Maybe he should focus on improving his game and actually playing well if that's his gripe- then managers would pick him.\nCan't see Bielsa working out if we get him - he is a good manager granted but our lot are too unfit to play the way he will want too. Will only end in disaster at this point in the season.\n475 Posted 24/01/2023 at 11:58:42\nWhat job is Pochetinho waiting for, should he not be no.1 choice\n476 Posted 24/01/2023 at 11:59:52\nI am well documented as being:\n1. On the fence with Frank. Never convinced or bought in.\n2. Disappointed with the appointment of Benitez.\n3. Excited at Ancellotti - hindsight tells us wrong person for the wrong club.\n4. Concerned at Marco Silva although I though we should have given him more time. Doing well at Fulham.\n5. Allardyce. I'll leave it there.\n6. Koeman. Hoodwinked into thinking the player I watched as a kid would become a great manager.\n7. Martinez. Initial thoughts were just say no.\nWe are going through managers like a butcher at Christmas with Turkeys.\nAs I keep saying, I really don't care who the next one is right now, because, let's face it, with our track record, it will only be a short term appointment.\nI just want the team to get results.\n477 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:08:55\nHe did seem like a breath of fresh air in his early press conferences, dry and to the point. After Martinez and his bullshit nonesense, Koeman seemed a good fit.\nAllardyce was undermined by people at the club, putting out a survey to fans marking him out of ten!\nThe club has interfered with all of the recruitment and we can look back at the utter dross we bought and crazy contracts we signed. Ashley Williams, Sigurdsson, Tosun, Bollassie, Schneiderlin to name a few.\nI have no idea who will be in charge od recruiting or the shortlist. I have no faith in our club to get it right.\nIn the fallout that is now rebounding around various media outlets Frank is being given an easy ride and so are Bill and Denise.\nMoshiri is copping the flak.\nI saw Don Hutchinson chipping in on Frank's side complaining that he had nothing to spend in his first summer. He conveniently forgot about McNeil, Maupay and Onana, plus Gana, Tarkowski and the loans.\nFrank was dreadful and the narrative that he was dealt a poor hand is not quite true.\nThere are other clubs who are doing better than us who had less to spend than Frank in the summer.\nI also thought Frank was a good appointment but I got sick of him last season with his \"there are 23 games and 79 points still to play for\" bollocks. This season it was the broken record \"having played in important games\".\nI am surprised so many on here kept faith in him for so long.\nWhat a mess we are in.\n478 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:15:04\n479 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:29:26\nIf the players cant handle the running then so what, at least it proves they are a shower of mercenaries and outs them for what we all suspect.\nGo down with a fight and not a whimper.\n480 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:31:31\nBielsa on the other hand would be an interesting proposition but given the lack of “up and downâ€ players at the club and the fact that he'd need a full pre-season to get the players up to his level of fitness, I think he'd be a disastrous appointment.\nConclusion, you can only choose from the limited options available and though we might not have chosen a particular manager, we've just got to get on with it and support him while in post. So Dyche for me because the now takes precedence over the future as things stand.\nBy the way, anyone thinking that relegation could be a good opportunity for the club to re-set is misguided in my opinion. Pre PL days, as in Man. Ute's case, it was possible to bounce back with only a few bruises but the loss of Sky money and sponsorship could be a one way road to oblivion.\n481 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:39:14\n482 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:43:45\n483 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:44:56\n484 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:49:16\nWe need an experienced hand in charge now Lampard was too green for the job and inexperienced. It was too big an ask.\n485 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:55:51\nBielsa with a championship squad finished above Ancelotti's Everton. Ancelotti was given 63 million net to spend which was the third highest in our history. Koeman spent 75 million net when he took us to seventh. Silva got 66 million net the season he finished eighth. Ancelotti's 63 million net produced a tenth place finish.\nConversely Bielsa had a bunch of journeymen, many of whom like Bamford had failed in the Premier League before, and players like Dallas and Cooper who were never deemed good enough until the twilight of their careers.\nAncelotti had a world class keeper, two top international full backs, decent Premier League quality centre halves and top frontmen like Richarlison and Calvert Lewin. Ancelotti was lucky to have Dominic fit as in the five games without him he picked up five points which was similarly dismal as the last two wallies. He was tasked with sorting out the midfield and brought three players, two of which were allegedly world class according to the Maestro.\nAll three have had to be smuggled out the back door and Allan's ejection from the team last season was a major factor in our survival. Did the 'best defensive midfielder in the world' leave us for Barcelona or City, no he went to Al Wahda. The other James had his contract terminated by Al Rayann. Doucoure will be gone this window also.\nSurely those who believe Ancelotti was some sort of success should be advocating for Moyes who finished four places and six points above him with a slightly weaker squad. Or Bielsa who finished above him with a much inferior squad. Or Dean Smith who finished a place below with a one man team.\n486 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:57:33\nThat is where we have failed in the last ten years, selling the few quality players we have had and buying replacements of poor physical and/or mental quality.\n487 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:58:14\nIt's not whether or not those directly involved with the team have been good bad or indifferent. It's whether they are being 'allowed' to do their job. Marcel Brands partially let the cat out of the bag, implying he hadn't been allowed to do his job as he would have liked?? Your post implies that everyone who posts anything about a Manager or board are incorrect? I would be interested to know why you think our club is in such a mess, and where the responsibility lies.\n488 Posted 24/01/2023 at 12:59:37\nJoe - BBC and others suggesting Bielsa, Dyche or Rooney in the frame. I feel another / a continuing screw-up.\n489 Posted 24/01/2023 at 13:04:31\nThe current DOF should have to report to him. They should then decide on who the new manager should be. All current Board members along with the Owner should be side lined from the process.\n490 Posted 24/01/2023 at 13:17:56\nNow, where were we?\n491 Posted 24/01/2023 at 13:21:08\n492 Posted 24/01/2023 at 13:25:46\n494 Posted 24/01/2023 at 13:27:29\nFor 36 years.\nWe can keep blaming managers all we want but the cause is deeper than Ancelotti, Moyes or Lampard.\n495 Posted 24/01/2023 at 13:33:39\n496 Posted 24/01/2023 at 13:39:47\n497 Posted 24/01/2023 at 13:42:35\nGone are the days of a Moyes staying in place for 11 years. Chelsea showed that chopping and changing works.\nObviously, before FFP rules, they could afford to give each new manager lots of money.\nHowever, it is clear from seeing how many teams fare, that players become stale, coaches reach a point where they too run out of gas.\nLook at West Ham. A decent squad, well -drilled and finishing seventh and last season sixth under Moyes.\nThis season, they have spent money with the intent to play more football but find themselves down with us.\nBielsa has Leeds flying for a while. Klopp has suddenly found his charges no longer responding to his bullying(sorry man-management).\nSpanish and Italian sides seem ready to change coaches regularly.\nI think we might be surprised at what a new coach can do with the likes of Gordon, Godfrey, Patterson and Onana.\n498 Posted 24/01/2023 at 13:52:36\n499 Posted 24/01/2023 at 13:58:22\nI know we need a quick fix. I honestly believe, there is nothing much wrong with the first team, it was bad, bad coaching.\nWith saying that and looking, who is out there. I see a young foreign coach, who took over bottom club West Brom from Steve Bruce and turned them into promotion candidates. He did well at Huddersfield.\nCarlos Corberàn. 32. done a great job.\n500 Posted 24/01/2023 at 14:05:56\nDo we want cold, calculated, passing football with this bunch? Or, do we want blood and thunder, passionate football with our dimwitted, slow moving players?\n501 Posted 24/01/2023 at 14:09:17\nHis win ratio at Everton was second only to HK1 and the team was within 3 points of a European spot going into the last game of the season - we'd all dream of that now. He was written off by some as over the hill and only here for the money, but then made a mockery of these claims by winning La Liga (his 5th league title in 5 countries) and the Champions League (his 4th overall) the very next season.\nBielsa might be right for Everton given our lowly position. He will make the team fast, high energy and intense. But, frankly there is no comparison between him and Ancelotti - 21 top trophies for Ancelotti compared to the Copa Del Rey runner-up and English Championship winner for Bielsa. Let's be serious for a moment.\nBielsa was sacked into his second season in the Premiership with Leeds when they were 16th February. Like Dyche, he got sacked for a reason and it was results - the same reason as Lampard's sacking.\n502 Posted 24/01/2023 at 14:13:12\nAlso you would probably only get till the end of the season if relegated which looks very likely. Yes you would get a few bob in compensation but is it worth all the hassle. While Moshiri makes the decisions things wont improve, you would think by now he would have learned a little about running a football club. But the truth is he has never been interested in the job but had to do what his boss told him to do, and now having to do it without the financial backing of his boss makes life a lot harder.\nI am sure Usmanov is working very hard behind the scenes to extricate him and Moshiri from the financial mess they have got into. I suspect that they will be looking for a buyer for the club, and if thats not possible then sell the ground to a 3rd party who can do what the owners of the Ricoh Arena did to Coventry. And given how much we are in debt we may end up like Derby and drop more than 1 division before we can get things back on a more stable financial footing.\n503 Posted 24/01/2023 at 14:13:56\nI know where the responsibility lies and I new where it lay before He got here 6 years or so ago and I have banged the drum against Kenwright as long as anyone on here.\nThat doesnt mean to say I don't expect anything from our managers who earn more than 99 % of the other managers around the world.\nIf my post implied that I believe anyone who posts criticism or blame at the managers OR the board, are wrong. Then I pitched it right. I definitely think they are wrong.\nI don't think this is an either/or situation, Karen. The board have been a shambles for years and every single manager has took the money and gone along with it. So have the players...Accountability left this club decades ago\nMaybe it is partially our fault after all. Maybe we should have refused to be emotionally blackmailed and withdrawn our support for this shite years ago. and the only way we can find our way back, is to re-introduce it\nIt would have been painful for all of us, but we wouldnt be where we are now\n504 Posted 24/01/2023 at 14:14:49\n505 Posted 24/01/2023 at 14:17:53\n506 Posted 24/01/2023 at 14:27:31\n507 Posted 24/01/2023 at 14:29:08\nI think you know I meant Knew with a K, but the edit time had lapsed before I noticed it\n508 Posted 24/01/2023 at 14:29:48\n509 Posted 24/01/2023 at 14:32:22\n510 Posted 24/01/2023 at 14:39:56\n511 Posted 24/01/2023 at 14:46:43\nOur pursuit of him was pathetic and embarrassing and was the beginning of the end. It's all water under the bridge now but the red lights were already flashing and I for one chose to ignore them.\n512 Posted 24/01/2023 at 14:47:43\na well deflected post typical of the Ancelotti fan club. Unfortunately at Everton he couldn't just rely on his tactical nous where he could at Real. He had to improve players and build the club, something he failed badly at.\nThe reason we are in the mess currently is because the last manager who had huge investment and no outgoings failed miserably, and the club have had to spend most of the Richarlison kitty on the area Ancelotti was tasked to fix.\nPreviously you put up that ridiculous stat and I tore it apart then. But just to repeat Ancelotti was one of the few managers who wasn't sacked so his job had not yet become untenable skewing those figures. Compare Martinez first eighteen months to Ancelotti's and Martinez blows him out of the water.\nAgain you argue how close he was to Europe. That only tells you how the big clubs all failed to deal with their intense Covid schedule. Moyes West Ham finished in Europe, Bielsa's Leeds finished above him and Smiths Villa not far behind. These teams had a similar schedule to Everton. We finished so close due to the unique conditions of that season.\nThe rest of your argument as usual talks about what a great career Ancelotti had which nobody disputes but unfortunately we are talking about Everton.But in fairness to you as someone who was against Ancelotti's appointment and advocated Pochettino or Arteta and believes it was a failed experiment which has set the club back, I must agree with you in the position we are currently in I would definitely take Carlo right now as eeking enough points to stay up is everything and his nous and bit of Savvy may get us over the line.\nIncidentally last season with Barcelona having to sell all their players and were in a total mess Real had a penalty kick. I put my money where my mouth is and I had my biggest bet for five years that Barca will win the league at 6-4. I have no doubts I will be collecting.\n513 Posted 24/01/2023 at 14:52:57\n514 Posted 24/01/2023 at 14:55:51\nFor a new manager. When you look around at all the top premier league managers the likes of the Potters, Klopps, Conte's and other top managers they all started at the bottom and built strong organized teams, and were most probably allowed mistakes. We need one of these types of managers who are ready for the next step from having started at the bottom and built strong organized teams.\nAny manager we bring in will not have any time to bring in the type of player he wants, he will have to go with what he has got. What we need is a manager that can turn what we have into a structured team with a game plan that works, not necessary the one he wants, but one that will suit the players we have.\nI understand we are critical of them at times, but we do have some decent players they just need to be organized.\nRebuilding is out of the Question we are in the need for survival, and that means we need a manager who is willing to survive to be given the chance to rebuild. We don't need a proven manager who is just coming for a pay off.\nI live in North America, and the clue to why I support Everton, The street I was born in \" Broadway one end Littlewoods the other end \"\nHopefully the clueless, and we all know who they are, manage to get it right for once and pick the correct manager.\n515 Posted 24/01/2023 at 15:16:08\n516 Posted 24/01/2023 at 15:24:37\n517 Posted 24/01/2023 at 15:41:40\nPassion.\n518 Posted 24/01/2023 at 16:19:06\nBut, Conor took the bait as expected.\n519 Posted 24/01/2023 at 16:25:27\nHe was a Koeman signing. At least infers Sigurdsson was a Walsh. Doesn't go into who had Wayne signed, other than he was excited to be playing with him.\nIt's all done and dusted now, but still an interesting perspective from someone immediately affected by managerial changes.\nHe is frank about going from a life in the Ajax system as opposed to England's Premier League.\nAlso interesting to me is how the Club put it about that Vlasic forced his move out as opposed to Klaassen stating that he, Sandro, and Vlasic were brought in by Allardyce and told they weren't going to play, so go find a club and they could leave.\nAnd he spoke well of Silva.\nA good read:\nDavy Klaassen exclusive: â€˜Everton signed me, Rooney and Sigurdsson. I thought, “What is this?â€'\nEditorial Team\n520 Posted 24/01/2023 at 16:54:51\nThanks for being a long-time reader â€“ we know there are an awful lot of you out there who read the site without posting, and that's just fine... unless perhaps you really want to post but are put off by the nasty bullies in the playground who are going to jump on your every word and beat you to a pulp.\nThat's my job! — No, just kidding...

You will be extradited and You will be brought to justice.\nPost some more\n522 Posted 24/01/2023 at 17:46:26\nPlaying into the hands of the real culprits.\nIt started in 1987 in my lifetime and it wasn't Colin Harvey's fault. Some of an older generation will go back to selling Alan Ball and the break up of the 1970 title winning team.\nBlame Ancelotti all you want. This situation has been decades in the making because of the way the club has been run.\n523 Posted 24/01/2023 at 17:51:43\n524 Posted 24/01/2023 at 17:54:57\n525 Posted 24/01/2023 at 18:01:49\n1) Criminal ineptitude.\n2) Deliberately planned\nI'm actually contemplating number two. This is Bills “fuck youâ€ to the fans. A sinister stab in the back as he saw the tide turning. Gordon and Onana being pushed out (just like Rooney was before him) and I'd hazard a bet it was us that sat on Danjuma forms for 10 days too.\nHis risk is negligible financially, and Moshiri is too far away and too trusting to see the snake for what it is. He'll be kiboshing any manager at all for the next week, and I'd be surprised if we appoint or sign anyone before the deadline. We'll then get Rooney and/or Duncan in with the panto of saviours.\nThe balance sheet will look £100m better with Gordon, Onana, Keane, Holgate and Doucoure gone. Wouldn't be surprised to see DCL gone too if a bid comes in. We go down, Moshiri can't finish the stadium, a new investor comes in (but Bill keeps his shares) and Moshiri sells both the club and stadium for peanuts.\nIf the Phoenix rises he'll still have his shares. If it doesn't, welllllll it was all that mad Iranian geezers faultâ€¦.hey “did you know it was really laundered for putin?â€\nSounds like a fooking novelâ€¦..but anyone who reads this and dismisses it has not been paying attention at all.\n526 Posted 24/01/2023 at 18:12:44\nI hope it is Blood brothers he is going watching at the Royal court and not heading to Finch farm.\n527 Posted 24/01/2023 at 18:14:39\nFor the record and being hilariously pedantic, it is super, but it's the Goodison Supper Bar. Oh, it feels good to jump all over a spelling mistake, I'll be walking tall for the rest of the day.\nAnd yes, I think we are all going mental. If a crouton is floating in tomato soup, it's going to taste a bit like tomato soup.\n528 Posted 24/01/2023 at 18:20:02\n529 Posted 24/01/2023 at 18:25:20\nIf all of the rumours are to be believed it seems the club are trying to balance the books and plan on the unthinkable.\nWell fuck them. I can't think the unthinkable and won't do so.\n530 Posted 24/01/2023 at 19:01:06\nThe club really does seem to be teetering on the brink. Is there anyone who can get better performances from our seemingly traumatised players.\n531 Posted 24/01/2023 at 19:16:44\nI was at West Ham on Saturday and again, you could see manager and players were not connected and team lacked confidence.\nI don't like the \"told you so\" narrative, but I think if you look at Frank's track record, you would struggle to see him as a top coach or manager. Okay, maybe he got unlucky at Chelsea, but to counter that view, look at the players he had at his disposal. The same squad that went on to win the Champions League under Tuchel.\nNow there's a name, but no chance he would consider us right now.\n532 Posted 24/01/2023 at 19:25:55\n533 Posted 24/01/2023 at 19:28:38\n534 Posted 24/01/2023 at 19:45:20\nmanager's under Moshiri, is at fault for the current predicament, and you mention his 'huge investment', are you having a laugh? He signed Doucoure, Godfrey, Allan and Rodriguez on a free, the first two I'd say he didn't know who they were. Compare that to the mess Koeman left us with?\n535 Posted 24/01/2023 at 20:47:29\nI tell you what is funny though Christy is when the likes of yourself and Danny blew smoke up Carlo's arse and hailed players like as Allan as world class. When the shit hits the fan on his disastrous spell then suddenly it goes back to 1987 for the mess we are in.\nWhen Arteta came into Arsenal the common perception on Tofffeeweb was that we had a superior squad to them. Look at every player the Spaniard has signed. He had to fight Edu to get Ramsdale and he was laughed at by every pundit for forking out 30 million on him. He along with Edu has built them piece by piece with a clear coherent vision. When I mentioned what was happening previously to Danny he told me that it was only because I loved Arteta and couldn't see what I was talking about. The proof is now in the pudding.\nWhere I differ from most of our fans is that they see managers like Moyes and Martinez as failures. We have no divine right to win anything. In the Premier League Era only Leicester and Wigan upset the apple cart in minor miracles where the Gods smiled on them as in most other years their Herculean efforts may have been left unrewarded. If the Gods had smiled on us Martinez would have brought an FA Cup to our cabinet room.\nOur owner who allegedly has put his money where his mouth is had spent a total of 310 million net, a fifth of which backed Ancelotti. Chelsea have spent more than that this window. Put in the best chairman, best board, best manager possible and we in all likelihood won't be winning trophies pretty soon. Look at Tottenham as a template.\nWe of course are a badly run club from top to bottom, especially since that clown Moshiri set foot in the building but those expecting a change in leadership to bring back the glory days are living in cloud cuckoo land. Man City got some of the richest people in the world on board, ran the club like a dream from top to bottom and still took them the guts of a decade before the fruits of their labour was borne.\nWe can all dream but our only priority now should be staying in the division by any means necessary.\n536 Posted 24/01/2023 at 21:34:28\n537 Posted 25/01/2023 at 06:30:26\nRegarding your 1987 jibe, I watch Everton a lot (some say too much) and when I analyse it, the lack of investment in the club over decades has led us to where we are now in my opinion. Not a series of managers who's average life span over the past several years has been 12 months.\nThe dark days of the 90s when the not too distant champions very nearly got relegated twice on the last day of the season. 36 years? By the second time in 1998, it had only been 11.\nBeing hypnotised into accepting mediocracy as success under the Kenwright-Moyes coalition.\nIrresponsibly throwing money at a problem but spending it like someone who has just won on the roulette wheel in a Las Vegas hotel and walking down the strip throwing dollar bills into the air.\nThere are many factors. Some, will target managers, even individual ones. I'm now more looking at how the club has been run. It comes from the top.\n1987? Some would go back further. Apart from Howard's ray of sunshine that put us back and gave us a potential platform to build on, the 70s and early 80s were not an easy ride.\n538 Posted 26/01/2023 at 01:30:51\nCan you even see Goodison Park from where you live?\nNo â€“ Australia is a bit too far away.\nWhat did you say to Graeme Sharp last time you spoke to him?\nI have never met him â€“ so nothing\nDo you have a tab behind the counter at the Goodison Super Bar?\nNo\nFrom how many Everton away games have you been physically ejected?\nNone â€“ even though I was drunk and disorderly at quite few of them\nHave you ever been caught \"bunking-in\"?\nNever caught but I remember my dad lifting me over the Goodison Rd turnstiles\nDo you have a programme from the 2016 4th Round League Cup tie vs Norwich City?\nNo\nDo you remember seeing Bill Kenwright as a scally in the Boys Pen?\nNo â€“ if he was in there he wasn't one of the lads climbing up the cyclone wire\nHave you ever said anything nasty about Tom Davies?\nMaybe ??\nHave you ever said anything nice about Frank Lampard?\nYes but does it count because I never wanted him in the first place and called for his sacking after Bournemouth week.\nWhat is the chessiest item with an EFC logo in your possession?\nSee attached picture\nUp the Blues!!!\n539 Posted 26/01/2023 at 13:06:31\n540 Posted 26/01/2023 at 13:18:20\nIf you strike out Howard's managerial period post Oxford to winning his second Championship, the past 50 years have been very poor with very few good times, it's been downhill since Alan Ball was allowed to leave.\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
