  "body_text": "Former Chelsea and Manchester City winger Raheem Sterling has joined Dutch club Feyenoord on a deal until the end of the season.\nThe England international left Chelsea by mutual consent in January after agreeing a settlement package with the Stamford Bridge club over the final 18 months of his contract, worth in excess of £300,000-per-week.\nSterling, 31, has spent time discussing numerous options, but joined Feyenoord, who are second in the Eredivisie table and managed by former Manchester United and Arsenal striker Robin van Persie.\nFollow us on WhatsApp | LinkedIn for the latest headlines\n\"As a free agent, I've had, for the first time in a long time, the opportunity to control the next step,\" he said.\n\"In my career. I wanted to take my time to speak with clubs and their head coaches to better understand the role they envisioned for me and ensure that I can add real value in this next chapter.\n\"Having spoken in great detail with Robin, I'm confident that Feyenoord is a place I can be happy and establish myself as a valued member of the team. Playing abroad is a whole new challenge for me - and one I'm ready to embrace. Honestly, I'm just excited to get started.\"\nFeyenoord are 17 points behind league leaders PSV and Van Persie added: \"Naturally it's a fantastic feat that we've managed to convince a player of Raheem's calibre to sign with us.\n\"His football resume speaks for itself: he's a player whose qualities can change the outcome of a game without a doubt, and I am convinced he will turn out to be a valuable addition to the team as we work towards achieving our goals in the second half of this season.\"\nSources told BBC Sport that around 18 clubs in England and across Europe expressed an interest in Sterling.\nThe opportunity to play in a competitive league, to help Feyenoord achieve Champions League qualification and Van Persie's vision for his role in the team persuaded the forward to move to Holland.\nAfter joining Chelsea from Manchester City in July 2022, Sterling was supposed to be the face of a new era at Stamford Bridge.\nIn his first two seasons, the England international featured in 59 out of a possible 76 Premier League games under four different managers during a turbulent few years under the BlueCo ownership.\nBut after Chelsea appointed Enzo Maresca as manager in June 2024, the forward was loaned to Premier League rivals Arsenal after being deemed surplus to requirements by the Italian.\nHowever, after failing to impress during an underwhelming loan spell with the Gunners, Sterling was one of several players banished to the Chelsea 'bomb squad' by Maresca and made available for transfer last summer.\nHis move to Feyenoord draws the line under a difficult final two years with the London club.\n'Big for the Eredivisie'\nThis is big for the Eredivisie - but also for people in Holland, where the English game is really popular.\nSterling has been part of the Premier League for so long and achieved big things, especially with Manchester City.\nWhen players who have won the Premier League in England, like Jordan Henderson and Sterling, come to Holland it is a bit like \"wow, is this really happening?\"\nWithout them even kicking a ball or playing it already gives an extra layer of allure, or something special, to the Eredivisie.\nLet's see how it goes in a football sense, but I think Sterling still has a decent level and especially for the Eredivisie - so it could work out for player and club.\nHe might get the fun back of playing football, and Feyenoord boss Robin van Persie knows England well.\nSterling can just enjoy himself, and a lot of people will really like the fact he is playing. That could be a bonus for what he is able to show on the pitch.\nHe could have a similar impact to Henderson last year at Ajax, putting in good performances on the pitch and then showing his leadership in the dressing room.\nSterling is used to the highest standards at clubs like Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool.\nIf he can help bring the level of professionalism and way of working from those clubs, that can only be a positive thing for Feyenoord.",
