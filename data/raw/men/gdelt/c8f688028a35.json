  "body_text": "More than 1,200 players will travel to the World Cup finals next June.\nThe joy of a tournament like this is that these players will range from the biggest and richest superstars in the world game to those who are barely professionals. Yet for a few weeks, they will be thrown together to compete for the biggest prize in the sport.\nAdvertisement\nAmong those 1,200-plus will be a relatively small number of the elite. So with that in mind, we have picked who we think will be the 100 best players at the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\nThese sorts of articles are, inevitably, subjective. But we have tried to include some more measurable criteria to come up with the order for our 100, and so we created five categories, with each player awarded a mark between one and five. These scores were then totted up, and placed in order.\nThe five categories are:\n- Current form – for this, we used scores provided by FotMob for how each individual is playing this season.\n- Historical performance — we’ll be honest, this was subjectively awarded, based on each player’s career achievements, both individually and as part of a team.\n- Importance to their nation — same as above, a subjective score out of five given to each man, based on how key we think they will be to their country at the 2026 World Cup.\n- Transfer value — this was taken from Transfermarkt, but a crucial point must be made here: this tended to disproportionately penalise the older guys, whose transfer value is inherently lower but whose impact at this World Cup will not necessarily be less significant than a player 10 years younger than them. Therefore, we halved the weighting of this category.\n- Rating on FC26 — you may well scoff at this, but an astonishing amount of research goes into how players are rated on these games, and frankly it’s about as good a method of objectively determining an individual’s quality as any widely available.\nSo that’s how we came up with the list.\nYou may well disagree. There are players who didn’t make our top 100 who perhaps deserved to, and there may well be names on the list who won’t make it to the World Cup for various reasons, but we’re pretty happy with how it all shook out.\nEnjoy.\n1. Kylian Mbappe (France)\nAge: 26 Position: Forward\nIt feels like we sometimes take for granted just how good Mbappe is. A scorer in the past two World Cup finals (including a hat-trick in the 2022 edition), he’s still the man around whom France are built, and any fears that a move to Real Madrid could have hampered his club form can be answered by the fact he’s scoring at better than a goal per game for them this season. The French are among the favourites for the 2026 World Cup, and he’ll still be their decisive man.\n2. Erling Haaland (Norway)\nAge: 25 Position: Forward\nIt’s a compliment to Haaland that the word ‘freak’ comes to mind so often when summing up his game and his record. There is no one else like him. A human bulldozer who can score almost any type of goal imaginable. And now we get to watch him at a World Cup… there is justice in the world.\n3. Lamine Yamal (Spain)\nAge: 18 Position: Forward\nHe won’t turn 19 until a few days before the final on July 19, but Yamal is already among the world’s best. What’s remarkable is that there seems to have been very little lead-up to his journey to this point: he arrived perfectly formed, as he did when playing a key role as Spain won the 2024 European Championship. You wouldn’t bet against him repeating the trick at the World Cup.\nAdvertisement\n4. Harry Kane (England)\nAge: 32 Position: Forward\nA model striker, a model footballer, a model professional, just a perfect specimen of what a modern centre-forward should be. He is the record goalscorer for both Tottenham Hotspur and England, and is now breaking records in the German Bundesliga with Bayern Munich, too. If there was much of a ‘Kane brand’ he’d be a global superstar, but his unassuming nature is all part of the charm.\n5. Pedri (Spain)\nAge: 23 Position: Midfielder\nThe man who helps both club and country make sense, Pedri’s international career has been pockmarked by injuries, not least the one that meant he missed the business end of Spain’s Euro 2024 triumph. But he’s very much part of coach Luis de la Fuente’s furniture in an absurdly talented midfield.\n6. Jude Bellingham (England)\nAge: 22 Position: Midfielder\nA tornado of desire who has elevated his game to incredible heights. Knowing what Bellingham is going to do on the pitch is one thing, stopping him is another, because of that unstinting ambition and drive. But will he even get in the England team next summer? It’s hard to imagine they can win the World Cup without him.\n7. Vinicius Junior (Brazil)\nAge: 25 Position: Forward\nThis will be Vinicius Jr’s second World Cup, but the first where he will be truly out of fellow forward Neymar’s shadow. For all the apparent turmoil in his relationship with Real Madrid, he is still one of the most electrifying players in the game, and under new manager Carlo Ancelotti, who got the best from him in Spain, he will be the man Brazil look to.\n8. Lionel Messi (Argentina)\nAge: 38 Position: Forward\nWords are difficult at this point, so perhaps this should just be a picture of an achingly beautiful golden sunset over a pristine-perfect Miami beach. It will be every football fan’s true pleasure to watch this higher self perform at one more World Cup.\n9. Kevin De Bruyne (Belgium)\nAge: 34 Position: Midfielder\nMaybe the glory days of Belgium’s golden generation are behind them, but De Bruyne is still among the best midfielders in the world. The big question will be over his fitness: he started this season in superb form for Napoli, but at the time of writing is on the sidelines. If fit, De Bruyne will still be one of the tournament’s dominant performers, even though he’ll turn 35 during it.\nAdvertisement\n10. Gianluigi Donnarumma (Italy)\nAge: 26 Position: Goalkeeper\nIn age terms, he’s not even halfway through his career yet, but he has already made 500 appearances for club and country. Donnarumma has the ability to produce saves which elicit cartoon-style rubbing of eyeballs. If Italy don’t qualify via the UEFA play-offs in March, it will mean the game’s best keeper has still yet to appear at a World Cup, which is like banning Paul McCartney from Glastonbury.\n11. Virgil van Dijk (Netherlands)\nAge: 34 Position: Defender\nMan for man, the Dutch arguably have the best set of defenders at this tournament. At the heart of it all is Van Dijk, and that is a big part of why he ranks so highly in these ratings: if the Netherlands are to go far in this tournament, it will be based on a unit that conceded just four goals in their eight qualifiers.\n12. Rodri (Spain)\nAge: 29 Position: Midfielder\nManchester City still haven’t recovered from Rodri’s long-term knee injury early in the 2024-25 season, with his continued fitness issues in its wake leaving a gap that feels impossible to fill without spending a fortune. The smooth, metronomic beat to which a Champions League and European Championship have been won.\n13. Vitinha (Portugal)\nAge: 25 Position: Midfielder\nA year ago, shrewd judges would be tapping their noses and quietly telling you what a player this guy is. Vitinha is mainstream now: he came third in the Ballon d’Or voting in September, and you could easily argue he was more important to Paris Saint-Germain’s successes last season than that award’s winner Ousmane Dembele. A whirling, relentless figure with and without the ball, Vitinha could be one of the stars of the World Cup.\n14. Raphinha (Brazil)\nAge: 28 Position: Forward\nThe make-up of Brazil’s World Cup attack isn’t quite clear yet but Raphinha will be in it, bringing his whirlwind of skill, pace and ingenuity, whichever flank he plays on. He operates in the shadow of Vinicius Jr and Yamal for country and club, but his end product is ridiculous (34 goals and 26 assists in 57 games for Barcelona last season).\nAdvertisement\n15. Luis Diaz (Colombia)\nAge: 28 Position: Forward\nColombia will be led by their captain and talisman James Rodriguez, now 34, but the team’s biggest threat will be Diaz. The winger has been an absolute sensation since joining Bayern from Liverpool in the summer, and will be his nation’s key attacking threat at the World Cup. Undoubtedly one of the best in the game in his position.\n16. Bukayo Saka (England)\nAge: 24 Position: Forward\nIt is testament to Saka’s brilliance that players such as Phil Foden and Cole Palmer aren’t even discussed as a right-flank option for England at the 2026 World Cup. The shirt is Saka’s and, with Arsenal and possibly England on the cusp of doing something special in the coming months, you feel he is ready to become a truly great player. Exceptional at what he does — and he plays with such joy.\n17. Robert Lewandowski (Poland)\nAge: 37 Position: Forward\nWe’re now used to footballers in their late thirties playing on and looking like they’re 25, but even in that context Lewandowski is ridiculous. At 37, he doesn’t seem to be any different to when he was in his pomp with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern in Germany: he scored 42 goals in 52 games last season for Barcelona, and you’d back him to do similar in this one.\n18. Declan Rice (England)\nAge: 26 Position: Midfielder\nWith props to this summer’s arrival Martin Zubimendi for helping free him up in Arsenal’s midfield, Rice is a rare example of a huge-money signing actually being decent value. A linchpin for Arsenal and England, a natural leader, and a nice chap to boot.\n19. Mohamed Salah (Egypt)\nAge: 33 Position: Forward\nEgypt’s played-three-lost-three performance at the 2018 World Cup was a huge disappointment, and a significant factor must have been that Salah was only a few weeks removed from the shoulder injury that forced him off in the Champions League final. After failing to qualify four years later, they will hope he’s fully fit this time because, at his best, he’s among the greatest African players of all time, not just Egypt’s.\nAdvertisement\n20. Ousmane Dembele (France)\nAge: 28 Position: Forward\nYou may wonder why the 2025 Ballon d’Or winner is only 20th on our list, but his current form (owing to enduring an injury-hit season so far) rating is low, otherwise he’d have been in the top 10. At his best, Dembele is the footballing equivalent of human electricity.\n21. Moises Caicedo (Ecuador)\nAge: 24 Position: Midfielder\nIt feels like a long time ago now that people were fretting that Chelsea had paid too much money for Caicedo in August 2023. Now, that £115million ($152m at the current rate) almost looks like a bargain, and there’s a good case to be made that he’s the best central midfielder in the world. If Ecuador do anything at this tournament, it will be driven by Caicedo.\n22. Achraf Hakimi (Morocco)\nAge: 27 Position: Defender\nWhen Real Madrid let him go in 2020 after 17 first-team appearances, few would have predicted his career trajectory with both Paris Saint-Germain and Morocco. The highest-placed full-back on our list, Hakimi is the current African Footballer of the Year (the first Moroccan to win that award since 1998) and was sixth in the Ballon d’Or voting.\n23. Gabriel (Brazil)\nAge: 27 Position: Defender\nBrazilian football seems to be going through one of its semi-regular existential crises, but at least they can rely on the fact they have one of the best central defenders in the world. Gabriel has helped turn Arsenal into a virtually impregnable force, so if he can do the same for Brazil, that’s half their World Cup battle won.\n24. Michael Olise (France)\nAge: 23 Position: Forward\nFrom playing for Reading in England’s second-tier Championship to the Champions League with Bayern in three years, Olise has enjoyed a stellar rise which has also included cementing his position in the France team, despite some ridiculously tough competition.\nAdvertisement\n25. Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal)\nAge: 40 Position: Forward\nStill going, still scoring goals. If Ronaldo finds the net next summer, he’ll be the first to score at six World Cups, which is an astonishing achievement. As for why he’s not appeared on this list before now, it’s worth pointing out he hasn’t made the top 30 in the Ballon d’Or voting since 2021, so you could argue he’s actually too high. Will he defy time, or will this be the tournament when he slips from the spotlight?\n26. Thibaut Courtois (Belgium)\nAge: 33 Position: Goalkeeper\nEvery successful team needs an elite goalkeeper, and Courtois has won six league titles with three clubs in England and Spain. The world’s best keeper? He’s not quite the highest at his position on our list, with his lower value bringing him down a peg, but if you had to pick a goalkeeper to line up for you in a World Cup final, there would be no reason not to choose him.\n27. Federico Valverde (Uruguay)\nAge: 27 Position: Midfielder\nSo often part of the supporting cast for Real Madrid, Valverde is frequently the main man for his country, and will be even more so if striker Darwin Nunez’s edge is blunted after moving to play his club football in Saudi Arabia. He will be crucial to how Uruguay perform under Marcelo Bielsa: he’s perhaps the perfect Bielsa player, so if he performs as he can, they might just go far.\n28. Joshua Kimmich (Germany)\nAge: 30 Position: Midfielder\nOne of the most consistent performers on our list, and there aren’t many who can read a game better. Kimmich’s versatility is a huge plus for both Bayern and Germany. Only his comparatively low transfer value compared to more attacking players bumps him down our list a tad.\n29. Bruno Fernandes (Portugal)\nAge: 31 Position: Midfielder\nAt Manchester United, Fernandes often has to perform the roles of both string-puller and goalscorer, but he has a lot more help with Portugal. Sometimes, it looks as if that doesn’t entirely suit him, that he prefers to be the main man: maybe if Ronaldo, who’ll be 41 by then, doesn’t start every game at the World Cup, he can become that for his national team.\nAdvertisement\n30. Arda Guler (Turkey)\nAge: 20 Position: Midfielder\nOne of those ‘Worth the admission fee on his own’ type players who can bring a smile to your face with a threaded pass or a fancy bit of skill, Guler has had to be patient at Real Madrid but has come to the fore this season under new manager Xabi Alonso. If Turkey make it through the UEFA play-offs, he will be a great addition to the World Cup.\n31. Alessandro Bastoni (Italy)\nAge: 26 Position: Defender\nIt’s perhaps slightly surprising to see Bastoni so early on this list, but he had high ratings across the board and if you’ve watched him play for Inter, you might not be that shocked. A muscular yet elegant defender who can start (or finish) an attack just as well as he can shut your striker down. If Italy make it to the World Cup via those March play-offs, he will probably be their key man.\n32. Julian Alvarez (Argentina)\nAge: 25 Position: Forward\nPep Guardiola and Manchester City don’t make many mistakes in the transfer market, but letting Alvarez leave for Atletico Madrid in August 2024 still feels like a sizeable misstep. He has a better than one-in-two goals-to-games ratio for Atletico in La Liga and, as he showed with four goals in helping his country win the previous World Cup three years ago, can take his form to the biggest of stages.\n33. Luka Modric (Croatia)\nAge: 40 Position: Midfielder\nIs Modric the player he once was? No, probably not. Is he still an utter joy to watch, an experience that we should all cling to at the highest level while it lasts because, hey, the man turned 40 in September? Absolutely. At an age when most men are worried about how frequently they have to get up to use the toilet per night, Modric is leading his country to another World Cup and will probably win his 200th cap if they go well there.\nAdvertisement\n34. Jamal Musiala (Germany)\nAge: 22 Position: Midfielder\nIt was horrible to see the game robbed of one of its most delightful players through injury, but Musiala looks set to return soon after suffering a broken leg playing for Bayern in the summer’s Club World Cup. His injury obviously impacts his form rating on our list, but as anyone who watched Euro 2024 knows, Musiala can lay claim to being one of the best attacking midfielders in the world.\n35. Nuno Mendes (Portugal)\nAge: 23 Position: Defender\nThe best left-back in the world right now? Probably. He’s the highest from that position on our list. One feature common to most of the World Cup contenders is a relative weakness, or perhaps uncertainty, at full-back: expect no such problems for Portugal in 2026. Mendes established himself as elite during Paris Saint-Germain’s run to winning the Champions League last season, and he could well show that type of form again at this World Cup.\n36. Frenkie de Jong (Netherlands)\nAge: 28 Position: Midfielder\nSilky? Yes. Press-resistant? Yes. Glides through midfield with effortless ball control? Yes. De Jong, the ultimate tempo-dictator, the ultimate elegant midfielder. He has overcome positional and injury issues to become a key player for Barcelona and arguably the most important member of the current Dutch side.\n37. Son Heung-min (South Korea)\nAge: 33 Position: Forward\nIt’s been wonderful to watch Son flourish in MLS since his move to LAFC, because at some points in his last season or so at Tottenham, it almost felt a little sad that this previously glorious force was fading so rapidly. Now he seems revitalised, will potentially be playing ‘at home’, depending on the draw, and will be his nation’s leader again.\n38. Sadio Mane (Senegal)\nAge: 33 Position: Forward\nUndeniably one of the greatest African footballers of all time who, injury permitting, returns to the World Cup after missing the 2022 tournament through injury. Remains the focal point of Senegal’s attack and would be higher up this list were it not for his low transfer value.\nAdvertisement\n39. Christian Pulisic (United States)\nAge: 27 Position: Forward\nWhen the World Cup’s host nation has a standout star player, often the pressure on them is crushing — particularly if that status isn’t necessarily backed up with solid form. The good news for Pulisic, the USMNT, the tournament organisers and many beyond is there are no such worries here: he is in sparkling touch for Milan, and if he carries that into the tournament, the nation staging next July’s final could be a relevant force.\n40. Granit Xhaka (Switzerland)\nAge: 33 Position: Midfielder\nXhaka’s late-career renaissance has been one of European football’s nicer stories of recent years. From being booed and stripped of the Arsenal captaincy in 2019, to an unbeaten Bundesliga title with Bayer Leverkusen and now one of the Premier League’s best midfielders again with promoted Sunderland. He is Switzerland’s most important player, too.\n41. William Saliba (France)\nAge: 24 Position: Defender\nQuite rightly, the eye is drawn to France’s absurd array of attacking talent, but it is worth remembering they’ve got some of the best defenders in the world, too. The finest of those is Saliba, who has helped make the Arsenal back line resemble an iron wall: it’s remarkable to think, given his incredible composure, that he’s still just 24.\n42. Alisson (Brazil)\nAge: 33 Position: Goalkeeper\nIf you were building an archetypal modern goalkeeper, you’d probably just make Alisson, whose signing changed the game for Liverpool in July 2018. He remains a match-winner on his own, as he showed in Paris earlier this year, and is now one of Brazil’s greatest at his position.\n43. Alphonso Davies (Canada)\nAge: 25 Position: Defender\nDavies would probably have appeared earlier on this list if he hadn’t been injured for a big chunk of the calendar year. But if he can get back to his best after recovering from that anterior cruciate ligament tear eight months ago, he’s one of the most thrilling sights in the game — a perfect modern full-back who often looks more like a winger, but one who can defend too.\n44. Joao Neves (Portugal)\nAge: 21 Position: Midfielder\nA player with an endless list of attributes who is basically a manager’s dream. Versatile, mature beyond his years, energetic, composed and authoritative on the ball, Neves could do whatever he wants to in his career. So far, he’s already been a key part of a Champions League-winning side.\nAdvertisement\n45. Bruno Guimaraes (Brazil)\nAge: 28 Position: Midfielder\nOf all the midfielders in the world that you might choose to play against, Guimaraes would be near the bottom of the list. Utterly relentless, the type of opponent who would never give you a moment of peace: as well as applying this to his form at Newcastle United, he has become one of Brazil’s most important players.\n46. Florian Wirtz (Germany)\nAge: 22 Position: Midfielder\nAs you might imagine, Wirtz takes a huge hit here on the 2025-26 form metric after a very underwhelming start to life at Liverpool, otherwise he’d be heading towards the top 20. Form is temporary, as they say, and you’d expect Wirtz to thrive for Germany.\n47. Lautaro Martinez (Argentina)\nAge: 28 Position: Forward\nIt tells you plenty about the forward options available to head coach Lionel Scaloni that Lautaro is not a guaranteed starter for Argentina. He would walk into most other teams, and if he did play for someone else, he would be further up this list, his score having suffered in the ‘Importance to their nation’ column.\n48. Alexis Mac Allister (Argentina)\nAge: 26 Position: Midfielder\nA surprise breakout star at the 2022 World Cup, where he was a dainty fulcrum in Argentina’s midfield. Mac Allister is one of those players that every team needs; a rhythmic, dependable workhorse. Has suffered with form at Liverpool this season, but then who hasn’t?\n49. Ruben Dias (Portugal)\nAge: 28 Position: Defender\nGiven Portugal’s attacking options, it would be easy and understandable to forget about their defence. But they have one of the 2026 World Cup’s more solid performers there in Dias, who has quietly become among the most experienced and reliable defenders in Europe.\n50. Antonio Rudiger (Germany)\nAge: 32 Position: Defender\nOne of the highest-placed centre-backs in our list, Rudiger stands out for his dominance and aggression with both Germany and Real Madrid. A strong performer across the board in our metrics, only a lower transfer value pushes him slightly down the list.\nAdvertisement\n51. Mehdi Taremi (Iran)\nAge: 33 Position: Forward\nThis is the point on this list where a big score in a single category can boost a player’s ranking. Taremi might not be playing at the top level of club football these days (although he is banging them in for Greek champions Olympiacos), but he is still the key player and main goal threat for Iran: to illustrate the point, he scored twice in the game that qualified his country for this tournament, against Uzbekistan in March.\n52. Cody Gakpo (Netherlands)\nAge: 26 Position: Forward\nPerhaps a little underrated sometimes, but there is no arguing with his remarkably consistent record — Gakpo averages pretty much bang on 0.5 goals per 90 minutes across his career for club and country. Like his Liverpool team, his form has dropped a little this season, but he’s the most important player in the Dutch attack.\n53. Martin Odegaard (Norway)\nAge: 26 Position: Midfielder\nAfter what feels like years of underachievement, Norway are finally at a major tournament again, and if they are to make any impression on this World Cup then Haaland can’t do it all on his own. The good news is that one of the best strikers in the world has one of the game’s best creators supplying him. Odegaard would be ranked better than 53rd were it not for his injury issues, and his nation’s lack of recent success.\n54. Enzo Fernandez (Argentina)\nAge: 24 Position: Midfielder\nFernandez’s evolution into one of world football’s truly elite midfielders continues apace with his consistently improved Premier League form at Chelsea. A mainstay of the Argentina midfield, Fernandez not only sees the game in widescreen, he is both tenacious and creative in equal measure. His FC 26 rating drops him down the list, however.\n55. Jeremy Doku (Belgium)\nAge: 23 Position: Forward\nThe Manchester City winger has been part of the Belgian setup since he was 18, but it’s only in the past couple of years that he’s become one of their key men. Doku’s generation, alongside players such as Charles De Ketelaere and Leandro Trossard, and with youngsters such as 20-year-old Malick Fofana coming through, might not be as famous as the days of Eden Hazard and Dries Mertens, but they might turn out to be as effective.\n56. Josko Gvardiol (Croatia)\nAge: 23 Position: Defender\nIt feels like Gvardiol, arguably the best centre-back at Qatar 2022, has already been around for a very long time and, given his maturity levels, it is easy to think he is older than 23. Maybe it’s the beard, which, to be fair, looks thicker than the Amazon rainforest. Switches between centre-back and left-back for Manchester City and Croatia, and is a very consistent performer for both. Also a goal threat.\nAdvertisement\n57. Ryan Gravenberch (Netherlands)\nAge: 23 Position: Midfielder\nWhen he was at previous club Bayern, there was a sense that Gravenberch was extremely talented but didn’t quite have a defined role. Under Arne Slot at Liverpool, that has changed, and that’s been to the benefit of the Netherlands too, who now have an exceptional crop of midfielders to pick from.\n58. Willian Pacho (Ecuador)\nAge: 24 Position: Defender\nA nerveless centre-back who can be harder to run through than a brick wall, Pacho was a key part of Paris Saint-Germain’s Champions League success in 2025 and played every single minute of Ecuador’s World Cup qualification campaign, in which they kept a remarkable 13 clean sheets in their 18 matches and conceded just five goals.\n59. Marquinhos (Brazil)\nAge: 31 Position: Defender\nThis will be Brazil’s first World Cup since Germany 2006 without Thiago Silva, so Marquinhos is now the experienced head at the heart of their defence. He’s been performing that role for Paris Saint-Germain for some time now, and would be further up these rankings if injury hadn’t disrupted his domestic season so far.\n60. Trent Alexander-Arnold (England)\nAge: 27 Position: Defender\nOne of the most talented right-backs ever seen in English football but Alexander-Arnold currently finds himself playing second fiddle at Real Madrid following a summer move from Liverpool, and it is doubtful whether he will even be in the England squad at the World Cup. Has to be on this list, though, given his quite ridiculous ability.\n61. Jules Kounde (France)\nAge: 27 Position: Defender\nWhen he entered the wider public consciousness, Kounde was a centre-back. But he was shifted to the right side of defence out of necessity, and it’s now a position he very much owns for both Barcelona and France. His form this season hasn’t quite been his best, but you’d expect him to recover by the time the tournament arrives.\nAdvertisement\n62. Mike Maignan (France)\nAge: 30 Position: Goalkeeper\nA keeper who had to bide his time for many years, both in domestic football — Maignan was 22 before he started playing regularly for Lille — and internationally, where he was understudy to Hugo Lloris for many years. Now France’s undisputed No 1, and one of the world’s most consistent performers in goal.\n63. Nicolo Barella (Italy)\nAge: 28 Position: Midfielder\nAnother player who is technically not definitely at the tournament yet, but it would be remiss not to include Barella in these rankings. A brilliant all-round midfielder, he theoretically has it all, and was a key man when Italy won the European Championship in 2021. They will lean on him for success at this World Cup too… assuming they make it.\n64. Riyad Mahrez (Algeria)\nAge: 34 Position: Forward\nThere are the usual caveats about age and how he’s now playing in the Saudi Pro League, and therefore his level of performance might be a little unpredictable. But Mahrez is still Algeria’s talisman, and his position is higher than a few other quality players because of his importance to his nation. This might be his last dance at the highest level, but it could be a big one.\n65. Emiliano Martinez (Argentina)\nAge: 33 Position: Goalkeeper\nA cheeky, why-I-oughta rapscallion to some, the devil incarnate to others, but even through gritted teeth, pretty much everyone can agree Martinez is one of the world’s best goalkeepers. He’s certainly one of the most decorated, with a World Cup, two Copas America, a couple of Yashin Trophy wins as the best goalkeeper in the game and, unofficially, the title of Football’s Biggest Scamp.\n66. Desire Doue (France)\nAge: 20 Position: Forward\nA thrilling attacker. If you were purely judging players on aesthetics, Doue would be in a much more prominent position on this list, but his ranking here suffers slightly because France have a lot of thrilling attackers. If, say, Luis Diaz was to get injured, then Colombia would suffer because they don’t have anyone of comparable quality: should Doue be stricken, the French have a queue of replacements. But that isn’t to diminish the young man’s brilliance.\nAdvertisement\n67. Bradley Barcola (France)\nAge: 23 Position: Forward\nOne-third of Europe’s most potent strike force at Paris Saint-Germain for a brief period, although the emergence of Doue means Barcola has to fight for minutes for club and country. Perhaps not fully trusted by France manager Didier Deschamps yet, but his ability isn’t in doubt.\n68. Scott McTominay (Scotland)\nAge: 28 Position: Midfielder\nHas there been a greater ‘glow up’ in recent years than McTominay blossoming from a workaday, reliable, seven-out-of-10 performer for Manchester United, to a title-winning talisman at Napoli? He performs that role for Scotland now too, as evidenced by his sensational overhead kick in the win against Denmark that confirmed their first World Cup place since 1998.\n69. Cole Palmer (England)\nAge: 23 Position: Midfielder\nThe guy may have more trademarks than Disney, but on the football pitch there’s pretty much only one Cole Palmer. One of the most joyous sights in the Premier League is watching him languidly thread a pass or nonchalantly curl one into the top corner for Chelsea. The fact he is potentially not in England’s World Cup XI speaks to their strength right now.\n70. Phil Foden (England)\nAge: 25 Position: Midfielder\nThere is a danger of Foden becoming a bit of an enigma, a supremely talented performer who doesn’t quite fulfil their potential at international level. English football history is littered with such players, but this time it’s not just suspicion of flair, it’s because there are so many other options in his best positions: to get in the team, he has to compete with Saka, Bellingham, Palmer, Morgan Rogers and others.\n71. Mohammed Kudus (Ghana)\nAge: 25 Position: Forward\nBasically, if you want someone who can dribble past a defender with a body feint and a brisk turn of pace, there are very few better than Kudus. However, if you also want someone to sporadically go missing in games, Kudus can be that guy, too. Inconsistent, but can be a world-beater.\nAdvertisement\n72. Nico Williams (Spain)\nAge: 23 Position: Forward\nThere is an instinct to compare Williams and Yamal: two incredibly talented young Spanish wingers, who operate on different flanks and thus complement each other. But that’s unfair, and while Williams perhaps doesn’t have the profile of Yamal right now, he’s still very exciting and will be one of Spain’s key threats at the World Cup.\n73. Aurelien Tchouameni (France)\nAge: 25 Position: Midfielder\nThe glue around which the Real Madrid and France midfields are built, Tchouameni combines a tactical brain with the legs of a Grand National winner and is one of those players who makes being a midfield pivot look very easy.\n74. Kai Havertz (Germany)\nAge: 26 Position: Forward\nIt feels like Havertz has been a long-term temporary solution for both club and country. Arsenal and Germany have frequently fretted about not having a genuine centre-forward and hankered after a more traditional No 9, during which time Havertz has performed admirably in the role. He’s probably more important there to his national team than his club, and hopefully his ongoing injury absence doesn’t hamper his World Cup prospects too much.\n75. Marcus Thuram (France)\nAge: 28 Position: Forward\nNot quite prolific enough to be classed as an elite striker, but Thuram’s rise from the French lower leagues to winning Serie A with Inter and playing in a World Cup and the Champions League final is a great story. A constant physical presence and offers versatility in attack.\n76. Gavi (Spain)\nAge: 21 Position: Midfielder\nIt’s inevitable that injury will deny some key players the chance to be part of this World Cup, and you fear Gavi might be one of them, given the knee problem that has restricted him to just two appearances for Barcelona this season. If he’s fit, the partnership he has with Pedri for club and country is a joy to watch, and you hope we’ll see it in full flow in the summer.\nAdvertisement\n77. Dani Olmo (Spain)\nAge: 27 Position: Forward\nNot a mainstay either in Barcelona’s team or for Spain, yet there are few better in terms of technical ability and footballing intelligence in those pockets in the final third than Olmo. Surprisingly became a key component of Spain’s Euro 2024-winning side and was named in the team of the tournament.\n78. Omar Marmoush (Egypt)\nAge: 26 Position: Forward\nThe heir apparent to Salah’s crown as Egypt’s great attacking hope, for the moment Marmoush is his primary support act. But he also complements Salah nicely, coming off the left of Egypt’s front three. Marmoush perhaps hasn’t played as well this season as he did in the previous one, but if Egypt are to improve their poor World Cup record, they will need both him and Salah on top form.\n79. Sandro Tonali (Italy)\nAge: 25 Position: Midfielder\nNot picked for Euro 2020 and suspended for Euro 2024, this will be Tonali’s first major tournament, should Italy make it. Aggressive and positive, his game has evolved in the past year to the point that he has become one of the Premier League’s most complete midfielders.\n80. Tijjani Reijnders (Netherlands)\nAge: 27 Position: Midfielder\nIt tells you plenty that even with Gravenberch and De Jong to compete with, Reijnders is still a key part of the Dutch midfield. It’s partly because of that competition that Reijnders is in a relatively modest position on this list: manager Ronald Koeman has plenty of cover in his position, but he nonetheless makes them a much better side if he is available.\n81. Antoine Semenyo (Ghana)\nAge: 25 Position: Forward\nIt’s surely a matter of when, not if, Semenyo moves to a Champions League-level club now that he’s become a big fish in a small pond. You can imagine him making an impact at just about any of the Premier League’s top sides. Sorry, Bournemouth fans. Anyway, Semenyo is just a joyful player to watch. Direct, fast, skilful. Bosh.\nAdvertisement\n82. Ousmane Diomande (Ivory Coast)\nAge: 21 Position: Defender\nInjuries have hampered Sporting CP’s Diomande fairly significantly in Portugal this season, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t a hugely promising defender and will be key if Ivory Coast are to improve on their poor record at the World Cup, having never got beyond the group stage. Watch out for Diomande as a player whose value could shoot up after the tournament.\n83. Brahim Diaz (Morocco)\nAge: 26 Position: Midfielder\nReal Madrid’s gifted attacking midfielder/winger has become a crucial component in Morocco’s attack since switching allegiances from Spain in early 2024. A regular in Madrid’s squad, if not the first XI, Diaz can turn any game with his creativity and close dribbling.\n84. Xavi Simons (Netherlands)\nAge: 22 Position: Midfielder\nSimons has had a tricky start to life at Tottenham, but he’s still one of the key creative forces for the Dutch. Their defence is strong and their midfield has plenty of No 6/No 8 options, but the quality is lighter in attack, which is where Simons is so important, either in a No 10 role or out wide.\n85. Rafael Leao (Portugal)\nAge: 26 Position: Forward\nA mercurial winger who is almost impossible to stop on his day, it’s just that ‘his day’ hasn’t quite come around frequently enough in the past. Leao has never quite nailed down a regular starting spot for Portugal, but when he and Mendes dovetail in tandem, there are few better sights in international football.\n86. Abdukodir Khusanov (Uzbekistan)\nAge: 21 Position: Defender\nThe countries experiencing the tournament for the first time are the best stories at this World Cup. Khusanov is Uzbekistan’s most prominent player and one of the most promising defenders at the tournament: his time at Manchester City has been a little stop-start so far since January’s transfer, but he comes alive with his national team.\nAdvertisement\n87. Martin Zubimendi (Spain)\nAge: 26 Position: Midfielder\nNot only an intelligent defensive midfielder who excels in breaking up play but also a facilitator for others, Zubimendi hasn’t generated as many headlines as some of his Arsenal team-mates, but he has significantly improved them in defence and attack since joining this past summer. A vital team player for club and country who is coming into his peak years.\n88. Eduardo Camavinga (France)\nAge: 23 Position: Midfielder\nIs versatility a blessing or a curse? On the one hand, it makes you very useful to a coach, and is handy for things like being called up to a tournament squad. On the other, it means you never quite establish yourself in a particular role in the team. Camavinga’s ability to play in midfield, on the left and at left-back arguably means we’ve never quite seen how good he can be.\n89. Pau Cubarsi (Spain)\nAge: 18 Position: Defender\nHas already played in six Clasicos across three La Liga seasons and won 10 senior caps for Spain, all before his 19th birthday in January. Not a typical career trajectory for a centre-back, but then Cubarsi is no ordinary player. A technical, mature defender who is calmness personified.\n90. Marc-Andre ter Stegen (Germany)\nAge: 33 Position: Goalkeeper\nConsidering Manuel Neuer was around for almost all of his international career, Ter Stegen’s total of 44 caps since a 2012 debut is actually pretty impressive. Neuer was one of several German players to retire after Euro 2024, so the gloves are now Ter Stegen’s. You hope the back injury which has prevented him playing yet this season doesn’t stop him going to his first major tournament as Germany’s No 1.\n91. Nicolas Jackson (Senegal)\nAge: 24 Position: Forward\nWith his pace, movement and agility, a confident Jackson is a striker to be feared. He tends to score prolifically when in the mood, although competing with Kane and Mane at club and international levels does limit his minutes.\nAdvertisement\n92. Estevao (Brazil)\nAge: 18 Position: Forward\nIf you think Estevao should be better placed in these rankings… well, you might be right, but while his promise is colossal, his lack of experience and the competition in his position for Brazil mean he’s in this relatively modest position. But who knows: once we get closer to the tournament, he could feature much, much earlier.\n93. Rodrygo (Brazil)\nAge: 24 Position: Forward\nBack in the Brazil fold under his former Real Madrid manager Ancelotti, having been dropped earlier this year. Rodrygo can’t nail down a place for Madrid, with a penchant for playing on the left proving problematic, but his talent is undeniable.\n94. Hugo Ekitike (France)\nAge: 23 Position: Forward\nCompetition for forward places in the France squad is obviously incredibly fierce, but Ekitike has the talent to be right up there with the best of them. The question is: can he maintain his challenge for a spot in the team if his club, Liverpool, are in such dreadful form?\n95. Aleksandar Pavlovic (Germany)\nAge: 21 Position: Midfielder\nNot yet played 100 senior matches in his career but the archetypal No 6 has a decent chance of being a mainstay of Germany’s midfield for many years to come. Missed the Euros last year due to tonsillitis, meaning this World Cup will be his first major international tournament.\n96. Dean Huijsen (Spain)\nAge: 20 Position: Defender\nHuijsen has suffered a slightly sticky start to life at Real Madrid this season, partly because of his form but now because of injury, and he might have to accept he will not start every week for Alonso, even when fit. But then you remember he was still a teenager eight months ago, and that his undoubted talent will surely see him become one of the world’s top centre-backs in the coming years.\n97. Gilberto Mora (Mexico)\nAge: 17 Position: Midfielder\nAdvertisement\nAlready being hailed as a generational talent, Mora will be a lot higher on the 2030 edition of this list if his upward career trajectory continues. A Liga MX debutant at 15, Mexico’s youngest senior player at 16 and next set to become a World Cup starlet at 17 before a surely inevitable move to Europe.\n98. Kaoru Mitoma (Japan)\nAge: 28 Position: Forward\nSurprisingly has just 29 caps for his country despite his experience (due to a combination of injuries and only moving to Europe aged 24). A consistently effective performer in the Premier League for Brighton & Hove Albion. Injury permitting, Mitoma should be one to watch in 2026 in his first World Cup as a starter.\n99. Matheus Cunha (Brazil)\nAge: 26 Position: Forward\nMost national teams have a problem position: Brazil actually have a few (their full-back options aren’t too hot), but centre-forward has been an issue for some time. Cunha could solve that, though. His ability to play through the middle as a sort of false nine/roaming reference point, surrounded by Vinicius Jr/Estevao/Raphinha /Rodrygo/whoever, could provide a solution for Ancelotti.\n100. Takefusa Kubo (Japan)\nAge: 24 Position: Forward\nA gifted Real Sociedad winger who has long been put on a pedestal as the future of Japanese football, Kubo has already been playing for the national team for six years and chipped in with three goals and eight assists in qualification. Unusually, he is formerly of Barcelona (at youth level) and Real Madrid, but is yet to take that next step at club level.",
