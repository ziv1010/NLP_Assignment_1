Leeds manager Farke has Anton Stach, Noah Okafor, Lucas Perri, Sean Longstaff, James Justin and Dominic Calvert-Lewin among the new players at his disposal.\nLeeds, though, are not done yet, with the West Yorkshire club aiming to make more signings before the summer transfer window closes on September 1.\nTwo separate sources have revealed that Leeds have made a move to sign former Tottenham and Chelsea forward Werner from RB Leipzig.\nWerner is out of contract at Leipzig at the end of the season, and the Bundesliga club are ready to cash in on him now.\nThe 29-year-old had a disappointing spell on a personal level at Chelsea before returning to Leipzig in 2022, and Tottenham did not make his loan deal permanent at the end of the 2024/25 campaign.\nAccording to Bild, Leeds and Burnley made enquiries for Werner, who could now end up watching Leipzig from the stands.\nBild reported on Wednesday: ‘Although the transfer window is still open for another six days, Werner has so far been unresponsive to any enquiries.\n‘And yet, there have been some. According to BILD information, there were even two interested Premier League clubs – Burnley FC and newly promoted Leeds United.’\nThe report added: ‘Werner also let the two-and-a-half-year offer from sister club New York Red Bulls slip away, and the MLS transfer window has been closed since August 21, meaning a move is off the table.’\nBild continued: ‘Instead of the Premier League and the Big Apple, Werner’s prospects now lie in the stands.\n‘The former DFB star is too expensive and no longer fits the bill, it is said.\n‘RB Leipzig has announced internally that they no longer want to use him.’\nAccording to a report in GiveMeSport on Thursday, Werner has turned down the chance to join Leeds in the final days of the summer transfer window.\nLeeds explored whether the £200,000-a-week German star would be interested in a move to Elland Road and got a negative response.\nAccording to the report, if Werner were to return to the Premier League, then his ‘preference’ would be to play for a club in London.\nThe 29-year-old forward, who won the Champions League with Chelsea in 2020/21 and the Europa League with Tottenham in 2024/25, could be offered to Fulham, Crystal Palace and West Ham United.\nREAD MORE ➡️ Every completed Leeds United transfer in summer 2025: Signings, exits, loans\nLeeds United trying to sign Facundo Buonanotte\nWhile Werner has shut the door on a potential move to Leeds, the Whites could be able to bring in an Argentina international star.\nAccording to journalist Ben Jacobs, Leeds are in advanced talks to sign Facundo Buonanotte on a loan deal from Brighton and Hove Albion.\nBuonanotte, who can operate as an attacking midfielder or as a winger, spent the 2024/25 campaign on loan at Leicester City from Brighton.\nThe 20-year-old Argentine star scored six goals and gave three assists in 35 appearances in the 2024/25 season.\nUnderstand Leeds United are advancing in talks to sign Facundo Bounanotte on loan from Brighton.\nEarlier in the window Leeds had feared the Argentine midfielder would move to a club with European football, but there is now fresh optimism.🇦🇷\n🤝 @alex_crook pic.twitter.com/2ajDfzB0zN\n— Ben Jacobs (@JacobsBen) August 28, 2025\nLatest Leeds news: Nigerian star on radar, Man Utd midfielder move\nTEAMtalk’s transfer insider, Darren Witcoop, has reported that Leeds are pushing hard to sign a Nigeria international striker after he failed to agree on personal terms with Wolves, with his current club ready to offload him in the final days of the summer transfer window.\nLeeds are keen on a controversial deal for a Man Utd midfielder, who has made it clear to the Old Trafford chiefs that he wants to go out on loan.\nDanny Mills has exclusively told TEAMtalk that a Leeds star should leave, with the former Elland Road star reacting to Farke’s brutal call.",
