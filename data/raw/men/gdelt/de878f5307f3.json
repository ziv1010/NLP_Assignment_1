As we have consistently reported, Arsenal’s chiefs are willing to sanction a big spend on the correct target and Vlahovic is certainly on their radar.\nREAD MORE: Arsenal legend feels ‘door is closed’ over ever making Emirates return after betrayal\nArsenal want a new world-class striker – sources\nArsenal are keeping a close eye on other striker targets, however. As previously revealed, Newcastle star Alexander Isak is their ‘dream target,’ but it would take over £100m to lure him away from St James’ Park.\nThe Gunners are also interested in RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko, Sporting CP’s Viktor Gyokeres and Eintracht Frankfurt’s Omar Marmoush.\nBut Arsenal will continue to keep a close eye on Vlahovic’s situation and sources say it is possible that they do make a move for him in January.\nArsenal currently find themselves fourth in the Premier League table, nine points behind leaders Liverpool. Havertz has netted four league goals so far – eight less than Man City man Haaland.\nVlahovic could be a superb signing for Arsenal but the North Londoners will face competition for his signature, while we can confirm that his agents are working very hard to secure him a Premier League move.\nManchester United have also been linked with the forward, while Chelsea have been previously linked with him too.\nArsenal round-up: Leroy Sane interest / Saliba to Real Madrid?\nMeanwhile, Arsenal are also on the lookout for winger targets, as the Gunners aren’t expected to make Raheem Sterling’s loan a permanent move at the end of the season.\nThe Gunners are one of the clubs who have shown interest in signing Bayern Munich star Leroy Sane, who is out of contract at the end of the season.\nManchester United are also interested in the former Manchester City man but reports suggest that he ‘didn’t like living in the area while with the Cityzens’, which could give Arsenal an advantage in the race.\n“Arsenal could then be an option for Sane, as they’re playing Champions League football – and likely to continue doing so next season. Newcastle, who have also been linked, aren’t in Europe’s top-flight and look likely to next year,” as per Christian Falk.\nIn other news, Real Madrid are reportedly considering a blockbuster swoop for Arsenal stalwart William Saliba. The LaLiga giants are keen to bring in a new centre-back to cover for Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba, who are both in their 30s, while Eder Militao is sidelined with another serious injury.\nHowever, sources have consistently told TEAMtalk that Saliba is happy at the Emirates and Arsenal are set to offer him a new, lucrative contract, with his current deal set to expire in 2027.",
