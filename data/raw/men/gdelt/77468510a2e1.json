The Portuguese is now set to join Juventus on loan after the former Premier League winners changed their stance.\nZinchenko has fallen behind Riccardo Calafiori and academy graduate Myles Lewis-Skelly in Arsenal's defensive pecking order, while Jurrien Timber is also capable of playing on the left and could shift back into the role once usual starting right-back Ben White returns to fitness.\nThe Telegraph report that Zinchenko is now Dortmund's favoured option ahead of Chilwell, who has been restricted to just one Carabao Cup appearance for Chelsea this season. West Ham United have also been linked with 28-year-old Chilwell, who Enzo Maresca has made clear can leave Stamford Bridge if a suitable offer comes in.\nDortmund are currently 10th in the Bundesliga after winning just one of their last five league games, but did reach the final of last season's Champions League. They have also qualified for the play-off round of this season's reformatted competition and could still secure one of the top-eight berths that grants automatic qualification through to the knockout stages.\nZinchenko has plenty of European experience with both Arsenal and former club Manchester City, whom he left in July 2022 for £30m in search of more regular first-team football. The Ukrainian, who is versatile and can operate in central midfield, won four Premier League titles, four Carabao Cups and one FA Cup during his time under Pep Guardiola, and started the 2021 Champions League final against Chelsea.",
