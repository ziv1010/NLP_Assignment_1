It’s flattering. I appreciate it. As we say every year, we’ll see what the future has in store for us.”\nIt just remains to be seen where United and Ratcliffe decide they need to focus their attention more in the summer.\nA new centre-back will almost definitely be required, with doubts over the futures of Harry Maguire, Raphael Varane, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans.\nCentral midfield is another area in need of a revamp, with Christian Eriksen being tipped for a summer exit while veteran Brazilian Casemiro could also follow the Dane out the Old Trafford exit door.\nVILLA TO RIVAL MAN UTD FOR DUMFRIES\nAston Villa have joined Manchester United in the race to sign Inter Milan attacking right-back Denzel Dumfries.
