  "body_text": "After a new-look first phase in this season’s Champions League that took some getting used to, we were all back on familiar ground on Tuesday as this year’s first knockout ties reached dramatic conclusions in their second legs.\nFour matches, 14 goals, comebacks, late drama, a humiliating red card and a comically bad — and very costly — dive made it a memorable evening.\nAdvertisement\nFor Bayern Munich, the drama was very nearly too late, as they saw off visitors Celtic with just seconds to spare, while in Italy there were surprise exits from European football for this season by two Serie A sides.\nHere are all the major talking points from tonight's action.\nThe dive that destroyed Milan's Champions League chances\nYour team are 1-0 up in a crucial Champions League knockout tie which is delicately poised at 1-1 on aggregate early in the second half of the second leg. Your inexperienced opponents have been on the ropes for most of the match. You've got them exactly where you want them, you just need to stick to the plan and avoid doing anything daft.\nSo, what's absolutely the last thing you want to do in this situation? Getting yourself sent off and handing an instant advantage to the opposition would be right up there, yeah?\nOK, so Milan's Theo Hernandez saw red against Feyenoord, but maybe he was provoked, perhaps it was a cruel injustice?\nNope.\nThe Frenchman, already booked in the first half at San Siro, pathetically threw himself to the floor in a needlessly desperate bid to win a penalty — and Polish referee Szymon Marciniak saw right through it. An easy decision, a second yellow and so a red card, despite a \"Who, me?\" act from Hernandez.\nForty-four minutes later, Milan were out of the Champions League. Oh, Theo.\nVideo for UK readers\nTheo Hernandez sees a second yellow and is sent off for simulation 🟥\nMilan are down to 10-men 😳\n📺 @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/H2pU1r8WQt\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) February 18, 2025\nVideo for U.S. readers\nMILAN DOWN TO 10 MEN! 😱\nTheo Hernández picks up a second yellow for simulation. Right call? 🟥 pic.twitter.com/KgzfuDa1Ne\n— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) February 18, 2025\nNo manager, no problem for Feyenoord\nMake no mistake, this was a catastrophic defeat all of Milan's own making, although for the neutral it was a thrilling tie, jam-packed full of narratives, such as…\n- Santiago Gimenez, who Milan signed from Feyenoord for a reported £25million ($31m) nine days before the first leg in the Netherlands, opened the scoring after just 37 seconds, making it 1-1 on aggregate, but was soon dumped out of the competition by his former team-mates.\n- Gimenez actually became the first player in Champions League history to score for and against the same club in the same season (excluding own goals).\n- An ex-MLS player scored the decisive goal against American-owned Milan, with former Philadelphia Union forward Julian Carranza heading home on 73 minutes to make it 1-1 on the night and 2-1 on aggregate.\n- Milan missed out on a possible last-16 derby against neighbours Inter (Feyenoord will now be paired with either Inter or Arsenal in Friday's draw).\n- And Feyenoord haven't even got a manager right now: they sacked Arne Slot's summer successor Brian Priske two days before the first leg.\nInterim boss Pascal Bosschaart oversaw a near-miraculous result at San Siro (which was also the scene of Feyenoord's greatest-ever triumph, as they won their only European Cup — as the Champions League was then known — there in 1970).\nAdvertisement\nFine, Milan are struggling at just seventh in Serie A, but Feyenoord are fourth in the weaker Eredivisie and were missing not one, not two, but 10 players through injury or suspension, a figure which might be enough for even Ange Postecoglou to exclaim, \"Strewth, mate. That's pretty rough.”\nWithout the likes of experienced defender Gernot Trauner, Japanese striker Ayase Ueda and captain Quinten Timber, the average age of Feyenoord's XI was under 23 years old, with three Dutch teenagers in the line-up. They weathered Milan's early storm, when Sergio Conceicao's side spurned a host of chances, and then the dynamics of the whole match changed after Hernandez's red on 51 minutes.\nConceicao withdrew USMNT forward Christian Pulisic (whose cross had led to the opening goal), and then Gimenez was also taken off but, with Chelsea loanee Joao Felix playing as a false nine in a 4-4-1 formation, but Milan could get absolutely nothing going. Feyenoord grew in confidence and sparked wild scenes on their bench and in a rowdy away section when Wolves loanee Hugo Bueno swung a perfect cross onto Carranza's head for the tie's decisive goal.\nVideo for UK readers\nPinpoint precision 🎯\nFeyenoord re-take the aggregate lead through substitute Julian Carranza after a brilliant cross 🙌\n📺 @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/A38GSeTx2Q\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) February 18, 2025\nVideo for U.S. readers\nJULIÁN CARRANZA STUNS THE SAN SIRO! 😳\nThe former Philadelphia Union and Inter Miami forward pops up with a massive strike for Feyenoord 💥 pic.twitter.com/5CMGnUC8FE\n— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) February 18, 2025\nYou wouldn't have seen many predictions saying Feyenoord would be in the last 16 after they were hammered 6-1 by Lille on the final matchday of the league phase last month but although they remain tournament outsiders, teams would be wise not to underestimate them.\nJust ask Milan.\nAdvertisement\nCanada's Davies helps Bayern bundle their way past Celtic\nYou also wouldn't have seen many predictions that had Celtic 1-0 up away at Bayern Munich deep into stoppage time at the end of the second half, but that's exactly what happened at the Allianz Arena, only for Alphonso Davies to send the home side through moments away from the tie going to 30 minutes of extra time.\nYou can only imagine the recriminations for manager Vincent Kompany had they thrown away their 2-1 advantage from Celtic Park last week.\nBayern's home record in the Champions League is strong: in the past 10 years they have only lost to Real Madrid, Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain on their own pitch. Conversely, Celtic's away record in the Champions League is hopeless. In 43 games in the competition proper, they have lost 35, drawn six and won only twice (at Anderlecht and Spartak Moscow).\nAnd yet Brendan Rodgers' team were terrific tonight in Munich, restricting the goal-shy hosts (who failed to muster a shot on target when drawing 0-0 at Bayer Leverkusen at the weekend) and then taking a shock lead when former Bayern B-team player Nicolas Kuhn took advantage of hesitant defending to beat goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.\nCeltic defended stoically thereafter and looked to be taking Bayern to extra time, only for Canada international Davies to block USMNT defender Cameron Carter-Vickers' attempted clearance over the line from close range with just 47 seconds remaining.\nVideo for UK readers\nALPHONSO DAVIES PUTS BAYERN AHEAD IN THE FINAL MINUTES 🤯\nKasper Schmeichel's excellent save isn't enough to stop the Canadian latching onto the rebound to take the lead in the tie 🙌#UCLonPrime pic.twitter.com/GLe69Sg9Tb\n— Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) February 18, 2025\nVideo for U.S. readers\nBAYERN MUNICH AND CANADA'S ALPHONSO DAVIES BREAK CELTIC'S HEART RIGHT AT THE DEATH 🤯 pic.twitter.com/5LZCeI3C8c\n— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) February 18, 2025\nIt was so tough on Celtic, and it still remained a thoroughly underwhelming night for Kompany's vulnerable Bayern, who saw striker Harry Kane withdrawn at half-time as a precaution with a calf injury.\nThere's losing a football match with dignity… and then there's Rafael Toloi.\nGranted, it had been a horrible night for his Atalanta side, who will have expected to have overturned Club Brugge's controversial 2-1 advantage from the first leg (the Belgians were given a penalty softer than melted butter on a warm waffle) but instead found themselves 3-0 down at half-time on the night, so 5-1 on aggregate, in the return.\nWith the minutes counting down, their captain Toloi lost his head.\nAdvertisement\nBasically, the visitors' defender Maxim De Cuyper stopped him from taking a throw-in. Toloi then tried to throw the ball at De Cuyper… missed… fell over, tried to pick the ball up, failed, then crashed into De Cuyper and was sent off.\nIt was Laurel and Hardy, Bumblebee Man from The Simpsons and Frank Spencer rolled into one.\nYou are advised to watch what follows through your fingers.\nVideo for UK readers\nAtalanta captain Rafael Tolói completely loses his head and receives a red card as a consequence 🟥\n📺 @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/KHvMRZhVuK\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) February 18, 2025\nVideo for U.S. readers\nAtalanta captain Rafael Tolói lost his head — this is WILD 😭 pic.twitter.com/omZaBVwyLY\n— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) February 18, 2025\nA truly embarrassing way to go\nWhile we had a shock in Milan and almost a huge surprise in Munich, Atalanta's heavy defeat in Bergamo was probably the night's biggest turn-up for the books.\nDespite enduring a bad run of form in recent weeks (one win in six in all competitions, coinciding with the absence through injury of talisman Ademola Lookman), Gian Piero Gasperini's 2023-24 Europa League winners will have fancied their chances of making the round of 16.\nInstead, Club Brugge effectively ended the tie with a blistering first-half performance, capped by this stunning strike from former Barcelona forward Ferran Jutgla, which came just seconds after Davide Zappacosta and Juan Cuadrado had both hit the post for Atalanta.\nVideo for UK readers\nFerran Jutglà, what a strike 🚀\nAn incredible sequence of events sees Club Brugge score a third, moments after Atalanta see an effort cleared off the line!\n📺 @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/t7HmWHczhE\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) February 18, 2025\nVideo for U.S. readers\nSIMPLY STUNNING STRIKE IN BERGAMO! 🚀\nYou can't hit them much better than Ferran Jutglà did for Club Brugge 🤩 pic.twitter.com/6emlAl9Ea4\n— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) February 18, 2025\nLookman made his return at half-time and scored just 34 seconds later to give the Italian side hope but when he later saw a penalty saved by former Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, Atalanta knew it wasn't their night.\nAdvertisement\nThey became the second Italian side to bow out of the competition in a matter of minutes and the third of their five qualifiers to go already this season, with Bologna having exited after the league phase having won just one of their eight matches. Juventus will hope to avoid becoming Serie A's fourth casualties, leaving only Inter standing, when they take a 2-1 aggregate lead to Dutch champions PSV tomorrow.\nAre you not entertained?\nIf it's fun and goals you want in the Champions League, look no further than Benfica.\nBruno Lage's team had beaten Monaco 3-2 in the league phase (coming from 1-0 and 2-1 down to do so) and then were involved in perhaps the match of the 2024-25 tournament so far when somehow losing 5-4 at home to Barcelona having been 4-2 up with 13 minutes of the 90 to go.\nWe should have known to expect goals galore as they faced Monaco for the third time in this season's competition — especially as the Ligue 1 visitors had found their shooting boots with a 7-1 victory over Nantes at the weekend — and the two teams didn't disappoint, playing out a 3-3 draw which saw Benfica squeak through 4-3 on aggregate.\nMonaco thought they had taken the tie to extra time when substitute George Ilenikhena put them up 3-2 on the night with nine minutes left, but after only two of those nine minutes, Orkun Kokcu diverted Alvaro Fernandez's cross past goalkeeper Radoslaw Majecki.\nThe Lisbon side will now face either Liverpool or a rematch with Barcelona in the round of 16.\nVideo for UK readers\nWhat a match this has been 🔥\nBenfica fire back with another goal and that could be the tie wrapped up 🫣\n📺 @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/nD1jiG9uNJ\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) February 18, 2025\nVideo for U.S. readers\n22': Benfica 1-0 Monaco (Agg 2-0)\n32': Benfica 1-1 Monaco (Agg 2-1)\n51': Benfica 1-2 Monaco (Agg 2-2)\n76': Benfica 2-2 Monaco (Agg 3-2)\n81': Benfica 2-3 Monaco (Agg 3-3)\n84': Benfica 3-3 Monaco (Agg 4-3)THIS GAME 🤯 pic.twitter.com/WuUvAx2HUJ\n— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) February 18, 2025\nTuesday's results\nMilan 1 Feyenoord 1 (1-2 on aggregate)\nAtalanta 1 Club Brugge 3 (2-5 on aggregate)\nBayern Munich 1 Celtic 1 (3-2 on aggregate)\nBenfica 3 Monaco 3 (4-3 on aggregate)\nAdvertisement\nWhat's next?\nThe four remaining play-off second legs are tomorrow (Wednesday):\nBorussia Dortmund (3) vs Sporting CP (0), 5.45pm GMT/12.45pm ET\nParis Saint-Germain (3) vs Brest (0), 8pm GMT/3pm ET\nPSV (1) vs Juventus (2), 8pm GMT/3pm ET\nReal Madrid (3) vs Manchester City (2), 8pm GMT/3pm ET\nThe four winners will advance to the last 16 next month, joining seeded sides Liverpool, Barcelona, Arsenal, Inter, Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen, Lille and Aston Villa and non-seeds Feyenoord, Brugge, Bayern and Benfica.\nThe draws for that round, the quarter-final and semi-finals will all take place this Friday.\n(Top photo: Markus Gilliar - GES Sportfoto/Getty Images)",
