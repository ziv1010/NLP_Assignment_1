Of course, I would like Pedro Neto, but of course, he is playing in a different reality, much different from ours, especially financially.\n“What can I say? I can wish him the very best, injury-free career. And of course I thank him for his words as well.”\nMeanwhile, Neto had, during his pre-match press conference, hailed Mourinho as the manager who allowed Portuguese players to go play football around the world.\nThe 25-year-old also said it would be a privilege for him to play under Mourinho.",
