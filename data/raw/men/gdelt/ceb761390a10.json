Warren Gatland's side are dangerously close to picking up the wooden spoon and are the only side to have lost three out of three, while les Bleus have won just once thus far.\nWales vs France in the Six Nations 2024 is airing for free in the U.K. today, on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. Don't worry if you're abroad right now, because you can watch Wales vs France live streams from anywhere with a VPN.\nWarren Gatland has changed both centers for this game, with Joe Roberts and Owen Watkin in for Nick Tompkins and George North, who both drop out of the squad entirely. Will Rowlands and Adam Beard make up the second row, so captain Dafydd Jenkins will pack down at blindside flanker, an unfamiliar position for the youngster. Sam Costelow keeps his place at fly-half, with Josh Adams and Rio Dyer on the wings.\nFabien Galthie, meanwhile has rung the changes for France, with eight new faces in the starting XV. Captain Gregory Alldritt returns at number eight, Julian Marchand starts at hooker and new second rows Thibaud Flament and Emmanuel Meafou are in with François Cros moving to flanker. Mathieu Jalibert misses out completely, with Thomas Ramos moving to fly-half and Leo Barre coming in at full-back.\nWales: Cameron Winnett; Josh Adams, Joe Roberts, Owen Watkin, Rio Dyer; Sam Costelow, Tomos Williams; Gareth Thomas, Ryan Elias, Keiron Assiratti, Will Rowlands, Adam Beard, Dafydd Jenkins, Tommy Reffell, Aaron Wainwright.\nFrance: Leo Barre; Damian Penaud, Gael Fickou, Nicolas Depoortere, Louis Bielle-Biarrey; Thomas Ramos, Nolann Le Garrec; Cyril Baille, Julian Marchand, Uini Atonio, Thibaud Flament, Emmanuel Meafou, François Cros, Charles Ollivon, Gregory Alldritt.\nTelevision coverage is now underway from Cardiff, where conditions are looking pretty wet outside but with the Millennium Stadium roof expected to be closed for this one, that shouldn’t be a problem. The atmosphere is building nicely in the Welsh capital and there should be a great noise greeting the teams at kick-off, which is coming soon.\nQuick links\n► Time: 3 pm UK / 10 am ET / 7 am PT / 2 am AEDT (Mar. 11)\nUS: Peacock\nUK: BBC One | BBC iPlayer (free with license fee)\nIRE: RTE 2 | RTE Player (free)\nAUS: Stan Sport\nHow to use a VPN to watch any stream\nWales came into the Six Nations 2024 hoping that a new era under young captain Dafydd Jenkins could provide some uplift to performances but three defeats from three is a tough return, even if a 31-7 last weekend to in-form Ireland is no disgrace. Coach Gatland has tried to freshen things up with Jenkins moving to blindside flanker, with the experienced center George North dropped to the bench despite putting in decent showings against England and Ireland. The Welsh haven't finished with the wooden spoon since 2003 but another defeat leaves that looking increasingly likely.\nFrance beat Italy 60-7 at the World Cup last fall but could only limp to a 13-13 draw with the same opposition two weeks ago. Sure, les Bleus played the whole second half with 14 men after Jonathan Danty's red card but only Paolo Garbisi's missed injury-time penalty prevented a first home defeat to the Azzurri. Fabien Galthie's side have had some hangover since the heartbreaking World Cup quarter-final defeat to South Africa and miss Olympics-bound captain Antoine Dupont but were lucky to beat Scotland – their sole Six Nations victory thus far – thanks to a controversial late refereeing decision.\nWho will pick up a necessary win?
