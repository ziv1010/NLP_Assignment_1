  "body_text": "Loyalty in modern football is always said to be a rare thing, but Hugo Lloris’ commitment to Tottenham Hotspur has never wavered during a hugely eventful 11 years at the club.\nA World Cup-winning captain and consistently one of the Premier League’s best goalkeepers for a decade, Lloris was never seriously tempted to move away — not when Manchester United wanted him to replace the seemingly Real Madrid-bound David de Gea in 2015, nor when Roma came calling in 2021. Most of the time teams didn’t even bother, knowing Lloris had no intention of leaving the club he has captained for the past seven years.\nAdvertisement\nWhat a shame it would be then if being taken off injured at half-time of the 6-1 battering at Newcastle United last month does turn out to be his last Spurs appearance. But that could be the reality after it was confirmed on Friday the thigh injury Lloris picked up at St James’ Park will keep him out for the remainder of this season, with the expectation being that he could well leave in the summer.\nLloris is 36, still has a year left on his contract and his preference is to stay, but whoever ends up being named Tottenham’s new head coach is likely to want someone younger and better with the ball at his feet in goal. And though Spurs would like to keep Lloris for his leadership, experience and proven abilities, even if he is their No 2, it’s not an arrangement that would particularly appeal to Lloris himself.\nThose close to Lloris remember him hating the brief periods in his career when he wasn’t the No 1, like at the start of his France career as a youngster deputising for Steve Mandanda. When Tottenham beat neighbours Arsenal to his signature in the summer of 2012, he was initially second choice to Brad Friedel and the American told The Athletic a couple of years ago how frustrated Lloris was with that arrangement.\nIt only took a few months for Lloris to usurp Friedel and since then he has never been replaced. There have been low moments and fans have been angered at times by errors he has made, but he has generally been a model of consistency. And his quiet, understated leadership has been invaluable at a time of huge churn and evolution at the club.\nAnd so if today’s injury news really does signify the end of his Spurs career, what will Lloris’ legacy be?\nAside from Harry Kane, he will surely go down as Tottenham’s most important player of the past decade. He is their record Premier League appearance-maker with 361 and is a symbol of their journey from upstart to part of the establishment. Spurs had two top-four finishes in the 20 Premier League seasons prior to his arrival; they have had five in the 10 completed seasons since.\nAdvertisement\nLloris arrived just after the departure of Harry Redknapp — another symbolic moment perhaps of when the feel of the club started to shift — and has been managed by Andre Villas-Boas, Tim Sherwood, Pochettino, Jose Mourinho, Mason (who was a late substitute in the game where Lloris made his Spurs debut), Nuno Espirito Santo, Antonio Conte, Stellini and now Mason again. It’s quite a spread and underlines Lloris’ durability.\nIf he does go this summer, it will mean one of the last links to the Pochettino side has gone. Only Kane and Son Heung-min (and Harry Winks if he is reintegrated by the new boss after spending this season on loan to Italy’s Sampdoria) would be left of the side that started the Champions League final against Liverpool four years ago next month.\nLosing that particular match is one of Lloris’ biggest regrets from his time at Spurs, along with the 2014-15 Carabao Cup final defeat to Chelsea and missing out on the title a year later (that one really hurt him). But the role Lloris played in getting Spurs to Madrid in the first place should also be among his biggest sources of pride: the heroics in the last-16 second leg away to Borussia Dortmund, the penalty save against Sergio Aguero in the quarter-final first leg, and a similarly important stop to deny Kevin De Bruyne in the return at the Etihad Stadium.\nLloris has generally greatly enjoyed his 11 years at Spurs, but the Pochettino era was his favourite period. He loved the team spirit and particularly the way the manager was so demanding of the players every day.\nHis disillusionment when the team’s standards started to drop under Mourinho was writ large when he eviscerated what Tottenham had become in a brutally honest interview after an embarrassing “disgrace” of a Europa League exit away to Dinamo Zagreb two years ago, having won the home leg 2-0.\nAdvertisement\nLloris could always be relied upon to deliver home truths when required and if there’s anything fitting about the Newcastle defeat being potentially his final appearance for the club, it’s that he fronted up and spoke to the media afterwards — despite being injured. “It’s very embarrassing. We should apologise to the fans,” he said. “It is not even about tactics; we just could not fight. There was a lack of pride.”\nThere’s no denying this season has been harder for Lloris, who has looked shaky on several occasions. As the goalkeeper position has evolved and more emphasis is placed on them being comfortable playing the ball, Lloris has gone from being perceived as a modern sweeper-keeper in 2012 to looking like an anachronism. But before these difficult last few months, he was extremely consistent for nearly three years after returning from a serious elbow injury in January 2020, even during some pretty low moments for the team.\nWhen Lloris broke his Premier League appearance record for Spurs two years ago, Darren Anderton told The Athletic the Frenchman was “so underrated it’s frightening”. That was a sentiment often felt at Tottenham — that he didn’t quite get the credit he deserved. The club’s goalkeeping coaches found it strange Lloris was consistently overlooked in the Professional Footballers’ Association’s team of the season voting.\nMaybe it will only be after he leaves that he is fully appreciated and that the shaky moments will be largely forgotten and the memories of his spectacular saves — like a still genuinely unbelievable one against Bayer Leverkusen in 2016 — will be the ones that endure.\n⏪ #TBT to this Hugo Lloris save 😱😱😱#UCL | #ThrowbackThursday | @SpursOfficial pic.twitter.com/XTellLesRL\n— UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) March 26, 2020\nUnlike with France, for whom he earned a record 145 caps before retiring from international football in January after helping them to back-to-back World Cup finals, if Lloris leaves this summer he would do so having never won a trophy with Spurs. It will always be a regret for him, but that fact should not define his time at the club.\nNor should these past few months; Lloris’ 10 appearances this calendar year have included a humbling 2-0 home defeat to Arsenal, a second-half collapse from two goals up to lose 4-2 away to Manchester City and that five-goals-in-19-minutes horror show of a first half in Newcastle (not to mention other home losses to Aston Villa and Bournemouth), games in which he has made high-profile errors.\nThe leadership, the loyalty, the love — those are the things we should remember if this summer really is the end for Lloris and Spurs.\n(Top photo: Julian Finney/Getty Images)",
