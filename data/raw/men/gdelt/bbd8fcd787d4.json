  "body_text": "Part of the joy (or stress) of sports is that anything can happen between the whistles. Do favorites usually come out on top? Sure, but we've all seen plenty of upsets. That's especially true in a tournament; it seems like there's always at least one underdog that makes a fairy tale run.\nAnd with this year's expanded FIFA Club World Cup field, there are bound to be plenty of opportunities for an upset. Most fans have probably heard of clubs like PSG, Real Madrid and Manchester City, but how do you assess a matchup between the likes of Wydad AC and Al Ain FC?\nWith that in mind, let's take a look every club's odds (per FanDuel) of winning the entire tournament. Just remember that these were from before play kicked off, and a single result can turn everything upside down.\nWho Will Play in the Club World Cup 2025?\nIn previous years, the Club World Cup was a relatively small affair featuring the champions of each confederation's tournament plus a host representative. This time around, though, the field was expanded to 32 teams.\nSo who's in the competition? The full list is:\n- SE Palmeiras (BRA)\n- FC Porto (POR)\n- Al Ahly FC (EGY)\n- Inter Miami CF (USA)\n- Paris Saint-Germain (FRA)\n- Atlético de Madrid (ESP)\n- Botafogo (BRA)\n- Seattle Sounders FC (USA)\n- FC Bayern München (GER)\n- Auckland City FC (NZL)\n- CA Boca Juniors (ARG)\n- SL Benfica (POR)\n- CR Flamengo (BRA)\n- Espérance Sportive de Tunis (TUN)\n- Chelsea FC (ENG)\n- Los Angeles Football Club (USA)\n- CA River Plate (ARG)\n- Urawa Red Diamonds (JPN)\n- CF Monterrey (MEX)\n- FC Internazionale Milano (ITA)\n- Fluminense FC (BRA)\n- Borussia Dortmund (GER)\n- Ulsan HD (KOR)\n- Mamelodi Sundowns FC (RSA)\n- Manchester City (ENG)\n- Wydad AC (MOR)\n- Al Ain FC (UAE)\n- Juventus FC (ITA)\n- Real Madrid C. F. (ESP)\n- Al Hilal Saudi FC (KSA)\n- CF Pachuca (MEX)\n- FC Salzburg (AUT)\nWhen Is FIFA Club World Cup 2025?\nSince we're working with a bigger tournament field, this year's event will logically need to include more games. So, when will those take place?\nGroup play kicks off on Saturday June 14, when Lionel Messi's Inter Miami takes on Al Ahly. Things will proceed for just under two weeks, and the Round of 16 will start on Saturday, June 28.\nAfter four match days, the quarterfinals will take place on July 4 and 5. The semifinal showdowns are on July 8 and 9.\nThe tournament will then wrap up on Sunday, July 13 when the two final teams take the pitch in New Jersey.\nGroup A Betting Odds\n- SE Palmeiras: 31-1\n- FC Porto: 38-1\n- Al Ahly FC: 100-1\n- Inter Miami CF: 60-1\nWhile Lionel Messi's Inter Miami will probably command plenty of eyeballs, it's not the favorite from within this group. That distinction goes to Brazil's Palmeiras, although Porto (Portugal) has a similar chance of lifting the trophy in the oddsmakers' eyes.\nGroup B Betting Odds\n- Paris Saint-Germain: 4.7-1\n- Atlético de Madrid: 15-1\n- Botafogo: 47-1\n- Seattle Sounders FC: 90-1\nAs the reigning UEFA Champions League winners, PSG understandably comes into this tournament as one of the favorites. They have the second-best odds overall. Atletico Madrid isn't a slouch, though, starting the tournament as the sixth-favorite squad.\nGroup C Betting Odds\n- FC Bayern München: 7-1\n- Auckland City FC: 1000-1\n- CA Boca Juniors: 38-1\n- SL Benfica: 38-1\nIn soccer, the size of your wage bill generally determines your success, and that reality shows up here as Bayern Munich towers over the competition. Benfica and Boca Juniors both have respectable odds, but they're in a different class from the German giant.\nGroup D Betting Odds\n- CR Flamengo: 31-1\n- Espérance Sportive de Tunis: 370-1\n- Chelsea FC: 10-1\n- Los Angeles Football Club: 75-1\nChelsea didn't have a perfect season, but they still finished in England's Champions League places and won the UEFA Conference League. Critics will say they did that by beating up on weaker competition, but they're one of the stronger squads in the Club World Cup, at least on paper.\nGroup E Betting Odds\n- CA River Plate: 38-1\n- Urawa Red Diamonds: 170-1\n- CF Monterrey: 170-1\n- FC Internazionale Milano: 17-1\nInter may have stumbled down the stretch in both their domestic league and the Champions League, but it's still the strongest team in their group. This will also be an early chance to see how Cristian Chivu, who's replacing Simone Inzaghi on the bench, will run things.\nGroup F Betting Odds\n- Fluminense FC: 47-1\n- Borussia Dortmund: 26-1\n- Ulsan HD: 150-1\n- Mamelodi Sundowns FC: 370-1\nDortmund is the beneficiary of a weak group, at least on paper. They probably won't win it all, but dealing with these three opponents shouldn't be too stern of a test.\nGroup G Betting Odds\n- Manchester City: 5-1\n- Wydad AC: 370-1\n- Al Ain FC: 150-1\n- Juventus FC: 26-1\nDespite a down year, Manchester City towers over the Club World Cup as the third-favorite to win it all. If the newest additions—Rayan Aït-Nouri, Rayan Cherki and Tijjani Reijnders—hit the ground running, there's no reason to think City won't push toward the final.\nGroup H Betting Odds\n- Real Madrid C. F.: 4.1-1\n- Al Hilal: 60-1\n- CF Pachuca: 110-1\n- FC Salzburg: 75-1\nWhile Real Madrid might have struggled on the European stage (at least by the club's lofty standards), it's impossible to argue with the attacking talent on their roster. Do Kylian Mbappé, Vinicius Jr. and Rodrygo fit together perfectly as a front three? No, but they should be able to overpower weaker opposition.",
