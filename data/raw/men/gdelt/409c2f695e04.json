  "body_text": "Liverpool are, at present, 6 points clear at the top of the Premier League table. They are also at the top of the Champions League table’s league play phase, with only two more matches remaining. They’re also alive in the League and FA cups, respectively. Which is to say, Liverpool are challenging on all front and, by most measures, are at or near the top of any list of clubs across the whole of Europe.\nThomas Frank: Liverpool “Probably Best Team in the World”\nAfter Liverpool’s stunning 2-nil win, the Brentford manager had nothing but praise for the Reds.\nAfter enduring over 90 minutes of football where it looked like his side might manage to hold Liverpool at bay only to lose after a pair of whirlwind goals from Darwin Nuñez, Thomas Frank was incredibly complementary towards Liverpool. First in the mixed zone and then again in post-match press conference, Frank bluntly indicated that he felt Liverpool were “probably the best team in the world” and that he was proud of how his team stood up to a side of this quality.\nIt isn’t hard to understand why Frank might be inclined to say this - besides, of course, deflecting from his side being unable to see the game through - given where Liverpool stand across the respective competitions they are involved in. And given that Liverpool would have felt let down with just a draw - especially after dropping 37 shots in the match - the story of the match was that Liverpool absolutely dominated.\nBut the truth is that Liverpool are, on balance, at least on the short list for best team in Europe and, indeed, the world. And to be fair to Frank and the Bees, there’s definitely no need for deflection given how well Brentford acquitted themselves: committed and industrious on defense and absolutely willing to launch attackers forward in an attempt to catch Liverpool flatfooted on the counter.\nIt seems as though that, finally, the rest of the footballing world are coming to believe what we’ve known for some time: this Liverpool team are quite special. Here’s hoping we can, to channel the old gaffer, turn a few more folks from doubters to believers.",
