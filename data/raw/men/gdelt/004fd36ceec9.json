When I saw him against Newcastle , I said, ‘Wow!’... He’s like a combination of Xavi and Iniesta . We’re not just talking about his feet, but above all his football intelligence. Sometimes he finds himself in difficult situations, and the way he overcomes them with a little one-two or a shoulder feint is incredible. His technique is brilliant,” he said.\n”The best thing was that when Newcastle scored, there were eight minutes of stoppage time left. I thought it was going to be exciting... But Pedri had the ball for seven of the eight minutes. He took complete control of the game. I thought it was brilliant.”\nHansi Flick was asked about Scholes’s comments at his pre-match press conference and was happy to hear his opinion. He told reporters: “When you’re an attacker, you have more focus. If Scholes says that , that he was a wonderful player, it’s a good thing. Pedri is at an incredible level, as is Frenkie. I’m very happy with what I see in training.”",
