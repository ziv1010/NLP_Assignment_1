  "body_text": "There was always going to be a chance that Tosin Adarabioyo moved on from Fulham this summer, so it was no real surprise when he was announced as a new Chelsea player.\nThe way in which football has evolved means that players and their agents have clawed back some of the power in terms of negotiation tactics, given that anyone with a year or less on their contracts can determine what happens next.\nUltimately, clubs can still decide to sell players of course, however, if they prefer that those players stay put, then arguably they need to match any figures that the player might be capable of acquiring by moving elsewhere.\nFulham want to sign Silas\nWith Tosin available on a free transfer because Fulham were never going to be able to compete financially, Chelsea were the beneficiaries, and with no transfer fee to pay either, the Blues have been able to offer the 26-year-old a significant uplift on the £40,000 p/w wages (Capology) he received from the Cottagers.\nAccording to talkSPORT, he even turned down £100,000 per week from Newcastle, so the expectation is that he’s getting more from the Blues.\nWith Tosin no longer Fulham’s concern, they have been concentrating on securing other signings to strengthen the squad and according to CaughtOffside sources, Bundesliga outfit, Stuttgart, have rejected Fulham’s €8m bid for 25-year-old Congolese attacker, Silas Katompa Mvumpa, known simply as Silas.\nFulham are planning to make a new offer for the player and it’s expected to be around the €15m mark – almost double their opening gambit.\nThe West Londoners will, in the meantime, continue to hold talks with alternative names as it’s understood that the Congolese won’t prioritise leaving Stuttgart due to the fact that they will play in the Champions League next season.\nIf a good offer arrives, however, his opinion may change.\nFulham are also preparing to renegotiate the transfer of Chelsea’s 24-year-old centre-back, Trevoh Chalobah, with the first offer for the player – a direct replacement for Tosin – expected to be on loan.",
