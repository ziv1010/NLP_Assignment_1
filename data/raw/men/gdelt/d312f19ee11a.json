The generational divide running through national life is highlighted again today by our latest Essential poll, which shows older Australians are much more pessimistic about the chances of stopping the climate crisis. And a poll of attitudes at the federal election reveals that Peter Dutton’s stance on tax cuts squandered 40 years of Coalition advantage on economic management.\nWe also have details on a trial to reintroduce small marsupials almost wiped out by feral cats, a pay equality fight at the ATO, and whether there are any health benefits to drinking a fabric dye boosted by online influencers.\nAustralia\n-\nElection fallout | Voters at the federal election backed Labor as the best party to manage the economy – but the latest instalment of the Australian Electoral Study also showed Peter Dutton was the least popular major party leader since the study began in 1987.\n-\nExclusive | Twice as many older Australians as young adults believe the world cannot do anything to prevent the worst effects of our rapidly heating climate, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll.

In Romania, Nato jets were scrambled to track two Russian drones that entered the country’s airspace. South African police are investigating allegations that a daughter of former president Jacob Zuma tricked men into fighting for Russia in Ukraine by telling them they were travelling to Russia for paramilitary training.\n-\nGaza ‘abyss’ | Israel’s war in Gaza has created a “human-made abyss”, and reconstruction is likely to cost more than US$70bn over several decades. The United Nations also said at least 127 civilians have been killed in Israeli attacks on Lebanon since a ceasefire was declared nearly a year ago.\n-\nDiva done | A would-be food influencer known online as the “dine-and-dash diva” has been jailed in Brooklyn after multiple previous arrests for allegedly doing a runner at high-end restaurants.\n-\nFive ages of the brain | Scientists have identified five major “epochs” of human brain development in one of the most comprehensive studies to date of how neural wiring changes from infancy to old age.\nFull Story\nIs Lebanon the new flashpoint for Israel?\nBeirut-based journalist William Christou speaks to Nour Haydar about the Lebanese government and Hezbollah’s responses to Israel’s latest strikes in Beirut and the IDF’s ongoing presence in southern Lebanon, despite a ceasefire agreement.\nIn-depth\nIn the tough, unforgiving desert scrub of north-western New South Wales, scientists are seeing a plan to save Australia’s small marsupial species from feral cats bear fruit.

They are taking back the desert,” one scientist says.\nNot the news\nTaking methylene blue, a synthetic textile dye, for its alleged health benefits has gained popularity in wellness circles. But while influencers claim it increases energy levels, has anti-ageing effects, relieves stress and has antioxidant effects, what does the science say? Donna Lu investigates.\nSport\n-\nCricket | England’s shattered batters head to Brisbane for the second Test knowing that Mitchell Starc has their number in a way not seen since Glenn McGrath had a hold over Mike Atherton. They’ve also been warned that wickets “fall in clumps” in Tests under the lights at the Gabba.\n-\nFootball | Chelsea are at home to Barcelona in the pick of this morning’s Champions League ties, while Manchester City host Leverkusen, Newcastle travel to Marseille, and two former winners Ajax and Benfica meet in Amsterdam.
