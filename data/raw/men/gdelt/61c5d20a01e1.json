  "body_text": "Emmanuel Petit wishes Arsenal had signed Bryan Mbeumo last summer and says the Manchester United star would have helped the Gunners become Premier League champions.\nMbeumo, who joined United in a £65m move from Brentford, played a significant role in Sunday’s impressive 3-2 victory over Arsenal.\nThe Cameroon international also starred in United’s derby win over Manchester City last weekend, with his two recent goals taking his overall tally for the Red Devils to nine from 19 games.\nMbeumo was regularly hailed as Manchester United’s signing of the summer earlier in the season and Wayne Rooney described the 26-year-old as the club’s ‘best player’ back in October.\nUnited beat Premier League rivals Tottenham to a deal for Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals in his final season at Brentford, but Petit has suggested Arsenal should also have been part of the transfer tussle.\nAsked which rival player would help deliver the Premier League trophy to stuttering Arsenal, Petit told talkSPORT: ‘I saw exactly what I thought about this player against Arsenal, it’s Mbeumo.\n‘I think in terms of movement, he’s very intelligent. He’s got this flair in front of the goal. He’s very good in terms of assists as well.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

I love his behaviour on the pitch, technically, mentally as well. But more importantly, I like his movement, the link with his players all the time.\n‘He brings something different up front. He’s not that physical, but in the meantime he puts everything he has on the pitch. But I love him because he’s very intelligent.\n‘When I saw Manchester United buy him in the last transfer market, I thought, this is a good bargain.’\nUnited’s victory over Arsenal sent the Red Devils back into the Champions League places, above Club World Cup winners Chelsea and reigning Premier League champions Liverpool.\nFor Arsenal, a defeat to Michael Carrick’s United leaves them just four points ahead of second-placed Manchester City as they chase a first league title since 2004.\nThe Gunners, who have now gone three league games without a win, will be desperate to get their title charge back on track when they visit Leeds United this weekend.\nMore Trending\nBefore that trip to Elland Road, Arteta’s side play their final Champions League group game against Kazakh minnows Kairat.\nAs the only team with a perfect record in Europe, Arsenal are already guaranteed to be in the knockout stages and will likely finish the group phase top.\nManchester United, meanwhile, will look to carry on their momentum and make it three wins from three under Carrick when they welcome Fulham to Old Trafford on Sunday.\nCarrick’s return to United was initially only expected to be a temporary one but a number of pundits have already tipped the ex-England midfielder for the permanent job following a superb start to his reign.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Mikel Arteta gives William Saliba and Jurrien Timber update after confirming injuries\nMORE: Alan Smith makes title prediction and calls for key Arsenal star to be dropped\nMORE: Antonio Conte makes Arsenal claim before Napoli play Chelsea in Champions League",
