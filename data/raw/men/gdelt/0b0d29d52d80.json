A picture of superstar Shah Rukh Khan with football legend David Beckham is out and undoubtedly it is no less than a feast for the fans’ eyes.\nA while ago, SRK took to Instagram and dropped a priceless picture with Beckham from an intimate dinner hosted at his bungalow Mannat on Thursday night.\nThe snap shows SRK and Beckham twinning in black. Beckham opted for a black suit, while SRK looked uber cool in a black T-shirt that he paired with blue jeans.\nSharing the picture, SRK also heaped praises on “icon” Beckham.\n“Last nite with an icon…and an absolute gentleman.
