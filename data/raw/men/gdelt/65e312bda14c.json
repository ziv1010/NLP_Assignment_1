  "body_text": "Former Manchester United coach Rene Hake has defended Erik ten Hag against suggestions that he was the primary deriving force behind the club’s recruitment activities over the past few windows.\nTen Hag was sacked by United in late October after a two-and-a-half-year spell in the Old Trafford dugout. During his time at the club, the Dutch coach was often accused of demonstrating a preference for signing players he previously worked with at Ajax.\nThese stars include Andre Onana, Lisandro Martinez, Antony, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui.\nTen Hag spent in excess of £600million on recruits but only managed to lead United to Carabao Cup and FA Cup glory.\nHake – who joined Ten Hag’s backroom staff in the summer as part of INEOS’ coaching reshuffle – spoke to Voetbal International and distanced Ten Hag from United’s failures in the transfer market.\nThe former Go Ahead Eagles boss also insisted that United made a mistake in dismissing them as he felt they would have eventually turned the situation around.\nHe also shockingly claimed that winning titles at United was never the primary goal as Champions League qualification took precedence.\nHake said, “Erik’s dismissal and my departure from Manchester have been crazy. Over those four months at United I can fill four VI Christmas specials. The fact is that we have not won enough. It’s just very sad.”\n“I also honestly think that if we had been given more time, we would have succeeded.”\n“Becoming champion has never been the goal, reaching the Champions League is. It is often said and written that Erik spent that money and that he brought in all those players.”\nHe added, “But that doesn’t make sense. Manchester United has a scouting force of 40 people or so.”\n“Erik did not deal with transfers on his own and you now also see that Martínez, De Ligt, Onana and Mazraoui are just regular players.”\n“They are just good football players, that has nothing to do with an Ajax past.”\nUnited are back in action on Boxing Day when they take on Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux Stadium.\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
