However, striker Mehdi Taremi is included on the bench after recovering from injury.\nArsenal: Raya, White, Saliba, Gabriel, Kiwior, Jorginho, Rice, Odegaard, Saka, Trossard, Havertz.\nSubs: Ramsdale, Hein, Cedric, Zinchenko, Tomiyasu, Elneny, Partey, Vieira, Smith Rowe, Nelson, Jesus, Nketiah.\nPorto: Costa, Joao Mario, Pepe, Otavio, Wendell, Gonzalez, Varela, Conceicao, Pepe, Galeno, Evanilson.\nSubs: Ramos, Sanchez, Cardoso, Ze Pedro, Grujic, Baro, Eustaquio, Jaime, Borges, Martinez, Namaso.
