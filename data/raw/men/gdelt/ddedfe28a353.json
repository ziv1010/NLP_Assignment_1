Premier League result, match stream, latest reaction and updates today\nEverton vs Manchester United LIVE!\nAlejandro Garnacho's staggering overhead kick set Manchester United on course for a comprehensive 3-0 away win on a day when hosts Everton protested against their Premier League points deduction. Goodison Park was a cauldron as the infuriated Toffees returned to action for the first time since being docked 10 points for breaching financial rules.\nThe Premier League felt the full force of Everton fans' ire before and during a match that went United's way as goals from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial complemented Garnacho's acrobatic stunner. The 19-year-old's effort just 113 seconds into Sunday's match was a jaw-dropping goal-of-the-season contender - a fantastic overhead kick that stunned rocking Goodison.\nEverton responded well and came close to levelling before the break, with Kobbie Mainoo, 18, capping a mightily impressive first Premier League start with a key goal-line clearance. The home fans were angered by some of the officiating and the mood darkened shortly after half-time as Rashford scored his second of the season from a penalty that followed the VAR's intervention. Martial was fouled and went on to add his second of the campaign as United won by more than a one-goal margin for the first time in the league this season, with suspended boss Erik ten Hag watching from the stands.\nEverton vs Man Utd updates\nGOAL! Martial seals victory for United\nGOAL! Rashford lifts penalty into top corner\nGOAL! Garnacho with stunning bicyle kick\nThanks for following!\n20:37 , Matt Verri\nAlejandro Garnacho scored one of the great Premier League goals as Manchester United picked up a 3-0 win over Everton.\nA raucous atmosphere was expected at Goodison Park, as Everton played for the first time since they were handed a ten-point deduction during the international break, dropping them into the relegation zone.\nProtests took place ahead of kick-off and the home fans were fired up as the match got underway, but there was a stunned silence within three minutes after Garnacho's incredible overhead kick.\nDiogo Dalot got away down the right and lifted a cross to the back post, where Garnacho readjusted and, as he moved backwards, flung himself into the air and sent a stunning finish into the top corner.\nEverton wasted chance and chance to equalise before the break, as United took a narrow lead into half-time, and it proved costly for the Toffees as the visitors pulled away in the second-half.\nClick here for our full report!\nKeane not impressed...\n19:47 , Matt Verri\nRoy Keane took aim at Erik ten Hag as he he insisted Manchester United are a \"long way\" from competing at the top of the Premier League.\nTen Hag was full of praise for his players after their win over Everton, hailing Bruno Fernandes' leadership qualities after the United captain, the club's usual penalty taker, handed over the ball for Rashford to take the spot-kick and end his long goal drought.\nHowever, Keane was less than impressed with those comments, and criticised the upbeat mood from the United camp as he demanded the team start to deliver against their rivals for European places.\n\"He's giving toffee out there to Bruno for passing on the ball for the penalty,\" Keane told Sky Sports.\n\"Absolute rubbish coming out with that. Manchester United are sixth now - if you went back a few years, if you were sixth you'd be embarrassed. But obviously they seem happy with sixth.\n\"They have a long way to go. Manchester United have to be competing with the best teams. That's including Liverpool, City, Arsenal, and obviously you've got teams like Spurs having a decent spell, Villa and of course Newcastle.\n\"They go to Newcastle next week - we'll see what Manchester United turns up. That's what they're supposed to do, turn up for the big games.\"\nPost-match thoughts from Dyche\n19:03 , Matt Verri\nThe Everton boss is taking positives from his side's display...\n\"For a side that people are saying they're not playing well, they're top of the form guide.\"\nSean Dyche with an honest review of the Everton loss. pic.twitter.com/CaXIWj8uSz— Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) November 26, 2023\nFernandes explains why Rashford took penalty\n18:49 , Matt Verri\n\"I felt Marcus needed a little bit of confidence,\" Fernandes told Sky Sports.\n\"He needs his goal. Marcus is an excellent penalty taker too, I was 100% sure he could score that penalty. It's not about who takes it, it's about scoring the penalty and Marcus did it perfectly.\"\nHe added: \"I think obviously strikers and wingers need to score goals, it is part of their game. Marcus was unstoppable and he could take on everybody.\n\"Marcus last season was amazing so expectations have been higher and it is just about getting those goals back.\"\nWork to do for Everton\n18:35 , Matt Verri\nEverton remain 19th in the table then, above Burnley only on goal difference.\nWith Luton winning yesterday, the Toffees are five points off safety after 13 games of the season.\nStill a long, long way to go, but Sean Dyche will be desperate for his side to get out of the bottom three as quickly as possible.\nGoal that put the result beyond doubt...\n18:28 , Matt Verri\nAnthony Martial on target against Everton for a ninth time!\nAnthony Martial makes it THREE for Man Utd! 🔥🔴 pic.twitter.com/Dr7WYBDRLP\n— Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) November 26, 2023\nFT: Everton 0-3 Man United\n18:26 , Matt Verri\nThat is that at Goodison Park.\nMan United move to within four points of the top four, and six of the top of the table.\nGarnacho sent them on their way with an outrageous overhead kick, before Rashford and Martial settled it after the break.\nEverton 0-3 Man United\n18:23 , Matt Verri\n90+4 mins: Sums it up!\nEverton corner, ball bounces around the six-yard box...

Catches the strike really sweetly, but Dalot gets his body in the way.\nEverton 0-2 Man United\n17:56 , Matt Verri\n67 mins: Low-quality couple of minutes.\nBoth sides lumping it long to nobody in particular - fire has gone out of Goodison. Hosts need a goal in the next ten minutes or so to get it going again.\nEverton 0-2 Man United\n17:54 , Matt Verri\n65 mins: Fernandes away down the right, lovely ball from Mainoo.\nThe United captain has options, as he is allowed to stroll to the byline. Cut back is blocked, another corner.\nTaken short, before Garnacho is picked out at the back post. This time it's a wild finish, sliced well wide.\nEverton 0-2 Man United\n17:52 , Matt Verri\n63 mins: United whip a couple of decent crosses into the box, but you'd back Everton to deal with anything in the air.\nTwo corners in quick succession for the visitors, who are taking the sting out of the match again.\nEverton 0-2 Man United\n17:49 , Matt Verri\n60 mins: United are being pushed right back, Everton still in this match.

Onana tips it over.\nGOAL! Everton 0-2 Man United | Marcus Rashford 56'\n17:44 , Matt Verri\nMartial's yellow card is wiped off - Young avoids a second yellow.
