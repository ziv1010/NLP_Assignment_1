  "body_text": "Alan Pardew has identified Arsenal’s biggest rival for the title after the Gunners extended their lead at the top of the Premier League.\nArsenal, runners-up for the past three seasons, moved four points clear at the top of the table with a 1-0 win over Crystal Palace on Sunday.\nIt was a brilliant weekend for Mikel Arteta’s side who not only edged out a difficult London rival but also saw Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea all lose.\nDefending champions Liverpool’s miserable run continued at Brentford, Man City slipped up yet again at Aston Villa while Chelsea were stunned by Sunderland.\nThe surprising results mean high-flying Bournemouth are Arsenal’s nearest rival, with Tottenham in third and newly-promoted Sunderland fourth after a sensational start to the season.\nFew pundits are looking beyond Arsenal, who last won the Premier League in 2004, but Pardew still expects Man City to mount a ‘big challenge’ for the title.\nPep Guardiola’s side only finished third last season – 13 points behind Liverpool – and have continued to show fragility this term, losing a third of their league games to date.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nPardew, though, still believes Manchester City can mount a genuine title challenge if Guardiola finds some support for Erling Haaland, who has already scored 24 goals this season.\nAsked about Man City’s 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa, ex-Premier League boss Pardew told talkSPORT: ‘That was a strange result.\n‘I’m not sure if Man City were feeling the effects of their midweek game [a 2-0 win over Villarreal in the Champions League] but I genuinely thought that was a bit of a blow.\n‘Mikel Arteta and Arsenal would have looked at that game and thought, “wow what a result that is.”\n‘You can’t but fear Man City making a challenge, I think there’s a big challenge in them even though they lost at Aston Villa, I really do.\n‘The only worry is if they’re too reliant on Haaland, who’s really on form but is still going to need others to pitch in.\n‘In previous Man City teams you would get a few players really contributing but I wonder if there’s enough around Haaland to win the title.\n‘They need someone to step up to the plate and help out Haaland. There’s so much potential in that squad but Pep needs to see it on the pitch.’\nManchester United legend and former England defender Gary Neville backed Arsenal to win the Premier League before the season started and now says the title is ‘theirs to win’.\nPremier League title odds\nArsenal 2/5\nManchester City 9/2\nLiverpool 7/1\nManchester United 25/1\nChelsea 40/1\nTottenham 66/1\n(Odds courtesy of Betfair)\n‘This has got to be their year,’ he said on his Sky Sports podcast. ‘I’ve had Arsenal to win the league the last three years – now four.\n‘They aren’t miles better than last year but are repeating levels of consistency and that’s all they are going to have to do this year to win the league.\n‘They aren’t going to have to get 100 points, or even 90. High 80s will win the title – they can do that.\nMore Trending\n‘Arsenal are reliable, you can trust them. They don’t concede goals. They don’t have a sensational forward, but they’ve got a battering ram who is as honest as the day is long and that can work for them.\n‘This is your title, Arsenal. I’ve never really felt that sure before, it’s so early in the season, but it really is. That’s not being overconfident, or placing pressure, they must feel it themselves.\n‘This is the moment Arsenal can get back on top. The chance is there for them; they have to take it.’\nArsenal will look to continue their Premier League title charge with three points against Burnley on Saturday.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Theo Walcott says Arsenal should have signed £71m Man Utd star ‘many years ago’\nMORE: ‘What are you doing?’ – John Obi Mikel slams Chelsea star and questions Enzo Maresca decision",
