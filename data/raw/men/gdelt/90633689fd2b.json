So perhaps he needs to work on that.\n‘What happened between Mane and Sane is a normal part of football. It’s not what you want to see and hear, but inside I would say it’s normal.\nMore Trending\n‘If you don’t have those moments, it means there is no competition. There is nothing perfect. You have 25 people, and there are no 25 people who love hanging around with everyone. It’s a very competitive atmosphere.\n‘There are players who are in competition, so it’s not bromance everywhere!
