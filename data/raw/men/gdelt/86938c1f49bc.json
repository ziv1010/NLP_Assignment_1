European football’s top club competition is back for one last season in its current guise.\nThe group-stage draw was made on Thursday and there are some mouthwatering games in store when it all kicks off in just over two weeks.\nAdvertisement\nInstead of simply crossing the days off on your calendar until the opening round of fixtures on September 19, now is the perfect time to take a look at 10 players we recommend you keep a watchful eye on during the 2023-24 campaign.\nLet’s get started…\nAlexander Isak, Newcastle United\nAlexander Isak has already had a taste of Champions League football as a teenager, but it is unlikely that his eight minutes played for Borussia Dortmund away to APOEL Nicosia in October 2017 will have him feeling satisfied.\nThe 40-cap Sweden striker looks set to spearhead Newcastle’s attack as they return to Europe’s top competition for the first time in two decades — and he already looks hungry for goals this season.\nTwo in the Premier League from his first three games suggest Isak is fit and firing after injuries hampered his 2022-23 debut season on Tyneside — although he did still bag a respectable 10 in the league (eight non-penalty goals) with some exceptional finishes to choose from.\nWhile he likes to drift inside from the left channel to find space and run at his opposite number, his manager is sure that Isak is the whole package. “Everything that a centre-forward needs, I think he has,” Eddie Howe said last season. “He has pace, technique and strength.”\nA rejuvenated Newcastle join Paris Saint-Germain, Dortmund and AC Milan in a mouthwatering but difficult Group F — the perfect opportunity for Isak to illustrate his prolific talent in his second crack at the Champions League.\nXavi Simons, RB Leipzig\nRB Leipzig could be excused for feeling frustrated having lost some key players this summer, with Dominik Szoboszlai, Christopher Nkunku and Josko Gvardiol all moving to the Premier League.\nHowever, they have invested the money paid for them wisely with an influx of young talent including Lois Openda, Benjamin Sesko, Castello Lukeba and Christoph Baumgartner — with a shrewd loan move for Paris Saint-Germain’s Xavi Simons also catching the eye.\nSimons arrives in Germany off the back of a stellar campaign at Dutch club PSV Eindhoven in 2022-23, with 27 goal contributions (19 goals and eight assists), a return only bettered by Ajax’s Dusan Tadic in the Eredivisie.\nThe 20-year-old has already hit the ground running in his new home, netting a goal and providing two assists as Leipzig thrashed Stuttgart 5-1 in the second game of their Bundesliga campaign. The early signs suggest that he, and Openda, can fill the attacking void created by the exits of Szoboszlai and Nkunku.\nAdvertisement\nWith Simons’ first experience of Champions League football this season, he has the chance to make the next step up in his embryonic career.\nKevin Danso, Lens\nLens return to the Champions League for the first time in over 20 years having pushed PSG all the way in Ligue 1 last season, falling just a point short of the total posted by Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, Neymar and company.\nTheir success was built on a strong defensive foundation — 29 league goals conceded was the best record in Ligue 1 and only bettered by Barcelona (20) and Napoli (28) across Europe’s top five domestic leagues.\nKevin Danso was at the heart of their defensive strength as a near ever-present for Franck Haise’s side, with his 37 starts from the 38 matches (he missed one game through suspension) being more than any other Lens outfield player.\nAs the central defender in Haise’s 3-5-2 (or 3-4-3) system, Danso patrols the back line with maturity and discipline. Given his role, he is less likely to do front-foot defending, but instead reserves his actions until he is most needed — including blocks and clearances.\nIn possession, the 24-year-old will frequently look to carry the ball out of defence to start attacks within Lens’ deep build-up phase — his bravery on the ball is matched by his growth mindset, according to his manager.\n“He works really hard and is one of the few players to actually come and ask me for video sessions, with footage that he has selected himself,” Haise said last season. “For me, Kevin is one of the best defenders in Europe at the moment.”\nLens haven’t fared as well so far this season, with seven goals conceded in their first three Ligue 1 games, but with the ever-present Danso at the back there will be confidence they can go toe-to-toe with Arsenal, Sevilla and PSV in Group B.\nKevin Behrens, Union Berlin\nUnion Berlin are in the Champions League for the first time, and their style of play might be a surprise to group opponents Real Madrid, Napoli and Braga.\nAdvertisement\nTheir low-block, counter-attacking football relies on width from their wing-backs — Union sent 115 more open-play crosses into the penalty area than any other Bundesliga side last season.\nThe man usually battling to be on the end of those crosses? Kevin Behrens.\nWith four goals in two games, including a hat-trick of headers against Mainz, Behrens has started the 2023-24 season in red-hot form. At just 6ft (184cm) tall, the 32-year-old is not the most physically imposing player, but he combines good timing, strength and power to be the perfect striker to spearhead Union’s style of play. Of his 42 goal attempts since the start of last season, 28 have been headers.\nIt is a remarkable rise from Behrens, having had a modest career in Germany’s lower leagues, as far down as the fifth tier, before his move to Union in 2021. This month, he will walk out to the sounds of Champions League music, and his Union side are not to be underestimated with a current 23-match unbeaten run at home (although they are switching their three home group games to Berlin’s much bigger Olympic Stadium).\nDon’t say we didn’t warn you — Union will stick it in the mixer and Behrens will be desperate to get on the end of it when they do.\nJude Bellingham, Real Madrid\nJude Bellingham is hardly a surprising name to see in an article about Champions League players to look out for, with the 20-year-old England international firmly establishing himself as one of the most well-rounded midfielders in European football.\nHowever, this season will be particularly interesting as he enters his first Champions League campaign in the colours of Real Madrid, including two heavyweight clashes with Serie A winners Napoli.\nWhether it was in a 4-2-3-1, 4-3-3 or 4-1-4-1 at previous club Dortmund, Bellingham showcased his versatility to play as a No 4, No 8 and No 10. That versatility has allowed him to transition seamlessly into the most advanced midfielder in Carlo Ancelotti’s 4-4-2 diamond, behind Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo — scoring four goals in his first three La Liga games to take Spain’s top division by storm.\nAdvertisement\nHis role as a No 10 has seen Bellingham drift over to the left-hand side in advanced areas — which has long been Madrid’s dominant flank — to link up with Vinicius Jr and catalyse the attack.\nVinicius Jr’s ongoing estimated six-week injury absence after being forced off against Celta Vigo last Friday, potentially knocking the Brazilian out for the first two group games, might even see Bellingham in more advanced areas for the coming weeks as Ancelotti tinkers with his new-formed attacking unit.\nEither way, Bellingham in a Madrid shirt in the Champions League just fits perfectly — and that is the highest compliment you can possibly pay him.\nGustav Isaksen, Lazio\nAmong the many high-profile transfers across Europe this summer, Gustav Isaksen’s switch from Midtjylland of Denmark to Lazio might have gone under the radar.\nIt shouldn’t have.\nThe Danish forward had a breakout season in his native country last year, with his 23 goal contributions (18 goals and five assists) nearly double his next-most-prolific team-mate at Midtjylland.\nStylistically, Isaksen’s explosive pace and relentless dribbling ability are something of a throwback among wide forwards. While he is not physically imposing, the 22-year-old is not afraid to knock the ball past his opponent then run around him.\nIn fact, during Midtjylland’s run to the Europa League knockout stages last season, Isaksen’s 5.8 dibbles attempted per 90 minutes was among the top 10 per cent of attacking midfielders or wingers.\nIn elite football, a fast winger with an eye for goal is worth drawing attention to. While Isaksen didn’t start for Lazio in their opening two Serie A games, anything close to the attacking return of last season at his new club will elevate him to another level.\nWith the Romans having missed out on Europe’s top competition for the past two seasons, Isaksen has the chance to make a big impact and announce himself to the masses on one of the biggest stages in club football.\nAdvertisement\nLamine Yamal, Barcelona\nIt is never the wisest decision to hype up a teenager who has barely played any first-team football, but there are occasions when there are simply exceptions to the rule.\nAnd Barcelona’s teenage sensation Lamine Yamal looks to be one of those.\nAt just 16 years and 38 days old, Yamal’s start against Cadiz a couple of weeks ago set two records: the youngest-ever starter for Barcelona and the youngest player to start for any La Liga team this century.\nBut there is already a maturity to his game at senior level, with an assist against Villarreal accompanied by a shot that hit the woodwork which allowed Robert Lewandowski to fire home the winner in a 4-3 thriller last Sunday.\n“Of course I am surprised by what he does at his age, he’s only just 16, ” Xavi said after the Villarreal game. “Everyone is, I am not an exception. He nearly always makes the best decision, which is what makes the difference in football.\n“We have big expectations, even more so when you see what you see (on the pitch). He is not starting games on a whim. He starts because we feel he can affect matches.”\nYamal looks set to get his first minutes in the Champions League this season, and judging by his current trajectory you would suspect that — barring injury or a move to Saudi Arabia — he will be a fixture in the competition for many seasons to come.\nDavid Hancko, Feyenoord\nFeyenoord’s first Eredivisie title in six years earned them a spot in the 2023-24 Champions League, with head coach Arne Slot building a strong reputation for his brand of football. No player was trusted more by Slot than David Hancko last season, with the Slovakian defender racking up over 3,500 minutes across all competitions.\nLeft-footed, left-sided centre-backs are a rare breed in modern football, with Hancko’s natural attributes adding balance to Feyenoord’s back line in and out of possession. Off the ball, the 25-year-old is front-footed in making challenges, with his 2.3 tackles per 90 minutes among the top 10 per cent for centre-backs in the Dutch top flight last season.\nIn possession, Hancko is quick to step out and carry his momentum forward upon regaining the ball — pushing forward with frequent progressive carries or passes. Don’t be surprised if you see a marauding run or a raking crossfield pass from him against Atletico Madrid, Lazio or Celtic in Group E.\nAdvertisement\nJust like he was last season, Hancko will be a key member of Slot’s side as they test themselves against Europe’s elite sides.\nKhvicha Kvaratskhelia, Napoli\nWe may well see another breakout star in the Champions League this season, but few players in recent memory have made a bigger impact on the competition than Khvicha Kvaratskhelia did in 2022-23.\nSeemingly out of nowhere, the 22-year-old Georgian winger became one of the most talked-about wingers in Europe as he helped Italy’s Napoli to the title with 12 goals and 10 assists in Serie A.\nThe question now is: can he repeat that form?\nA knee problem has limited the 22-year-old to only 30 minutes of action in the two league matches so far but he will hope to be fit and firing by the time the first round of group games arrive in a couple of weeks.\nAs a reminder of just how exciting he was, only five players made more than Kvaratskhelia’s 32 progressive carries — defined as a carry of a minimum of five metres (5.5 yards) that advances the ball 25 per cent or more closer to the opposition goal line — in the 2022-23 Champions League.\nMapping those carries, there is a clear determination to drive inside, commit his opposite number, and look to shoot or provide for prolific striker Victor Osimhen. It was a tactic that clearly worked well, as Luciano Spalletti’s men reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League — the furthest the club have advanced in the competition.\nThis season, for Kvaratskhelia and Napoli, the next task is to ensure that their memorable campaign was not simply a one-off.\nHe now has a target on his back.\nRicardo Horta, Braga\nIn just their third-ever campaign in the Champions League, Braga could be a surprise package — having broken up the regimented top three of Benfica, Porto and Sporting Lisbon in Portugal’s top division.\nAdvertisement\nIf they are going to pack a punch in Group C, alongside Real Madrid, Napoli and Union Berlin, it’s their record goalscorer Ricardo Horta they will turn to for attacking inspiration.\nHorta’s 22 league goal contributions (14 goals and eight assists) for Braga in 2022-23 came after 24 (19 and five) a year earlier — highlighting just how important the 28-year-old has been to their attack.\nThe eight-cap Portugal international is a double threat. His prolific eye for goal is matched by his undeniable creativity, with no Braga player logging more than his 153 shot-creating actions — defined as the two offensive actions directly leading to a shot, such as passes, take-ons and drawing fouls — last season.\nBreaking this down into its component parts, you can see an overwhelming tendency for Horta to create with his passing. He’s not the strongest or the quickest, but make a run and he’ll often find the right pass.\nDespite being one of the best players in the Primeira Liga in recent seasons, this is Horta’s first experience of the Champions League.\nAt his age and in his eighth season at the club, it is only right that he gets to showcase his skills on European football’s biggest stage.\n(Top photos: Getty Images)",
