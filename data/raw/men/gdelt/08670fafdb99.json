  "body_text": "After incredible performances in our last two midweek matches against Real Madrid over the past fortnight, we host Crystal Palace under the lights on Wednesday (8pm UK), looking to set us up nicely for our next evening guests when Paris Saint-Germain arrive in six days.\nThat semi-final is something all Gooners will savour, but Palace's fans have a huge last-four clash of their own to relish with them tackling Aston Villa on Saturday at Wembley as they spy a first piece of major silverware in their history.\nNeither side can afford to be distracted heading into this one though, as we have won each of our last five Premier League encounters with the side from Selhurst, and beaten the Eagles twice already this campaign. But with this being our final match before we switch gears to the Champions League, Mikel Arteta will demand full focus to keep building form and confidence as the season enters its most crucial time.\nEagles eye Wembley joy\nOliver Glasner’s side cross the capital for this game sitting 12th in the table, meaning their season rests on the German’s ability to navigate a way past Villa on the weekend to set up a third-ever FA Cup final against either Manchester City or Nottingham Forest.\nIt’s a far cry from when the Eagles won one of their opening 13 in the Premier League, but from December onwards their form has improved remarkably. Their 5-1 loss to us in SE25 just before Christmas was their only defeat in their next nine league games, while they went a club record 10 games unbeaten on their travels heading into this month, before conceding 10 in their last two trips at Manchester City and Newcastle United.\nPerhaps that shows that one eye has turned towards Wembley, as well as one win being recorded in the five matches since they beat Fulham in the quarter-final last month. Stockport County, Doncaster Rovers and Millwall were all knocked out to reach the final four for the third time in the past 10 seasons, as Glasner dreams of writing himself in club history.\nWhat the managers say\nArteta: \"[Glasner] has done an unbelievable job. Where he's taken the team and the club to be in the position they are in right now, I think they fully deserve it. He’s given the team a very clear identity.\n“He’s maximised the squad and the ability of that squad, and they are a really tough opponent. They are really well coached. I think he's got a very clear mentality, how he wants to approach games, and they are very competitive to reach their position in the table and where they are in the FA Cup. Certainly, it's not a coincidence, I think they deserve it.”\nGlasner: \"I expect both teams will enter the pitch to win the game. For Arsenal, because they don't play at the weekend, I think they’ll want to stay in the rhythm. We expect they’ll play with their strongest team. They have six days’ time for the Champions League semi-final and they play at home.\n\"I think this is what all the fans deserve: that they see the best teams, and we will play with the best available team tomorrow as well.\"\nTeam news\nRiccardo Calafiori is closing in on a return to fitness after he suffered a knee injury on international duty last month but is not likely to play a part in this game. Bukayo Saka is set to be involved in some capacity, after recovering from a reckless tackle at Ipswich on Sunday.\nJorginho will remain unavailable after suffering a chest injury against Brentford 10 days ago, while Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, Takehiro Tomiyasu and Gabriel all remain out long-term.\nChris Richards will sit this game out through suspension after picking up a red card in the goalless draw against Bournemouth on Saturday.\nLong-term casualties Cheick Doucoure and Chadi Dnanou will miss the remainder of the campaign with knee injuries.\nTalking tactics\nAdrian Clarke, writing in the official matchday programme: Glasner has built a very settled side, with a 3-4-2-1 formation that suits his players extremely well, which contracts into a compact 5-4-1 when they are defending inside their own half. The key men in this system are twin attacking no.10s Eberechi Eze and Ismaila Sarr - when Palace turn defence into attack, they come alive to spring dangerous counters and transitions.\nOur opponents’ super strength in 2024/25 has been their high-intensity football inside the middle third. They allow teams to play out from the back until a certain point, before engaging with them physically either side of the halfway line. A lot of their ball-winning comes in the wider areas too, where the wing-backs Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell offer plenty of aggression. In attack, both have assisted several goals, with the right-sided Munoz chipping in with four on the back of some marauding runs into the final third.\nThat front four of Mateta, Eze and Sarr are also worthy of further mention. They have power and pace aplenty and tend to combine seamlessly with one another too. The Eze to Mateta connection has supplied six goals, the second-best combination in the Premier League.\nIn the air they can be a little susceptible. While they have not conceded many goals from set-pieces, the Eagles have lost more aerial duels than any other top-flight outfit. Balls sent into the danger zone could cause them issues.\nFacts and stats\nWe have won our last five Premier League games against Crystal Palace, netting exactly five goals in both of the last two.\nWe have lost just one of their last 16 Premier League London derbies, with that defeat coming against West Ham in February.\nPalace have won three Premier League London derbies this season, last winning more in a single top-flight campaign in 1990/91 (5). They have also won their last two away in the capital, having won just one of their previous 22. They last won three on the bounce in November 1997.\nWe are unbeaten in our last 42 home Premier League games when we’ve scored first (W36 D6), since losing 2-1 to Man City on New Year’s Day 2022.\nGabriel Martinelli has scored more Premier League goals against Crystal Palace (6 in 9 games) than he has against any other side. He’s looking to score in three consecutive appearances in all competitions for the first time since March 2023.\nDeclan Rice has had a hand in seven goals in his last eight appearances at Emirates Stadium (4 goals, 3 assists).\nJean-Philippe Mateta has been involved in five goals in his last seven Premier League London derbies (4 goals, 1 assist), scoring in three this season against Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and West Ham.\nMatch officials\nMichael Salisbury has been handed just his second-ever Gunners game, having previously presided over our 4-0 win at Bournemouth back in September 2023 when he awarded us two penalties.\nIt will be the second time he has been handed Palace officiating duties this term, which saw a loss at Fulham when he dismissed Daichi Kamada followed by a win against Southampton. In his 11 top-flight games this term, the Lancashire whistler has dished out 31 yellow cards, two reds and awarded just one spot-kick.\nReferee: Michael Salisbury\nAssistants: Mat Wilkes, Mark Scholes\nFourth official: Steve Martin\nVAR: Alex Chilowicz\nAssistant VAR: Adrian Holmes\nRecent visits from Palace\nIt was only back in December that the Eagles last visited our corner of north London for a League Cup quarter-final, and we ran out 3-2 victors with Gabriel Jesus’ hat-trick sandwiched between goals for Jean-Phillippe Mateta and ex-Gunner Eddie Nketiah.\nIn the league Palace have lost their two visits by an aggregate score of 9-1. Last season’s league visit saw us record a resounding victory in the Premier League as we put five past the Eagles, who were then managed by Roy Hodgson, without reply. Gabriel’s brace had us 2-0 up at half-time, before a goal from Leandro Trossard and another two from Martinelli late on put the game to bed.\nAnother big win was recorded in March 2023 when Bukayo Saka hit a brace with Martinelli and Granit Xhaka also netting in a 4-1 success, ending Palace's four-gme unbeaten run in N5.\nLive coverage\nTune into Live From N5 an hour before kick-off as Nicole Holliday and Timbsy build up to the game from the studio, reliving the best moments from our trip to the Bernabeu and looking ahead to the Champions League semi-finals.\nWe'll wrap up all the best bits from social media recently, including Lotte Wubben-Moy's contract renewal. Frimmy and Adrian Clarke will be pitchside with all you need to know about Crystal Palace, while our supporters in the studio try to focus their minds with our Out of Focus Challenge.\nFrimmy and his bag of prizes are back out and about with a quiz question for supporters at Emirates Stadium, before live match commentary from Dan Roebuck and Adrian Clarke.\nYou can also find out which broadcasters are showing the action live wherever you are in the world.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
