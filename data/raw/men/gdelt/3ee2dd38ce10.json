  "body_text": "Carlo Ancelotti has picked his four favourites to win the Champions League, overlooking Premier League leaders Arsenal.\nThe Gunners maintained their perfect start to the Champions League campaign on Tuesday night with a 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.\nBukayo Saka’s penalty and a Mikel Merino brace earned Arsenal a tenth successive win in all competitions and an eighth clean sheet in a row.\nMikel Arteta’s side are yet to concede a goal in the Champions League and look well placed to enjoy a deep run in Europe following their semi-final defeat to eventual winners PSG last season.\nBut five-time Champions League winner Ancelotti does not rate Arsenal as one of the favourites to win the tournament.\nInstead, the Brazil manager has named PSG, Bayern Munich, Manchester City and his former club Real Madrid as the four favourites in the Champions League.\nBayern are the only club other than Arsenal with a perfect record after four games, with Vincent Kompany’s side beating PSG 2-1 last time out.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

We have to accept that.’\nOther teams hoping to make an impact in the Champions League include last season’s runners-up Inter Milan, La Liga champions Barcelona and 2019 winners Liverpool.\nReigning Premier League champions Liverpool endured a dismal start to the season but ended a four-game losing run to beat Aston Villa at the weekend before Tuesday’s win over Real Madrid.\n‘I’m very pleased,’ Arne Slot said after Alexis Mac Allister’s second-half goal earned Liverpool a 1-0 victory over Xabi Alonso’s side.\nMore Trending\n‘It’s been [some] tricky weeks for us, many away games, hardly any rest in between every single game.\n‘Again, we only had two days in between this game but the same was there for Real Madrid.\n‘It helps if you can play in front of these fans and you can play in front of Real Madrid because I think that brings the best out of my players and out of our fans.\n‘A great performance against a team that only lost once all season. It could have been a bit more maybe.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Teddy Sheringham claims two Arsenal players are not better than Tottenham duo\nMORE: Jamie Carragher reveals ‘biggest threat’ to Arsenal’s Premier League title bid\nMORE: Declan Rice sends class message to West Ham fans after Arsenal continue winning run",
