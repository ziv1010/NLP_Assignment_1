Marinos (Japan), Kawasaki Frontale (Japan), Pohang Steelers (Korea Republic), Shandong Taishan (China PR) and Ulsan Hyundai FC (Korea Republic).\nThe clubs in each Region will be drawn into pairings, where they will each play one home and one away match against their opponents. The Round of 16 (West) ties will take place on February 12 and 13 (first leg), and February 19 and 20 (second leg); the Round of 16 (East) encounters are set for February 13 and 14 (first leg), and February 20 and 21 (second leg).\nPrior to the draw for each region, one club from Pot 1 will be drawn at random and placed into Pot 2, in order to have the same number of clubs in each Pot.\nThe draw will commence with the West Region, followed by the East, starting with Pot 2 and followed by Pot 1.\nEach club in Pot 2 will be paired with a club from Pot 1, with the Group Protection principle applying to both Regions i.e clubs that progressed from the same Group will not be drawn against each other.\nThe eight winning clubs on aggregate over both ties in the Round of 16 will progress to the Quarter-finals, which will take place on March 4, 5, 11 and 12 (West), and 5, 6, 12 and 13 (East).\nThe Semi-finals are scheduled for April 16 and 23 (West), and April 17 and 24 (East), with the coveted Final to be held over two legs on May 11 and 18, 2024.\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
