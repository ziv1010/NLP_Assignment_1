Wow. What a team. It was not easy for us and we expect that because it's Africa Cup and we're travelling but we keep patient ... facing these great players, especially Mo Salah, one of the best players in the world.\n\"Of course he always gives his best for the team, unfortunate for him today as well. I just want to say this is part of football.\"\nSadio Mane moved to Bayern Munich in 2022 from Liverpool after winning the Premier League, Champions League and Carabao Cup with the club.",
