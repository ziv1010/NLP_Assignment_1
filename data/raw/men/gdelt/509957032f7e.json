At the end of November 2024, Liverpool welcomed Real Madrid and defeated them 2-0 thanks to goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo.\nThe Reds were without goalkeeper Alisson that night, as they will be again on Tuesday.

That was scored by Marseille in the first game of the league phase, which was followed by a 5-0 win over Kairat in Almaty and a 1-0 defeat of Juventus at the Bernabeu last month.\nThese are familiar opponents and have met in the European Cup or Champions League final on three occasions.\nAlexander-Arnold played for Liverpool against the 15-time winners in both 2018 and 2022 but is by no means a guaranteed starter on Tuesday after moving to Madrid on a free transfer in the summer.\nThe long-time Liverpool favourite has been managing a hamstring injury and was an unused substitute in Real Madrid's last two league matches.
