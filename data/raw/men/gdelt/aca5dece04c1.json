The Finals Series will take place from 1-24 May, with the Isuzu UTE A-League Men Grand Final to be played on the weekend of 23-24 May ahead of the FIFA World Cup 26™.\nCommenting on the season ahead, Stephen Conroy, APL Executive Chairman said:\n“Last season we celebrated twenty years in style with a record number of goals, a fourth consecutive year of growth in TV audiences and the highest total season attendance since 2016/17.”\n“We also saw the prevalence of young stars shining across the Isuzu UTE A-League and on the world stage with 17 players called up to the Socceroos and 15 into the All Whites in the last 12 months. As well as a growing talent pool, we’ve also seen incredible action on the pitch that is exciting fans across Australia and New Zealand. We can’t wait for another action-packed A-Leagues season.”\nCompetition Overview:\nThe Isuzu UTE A-League 2025/26 season fixture has taken into account fan feedback, club requests, venue availability based on shared stadia and live events, Asian club competitions and the FIFA World Cup 26™.\nThe 25/26 season will be played across 26 rounds, with each club playing 22 home-and-away fixtures, plus four additional third-match up fixtures – two home and two away – following Western United FC being placed into conditional hibernation.\nThe complete Round 1 fixture is shown below, while the full season 2025/26 fixture, round by round, can be seen via the A-Leagues website.\nMore marquee match-ups:\nThe 2025/26 fixture features the most ever marquee match-ups, fewer mid-week fixtures and more continuity across the weekend to drive fan engagement in stadium and at home.\nIn total, the Isuzu UTE A-League season includes 12 traditional, cross-city derbies, plus tentpole fixtures across Australia and New Zealand on Boxing Day, New Years Eve, New Years Day, Australia Day, Waitangi Day and ANZAC Day. The fixture also features greater continuity than previous seasons with more rounds including a key Friday night fixture, two Saturday games and at least one Sunday match to deliver more consistency and less simultaneous kick-offs for fans and partners.\nMeanwhile, another blockbuster ‘Summer of Football’ awaits with A-Leagues football returning to Boxing Day, and with fans able to enjoy at least one game of the Isuzu UTE A-League Men or Ninja A-League Women everyday from December 26 to January 4. The action then continues throughout the January school holidays culminating with the traditional Australia Day Big Blue at AAMI Park.\nEngaging more fans across Australia and New Zealand:\nParamount Australia remains the exclusive home of Australian football for the 2025/26 season in Australia. Football fans across the country will once again enjoy access to a mountain of football with every single A-Leagues match available to stream live on Paramount+.\nBuilding on the growth in TV viewership (up 9 per cent) in 2024/25, this season will again see a Saturday night doubleheader shown live on free-to-air – with back-to-back Isuzu UTE A-League Men matches on 10 Drama and 10 streaming from 5pm and 7:35pm AEST.\nIn New Zealand, Sky remains the exclusive home of the Isuzu UTE A-League, with all matches broadcast live on Sky Sport, Sky Sport Now and Sky Go, and selected A-Leagues’ games will be available to watch free-to-air on Sky Open.\nOver 1.4 million New Zealanders tuned in to watch Isuzu UTE A-League football on Sky during the 24/25 season. An additional 450,000 viewers streamed matches via Sky Sport Now and Sky Go.\nIsuzu UTE A-League Men season broadcast notes, include:\nEvery Isuzu UTE A-League Men’s match will be shown live on Paramount+.\nEach Saturday two Isuzu UTE A-League Men matches will be broadcast live and free on 10 Drama and available to stream live and free on 10.\nOutside of the Saturday double-header on 10 Drama and 10 streaming, Paramount+ is the only place to catch every Isuzu UTE A-League Men match.\nNew Zealand fans can enjoy every Isuzu UTE A-League match live on Sky Sport, Sky Sport Now and Sky Go, with selected A-Leagues games also broadcast free-to-air on Sky Open.\nMinis, highlights and replays are also available to stream on Paramount+.\nRegulations factored into fixturing:\nThe ‘Summer Period’, which was extended by a month in 2024/25, will remain in place from early December (Round 6) through to mid-March (Round 20) to avoid teams playing through the hottest part of the day in the cities prone to extreme heat across these months.\nDuring the ‘Summer Period’ there will be no 3pm kick off times, with all matches kicking off from 5pm local time – with the exception of a few matches due to time zones and broadcast commitments.\nFollowing an off-season analysis on weather patterns across Australia and New Zealand, the ‘Summer Period’ will be slightly shorter in Newcastle and Victoria running from Round 7 to 18, where temperatures historically do not exhibit extreme temperatures for as long. Given the cooler climate in New Zealand there is no ‘Summer Period’ factored into the schedule for Auckland FC and Wellington Phoenix.\nThe A-Leagues Heat Policy, recognised as a conservative policy by international standards, remains part of each match’s operational assessment and will be implemented for any match in or outside the ‘Summer Period’ where extreme weather conditions may present a risk for players and the comfort of fans.\nWorking closely with Football Australia and the local organising committee for the AFC Women’s Asian Cup, the APL has also ensured there are no Isuzu UTE A-League matches kicking off at the same time as any CommBank Matildas or knock-out stage fixtures. The A-League will also avoid playing A-League matches in the same market as other women’s Asian Cup fixtures to avoid any clash and maximise support and cross-promotional opportunities between 1 – 21 March, 2026.\nThis season the Isuzu UTE A-League will again observe all FIFA international windows.\nAFC Club Competitions:\nThis season Melbourne City and Macarthur Bulls FC will represent the Isuzu UTE A-League in the AFC’s continental club competitions; AFC Champions League Elite and AFC Champions League Two.\nWith the match schedules for both competitions having been released, the APL is working with both clubs to ensure there is as much time as possible to travel and recover for their adjacent A-League matches. As a result, there are some matches that require final scheduling and will be confirmed in the coming weeks\nMelbourne City begins their Champions League Elite campaign at home against J1 League side Sanfrecce Hiroshima FC, while Macarthur’s matchday one Champions League Two game is away in Hong Kong against Tai Po FC. Should either team progress into the knock-out stages of either competition, the A-Leagues may need to make amendments to the season 25/26 fixture.\nThe dates of each stage of the AFC Champions League Elite, include:\nGroup Stage: Tuesday 16 September – Wednesday 18 February\nRound of 16: Tuesday 3 March – Wednesday 11 March\nQuarter Finals: Friday 24 April – Sunday 26 April\nSemi Finals: Tuesday 28 April – Wednesday 29 April\nFinal: Saturday 2 May\nThe dates of each stage of the AFC Champions League Two group, include:\nGroup Stage: Wednesday 17 September – Thursday 11 December\nRound of 16: Wednesday 11 February – Thursday 19 February\nQuarter Finals: Wednesday 4 March – Thursday 12 March\nSemi Finals: Wednesday 8 April – Wednesday 15 April\nFinal: Saturday 16 May\nTo find out more about the A-Leagues, visit www.aleagues.com.au\nNotes:\nIsuzu UTE A-League Men 25/26 – Round 1\nAdelaide United vs Sydney FC – Friday 17 October, Coopers Stadium at 7:00pm AEDT\nBrisbane Roar vs Macarthur FC – Friday 17 October, Suncorp Stadium at 9:05pm AEDT\nWestern Sydney Wanderers vs Melbourne City – Saturday 18 October, CommBank Stadium at 5:00pm AEDT\nMelbourne Victory vs Auckland FC – Saturday 18 October, AAMI Park at 7:35pm AEDT\nPerth Glory vs Wellington Phoenix – Saturday 18 October, HBF Park at 9:45pm AEDT\nCentral Coast Mariners vs Newcastle Jets – Sunday 19 October, polytec Stadium at 3:00pm AEDT\nSydney Derby – Sydney FC vs Western Sydney Wanderers\nSaturday 29 November, CommBank Stadium at 7:35pm AEDT\nSaturday 31 January, Allianz Stadium at 7:35pm AEDT\nSaturday 11 April, CommBank Stadium at 7:35pm AEST\nMelbourne Derby – Melbourne City vs Melbourne Victory\nSaturday 8 November, AAMI Park at 7:35pm AEDT (Victory home)\nSaturday 20 December, AAMI Park at 7:35pm AEDT (City home)\nSaturday 21 February, AAMI Park at 7:35pm AEDT (Victory home)\nF3 Derby – Central Coast Mariners vs Newcastle Jets\nSunday 19 October, polytec Stadium at 3:00pm AEDT\nSaturday 28 February, polytec Stadium at 5:00pm AEDT\nSaturday 25 April, McDonald Jones Stadium at 5:00pm AEST\nNZ Derby – Auckland FC vs Wellington Phoenix\nSaturday 8 November, Sky Stadium at 5:00pm AEDT\nSaturday 6 December, GO Media Stadium at 3:00pm AEDT\nSaturday 21 February, Sky Stadium at 3:00pm AEDT\nBig Blue – Melbourne Victory vs Sydney FC\nSaturday 22 November, TBC at 7:35pm AEDT\nMonday 26 January, AAMI Park at 5:30pm AEDT\nSaturday 7 March, Allianz Stadium at 7:35pm AEDT\nOriginal Rivalry – Adelaide United vs Melbourne Victory\nSaturday 13 December, AAMI Park at 7:35pm AEDT\nSaturday 17 January, Coopers Stadium at 7:35pm AEDT\nFriday 27 February, AAMI Park at 7:35pm AEDT\nIsuzu UTE A-League Men 25/26 – other notable fixtures\nMacarthur FC vs Adelaide United – Monday 27 October, Campbelltown Stadium at 7:00pm AEDT\nMacarthur FC vs Western Sydney Wanderers – Saturday 1 November, Campbelltown Stadium at 7:35pm AEDT\nPerth Glory vs Central Coast Mariners – Friday 7 November, HBF Park at 9:45pm AEDT\nBrisbane Roar vs Melbourne Victory – Friday 28 November, Suncorp Stadium at 7:35pm AEDT\nNewcastle Jets vs Macarthur FC – Friday 26 December, McDonald Jones Stadium at 7:35pm AEDT (Boxing Day)\nCentral Coast Mariners vs Brisbane Roar – Saturday 31 December, polytec Stadium at 7:00pm AEDT (New Year’s Eve match)\nAuckland FC vs Newcastle Jets – Thursday 1 January, GO Media Stadium at 3:00pm AEDT (New Year’s Day match)\nWellington Phoenix vs Melbourne Victory – Friday 6 February, Sky Stadium at 5:00pm AEDT (Waitangi Day)\nBrisbane Roar vs Western Sydney Wanderers – Friday 13 March, Suncorp Stadium at 7:00pm AEDT\nPerth Glory vs Brisbane Roar – Saturday 25 April, HBF Park at 9:45pm AEST\nContent Sourced from scoop.co.nz\nOriginal url",
