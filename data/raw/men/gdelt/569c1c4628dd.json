Guardiola had also regained his composure after losing his cool in the closing stages.\nHis side have now conceded eight goals in their last three Premier League games and they also let in two against RB Leipzig in the Champions League in midweek.\n\"The performance was quite similar to what we have done lately,\" Guardiola told a press conference. \"The people say you're concerned about goals you concede of course but the chances we concede, no.\n\"It's not the first time we are in this situation where we are playing good but results don't come.\"\nOf the late controversy, Guardiola refused to blame the decision for his side's failure to win.\n\"I make mistakes, the players make mistakes,\" Guardiola said. \"It surprised me because when Erling went down if you whistle then it's fine but when he stands up and continues and the ref made the gesture to play on, then after he makes the pass he stops the game.\n\"After (Haaland) made the pass he stopped the game. I don't want to criticise them. In the touchline sometimes I lose my mind, my gesture was not proper.\n\"I would say we didn't draw for that. They are happy, Tottenham for the point. We are less happy but the performance is similar to what we have done lately.\"\nInjury-hit Tottenham ended a three-match losing run in the league and manager Ange Postecoglou said he hoped his team were emerging from a tough period which began with a loss to Chelsea.\nALSO READ:\n- Arsenal boss Arteta says Premier League has 'gone up a level'\n- Spurs snatch point at Man City after Liverpool drama\n- Emiratis thrilled as Spanish football legend swaps jersey for kandura on UAE National Day\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
