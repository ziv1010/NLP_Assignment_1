A person with knowledge of the details said Parsons and the Packers have agreed on a record-setting $188 million, four-year contract that includes $136 million guaranteed. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the terms haven't been announced. Parsons, a two-time All-Pro edge rusher, becomes the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history.\nFRISCO, Texas (AP) — Jerry Jones says the Dallas Cowboys are still in win-now mode. This is despite the decision to trade star edge rusher Micah Parsons to Green Bay for two first-round draft picks and Kenny Clark, an aging defensive tackle whose production declined last season. Jones and his son, executive vice president of personnel Stephen Jones, even suggested they might use those future first-rounders to help the team now. The Cowboys say they have an urgent need to improve their run defense.\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) — Philadelphia slugger Kyle Schwarber hit four home runs Thursday night against Atlanta to become the fourth Phillies player and 21st major leaguer to accomplish the feat. Schwarber was 4 for 6 with a Phillies-record nine RBIs in the 19-4 victory. He took the outright National League homer lead with a career-high 49 and moved within one of Seattle’s Cal Raleigh for the major league lead. Schwarber leads the majors with a career-high 119 RBIs. Mike Schmidt was the last Philadelphia player to hit four homers in a game, doing at the Chicago Cubs in April 1976. Schwarber had the third four-homer game of the season, following Eugenio Suárez and Nick Kurtz.\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs have prepared for Rashee Rice's six-game suspension by keeping eight wide receivers on their roster. Rice pleaded guilty to charges related to a crash and received probation and jail time. The Chiefs believe they can handle his absence better than last season, when he was injured. JuJu Smith-Schuster has returned in excellent shape, and rookie Jalen Royals shows promise. Marquise Brown is also healthy after missing most of last season. General manager Brett Veach expressed confidence in their depth. The Chiefs aim to manage without Rice until his return on Oct.19.\nNEW YORK (AP) — Coco Gauff kept wiping the tears welling in her eyes between points in her second-round match at the U.S. Open. She was trying to stay composed and trying to give herself a chance to win Thursday night. Gauff’s serving troubles were again an issue, just as they were two nights earlier, just as they’ve been for a while now. The two-time Grand Slam champion teamed up with a new coach recently to try to fix that aspect of her game, and while there clearly is still work to be done, Gauff did figure out how to stay in the tournament, beating Donna Vekic 7-6 (5), 6-2 in Arthur Ashe Stadium.\nNEW YORK (AP) — Taylor Townsend does not have the star power or the name recognition of fellow Americans Coco Gauff or Jessica Pegula, and she's not even seeded in singles play the U.S. Open. Still, she's set to play in prime time at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Friday night. Townsend has been thrust into the spotlight at the Grand Slam tournament after her post-match argument with Jelena Ostapenko and the subsequent discourse surrounding it. A supportive crowd witnessed Townsend and doubles partner Katerina Siniakova win Thursday. Townsend hopes the attention brings more people to tennis.\nNEW YORK (AP) — Tommy Paul and Nuno Borges played well into Friday morning in another post-midnight marathon classic match at the U.S. Open. Paul won the first two sets and had a couple of match point chances to close it out in three. The American seeded 14th instead lost the third and fourth sets and was tied in the fifth after going up 3-0. Paul broke Borges one final time to finish off a 7-6 (6), 6-3, 5-7, 5-7, 7-5 victory. The match that began as the Thursday nightcap at Arthur Ashe Stadium lasted 4 hours, 25 minutes and ended at 1:46 am. It was the 17th-latest finish in tournament history, joining the history books as the second-latest finish in the second round.\nZANDVOORT, Netherlands (AP) — The Formula 1 title race is back and the tension is building. The Dutch Grand Prix is the first race in four weeks. The season resumes with Oscar Piastri just nine points ahead of his McLaren teammate and title rival Lando Norris. Norris won three of the last four races before the mid-season break. Piastri has won praise for his ability to stay cool in his first season as a true title contender. He admits the nerves are there, even if they’re not always obvious.\nSANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) — A Southern California bookmaker who took thousands of sports bets from the former interpreter for baseball star Shohei Ohtani is expected to be sentenced in federal court. Mathew Bowyer pleaded guilty a year ago to running an illegal gambling business, money laundering and filing a false tax return. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday. Prosecutors say Bowyer assisted in other investigations, and they recommended a 15-month sentence. Bowyer's lawyer wants him spared of prison time. The case is part of a broader probe into illegal sports gambling that led to the arrest of Ohtani’s former interpreter Ippei Mizuhara.\nJose Mourinho has left his role as coach of Fenerbahce, two days after failing to qualify the Turkish club for the Champions League. Fenerbahce was eliminated by Benfica in the playoff round after a 1-0 loss on Wednesday. The 62-year-old Mourinho is one of the world’s most famous coaches. He has been in charge of Fenerbahce since June of last year. Mourinho’s spell in Turkey has been turbulent. There was an incident in April when he grabbed the nose of Galatasaray coach Okan Buruk in the Istanbul derby, earning a three-match ban and a fine. He was also handed a four-match ban in February after making an incendiary comment after a league match against Galatasaray.\nFinals\nINTERLEAGUE\nFinal Houston 4 Colorado 3\nAMERICAN LEAGUE\nFinal Boston 3 Baltimore 2\nFinal N.Y.
