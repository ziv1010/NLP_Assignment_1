  "body_text": "COMMERCE CITY – That felt like a Concacaf Champions League game. On Friday night, Colorado Rapids played FC Juárez in the Round of 32 in Leagues Cup. After 90 minutes of Concacaf chaos, one team came out on top.\nChris Armas made two changes from the side that beat León on Monday. Djordje Mihailović was in for Oliver Larraz. He started at the No. 10 with Cole Bassett moving back to the double pivot. Lalas Abubakar started at center back with Moïse Bombito experiencing muscle tightness the morning of the match.\nFormer MLS defender Francisco Calvo was at center back. Dual national Jonathan González was in midfield. Former RSL man Sebastian Bofo Salcedo was not in the team.\nThe first half saw three goals and some wild moments. Rafael Navarro, Jonathan Lewis, and Bassett all missed big chances in the first thirty minutes.\nÁngel Zaldívar cleaned up a rebound from a Diego Campillo shot from outside the box in the 18th. Connor Ronan and Bassett did not close down the initial shot quickly. The center backs were late the rebound off the save from goalkeeper Zack Steffen. Abubakar and Andreas Maxsø both took minor knocks in the half. Steffen made three big saves in the half.\nJonathan Lewis made it 1-1 in the 28th minute. Just after missing a big chance, he got a pass from Navarro. The Brazilian pressed off the goal kick and found his winger teammate for a smooth goal.\nColorado made it 2-1 just before halftime. Lewis went at right back José Abella. The defender slid in with his arm outstretched, touching the ball. After a visit to the monitor, MLS referee Armando Villarreal called a penalty. Off a converted PK at the Paris Olympics, Mihailović buried it.\nNavarro missed a sure goal in the opening minutes of the second half. He crashed the box in transition as Lewis danced on the end line. The winger found him for a smashing header but it was wide.\nIt was about time Colorado scored on a set piece. Mihailović found Bassett for an uncontested header. Navarro played it off the post. Calvin Harris pounced on the rebound, getting it just over the line with multiple defenders on the goal line. It was 3-1 Rapids on the hour mark.\nAvilés Hurtado pulled one in the 71st. He tried to make something happen in the box before Ronan went to ground, taking him down. The referee again went to the monitor after calling a corner and awarded a penalty. Hurtado sent Steffen the wrong way to make it a one goal game.\nThe match got stretched after that. Steffen had a big save on Diego Valoyes on a near-breakaway. Navarro created his own shot minutes later that was just wide of the post. Bassett had a potential break away. Hurtado cooked a Rapids defender on multiple occasions.\nThree big goals:\nOnce again, this was a match of moments. Lewis got his fourth goal of the year and made up for a miss. Navarro had several chances and could not score. But he creates the goal for Lewis. Mihailović was cool on the penalty and bossed the midfield. And that Calvin Harris goal was his first since his brace against Montreal a month ago.\nThis team scores goals in bunches and does it as a group. When they play together, they create quality chances many different ways. When they put them in the net, they’re fun and great.\n“I said weeks ago, I know how to play football. The coaching staff really helped me to hang there. The biggest thing is that the team is doing well and the team is helping me. We can get on the score sheet. Goals assists. We play really good attacking football. We got to keep ridding this momentum,” Jonathan Lewis told Burgundy Wave.\nZack Steffen is on his best form:\nSteffen made eight saves in this game on 3.4 xG according to the MLS boxscore. He had six saves against León then stopped two of five PKs in the shootout. The former Manchester City keeper has just five clean sheets in 28 games all competitions this year. That said, this is unquestionably his best week as a Burgundy Boy.\n“He’s been a guy who’s so constant for us. Since day one in Mexico, the way guys look up to him. He’s a leader. He set the tone around here. To see last game, stopping penalties. I’ve seen it all year long,” Armas said of his goalkeeper.\n“It was chaos. I told the guys to just stay focused. Stay calm. Lalas was amazing tonight. True professional. New father. Shows up as a starter every day, when he’s not a starter. Really happy for him,” Steffen said of the Abubakar and team in front of him.\n“I told him right after the game, ‘Zack, we won this game because of you.’ He’s incredible. He kept us in the game. Big week for them,” Abubakar said of Steffen.\nConcacaf gonna Concacaf:\nA penalty for both teams. Possible yellow cards that were no calls. Late tackles. Calvo bleeding from the head. Juárez fans yelling the P word. This game had it all. And not in all a good way.\nThe Rapids rose above. They got stuck in and made plays defensively when they needed to. They got away with some stuff.\n“I can appreciate how much it means. I would expect nothing else. High emotions. Our sideline, we’re showing our emotions. Everyone shaking hands afterwards. This Leagues Cup, it’s amazing. It’s a wild tournament. These games will challenge you, stretch you, and teach you,” said Armas.\n“I know the way they play. They are very feisty. They love to get into your head. That’s my game. I try to do that also. My teammates calm me down. If they don’t, I lose my mind. Keegan (Rosenberry) keeps me in check. We got each other’s back,” Abubakar said with a smile.\nColorado now moves onto a quarterfinal matchup against Toluca. This is a rematch of a group stage game last year which was a 4-1 win for Toluca to eliminate the Rapids. Armas believes this is a different Rapids team and revenge isn’t a focus. Players from last year do have this in the back of their minds. They’re more organized defensively. This 2024 Rapids team can win that game.\nPhoto Credit: Mark Shaiken\nThank you for reading Burgundy Wave. Support us via our Patreon starting at $5/month. We’re always looking for new talent.
