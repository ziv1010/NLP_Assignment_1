He will come back as quick as possible.’\nJapan international Mitoma has not played since picking up an injury on September 27 against Chelsea and is still out.\nThe ankle problem was described as ‘small’ and ‘nothing serious,’ but he has now missed a month of action.\n‘Kaoru Mitoma is helpful for us in every game, because he has special qualities, always dangerous for opponents,’ Hurzeler said before the trip to Old Trafford on Saturday. ‘If he is not available I am sure we will find solutions, but he is a game changer for us.’\nTeenage talent Harry Howell has played in the Carabao Cup this season but is now struggling with a back problem which has ruled him out.\nMore Trending\n‘Harry had a small issue with his back, so we have to be patient with him because he came from a different environment,’ said Hurzeler. ‘He came from a different intensity to the first team environment with different demands.\n‘And I think, especially for young bodies, it’s very important to be careful with the adaptation. So, in some moments, it’s important to take a step back to make in the future two steps forwards. We don’t have to force it.’\nJoel Veltman was described by Hurzeler as ‘getting closer’ to a return, but The Athletic report the defender will not be involved on Wednesday due to a calf problem.\nLonger term absentees Solly March, Jack Hinshelwood and Adam Webster all remain sidelined.\nMORE: Mikel Arteta reveals double Arsenal injury blow ahead of Brighton Carabao Cup clash\nMORE: Alan Pardew names Arsenal’s biggest rival for the Premier League title\nMORE: Theo Walcott says Arsenal should have signed £71m Man Utd star ‘many years ago’",
