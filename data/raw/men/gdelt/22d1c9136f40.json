Across eight successive seasons as a top-flight club, they have also beaten Arsenal three times in the Premier League at the Emirates Stadium and Newcastle on three occasions at St James’ Park.\nAdvertisement\nBrighton sides have returned to the south coast with all three points from away fixtures against Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham and Aston Villa. There have been a spattering of draws on the biggest domestic stages, too, but they have not picked up a single point from seven matches in City’s backyard, losing the lot by an aggregate score of 18 goals to three.\nSaturday’s game there between the teams is Brighton’s best chance yet to end their Etihad hoodoo. Only one point and two places divide Fabian Hurzeler’s side in seventh from City in fifth with 10 games to go. A win would lift Brighton above the outgoing Premier League title holders and into a Champions League qualifying spot given English clubs are set to secure five places in the competition next season.\nIt has never been anywhere near as close as this. There has always been a chasm between the sides since Brighton’s return to top-flight football in England after a gap of 34 years was marked in August 2017 by a 2-0 opening-weekend defeat by City at the Amex Stadium. Their arrival back on the big stage coincided with the beginning of City’s era of domination in their second year under Pep Guardiola.\nSix City titles in the past seven completed seasons — a sequence broken only by being runners-up to Liverpool in 2019-20 — has been accompanied by finishes of 15th, 17th, 15th again, 16th, ninth, sixth and 11th for Brighton.\nWhen they reached Europe for the first time in their history by finishing sixth under Roberto De Zerbi two years ago, Brighton still finished 27 points adrift of first-placed City. The gaps have otherwise been 60, 62, 40, 45, 42 and 43\nThe first indication Brighton were catching up came at the Amex in November when Hurzeler’s side recovered from being a goal down against City at half-time to win 2-1.\nAdvertisement\nBrighton had beaten City at home previously in the Premier League (3-2 in May 2021), but the circumstances were entirely different. Another title was freshly in the bag for Guardiola’s side on that night, City played for 80 minutes with 10 men following a red card for Joao Cancelo, and they also had the distraction of a Champions League final against Chelsea to come less than two weeks later. A crowd of under 8,000, caused by restrictions associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, added to the artificial nature of the occasion.\nNormal service seemed to be continuing in that November game, played when City’s decline this season was only in its infancy after three straight defeats. An Erling Haaland goal rewarded the champions’ first-half control, but events after the break demonstrated their diminishing aura of invincibility, as well as the demand for intensity from Hurzeler, which has underpinned the now 32-year-old’s first season in charge.\nSpeaking after goals by substitutes Joao Pedro and Matt O’Riley inflicted City’s first league defeat in a game they’d been leading at half-time since that May 2021 visit to the Amex, Hurzeler said: “We didn’t have the momentum in the first half because we were passive; we didn’t play with intensity. Then, in the second half…\n“We talk in general a lot about tactical things, but in the end, the small things can make a difference: how you go in personal duels; how much is your self-belief; how much is your courage to play in possession?”\nDe Zerbi is a disciple of Guardiola’s style and they are long-standing friends. There was mutual affection. The Spaniard spoke about De Zerbi in the way others usually speak about Guardiola when he described him in May 2023 as “one of the most influential managers of the last 20 years”.\nGuardiola added before his team drew 1-1 at the Amex that month: “There is no team playing in the way they play. It’s unique.”\nAdvertisement\nYet De Zerbi, now at Marseille of the French top flight, never got the better of Guardiola in their four Premier League meetings, losing the other three.\nHurzeler also has huge respect for Guardiola’s achievements, describing him ahead of Brighton’s November victory as a “role model” for integrating inverted full-backs into German football during three years in charge of Bayern Munich from 2013 to 2016.\nBut Hurzeler’s pre-match comments before his first career head-to-head with Guardiola also underlined his desire to be his own man as a coach. “You always have to go your own way and you always have to keep pushing your own style of play and keep trying to develop your own things, your own elements,” he said.\nBrighton’s most recent visit to the Etihad, in the October of last season under De Zerbi, is as close as they have come to securing a result there.\nAfter falling 2-0 behind in the first 19 minutes to goals from Julian Alvarez and Haaland, they produced a 73rd-minute reply by Barcelona loanee Ansu Fati and pushed City all the way. Guardiola’s men were hanging on at the end following the dismissal of Manuel Akanji in added time.\nThere was a moment towards the end of that match which, with hindsight, highlights another reason the gap between the teams is closing. Brighton’s long-serving winger Solly March suffered a serious knee injury when he landed awkwardly. The squad March finally rejoined in December after 14 months out is much stronger and deeper than it had been that autumn day in Manchester.\nAn unprecedented spend of nearly £200million ($259m) last summer on nine new signings including midfielder O’Riley from Celtic for £25m. Brighton then added to that outlay in the winter window with the arrival of another midfielder, Paraguay international Diego Gomez, from MLS side Inter Miami for £11m and central defender Eiran Cashin from Derby County for £9m.\nAdvertisement\nAnkle and knee injuries have limited O’Riley to just five league starts for Brighton so far. Hurzeler was also without long-term injury victims James Milner, Igor Julio and Ferdi Kadioglu, along with skipper Lewis Dunk, Joel Veltman and Jason Steele, as Joao Pedro’s 98th-minute penalty snatched the club’s sixth win in succession across all competitions at home to Fulham on Saturday.\nWhere in previous seasons no Brighton player would have been good enough to make City’s team, now there are several contenders — including Carlos Baleba in long-term absentee Rodri’s No 6 role. The Spaniard has been a huge miss for Guardiola since an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee injury in September.\nA front four of Yankuba Minteh and Kaoru Mitoma on the flanks with Georginio Rutter and Joao Pedro through the middle, backed up by Danny Welbeck off the bench, is an enviable range of attackers to compete with the quality of City’s options around Haaland. Brighton will arrive at the Etihad this weekend capable of fighting fire with fire.\nTottenham, Manchester United and Everton — all in the current bottom eight — have won or drawn away to City this season and while it’s only six weeks since Brighton were hammered 7-0 at Nottingham Forest, the response from Hurzeler’s side to that defeat takes them north again with more hope than ever of turning the tide as they enter a crucial stage of a challenge to qualify for Europe that continues on two fronts.\nTheir next match after this trip to City and the year’s first international break is at home to Forest in an FA Cup quarter-final on March 29.\n“It’s been an amazing season so far, potentially the biggest two months the football club has ever had, with the FA Cup — a reasonably kind draw, a lot of the big teams out — and we are really pushing on, top five is within sight,” said their chairman and racehorse owner Tony Bloom, speaking to ITV Racing on Wednesday at the latter sport’s Cheltenham Festival.\n“We’ve got to keep it going. The form is brilliant. Fabian Hurzeler has settled in really well and we are getting a few players back. We’ve had a lot of injuries all season, but a lot of them are getting fit now — perfect timing.”\nBelief will only be bolstered further if Brighton avoid their annual defeat at the Etihad.\n(Top photo: Charlotte Tattersall/Getty Images)",
