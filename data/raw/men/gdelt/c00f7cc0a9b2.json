  "body_text": "Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has reached an agreement to join Manchester City, according to reports in France.\nThe Italy international says he has been left ‘disappointed and disheartened’ over the club’s decision to sell him before the end of the summer transfer window.\nPSG have already signed a replacement for Donnarumma, with Lucas Chevalier joining from Lille in a deal worth €40 million (£34.6m) plus €15m (£12.9m) in add-ons.\nDonnarumma has now been left out of PSG’s squad for their Super Cup final against Tottenham on Wednesday night as the 26-year-old attempts to find a new club.\nBoth Manchester United and Manchester City have held talks with Donnarumma’s agent, Enzo Raiola, over a possible move to the Premier League this summer.\nHowever, L’Equipe reports that Donnarumma has already spoken with Pep Guardiola and has reached a contractual agreement with City’s hierarchy.\nThe report adds that City are waiting for Ederson to finalise his move to Turkish side Galatasaray before pressing ahead with an offer to PSG.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nDonnarumma, whose contract with PSG expires next year, has also been open to joining Manchester United but Ruben Amorim’s side have been unable to offload Andre Onana.\nSpeaking before PSG’s Super Cup final against Tottenham, Luis Enrique took responsibility for the decision that will see Donnarumma leave the club.\n‘Donnarumma is one of the best goalkeepers in the world, no doubt, and even better as a person,’ Luis Enrique said.\n‘But this is the life of high-level footballers. I am 100 per cent responsible for this difficult decision.\n‘If it were easy, anyone would do it, these decisions have to do with the profile of the goalkeeper that my team needs.’\nMeanwhile, Donnarumma’s agent has hit out at PSG over their conduct during negotiations over a new contract for the 26-year-old.\n‘We are shocked by PSG. There’s zero respect by the club after four years together. PSG had made various demands,’ Raiola told Sky Sport Italy.\nMore Trending\n‘In the end, we accepted an offer lower than Gigio’s current salary because he wanted to stay. Then they changed the rules, and at that point, we broke off negotiations to meet again after the Champions League final. We met again before the Club World Cup, and they confirmed their willingness to continue. We didn’t expect what happened in the last ten days.\n‘I understand the need to buy a new goalkeeper, but dismissing Gigio after everything he’s done for the club is a huge lack of respect that I will assess with my lawyers.\n‘Beyond the fact that it was the coach who made this decision, he also works for the club, and my lawyers and I want to better understand their position.\n‘A month ago, we were talking about renewing his contract, it’s strange that in a month, the coach changed his mind about Gigio as a player. This is what saddens me the most and makes me think that in the end, it was better not to renew his contract.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Tottenham icon makes Mikel Arteta sack prediction if Arsenal finish second again\nMORE: Mikel Merino reveals what has ‘surprised’ him about Arsenal signing Viktor Gyokeres\nMORE: Fantasy Premier League changes to points, transfers and chips this season explained",
