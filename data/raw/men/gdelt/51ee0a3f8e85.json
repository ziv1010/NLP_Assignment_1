However, football director John Murtough visited Saudi Arabia last year and made it clear to dealmakers several players might be available.\nAt this moment, INEOS want to identify positions to strengthen rather than look at specific names to target. But sources have told 90min they have endorsed United's current pursuit of long-standing target Olise and he is expected to be a concrete option for the summer window.\nUnited are also still looking for another option up front having failed to sign one during the January window. 90min understands INEOS define 'experienced striker' as someone who has scored double digits of goals in at least three seasons, ideally in a top-five league.\nNapoli's Victor Osimhen is expected to be on the move this summer having agreed to a release clause worth in excess of €100m in his new contract. That number is likely to prove tough for United to meet, but they could enter the race if they secure Champions League football and the added riches that come with it.\nStuttgart's Serhou Guirassy, Bologna's Joshua Zirkzee and RB Leipzig\\s Benjamin Sesko are also under consideration, though United are wary of bringing in another striker who is of a similar profile and/or age to Rasmus Hojlund, who is now enjoying a fine run of form.\nUnited did explore a move for Harry Kane last summer but were given little confidence of acquiring him from Tottenham Hotspur following formative talks and he instead joined Bayern Munich.\nIn all likelihood, United will also be on the lookout for a centre-back. They have been linked with Matthijs de Ligt by German media amid his uncertain future at Bayern, but there is not believed to be a leading contender to sign him at this moment and talk of an exit is still premature.",
