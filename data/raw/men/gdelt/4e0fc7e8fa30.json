  "body_text": "It’s unusual to witness so many regular matchgoers queuing up to buy a half-and-half scarf. But that summarised the significance of a meeting with Ajax in the history of Brighton & Hove Albion. Last night’s Europa League tie was an occasion for souvenirs.\nA 2-0 Brighton win was entirely routine according to Ajax’s recent form book, but a proper giant-killing according to the history books.\nAdvertisement\nA result that feels normal today would have felt absurd in 1994-95, when Ajax won the Champions League final and Brighton, of today’s League One, were dumped out of the FA Cup by non-League Kingstonian. It would have felt fanciful in 2009-10, when Ajax’s top goalscorer was Luis Suarez and still-third-tier Brighton’s was Nicky Forster. It would have seemed ambitious as recently as 2018-19, when Ajax were seconds away from another Champions League final and Brighton were scrapping their way to 17th in the Premier League, one place and two points above the relegation zone, under Chris Hughton.\n“I didn’t realise just how big they were until I left,” said former Ajax defender Joel Veltman, who has spent the past three years with Brighton. “When I came to England, people were like ‘Wow, you played for Ajax. They’re such a big club!’.”\nBut here we are: it is 2023, and Brighton have beaten Ajax, 2-0.\nOf course, this is a historically good Brighton side, having recorded their best-ever finishes of ninth in 2021-22 and then sixth last time out. It’s also a historically bad Ajax one.\nTwo months into the season, both sporting director Sven Mislintat and coach Maurice Steijn have already been dismissed. The underlying numbers suggest Ajax, second-bottom of the Eredivisie, are in a false position — they should be bottom. Across all competitions, this is now nine games without a win, the Amsterdam club’s longest such run since the introduction of professional football in the Netherlands in 1954.\nAmid the chaos, this game was also a reflection of the power balance in European football.\nAjax, for so long among the continent’s elite, only compete at its top table once in a while now, and the Europa League is often their level. Meanwhile Brighton, a historically small club in European terms, reap the rewards of the Premier League’s enormous television revenue.\nAdvertisement\nThe most surprising thing to a time traveller from any other era in football history showing up at the Amex Stadium last night is that Brighton didn’t defeat Ajax by hitting them with old-school British football, physicality and long balls. They did so by outplaying the alleged total footballers.\nBrighton dominated possession. They had a Dutch centre-back, Jan Paul van Hecke, who could intercept the ball, play a pass and sprint forward into attack. As if trying to remind Ajax of what they’re supposed to be, Pascal Gross drew a roar of appreciation for pulling off a Cruyff turn.\nYet, Roberto De Zerbi’s side were actually far from their best in the game: ponderous for long periods, and unable to progress the ball through midfield. Their two brightest players, Kaoru Mitoma and Joao Pedro, both looked dangerous as individuals rather than when linking with team-mates. They were both involved in the opener, but it was scored via Ajax goalkeeper Diant Ramaj’s spill rather than a piece of combination play.\nThe second was much slicker, when Simon Adingra chopped inside and played the ball in behind for loanee Ansu Fati’s smart finish. Again, you’d traditionally expect it to be Ajax — ideological bedfellows of Fati’s parent club Barcelona — trusted to help develop Barca’s promising youngsters. But the tables have turned.\nBrighton are the model of a well-run football club, and there’s nothing to suggest they won’t be in the Premier League for years to come.\nBut you never know.\nIn the Premier League era, Norwich City have beaten Bayern Munich and Ipswich Town have beaten Inter Milan. Bolton Wanderers have drawn with Bayern, Portsmouth with AC Milan and Swansea City with Napoli. None of those clubs are currently in the Premier League, and all bar Swansea have been relegated to the domestic third tier since those matches happened.\nThe same surely won’t happen to Brighton anytime soon. But, just in case, those half-and-half scarves will forever remind supporters of the night when they defeated a genuine European giant.\nGO DEEPER\nHow Ajax imploded\n(Top photo: David Horton – CameraSport via Getty Images)",
