Amorim’s contract with Sporting runs until June 2026.\nRoberto de Zerbi\nThe Italian is now at Marseille – who sit in third position in France’s Ligue 1 – following a successful spell at Brighton.\nHe was linked with the vacancies at Liverpool and Bayern Munich earlier this year as a result of the attractive football the Seagulls played under him.\nBrighton’s defensive deficiencies might have counted against him for those jobs, but there is no doubt De Zerbi produces stylish teams who play slick football.\nZinedine Zidane\nSpeaking of midfield maestros, the mercurial Zidane has been out of management since leaving Barcelona’s Clasico rivals Real Madrid in 2021.\nHe was previously approached by United when Solskjaer left in 2021, BBC reported at the time. Some media reports have speculated that Zidane would not manage in the Premier League as he cannot speak English.\nThe Frenchman is untested as a coach outside the Spanish capital, but his record there, with admittedly vast resources at his disposal, was jaw-dropping.\nHe led Madrid to three successive Champions League titles – a first for any coach – in his first spell, and won La Liga in his second tilt at the job. But could any club carrying a torch for the 52-year-old tempt him back – bar his beloved Real?\nA long shot, but there is no doubt a return to management for Zidane would excite the Old Trafford faithful.\nEdin Terzic\nEdin Terzic led Borussia Dortmund to the Champions League final last season but then departed in June after asking the club to leave.\nTerzic began his coaching career with Dortmund’s academy between 2010 and 2013 before becoming Slaven Bilic’s assistant at Turkish club Besiktas.\nHe followed Bilic to West Ham United in 2015 but left the Premier League club following the Croatian’s sacking in November 2017 and re-joined Dortmund as Lucien Favre’s assistant the following year.\nFollowing Favre’s dismissal in December 2020, Terzic was named interim boss until the end of that season and led the club to the German Cup with a victory in the final against RB Leipzig.\nHe then had a stint as the club’s technical director before becoming their manager in 2022.\nWho else might be in the frame?\nThere are plenty of other names being mentioned as possible options for Manchester United.\nMassimiliano Allegri is currently out of work but has enjoyed success at the likes of Juventus and AC Milan.\nMiddlesbrough boss and former Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick is another name being mentioned, along with former Porto boss Sergio Conceicao and Germany manager Julian Nagelsmann.\nGareth Southgate has long been linked with becoming Man Utd manager one day but seemed to rule himself out of the running when he said he will not return to a coaching role for at least a year after leaving England.\nCredit: bbc.com",
