  "body_text": "“Pep Guardiola represents my version of perfection in football,” Xabi Alonso said in April 2016.\nAlonso was then into his second season playing in the Bayern Munich midfield. Guardiola had arrived as head coach a year before him, in the summer of 2013, although just a few months after Alonso spoke those words, he left to manage Manchester City.\nAdvertisement\n“Pep’s sides aren’t so full of impact because they play in a particular formation, or because he always has good footballers,” Alonso added, in an interview with the Daily Mail. “It’s because there’s a massive amount of work put in. He and his technical team are meticulous, extremely detailed and hard working. Pep and his guys have given me a massively accelerated ‘Master’s’ in football.”\nAlonso worked under many other top managers during his playing days, including Carlo Ancelotti, Jose Mourinho, Vicente del Bosque, Rafa Benitez and Manuel Pellegrini, winning 17 trophies, including the 2010 World Cup and the Champions League and European Championship twice each.\nBut there is plenty of evidence, from what we’ve seen in his early months as Real Madrid manager, that his two seasons under Guardiola at Bayern (79 games, two Bundesliga titles) marked him most profoundly — both in the style of football he wants his teams to play, and the way he works at the training ground.\nThe two Spanish holding midfielders became firm friends during their two seasons together in Germany, and Guardiola had warm words when Alonso was appointed at the Bernabeu in May.\n“Xabi has already shown that he’s a great coach,” Guardiola said at a golf event attended by The Athletic in June. “He has an advantage at Madrid, in that he knows the club so well. He knows which battles to fight and which not. I’ve great memories from our time together, and wish him all the best.”\nFate now has it that, six months later, Alonso is already battling to keep his job at Madrid, just as Guardiola’s City visit the Bernabeu for a crunch Champions League game. On Monday, The Athletic’s Mario Cortegana reported that Alonso’s job would be in serious danger if Madrid are beaten in that match tonight (Wednesday).\nWhenever he’s asked who has most influenced his ideas about football, Alonso always names his father, Miguel Angel ‘Periko’ Alonso, who played for Barcelona from 1982 to 1985, winning three trophies, including the 1984-85 La Liga title.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough born near San Sebastian in the Basque region, Xabi, 44, lived in the Catalan capital while his father was playing at the Camp Nou, and then almost returned to join Guardiola’s squad after he became Barcelona head coach in 2008.\n“Pep told (then Liverpool manager) Rafa (Benitez) that I’d fit very well with his way of playing,” Alonso said in a 2017 interview with Spanish newspaper El Pais. “But (fellow holding midfielder Sergio) Busquets had tremendous potential, so Pep opted for him, and he was great.”\nAlonso instead joined Madrid from Liverpool a year later, and he was a committed warrior for Mourinho’s gritty side versus Guardiola’s tiki-taka Barca during many very stormy Clasicos over the following seasons.\nThe season after Guardiola took the Bayern job, Alonso starred from deep midfield when Ancelotti’s Madrid beat the German club with a classic counter-attacking display in a 5-0 Champions League semi-final aggregate victory.\nJust a few months later, Alonso surprisingly left to join Bayern late in the summer transfer window. “I’ve known (Pep) for a long time, and the chance to work with him was one of the factors which convinced me to come here,” Xabi said at his official presentation in September 2014.\nThe two bonded closely professionally and personally, according to Catalan writer Marti Perarnau, author of Herr Pep, a book about Guardiola’s three seasons in Munich.\n“The relationship between Pep and Xabi at Bayern was very good, and very intense,” Perarnau says. “They established a friendship, which extended to the families. Xabi wanted to understand Pep’s ideas and constantly asked for details to learn them. He was like a sponge, absorbing Guardiola’s ideas about the game.”\nAlonso was already (consciously or not) preparing for his future career as a coach, and told writer Grant Wahl that what he picked up under Guardiola would be handy for the future. “I learnt a lot (during) those two years,” Alonso said in Wahl’s book, Football 2.0. “(It was) very useful for me to understand more about football and how I want to do things.”\nAdvertisement\nThroughout his coaching career — from Barcelona to Bayern and now at City — Guardiola has prepared very detailed tactical plans for each game, based on the opponents’ strengths and weaknesses.\nThis made a big impact on Alonso during their time together, as he told FIFA magazine soon after moving to Munich. “Guardiola works very hard, and spends many hours planning,” he said. “He’s meticulous in his approach, a very methodical coach. He does not impose his philosophy on the players. Instead, he convinces us with it.”\nAlonso’s coaching career began with a season as Real Madrid’s under-14s coach in 2018, then three years at fellow Spaniards Real Sociedad’s reserve team before joining Bayer Leverkusen of the German Bundesliga in October 2022.\nAs Madrid head coach, he works closely with his assistants — especially his long-serving number two, Sebastian Parrilla — to design specific training drills that can be repeated until players know instinctively how they should react in certain game situations.\nThis, again, reflects what Alonso saw under Guardiola, when players had to be prepared to work hard to understand what was being asked of them.\n“With Pep, it’s about repeating actions over and over until they’re automatic,” Alonso told the Daily Mail in that 2016 article. “You absorb his ideas because he’s microscopic in his teaching. You’ve got to pay absolute attention at all times. Not just how to change tactically but understanding why, too.\n“Pep’s very demanding, and if you don’t possess a quick football brain, if you’re not mentally fresh, then the speed and intricacy of what he wants to explain can bulldoze you over.”\nGuardiola has been given the power to impose his philosophy on his teams throughout his coaching career, starting at Barcelona, where the manager is ultimately the most important person at the club. At their Clasico rivals Madrid, however, players have traditionally had much more power than their head coach, with individual genius on the pitch valued much more than tactical nous from the bench.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Alonso was hired away from Leverkusen by Madrid president Florentino Perez in May, many questioned how the ideas and policies he’d learnt and developed as a player and a coach would be received at the Bernabeu.\nThe biggest challenge has been convincing Madrid’s individual galacticos to play the proactive high-pressing tactical approach that worked especially well for him at Leverkusen, where the group collectively bought into his ideas, and responded with energy and enthusiasm. Alonso has often spoken at Madrid — to his players and to the media — about how his team must always be collectively positioned to win the ball back after they lose it.\nThis was also the focus of many of his conversations with Guardiola during their Bayern years.\n“They worked a lot on Xabi’s involvement in the team’s defensive organisation, and preparation to deal with opponents’ counter-attacks,” Perarnau says.\nGetting that to work at the Bernabeu, convincing big-name players such as Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham to sacrifice themselves and work for their team-mates, was always going to be more difficult.\nThere have been moments during the past six months when it seemed that the plan was working, particularly the 2-1 home win against Barcelona in October. Other moments have featured a real lack of intensity and application, such as during Sunday’s shambolic 2-0 loss to visitors Celta Vigo.\nBut Alonso is not a Guardiola clone. He has regularly said that he has picked up things from all his former coaches. When still at Real Sociedad in 2021 he told The Athletic: “You need to be yourself and have your own way of doing things.”\n“They share many basic ideas about football, but Pep’s influence on Xabi’s teams is more general, rather than the finer details,” says Perarnau. “Xabi has excelled at adapting his ideas to the type of players he has. You saw this very clearly at Leverkusen but at Real Madrid, he’s still adapting to the players and looking for the best system.”\nAdvertisement\nOn his return to Madrid in the early summer, Alonso had the club hierarchy’s blessing to impose more discipline and improve the intensity in both training and games.\nThis has meant a Guardiola-like tendency to look to explain ideas in detail to players one-on-one during the week, and also to constantly adjust and organise them from the sidelines during matches.\nHowever, Alonso has had to adapt to the context at the Bernabeu, both in his way of working and his tactical approach. He has shortened and simplified the video sessions he likes to use to explain his ideas to players, while also accepting, like Ancelotti before him, that the team should sometimes sit deeper so that Vinicius Jr, Mbappe and Bellingham have more freedom to counter-attack.\n“For me, there are many similarities between Alonso and Guardiola in their coaching styles,” says former Alaves assistant coach Christian Moya, who has studied each manager closely.\n“It’s evident in Alonso’s body language. He’s constantly active, giving orders, positioning his players. The early Pep at Barcelona was also like this.\n“But I think Alonso has realised that, at Madrid, it’s not as easy (to control everything) as at other clubs. Or that he doesn’t have the same power that Pep has in his teams.”",
