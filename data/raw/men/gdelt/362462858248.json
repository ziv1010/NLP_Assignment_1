  "body_text": "Thierry Henry labelled Arsenal ‘the most solid team in Europe’ following their statement 3-1 win over Bayern Munich, claiming ‘something is different’ about Mikel Arteta’s side this season.\nLennart Karl finished off an exquisite team move to cancel out Jurrien Timber’s headed opener in an absorbing opening 45 minutes of Wednesday’s heavyweight Champions League contest.\nBut Arteta rang the changes as Arsenal dug deep at the Emirates and it proved a masterstroke, with Riccardo Calafiori finding fellow substitute Noni Madueke to restore the hosts’ lead with 20 minutes remaining.\nWhile Bayern pushed bodies forward in pursuit of an equaliser, it was Arsenal that benefitted on the counter-attack to wrap up a convincing victory and move three points clear at the top of the table.\nGabriel Martinelli, another of Arteta’s substitutes, was the man to put the game to bed, rounding an onrushing Manuel Neuer and stroking the ball home to cue rapturous scenes in north London.\nA possible injury to Leandro Trossard was the only negative on an otherwise perfect night for the Gunners ahead of their Premier League clash with Chelsea this weekend.\n‘Obviously you, Declan, are not going to be cocky about it,’ ex-Arsenal striker Henry said to man-of-the-match Rice, who joined the CBS Sports pundits for a chat shortly after the final whistle.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

Before, I used to say that Arsenal can win because I’m a fan. Now I say it without my Arsenal hat on.\n‘The way Arsenal look as a team, as a unit, is different. There’s something that’s happening.\nMetro at the Match: Arsenal 3-1 Bayern Munich\nFrom the Emirates, Metro's Ben Fleming breaks down the winners and losers from Arsenal's statement victory over Bayern.\nJurrien Timber excels again\nGary Neville recently lauded Timber as one of the best full-backs in the world, and it's easy to see why. Got Arsenal’s opener and was superb in all aspects of the game, it's no coincidence that Michael Olise's assist for the opening goal came after he drifted over he opposite flank.\nBukayo Saka singled out\nThe Arsenal forward provided the assist for Timber’s opener, but in open play, found himself man-marked to within an inch of his life by several Bayern players. A reflection of his talent, no doubt, but a problem he will have to learn to deal with on a more than regular basis.\nTricky night for Myles Lewis-Skelly\nLewis-Skelly will need to do far more than this if he is to force his way back ahead of Riccardo Calafiori at left-back. The 19-year-old struggled against Olise when he moved to the left flank and completed just seven of his 12 passes before making way in the 68th minute.\nArsenal match ratings: Raya 7, Timber 9, Saliba 7, Mosquera 7, Lewis-Skelly 6, Rice 8, Zubimendi 7, Eze 6, Saka 7, Trossard 6, Merino 7. Subs: Martinelli 7, Calafiori 7, White N/A, Odegaard N/A.\nLennart Karl, remember the name\nHarry Kane had talked up the talents of 17-year-old Karl pre-match, and the German certainly delivered on the hype. Deployed in the No10 role, the teenager was a hive of energy and rounded off a superb Bayern move for their first goal.\nHarry Kane quiet on Emirates return\nKane won't be the last striker to enjoy a quiet night up against this Arsenal backline. At times, the England captain was most involved when he was forced to track back well into his side's half to stop Saka getting on the ball.\nA reminder that Arsenal are still yet to concede at home in the group/league phase of the Champions League since returning under Arteta in the 2023–24 season.\nBayern Munich match ratings: Neuer 5, Laimer 6, Tah 6, Upamecano 5, Stanisic 6, Kimmich 6, Pavlovic 6, Olise 7, Karl 7, Gnabry 5, Kane 5. Subs: Bischof 6, Jackson 5, Goretzka N/A, Guerreiro N/A, Kim N/A.\n‘We are not there, we know that. But also, the thing about embracing the fact you’re good is vital.\n‘It is different this year but it’s still a long way so all the best!’\nArsenal’s previous win over Bayern came way back in October 2015, when Olivier Giroud and Mesut Ozil were on target in a 2-0 victory at the Emirates.\nArsene Wenger’s sides during this time were often accused of lacking the necessary fight and defensive nous to be able to compete for major trophies on a consistent basis.\nBut the Gunners have transformed into a far more physical side under Arteta, feared across Europe for their doggedness and dominance from set-pieces at both ends of the pitch – even with Gabriel Magalhaes out injured.\nAccording to Henry, his beloved former club have now proven beyond doubt that they are the ‘most solid’ team in the Champions League having conceded just one goal in the competition this season.\n‘They play, Arsenal, but they don’t overplay when they’re in their own half,’ the iconic Frenchman added.\n‘They tend to go long when they know that mistakes can happen and it worked out.\n‘They scored on the counter-attack and they actually scored on Bayern trying to overplay.\n‘I thought it was a good game from Arsenal: solid, especially after the weekend and with what’s coming also this weekend.\nMore Trending\n‘I would like to say they’re the most solid team in Europe at the moment.’\nEx-Liverpool and England defender Jamie Carragher agreed with Henry’s assessment, chiming in: ‘Yeah, Arsenal are the best team in Europe right now.\n‘The only thing that we said before the game, and we’re saying it with Bayern but we’re saying it more with Arsenal because they’ve just beaten them well, it’s whether they can still be the best team in Europe by May.\n‘There’s a long way to go but no one can get near them right now.’\nWill Arsenal win this year's Champions League?\n-\nYes\n-\nNo\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Liverpool’s title defence looks over but Arsenal’s biggest rival is now crystal clear\nMORE: Peter Schmeichel reveals furious Vincent Kompany reaction to Arsenal defeat\nMORE: Arne Slot speaks out on sack threat as woeful Liverpool run continues",
