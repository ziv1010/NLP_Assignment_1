  "body_text": "No one knew quite what to expect when Antonio Conte picked his XI for Tottenham Hotspur’s first game after the World Cup.\nThe physical and mental exertions of the latter stages of the tournament created a fine balancing act between the need to put out the strongest team on paper or to rest tired minds/bodies.\nAdvertisement\nHugo Lloris was a case in point — the keeper was left on the bench eight days after losing in the final with France.\nBut Ivan Persic, whose last game at the World Cup was the third-place playoff just 24 hours before the final, was there at Brentford, playing the full 90 at wing-back.\nIt was a mark of both his professionalism and dedication that he put his hand up to play (Ryan Sessegnon and Ben Davies were both on the bench and could have filled in) but also reflected his importance to the side.\nPerisic had laid on more assists than any Spurs player in the first chunk of the season with seven, mostly via set pieces, and been a solid and reliable presence down the left.\nIn the past couple of months, though, his performances have tailed off to the extent he’s recently been dropped for several games in favour of Davies, now a centre-back by trade, who has started to feature at wing-back for the first time under Conte.\nIt’s hard not to draw a conclusion that his drop-off is due to the amount of football he’s played this season.\nAccording to Fbref, no outfield player attached to a Premier League club played more minutes at the World Cup than Perisic and his 669 minutes for Croatia. He played in seven matches, which included a third-place playoff and two games which went to extra time and penalties. In fact, only five players in the whole tournament registered more minutes than Perisic.\nHe’s already played 45 matches this season for club and country, so could feature in 58 in 2022-23 if he plays in every Spurs game for the remainder of the campaign and Croatia’s two friendlies later this month.\nHe played 58 last season for Inter Milan and Croatia. It’s a lot, especially for a 34-year-old whose position in the team requires energy to help in both defence and attack.\nPerisic was OK in the first half of the campaign. Nothing particularly special and certainly not spectacular (he’s yet to score for Spurs) but a solid, dependable performer whose delivery from dead balls and crosses made him an important part of a team which made set pieces a huge strength under new specialist coach Gianni Vio.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, with Son Heung-min now taking the majority of corners and free kicks, and Perisic not really offering an attacking threat, there’s now a big question mark over what he brings to the team.\nHe’s never been the strongest defensively, but that’s OK with the base of Davies behind him if Perisic is laying on chances, assists and goals in what becomes a front five when Spurs are in the final third.\nHowever, with only two assists since the World Cup and his cross-completion rate having dropped, he’s not doing that.\nIndeed, in the first half of the season Spurs’ right flank was an obvious weakness with neither Emerson Royal nor Matt Doherty nailing down the wing-back spot. Royal was occasionally calamitous and Doherty was deemed surplus to requirements. The left side, with Perisic creating chances and setting up goals and Ryan Sessegnon (in the very early part of the season) contributing too, was less of a concern. Now it’s the opposite, despite some tidy performances from the limited but extremely willing Davies.\nPerisic has started five of Spurs’ last eight games in all competitions and they’ve won none of them. The three he has started on the bench (Chelsea, West Ham United and Nottingham Forest), they have won. He didn’t even get on to the pitch against Forest on Saturday and you wonder whether Conte has lost faith in a player he’s come to rely on for both Spurs and Inter in the past couple of years.\nAt Inter, Perisic was the main attacking threat on the left wing in a 3-5-2 system, isolating full-backs and regularly chipping in with goals and assists. At Spurs, his combination play with a confidence-hit Son Heung-min has not been too effective and often they will get in each other’s way. Perisic will often play a cross from deep towards Kane instead of working his way to the byline via one-twos with Son or Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg.\nAdvertisement\nThat crossing accuracy has notably declined, though, down to 25 per cent against Wolves recently (from eight crosses), or 20 per cent against Manchester City (from five).\nWithout the solid defensive work that others offer (Perisic averages 0.93 successful tackles per 90 minutes, the worst of Spurs’ wing-backs this season; Royal is the highest on 1.72), plus his off-ball marking not as proficient either (Perisic lost Alexis Saelemaekers in the lead-up to what would be the only goal scored in the recent two-legged Champions League tie against AC Milan), Perisic’s worth to the team has plummeted.\nCristian Stellini was asked recently whether fatigue was an issue for the Croatian: “Yes that could be (true) but for a player like Perisic this is not a problem.\n“Every year he plays more than 60 games, so this season will be the same, maybe the World Cup can affect a lot but it depends on him and the team.\n“We expect good performances from Perisic like he did in the past and like he’s doing now.”\nThe fact Spurs loaned out left wing-backs Sergio Reguilon and youngster Destiny Udogie, and paid up Matt Doherty’s contract, and were left with an injury-prone Sessegnon and an ageing Perisic does not look too smart right now, especially considering they have a centre-back filling in on that left flank.\nPerisic was a smart if uncharacteristic addition to the Spurs squad last summer, and while he’s been an effective performer in some regards, that initial buzz and anticipation over his signing has long since dissipated.\n(Photo: Fantasista/Getty Images)",
