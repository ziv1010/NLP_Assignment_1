The Portuguese football icon has clinched the Ballon d’Or on five occasions throughout his journey.\nInitiating his journey at his childhood team, Sporting CP, the football maestro is now leaving his mark in Saudi Arabia, with Al-Nassr. From Sporting CP to Al-Nassr, Ronaldo carved a profound and enduring legacy at Real Madrid, Manchester United, and Juventus.\nNet Worth 2024\nCristiano Ronaldo boasts an estimated net worth of approximately $500 million. The formidable Portuguese football icon is currently drawing an astonishing salary from Al-Nassr. Reports suggest Ronaldo takes home a staggering $74 million annually as just his foundational pay. But that’s not the end of it. The amount astonishingly exceeds the nine-figure mark. Factoring in endorsements, image rights, and ambassadorial engagements, his income could potentially soar to $207 million.\nA significant contributor to his escalating net worth is his venture into the hotel industry. The football luminary has collaborated with the Pestana Group, establishing hotels in locales like Madrid, Lisbon, New York, Marrakech, and Funchal. Additionally, he has a renowned lifetime agreement with Nike.\nFurthermore, Cristiano Ronaldo has lent his name to brands such as Herbalife, MTG, Clear, Garena Free Fire, Louis Vuitton, Live Score, TAG Heuer, among others.

His senior sister, Elma, identifies herself as a ‘digital influencer’ on social media platforms. Notably, she and Ronaldo maintain a deep and enduring bond.\nRonaldo’s formal education concluded by the sixth grade. By the age of 14, it was evident that his path was firmly set towards a career in soccer. However, a setback came when, at 15, he was diagnosed with a heart ailment. Following a successful operation to treat his tachycardia, he made a swift recovery, keeping his dream alive.\nRonaldo’s initial foray into soccer was with Clube Desportivo Nacional in Madeira.
