His nifty footwork which won the Bavarians their penalty was truly a sight to behold.\nLM: Vinicius Junior (Real Madrid)\nNo player has tallied up more goal contributions than Vinicius Junior in the Champions League since 2021.\nHis 19th and 20th goals in the competition may have been two of his most important to date, with his brace ensuring that Madrid escaped Munich with a 2-2 draw despite being outplayed for large periods at the Allianz Arena.\nST: Niclas Fullkrug (Borussia Dortmund)\nIn 2022, Niclas Fullkrug was playing 2. Bundesliga football at Werder Bremen.\nIn 2024, Niclas Fullkrug is scoring winning goals in Champions League semi-finals against PSG.\nThe striker has had a remarkable rise to the top of the game, and he's done so by scoring goals - lots of them. He was at his clinical best against PSG on Wednesday, controlling a lofted ball over the top well before smashing into the bottom corner to give BVB the lead heading into the second leg next week.",
