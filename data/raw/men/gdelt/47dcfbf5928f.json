  "body_text": "At the end of Xavi’s worst week as Barcelona manager, Robert Lewandowski came to the rescue.\nTwo goals from the Polish striker helped Barca turn around an early goal from Deportivo Alaves, gifting Xavi three points and a two-week international break to digest another worrying display.\nThis had been a difficult week for Xavi’s team. On the previous Saturday, they scraped an uninspiring 1-0 win against Real Sociedad before suffering a shock 1-0 defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk on Tuesday in the Champions League. Those two games led to justifiable criticism from the ‘entorno’ — the stage for constant noise and commentary on the club.\nAdvertisement\nBarca were desperate for a win that would show they had recovered some of their identity, but that did not materialise at Montjuic on Sunday. Samu Omorodion’s goal within 18 seconds means the Catalans have now conceded the two quickest goals in La Liga this year, against Granada and Alaves. The visitors could have gone into the break three goals up if Omorodion had been more clinical, but Lewandowski’s brilliant header and penalty 12 minutes from time saved his team.\n“We have not improved much,” Xavi said. “We are in a rough patch. It’s not the best time, but we still managed to get six points from two games (Sociedad and Alaves) that were looking really bad.”\nBut what really stood out from Xavi’s post-match press conference was when he was asked why his team was not playing as it should.\n“I have no doubts that what the media states ultimately affects our team,” he said. “The entorno here creates situations that, in my opinion, aren’t real. They are too negative, and that does not help the team. I see players blocked, especially the youngest ones. The veterans, such as Lewandowski, (Ilkay) Gundogan, even Inigo Martinez, are more used to this.\n“It does not really bother me. I don’t kick a ball, so I don’t have to do anything. But I see players blocked. At half-time, I told the team that no one gets killed by the media here. Even I was labelled at some point in my footballing career as ‘the cancer of Barcelona’ and look at me — I’m here as the manager now. That’s what I told them to revert the situation.”\nThose words were Xavi’s most direct attack on the media since he took charge in 2021. They revealed the manager’s desperation — but also how the week leading up to the Alaves showed the club at its most toxic.\nThe trigger was those two games against Real Sociedad and Shakhtar Donetsk along with the disappointing defeat to Real Madrid at the end of last month. But the reality is that, after two years in charge of the club, it is hard to see much progress in Xavi’s Barca.\nAdvertisement\nThere have been promising games — the Supercopa de Espana final win against Madrid back in January stands out — and great achievements, such as last season’s La Liga title. But the team still do not have a clearly defined identity, which is the cornerstone on which any successful Barca manager builds their tenure.\nGO DEEPER\nThe battle for Barcelona's soul and what two legends think of their changing style\nThat does not mean Xavi’s position is in the balance. The manager himself said on Saturday that club president Joan Laporta had called him last week to underline the trust the club has in him. Barca’s sporting director Deco, meanwhile, told Spanish TV before the Alaves game: “There’s complete calmness with Xavi”.\nEven so, there is no escaping just how ruthless the Barcelona entorno can be in these tough moments.\nThat was clear in the stands on Sunday. For the first time in Xavi’s reign, Barca fans at Montjuic booed their own side in the first half against Alaves.\nSupporters have been extremely patient with the team since their legendary former midfielder was appointed. Last season, they provided Xavi with an unprecedented show of support and loyalty when they applauded after a 3-0 loss against Bayern Munich in the Champions League. That defeat meant they were out of the Champions League group stage for the second year in a row, but fans understood how crucial it was to stay by their side.\nBut Xavi’s public appearances have tested everyone’s patience. The Barca boss has often acknowledged the problems he needs to fix, but the solutions have rarely been seen on the pitch.\nTake this example after their first home game of the season against Cadiz back in August. “We need to respect our positional game and wait for the right time. We have to attack less rushed and be more patient,” he said. Three months later, the team are still struggling to attack.\nOr this quote from before the Alaves game when he attempted to analyse Barca’s rough patch. “I felt that we lost our order over the last week,” he said. “Our priority will be to recover our order and attack better.” But there was no sign of that order against newly promoted Alaves.\nAdvertisement\nAnd while Xavi railed against the media on Sunday, around the club few think he has faced harsh criticism — quite the opposite. Instead, his status as a club legend and his deep connections to Barcelona means he has been granted more patience than previous managers.\nBut, as the cracks started to show last week, you could sense a more tense atmosphere in multiple areas around the club.\nMultiple senior executives admitted doubts over how Xavi has managed the squad over the past week. Speaking off the record to protect their roles, some of them said they were not happy at seeing players being given two days off after the loss in El Clasico. Others expressed doubt over the team’s physical preparation and how badly they have been affected by injuries this season.\nThen some board members feel that, despite all the efforts the club went to in securing attacking talents for the squad such as Gundogan, Joao Cancelo and Joao Felix, Barca have still not progressed towards an attractive playing style.\nThat was one of the biggest aims for Xavi himself this season after a deserved (but functional) league win last campaign. But, apart from two consecutive 5-0 wins at the start of the season against Royal Antwerp and Real Betis, Barca have been nowhere near their lofty standards in that department.\nAbove all else, however, this was a difficult week for the dressing room. In the immediate aftermath of the Sociedad win, Xavi blamed his players on the record for not playing with the intensity he demanded of them. By midweek, after the humiliating defeat to Shakhtar, the manager had changed his tune and said the team’s problems were only football-related.\nGO DEEPER\nBarcelona's dressing-room dynamic is changing - Gundogan's Clasico criticism proves it\nThe constant change in messaging has, according to dressing room sources, left the players feeling detached over recent days. Sources also attribute that to bad results which have only served to make things worse.\nAdvertisement\nBut that lack of dressing-room harmony felt even more evident after Spanish broadcaster Movistar released footage from the Alaves game which showed Lewandowski reprimanding the 16-year-old Lamine Yamal for not passing him the ball.\n“Lamine! Cross it to the far post!” Lewandowski was seen shouting at Yamal before the striker then refused to shake hands with the teenager — something the 34-year-old Lewandowski has denied.\nIt all adds up to a concerning picture. And while there were always going to be complexities in managing a club the size of Barcelona, it feels misleading for Xavi to label the media’s toxicity as the main reason for his team’s dysfunction on the pitch. Not least because he and his coaching staff contribute to the opinions around the club; the coaching staff have regularly spoken to the media to reflect their thoughts and frustrations since Xavi returned to the club.\nBackroom staff sources were open in expressing how they had to accept the club was not able to sign Xavi’s top-priority targets in key positions — such as Juan Foyth at right-back, Martin Zubimendi in holding midfield and Bernardo Silva as an attacking midfielder. That Barca were only able to spend €4million ($4.3m; £3.5m) on signings last summer also frustrated them.\nThey all highlighted how Xavi has had to operate in an extremely complex situation, on and off the pitch — and that is true. But both the fanbase and the media have been vastly understanding of that. Nobody is asking Xavi to replicate the success of the Pep Guardiola era; this is a different team at a different time.\nBut if the analysis of his side does not go further than calling out critics in the media, then Xavi and Barca will both be in big trouble.\n“Now it’s a moment for the manager to act,” he said before the Alaves match.\nThe international break feels like the perfect moment for Xavi to prove those are not empty words.\n(Top photo: Urbanandsport/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
