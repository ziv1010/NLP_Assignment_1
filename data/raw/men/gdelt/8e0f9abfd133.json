Today, Mbappe will be up against Ronaldo in the flesh.\nFrance and Portugal will face-off in the quarter-finals of Euro 2024. While multiple world-class players will be in action for both sides, it is hard to escape this being a gladiatorial duel between Ronaldo and Mbappe.\nThe match will be broadcast live on GOtv (ch 61) at 8pm this evening.\nThis is not the first time the two icons have shared a pitch. They met in the 2017-18 Champions League last 16, when Real Madrid comfortably beat Mbappe’s PSG 5-2 on aggregate – on Ronaldo’s way to a fourth and final Champions League trophy in Spain.\nMbappe was yet to break into the senior France squad when they were beaten by Ronaldo’s Portugal in the Euro 2016 final, while Ronaldo scored twice in a 2-2 draw in the group stages to help Portugal reach the knockouts at Euro 2020.\nThis game in Hamburg has a totally different context to the Champions League meeting six years ago. Back then, Mbappe was a 19-year-old on loan from Monaco – full of potential and the subject of hype, but far from the finished product.\nNow he is 25, widely regarded as the world’s best player and the man on whose slim shoulders France’s hopes of a first European title since 2000 rest – at times in this tournament quite uneasily.\nMbappe will this summer move to Real Madrid,where he is expected to be the main man. The focal point and grand attraction. That was the role served by Ronaldo in his prime.\nSix years on, Ronaldo – away from playing his club football in Saudi Arabia – is still a focal point who grabs attention.\nThe 39-year-old’s role in the Portugal team is the subject of great discussion after a last-16 display against Slovenia summarised by wayward free-kicks, a saved penalty and floods of tears.\nYet Ronaldo can still deliver when it counts, tucking away his spot-kick in the shootout – though it was goalkeeper Diogo Costa who took the spotlight with three successive saves.\nBut before this clash between Mbappe and Ronaldo, three-time champions, Spain will be aiming to spoil Germany’s hopes of lifting the Euro 2024 trophy on home soil.\nThe match will be broadcast live on GOtv (ch 61) at 5 pm this evening.\nLuis De La Fuente’s side are the only team in the tournament to have won all their games so far, thus reasserting themselves as tournament favourites.\nThey will however be up against a resurgent German team under the tutelage of Julian Nagelsmann.\nLa Roja head into this clash unbeaten against the Germans in their last four major matches, most recently, a 1-1 draw in the group stage of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The Spaniards emerged victorious the last time they clashed at the continental showpiece as Fernando Torres’ strike ensured they won their second Euro title.\nTomorrow, the Three Lions of England will continue their quest for glory when they take on Switzerland on GO Football (ch 61) at 5 pm.\nGareth Southgate’s side overturned a goal deficit against Slovakia in the knockout stage to win 2-1, while Switzerland’s impressive performance saw them knockout incumbent champions, Italy.\nNetherlands and Turkey will go head-to-head same Saturday for a place in the semi-finals. Ronald Koeman’s side thumped Romania 3-0 to advance, while Vincezo Montella’s side saw off pressure from Austria to win 2-1 in the Round of 16.\nTODAY\nSpain v Germany\nPortugal v France\nSATURDAY\nEngland v Switzerland\nNetherlands v Turkey",
