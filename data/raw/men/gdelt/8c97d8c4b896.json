  "body_text": "good morning - your top chef recap will be coming a day later this week.\nThe Hoddle of Coffee: Tottenham Hotspur news and links for Tuesday, May 30\nThere’s a party in Luton\nThere’s a party in Luton!\nThe Hatters capped off a remarkable run up the football pyramid by beating Coventry City 6-5 on penalties in the EFL Championship playoff final on Sunday.\nWho’s not going to love seeing Harry Kane in a Manchester United kit playing at Kenilworth Road next season?\nSaturday’s playoff final wasn’t the ringing endorsement of the second division this year. These teams looked like two that were playing their 49th league fixture this season. And as the game wore on, they looked less and less likely to score.\nTurns out - that rang true (minus one goal ruled off for handball).\nLet’s put in a particular round of credit for Rob Edwards who became the first manager in EFL history to get the sack and be promoted in the same season.\nFor those who don’t know: Watford and Luton Town are hated rivals. That’s got to hurt for Watford fans!\nWho knows what next season will bring with Luton in the Premier League. There’s going to be a lot of change in the squad and we don’t even know for sure yet if they’ll be playing at Kenilworth Road.\nStill, regardless how it unfolds, it’s going to be a heck of a fun run. And let’s hope they invest that sweet, sweet Premier League television revenue wisely.\nFitzie’s track of the day: Thirteen, by Big Star\nAnd now for your links:\nAlasdair Gold on Daniel Levy’s challenge, Pedro Porro big moment and more\nSheffield Wednesday promoted to EFL Championship\nLuton aren’t the only feel-good story. Check out Lens’ run from Ligue 2 to the Champions League",
