  "body_text": "Tottenham Hotspur are now looking to sign the Crystal Palace attacker Eberechi Eze during the summer transfer window.\nAccording to a report from Fichajes, they are looking to sign the 27-year-old as a replacement for James Maddison, who is likely to be sidelined for several months with ACL damage.\nThey need more creativity and cutting edge in the final third, and Eze would be a superb acquisition. Spurs are now seriously considering a move for the England international. Eze registered 25 goal contributions last season.\nSpurs face Arsenal competition for Eze\nThe player is reportedly valued at £65 million, and Tottenham will face competition from rivals Arsenal as well. It will be interesting to see which of the two clubs can get the deal done. The player will look to compete at a high level, and both clubs will be able to provide him with UEFA Champions League football for the upcoming campaign.\nAt Arsenal, he will face more competition for places, but he will be able to fight for league titles and the UEFA Champions League. On the other hand, he will get regular gametime at Tottenham, but they are going through a period of rebuilding, and they might not be able to challenge for major trophies right away.\nIt will be interesting to see how the situation develops.\nEberechi Eze would improve Spurs\nBoth clubs have the resources to pay the asking price for him, and he could transform them going forward. He’s capable of operating on either flank as well as centrally. He will look to create opportunities for his teammates and find the back of the net as well.\nHe helped Crystal Palace win the FA Cup last season, and this is the right time for him to take the next step and compete at a higher level. It will be interesting to see if he can win major trophies in the coming seasons.",
