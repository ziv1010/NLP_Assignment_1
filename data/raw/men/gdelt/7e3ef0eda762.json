Here's how things have gone...\nLiverpool vs Real Madrid H2H record\n1. Real Madrid 0-1 Liverpool - 27 May 1981\nThe Merseyside club came face to face with Real Madrid for the first time in the 1981 European Cup final. The fixture took place at Parc des Princes, the home of Paris Saint-Germain, in the French capital.\nAlan Kennedy scored the only goal of the game eight minutes from time as the Reds won 1-0 to become European champions for the third time in five seasons.\nReal Madrid's team that day included Vicente del Bosque, who also enjoyed a successful spell as the club's manager.\nAs for the English side, their team was full of household names such as Kenny Dalglish, Graeme Souness and Alan Hansen.\n2. Real Madrid 0-1 Liverpool - 25 February 2009\nThe pair next met 28 years later in the Champions League round of 16 in 2009, as Rafa Benitez's side earned a narrow 1-0 victory at the Bernabeu in the first leg.\nYossi Benayoun was the goalscorer that day, heading home a Fabio Aurelio free-kick. Liverpool looked comfortable throughout, limiting their opponents to mostly long-range speculative efforts.\nBenitez received much praise for his tactical approach that night and that away victory put them in the driving seat for the second leg that was to follow approximately a fortnight later...\n3. Liverpool 4-0 Real Madrid - 10 March 2009\nLiverpool emphatically finished the job they started in the first leg with a comprehensive victory over the Spaniards in the second fixture.\nFernando Torres was the star of the show that day. The former Atletico Madrid star scored the opener against his old adversaries, Steven Gerrard added a brace and substitute Andrea Dossena grabbed a fourth.\nBenitez's side 'outclassed' Los Blancos over the course of the tie but went on to be eliminated at the quarter-final stage by their domestic rivals Chelsea.\n4. Liverpool 0-3 Real Madrid - 22 October 2014\nFive years later, former Manchester United man Cristiano Ronaldo was on the scoresheet for Real Madrid as they ran out 3-0 winners at Anfield.\nThe pair were drawn together in the group stages, giving Madrid the chance to avenge the defeat they had suffered in 2009.\nKarim Benzema was also on target, scoring Real's second and third goals of the night. This was the first time Liverpool had ever been three goals down at half-time at Anfield.\n5. Real Madrid 1-0 Liverpool - 4 November 2014\nBenzema scored the only goal of the game in the return fixture just shy of the half hour mark.\nBrendan Rodgers, the Liverpool boss at the time, made seven changes to the side that had faced Newcastle in the Premier League the weekend prior and that meant leaving the likes of Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho on the bench.\nLiverpool showed more attacking endeavour in the second half but failed to equalise and the La Liga club completed a comfortable double over the Reds in Group B that season.\n6. Real Madrid 3-1 Liverpool - 26 May 2018\nSome 37 years later, Real Madrid finally got their revenge on Liverpool for their European Cup final defeat in 1981.\nThe two met in the Ukrainian capital in the 2018 Champions League final but Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool suffered a heart-breaking defeat. A combination of Gareth Bale's brilliance and a disastrous display from Loris Karius contributed to the outcome, leaving the Premier League side heartbroken.\nStill, Liverpool made up for it a year later...\n7. Real Madrid 3-1 Liverpool - 6 April 2021\nNo Virgil van Dijk, no Jordan Henderson, no Joe Gomez...all those absences and more spelt big trouble for Liverpool in the first leg of their quarter-final tie with Real.\nA makeshift backline was put to the sword as Brazilian forward Vinicius Junior scored twice and Marco Asensio netted.\nMohamed Salah did strike to give the Reds some hope of a comeback for the second leg.\n8. Liverpool 0-0 Real Madrid - 14 April 2021\nThe tie had pretty much gone by the time the second leg came around. With no raucous Anfield crowd backing them due to Covid-19 restrictions, the Reds couldn't find a way through Real's staunch backline.\nWith Salah and Georginio Wijnaldum squandering opportunities, Real \"rode the storm\" as then manager Zinedine Zidane put it to set up a semi-final tie with eventual winners Chelsea.\n9. Liverpool 0-1 Real Madrid - 28 May 2022\nFour years after their classic encounter in Kyiv, Liverpool and Real Madrid locked horns once more in the Champions League final.\nThis time the game was settled by just a single goal, scored by outstanding winger Vinicius Junior, and will be forever remembered for an incredible save from Sadio Mane by Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.\n10. Liverpool 2-5 Real Madrid - 21 February 2023\nNine months later and a frankly unbelievable night at Anfield saw Real Madrid come from 2-0 down to beat Liverpool 5-2 in the first leg of their round of 16 clash.\nThe two had been pitted against one another after Napoli topped Liverpool in the group stages, but it was the Reds who were out of the traps quickly thanks to goals from Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah.\nBut a Vinicius Junior double, Eder Militao header and Karim Benzema brace turned the tie on its head - a chastening night for Jurgen Klopp's stunned side.\nLiverpool vs Real Madrid H2H record\n- Liverpool wins: 3\n- Real Madrid wins: 6\n- Draws: 1",
