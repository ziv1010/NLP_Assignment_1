Terrific goal-line rescues to prevent a second.\nGood lord, he just did it again. Never seen anything quite like that. Instant Sheedy-esque legend.\n4 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:31:55\nThey were covering that entire side of the goal and a bit more. The curve he put on it was just Existential...\nAnd blow me if he's just gone and done it again. An absolute screamer from a dead ball, although this time the Arsenal players created the gap.\nBut it is almost exactly into the top corner. Amazing!\n5 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:32:07\n6 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:34:20\n7 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:35:04\n8 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:35:39\nWe drew with them on Saturday\n9 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:36:07\n10 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:36:26\n11 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:36:52\nCarlo might not be able to get them back from this...\n12 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:37:11\n13 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:38:10\nNow it's three, I just hope that Arsenal keep going because Real Madrid have been very poor during the second period\n14 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:41:23\nTo make any statement like that denigrates the absolute and unequivocal brilliance of the strike.\n15 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:41:34\n16 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:42:26\n17 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:43:56\n18 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:44:11\n19 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:45:30\n20 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:46:27\nIt’s a bugbear of mine, and does nothing for entertainment I know🤷♂️\n21 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:47:05\nLiam, really? That's crazy.\n22 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:47:50\n23 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:51:33\n24 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:51:50\nThere was at least a full body in the wall beyond the line betwixt ball and post.\nTony,\n\"That there is a wall in the first place\" — What the fuck? Are you saying there shouldn't have been a wall at all? Bugbears be damned — you're babbling now.\nThe goalkeeper had almost the entire goal covered and was barely inches away from saving it.\nBut no-one was saving that!\n25 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:53:13\n26 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:53:22\n27 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:55:11\n28 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:55:31\nIt's a wonderful strike but inches are massive when it results in a goal, especially from so far out.\n29 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:56:05\n30 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:56:08\nStill can't take anything away from the strike though.\n31 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:57:29\n32 Posted 08/04/2025 at 21:58:42\n33 Posted 08/04/2025 at 22:01:04\n34 Posted 08/04/2025 at 22:01:57\nI've had this discussion with a few keepers and although none of them ever came out and agreed with me, a couple of them did say they had never considered not having a proper wall, but for shots so far out, I actually made sense.\n35 Posted 08/04/2025 at 22:02:06\nIt's a moot point though as even if it was wider it would have still gone in.\nAlthough maybe if it had been wider he might not have tried it?\nAnyway, unbelievable strikes from a player who has never scored a free kick!\n36 Posted 08/04/2025 at 22:02:11\nHopefully even John Lydon is taking a break from moaning about everything to enjoy that\n37 Posted 08/04/2025 at 22:03:08\n38 Posted 08/04/2025 at 22:07:12\nTony, I'll have to put some thought into your radical idea that there shouldn't even be a wall.\n…\nOkay, I've thought about it.\nYou're fucking crazy.\n39 Posted 08/04/2025 at 22:08:14\nClarence Seedorf, Wayne Rooney, Cesc Fabregas and... er... Sturridge in some embarrassing clobber.\n40 Posted 08/04/2025 at 22:08:49\nRice driving forward rather than his crab like strolling around football against us.\nTake nothing away from them. Great result and some great goals.\n42 Posted 08/04/2025 at 22:11:03\nThat's Arteta getting another year. My two gooner mates want him gone.\n43 Posted 08/04/2025 at 22:12:02\nI'm with Clarence Serdorf who has just said the wall was wrong, not wide enough and should have had 5 players in!\n44 Posted 08/04/2025 at 22:12:28\nhttps://www.facebook.com/reel/656681596970558?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v\n45 Posted 08/04/2025 at 22:14:10\nYou not agreeing with me, isn’t a problem Michael, but, my own view is that I’m sure some of the Madrid players will be questioning their keeper for that first goal, even though it was an incredible strike, and he had already kept them in the game up to then.\nI have an Arsenal mate who is not overly impressed with Arteta, Paul, and I said to him the other week that although they have been poor in the league and I don’t think they play aggressively enough considering the players they have, it actually wouldn’t surprise me if they won the champions league and it kept him in his job. We will see\n47 Posted 08/04/2025 at 22:22:20\n48 Posted 08/04/2025 at 22:26:19\nThere's having an opinion … and then there's saying something that is just fucking crazy.\nNot having any wall at all would be just fucking crazy in that situation. End of.\n49 Posted 08/04/2025 at 22:45:16\n50 Posted 08/04/2025 at 22:53:10\nInstead of end of, can you explain why you think it would be crazy, in a calm and measured way?\nSeriously the keeper had a wall, and this lead him to expose two thirds of his goal and resulted in him conceding a goal.\nYou have already said, that by having this view I denigrate the goal, but not once have I not said it was a great strike, Michael, so just like the keeper, I don’t think your angle is quite right!\nI think it’s madness having a wall for shots so far out, if it means the goalkeeper leaves too much of his goal exposed, and especially if this means the keeper doesn’t see the ball properly until it has already gone past his wall.\nThe keeper had a wall tonight and Rice used it to his absolute advantage for his first goal, but do you seriously think Rice would have scored from that far out if the Keepers starting position would have been in the centre of his goal, and he’d had a perfect view of the ball when it was initially struck?\nI honestly don’t Michael….and although I actually might be a little bit crazy or off the wall sometimes, I think my view is perfectly logical, when I question why one big wall is actually needed, for shots that are so far out.\n51 Posted 08/04/2025 at 23:42:27\nHence why a GK building their own wall and positioning it where they want it will always happen. If they build it right then it should take something truly sensational to beat them, as happened (twice) tonight.\n52 Posted 09/04/2025 at 00:11:19\nBayern? Inter? Real? Arsenal?\nThese are clubs so far advanced for many decades from where we've been consigned to by hideous owners/bosses that I'm baffled as to why the moderators, whomever they now are, permit it==such comment on this site.\nAfter all, mere mention of one predominantly successful North West club since the instigation of TW, and for decades beforehand in truth, has caused some of us to be red-carded by one \"MK\", who nonetheless now spouts above on any number of other non-entity clubs jousting for success whilst WE remain in a quagmire of mediocrity.\nWhat is going on on TW MK?\n53 Posted 09/04/2025 at 01:14:40\n54 Posted 09/04/2025 at 01:52:26\nI agreed with your post then kept reading more posts now I’m wondering which one you meant or was it several? Lot of contenders.\n55 Posted 09/04/2025 at 03:33:52\nSpot on Mr. Gaynes. Were you thinking of that post that claimed that Beto's most recent pitiful one-on-one was not a \"miss\"?\n56 Posted 09/04/2025 at 06:07:02\nThe amount of goal that we concede from free kicks does my nut in, amount of time Pickford let's free kicks in by standing one side of his goal, the Man United Bruno one in the 2-2 draw pickled my head, wasn't even a good free kick so much.\nKeepers need to start backing themselves in the middle of the goal\n57 Posted 09/04/2025 at 07:43:09\nMaybe have just 2 as a precaution?\nThey're the professionals I suppose and I was never a keeper. If I was in the wall, I just did what we'd practiced and did what the keeper said!\nDon, this was Michael's way of policing the forum and stopping non-Everton related comments littering the threads. Me being guilty and getting a MK \"booking\" on more than one occasion.\nI don't mind, I'll watch any game of football if Everton aren't playing.\nIt does make me envious of where we could have been but for the obvious reasons you highlight.\n58 Posted 09/04/2025 at 07:48:11\n59 Posted 09/04/2025 at 08:16:25\n60 Posted 09/04/2025 at 10:09:24\nFootball to most of us is, or should be all about entertainment (if we weren’t so personally invested, it would probably be the only thing that mattered) and from an entertainment perspective Declan Rice scored a sensational goal, but just because I thought he was aided massively by the goalkeeper, the editor has called me fucking crazy🤷♂️\nI find nothing wrong with Michael calling me crazy, but not when it comes to debating football, because the only thing I have ever took serious in my life is football, and even though I don’t take it anywhere near as seriously these days, I still love debating with knowledgeable and sensible people.\n61 Posted 09/04/2025 at 10:10:41\n62 Posted 09/04/2025 at 16:20:53\n63 Posted 09/04/2025 at 16:59:05\n64 Posted 09/04/2025 at 18:15:39\nThere's a column on the BBC-F site - \"Unstoppable? Wall to blame? Keeper at fault? Rice's free-kicks analysed\" - that shows that your opinion was not \"fucking crazy\".\nhttps://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckg22y9rz96o\n65 Posted 09/04/2025 at 18:54:23\nI don't know what the best ways to stop free kicks are. Perhaps the Pejic and Darracott method of covering the goal posts are, or another method. Certainly the one employed by Real Madrid didn't work.\nYou know your football, Tony.\n66 Posted 09/04/2025 at 19:09:44\nI'm not having that.\n'kin Hell Tony (A), you even explained to me what all those strange areas are south of The Rocket on Queen's Drive with their quaint names, Knotty Ash etc. Left turn for the M62 is the furthest south I've been, although we did go to Knowsley Safari Park when I was a kid. Might we have gone through say Childwall on the way?\n67 Posted 09/04/2025 at 19:27:49\nI doubt you'd have gone as far south as Childwall. Either East Lancs and drop down or through Huyton.\nThere is nothing quaint about Speke!! Woolton is nice though.\n68 Posted 09/04/2025 at 19:29:48\n69 Posted 09/04/2025 at 19:38:58\n70 Posted 09/04/2025 at 19:51:14\n71 Posted 09/04/2025 at 19:52:17\n72 Posted 09/04/2025 at 19:56:05\nIn up-and-coming Halifax, the Piece Hall hosts an Echo & the Bunnymen/Mick Head double header in August.\n73 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:02:03\nRotherham. Only been past it on the train, Liam. It looks grim, especially if it's raining. Just the right sort of place for knobheads who enjoy attacking asylum seekers' \"hotels\".\nAnd then there is Steve Rotherham.\n74 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:03:42\nhttps://www.thepiecehall.co.uk/event/echo-the-bunnymen/\n75 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:09:40\nAnyone want Villa to lose?\n76 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:22:57\nI doubt you would have gone past Childwall to go to Knowsley Safari Park, because it is a couple of minutes drive, going south from The Rocket, and coming from Crosby, my guess is that the M57 would be the much preferred route; otherwise, it would have been that left turn onto M62.\nI think growing up in Liverpool, a place where football means so much to so many of us, definitely made me want to understand the beautiful game, John, and my mate once told me a story of what Alan Stubbs allegedly said to Graeme Jones when he was working at Everton with Roberto Martinez, which I think sums up what scousers are like.\nJones apparently said they would never abandon their principles, and Stubbs replied that, although they might not abandon their principles, they would never be able to kid the Everton crowd, because our ex-captain's opinion was that at least 15/20% of the Everton crowd would be, or would have once been good footballers, and at least 5% of the crowd would have it in them to be good managers.\nI have often wondered how close to the truth Stubbs actually was with this assessment, especially when you see a few hitting the crossbar during the half-time entertainment at Goodison Park!\n77 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:23:52\n\"The free kick is miles out but Aston Villa have a two man wall and now they are scrapping the wall\".\n78 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:27:14\n79 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:28:38\n80 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:31:53\n81 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:36:30\n82 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:36:36\n83 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:40:50\nI thought Forest had it to a T, under Clough, and they have also impressed me a few times this season, by being so clinical on the counter?\n84 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:41:07\n85 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:42:08\n86 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:47:35\n87 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:48:44\nForest have both atm in Gibbs-White, Elanga and Hudson-Odoi.\nClough's Forest had John Robertson who was one the best players I ever saw at running with the ball and making chances out of very little.\n88 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:53:16\n89 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:54:26\n90 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:55:22\n91 Posted 09/04/2025 at 20:57:58\nI think Chelsea were very good at that type of football under Mourinho.\n92 Posted 09/04/2025 at 21:01:45\n93 Posted 09/04/2025 at 21:04:02\nThe majority of football matches are risk free pass-athons. Slow and without excitement.\nThis game is a good game to watch tbf.\n94 Posted 09/04/2025 at 21:07:34\nI love watching skill, I love watching teams play with infectious energy, but I believe the biggest requirement in top level sport, has got to be discipline?\n95 Posted 09/04/2025 at 21:08:29\n96 Posted 09/04/2025 at 21:08:57\n97 Posted 09/04/2025 at 21:09:01\n98 Posted 09/04/2025 at 21:10:14\n99 Posted 09/04/2025 at 21:11:53\n100 Posted 09/04/2025 at 21:14:06\n101 Posted 09/04/2025 at 21:17:33\n102 Posted 09/04/2025 at 21:18:55\nPickford or Martinez?\n103 Posted 09/04/2025 at 21:22:54\n104 Posted 09/04/2025 at 21:25:48\nBarcelona's keeper as composed on the ball as any of our midfielders.\nLewandowski. 36, if you could afford the wages you would surely??\n105 Posted 09/04/2025 at 21:26:44\nHow's the Villa game?\n106 Posted 09/04/2025 at 21:27:26\n107 Posted 09/04/2025 at 21:36:35\n108 Posted 09/04/2025 at 21:52:04\n109 Posted 09/04/2025 at 21:54:48\n110 Posted 09/04/2025 at 22:02:25\n111 Posted 09/04/2025 at 22:08:47\nPSG have the players well capable of hitting Villa on the counter attack at Villa Park and I fancy one or two PSG goals next week.\n112 Posted 09/04/2025 at 22:09:36\nBut really, on paper, and without giving it the commentator's kiss of death, the prospect of a PSG v Barcelona final looks mouthwatering for the neutral.\nI'm off to watch Iliman Ndiaye, My Story. More likely I'll have to finish it, as I'll fall asleep!\n113 Posted 09/04/2025 at 22:49:00\nSemis looking so far like PSG/Gooners and Barca/Inter.\n114 Posted 10/04/2025 at 08:26:20\nFor the purists, I think most would like to see a PSG v Barcelona final.\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
