  "body_text": "Mikel Arteta was back in front of the media at Sobha Realty Training Centre for his pre-Chelsea press conference on Friday.\nOur manager was asked all about Myles Lewis-Skelly’s first call-up to the England national team and more.\nHere’s what he had to say on the following subjects.\non Myles Lewis-Skelly’s first England call-up:\nVery proud. Very proud of him. It's a huge moment for him and for the club as well. One of our graduates getting the call for England, it's a massive thing, so very happy.\non if he’s been involved with Thomas Tuchel:\nNo, but I'm sure that that will be the case, and Thomas is a top coach. I know a few people around him and the set-up in England, and I have no doubt that they will do the right thing with him.\non Ben White’s involvement with England:\nYeah, well, I heard that there have been some positive conversations around it, so I imagine it will be about timing more than anything else, especially with the amount of time that he’s been out with injury.\non Ethan Nwaneri potentially getting called up in the future and if Mikel takes pride in their journeys:\nYeah, I think we all do because obviously we are involved in their development and we know that it's one of the biggest dreams that you can achieve as a football player and a really proud moment, so being part of that obviously is a great thing to do.\non if it’s important to have an English core in our side:\nVery important. I think culturally, I think because of our history and we're an English club, to have that DNA that represents us as a club and then having a lot of academy players as well, I think it's something very, very positive, so very proud of it.\non if there’s an update on Bukayo Saka’s injury:\nNo, he's getting closer, he's stepping up and making very good progress I would say.\non having Real Madrid coming up in the Champions League:\nQuite a fascinating draw. I think we’re going to play against the club with the biggest and most history in the competition and I'm very excited to play against them but before that we'll have to have big matches in the Premier League.\non beating Chelsea 5-0 last year:\nI think it's going to be a very different game. I think the way they develop as a team as well is very impressive, what they've done on the coaching staff, the amount of talent that they have in the squad. So yes, a really tough match but we had our best of luck, a big chance for us to win the game.\non Raheem Sterling not being involved against his parent club this weekend:\nI think so but it's what it is, we knew about that. He played well, he was contributing to the attacking goals that we scored as well so very good. That's what we need, players in good form, in good spirit, good confidence and certainly that performance is going to help him.\non what this season has been like for Mikel mentally:\nYes, day by day. Try to surround yourself with the right people that have the right expertise and can advise you to make the right decision. After that, unpredictability is a big factor in this industry and you have to adapt to it. You can have an understanding of our way of doing things and for sure things will happen and you're going to have to adapt but go into the next day.\non how Ben White can help the squad during the rest of the season:\nVery much. He's been now involved for the last two weeks almost and he's not reacting so that's very positive and we know. Ben is a really important player for us, he brings something very different to the team dynamic and that's ready to happen.\non what to expect from this weekend’s game against Chelsea:\nWell, let's see. I think two teams that want to be very dominant in the way of playing are very aggressive on the high press and the way we have to have the ball. A lot of individual quality on that pitch so it's about imposing what you want and the direction that you want to take the game and keep them very far from their strengths. I think that's going to be a key thing as well.\non the importance of having a British core at the club:\nI think that's great. I think it attaches people to the football club, it makes them proud. I think everybody wants to see academy players and English players driving and being the face of the football club. I think it's really important and I think it has to happen organically, you can't force it, especially with those two. Now it's really good news because they are set to be where they are, they are doing great and there's a bright future ahead of them.\non if we have more youngsters coming up behind Ethan and Myles:\nHopefully there are many more but again it's something that time will tell. As Gary used the word, fast-tracking players. If they are good enough there's no problem with that but at the same time they really have to earn it to play at this level.\non if it’s important for Myles and Ethan to develop individually:\nYeah, any comparison there I don't think is right. I think they have a very similar pathway because obviously they played so many years together but after that they're going to have different moments and each career will be unique and individual for them and they're going to have to earn it and what one does is not going to reflect or affect the other one in a positive or negative way so that needs to be totally independent. It's great, it's a luxury to have someone that you spend so much time, trust and love next to you on that journey, use it in that way, that's it and the rest is a way away.\non if Mikel Merino is still a centre-forward option for us now Gabriel Martinelli is back:\nNow we have more options but it's true that we have to really manage the load and he's been a little bit ahead of schedule and that's what we didn't want to take and we don't want to take anymore because we've been loading in with more minutes.\non if Mikel has felt like a parental figure to Ethan and Myles:\nThey are almost the age of my oldest son so yeah, just for that factor I can see a lot of similarities but both of them, they have a great family, a great environment and they are in charge of that part of the education. Obviously we have a big responsibility and a lot of things that are related to that as well but they are in good hands. We are here just to support and guide them in many other aspects and yeah, if they need something they know that they can open the door and have that conversation.\non if he has had the chance to speak to Myles since his call-up:\nYeah, I had and we all had and we were all really, really happy because it's a really nice story and a story that gives a lot of hope to a lot of young players and that in six, seven months your career can change dramatically, drastically for the good. So it's something for people to be inspired by. I think it hasn't happened because he was lucky. I think he pushed for every chance to happen and the way he's done it.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
