And Haris Zeb got involved for Auckland City FC straight away, whipping a delivery into the box that Bevan couldn’t quite head towards goal.\nBevan turned provider soon after, only for Manickum to poke an effort just wide of the left post from close range.\nThe nail in the coffin finally came in the fourth minute of injury-time, when Tiga failed to deal with a delivery into the box from Matt Ellis, allowing Zeb to volley the ball into the top of the net from close range for City’s second goal.\nAuckland City FC will now look to wrap up top spot in Group A when they face Rewa FC on the final matchday, whilst Tiga Sport have a crucial clash with AS Pirae to decide who will join the Navy Blues in the semi-finals.\nAuckland City FC 2 (Dylan MANICKUM 24’, Haris ZEB 90+4′)\nAS Tiga Sport 0\nHT 1-0\nContent Sourced from scoop.co.nz\nOriginal url",
