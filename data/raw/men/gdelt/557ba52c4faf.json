Mataks took full advantage with the extra player and Ellis Mana tapped in his second of the game before Suva FC were able to replace Chand.\nJunior Mana scored his second to leave the Fijian side reeling before Ellis Mana completed his hat-trick in the closing stages.\nThe result guarantees a Mataks FC final on Sunday against New Caledonian side AS PTT regardless of the result of tomorrow’s final two round robin matches.\nMataks FC knew a win would secure a place in the final with a game to spare and they started the match like they meant business.\nJunior Mana fired the Solomon Islands team in front in the fifth minute after a nice one two with Billy Afi.\nThe goal sparked an almost immediate response from the Fijian champions. National captain Filipe Baravilala, usually a rock at the back, pushed forward and caused trouble for the Mataks defence.\nIn the 11th minute Suva FC captain Rajneel Singh fired home from an acute angle to level the scores. Both sides had a couple of half chances but there was no further scoring in the half.\nMataks started the second half as they did the first and should have taken the lead in the second minute when Billy Afi missed a tap in at the far post.\nThey didn’t have to wait long to take the lead though with Ellis Mana firing home a minute later.\nThe red card a few minutes later effectively sealed the outcome.\nSUVA FC 1 (Rajneel SINGH 11’)\nMATAKS FC 5 (Junior MANA 5’28’ Ellis MANA 23’27 38’)\nHT 1-1\nUNV FC defeat gallant Veitongo FC and will playoff for third\nVanuatu’s UNV FC completed their round robin campaign with a hard fought 3-1 win over Tonga’s Veitongo FC to round out Match Day four at the ‘Arene du Sud’ in Paita, Noumea.\nUNV FC will have the day off on Saturday before meeting Suva FC in the third and fourth place playoff on Sunday.\nThe Tongans were vastly improved from their first two matches which they lost 11-2 and 7-0 to AS PTT and Suva FC respectively.\nManu Tualau’s side were happy to concede possession and sit deep in the first spell and looked for opportunities to counter when UNV FC turned over the ball. UNV FC struggled to penetrate the well organised Veitongo FC defence and when they did get through, Semisi Otukolo in goal made some telling saves.\nThe breakthrough seemed inevitable though and came in the 14th minute through a powerful strike from Lucas Sarvanu.\nVeitongo FC equalised four minutes into the second half when captain Hemaloto Polovili lifted a ball over the top of the defence and Sione Kefu flicked the ball past Sterry Tor in the UNV FC goal. Veitongo FC grew in confidence and twice Tor was called on to make quality saves to deny the underdogs taking the lead.\nThen in the 31st minute Sarvanu restored UNV FC’s lead with a sweetly time right footed shot that left Otukolo with no chance. Captain Rene Bahormal made the game safe four minutes later before Jayson Timatua added a fourth a couple of minutes before the end.\nVeitongo FC play their final match of the tournament against Mataks FC tomorrow.\nUNV FC 4 (Lucas SARVANU 14’ 31’ Rene BAHORMAL 35’ Jayson TIMATUA 38′)\nVeitongo FC 1 (Sione KEFU 24’)\nHT: 1-0\nContent Sourced from scoop.co.nz\nOriginal url",
