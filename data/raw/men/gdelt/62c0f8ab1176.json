  "body_text": "Toni Kroos has offered high praise for Arda Güler in an interview with Sport1, sharing thoughtful insights into the young Turkish talent’s growing role at Real Madrid, while also providing an update on his own post-retirement activities.\nToni Kroos on Arda Güler: “He Deserves His Minutes — He Can Mark an Era at Real Madrid”\nKroos also explains why Güler is different than him\nThe German legend, who retired at the end of the 2023–24 season after a decade of dominance at the Bernabéu, expressed genuine admiration for Güler’s progress and potential:\n“I’m happy that Arda Güler is getting significantly more playing time this year for the first time, because he deserves it for his footballing quality, and he’s a player we can count on for the future.”\nKroos emphasized that while comparisons between the two are inevitable, Güler is a very different type of player:\n“Arda is also a different player than me. His best position is much more attacking than mine, so he’s not at all my successor. But overall I’m happy because he’s a good guy. I’ve played with him. He has a very delicate touch, which he has already used very effectively at Real Madrid this season.”\nThe former midfield metronome also urged patience and continuity for Güler’s development, stressing that consistent minutes are key to fulfilling his vast potential:\n“That’s why I hope he continues to get regular playing time, because it’s the only way to improve. I’m sure that then he’ll be able to leave his mark on Real Madrid for many years to come.”\nBeyond his reflections on Madrid’s rising star, Kroos also spoke about life after football. Far from idle, he remains heavily involved in youth development and charity work:\n“Just because you hear less from me doesn’t mean I’m idle. A lot is happening. I work daily at my academy in Madrid, where I personally coach two teams. Also, my foundation celebrated its tenth anniversary with a big event in Düsseldorf, which I was able to perfectly combine with the Icon League.”",
