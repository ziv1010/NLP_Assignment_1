It follows the shocking riots that gripped Paris after PSG's victory in the Champions League at the weekend, which left two dead and hundreds injured.\nDistressing footage from the French capital showed frightened women cowering inside their cars as mobs of out-of-control football fans smashed windows and set fire to nearby vehicles. And in Britain, a report released last month cautioned that authorities must be much swifter in tackling misinformation on social media to avoid a repeat of last year's riots, which followed the murders of three young girls at a dance class in Southport.\nWriting in in the latest issue of Military Strategy Magazine, Professor Betz argued that governments across the Western world have been \"losing the ability to peacefully manage multicultural societies\", leaving them open to mass disorder and potential civil war\". He added: \"The initial result is an accelerating descent of multiple major cities into marginally ‘feral’ status\".\nIn another part of the essay, Professor Betz predicted that the \"countries that are most likely to experience the outbreak of violent civil conflict are Britain and France\" - but said that other parts of Europe and the United States could also be at risk\n\"It must be assumed that if civil war breaks out in one place it is likely to spread elsewhere\", he added.\nHundreds arrested after deadly PSG riots\nClashes between police and supporters on Saturday began long before PSG's thumping 5-0 victory over Inter Milan had even finished, with officers deploying a water cannon on the Champs-Elysees at half-time.\nUgly scenes later in the night saw drivers attacked in their cars, vehicles torched and shops looted, with over 200 people injured and two killed in gatherings connected to the post-match celebrations.\nA 17-year-old boy was stabbed to death in the western city of Dax during a street party after the final, the national police service said, and in Paris, a man in his 20s was killed when his scooter was hit by a car during PSG celebrations.\nA police officer was also hit accidentally by fireworks at a PSG fan gathering in northwest France, and placed in an artificial coma because of severe eye injuries. More than 500 people were arrested by police in connection with the disorder.\nReacting to the initial reports of rioting Saturday night, France's Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau labelled the rioters \"barbarians\" and not \"true PSG fans\", adding: \"It is unbearable that it is not possible to party without fearing the savagery of a minority of thugs who respect nothing.\"\nSmaller clashes between gangs of youths and police continued in the centre of Paris on Sunday.",
