But now, sorting out their financials will be key for a deal to materialise.\nThis essentially means player sales are needed for United to be able to afford the 27-year-old, who would cost around €70 million this summer.\n“Then, for Man United, we have to see financially how they can make it happen, because with Champions League football, I’m 99% convinced that they were going to close the Gyökeres deal quite quick. I think that was the feeling.\n“Then, no Champions League football, they lost the [Europa League] final in Bilbao, and so it’s more complicated financially. But, for Viktor Gyökeres, Man United called again, so let’s see if they will be able to make it happen, but there were new contacts with the agents of the player.”\nNew meetings took place\nThis tallies with what Sky have also reported, with United in touch with the the Portuguese club through intermediaries.\nAll in all, these reports seem to point towards the Sweden international being United’s top choice to replace Rasmus Hojlund up front, who is most likely Inter Milan-bound.\nRomano also revealed that Juventus are also interested in the Sporting striker while Al-Hilal of Saudi Arabia are also lurking.\nIt will be interesting to see where Gyokeres lands up eventually. United fans will be hoping he is coming to Old Trafford, but United are also monitoring Victor Osimhen should things not pan out with Viktor Gyokeres.\nFeature image Gualter Fatia via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
