My team and I are already looking forward to starting work and we are confident in our ability to do what is necessary to prepare the team for the upcoming season.”\nOwner Mitch Goldhar said “Robbie brings with him the mentality, character, energy and the focus of a winner, qualities that he demonstrated everywhere he played. These characteristics combined with the ambitions to succeed.”\nKeane’s storied career saw him bag over 100 goals in the Premier League, win the MLS league alongside David Beckham in 2011 and perhaps most famously secured a dramatic last-minute goal against Germany at the 2002 World Cup.\nKeane scored 68 goals in 146 games for Ireland, bursting onto the scene in 1998 as the star of Ireland’s “golden generation” which contained the likes of Damien Duff and Shay Given, and playing his last game in Ireland in 2016.\nMaccabi Tel Aviv will find themselves in the Europa Conference League qualifiers next month to last season’s third place league finish, with the side previously making the group stages of the Champions League in 2015.",
