I feel like I am capable of still playing,” he added, speaking in Spanish. “But as this chapter closes, we'll see what's possible. I want to finish my career on the pitch playing, and this is what I'm hoping to do.\"\nNews reports suggested a stint in the Middle East, but with no details about clubs.\n“It's a very emotional day after so many years,\" he said. “I tried to give my best on and off the pitch. I am very proud of that.”\nAfter finishing his long tenure at Barcelona, Iniesta joined the Japanese club in 2018 on a three-year deal, and prolonged his stay with a two-year extension. News reports indicate his reason for leaving is because he wants more playing time.\nIniesta just turned 39 and made the announcement at a club news conference in the western city of Kobe.\nHis last game for the club is expected to be at home on July 1, a farewell to fans. Vissel Kobe is leading the J-League standings after 14 rounds.\nIt was Iniesta who scored the winning goal in extra time in the 116th minute of the 2010 World Cup in a 1-0 victory over the Netherlands for Spain's only World Cup title.\nThe veteran midfielder described going to Japan as one of the best decisions of his life. He repeatedly said “thank you” to the club, the fans, and to his fellow players.\n“I was made to feel welcome here from the first day,” he said.\n___\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",
