It was actually easy because, from a player's perspective, all you had to do was go in every day and be better than the player I was competing with, get on the pitch and be better than the player I was competing with and win the game.\n\"But these lads are coming in to a club which is similar in the sense that they're spending a lot of money and bringing in new players, but the level of expectation from the fans... there's no bedding-in time. We actually didn't need bedding-in time, we finished second in our first season, semi-final of the Champions League. We didn't win anything, but that was seen as successful.\n\"Fast-forward that season to maybe five years ago, finishing second and not winning a trophy at Chelsea was enough to get the manager the sack.\"\nWith the landscape at Stamford Bridge significantly altered these days, Cole challenged everyone involved, including under-fire manager Graham Potter, to prove their ability to cope with the situation.\n\"These boys are in a pressure cooker and there's no stability around them,\" Cole continued. \"Graham Potter and the people around him, they have to find a way of settling everything down in a storm effectively.\n\"In that, it's down to the players ultimately. If I was the manager, I'd be saying: 'Which one of you lot are going to show me you need to have that shirt for the next game? You're all great players, go and show me on a day-to-day basis'.\n\"Which one of these players, and they're all top players, are going to emerge and be the stars of the next generation?\"",
