After picking up just seven points from their first six league games, Gian Piero Gasperini’s side caught fire with a run of three straight wins, scoring 10 and conceding just once.\nRetegui’s hat-trick against former employers Genoa before the international break was followed by goals against both Belgium and Israel for the Azzurri in the Nations League, before he scored one and set up another at the weekend in Venice.\nThat form has excited and delighted leading figures from across the world of calcio, not least national team boss Luciano Spalletti.\n‘He’s a great player but also a calm guy. He’s lethal inside the box and has learned to work more with the team,’ Spalletti said. ‘He will become a top player…he’s perfect.’\nPaolo Condò, a leading pundit and journalist, was even more impressed by Retegui’s impact in the Azzurri blue.\n‘The last time Italy has been so completely satisfied by its centre-forward was almost 20 years ago with Luca Toni,’ he wrote in La Repubblica. High praise, indeed. But were it not for a conversation between Juan Sebastian Veron and Roberto Mancini, Retegui could easily have not ended up in Italy at all.\nThe former Lazio team-mates’ chat in early 2023, while Mancini was still Azzurri boss, led to the surprise call-up of the striker then on loan at Argentinian club Tigre from Boca Juniors.\nRetegui, eligible for the Azzurri due to his Italian grandfather, arrived on the peninsula as a complete unknown with limited Italian language skills, but he immediately did his talking on the pitch by scoring against England on his debut and Malta a few days later.\nStill, there were sceptics. Not because of his roots — Italians are no strangers to the concept of the oriundo, foreign-born players representing the national team, with Jorginho, Thiago Motta and World Cup winner Mauro Camoranesi all notable examples.\nArgentina-born Retegui has six goals in 16 appearances for Italy\nBut Retegui had to silence doubters who could not fathom how a player aged almost 24, who had never left Argentinian club football, could be the answer to their attacking problems.\nSince then, he has shown why he could be. A move to Genoa last summer got Retegui scoring on the Serie A stage, while his October double took his tally to a commendable six goals in 16 caps — even if he failed to deliver one at Euro 2024.\nNine goals at Genoa were enough to earn him a move to Atalanta, and he is now seen as a fixture rather than an outsider in Italy.\nPerhaps it was in the blood all along. Retegui’s father Carlos was a successful athlete, coaching Argentina’s field hockey team to Olympic gold in 2016 after appearing at the Games for the team three times as a player.\nAnd he has made it clear there is no divided loyalty in the Retegui household.\nRetegui's penalty is saved by Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya during September's 0-0 draw\n‘Mateo feels very appreciated by Spalletti and he’s very grateful to everyone,’ said Carlos Retegui. ‘He is proud to play for the Italian national team. It is an eternal glory to wear the Azzurri shirt.’\nQuick, strong, dangerous in the air and capable of deft finishes, Retegui has devastated defences at domestic and international level this season.\nBut there is one stage on which he’s yet to shine: the Champions League.\nThis is the 25-year-old’s first experience of European football’s flagship competition, and he had a penalty saved in a 0-0 draw with Arsenal before failing to score from the bench in a 3-0 victory over Shakhtar Donetsk.\nThe visit of Celtic, therefore, will bring not just hope but expectation that Italy’s No 9 can net his first Champions League goal on Wednesday night.\nCeltic’s woeful away form in Europe hasn’t gone unnoticed in Italy. Leading sports paper Gazzetta dello Sport last week described them as ‘timid’ and as dangerous as ‘domestic cats’ when they play outside of Glasgow.\nAfter an inconsistent start, La Dea (The Goddess) are playing with swagger and cohesion domestically and in Europe.\nThe thumping win over Shakhtar came after a stalemate with Arsenal that may well have been a win had it not been for David Raya’s spectacular double-save on a Retegui penalty and rebound.\nAtalanta might have lost the element of surprise since Pep Guardiola compared facing them to ‘going to the dentist’ back in 2019 when they made their Champions League bow, but that doesn’t make them any easier to deal with.\nAtalanta beat Leverkusen in Dublin to lift the Europa League last May\nLast year’s stunning Europa League victory, where an Ademola Lookman hat-trick in the final saw them become the first team to beat Bayer Leverkusen all season, finally brought Gasperini the first trophy of his reign at the club after the pain of three Coppa Italia final defeats.\nIt also earned the club its first-ever Ballon d’Or nomination, with Lookman making the 30-man shortlist thanks to his heroics in Dublin and his sterling efforts in helping Nigeria reach the Africa Cup of Nations final.\nUnder Gasperini, historic achievements have become the norm.\nBut perhaps the most significant this year will be the completion of a five-and-a-half year, 100 million euro stadium renovation that was completed just in time for Arsenal’s visit.\nThe travelling Celtic supporters will be only the fifth set of away fans to visit the shiny new arena, one that sets Atalanta apart from most of their domestic rivals as one of just three Serie A clubs who own their own ground, alongside Juventus and Udinese.\nOn the pitch, they continue to dish out the dental treatment year-on-year despite regular squad reboots.\nThis summer, 10 new players joined and influential midfielder Teun Koopmeiners departed for Juventus, but Gasperini’s proactive philosophy has continued unabated. Atalanta are the leading scorers in Serie A and their 18 goals have been shared between nine different players.\nThe intensity of their approach impressed England star Declan Rice when Arsenal visited Bergamo earlier in the campaign.\n‘They are European champions. They have had the same manager for nine years, playing man-to-man all over the pitch,’ Rice said.\n‘They are a really tough team to crack; they follow you all over the pitch.’\nWith Real Madrid set to visit Bergamo in December and a trip to Barcelona to come in January, Atalanta will view the visit of Celtic as a must-win game.\nThey are gathering momentum now. Fabio Capello recently described Gasperini as a coach whose team ‘starts slowly and then accelerates’ adding that ‘I have no doubt he will do it again this time’.\nHe appears to be right. But for Celtic, stopping Retegui could be the key to tripping up the Goddess before she reaches top speed.\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Glamorous Olympic skating star masterfully avoids disaster\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein",
