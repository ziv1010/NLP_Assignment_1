This guy is a machine. He is still playing and still scoring goals,” Martins said.\n“Playing in so many countries is very, very difficult to do. People just love Messi for the fact that he is calm, and they think he is not arrogant.\n“But as a footballer, sometimes you need to be a little arrogant to push yourself,” he added.\nMartins faced Messi and Ronaldo four times in his career.\nThe retired footballer faced Messi during Rubin Kazan’s tie with Barcelona in the 2010/11 UEFA Champions League group stage.\nHe played against Ronaldo, a former Manchester United forward, in the Premier League during his time at Newcastle United.",
