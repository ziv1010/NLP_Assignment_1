He will miss Premier League matches against Brighton, Everton and Nottingham Forest.\nLiverpool attacker Diogo Jota will also miss Sunday's trip to Brighton as he serves a one-match ban following his dismissal for two yellow cards against Tottenham.\nLuis Enrique: Newcastle atmosphere will test PSG mettle\nParis Saint-Germain head coach Luis Enrique believes tomorrow night's clash with Newcastle United will be a chance to test the mettle of his side amid a “spectacular” atmosphere at St James' Park.\nNewcastle will host Champions League football in their home stadium for the first time in more than 20 years tomorrow night, when they take to the field against PSG.\nAnd while they were the fourth seed to be drawn in their four-team group, which also includes Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan, Luis Enrique is not underestimating the scale of the challenge and played up Newcastle's chances of success in the competition.\n“Nobody in Europe or the world can say why Newcastle aren't one of the favourites get through the group and go far in this competition, given their level of individual quality and how they play as a team,” he said during his pre-match press conference on Tuesday.\n“They are a team in the fourth pot that nobody wanted (to draw) because of what they showed last season. We will need manage this opportunity to play in a hostile atmosphere — in football terms.\n”But it is a wonderful experience, and a chance to see what PSG are made of. I'm looking forward to it. I am jealous of our players who were going to get to enjoy that atmosphere.“\nDefender Lucas Hernandez will be one of those to sample the St James' Park furnace and he believes PSG will need to be ”focused, aggressive and to concentrate on our game“ to secure a result.\nHis brother, Theo Hernandez, has already faced Newcastle in the group stages this season, starting AC Milan's 0-0 draw with Eddie Howe's side in the San Siro. Lucas Hernandez revealed he spoke to him about what to expect.\n”They were away from home, so it was a different game, but Newcastle are a very solid team defensively,“ Lucas Hernandez said. ”My brother told me (Milan) had lots of chances, but if you don't take them in the Champions League it becomes harder. They are solid with players who can attack are fast on the counter. That was the main thing my brother said to me.“\nSouthend United owner Ron Martin reaches agreement to sell club to consortium\nSouthend United owner Ron Martin has reached an agreement to sell the club to a consortium led by businessman Justin Rees the club confirmed in a statement.\nThe Athletic previously reported that positive talks had taken place between the parties in the past week, with significant movement towards a takeover, and that despite time running out, there was a genuine belief that a deal could be completed ahead of Wednesday’s deadline.\nThe National League side now look set to be under new ownership in the near future confirming in the statement that a completion date of November 1 is being worked towards.\nThe statement read: “We can confirm that an agreement for the sale of the Club has been reached with a consortium led by Justin Rees. Everyone is working towards a completion date of 1 November 2023, that is when the consortium will formally take control of the Club.\n“The collaborative approach to agreeing this deal would not have been possible without the support of creditors and the assistance from the Leader of Southend City Council.\n“We recognise that this has been a stressful time for all associated with the Club. We would like to thank our staff for their incredible loyalty and also thank all our stakeholders for their patience.”\nFull story below\nNacho to miss three matches after Girona red card\nReal Madrid defender Nacho Fernandez will miss the next three matches after his red card against Girona.\nThe Spain international centre-back was sent off after a heavy challenge on Portu, which resulted in the Girona winger having to be taken from the field of play on a stretcher.\nReal Madrid will appeal the decision but he is now due to miss matches against Osasuna, Sevilla and the Clasico against Barcelona.\nHe apologised to Portu after the game.\nHe wrote on Instagram: “I want to apologise to Portu for an unintentional action in the match. Today and throughout my career I have never intended to hurt anyone. Hopefully you can recover well and quickly.”\nTrippier relishing challenge against 'best in the world' Mbappe\nKieran Trippier is looking forward to coming up against Kylian Mbappe when Newcastle United take on Paris Saint Germain in the Champions League tomorrow evening.\nNewcastle drew their opening group stage game against AC Milan 0-0 last month, while PSG secured an opening-day victory beating Dortmund 2-0 with Mbappe scoring the first goal of the game.\nAhead of the game at St James' Park, Trippier praised the France international, whom he labelled \"one of the best in the world\" — and revealed that his son is a huge fan of the 24-year-old.\nTrippier said: \"These are the levels you want to play at, playing the best players, the best teams. We need to recognise Mbappe is one of the best in the world, but they have quality all over the pitch. But we can’t just focus on them, because on our day I think we can hurt anyone.\n\"I played against him (Mbappe) during his debut game for Monaco at Tottenham, and for England on my debut quite a few years ago. He’s a fantastic player. You want to play against the best players in the world.\n\"I was having banter with him (his son) last night. He wanted to walk out with him instead of me, it was something I wasn’t really happy with. He’s always watching his clips on YouTube. I told him, if you walk out with him, don't look at me in the tunnel.\"\nNewcastle manager Eddie Howe confirmed that Callum Wilson and Joelinton will miss the game due to hamstring injuries, as well Sven Botman, who is ruled out with a knee issue.\nHe said: \"Wilson, we think, won't make the game tomorrow. He's going to be close but as it stands he won't.\n\"Joelinton is in a similar position where he's close so we'll make a late check on him. Botman is out and won't play. (Sando) Tonali is fine.\"\nToney scores for Brentford in behind-closed-doors game\nIvan Toney scored in a behind-closed-doors game for Brentford on Tuesday in what was his first appearance for the club since his ban for breaching betting rules.\nToney played 61 minutes against Italian side Como and netted a second-half goal in a 2-2 draw, lifting the ball over the goalkeeper after being played in.\nThe striker received an eight-month ban from playing competitive football in May after he admitted to 232 breaches of the Football Association’s betting rules. The 27-year-old was also banned from training for four months and fined £50,000.\nBut he returned to training on Monday, September 18 and stepped up his comeback preparations by playing just over an hour on Tuesday afternoon, before being replaced by Nathan Young-Coombes.\nFirst-team players Zanka, Saman Ghoddos, Frank Onyeka, Yehor Yarmoliuk and Neal Maupay were also involved in the friendly game.\nToney cannot appear for Brentford in an official competition until January 17.\nThe first game he will be eligible for is Brentford’s trip to Tottenham Hotspur on January 30, but that could change depending on the rescheduling of other games, the Premier League’s winter break and Brentford’s progress in the FA Cup.\nChilwell set to be out for months\nChelsea and England defender Ben Chilwell is expected to be out for months rather than weeks with a hamstring injury.\nChilwell, 26, suffered the injury in the latter stages of Chelsea's Carabao Cup win over Brighton & Hove Albion last Wednesday.\nMauricio Pochettino admitted that the injury \"does not look good\" and although Chelsea have not put an exact timeframe on the recovery themselves, it is feared he will be out for some time.\n\"I think it is bad news,\" Pochettino said on Friday. \"The doctor told me it is not a good thing, but we need to assess in the next few days and we will see the period he is going to be out.\n\"But it does not look good. It (the injury) was in the last minute of the game. Yes, we are really sad about the news.\"\nChilwell injured the same hamstring last November and missed the World Cup in Qatar as a result. He was sidelined for three months on that occasion before returning in February.\n'And the Oscar goes to...': Guardiola wants officials to 'step back'\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola believes referees and video assistant referees should \"step back\" and \"be more humble\" in the wake of the Liverpool VAR controversy.\nThe fallout continues after a VAR error on Sunday that saw a Luis Diaz goal against Tottenham incorrectly ruled out.\nVAR Darren England and assistant VAR Dan Cook have been stood down for this weekend's fixtures after what referees' body PGMOL called a “significant human error,” while Liverpool have requested to receive the audio of the exchange between referee Simon Hooper and those in the VAR room at Stockley Park.\nAsked about the incident ahead of City's Champions League trip to RB Leipzig on Wednesday, Guardiola suggested that the game's focus had drifted too much from the players on the field.\nHe said: \"They will have to find (a way) for the main role to be played by the players and the game itself, in all the countries not just here.\n\"The referees and VAR are the leading roles. 'And the Oscar goes to… '\n\"They have to make a step back. It’s the players, and sometimes there are games where sometimes just being more humble and doing what they have to do, they will do it better. They will do it better.\"\nGuardiola said he felt that VAR had impacted the accountability of referees and empathised with Liverpool.\nHe added: \"It changed the job of the referees because now they don't make the decisions, the important decisions are made by VAR. But then if VAR makes a mistake you have a problem.\n\"I understand completely how upset Liverpool in this case must be. The bosses of the referees will decide what we have to do and we will follow them.\"\nMan City team news: Bernardo, Stones boost\nBernardo Silva and John Stones have been included in Manchester City's travelling squad to face RB Leipzig in the Champions League on Wednesday.\nBernardo has been missing since picking up a knock in last month's win over Red Star Belgrade, while Stones has not started since the Community Shield due to a muscular problem.\nBut manager Pep Guardiola, whose side are looking to bounce back from defeats to Newcastle and Wolves in the Carabao Cup and Premier League respectively, is set for a boost ahead of the game in Germany — and an anticipated league clash with Arsenal on Sunday.\nGuardiola told reporters on Tuesday: \"They feel better, Bernardo better than John. They have both travelled and we will decide tomorrow. We're really happy they're back.\"\nICYMI: Antony in contention for Man Utd\nAntony is in contention to be included in Manchester United’s squad for the Champions League match with Galatasaray this evening.\nThe Brazil international, 23, returned to training on Saturday for the first time since being given a leave absence on September 10 following allegations of assault.\nHe remains under investigation after his former partner Gabriela Cavallin alleged he assaulted her on separate occasions between June 2022 and May this year.\nHe denies all allegations against him.\nManager Erik ten Hag said on Monday: “Antony will be in consideration,” he said. “(Sunday) was his first time back in team training, then we make a decision.”\nICYMI: Partey could return for Arsenal\nArsenal midfielder Thomas Partey could return from injury against Lens in the Champions League on tonight.\nThe Ghana international hasn't played since August with a groin injury but trained on Monday and was part of the travelling party to France.\nManager Mikel Arteta said ahead of the game: \"He’s progressed really well in the last two weeks and he managed to train in the last two or three days with the team and that’s great news for us obviously.\n\"He’s a big player and we know what he brings to the team. He knows exactly what we need and with the injuries we had to other players in midfield and at the back he complements us in a great way and gives us options. So it’s great to have him back again.\"\nPressed on whether he needs to play against Lens to have a chance of being involved against Manchester City this weekend, he added: \"I don’t know. I think his progression in the last week has been very good. He might have some exposure tomorrow depending how the game goes.\"\nBukayo Saka, who limped off in the latter stages of his side's 4-0 victory over Bournemouth on Sunday, also travelled.\nGabriel Martinelli did not, however, and remains sidelined with a hamstring injury.\nLiverpool now have the audio - what do they hope to achieve after VAR row?\nAlmost 72 hours after Liverpool’s contentious defeat by Tottenham and the fallout rumbles on.\nA review is underway into the errors that led to Luis Diaz’s goal being disallowed for offside, with VAR Darren England and assistant VAR Dan Cook, who failed to overturn the on-field decision after replays showed the Colombian was clearly onside, having been left off the list of officials for the next round of Premier League matches.\nReferees’ governing body PGMOL have agreed to Liverpool’s request to release the audio of the exchange between referee Simon Hooper and those in the VAR room at Stockley Park. The Merseyside club have received the audio and it is set to be made public in the future.\nIn a strongly-worded statement on Sunday, Liverpool argued that sporting integrity had been “undermined” and said they would “explore the range of options available, given the clear need for escalation and resolution”.\nBut what did Liverpool hope to achieve with that statement and what kind of resolution would satisfy them? The Athletic has contacted a number of senior figures at the club – who spoke on the condition of anonymity – to get a clearer idea of the answers to those questions.\nWatford players 'delighted' with new Ismael contract\nValerien Ismael's new contract with Watford has drawn a positive reaction from the players and he hopes they will now feed off it as they look to improve their form in the Championship.\nGoing into the latest round of fixtures Watford are 20th in the table, one point and two places above the relegation zone.\nBut Ismael is confident that the club are \"building something together\" and will improve.\n\"I think it was important to see as well the reaction of the player. They were pleased, they were delighted and a lot of positive reaction\n\"(It gives) that that energy because it's clear when you don't have the result and you know the (club's) past then everyone starts to have doubt and questioning everything again and this unnecessary bad energy. You don't need that energy at that time.\n\"And now it is turning another energy for us a positive energy because now we know this question now is completely aside and it's no excuse, no apologise for the players.\n\"I say we take our responsibility, but now the players need to take the responsibility on the pitch and the responsibility on the pitch is the performance.\n\"So some players need to raise the performance, they are able to do it better, they show already, they can do it better.\n\"But now that everyone need to step up and I think that it was a strong sign from the club, the club step up to say now this is our way.\n\"We build something together and everyone has to be aligned with that this decision.\"\nReal taking legal action over accusation they bribed referees\nReal Madrid are taking legal action after they were accused of bribing referees by a former police commissioner.\nJose Manuel Villarejo made the claims in a radio interview where he alleged that club president Florentino Perez engaged in illegal activity involving paying match officials.\nBarcelona and the former vice-president of Spanish football’s refereeing committee, Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira, were indicted for “corruption”, “breach of trust” and “false business records” in March, in a case brought by public prosecutors.\nThe club have always denied any wrongdoing and say Negreira was only ever hired as an “external consultant” although the case has since widened amid further charges.\nVillarejo claimed to RAC1 that Real engaged in similar practices but it was never pursued.\nVAR audio from Diaz disallowed goal to be released\nThe VAR audio from Luis Diaz’s disallowed goal for Liverpool in their game against Tottenham on Saturday is to be released.\nProfessional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), the body responsible for officiating in England, is reviewing the error that led to Diaz’s goal not standing and as part of that, Liverpool will receive the audio before it is made public.\nThe audio is set to be released before the next Match Officials Mic’d Up show, a monthly programme hosted by PGMOL chief and former Premier League referee Howard Webb which uses previously un-heard audio from match officials and VARs to explain decisions from the top flight.\nIsmael signs improved Watford contract\nValerien Ismael has agreed a new and improved contract at Watford.\nThe Athletic revealed last month that the Watford head coach was engaged in talks with the club regarding an extended deal, with enhanced terms and clauses.\nSporting director Cristiano Giaretta said upon the announcement: “The owner, the board and all of the senior management team have enjoyed getting to know and understanding Valerien and his methods.\n“It’s true we haven’t achieved the points we would like yet, but it’s the work and the progress we can see that gives us great confidence.”\nVAR officials not selected for upcoming matches after 'error'\nThe two match officials who were stood down from duty after Saturday’s incident in which Liverpool was incorrectly denied a goal against Tottenham Hotspur, will not participate in the upcoming Premier League fixtures this weekend.\nDarren England and Dan Cook served as VAR and assistant VAR during the incident in which a “significant human error” led to the incorrect disallowing of Luis Diaz’s goal in Liverpool’s 2-1 loss to Spurs.\nOn Tuesday, it was officially confirmed that England and Cook will not be among the officials listed for matchweek eight in the Premier League, taking place this upcoming Saturday and Sunday.\nAdrian Holmes, the assistant referee who flagged for offside for Diaz’s goal, has also not been included.\nRaphinha out of Brazil squad; replaced by David Neres\nBarcelona winger Raphinha has been replaced in the Brazil squad by Benfica’s David Neres.\nRaphinha sustained a hamstring injury during the first half of Barcelona’s 1-0 win over Sevilla on Friday night and although the Catalan side have not yet put a timeframe on his return, the 26-year-old will not join up with the Brazil squad in a week’s time.\nBrazil coach Fernando Diniz, who named his squad for the October internationals 10 days ago, has opted to call up Neres instead for the 2026 World Cup qualifiers against Venezuela and Uruguay.\nBarcelona face Porto and Granada before the international break, with the home game against Athletic Bilbao on October 22 as their first fixture back.\nFrimpong signs Leverkusen extension until 2028\nBayer Leverkusen full-back Jeremie Frimpong has extended his contract with the Bundesliga side until the summer of 2028.\nThe 22-year-old’s previous deal was due to expire in two years’ time, having been signed when he first moved from Celtic in January 2021.\n“Jeremie Frimpong has not just developed into an extremely popular figure in our squad over the past few years,” said Simon Rolfes, Leverkusen’s sporting director.\n“At the moment, he is one of the best players in the Bundesliga in his position as an attacking right-back.
