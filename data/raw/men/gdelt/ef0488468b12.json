McTominay and Frank Anguissa were vital players last season and are still available in midfield but Stanislav Lobotka and De Bruyne are both injured.\nFourFourTwo understands both will be back before the January transfer window but the double injury blow highlighted the need for quality depth in the middle of the pitch.\n“Napoli attempted [a Mainoo transfer] at the end of August, in the midst of the Hojlund deal,” writes Vincenzo D’Angelo. “And they'll try again.”\nNapoli’s title defence has been far from flawless in 2025-26 but they sit at the top of the Serie A table after nine matches. Second-placed Roma have a game in hand. Away defeats against AC Milan and Torino preceded last week’s 6-2 calamity against PSV in the Champions League but Napoli still have a 100% record at home in all competitions.\nIn FourFourTwo’s opinion, Mainoo could do a lot worse than Naples. If Man United intend to secure a transfer fee for the midfielder a decision on his future won’t be far away. It’s believed they don’t want to sell the 20-year-old but the next two months will tell him a lot about his prospects.\nThe Red Devils face Nottingham Forest on Saturday as Premier League action continues.\nGet Manchester United tickets at Seat Unique\nManchester United's hospitality offers comfortable, padded seating in the North West Quadrant.
