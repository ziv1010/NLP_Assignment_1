Ismael Saibari pulled one back.\nPortuguese champions Sporting beat Lille 2-0 at home, with impressive Swedish striker Viktor Gyoekeres on target before a Zeno Debast piledriver. The French side had Angel Gomes sent off.\nALSO READ:\n-\nWhy Sharjah Cricket Stadium is a big attraction for tourists from India, Pakistan\n-\nAl Ain coach Crespo rues missed chances in ACL opener\n-\nRonaldo's Al Nassr part ways with coach Castro\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
