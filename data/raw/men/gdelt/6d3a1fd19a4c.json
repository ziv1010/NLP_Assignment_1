  "body_text": "Why Liverpool are interested in buying Malaga\n- Liverpool evaluating whether to purchase Spanish club Malaga\n- Long-serving owners FSG keen to embark on multi-club project\n- Several other Premier League rivals also building empires\nArne Slot has tried his utmost to supply serenity to Liverpool after Jurgen Klopp's heavy-metal era, and the Dutchman is on course to return the Premier League title to Merseyside.\nSlot's impending achievement will be made all the more impressive given the outside noise which has prevailed over Anfield this term. The contract situations of three protagonists have dominated discourse despite their on-pitch brilliance, with outrage manifesting in the wake of recent Trent Alexander-Arnold developments.\nIn short, there's been plenty to talk about, and the club's owners, Fenway Sports Group (FSG), have laid the foundations for another notable point of discussion.\nIt looks like Liverpool are going to down the multi-club route. There's a desire within FSG to restore another fallen giant having worked wonders on the red side of the Mersey, and they're targeting a takeover of Spanish club Malaga.\nCurrent status of Liverpool's Malaga bid\nLiverpool are said to have held exploratory talks with a whole host of Spanish clubs in regards to a potential takeover, with FSG representatives speaking to Levante, Elche, Espanyol, Getafe and Real Valladolid.\nHowever, it seems as if the Reds have their sights set on second-tier side Malaga. The 2012/13 Champions League quarter-finalists have struggled financially in the aftermath of their modern-day apex in which Isco and Manuel Pellegrini were among the protagonists, slipping down to Spain'sthird tier before earning promotion last season.\nAt this stage, FSG are still evaluating a potential bid, having met with Malaga in February. They're weighing up whether to assume control of the 51% stake owned by majority shareholder Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani of Qatar. However, any takeover will be tricky due to the complex ownership situation at Malaga. They've been in adminstration since 2019.\nLiverpool will also have to fight off Paris Saint-Germain, who are seemingly much further along in their bid to acquire the Andalucian club. Some reports suggest a deal is close, with Qatar Sport Investment (QSI) keen to add to their empire.\nDo Liverpool own any other clubs?\nFSG currently owns Major League Baseball’s Boston Red Sox, National Hockey League franchise Pittsburgh Penguins, NASCAR’s RFK Racing, and TGL’s Boston Common Golf, but Liverpool are the only football club in their empire. Their intention to expand has been clear in recent years, especially after Michael Edwards returned to the Reds as CEO of football.\n\"One of the biggest factors in my decision is the commitment to acquire and oversee an additional club, growing this area of their organisation,\" Edwards said in an FSG statement after his appointment. \"I believe that to remain competitive, investment and expansion of the current football portfolio is necessary.\"\nThe Reds had previously resisted the urge to go down a path which many Premier League clubs have embarked on. The likes of Manchester City and Chelsea boast high-profile multi-club projects, with their respective empires stretching across the globe.\nWhile Liverpool have explored the idea of potentially purchasing a Brazilian club, they're keen on starting their process within Europe, rather than further afield.\nAre Liverpool allowed to own another club?\nMulti-club ownership has long come under scrutiny, and UEFA were forced to relax their rules last year to allow clubs under common ownership to compete in the same competition.\nThe concept is not a modern phenomenon, but there's been a boom over the past decade. Before 2012, 40 clubs were involved in a multi-club model, but this figure rose to almost 200 in 2024. There were trailblazers in the 20th century, such as Ken Bates and Daniel Levy, while the Pozzo family were perhaps the first owners to build their own footballing ecosystem. Mancheser City's City Football Group and Chelsea's BlueCo rank among the most significant multi-club models right now.\nWhile cynics and traditionalists see the very worst in multi-club ownership, it's very much legal.\nWhy Liverpool would want a multi-club project\nYou might not like it, but multi-club ownership provides an array of perks, and Liverpool want to get in on the fun.\nThere are commercial benefits, of course, such as brand expansion, but Edwards' intrigue doubtlessly focuses on the capacity to harbour the development of young and talented players.\nClubs which fall under the same empire are asked to play in a similar style, aiding development, with these feeder clubs, if you will, utilised to give youngsters minutes with the aim of eventually developing into a star at the flagship parent team.\nOverall, multi-club ownership supplies a greater sense of control and structure in regard to player development. There's scope for players to garner greater value while out on loan, which could facilitate impressive profits when sold on.\nBuilding such an empire also allows for a sharing of ideas and resources between clubs, with scouting networks widened.",
