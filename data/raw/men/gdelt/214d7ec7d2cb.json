Something that looks really good on paper that she can start playing with reserves now becomes really complicated in reality, because we’re not playing on natural grass pitches.\n\"So what we have done instead is that we have played internal games and we have referees coming here to London Colney to help us midweek and we have been doing that consistently during this block. That's been really important for the whole team, but also for Viv that she can be integrated into something that reminds her a bit more like a competitive game. But just behind closed doors.\"\nFinally, with Alessia Russo settled in the side and looking sharp in attack, our head coach was asked where Miedema's best starting position will be.\n\"I can see that working in different combinations and that's very exciting. We could see Alessia starting the game against Aston Villa as a 9, but we switched her to a 10 when Stina was coming in as a 9 and we worked on that partnership.\n\"What does that tells us? Miedema can play both as a 9 and as a 10. I think Alessia can do the same, she can also work as a 9 and a 10, so when we see them play together, when they do, what will bring their best qualities out of each other? We will have to see.\n\"That's the exciting thing in football, I have an idea in my head. But that doesn't count for much until it transpires out to the pitch. And I'm very excited to see them working together on the pitch, but we haven't had much time to do that so far.\"\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
