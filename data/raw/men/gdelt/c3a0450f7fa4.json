To make players talk openly about their feelings, lower stress levels, change their attitudes and routines about things like preparation and nutrition, and remove the stigma around mental training.\nWinning or losing no longer mattered. It was all about following a philosophy and culture established by Mannsverk, a former Royal Norwegian air force squadron leader whose military duties took him to Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks and to Libya for a NATO-led intervention in 2011.\nThe results have been extraordinary.\nAfter securing an immediate return to Norway’s top division, the team — based more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) north of Oslo in a fishing town, Bodø, with a population of around 55,000 — has captured four of the country’s last five league titles. It started in 2020 with a first in the history of a club founded in 1916.\nBodø/Glimt has also had some big results in Europe in recent seasons — a 6-1 thrashing of Jose Mourinho’s Roma in the Conference League 2021 stands out — and this year it has become the first Norwegian club to reach the semifinals of a major European competition.\nThe first leg against Tottenham in the Europa League takes place in London on Thursday. It’s Bodø/Glimt’s biggest ever match.\n“It is a fairy tale, almost a miracle,” Mannsverk told The Associated Press in a video interview. “How can you actually come from (Norway’s) second division in 2017 to playing a Champions League playoff and teams like Arsenal five years later?\n“But I think it’s possible ... if you have the right mentality and you work hard over time.”\nMeditation and Mannsverk’s mantra\nAn active air force pilot for more than 20 years, Mannsverk and others in his squadron were the subjects of a mental training project in 2010 where the focus was on meditation and “every day repeating boring stuff, but with 100% attention.”\nIt meant that when he was in Libya the following year, he had the mental capacity to handle the dangerous missions he was asked to perform. His squadron’s mantra — “train as you intend to fight” — worked.\n“Even though I got strong feelings when my first bombs hit the target and it was in infernal flames and fragments and everything,” he said, ”it was like, ‘My training said that it’s OK, this is happening, recognize that, but know I have to return and do my job.’”\nWith Bodø until recently having a NATO air base, it was simply a happy coincidence that Bodø/Glimt’s leadership came across members of the squadron at the same time as it was seeking a “silver bullet” — as Mannsverk put it — to improve the team’s mental conditioning.\nA project was born and fully embraced by manager Kjetil Knutsen following his appointment in 2018.\nBodø/Glimt has never looked back.\nThe “Bodø/Glimt Ring”\nMannsverk’s fingerprints are all over the team’s behavior, though he acknowledges there has been such a buy-in by the players that they now take decisions by themselves.\nLike having a rotating cast of eight captains to share leadership duties. Like when the players gather into a circle — Mannsverk calls it the “Bodø/Glimt Ring” — after conceding a goal to discuss what happened and maintain solidarity. Like the players having no specific targets, apart from being the best version of themselves.\nInge Henning Andersen, Bodø/Glimt’s chairman, told the AP that midfielder Ulrik Saltnes considered retiring because he used to suffer from stress-related stomach issues that flared up around matches. Saltnes opened up about his problems to Mannsverk and “finally found a way out of it,” Andersen said.\nThe team plays at an intensity that far exceeds its rivals, which players attribute to Mannsverk.\n“I don’t think it would be possible to play like that without Bjørn and the mental work we do,” Saltnes once told the BBC.\nTottenham manager Ange Postecoglou has come up against Bodø/Glimt twice before, losing on both occasions when in charge of Celtic in the Conference League in 2022, and he gave a nod to his opponent’s mental fortitude when asked about its strengths.\n“They have a real clear identity in the way they play,” the Australian coach said Wednesday. “I think they’ve created a real resilience in the group, a mental resilience that irrespective of who they play, whether that’s in the Norwegian league or the Champions League qualifiers or the Europa or Conference League, they treat every opponent the same.”\nBodø’s long and dark winters\nThis season’s Europa League campaign is giving Bodø/Glimt widespread attention, notably for its location.\nThe team’s Aspmyra stadium — with a capacity of less than 9,000 — is one of the most northernly in world soccer at 67 degrees latitude. Tourists have long come to the town on the tip of Norway’s west coast because it is a good spot to see the northern lights.\nBodø, named the European Capital of Culture in 2024, has less than an hour of sunlight during its shortest days, meaning players take supplements to combat a lack of sunlight. It can be bitterly cold and windy in the long winters, making for tough trips for opponents from other countries.\nOn paper, Tottenham, one of the world’s richest clubs, starts as a huge favorite against Bodø/Glimt. The likely crowd of nearly 63,000 at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for Thursday’s match will be bigger than Bodø’s population.\n“You’d love us to think that — that you’re a small club and we don’t rate (you),” a smiling Postecoglou replied to a leading question from a Norwegian reporter at the pre-match news conference.\nThe English club is having one of its worst seasons in a generation and currently lies 16th in the 20-team Premier League. It gives Bodø/Glimt a realistic shot at an upset, like it produced when getting past Italian team Lazio in the quarterfinals.\nIt’s another chance, then, for the club to write another amazing chapter in its remarkable journey.\n“We like to tell our story,” Mannsverk said. “The philosophy is a good thing. We know it’s difficult in football, where there’s so much money involved, to give a coach or a team the time. And it takes time to change and drill in the mentality.\n“This was not done overnight ... but I’m totally convinced that it will work more or less all over.”\nMore sports, gear and tickets\n- Where to watch NASCAR Truck Series at Daytona tonight: Free live stream\n- How to watch Syracuse lacrosse vs No. 1 Maryland today for free\n- Where to watch USA women’s hockey vs. Italy today: Winter Olympics free stream\n- Where to watch men’s singles figure skating final today: Winter Olympics free stream\n- Where to watch Syracuse women’s lacrosse vs. North Carolina for free today",
