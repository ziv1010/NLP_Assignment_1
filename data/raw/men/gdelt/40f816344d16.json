  "body_text": "Wycombe Wanderers manager Matt Bloomfield has revealed who he wants in the third round of the FA Cup.\nThe Chairboys progressed into the next stage of the world’s oldest football competition after they defeated Non League Wealdstone 2-0 at Grosvenor Vale, with Bez Lubala and Richard Kone scoring in each half.\nThe result was the Adams Park’s side first in the second round of the FA Cup since the 2017/18 season, and it is the first time they will enter the third round stage since 2020/21.\nThat year, Wycombe were in the Championship and therefore had an automatic space in that stage of the cup.\nSpeaking after the victory on November 30, Bloomfield, who has now helped Wanderers win their last 11 consecutive games in all competitions, said: “For me, it has to be Manchester United.\n“I never played against or competed against them in my career, and the class of 92 played a huge part as I grew up.\n“But there are so many incredible football clubs in the third round, and all we are focusing on is trying to progress as far as we possibly can.”\nThe draw will be made in the evening of Monday, December 2.\nThe victory over Wealdstone means the Chairboys have now won 11 games in a row, making it their longest winning streak since their Non League days over 30 years ago.\nWycombe have scored in 23 of their 24 games since August, and have netted on two or more occasions in 19 fixtures.\nThe brilliant start to the season has seen Wanderers go top of the League One table, whilst also progressing into the third round of the League Cup where they narrowly lost to Champions League participants Aston Villa 2-1, and into the knockout rounds of the EFL Trophy.\nBloomfield added: “Winning 11 games in a row is beyond our expectations and I don’t mind saying that.\n“We had a good second half of last season where we got 40 points from 23 games which was the fourth highest in the league, so we believed in what we are trying to do.\n“Our aim at the start of the season was to build on our 10th placed finish [from last season] and that remains the aim.\n“We are trying in the league to get as many points as possible.\n“I was so pleased with the application of the group.”\nFinally, on making 11 changes in the cup tie, as well as the fans’ support at Wealdstone, Bloomfield concluded: “We knew there would be changes to the team, plus being on TV and with it being the very early kick-off, I told the boys what I wanted as all these things could play a part [in causing an upset].\n“The one thing I wanted to take away was to play the way I expected us to play, which we did.\n“ Also, the fans were incredible.\n“We have a very rich Non League heritage and we must remember that time.\n“I know a large chunk of our supporters are proud of that and were looking forward to the tie as they would be closer to the players and the pitch.\n“I’m thankful for the support they have given us this season.”",
