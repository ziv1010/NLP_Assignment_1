At Borussia Dortmund, Bellingham wasn't granted such luxury.\nThe England international was instead used in a more disciplined box-to-box role where he was expected to contribute in all phases and serve as Dortmund's key midfield driving force. Bellingham certainly did that while also improving his goal tally from the previous season. He scored just three Bundesliga goals in 2021/22, but eight in 2022/23.\nBellingham was one of several key contributors as Dortmund looked poised to finally break Bayern Munich's prolonged monopoly over the Bundesliga. Bellingham inspired BVB to convincing wins over Wolfsburg and Borussia Monchengladbach in May, but a knee injury meant he missed the final two games of the season. With the midfielder only fit enough for the bench on the last day, BVB surrendered their advantage at the summit by drawing 2-2 with Mainz.\nAs a result, Bellingham's final season in Dortmund ended trophyless. While the Englishman starred during the Champions League group stages, scoring four goals in Dortmund's first four games, including one against Manchester City, the German side were knocked out in the round of 16 by Chelsea.\nDortmund were also knocked out of the DFB-Pokal in the quarter-finals by RB Leipzig.\nJude Bellingham 2022/23 England record\nBellingham's England numbers don't exactly jump out, but his impact on Gareth Southgate's midfield has nonetheless been profound.\nThe former Birmingham starlet played a peripheral role during the Three Lions' memorable Euro 2020 campaign, but the midfielder emerged as a leading man at the 2022 World Cup. Bellingham started all five of England's games in Qatar as he became just the second teenager to score for his country at the World Cup.\nThe midfielder scored in England's rout of Iran before wonderfully assisting Jordan Henderson against Senegal in the round of 16 following a trademark burst from midfield. Bellingham was then superb as he duelled future teammate Aurelien Tchouameni in the quarter-finals, but England were brutally knocked out by France after a late Harry Kane penalty miss.\nIt was a coming-of-age tournament for Bellingham, whose supreme talent was immediately recognisable on football's biggest stage.",
