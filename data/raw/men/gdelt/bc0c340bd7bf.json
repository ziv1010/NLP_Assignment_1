The Atlas Lions have lost just once since Qatar – a 2-1 June 2023 reverse to South Africa in qualifying for this tournament – and have a heady mix of superb individual talent and clever tactics from manager Walid Regragui in the dugout. Achraf Hakimi is one of the world's best right-backs, with Noussair Mazraoui of Bayern Munich just as effective on the opposite flanks. Nayf Aguerd is a calming central presence while Hakim Ziyech and Youssef En-Nesyri lead a deadly forward line.\nTanzania may sit 121st in the current FIFA rankings, but there's no doubt the Taifa Stars will be inspired by the other upsets in AFCON 2023. One-time Aston Villa flop Ally Samatta, now of PAOK in Greece, is the most famous name in the squad that also includes Portsmouth defender Hai Mnoga, who has enjoyed excellent National League loan spells with Aldershot and Weymouth.
