More importantly, they also are looking to seal a top-four finish and return to the Champions League.\nAs a result, plans to further strengthen their squad are well underway with Ten Hag reportedly chasing three big-name signings. By widespread accounts, United want to bring in a right-back, a centre-half and a striker this summer.\nHowever, The Times claims United are actually planning for TWO striker signings – an elite frontman and a talented prospect.\nAnd the paper claims their No 1 target is Tottenham and England striker Harry Kane. While any deal will likely prove tricky, there appears a growing feeling at Spurs that talismanic star Kane could be on his way.\nWith just a year left on his deal, his situation is being watched with great intensity by United.\nKane is seen as a replacement for temporary signing Wout Weghorst.\nWhile it remains a question of whether United can agree a deal, they are making bigger strides with a first arrival.\nAnd according to The Times, they are hot on the trail for Atalanta frontman Rasmus Hojlund.\nHe has leap to stardom this season by scoring five goals in two games for Denmark. At 20, he appears the perfect addition for the Red Devils too, having scored eight times in 31 games for the Serie A side.\nHojlund in, Martial out for Man Utd\nHe stands at 6ft 3in and was initially valued at £60m amid interest from United and Arsenal.\nHowever, Italian paper Corriere della Sera now indicates that Manchester United will be able to sign him for nearer £40m.\nThat will still allow Atalanta to more almost treble their £14.7m (€17m) signing from Sturm Graz just a year ago.\nSeen by many as having comparisons with Erling Haaland, the 20-year-old striker could become the next Scandinavian attacker to move to the Premier League.\nGiven his new price, United are said to be extremely keen on his signing and are ready to meet their asking price.\nAnd reports claim his arrival will allow United to wave farewell to Antony Martial after eight seasons at the club.\nWith just a year left on his deal, Ten Hag is looking to move the Frenchman on after he fell out of favour. With only nine Premier League starts this season, his injury record continues to frustrate the club.\nNow Ten Hag is looking to move him on and bring in a more reliable option in the form of Hojlund.\nAnd a deal for two strikers will leave Martial with no chance of game-time at United. Quite how much they can ask for him remains to be seen, but at 27 the time is definitely right for the striker to seek a new challenge.\nREAD MORE: The five strikers heavily linked with Man Utd and how they compare in 2022/23: Kane, Osimhen…\nCHELSEA OFFER INTER FOUR PLAYERS IN ANDRE ONANA SWAP\nIncoming new Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino has approved the signing of goalkeeper Andre Onana this summer, per reports.\nThe Argentine is set to take charge at Stamford Bridge at the end of the season – and has a massive job on his hands.\nAnd despite spending well over £500m since taking charge, the Chelsea squad still has a number of holes in it.\nIndeed, Pochettino has reportedly demanded four big-name signings this summer to redress that balance.\nOf course, a number of players will have to leave the club too, with even some of Todd Boehly’s big-name signings seemingly on their way.\nAdhering to the old ‘build from the back’ adage, Pochettino has given Chelsea the green light to pursue a deal for Andre Onana.\nThe Cameroon keeper is regarded as one of the best in the world and has helped Inter reach the Champions League final.\nAnd while finances mean Inter are open to a big-money sale, Chelsea are still looking to bring down their outlay.\nNow according to the Daily Express, they can do that by offering Inter their pick from four stars in exchange.\nUp for grabs, and most likely to move, is Croatian midfielder Mateo Kovacic, who has been cleared to leave.\nA move to the San Siro would see him rejoin the club he initially left to join Real Madrid way back in 2015.\nHowever, he is not the only player up for discussion at the Nerazzurri.\nAnd Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Trevoh Chalabah and Edouard Mendy could also reportedly be used as makeweights.\nDiscussions over any deal, however, are likely to be on hold until after the Champions League final on June 10.\nINTER SET ARSENAL, CHELSEA, MAN UTD TAG FOR LAUTARO MARTINEZ\nIt could prove something of a firesale at Inter Milan this summer with a number of their other sides also seemingly up for grabs.\nAnd per widespread reports, the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea and Man Utd are all plotting moves for Argentine striker Lautaro Martinez.\nThe striker is enjoying an excellent season, having scored 25 goals in 52 appearances.\nHowever, speculation is mounting that a move to the Premier League could be on the cards with Arsenal seemingly leading the chase.\nNow according to Football Insider, Inter chiefs are open to his sale if their price tag of £69.5m (€80m) is met.\nAnd they claim that as well as Arsenal, the valuation has also alerted Manchester United and Chelsea.\nUnited are in the hunt for a new big-name striker and Martinez could well fit the bill.\nChelsea, meanwhile, are also struggling to settle on a regular frontman and could look to trigger a move.\nEither way, his asking price is likely to attract plenty of attention, though – like Onana – no move will take place until after the UCL final.",
