Swansea target Adam Idah was missing from the squad.\nThere was just short of 2,500 Celtic fans inside Ibrox and it was noisy, colourful and nervy.\nIn the seventh minute there was a Rangers penalty claim when Miovski and Celtic defender Liam Scales clashed inside the Hoops box but referee Don Robertson was having none of it.\nChants for Raskin rang round the blue-covered sections of the stadium before the half-hour mark as a poor first half unfolded.\nAnd the cheers that followed Souttar heading in a free-kick from skipper James Tavernier soon ended when VAR confirmed an offside.\nThere was little improvement at the start of the second half, with Rangers still playing more direct football than previously this season.\nIn the 53rd minute Gers winger Djeidi Gassama left Parkhead defender Kieran Tierney trailing the right flank but his cross was snuffed out, ending in the hands of Celtic goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.\nGers keeper Jack Butland made his first real save on the hour mark and it was a comfortable one from Reo Hatate's long-distance drive before he kept out an overhead kick from Tierney.\nIn the 65th minute James Forrest and Shin Yamada replaced Arne Engels and Balikwisha, with Tierney off for Sarrachi.\nCyriel Dessers and Oliver Antman came on for Miovski and Moore, then Nedim Bajrami took over from Thelo Aasgaard, as Martin looked to re-energise his flagging side.\nBut the match ended goalless, with neither side deserving the win.",
