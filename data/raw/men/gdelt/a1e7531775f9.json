  "body_text": "The 25 Best Midfielders in Soccer History—Ranked\nIn soccer, midfielders come in all shapes and sizes.\nSome excel in passing, able to drive the ball the length of the field or slide in killer through-balls into spaces unseen by the opposition.\nOthers are instead better at tackling, stopping their opposing number dead in their tracks to help keep in-tact that all important clean sheet.\nSome even work in the shadows, appearing from the outside to be doing very little, but to the trained eye, masterfully dictating the tempo of a match like a human metronome.\nHere, Sports Illustrated ranks the best to ever do it, regardless of their chosen niche.\n25. Frank Lampard\nMidfielders aren’t generally expected to score a lot of goals, but it’s always a bonus when they do.\nFrank Lampard was a master of that art.\nIn just over 1,000 games for club and country, the Englishman scored a mightily impressive 301 goals, most of which were for Chelsea, with whom he spent the majority of his domestic career.\nHe retired in 2017 as the Blues’ record goalscorer and the Premier League’s most prolific midfielder of all time.\n24. Steven Gerrard\nSteven Gerrard and Frank Lampard were often pitted against each other during their time together in the Premier League.\nHowever, while Lampard was the more talented attacker of the two, Gerrard was the better all-rounder and possessed leadership qualities that his English compatriot lacked.\nLampard was always surrounded by world class players during his time at Chelsea, but at Liverpool, Gerrard would often find himself lining up alongside the likes of El Hadji Diouf and Djimi Traoré.\nNevertheless, he’d still drag Liverpool through the mud with his explosive, box-to-box displays, seemingly doing the job of an entire team on his own at times.\n23. Patrick Vieira\nFew sights struck as much fear into the hearts of Premier League midfielders in the noughties as the figure of a 6'4\" Patrick Vieira standing across from them.\nA towering presence in the middle of the park both physically and metaphorically, there was little anyone could do to stop the Arsenal midfielder once he was on one of his trademark gazelle-like runs.\nThe World Cup-winning Frenchman was also nigh impossible to dribble past and loved a tackle, even if some of them veered on the nasty side.\nAs close to being a “complete” midfielder as they come, Vieira won three Premier League titles with the Gunners before moving to Italy in 2006, where he would go on to collect four Serie A crowns with Inter Milan.\n22. Clarence Seedorf\nClarence Seedorf remains the only player in soccer history to have won the Champions League with three different clubs, having claimed European soccer’s most prestigious club prize with all of Ajax, Real Madrid and AC Milan.\nThose achievements alone, however, don’t do the Dutch midfielder justice.\nOne of the greatest box-to-box midfielders of all time, Seedorf could do it all, from pinging long-range passes, to making last-ditch tackles, to firing the ball into the net with his tree-trunk thighs.\n21. Kevin De Bruyne\nThough his career is now coming to its tail end, Kevin De Bruyne has been one of world soccer’s best midfielders now for almost a decade.\nSince moving to Manchester City in 2015, the Belgian playmaker has, with the help of his trademark whipped ball into the box and his rocket right foot, steered the Sky Blues to every major honour in world soccer, including six Premier League titles, two FA Cups and a Champions League.\nA creative marvel, he’s also the English top flight’s second highest-ever assister with 119. When fit and available, Napoli have reaped the rewards of this creative gem.\n20. Andrea Pirlo\nFew players in history have ever looked so relaxed playing soccer as Andrea Pirlo.\nSeemingly unable to feel pressure and never rushed, the deep-lying Italian playmaker always appeared to have time on his hands, which, more often than not, he used to pick out a teammate with one of his trademark looping passes that he'd drop on a dime.\nOne of just select few to ever have played for all of Milan, Inter and Juventus, Pirlo won almost everything there is to win for both club and country, including six Serie A titles, two Champions Leagues and the World Cup.\n19. Toni Kroos\nToni Kroos shocked the soccer world at the end of the 2023–24 season when he announced his surprise retirement from the sport at the age of 34.\nWhile 34 is generally not considered that early for a player to call it quits, it was for Kroos, because at the time he was still one of the world’s top midfielders and was showing no signs of slowing down.\nThe Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Germany legend—who was nicknamed Garçom (“waiter” in Portuguese) because of his ability to serve up chances on plates for attackers—won it all, including a joint-record six Champions Leagues and the World Cup.\n18. Michael Laudrup\nFew players in history have dared cross the Clásico divide to play for both Barcelona and Real Madrid.\nMichael Laudrup was one of them.\nEven rarer is that, because of his superb performances for the two Spanish giants, he remains adored by both sets of fans.\nA master creator who exuded class, “The Prince of Denmark” first won four La Liga titles and a European Cup with Barça, before he left for Madrid following a falling out with manager Johan Cruyff. In his first season in the Spanish capital, he then inspired a previously struggling Madrid to domestic glory.\n17. Sergio Busquets\nAlbert Einstein once said that the “definition of genius is taking the complex and making it simple.”\nWith soccer, Sergio Busquets does just that.\nUnlike the atypical defensive midfielder, the Spaniard doesn’t cover miles of ground, make hard-hitting tackles, or seemingly run anywhere at pace, but instead moves only himself, and the ball, when he needs to. Each touch is calculated and each pass is released just at the right time and with the perfect weight.\nBusquets’s brilliance has often gone unnoticed, but he was integral to the all-conquering Spain and Barcelona teams of the 2010s.\n16. Gheorghe Hagi\nGheorghe Hagi’s first coach, Iosif Bükössy, got the early scoop on what the rest of Europe would soon come to admire. “He could do everything with the ball,” FC Constanța’s youth team boss recalled. “To watch him was like watching a fairytale.”\nHagi certainly fit the mythical bill with a wand of a left foot, equally capable of finesse and fury.\nEmbedded into the hearts and minds of a generation with impressive tournaments at all three World Cups staged in the 1990s, Hagi would move to Real Madrid and then Barcelona after the global jamborees in 1990 and 1994 respectively. Yet it was at Galatasaray, during the glittering twilight of his career, where Hagi arguably played his best, crowning his Türkiye tenure with a UEFA Cup final triumph over Arsenal in 2000.\n15. Luka Modric\nLuka Modrić broke the Lionel Messi-Cristiano Ronaldo Ballon d’Or duopoly in 2018 following a stellar year for club and country, which saw him win a third consecutive Champions League title with Real Madrid and reach an unlikely World Cup final with Croatia.\nThe midfielder, known for his luxurious footwork and devastating passing, was instrumental for his teams in achieving those respective achievements, but really, the award was the culmination of what had been a decade of domestic and international excellence.\nNow in his twilight years, no player in history has ever won more trophies with Madrid than Modrić, who scooped 28 in 13 years before moving to Milan in 2025. Even 40, the magesterial midfielder is still outrunning Father Time.\n14. Frank Rijkaard\nFresh off the back of winning a glut of titles in his home country with Ajax, Frank Rijkaard was brought to Milan in 1988 as part of coach Arrigo Sacchi’s “Total Football” revolution.\nThe move proved to be an astute one for both player and club, with Rijkaard going on to help Milan win two Serie A titles, two European Cups and a Coppa Italia across the next five seasons.\nA tenacious and yet composed holding midfielder with just the right amount of flair, the Dutchman won Serie A’s Player of the Year award in 1992 and finished third at Ballon d’Or on two separate occasions, though in all honesty, he deserved much more individual recognition.\n“Dunga, [Marcel] Desailly, [Roy] Keane and [Patrick] Vieira all performed that role brilliantly, but Frank is the best holding player ever,” Rijkaard’s Netherlands teammate Ronald Koeman previously said of him.\n13. Kaka\nKaka’s prime was relatively short, but as his best, he was truly frightening.\nTall, strong, quick and skilful, the Brazilian had real power and grace in possession, particularly when on the run, meaning he was able to glide through opposition defences like a knife through butter.\nHis performances for AC Milan in 2006–07, most notably in the Champions League, where he finished top scorer as the Rossoneri won the trophy, saw him win the Ballon d’Or.\n12. Johan Neeskens\nJohan Cruyff was the master technician that fired Ajax, Barcelona and their “Total Football” to glory in the 1970s.\nJohan Neeskens, meanwhile, was the ying to his yang.\nA tireless runner who excelled in regaining possession and passing, the Dutch midfielder provided the balance and energy needed for their system to thrive. He was also good for a goal or two.\nIn seven years alongside Cruyff at the two clubs, Neeskens won three European Cups, two Eredivisie titles and a Copa del Rey.\nThe pair were also part of the Netherlands squad that finished as runners-up at the 1974 World Cup, a tournament in which Neeskens scored five goals.\n11. Xavi Hernandez\nOne third of what many consider to be soccer’s greatest-ever midfield trio alongside Sergio Busquets and Andrés Iniesta, Xavi Hernández was a scheming puppet master.\nThanks to his decisive passing and smart movement, he could switch the tempo of any game at will, speeding it up to create scoring opportunities when opposition teams least expected it, and slowing it down to regain the momentum when losing control.\nPulling his invisible strings, Xavi guided Barcelona and Spain to unprecedented glory, conquering Europe and the world with both.\n“If football was a science, Xavi would have discovered the formula,” former Real Madrid coach Jorge Valdano once said of the Spaniard, who hung up his boots in 2019. “With a ball at his feet, no one else has ever communicated so intelligently with every player on the pitch.”\n10. Luis Suárez\nNo, not the Luis Suárez who is currently tearing up Major League Soccer alongside Lionel Messi at Inter Miami, but the Spanish midfielder who won the Ballon d’Or in 1960.\nLike his namesake, Suárez also played for Barcelona, where he won two La Liga titles in 1959 and 1960 before moving to Inter. In Italy, he won a further three league titles, as well as two European Cups.\nThe Spaniard, who was nicknamed “The Architect” by Alfredo Di Stéfano because of his playmaking skills, was also a part of the Spain squad that claimed the European Championships in 1964.\n9. Andres Iniesta\nLionel Messi gets most of the plaudits for making Barcelona the best and most dominant soccer team on the planet in the 2000s and 2010s. Right behind the Argentine in terms of impact on the pitch, however, was Andrés Iniesta.\nThe diminutive Spaniard was the driving force in Barça’s midfield, able to turn defence into attack in the blink of an eye thanks to his genius playmaking instincts and unrivalled ball-carrying ability.\nHe also came in clutch on the big occasion for Barça on multiple occasions, as well as for Spain, most notably scoring his country’s only goal in 1–0 win over the Netherlands in the final of 2010 World Cup.\n8. Socrates\nThe aptly named Sócrates was not just a soccer superstar, but also a philosopher of the game.\nThe embodiment of Brazil's famed joga bonito, or “play beautiful” mantra, the Brasileirão legend captivated fans with his elegant and collected style of play, as well his powerful and accurate right foot.\n“I see football as art,” the former midfielder, who was also a medical doctor, once said. “Today most people see football as a competition, a confrontation, a war between two polar opposites, but to start with, it is a great form of art.”\n7. Lothar Matthaus\nLothar Matthäus being nicknamed after a German World War II tank (“Der Panzer”) should tell you all you need to know about his all-action style of play.\nA combative but technically gifted midfielder, the Bundesliga legend was a truly dominant force in the centre of the park who could switch between being a defensive enforcer and attacking threat at any moment.\nThose wide range of skills were best on display during Germany’s 4–1 win over Yugoslavia in their opening game of the 1990 World Cup, when Matthäus scored twice from holding midfield to lay the foundations of what would go on to be a winning campaign.\nAlso a European champion and Ballon d’Or winner, Diego Maradona once described Matthäus as the toughest opponent he ever faced, which is some compliment.\n6. Ruud Gullit\nBefore he became the Ultimate Team card that every EA FC player one day dreams of packing, Ruud Gullit was one of the world’s most revered soccer players.\nA jack of all trades, the dreadlocked dynamo could play anywhere from sweeper to centre forward, but it was in midfield where he was a master.\nGullit was powerful, elegant, almost impossible to dispossess and, as demonstrated by his 235 career goals, had habit of finding the net, especially in big games.\nThe star player in a Milan team that dominated Italian and European soccer in the late 1980s and early ’90s, Gullit won the Ballon d’Or in 1987.\n5. Bobby Charlton\nThe greatest players win the acclaim of their adversaries but even fewer have been able to garner the good graces of the game’s referees. Sir Bobby Charlton was crowned European Player of the Year and came out on top in a poll of English referees in search of the “Model Player” in 1966. He also pulled off the little feat of winning the World Cup that summer.\nBoasting a thunderous shot off both feet, Charlton seemed to glide six inches above the mud-soaked pitches of his day, unbothered by the bog beneath him as he went about dominating for England and Manchester United. By the end of his legendary career, he would be the top scorer in the history of both establishments.\n4. Zico\nBy some measures, Zico is highest-scoring midfielder of all time, having the found the net a mammoth 507 times during a career spent mostly with his boyhood club, Flamengo.\nA light-footed playmaker with a bag of tricks bigger than Santa’s sack, the Brazilian, who was sometimes referred to has the “White Pelé,” also perfected the art of the direct free kick.\nHe scored 101 of them, which is more than any other player in soccer history by a considerable margin.\n3. Roberto Baggio\nThroughout his career, Roberto Baggio played as a striker, second striker, centre forward and winger. It was as an attacking midfielder, however, that he most thrived.\nBlessed with incredible dribbling skills, insane soccer intelligence, and one of the best first touches the game has ever seen, the “Divine Ponytail” both scored and created goals for fun, finding the net 227 times and teeing up his teammates 152 times during a career spent entirely in his home country.\nDescribed by Pep Guardiola, a man who starred alongside the likes of Luís Figo, Romário and Rivaldo, as the best player he’s ever played with, Baggio won the Ballon d’Or in 1993.\nHis achievements are made even more impressive by the fact that he spent most of his career playing with a dodgy knee.\n2. Michel Platini\nKids these days will perhaps recognise Michel Platini as the former disgraced president of UEFA who was banned from the sport for eight years for ethics breaches.\nFor older fans, however, the Frenchman is celebrated as one of the greatest players of his era.\nA cerebral midfield playmaker, Platini excelled in the space behind the strikers, where he created chances with precision and scored prolifically himself, netting 354 goals over the course of his career.\nHis crowning moment as a player (aside perhaps from his three Ballon d’Or wins) was at the 1984 European Championships, where he scored nine goals to fire France to glory.\n1. Zinedine Zidane\nNobody has ever, or likely will ever, do it like Zinedine Zidane.\nThe Frenchman was dynamic yet languid, powerful yet graceful. He played with a trademark Gallic nonchalance, but was somehow always one step ahead of the opposition.\nAs former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes once put it, to see Zidane was “poetry in motion.”\nA World Cup, European Championship, Champions League, and Ballon d’Or winner, “Zizou” is simply the greatest of all-time.\nREAD MORE ON THE GREATEST IN SOCCER\nBarnaby Lane is a highly experienced sports writer who has written for The Times, FourFourTwo Magazine, TalkSPORT, and Business Insider.
