  "body_text": "Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, has posted a video showing rare pictures of his early school days.\nThe video, on his Instagram account, also features a series of childhood photographs with his father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, Vice President and Ruler of Dubai.\nThe video includes a message for pupils in the UAE.\n“I still remember my very first day of school. I was just a child but my dreams were already big. For knowledge is light and with it, nations rise. With every new school year a fresh dream is born. Together, we shape the future of our homeland and always remember, with knowledge we rise and with values, we build,” Sheikh Hamdan said.\nSheikh Hamdan attended Rashid School for Boys in Dubai and then Dubai School of Government. After his schooling, he followed in his father's footsteps to undergo officer training in the UK, graduating from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in 2001.\nThe experience, Sheikh Hamdan said in a 2012 interview with a Dubai magazine, “showed me the importance of self-discipline, commitment, virtue, responsibility, endurance, understanding, teamwork, and friendship… and the benefits of hard work\".\nAfter Sandhurst, he continued his education at London School of Economics.\n“Continuing my studies overseas was important,” he said in the same interview. “It provided me with new skills and taught me how to apply them.”\nSheikh Hamdan has a large following on social media, including 17 million on Instagram, where he often posts pictures offering insights into his childhood and family life. He has 4.8 million followers on X.\nAs more than one million pupils in the UAE returned to classrooms on Monday, leaders wished them success. President Sheikh Mohamed shared an audio message that was broadcast simultaneously in public and private schools.\n“To all students, teachers, administrators and parents, I extend my congratulations on the start of the new academic year, and I wish everyone a successful year ahead,” Sheikh Mohamed said.\n“Education is the foundation of our nation’s forward-looking vision and each of you contributes to achieving this future. To all students, I encourage you to pursue education with drive and passion, as it is the bridge upon which you will build your future and serve your nation.”\nA day before schools reopened for the new academic year, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid also posted a message on X. He said new beginnings “carry optimism, goodness and hope”, while noting that the start of the new academic year “brings energy and momentum”.\n“We say to our children, every school day is an opportunity to learn something new, and achieve a different accomplishment, and elevate your minds and aspirations, and get closer to your goals,” he wrote.\n“And we say to the teachers, you are the pillar of our renaissance, and the makers of change in our schools. We do not want education that merely fills students with knowledge but education that ignites in them the curiosity for knowledge, and kindles the flame of ambition, and fuels the fire of passion.”\nHe added that he wants all pupils, teachers and those working in education to have a “more beautiful, greater and better academic year”.",
