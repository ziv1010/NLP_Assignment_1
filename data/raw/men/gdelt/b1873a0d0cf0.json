They played out a goalless draw against Hellas Verona in their last game and will perhaps feel they deserved more from the game but failed to convert their chances.\nSpezia sit 17th in the league table with 21 points from 25 games. They will be looking to shake off their latest results and return to winning ways when they play this weekend.\nInter have had a largely solid campaign but are well behind in the title race and are now pushing for Champions League football. They picked up a 2-0 win over Lecce in their last game.\nThe visitors sit second in the league table with 50 points from 25 games this season. They are 15 points behind Napoli at the top of the pile and will aim to reduce that gap on Friday.\nInter have won three of their last four matches and have lost just one of their last eight outings. The sheer gulf in class and quality between the two teams should see the visitors come out on top.\nCredit: sportskeeda.com\nAtalanta hope to get back on track against runaway leaders Napoli\nNapoli’s defeat at home to Lazio last Friday should not affect their chances of claiming a third Scudetto this season. As much as it was a surprise for the Partenopei to lose – and concede a goal for the first time since January – the league title is almost guaranteed to be making its way to Naples this year.\nNapoli should not be complacent though, and may well be even more keen to claim the three points this weekend against Atalanta.\nA home win should be the outcome on Saturday and it would not be a surprise if Victor Osimhen finds the net at some point during the proceedings.\nAtalanta will be keen to put up a fight though. Gian Piero Gasperini is frustrated that his side has only picked up one point in the last three games, and will want some victories soon to meet the club’s Champions League aspirations.\nA goalless draw at home to struggling Udinese last weekend followed disappointing defeats at the hands of Milan and Lecce. SoAtalanta need to create something to spark their season back into life. There is no European football this season, of course, and they are already out of the Coppa Italia.\nUltimately, hoping to get back on track against the runaway Serie A leaders is probably too much. But a good performance from Atalanta will give them some renewed confidence ahead of games against Empoli, Cremonese and Bologna.\nCredit: football-italia.net\nCadiz, Getafe battle to stay out of relegation zone\nTwo teams battling to stay out of the La Liga relegation zone will lock horns on Friday evening, with Cadiz welcoming Getafe to Estadio Nuevo Mirandilla.\nCadiz are currently 15th in the La Liga table, one point and one position above Getafe, who are level on points with 18th-placed Almeria in the battle to avoid the drop.\nCadiz have picked up seven points from their last four matches in Spain’s top flight. Cadiz have won four, drawn five and lost three of their 12 league games in front of their own fans this season to collect 17 points, and their form at home is likely to be key when it comes to their chances of staying in La Liga.\nThe last two La Liga matches between these two sides have finished level, including a goalless draw in the reverse fixture back in November.\nGetafe’s recent form has also been impressive, losing just one of their last five league fixtures.\nThe last two league matches between these two sides have finished level, and we can see another stalemate on Friday night. There is not a huge difference in the quality between the teams, and a draw appears to be the most likely result considering the recent form of both sides.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk\nA resurgent Liverpool take on Bournemouth with eyes on top-4\nA resurgent Liverpool travel to Bournemouth on Saturday with eyes on the Premier League’s top four.\nJurgen Klopp’s side thrashed rivals Manchester United 7-0 on Sunday to go three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham and could ramp up the pressure even more with another win on the south coast.\nThree points would take the Reds level on points with Spurs before Antonio Conte’s side even kick a ball this weekend. After so much soul-searching for Liverpool this season, that would be some statement.\nBournemouth, meanwhile, were desperately unlucky not to take something from Arsenal on Saturday\nWhile Klopp’s side can hardly expect another 9-0 rout, it’s difficult to look past them winning after making such light work of United.\nWith the new-look front three beginning to gel and a first-choice backline proving consistently resilient in the Premier League, Liverpool should face little resistance en route to a routine three points.\nBournemouth’s attacking endeavours against Man City and Arsenal must be applauded, but even the odd consolation goal should be a step too far for the Cherries as Liverpool continue their top-four charge.\nCredit: standard.co.uk",
