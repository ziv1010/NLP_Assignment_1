Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘I insist, people are talking about a lot with Barcelona and Arsenal,’ ESPN journalist Jorge Baravalle said.\n‘But I’m being told that the team slowly moving forward is Chelsea. Chelsea, quietly, are advancing for Julián Álvarez.”\n‘I’m told there are conversations. In fact, part of the agency handling Julián’s transfer was in London this week, watching Chelsea v Arsenal.\n‘They know both clubs want him, but what I’m being told is that, as of today, the most advanced contacts are with Chelsea.’\nAnalysis: Could Alvarez signing be a risk\nAlvarez has just one La Liga goal in his last 15 matches – that one coming from the penalty spot against Sevilla at the start of November. For his last goal from open play, you have to go back to 27 September.\nEurope has offered some respite but the headline is still grim reading – in all competitions, Alvarez hasn’t score since the Champions League victory over PSV Eindhoven on 9 December.\nHis form has sparked somewhat eyebrow-raising comments from Atletico president Enrique Cerezo last week, telling reporters: ‘He’s going through a moment where we don’t know what’s happening to him.’\nDiego Simeone is stood firmly behind his striker, hitting back at critics daring to question his ability to find the back of the net. When asked why he or Atletico supporters should believe in Alvarez, Simeone replied: ‘Seriously? Are you seriously asking me that?\n‘The truth is that Julian Alvarez speaks for himself, because of the name he has, the authority he carries, and the career he’s built, right?’\nAll things considered, Simeone is right. Alvarez is a proven goal scorer, at the very highest level in football having scored four times to help his nation lift the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.\nBut as some recent big-money signings have shown, sometimes there are just no guarantees.\nRead the full analysis from Metro’s Tony Mogan by clicking here.\nChelsea spent big on Joao Pedro and Liam Delap last summer, and reportssuggest they may need to part ways with 100m euros (£87m) to add Alvarez to their attacking ranks.\nMore Trending\nSpeaking in December last year about the speculation surrounding his future at Atletico, Alvarez said: ‘Look, it doesn’t bother me. I try not to pay much attention, but I know what’s being said.\n‘It’s all over social media. I think it’s more what’s being said online than what’s actually happening.\n‘I’m very focused on this season, on what lies ahead with Atletico Madrid. So, I try to tune it out and think about myself, about continuing to grow as a player, and about winning.’\nPrefer us to the others?
