I'm not afraid to play.\"\nThe numbers certainly back up what Yoro said. The young defender completed the second-most passes in Ligue 1 last season with a rather impressive 94% completion rate. Top stuff.\nRio Ferdinand's role in the transfer\nThere were a few key reasons why Yoro ended up at Man Utd instead of Real Madrid and the defender has confessed Rio Ferdinand's influence was certainly one of those.\n\"It was like two weeks ago [when I first spoke to Rio],\" he explained. \"He called me. First of all, I was really impressed to speak with him and, yeah, we spoke like 10 minutes about Man Utd, so he helped me a lot to make my choice. It was really an honour to speak with him.\n\"He spoke to me about the club, and that this is a historic club with a big story, and if I go there I need to fight for the club, to be ready, because this is the biggest club in the world. For me, it was really good to speak about this.\"\nSo Man Utd fans, feel free to thank Ferdinand for the Yoro deal next time you spot him at a game.\nThe FA Cup win convinced Leny Yoro to sign for Man Utd\nYoro also cited the shock FA Cup final triumph over Manchester City at Wembley Stadium in May as a deciding factor in his eventual move to the north of England.\nHe revealed: \"When I saw the FA Cup win at the end of the season, for me, I really wanted to be with them because to win titles and celebrate with the fans - it's incredible.\"\nThe defender is certainly hungry for success at Man Utd.\nFriendship with Kobbie Mainoo\nYoro has only been at Man Utd for a few days, but it seems he's already made a few mates.\nOne of those new mates is fellow wonderkid Kobbie Mainoo, whom Yoro revealed he is already \"really close with\", citing the relationship as key to his bedding-in period in Manchester.\nNani comparison\nPerhaps the most random moment of the interview with MUTV was when Yoro revealed what player he was compared with while growing up in France.\n\"A lot of people compared me to Nani,\" revealed Yoro when discussing his formative years as an attacking player.\n\"It was because I was fast like him. I loved this player. For me, it was a target to be like him, but not it's not the same because I'm a defender,\" Yoro explained while laughing.",
