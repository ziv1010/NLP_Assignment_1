  "body_text": "The inaugural revamped and expanded FIFA Club World Cup kicks off at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens on Saturday night, but will the hosts or the expirence record-African champions prevail?\nAl Ahly vs Inter Miami preview\nCan Inter Miami make a winning start to this Club World Cup campaign? The Herons obviously boast a star-studded squad, picking up last year's MLS Supporters' Shield, setting the new single-season points record of 74 to achieve this. However, this campaign has not gone quite so well, with Javier Mascherano's team currently sixth in the overall standings, six points adrift the leaders.\nMiami were also dumped out the CONCACAF Champions Cup at the semi-final stage, smashed 5-1 by Vancouver Whitecaps in April, a massive blow as they were desperate to win that tournament. However, the Herons do at least come into this competition following successive wins, steamrollering CF Montréal 4-2 and then Columbus Crew 5-1, both in Fort Lauderdale, with a certain Lionel Messi bagging a brace in both. So now, will they start the Club World Cup with a victory?\nUnlike their opponents, who are debutants, Al Ahly are vastly experienced at Club World Cup level, with this the tenth time they've participated in the competition, second only to Auckland City. This is because the Red Devils are 12 times CAF Champions League winners, to go with the fact they are 45-times Egyptian champions, meaning they've picked up 126 major honours to date, making them the world's most successful football clubs, currently six clear of Celtic.\nLast season, Al Ahly did retain their Egyptian Premier League crown, but were eliminated by Mamelodi Sundowns in the semis of the CAF Champions League, despite having been in seven of the eight finals beforehand. Nevertheless, despite all their success at national and continental level, the Red Devils' Club World Cup record is mixed, winning only nine of 23 fixtures at the tournament, eliminated in three quarter-finals and six semi-finals. This time round, with Palmeiras and Porto completing Group A, all four sides will fancy their chances of advancing, so will there be a winner in South Florida?\nAl Ahly vs Inter Miami head-to-head record\nThese two clubs have never previously met.\nAl Ahly team news\nNew manager José Riveiro has been appointed ahead of this tournament, so is surely raring to go.\nFormer Aston Villa winger Trézéguet could make his debut, having arrived from Trabzonspor this month. Also, a new goalkeeper Mohamed Seha has signed, albeit captain Mohamed El-Shenawy remains the undisputed number one, but new midfielder Mohamed Ali Ben Romdhane, who has just joined from Hungarian champions Ferencváros, is expected to be thrown into the lineup.\nAl Ahly predicted lineup vs Inter Miami: (4-2-3-1): El-Shenawy; Hany, Ibrahim, El Aash, Nabil Koka; Romdhane, Attia, Ashour, Mohamed, Trézéguet; Abou Ali.\nAl Ahly player to watch vs Inter Miami\nEmam Ashour scored 19 goals this season, one of which came against Al Ain during last year's FIFA Intercontinental Cup, so will he make his mark on the global stage again?\nInter Miami team news\nJavier Mascherano is currently without the injured Jordi Alba, Gonzalo Luján, David Ruíz, Yannick Bright and Baltasar Rodríguez, meaning his options are limited. Meantime, in goal, first-choice goalkeeper Drake Callender has a groin issue, so veteran Óscar Ustari will continue to deputise.\nIn terms of who will feature out-field, Fafà Picault could return out-wide, having scored off the bench against Columbus, with Benjamín Cremaschi continuing to partner Sergio Busquets at the base of midfield. In attack meantime, Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez were both on target during the demolition of the Crew meaning, between them, they've now scored just the 1,444 goals for club and country.\nInter Miami predicted lineup vs Al Ahly: (4-4-1-1): Ustari; Weigandt, Martínez, Falcón, Allen; Busquets, Cremaschi, Allende, Picault; Messi, Suárez.\nInter Miami player to watch vs Al Ahly\nAs ever, there will be all eyes on Lionel Messi, who has previously scored five goals in five Club World Cup games, winning the competition three times, so can he fire Miami to victory here?\nAl Ahly vs Inter Miami prediction\nWe are backing Al Ahly to spoil the Miami party on Saturday night. The Herons have conceded three or more goals in six of their last nine outings, which has to be a concern, so, while Miami boast plenty of attacking firepower, we believe the Egyptian side will be too strong: Al Ahly 3-1 Inter Miami.\nAl Ahly vs Inter Miami FAQs - FIFA Club World Cup\nHow to watch Al Ahly vs Inter Miami FIFA Club World Cup game on TV channel?\nAl Ahly vs Inter Miami FIFA Club World Cup game will be available on the following TV channels;\n- UK: Channel 5 and DAZN UK\n- USA: TNT Sports, TUDN and DAZN USA.\n- Canada: DAZN Canada\nHow to watch Al Ahly vs Inter Miami FIFA Club World Cup game on live streaming?\nAl Ahly vs Inter Miami FIFA Club World Cup game will be available on the following streaming services;\n- UK: My5 and DAZN UK\n- USA: TNT Sports, TUDN and DAZN USA.\n- Canada: DAZN Canada\nWhat is the date and kick-off time for Al Ahly vs Inter Miami in the FIFA Club World Cup?\nAl Ahly vs Inter Miami takes place on Saturday 14 June 2025, with kick off at 1:00am (BST), 20:00 (EDT) & 17:00 (PDT).",
