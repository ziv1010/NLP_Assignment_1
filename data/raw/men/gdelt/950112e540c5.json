Full of confidence, the Liverpool star unleashed a rocket of a strike that flew into the top right corner.\nDonnarumma could not do anything about it he stood there watching the ball fly past him into the back of the net.\nWatch the stunning goal below:\nDominik Szoboszlai that is absolutely out of this world! WOW! ? pic.twitter.com/N17F24GJzG\n— Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) February 8, 2026\nLiverpool’s new set-piece expert\nThis moment of magic comes as no surprise to the Anfield faithful, who have watched Szoboszlai evolve into one of the deadliest dead-ball specialists in Europe this season.\nHe has already built a highlight reel of set-piece stunners during the 2025/26 campaign.\nFans will instantly recall his similar effort against Arsenal back in August, where he struck a magnificent winner past David Raya to secure a vital 1-0 victory.\nHe repeated the feat in the Champions League in January, netting a crucial free-kick against Marseille and curled one against Bournemouth.\nWith Trent no more at Anfield, Szoboszlai has fully assumed the mantle of Liverpool’s primary set-piece taker, proving time and again that he can decide the biggest matches with a single swing of his right boot.\nSzoboszlai has been Liverpool’s best player this season\nWhile his goals steal the headlines, Szoboszlai’s influence goes far beyond free-kicks.\nThe 25-year-old has arguably been the first name on Arne Slot’s team sheet, filling in everywhere from attacking midfield to right-back during an injury crisis earlier in the campaign.\nHis relentless pressing, creativity, and leadership have driven Liverpool’s title charge. Slot has frequently praised the midfielder’s “incredible” engine and mentality, citing him as the embodiment of the high-intensity style he wants to play.\nWhether winning the ball back deep in his own half or firing rockets into the top corner, Szoboszlai is currently playing the football of his life.",
