  "body_text": "Liverpool's potential Champions League opponents for last 16\n- Liverpool topped the Champions League league phase standings\n- Reds secured automatic progression to the last 16\n- Arne Slot's side can only face one of two sides in the next round\nLiverpool avoided the chaos of the Champions League play-off round over the past week but it won't be long before they return to Europe's premier competition.\nThe Reds still await knowledge of their last 16 opposition ahead of a tantalising two-legged tie in March but will have no fear heading into the next round after topping the inaugural league phase with seven wins from eight Champions League outings.\nThe Premier League leaders will be among the favourites to dethrone reigning champions Real Madrid and secure a seventh European Cup, but they will have to navigate a challenging last 16 duel if they are to taste continental glory.\nHere are the sides Liverpool could face in the Champions League round of 16.\nLiverpool's potential Champions League last 16 opponents\nLiverpool do not definitively know their last 16 opponents just yet but they will lock horns with one of two teams: Paris Saint-Germain or Benfica.\nThere was always a strong chance that Liverpool would face Ligue 1 opposition in their first European knockout tie under Arne Slot, with PSG facing surprise overachievers Brest in the play-off round. Monaco could have been potential opponents for the Reds as well based on league phase position, but they were beaten across two legs by Portuguese giants Benfica.\nLiverpool have faced the Lisbon side 14 times previously, most recently in 2021/22 en route to the final. They last battled with the Parisians in 2018/19 during the Champions League group stage.\nBest and worse case scenario\nIt's fairly obvious that Liverpool will want to avoid PSG in the last 16. The French side made an unconvincing start to their Champions League campaign but have since found their feet under Luis Enrique, who has forged a formidable team despite the exit of Kylian Mbappe over the summer.\nPSG scored 11 goals in their final three league phase outings to qualify for the play-off round and proceeded to beat Brest 10-0 on aggregate during their opening knockout tie. With Ousmane Dembele and Bradley Barcola in devastating form and the likes of Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Vitinha and Achraf Hakimi in support, Liverpool will desperately want to avoid the reigning Ligue 1 champions.\nDarwin Nunez's former employers Benfica would prove a much easier test for Liverpool, although ex-Wolverhampton Wanderers boss Bruno Lage has helped stabilise the Portuguese outfit since replacing Roger Schmidt earlier this term.\nThey have put four past Barcelona and Atletico Madrid in Europe this season - although they still somehow lost to the former - and beat Juventus in the league phase, too. They will still be awkward opponents for the Reds.\nWhen is the Champions League last 16 draw?\nLiverpool don't have to wait much longer to discover their fate, with the last 16 draw taking place at 11:00 GMT on Friday 21 February at the House of European Football in Nyon, Switzerland. The draw will be streamed live on UEFA's official website.\nThe Reds will play the first leg of their last 16 tie on 4-5 March and the reverse fixture at Anfield on 11-12 March.",
