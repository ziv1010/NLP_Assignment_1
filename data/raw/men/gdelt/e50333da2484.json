At 19 years old she has delivered in a major tournament twice in just a handful of appearances.\nOn Tuesday evening, she was once more in the right place at the right time and showed maturity beyond her years to finish with aplomb.\nIn a performance where England were all too often too hasty with their final ball, rushed passes and shots. With a performance that was veering towards head loss, Agyemang brought a calm in the box.\nDespite being the youngest player on the pitch, when Beth Mead cut the ball back into her path, she waited a second before placing her shot past Giuliani.\nGood morning everyone - from our #WEURO25 finalists 🤗 pic.twitter.com/UKZx2e1nus\n— Lionesses (@Lionesses) July 23, 2025\nIt was with just four minutes of extra time remaining that Agyemang came millimetres away from turning from hero to legend.\nBreaking free of the Italy defence she showed her strength to fire a deliberately clipped shot towards the goal that dipped to hit the crossbar and rebound off.\nAgyemang is not a star in the making but a star already shining the brightest in the Lionesses’ constellation.\nChloe Kelly is clutch\nIt was not an all-time performance from Chloe Kelly and yet she still picked up the official Player of the Match award.\nThe scenario was exactly what you would expect of a player of Kelly’s mentality.\nShunned at Manchester City this season, leaving her in a place where she considered quitting football, Kelly forced a move to Arsenal to rejuvenate her England hopes.\nDespite the doubters, in north London she thrived. She would not only force her way into a strong starting XI but start as Arsenal won the Champions League after defeating Barcelona.\nHaving been named on the bench for all of England's games at Euro 2025 so far, she came on once more to prove her worth.\nAgainst Sweden, that had shown in the form of two brilliant assists/pre-assists to set-up England’s comeback.\nOn Wednesday that contribution shifted because while her crossing was not up to scratch, noticeably putting a corner straight into the side-netting with minutes left, she stepped up to take a potentially game-winning penalty.\nDespite seeing her first attempt saved, she was on hand to show that resilience again, and power home the rebound.\nIt marks a second time the winger has given England an historic 2-1 win in extra-time, having been the scorer of the winner at Wembley back in 2022.",
