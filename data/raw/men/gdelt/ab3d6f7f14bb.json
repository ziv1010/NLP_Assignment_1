Claiming Spain's third international trophy would be a proud moment for the likes of Jenni Hermoso and Laia Aleixandri, former Atletico players.\n\"I get goosebumps because we are going to be with the whole family and all the people who will come to support us,\" said Aleixandri.\n'Things to adjust'\nTo defend the Nations League trophy they won last year in the first ever edition of the competition, Spain must step up a gear or two.\nBermudez replaced Montse Tome at the helm after Spain finished as runners up to England at Euro 2025.\nA 5-0 aggregate victory over Sweden in the Nations League semi-finals showed promise, but the visit to Germany was a reminder that many teams are snapping at their heels.\nThat is something Spain's Barcelona stars saw last season as Arsenal caused an upset by beating them in the Champions League final, following years of domination.\nSpain were also uncharacteristically slack, perhaps unable to shake off the comforting thought of the second leg at home to come.\nBut Germany coach Christian Wueck said that the first leg had proved that \"we cannot only compete but even play our own game against a team like Spain\", although he admitted his frustration at not securing the victory.\nSpain had 56 percent of possession, down from their usual level of control, while they suffocated under close marking from the Germans.\nSpain's coach Bermudez said that her team would have to improve in the second leg.\n\"We didn't play our best match and there are things to adjust,\" she explained, later adding that the team needed to be more \"incisive\" and generate more in attack in Madrid.\nThat fluid, attacking football is what the fans who will flood to the Metropolitano are expecting to see, along with Spain's golden generation lifting another trophy.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
