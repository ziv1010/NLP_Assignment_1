However, he won’t be hanging around to play Championship football with the player hoping to be part of the England squad at the 2024 European Championships.\nAnd with just a year left on his deal, Leicester know it will be virtually impossible to keep Maddison at the King Power.\nIt’s easy to see why the 26-year-old will be in such high demand. On a personal level, he enjoyed his best-ever season scoring 10 goals and adding nine assists for the doomed Foxes.\nThe likes of Tottenham and Newcastle are both reportedly on his trail, with Leicester looking for a fee of around £50m.\nHowever, the star would be eager to play Champions League football, ruling Spurs out the equation.\nAnd amid claims the player prefers a move to London over the North-East, trusted transfer journalist Fabrizio Romano has shared what he knows.\n“Maddison is 100 per cent leaving the club,” Romano told the Here We Go podcast. “Let me mention Newcastle because Newcastle love the player, Newcastle really appreciate him. They are in the race again and he is another player appreciated by Arsenal.\nThese two clubs are interested in the situation of Maddison and I’m sure there will be a fight for this player.”\nArsenal want Maddison and Sacha Boey\nNow the Daily Mirror claims Arsenal are ready to launch a bid worth £40m. And they plan to free up space in their squad by allowing Emile Smith Rowe to depart.\nThe homegrown academy talent – hugely popular among the Arsenal faithful – struggled for game-time this season, failing to start a single game in his 14 appearances. A move to Aston Villa is reportedly on the cards.\nAnd while the signing of Maddison would be an obvious upgrade, Arsenal might need to raise their bid to see a deal accepted. Indeed, their opening £40m offer is likely to be waved off. And with Leicester seeking £50m, a fee in the region of £45m could see an agreement reached.\nThe Gunners are also want to sign a new right-back this summer and have long been on the trail of Ivan Fresneda.\nHowever, competition for the Spanish teenager is tough, with Borussia Dortmund among those also keen.\nNow, according to Turkish outlet Turkiye Gazetesi, the Gunners are launching a €20m (£17.2m) opening bid for Sacha Boey.\nThe France Under-21 international looks a huge talent, drawing interest from the likes of Liverpool and Barcelona.\nHowever, it is the Gunners who have made the first move for the 22-year-old, who has appeared in 50 games this season.\nAnd the report claims Arsenal are ‘determined to finalise the transfer’, making Boey their first signing of the summer.\nLIVERPOOL LOOKING TO HIJACK DAICHI KAMADA DEAL\nReports in Italy claim Liverpool are making a late play to beat AC Milan to the signing of Daichi Kamada.\nThe Japan playmaker, 26, is leaving Eintracht Frankfurt this summer after falling out of contract at the Bundesliga club.\nDemand for his services is high after a brilliant season saw him score 16 times and add another six assists.\nAfter links to the likes of Barcelona, Newcastle and Tottenham, it appears a move to AC Milan looks likely instead.\nAnd following talks, the star’s agent has reportedly reached an agreement to sign for the Rossoneri this summer.\nHe will reportedly sign a three-year deal at the San Siro, worth €3m a year – around £52,000 a week.\nHowever, Milan are not in the clear yet and Calciomercato reports that Liverpool are looking to hijack the deal.\nClaiming the deal is still awaiting finalisation, Liverpool have reportedly ‘not lost hope’ of signing Kamada themselves.\nAnd noting that the Merseysiders are ‘capable of putting’ a ‘more important’ offer on the table, there appears a real fear in Milan that Liverpool will pinch his signing.\nJurgen Klopp is looking to add more goals to his midfield next season. And while they remain close on Alexis Mac Allister, there are claims that Kamada could well be next.\nREAD MORE: ‘He’s ready to go’ – Liverpool star backed to ditch Klopp with Tottenham, Brighton offers expected\nEVERTON PLOTTING MOVE FOR TAMMY ABRAHAM\nEverton want to add potency to their attack next season by sealing the £27.5m signing of England striker Tammy Abraham.\nThe striker has enjoyed an excellent couple of seasons with Roma. However, he could not prevent them losing Wednesday’s Europa League final, coming off in the second half.\nAll the same, the 25-year-old has registered 36 goals in 105 matches for Roma.\nHowever, the bulk of those goals came last season when he netted 27 times. This season, his tally has failed to reach double figures, netting on just nine occasions.\nAs such, Roma are reportedly open to offers for the former Chelsea man.\nNow, according to The Sun, Sean Dyche is keen to bring the 11-times capped England international to Everton.\nThe Toffees were the lowest scorers in the Premier League last season, scoring just 34 goals. No longer able to rely on injury-prone Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Dyche is desperate to bring more firepower to Goodison.\nAnd with finances tight at Roma, they are reportedly open to the sale of Abraham.\nA £27.5m (€32m) opening offer for Abraham, though, will likely get waved away.\nThey paid £34m to Chelsea for him two summers ago and will not want to make a loss. But an improved offer which matches Roma’s initial investment could yet clinch his signing.\nREAD MORE: Everton ‘make contact’ with 16-goal Brazilian striker as Sean Dyche begins squad rebuild",
