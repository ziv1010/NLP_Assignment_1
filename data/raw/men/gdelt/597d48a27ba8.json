  "body_text": "He is a funny guy, Ruben Dias. One day he is giving LinkedIn-worthy answers in press conferences, the next he is putting all of his clean-eating, positive-thinking methodologies into a commanding Champions League performance for the ages.\nIt is easy to roll your eyes when you hear something like, “We did not lose the final, we just took a step closer”, as Dias said on Monday of City’s 1-0 defeat to Chelsea two years ago, but you cannot fault the application of a man who is undoubtedly one of the cornerstones of Pep Guardiola’s latest would-be world beaters.\nAdvertisement\nWhether they ever win the big trophy under this manager remains to be seen and nobody is counting their chickens when arch-omelette makers Real Madrid are still around, but City once again showed they are right up there with the best teams of the modern era with a 3-0 dismantling of Bayern Munich.\nThey were breathtaking in the way they added their second and third goals, blitzing teams in a way that, in the past, teams have blitzed them. City seem to have an edge to their game when it comes to European football this season and it is not purely down to Erling Haaland. If you try to play your way out from the back, City will take it off you. If you leave any kind of space in your back line, City will rampage through you. It’s not all passes and control.\n“It is what it is and what’s done is done,” Dias shrugged on Monday when asked how City have arrived at this blistering form considering they looked a shadow of themselves in January. But there was a bit more: “All of us have a special feeling, a special taste when it comes to this stage.”\nThat really does ring true.\nYet it could have been different. Guardiola said he was “emotionally destroyed” afterwards and it was not one of those City games where they bossed everything.\nBayern are, admittedly, a little blunt in the final third, a bit like the few occasions in the period between Sergio Aguero and Haaland when City played well without a striker but could not score, but the Germans are still very good indeed.\nThe problem for Thomas Tuchel’s side was that when they did do pretty much everything right in the box, Dias got in the way.\nAt 0-0, Jamal Musiala picked his spot and sent Ederson the wrong way, but Dias stuck out a leg and thwarted the effort as it was heading for the bottom corner.\nWithin a few moments, it was 1-0 to City thanks to Rodri’s stunning left-foot strike. It was that kind of first half.\nRODRI’S FIRST-EVER #UCL GOAL 🤯\nUnreal strike from the Man City midfielder 🚀 pic.twitter.com/u7F8p3uQna\n— Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) April 11, 2023\nAt the start of the second half, it looked as though the Bayern equaliser was coming. Leroy Sane sent a series of threatening corners into the box, Kingsley Coman headed the ball goalwards and, yep, Dias was in the way.\nAdvertisement\nLater on, as Bayern broke forward again (that’s why Guardiola was destroyed) and Serge Gnabry barrelled into the box, Dias jockeyed him all the way and produced the perfect block tackle in the area.\nJoshua Kimmich later fired off a long-ranger and, sure enough, Dias blocked that one, too.\nIn fairness, the 25-year-old was not alone back there. Ederson swept up well and made good saves, particularly from Sane, and if Dias was magnificent, so was Nathan Ake. Did either of them put a foot wrong?\nWhat about Manuel Akanji or the actual player of the match, John Stones? Maybe the Braveheart centre-back displays are easier to grasp than the Beckenbauer ones, but there is beauty in what Dias does, too.\nAnd it may be an oversimplification, but it is a credible theory that Dias helps pull those around him together in a way others cannot. That seemed to be the case when he arrived in 2020 as Vincent Kompany’s belated replacement and duly won the football writers’ player of the year award.\nIt has always felt like his constant shouting, encouraging and, maybe, messages left on sticky notes on his team-mates’ lockers saying things like “always see the positive in the bad” might just be what an otherwise quiet group of defenders need.\nAlways see the positive in the bad. Important time to rest the mind and get ready for what’s coming! 🔋✌🏼 pic.twitter.com/OOxXwCgVnN\n— Rúben Dias (@rubendias) March 23, 2022\nEarlier this season, he looked much less like that commanding presence, though. Arguably, he had dropped to the bottom of the five-man pecking order. After the World Cup, where he played through injury for Portugal, he could not get back into the side for a few weeks.\nThen suddenly he was back and immediately back to his best. There is definitely more to it, but, within a couple of games, City were back to their best, too.\nAdvertisement\nThe way he looks after himself, the way he constantly talks to his team-mates, on the pitch and off, is needed in a team that even those on the inside concede is a little short of traditional leaders.\nAnd consider this: Joao Cancelo was booed by the City fans when he came on for Bayern after the circumstances of his loan move to Germany. He was grumpy, he complained, he did not like being on the sidelines and his performances suffered.\nCompare that to Dias. His first-one-in-last-one-out approach is at the other end of the spectrum and there is plenty of room in the middle — it is not like his team-mates need to go about saying things like “if you can dream it you can achieve it” — but it clearly works for Dias.\nAnd if it works for Dias, it works for City. One step closer, indeed.\n(Top photo: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)",
