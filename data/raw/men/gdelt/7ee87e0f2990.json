  "body_text": "Crystal Palace are bracing themselves for the summer departure of Eberechi Eze, according to reports.\nThe Eagles already face a difficult summer with star forward Michael Olise on the verge of joining German giants Bayern Munich, having previously been linked with Chelsea.\nAccording to the Telegraph, Olise was swayed by the prospect of playing Champions League football at the Allianz Arena, as well as working with Bayern’s new head coach Vincent Kompany.\nCrystal Palace braced for Eze departure\nDespite a promising start under new head coach Oliver Glasner last season, the Eagles may face a tough first full campaign under the Austrian in 2024/25.\nWith Olise already exiting, GIVEMESPORT now report that Eze could be the next attacking star out of the door.\nTheir report states that ‘key personnel’ at Palace are worried that Eze will see Olise’s departure as a step backwards for the club and that he could use the transfer as a means to engineer his own exit from Selhurst Park.\nLosing Olise this summer is bad enough for Palace, but to see both him and Eze leave in one go would be disastrous.\nThe two attacking stars scored 36.8% (21) of Palace’s 57 Premier League goals in 2023/24, while occupying the top two spots among Eagles players in a number of key metrics, including chances created and shots on target.\nEze is currently on international duty with England at Euro 2024 in Germany.",
