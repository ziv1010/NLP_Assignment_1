  "body_text": "Everton have re-signed Jack Harrison on loan from Leeds United.\nFor a second successive season, the Blues have taken advantage of a clause in the Stoke-born player's contract at Elland Road allowing him to sign on loan for a Premier League club while Leeds remain in the Championship.\nThe Yorkshire side were relegated from the top flight at the end of the 2022-23 season and failed to gain promotion this season when they were defeated by Southampton in the play-offs final at Wembley last month.\nThe deal allows for Everton to sign him on loan for the year with no fee but the Club will cover his wages. It is not clear whether the agreement includes an option to sign Harrison on a permanent basis next year.\nHarrison first joined Everton in August last year but had to wait to make his debut because of a prolonged hip injury.\nHe eventually made his first appearance in a Blue jersey in late September in the Carabao Cup win at Aston Villa, the team he might have joined were it not for that injury, and went on to play 35 games in all competitions.\nHis first loan officially ended at the end of the 2023-24 campaign but, having settled on Merseyside, it was always his desire to return to Goodison Park if possible for a further year this summer.\n“It’s a great honour to be part of the last season at Goodison,\" he told evertontv from Miami where is preparing for the new season. \"It's a club with a lot of history and you see how many fans have packed out the stadium for such a long time.\n“I'm definitely excited. I always remember Goodison Park having a great atmosphere at games. Being part of it last year, especially moments like the win over Liverpool under the lights, the big win over Newcastle, as well – the atmosphere was bouncing and it's such a pleasure to be part of that.\n\"The last season at Goodison Park has to be a special one for everybody and we'll definitely be wanting to make the most of those games like last year and create more memories.\n“We can take confidence from last season but I think there’s a lot we can improve upon, as well. I know defensively we were very sound last season, but on the attacking end I want to be able to add more to the team and improve my numbers with goals and assists.\n“I know I have a lot more to offer. That's extra motivation for me to go back and prove to myself and to Everton Football Club that I can do more on the pitch. This season I'll be able to have a full pre-season and hopefully hit the ground running.”\nReader Comments (57)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

However, £4.5m in wages for a very average, albeit hardworking, winger seems a waste of a loan slot and a waste of a lot of money.\nSo currently, we've re-signed Coleman, Young and Harrison. Former two should really only be back up and the latter hopefully isnt the starting RMâ€¦.\nStill 7 weeks to the season start I guessâ€¦.\n14 Posted 24/06/2024 at 18:01:55\nIf money was there then maybe we could bring better onboard. Harrison is a experienced Premier League player who in my opinion a few other Clubs wouldn't mind having in there squad.\nFor every Harrison there are a few Benrahma's who look may look good on youtube but offer little to a struggling side.\n15 Posted 24/06/2024 at 18:02:35\n16 Posted 24/06/2024 at 18:18:07\nHe's actually got a few good attributes and his work ethic can't be faulted. Hopefully he'll improve this year.\n17 Posted 24/06/2024 at 18:25:30\n18 Posted 24/06/2024 at 18:30:50\n19 Posted 24/06/2024 at 18:32:10\n20 Posted 24/06/2024 at 18:59:32\nNo brainer to get him back.\nThere's attacking returns in there for anyone who bothered to watch him under Bielsa.\nProblem is he's got a walking disaster behind him on the right.\nHe's not going to fire us into the champions league places, but all we're looking for is a stress free season finishing 10th-14th. Then hopefully we can kick on.\n21 Posted 24/06/2024 at 19:03:40\n22 Posted 24/06/2024 at 19:05:43\n23 Posted 24/06/2024 at 19:12:19\n24 Posted 24/06/2024 at 19:13:52\n25 Posted 24/06/2024 at 19:29:56\nGive him someone to work off of rather than an isolated role and we will see some better performances. He cannot create space on his own but knows the proper channels to run and can occasionally produce opportunities. Another player needed for overall strength of squad.\n26 Posted 24/06/2024 at 19:47:58\n27 Posted 24/06/2024 at 20:07:04\n28 Posted 24/06/2024 at 20:16:11\n29 Posted 24/06/2024 at 20:21:12\nHarrison pisses me off as well at times but we havent got a player who doesn't. When one of your best passes of the ball is a centreback I don't see a problem with this its low risk. Harrison or a player who's played for 6 or 7 Clubs and produced in a piss poor league.\n30 Posted 24/06/2024 at 20:47:10\nKarl # 29, Leeds are letting him go in order to subsidise his wages - not because they don't rate him.\nBrian # 23, goals can come in greater number if we can improve some of the other key positions - especially RB and the (sort of) number 10 position Doucoure plays. Ndiaye looks like he might be the latter.\n31 Posted 24/06/2024 at 20:53:56\nIf the lad wants to play for us and is committed, thats.' good with me. Dyche will pick his players and team.\nNot long until 17th August\n32 Posted 24/06/2024 at 21:13:07\n33 Posted 24/06/2024 at 21:16:03\n34 Posted 24/06/2024 at 21:19:10\n35 Posted 24/06/2024 at 21:29:21\nWhether or not he surprises the doubters this season I don't know. But the added pre-season plus full health will make a difference. Who knows what kind of pliers we'll surround him with to give him a better chance of contributing offensively.\nCertainly this signing is somewhat a product of where we are financially as a club, but I also think he's a better player than most on here give him credit for. Plus he works hard for the shirt and wants to be here. Along with his history of contributing to goals and his defensive work rate, that's all good enough for me.\n36 Posted 24/06/2024 at 21:49:55\nAh well.\n37 Posted 24/06/2024 at 22:02:02\nGlad we didn't have to buy him.\nGlad we're looking at other options in his position.\n38 Posted 24/06/2024 at 22:02:43\n39 Posted 24/06/2024 at 22:05:16\n40 Posted 24/06/2024 at 22:15:25\n41 Posted 24/06/2024 at 22:57:52\n42 Posted 24/06/2024 at 23:11:08\nI think he will really benefit from a Dyche pre-season and I expect him to return better attacking numbers this year.\nCan play RW, LW and behind the striker. Extremely hard working and suits the managers game plan to a tee. Great to get him in early and helps team consistency whilst allowing us room to spend transfer funds elsewhere.\n43 Posted 24/06/2024 at 23:18:37\n44 Posted 24/06/2024 at 23:24:29\n45 Posted 25/06/2024 at 00:52:41\nHow James Rodriguez has returned as Colombia's midfield maestro while utterly disappearing from club football -- currently sitting unwanted on the end of the bench at Sao Paulo.\nhttps://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/40267466/can-colombias-james-rodriguez-quiet-critics-2024-copa-america\n46 Posted 25/06/2024 at 01:29:34\n47 Posted 25/06/2024 at 04:28:50\nHe also served up a perfect third for our old friend Yerry that drew a penalty, which was unfortunately overturned.\n48 Posted 25/06/2024 at 05:12:00\nA full pre-season for him and all the squad could be a tremendous thing to enable us to start fit and firing.\nPerformance (not results) wise, we seemed very strong in the first part of the season. Very short of goals though, weren't we?\nPerhaps Dele Alli will get a full pre-season and stay? If the takeover can get done in time, maybe we could get PSR sorted by letting Onana go, he seems to want away anyway, though that may change now we should be upwardly mobile post takeover.\nProbably unrealistic to think James Rodriguez could return, to give us a real top quality cutting edge and sparkling creativity. What a play maker, what a player. He knows us and loves us, we love him, could Dan Friedkin make it happen.\nDoes he have 2 plus top quality seasons left, to dance on the Goodison Turf to light her up in this last season? Could he be the sparkling diamond to bring unbounded joy first season at Bramley-Moore Dock?\n49 Posted 25/06/2024 at 05:48:52\n50 Posted 25/06/2024 at 06:22:40\n51 Posted 25/06/2024 at 07:05:39\nTaken on by Liverpool and then Manchester United academies. Also played out in the US.\nOn the crossing side, you are looking at a left footed player, being mostly put on the right side. I've never been a fan of that. But we have McNeil, who's delivery I mostly good.\nI'm happy that he's staying. More thinking about how we bolster that midfield.\n52 Posted 25/06/2024 at 07:25:53\nPersonally, I prefer to use the Tongue in Groove type. ;-)\n53 Posted 25/06/2024 at 09:08:54\nWhich, of course was won by Olympique Marseilles, the only worrying aspect being that he only managed 4 in 46 for them. Hopefully down to style of (their) play and missing playing in England.\nNot being a harbinger of doom, prolific scorers don't usually just 'dry up' unless they have just hit a bad patch, I am hoping that may be the case here. Welcome aboard lad !\n54 Posted 25/06/2024 at 09:28:38\nIt appears that the signings made so far are part of a short-medium term strategy to ensure we are comfortably mid-table but in a stable and sustainable way.\nOnce achieved, next phase â€“ qualify for Europe through the league then who knows, perhaps Champions League in say 5 -7 years?\n55 Posted 25/06/2024 at 10:55:42\n56 Posted 25/06/2024 at 23:12:29\n57 Posted 26/06/2024 at 11:12:30\nNot.\nOk he is back.\nEnough about him has been said previously in this and previous threads so there is no point in me adding more, other than he will get my 100% support and love.\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
