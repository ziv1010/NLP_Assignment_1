  "body_text": "It looked like a certainty that Jadon Sancho will leave Manchester United this summer but a move away from the club has still not materialised.\nThe English winger had a public fallout with manager Erik ten Hag last season and he was then sent out on loan to Borussia Dortmund, where he impressed with his performances.\nSancho helped Dortmund reach the Champions League final, where they lost against Real Madrid.\nParis Saint-Germain, Juventus and Barcelona have been linked with a move for the attacking player but with less than one week left in the transfer window to shut down, he is still a Man United player.\nTransfer specialist Fabrizio Romano has provided the latest update on the future of the Man United player and the status of his potential move away from the club.\nRomano exclusively told GiveMeSport:\n“It’s a 50/50 situation from what I’m hearing, there is still a good chance he stays at Manchester United, but the situation is still open. From what I’m hearing, for example, yesterday, the agents of Sancho were approached by Juventus.\n“PSG spoke to the agents of the player at the end of July, beginning of August, but then never sent an official bid, or never approached Manchester United. So PSG are not pushing on this one.\n“For Sancho, I think he’s still an open story, an open race. Let’s see what Juventus decide to do and let’s see if other clubs can jump into the race. But I think for Sancho, we have to be attentive till the end of the transfer window.”\nJadon Sancho needs a move away from Man United\nAs per the update provided by Romano, Sancho could stay at Man United this summer.\nThe winger will not be getting enough playing time this season as he is way down the pecking order at the club.\nThe club’s wide positions are decided as seen in the first match of the season against Fulham.\nA move away from Old Trafford would personally benefit Sancho as he could play regular football and become a starter elsewhere.\nMan United and the player would be hoping that a late move materialises for the winger.",
