Benoit Badiashile was shifted out of his role in the centre to take up Colwill’s role on the left.\nAfter a goalless draw in west London, their fourth round contest will head to a replay at Villa Park.\nOffering an update on Colwill in his post-match press conference, Pochettino said: ‘We don’t believe it is so bad.
