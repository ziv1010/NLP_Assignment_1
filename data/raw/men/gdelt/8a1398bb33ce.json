However, his second season in charge has not gone entirely to plan and the Liverpool boss had to negotiate a seriously tricky autumn in which the Reds fell off the title pace and left his job at Anfield in some pretty significant jeopardy.\nWhile the chances of Liverpool retaining their Premier League title now look to have slipped away, they have returned to some sort of form in recent weeks and, now up to fourth in the Premier League table, are unbeaten in nine matches across all competitions.\nHowever, the Reds are way off their free-flowing best that saw them sweep their way to title glory last season and, after spending a whopping £440m (€505m, $600m) on new players over the summer, questions have been raised over both his long-term future at Anfield and the identity of the team he has created.\nNow, in a furious response to questions on his footballing philosophy, Slot, speaking after Sunday’s topsy-turvy 2-2 draw at Fulham, has hit back at his critics.\n“Yes, I would love us to create more from ball possession,” Slot told reporters after Liverpool were pegged back late by the Cottagers, despite boasting 58% possession at Craven Cottage.\n“I can tell you this, my philosophy of football hasn’t changed this year compared to all the seasons I was a manager before, but we have to do it with the players that we have available.\n“And I think today, 11 very good football players were on the pitch, maybe not all of them in their normal position, but in the first half, they controlled the game.\n“Just before they scored, we had exactly the same chance from Cody Gakpo, which went on the other side of the post.\n“And in the second half, two disallowed goals, two goals scored, a header on the bar. So things to like, but the result is, again, not what we may deserve, question mark.”\nWant breaking transfer lines from original sources?

But we don’t have eight attackers, so that’s not possible.”\nLiverpool latest: Carragher rips apart ‘lazy’ star; Real Madrid chase ‘dominant’ Reds ace\nMeanwhile, Ibrahima Konate’s mistake during the 2-2 draw at Fulham has led to savage criticism from Jamie Carragher, while a second Liverpool player has also been questioned.\nBefore the Fulham clash, Carragher had also criticised Konate’s team-mate Milos Kerkez, with the pundit taking aim at Slot’s rotation policy with Andy Robertson.\nOn the transfer front, Juventus are preparing an initial loan bid to sign a Liverpool player whose exit is speculated every single window, and a report has explained why a deal is now ‘finally possible’.\nIn other news, a shock report out of Spain claims Real Madrid have bid €120m / £104.5m for a ‘dominant’ Liverpool star, who despite reservations, the Reds are considering selling.\nElsewhere, Liverpool are understood to have cooled their interest in signing a player Slot once famously branded a “cool customer” as the Reds pursue other targets instead and leaving Newcastle free to secure the star down to a big-money deal.",
