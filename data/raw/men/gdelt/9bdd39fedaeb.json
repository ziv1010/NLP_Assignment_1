If you want to buy now, and only get the player in January, we can start talking… Or if you want to wait until December, we can talk in December.”\nHe added: “There is an agreement between us, with the player and agent, that he would stay until the [Andre] end of the year.\nIt now seems, however, that Arsenal could scupper Liverpool’s plans and make their own offer for Andre.\nEURO PAPER TALK: Postecoglou intensifies Tottenham bid to sign red-hot Mexican striker; Liverpool ‘in talks’ with Bundesliga sensation\nArsenal poised to rival Liverpool for Andre\nAccording to a recent report from Football Insider, Arsenal could ‘hijack’ Liverpool’s approach of Andre ‘if they are able to move on some first-teamers in January.’\nThey state that ‘it is believed the likes of Jorginho and Thomas Partey are the subject of interest and could move on in the mid-season window.’\nPartey has fallen down the pecking order at the Emirates since the arrival of Declan Rice. Juventus hold a long-standing interest in Partey, as well as several Saudi Arabian clubs, so they could come in for him in January.\nAs for Jorginho, he has started Arsenal’s last two Premier League games but with his contract set to expire at the end of the season, Mikel Arteta is open to moving him on this winter if he can find a replacement. Barcelona have been heavily linked with the Italy star in recent weeks.\nIf Partey and Jorginho are sold by Arsenal, they may well ‘hijack’ Liverpool’s move for Andre.\nInterestingly, Gabby Agbonlahor recently claimed that the Gunners would be a better fit for the 22-year-old Brazil international.\n“I would say Arsenal are a more attractive option for someone like Andre,” Agbonlahor told Football Insider. “They’re playing Champions League football, they’re higher in the league.\n“They’re London-based, which is another key factor. At the moment, I’d say Arsenal are more attractive.”\nWith that in mind, it will be interesting to see if Arsenal do make a concrete bid for Andre in January, as the reports suggest.\nREAD MORE: Fabrizio Romano reveals Arteta crucial in preventing damaging Arsenal exit amid Euro giant swoop",
