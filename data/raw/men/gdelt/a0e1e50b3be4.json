  "body_text": "Egypt international striker Ahmed Hassan Kouka believes that he didn’t have the chance to prove himself with the national team.\nIn April, Kouka had suffered a severe knee injury during his team’s Alanyaspor match against its counterpart Umranispor in the Turkish Premier League competition, which lead him to miss the rest of the season.\nAs a result, he was dropped from the Egypt squad for the June camp that faced both Guinea and South Sudan, winning both games.\nThe striker however would hope he get a chance to represent the Pharaohs in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations set to take place in Ivory Coast next January.\nThe 30-year-old striker hadn’t made the 2022 AFCON squad nor the 2018 World Cup one, but was part of the 2017 & 2019 AFCONs.\nSpeaking about missing these competitions, Kouka said: “I did not get my full chance with the Egyptian national team. When you perform well and consistently with your club in Europe, you should play more with the national team.\n“However, I never got two or three matches as a starter, and sometimes I feel that my exclusion from the Egyptian national team is not related to football but due to lack of media support for me.\n“With the national team, we may play 6 or 7 matches in the entire season, and I only start in one of them.\n“In the European season, I play 40 or 50 matches, so comparing the national team’s season with clubs is not appropriate, and I cannot prove myself when I don’t play from the start.\n“I never imagined being excluded from the World Cup squad because I was present in all the matches with Cuper before the tournament, and it was an unexpected shock.\n“I cannot talk about the reasons for my exclusion because if I did, people would be shocked and Cuper told me that there was someone who requested your absence.\n“After the World Cup, I received very big offers from Egypt and Saudi Arabia, but I chose to join Olympiacos because it is a big club in Greece and consistently play in the UEFA Champions League,” he added.",
