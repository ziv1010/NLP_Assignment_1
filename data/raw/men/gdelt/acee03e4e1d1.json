one for 'drunk and disorderly behaviour and assaulting an emergency worker' and the second relating to an 'incident where a woman was subjected to racial abuse'.\nSeveral hundred metres away in Whitehall, a static counter-demonstration had been set up by Stand Up To Racism.\nSpeaker Zak Cochrane led chants of 'Nazi scum off our streets' and 'say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here'.\nOthers held placards reading 'oppose Tommy Robinson' and 'stop fascists and the far-right'.\nStand Up To Racism said in a statement its members would 'stand together against attempts to divide us'.\nBarricades were set up to separate the square from Whitehall in order to prevent the opposing groups from coming together.\nSeveral thousand people turned out to see Robinson's documentary airing his grievances against the police today.\nThe far-right activist said the event was about 'celebrating...our culture and values' while his Urban Scoop 'independent journalism' website said it would be a 'brilliant and peaceful pro British event'.\nBut a grinning Robinson led the procession carrying a banner bearing the face of Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and the slogan: 'This is London, not Londonistan'.\nAfter the presentation, he aired video messages from conspiracy theorists, anti-vaccine campaigners and far-right activists, some of whom who spouted Islamophobic conspiracy theories.\nScotland Yard says some of the protesters have a history of being involved in violent disorder, while others are associated with what it called 'hooligan groups'. A 'number of people', the Met said, were drunk, with hours of the event left to go.\nPolice have also appealed for calm amidst the large number of football fans in the capital for the Champions League Final tonight.\nPeople take part in a protest march through London, organised by Tommy Robinson, real name is Stephen Yaxley Lennon\nGroups from across the UK linked to football disorder are expected to attend the event the Metropolitan Police said\nProtester with a small England flag sticker on his forehead joins the crowd as it marches through the capital\nProtesters arrive in London for a protest march, expected to be heavily policed by the Met\nMembers of the public gather in Whitehall to protest against Tommy Robinson and The English Defence League\nRobinson claimed his livestream on X, formerly Twitter, was being viewed by 542,000 people\nSome members of the crowd set off smoke flares and air horns as they marched down Millbank.\nAt Parliament Square, Robinson took to the stage where he was applauded and cheered by supporters.\nDecked out in Stone Island, the 41-year-old was joined by actor Laurence Fox who told the crowd: 'I am proud to be British. The most important freedom of all is the freedom to speak our minds. We must protect our right to speak above all other rights.'\n'British lives with British values matter too', he said. To huge cheers, he said: 'This is our country.'\nA woman then sang a version of Emeli Sande's Read All About It - to which Robinson said: 'That's beautiful, mate.'\nBritish right-wing YouTuber and former UKIP member Carl Benjamin called for the crowd to take a 'wholesome message to the British people'.\nBenjamin is a one-time European election candidate who once told Labour MP Jess Phillips: 'I wouldn't even rape you'.\nHe said: 'We have real problems, none of the mainstream parties are going to solve these problems we are going to have to do it ourselves.\n'But we have to remember the conduct of one depends the fate of all. You have to remember your dignity as an English man and woman is on the line and worthy of the respect of your ancestors.\n'Those glorious ancestors of ours are watching and they want us to win and we have to win for our children.\n'We need to take a wholesome message to the British people - we are going to do this.'\nRobinson carried a banner bearing the slogan 'This is London, not Londonistan' - featuring an image of London's Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan\nCounter-protesters from Stand Up To Racism gathered on Whitehall. Police set up barricades between the two groups to prevent them coming together\nPolice set up barriers on Whitehall to prevent protesters from each side from coming together\nPolice form a guard behind the barricades on Whitehall ahead of Tommy Robinson's rally\nA man sells Union and England flags outside the Houses of Parliament as supporters of Tommy Robinson filtered into Parliament Square\nSeveral thousand people are believed to have attended the rally - but the numbers are thought to have fallen away as the film screening continued\nA man cosplays as an English crusader on Parliament Square after marching from Victoria Station for Tommy Robinson's rally\nObservers say around 3,000 people are in attendance at the far-right event - at which the Met says it has recognised people with a history of being involved in violent disorder\nEnthusiasm for Robinson's film appeared to wane as it ran on. At 3.13pm, the Met issued a message to those leaving the protest, advising them to head back towards Victoria Station as other avenues were blocked off.\nNick Lowles, managing director of Hope Not Hate, said in a tweet: 'Tommy Robinson's film is being screened but the crowd is thinning fast. Many of those who remain and talking amongst themselves... And there is still a lot of the film to go.'\nUndeterred, Robinson said over 360,000 people were watching a live stream of the rally on X, formerly Twitter, adding: 'And the mainstream media thought we were finished.'\nLaurence Fox, the actor turned right-wing activist, later said '500,000 (are) watching live'.\nHowever, view counts for live videos on X tot up the total number of views on the stream since it began, rather than the number of people viewing at any one time.\nX's own documentation states that a 'view' is added when someone watches a video for as little as two seconds - and this includes 'autoplay' views when at least 50 percent of the video is in view on a user's screen as they scroll past.\nFox, who ruined his bid to run for London mayor after failing to fill out the forms properly, also claimed there were 20,000 people in Parliament Square.\nBut observers from anti-hate organisation Hope Not Hate said there were between 2,500 and 3,000 people on the march.\nFormer UKIP leader Gerard Batten also briefly addressed the crowd, as did Calvin Robinson, a games journalist turned online firebrand via video message.\nRobinson was sacked from GB News after supporting Fox, who was suspended after saying of political journalist Ava Evans: 'Who'd want to s*** that?'\nThe Metropolitan Police said it had identified individuals in Parliament Square who have 'a history of... violent disorder', 'football banning orders' and 'involvement in anti-lockdown protests during the pandemic and associated disorder'.\nIt said in a tweet shared at 2.14pm: 'While there have not been any offences so far, a number of people in the crowd are intoxicated. The event still has a number of hours left to go.'\nRobinson set off from Victoria around 1pm with a large group toting Union and England.\nScotland Yard said thousands of police officers had been drawn in to police the protests through the capital, with as many as 400 from forces outside London.\nBut their work has been complicated by pro-Palestine activists from Youth Demand, who vowed to block roads on Saturday. The group refused to tell the police where they intended to protest.\n'Nine Youth Demand protesters were arrested for breaching Public Order Act conditions not to leave the pavement,' the Met said.\n'The remainder of the group has largely dispersed but officers continue to monitor those still in the area.'\nAnti-racism protesters voice their opposition to Tommy Robinson's rally in Parliament Square - from an area of Whitehall separated from the square itself\nFlags wave outside of Victoria Station on Saturday as people prepare to march on the capital\nTommy Robinson pictured at the protest in London calling for the resignation of Mark Rowley\nTommy Robinson (centre), whose real name is Stephen Yaxley Lennon, leads a protest march through London to Parliament Square\nTommy Robinson speaks during a protest march at Parliament Square in London\nGroups from across the UK linked to football disorder are expected to attend the event the Metropolitan Police said\nStand Up For Racism (SUTR) and other anti-fascist groups staged a counter-protest against Tommy Robinson\nCounter protestors lined the route with signs declaring their intention to 'Stop the Far Right'\nOfficers said that they had arrested nine of protesters from activist group Youth Demand, who breached conditions not to leave the pavement.\nThe force accused them of attempting to 'cause serious disruption by blocking traffic' on York Road, close to London Waterloo station.\nMore than 2,000 police officers will be on duty on Saturday, policing the protests as well as the Champions League Final at Wembley and related fan events, the force said.\nTfL added that the Jubilee and Metropolitan lines were likely to be particularly busy as a result, forecasting possible station closures.\nSome members of the crowd set off smoke flares and air horns as they marched down Millbank.\nT/Commander Louise Puddefoot, leading the operation this weekend, said: 'Officers have been in discussion with the organisers of both protests in recent weeks.\n'Our priority is to ensure those exercising their right to lawful protest, both in the main march and as part of the counter protest, can do so safely.\n'Officers will police these demonstrations, as they always do, without fear or favour - keeping participants and the wider public safe, and responding decisively to criminal offences and any attempt to cause serious disruption.\n'While we are grateful to the main organiser of the protest for comments he has made publicly discouraging violence on Saturday, we do have concerns about the number of those believed to be attending who have links to football disorder.\n'When these groups have come together at previous protests we have regrettably seen violence directed at officers.\n'This precedent unavoidably plays a part in shaping the policing approach, including the number and nature of resources allocated to police this particular protest.'\nConditions remain in place for the procession to move along the pre-agreed route from Vauxhall Bridge Road onto Millbank, through Abingdon Square and onto Parliament Square.\n'They're not to enter the borough of Westminster, not to go onto any bridge over the Thames and not to go onto the pavement. This is to prevent the serious disruption they have said they want to achieve,' the Met wrote on Twitter/X.\nA young man sets off a red flare as he joins the far-right protest in central London\nLaurence Fox speaks during a protest march at Parliament Square, organised by Tommy Robinson\nProtesters wave St George's flags outside Parliament as they march in support of Tommy Robinson\nTommy Robinson speaks, as people attend a protest in London\nSupporters of Tommy Robinson wave Union Jack and England flags as they wait to march\nThe streets were filled with protestors joining the march decked out in Union Jacks\nTommy Robinson protest sets off from Victoria to Parliament Square\nAt the march on Saturday, Robinson's group displayed banners calling for the removal of Met Commissioner Mark Rowley from his role.\nA statement on an affiliated petition claimed to oppose biased policing practices' while 'demanding accountability from those in power'. The petition does not declare how many people have signed it.\nA third protest, 'likely smaller in size and unrelated to the above events' is also expected to take place on Saturday afternoon, organised by Youth Demand, a group protesting the ongoing conflict in Gaza.\nThey have said in public statements that they intend to occupy roads and bridges.\nT/Commander Puddefoot said: 'This group has made no secret of their intentions. They have indicated that they will go beyond what can be considered lawful protest, instead trying to cause serious disruption to communities by blocking roads and the bridges that are essential for keeping traffic moving across London.'\n'Regrettably they have not engaged with us ahead of this event,' a statement continued.\n'Protest organisers do have an obligation to inform the police of their intent to hold a protest, allowing us to plan accordingly, but Youth Demand are one of those groups who don't engage.\n'If they did we would reiterate to them that we will of course respect their right to protest, but not to cause serious disruption.\n'Officers will be deployed to respond to any action taken. They will use all the relevant powers available to them, including the imposition of conditions.'\nAnother pro-Palestine protest in the Finchley area of north London did not go ahead after 'around 10 people' turned up before going to join another protest elsewhere, the Met said.\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying\n- Glamorous Olympic skating star masterfully avoids disaster\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Leo Ross's killer unmasked: Thug who stabbed schoolboy to death named\n- Moment hi-viz thugs attack bin men in terrifying mass brawl",
