That’s positive but there’s still a lot to do.”\n“Looking back it’s gone so, so fast,” he added. “I enjoyed every minute of it when there were bumps in the road and when we had good moments and that’s about it.\n“I’m here because I’m so passionate about what I do and I love this football club and I want the best of that, so I just try to give my best version every single day.”\n“We’ve built something together and so many people have contributed in a big way to achieve that and the fact that everybody is hungry and ambitious,” he said. “But now we have to go to another level.”",
