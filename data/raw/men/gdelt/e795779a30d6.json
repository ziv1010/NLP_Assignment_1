  "body_text": "Arsenal are keeping a close watch on the contract situation of Leon Goretzka, with the midfielder emerging as a potential free-transfer target ahead of the summer window.\nAccording to Daily Mirror, the Gunners are among several clubs exploring the possibility of signing the Bayern Munich star once his current deal expires in June.\nThe north London side are understood to have made exploratory enquiries during the January transfer window, but Bayern Munich were unwilling to sanction a mid-season departure.\nWith Bayern still competing on multiple fronts and short on experienced midfield depth, the German champions were determined to keep hold of Goretzka until at least the end of the campaign.\nThat stance, however, is expected to soften once the season concludes.\nBayern Munich midfielder has experience at the top level\nNow 31, Goretzka remains one of the most experienced midfielders in European football.\nDuring his time at Bayern, he has collected an extensive trophy haul, including multiple Bundesliga titles and the Champions League, while establishing a reputation for his physical presence, intelligent movement, and goal threat from midfield.\nDespite increased competition for places in recent seasons, he has continued to deliver in big moments, particularly in high-pressure fixtures.\nUnder Mikel Arteta, the club have built a young, dynamic core, but there is a growing recognition that additional leadership and know-how could be vital as they aim to sustain title challenges and compete deep into European competition.\nArsenal face competition from other top European clubs\nArsenal are not alone in tracking Goretzka’s situation. Atlético Madrid have been long-term admirers, viewing him as a natural fit for Diego Simeone’s intense, physical midfield system.\nIn Italy, both Napoli and Juventus are believed to be monitoring developments, aware that a free transfer represents a rare chance to secure a player of Goretzka’s pedigree without a transfer fee.\nHowever, reports suggest the midfielder is keen to test himself in the Premier League before the latter stages of his career.\nThat ambition could work in Arsenal’s favour, particularly given their recent resurgence and clear sporting direction.\nSource: Man United face Arsenal competition to sign 25-year-old Rashford replacement",
