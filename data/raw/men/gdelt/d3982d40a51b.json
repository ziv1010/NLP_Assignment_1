Other European leagues, including the top leagues in France and Spain, run on similar schedules.\nA spokesperson said in a media briefing Wednesday that the WSL supports the concept of the Club World Cup, as well as efforts to grow the game worldwide, but want it to happen in the summer.\n'This is a scheduling issue rather than a strategic one. The timing is what causes us real concerns,' the spokesperson said. 'At best it will cause us real scheduling issues; at worst it is going to be catastrophic for the game in this country, our commercial program and, more importantly, the welfare of our players.'\nEuropean teams can secure up to six of 16 Club World Cup qualifying spots. Prospective entrants include Arsenal, the current Women's Champions League holders, and Chelsea, the six-time reigning WSL champion.\nThe WSL spokesperson said the group was not adequately consulted by FIFA and has the option to bar English clubs from competing.\nThe club tournament would be held between a pair of marquee international summer events -- the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil and 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.\n'There are no gaps,' the WSL spokesperson said. 'If the tournament is in a different time zone, with the rest and recovery needed, it could lead to rearrangement of a lot of fixtures.'\nOn the men's side, FIFA has organized a Club World Cup in most years since 2000. The field expanded to 32 teams for the 2025 edition held in the United States last June and July during the European offseason. It interrupted the season for Major League Soccer, which is shifting its schedule in 2027.\nFIFA chief football officer Jill Ellis defended the proposed timing of the women's tournament in speaking with media on Tuesday and said it could be reassessed four years from now.\n'We will enter a new calendar conversation in 2030,' Ellis said. 'We will look at the entire ecosystem, taking into account all shareholders. Players are a massive part of that. (January 2028) was the window that I think everybody agreed upon.'\n--Field Level Media\nShares\nShare\nTweet\nShare\nFlip\nEmail\nGet a daily dose of Middle East Star news through our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully up to date with world and business news as well.\nPublish news of your business, community or sports group, personnel appointments, major event and more by submitting a news release to Middle East Star.\nMore InformationDavos [Switzerland], January 21 (ANI): Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Wednesday said the state is fully prepared to attract...\nDavos [Switzerland], January 21 (ANI): Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar met with World Bank President Ajay Banga on the...\nDavos [Switzerland], January 21 (ANI): The State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman CS Setty on Wednesday said the lender is increasingly...\nDavos [Switzerland], January 21 (ANI): US President Donald Trump on Wednesday lauded the United States' economic performance, saying...\nSoaring prices add over $216 billion to bullion holdings since 2022, the outlet has calculated Russia has benefited from a surge...\nThe chief investment officer of AkademikerPension has cited poor US government finances and Donald Trumps push to acquire Greenland...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: The major proponent of the destruction of Gaza, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is to join U.S. President...\nBARCELONA, Spain - Two trains have been derailed near Barcelona, jafter two trains collided in southern Spain, killing 42 people. ...\nBRUSSELS, Belgium: European governments are weighing a sweeping trade response to pressure from Washington over Greenland, as tensions...\nMADRID, Spain: Calling the allegations against him of sexual misconduct absolutely untrue, Grammy-winning singer Julio Iglesias has...\nCANBERRA, ACT AUSTRALIA - Nearly 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children in Australia were removed by social media...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: U.S. aviation regulators have issued new safety warnings for airlines operating across parts of Latin America, cautioning...",
