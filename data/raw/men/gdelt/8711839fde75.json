  "body_text": "With 14 games left to go of the Premier League season, Aston Villa are still hanging on in there in terms of finishing the season in one of the Champions League places.\nAlthough they’re just a point behind Tottenham Hotspur, the other teams are starting to get away from them, with Arsenal some six points ahead of them despite being only two places above them in the table.\nUnai Emery has the added distraction of the Europa Conference League, though the Spaniard will surely want to win that trophy if he’s able.\nThat would allow the Villains a direct passage into the Europa League next season, though a Champions League berth would surely be preferred.\nOne player that they could look to sign before the end of the season, and ready for the 2024/25 campaign, is Luton Town’s Gabriel Osho.\n“Aston Villa, Fulham and Crystal Palace are believed to be among clubs monitoring the defender, whose current contract expires in the summer,” transfer expert, Dean Jones, told SportsLens.\n“Osho, 25, was loaned out to Rochdale three years ago but his climb up the football ladder since then has been sensational. He was a key part of the promotion winning team of last term and has started 13 of 14 games this campaign since returning from an early-season knee injury.\n“His presence has been pivotal as Osho has shown great ability to deal with Premier League attackers, and as such a cluster of clubs are tracking his performances closely.”\nUnder Rob Edwards, the Hatters have been playing well in their debut Premier League season, though they remain just a point above the bottom three.\nAs we go deeper into the business end of the current campaign, that’s where Edwards will earn his keep.\nIf he’s unable to keep Luton up when all is said and done, and if Osho hasn’t agreed a new deal by then either, then Villa could consider themselves in the box seat for his services.",
