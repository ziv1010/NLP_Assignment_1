The sale process is expected to be completed by the end of March 2026. Market estimates suggest the franchise could be valued at around $2 billion, reflecting the soaring commercial value of the IPL.\nSeveral bidders have been shortlisted for RCB, including investment groups led by Indian industrialists, private equity firms and overseas sports owners. Among those reported to have shown interest is a consortium linked to the Glazer family, co-owners of English Premier League club Manchester United. Non-binding bids have already been submitted, with binding offers expected in the coming weeks.\nRajasthan Royals (RR), winners of the inaugural IPL title in 2008, are also in the process of being sold. A shortlist of potential buyers has been finalised, featuring a mix of Indian and international investors, including private equity firms, entrepreneurs and media-linked groups. The franchise is expected to attract a valuation of more than $1 billion, according to market estimates.\nFinal bids for Rajasthan Royals are anticipated in early March, while the RCB transaction is expected to move into its final phase later this month. Any change in ownership will require approval from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).\nThe potential sales mark one of the most significant ownership shake-ups in IPL history and underline the league’s growing appeal as a global sports investment as preparations continue for the 2026 season.\n-\nSport5 days ago\nChampions League Elite action continues as qualification race tightens\n-\nInternational Sports4 days ago\nIPL 2026: Franchise sales gather pace as global investors circle teams\n-\nSport5 days ago\nEarly medal leaders emerge as Winter Olympics continue in Italy\n-\nLatest News5 days ago\nTerrorist activities observed along Afghanistan borders, says Lavrov\n-\nLatest News5 days ago\nPakistan president claims situation in Afghanistan is ‘similar to or worse than pre-9/11’’\n-\nSport2 days ago\nAfghanistan’s semi-final hopes hang in the balance after two T20 World Cup defeats\n-\nBusiness4 days ago\nUzbekistan approves feasibility study agreement for Trans-Afghan Railway\n-\nBusiness3 days ago\nAfghanistan signs 845MW Power deal with Azizi energy; Baradar meets company Chief to advance investment plans",
