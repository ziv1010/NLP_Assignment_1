  "body_text": "Marcus Rashford is reportedly set to report back to Manchester United for pre-season, with Aston Villa currently not making any movements to make his signing a permanent one.\nRashford joined Villa on loan for the rest of the 2024/25 season after he fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim. The two failed to see eye to eye, with Amorim later admitting that he couldn’t get Rashford to train or see football the way he did.\nThe England international enjoyed a renaissance at Villa, scoring four goals and providing an additional six assists in 17 appearances across all competitions. His progress at the Birmingham outfit was halted by a hamstring injury that effectively ended his season.\nHe has been sidelined since last month and missed Villa’s 3-0 FA Cup semi-final defeat to Crystal Palace.\nRashford’s future remains in doubt as the summer transfer window approaches. Villa can sign him permanently for £40m but they are yet to make a definitive decision on whether or not to exercise this option.\nIt has been consistently reported that Rashford’s dream move is Barcelona but the Blaugrana are hesitant to meet United’s £40m price tag. Rashford is believed to be keen on playing for a club that will be in the Champions League.\nHowever, more recently, a report covered by The Peoples Person relayed that the Carrington academy graduate may have had a change of heart and is now open to remaining at Villa and continuing to work with Unai Emery, who appears to know how to get a tune out of him.\nBut, even a permanent move to Villa may not materialise, with the BBC pointing out that Emery’s side have yet to initiate talks with United regarding a transfer.\nSimon Stone reveals that as it stands, Rashford will return to United for pre-season.\n“Marcus Rashford will return to Manchester United, at least for pre-season, as there has been no negotiations with Aston Villa regarding the possible extension of the forward’s future.”\n“The player’s camp do not believe current United head coach Ruben Amorim wants to restore the player to his squad, while minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has previously spoken about his frustration at some of the team’s highest earners not being on the pitch.”\nStone notes that very few teams will be able to sign Rashford on his current wages. He will almost certainly have to take a pay cut to remain in Europe. BBC add that another loan deal cannot be entirely ruled out.\nFeatured image Mike Hewitt via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
