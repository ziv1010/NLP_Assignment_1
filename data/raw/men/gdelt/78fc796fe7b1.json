We all have to realize that and we will. We'll make sure of that. It's a good week of preparation and then we have to be ready.\"\nChampions League shootout\nJust four points separate third-placed Manchester City from Aston Villa in seventh in the race for Champions League spots next season.\nFor the first time the Premier League's top five will all qualify for Europe's top club competition, due to strong performances in continental competition.\nLiverpool are already guaranteed a spot and Arsenal, 10 points clear of Chelsea in sixth, are practically there, leaving three places open.\nCity stole a march this week in the mini-league with a last-gasp win against Villa after Nottingham Forest, now fourth, beat Tottenham on Monday.\nVilla play Crystal Palace in the FA Cup semi-finals on Saturday, with Forest taking on City the following day at Wembley.\nIt means Newcastle, who could have Eddie Howe back on the touchline after a bout of pneumonia, would leapfrog City if they beat lowly Ipswich.\nChelsea badly need to beat Everton at home with a tough run of games to come against Liverpool, Newcastle, Manchester United and Forest.\nSouthampton playing for pride, Ipswich on brink\nSouthampton's 1-1 draw at West Ham last week meant they drew level with Derby's record-low points tally of 11 from the 2007/08 season, with five games to go to better the Rams' total.\nBut it will be of limited comfort after a miserable season for Saints, who were relegated earlier this month.\nLeicester are already down and Ipswich appear certain to follow them barring a miracle -- a draw for West Ham at Brighton on Saturday would seal their fate.\nIt would be the second successive season in which all three promoted clubs had been relegated straight back to the Championship.\nPrior to the 2023/24 campaign, this had last occurred in 1997/98.\nAll the evidence points to a worrying and widening chasm between English football's top two tiers as the season nears its end.\nFixtures\nSaturday (1400 GMT unless stated)\nChelsea v Everton (1130), Brighton v West Ham, Newcastle v Ipswich, Southampton v Fulham, Wolves v Leicester\nSunday\nBournemouth v Manchester United (1300), Liverpool v Tottenham (1530)",
