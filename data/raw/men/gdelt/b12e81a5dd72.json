  "body_text": "UEFA and futsal: a timeline\nSunday, October 5, 2025\nArticle summary\nWe study the development of the five-a-side game in Europe across three decades of exciting growth.\nArticle top media content\nArticle body\nUEFA has been organsing futsal tournaments for nearly 30 years, with the original men's national-team Futsal EURO now joined by club, youth and women's competitions.\nFutsal's origins can be traced back to 1930, when it was invented by Uruguayan teacher Juan Carlos Ceriani in response to the continual flooding of outdoor pitches during the country's rainy season, which prevented his pupils from playing football for long periods.\nFar from being a simple derivative of football played indoors, futsal was devised as a whole new sport, taking inspiration from basketball (the number of players), handball (the pitch), water polo (the role of the referee) and, of course, football.\nThe game soon spread across South America but Europe was more resistant – a version of indoor mini-football became popular in the Soviet Union in the 1950s but it wasn’t until the 1970s that futsal reached western Europe, South American immigrants bringing it with them to Portugal and Spain.\nIn 1974, the UEFA Executive Committee established a Committee for Indoor and Women’s Football in a bid to standardise the sport, which was being played in two different formats – both five-a-side and eight-a-side – on pitches of differing sizes, with various different types of ball, and with differing rules as to whether the ball could be played against the side panels or not. UEFA’s efforts had no immediate impact and the committee was disbanded in 1978 – a sport for which national competitions were organised in only five European countries was simply not a priority.\nIn 1989, FIFA organised its first Futsal World Championship (later renamed the FIFA Futsal World Cup) in the Netherlands (runners-up behind Brazil), with UEFA assuming responsibility for the European qualifying competition for the 1992 edition. Two mini-tournaments, featuring five teams each, took place in Spain and Italy.\nBy 1993, only 13 of UEFA's member associations organised national futsal championships, but at the instigation of Executive Committee member Ángel María Villar Llona, president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation, a questionnaire was sent to all associations to establish a picture of the state of futsal in Europe.\nIn the autumn of 1995, UEFA organised European qualifying for the 1996 Futsal World Championship, as well as an invitational tournament in Cordoba, Spain for the continent's top teams. This was to be the genesis of today's modern UEFA Futsal EURO, and where we pick up the timeline of events that leads us to the present day.",
