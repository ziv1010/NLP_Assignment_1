He praised the businessman's role in community and humanitarian projects, including efforts towards providing housing for lower-income families and setting up health centres.\n“Our heartfelt condolences to the family of the late businessman Hussain Khansaheb, one of the most important entrepreneurs in the Emirates,” Sheikh Mohammed said on X.\nAs recognition for his service through the decades, Mr Khansaheb received numerous awards. In 2021, President Sheikh Mohamed personally presented him with an Abu Dhabi Award, under an initiative that recognises those who have dedicated themselves to supporting others and creating a better UAE.\nSheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed, First Deputy Ruler of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of the UAE also paid tribute to Mr Khansaheb saying he leaves an enduring legacy.\n“Our deepest condolences and sympathies to his family and loved ones,” he posted on X.\nDr Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to President Sheikh Mohamed, also extended “heartfelt condolences and sympathy” to Mr Khansaheb's family.\nMr Khansaheb played a “significant role” in the growth of the UAE and was part of a group of pioneers who built the country up, Dr Gargash said.\nThe company, in a statement on its website, said it was a moment of \"deep sadness for us all as we reflect on the extraordinary life of a man who was dedicated to guiding Khansaheb Group and to building a better future for the UAE\".\n\"On behalf of Khansaheb Group, we extend our heartfelt condolences to his family.\"\nKhansaheb was formed in the 1930s – decades before the UAE was formed – and it became involved in crucial early infrastructure projects.\nHussain Khansaheb took over as group chairman in 1954, after assuming the business from his uncle – the company's founder Khansaheb Hussain Bin Hassan Amad who had worked for the British administration.\nThe company lists the Maqta causeway in Abu Dhabi (the first crossing between Abu Dhabi island and the mainland), the roundabout around Dubai's Clock Tower, Mall of the Emirates and luxury hotel retreat Bab Al Shams as some of the projects it has worked on.\nIt was also involved with Sharjah International Airport, Fujairah City Centre – the emirate's first large mall – and the Expo site.\nThe contracting group, with thousands of employees, has also been associated with countless others projects across the country such as hotels, offices, roads, schools and sports centres.\nIn 2017, Amer Khansaheb, managing director of Khansaheb Investments, spoke about how the business started as a trading company and provided support and maintenance to oil companies in the desert.\n“It was my grandfather, Hussain Abdulrahman Khansaheb, in the 1950s who grew the company under more of a specialisation in construction.”\nToday Dubai is a global metropolis and the UAE a modern country. And it was pioneering businesspeople such as Mr Khansaheb who helped transform it.",
