There might be a chance he could move to a different club in Saudi Arabia, with the odds at 5/1. A move back to Real Madrid is priced at 10/1.\nRonaldo became a worldwide famous player during his first time at Manchester United, winning three Premier League titles and the Champions League while playing at Old Trafford after joining under Sir Alex Ferguson.\nAt Real Madrid, Ronaldo became one of the best players ever, scoring an amazing 450 goals in 438 games for the team.",
