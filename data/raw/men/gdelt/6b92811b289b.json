They were intent on catching us cold and putting us under pressure.\nHowever, Everton are not Aston Villa, Everton don’t have an Ollie Watkins, and Sean Dyche is no Unai Emery. Newcastle soaked up the early pressure, imposed themselves on proceedings, and were utterly dominant by full time.\n4-1 was about right, and needless to say, the “best fans in the world” had left the ground long before the final whistle.\nI have no idea why they think a new stadium is a good idea. I wouldn’t pay to watch them.\nIf the Spurs win cracked open the door of Champions League football, then this forced it ajar, especially given the draw between Spurs and manure.\nIf we do the same to Southampton at the weekend, we’ll have kicked that door off its hinges.\nNick Pope – 7\nHe’ll be gutted that an Everton corner managed to find its way into the net, but other than that, I only remember him having to make one save.\nFor most of the time, he just needed to manage crosses and the occasional scuffer.\nKieran Trippier – 8\nIt seems daft to say that a right back ran a game, but to a large extent, Trippier did.\nComfortable in attack and defence and as tough as teak.\nHad a calming effect on those around him when Everton were playing frantically and an inspiring effect once we’d weathered the early storm.\nFabian Schar – 8\nA great display.\nEverton got very little change out of him, we saw his trademark crossfield ball a few times, and he had an excellent goal disallowed for Dan Burn’s offside.\nSven Botman – 8\nWhen I played football, my coaches used to say good defenders are good because they WANT to defend.\nPoor defenders wish they were playing centre forward.\nWell, Botman loves defending and he is very good at it.\nIf he carries on developing, he’ll be one of the best in the world in a couple of seasons.\nMatt Targett – 6\nHis first start for months, so off the pace.\nHe certainly wasn’t going to win a foot race against Iwobi but he did OK.\nSean Longstaff – 8\nLongstaff is a neat player rather than a spectacular one and I absolutely do NOT mean that as a negative.\nHe was all over the park, breaking up play, laying the ball off, and protecting the defence.\nCould / should have won a penalty in an incident where he sustained a game-ending ankle injury.\nBruno Guimaraes – 10\nMy mate, who is a very good footballer – and a mackem – says he loves Bruno because he never gives the ball away.\nI couldn’t put it better myself.\nDoucoure and Onana played well for Everton but Bruno was the best player on the pitch.\nJoe Willock – 8\nI thought he was poor in the first half but improved throughout the game.\nNearly scored a worldie and got a great assist for Joelinton’s goal\nMiguel Almiron – 6\nWorked hard – he always does – but gave the ball away too often for my liking\nCallum Wilson – 9\nI was surprised to see him start ahead of Isak, but he got his customary goal against Everton, and then another.\nThe second one was world class. He led the line well when the game was a war of attrition\nJoelinton – 9\nA goal and assist for the big man today but what I liked about his display, was his battling quality.\nEverton wanted a fight and he made them wish they hadn’t. He really is a player.\nBT gave him Player of the Match. If it wasn’t for Bruno, I’d agree with them.\nSUBS:\nDan Burn – 6 Benched because of illness, apparently, but fitted in seamlessly when subbed on for Targett.\nHe’ll be feeling a lot better after this result\nJacob Murphy – 7\nI’m so chuffed for Murphy.\nTwo goals v Spurs and another tonight. He loves this club and the fans are starting to love him\nAlexander Isak – 8\nIsak is filth.\nFaster than he looks, tougher than he looks, and with skill to burn.\nHis assist for Murphy’s goal had me (and the Newcastle players) laughing out loud.\nElliot Anderson – 5\nOn for the last three minutes.\nThe boy can play but it’s hard for anyone to get into this team right now. His day will some.\nAnthony Gordon – 6\nBy the time he came on, the Everton fans hardly had the strength to boo him.\nWas enthusiastic but too little time to impose himself.\nStats from BBC Sport:\nEverton 1 Newcastle 4 – Thursday 27 April 2pm\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nWilson 28, 75 Joelinton 72, Murphy 81\nEverton:\nMcNeil 80\n(In brackets the half-time stats)\nPossession was Everton 40% Newcastle 60%\nTotal shots were Everton 13 Newcastle 15\nShots on target were Everton 5 Newcastle 9\nCorners were Everton 3 Newcastle 14\nReferee: Andre Marriner\nNewcastle United:\nPope, Trippier, Schar, Botman, Targett (Burn 68), Bruno, Joelinton, Almiron (Murphy 68), Willock (Anderson 87), Longstaff (Isak 74), Wilson (Gordon 87)\nUnused Subs:\nDubravka, Ritchie, Lascelles, Manquillo\n(Everton 1 Newcastle 4 – The instant NUFC fan / writer reaction – Read HERE)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
