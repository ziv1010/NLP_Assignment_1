  "body_text": "Bayern Munich coach Thomas Tuchel has opened up on the rumours linking him with a move back to the Premier League and Manchester United.\nThe Red Devils have had a tumultuous season where they have suffered from an array of on-field and off-field problems.\nA mounting injury crisis could be viewed as misfortune, but when there have been so many cases of repeated problems being picked up in training, it is natural that the finger of blame be pointed at Erik ten Hag and his coaching staff.\nOne problem that is undeniably the manager’s fault is the strange decision to make a drastic tactical switch in the summer and convert the team into a transition-based side which searches for chaos in matches.\nWith United sitting eighth in the Premier League table and with 55 goals conceded and a record 13 losses, few would argue it has worked out.\nTherefore, many in the press have speculated that Ten Hag will be sacked after the FA Cup final in a few weeks time.\nThere have been a range of managers linked with the potentially vacant hotseat but one name that just won’t go away is that of current Bayern Munich coach, Thomas Tuchel.\nIt has been previously reported that he would be keen to join Manchester United when he leaves Munich at the end of the season and that he would have even been prepared to reject the bright lights of the Camp Nou, before it was announced that Xavi would stay at Barcelona.\nThere have also been reports that the current playing squad at Old Trafford would love to play for the Champions League winning coach.\nSpeaking to TNT Sports ahead of his side’s crucial Champions League semi-final second leg against Real Madrid, Tuchel discussed where his future may lie.\n“It’s very, very, very unlikely that it’s at Bayern, I have to say, because we have an agreement, there is at the moment no reason to doubt this agreement. We took this position, the initiative came from the club, and so it is and I’m fine with it.”\nWhen asked about rumours linking him back to England, the 50-year-old revealed his strong feelings for English football and the Premier League.\n“I’d rather not answer but it is no secret that I loved it at Chelsea, I loved it in England and I loved it in the Premier League for sure, it was a very, very special time and I remember it very well.”\nThese comments will only add fuel to the fire that the German wants to succeed Ten Hag and take over the reins at Old Trafford in the likely event INEOS pull the plug on the Dutchman’s reign.\nWant to be the first to hear breaking Man United news?
