  "body_text": "Erik ten Hag admitted he does not know whether he will still be Manchester United manager next season even as he celebrated a famous FA Cup final win against Manchester City on Saturday.\nTeenage stars Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo struck in the first half at Wembley and United then dug deep to win 2-1 after City substitute Jeremy Doku’s late effort.\nIt means Ten Hag’s side finished a miserable season on a high and also qualified for next season’s Europa League.\nThe build-up to the second successive all-Manchester FA Cup final was dominated by talk over Ten Hag’s future after a report on Friday said the Dutchman would be sacked regardless of the outcome at Wembley.\nUnited finished eighth in the Premier League — their lowest placing since 1990 — and crashed out of the Champions League at the group stage.\nTen Hag admitted that he still did not know what the future would hold for him.\n“I don’t know (if I will stay),” he told the BBC as he celebrated United’s win in the London sunshine.\n“The only thing I am doing is preparing my team, develop my team, progress my team and individual players. This is for me a project.\n“When I came in things were a mess. We are now better but by far not where we want to be.\n“Football is about winning trophies. I want to play the best football, I want to play dynamic football, but in the end you have to win trophies. I am very proud of the players and staff because they did an incredible job.”\nUnited captain Bruno Fernandes said: “It is crucial for everyone. We know the manager is under so much scrutiny, he deserves this.\n“Also everyone in the backroom staff and the players, we all deserve this.”\nAFP",
