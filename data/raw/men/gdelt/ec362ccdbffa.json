But you have to build something here and we’ll have a look at him in due course.”\nAs well as players, Lambert has also had to familiarise himself with the staff already at the club in the month that he has been at Town.\nAsked what he has made to them, he joked: “I think my own staff, the lads I’ve brought with me, I think they’re really poor! No, they’ve been brilliant, Stuart [Taylor, his assistant manager], the two Jims [goalkeeping-coach Jimmy Walker and fitness coach Jim Henry] and Gilly [first-team coach Matt Gill] have been brilliant.\n“We didn’t know anybody when we came in the door, so it's an open vision you’ve got for it. What I think the club has probably lacked is everybody trying to play the same way.\n“We’ve tried to implement that with Chris [Hogg] and Nashy [Gerard Nash, the U23s coaches] and filtered down [to younger academy teams] with Bryan.\n\"You want everybody to try and play the same way throughout the club so it’s just an easier transition to get into the first team so that when kids do come up they know the moves that I want to do.\n“And I’ve got to say, they’ve all been trying it. We’ll have a coaches’ meeting in a few weeks and we’ll show the coaches what we expect at the different age levels.\n“I think that’s got to be structured and that’s what I want to do. It takes time but we have to start somewhere, it’s like throwing a seed in the grass, you have to let it grow.”\nHe says his time playing in Germany with Borussia Dortmund, with whom he won a Champions League winners medal in 1997, has had an impact on his management.\n“Playing over there was great, I played with an unbelievable football club,” he reflected. “You can talk about world class players being flippant, but I really played with world class players, they were brilliant.\n“I played under a great manager [Ottmar Hitzfeld] with great support behind it, everything about it was incredible. I played against great sides, great Bayern Munich teams, Schalke, I could go through them all.\n“I also did my pro licence over there which was a great learning curve. I enjoyed my time over there and it’s well documented that I go over there and pick up different things, different ideas from different managers. That’s a big part of how a try and run a football club.”\nMore and more British players, youngsters in particular, are moving to the Bundesliga and he says it can be a good move for them.\n“I think if you get the right football club,” he added. “I think going abroad, it’s a great experience, it’s an eye-opener.\n“I was fortunate, I played for a great, great club. You’ve got to get the right club and first and foremost you have to learn the language, you have to get that language sorted right away from day one if you can.\n“It’s a difficult language to learn German, but once you get the basis of it and if you’re at the right club it’s a fantastic country to play in.”\nPhoto: TWTD\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nThe more we see & the more we hear the more we can and do believe in Paul Lambert and his team .\nThank goodness !\nCOYB\n“We've tried to implement that with Chris [Hogg] and Nashy [Gerard Nash, the U23s coaches] and filtered down [to younger academy teams] with Bryan.\n\"You want everybody to try and play the same way throughout the club so it's just an easier transition to get into the first team so that when kids do come up they know the moves that I want to do.\nJust a shame neither Mick or Hurst tried to get the senior teams to play the same style as the U-23s downwards as they are the ones who seem to know how to get the ball down and play!\nHe had minimal interest in our academy players. Shipping them out of the Club as soon as he could, and was hardly all encompassing with other established staff here. Yet in his interview he states that things need to change at the Club, or we will never be successful again.\nCan't wait for Lambert to ram that one down his throat.\nHe clearly has a strategy and I hope that he is given plenty of time to implement it, regardless of what division we are in next year. A few good additions in January and hopefully we can survive in the meantime and rebuild in the summer. Just need 3 points Wednesday night to get things going.....\nOh and 3 points tonight would be a great start!!\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
