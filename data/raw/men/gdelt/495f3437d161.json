He could make his debut on Saturday against Lens.\nKey stats\n150 - Monaco striker Wissam Ben Yedder's next goal will be his 150th in Ligue 1. Kylian Mbappe (167) is the only other player to have reached that landmark in the 21st century.\n21 - The number of goals scored in Ligue 1 last season by Folarin Balogun on loan at Reims.\n13 - Mbappe has scored 13 goals in his last 10 Ligue 1 appearances stretching back to April.\nFixtures (kick-offs GMT)\nFriday\nNantes v Marseille (1900)\nSaturday\nBrest v Rennes (1500), Monaco v Lens (1900)\nSunday\nToulouse v Clermont (1100), Le Havre v Lorient, Lille v Montpellier, Metz v Reims (all 1300), Nice v Strasbourg (1505), Lyon v Paris Saint-Germain (1845)\n© 2023 AFP",
