  "body_text": "The Champions League has just one round of fixtures left to play in the new league phase, and there’s plenty still to play for.\nLiverpool have breezed through their first seven games, while Arsenal are all but confirmed to reach the last 16.\nManchester City, however, are remarkably still outside the top 24. Anything other than a win against Belgian side Club Brugge will see the 2023 winners eliminated.\nAnd Aston Villa, despite a strong start in this season’s revamped competition, have suffered recent setbacks that have left them outside the top eight and needing a win against Celtic to secure automatic qualification to the knockout stages.\nIt’s finely poised, with all 36 teams in action on Wednesday evening.\nWe’ve teamed up with bet365, the first official sports betting partner of the UEFA Champions League, to bring you the latest odds ahead of a major night of football action.\nBet £10 on this week’s UEFA Champions League action and Get £50 in Free Bets – Ts&Cs Apply\nAston Villa v Celtic\nVilla need to win to have any chance of getting into the top eight and clinch an automatic qualification place.\nThey’ll also be relying on Italian outfit Atalanta either losing or drawing to Barcelona at the Nou Camp, as well as hoping that Monaco, Feyenoord, Lille or Brest don't win by a big margin and overhaul them on goal difference.\nThe good news is that the Midlanders have won two of their past three Champions League matches at Villa Park. Celtic have failed to gain a single victories from three away games.\nFull-time result:\nResult/both teams to score:\n- To Win from Behind: Aston Villa 11/2 / Celtic 16/1\n- To Win to Nil: Aston Villa 7/4 / Celtic 10/1\n- To Win Either Half: Aston Villa 3/10 / Celtic 7/4\n- To Win Both Halves: Aston Villa 11/4 / Celtic 20/1\n- To Score in Both Halves: Aston Villa 6/5 / Celtic 9/2\nTo score anytime:\nGirona v Arsenal\nThe Gunners are in third place with 16 points, behind Liverpool and Barcelona.\nOnly a loss to Girona and huge wins for Atalanta, Bayer Leverkusen, Monaco, Feyenoord, Lille and Brest – enough to overturn a significant goal difference – would push Arsenal out of the top eight.\nThe Catalan side have struggled in their debut Champions League campaign, with just three points from seven matches leaving them in 31st place and unable to qualify for the knockout stages. They’ve also conceded 11 goals.\nHowever, Mikel Arteta’s side have suffered a draw and a loss away from home in this season’s competition.\nFull-time result:\nResult/both teams to score:\n- To Win from Behind: Girona 18/1 / Arsenal 6/1\n- To Win to Nil: Girona 9/1 / Arsenal 7/4\n- To Win Either Half: Girona 7/4 / Arsenal 1/3\n- To Win Both Halves: Girona 20/1 / Arsenal 3/1\n- To Score in Both Halves: Girona 5/1 / Arsenal 6/4\nTo score anytime:\nMan City v Club Brugge\nMan City are currently 25th in the table, and can't finish inside the top eight. If they fail to beat Club Brugge, Pep Guardiola’s side will be out.\nCity have won only one of their past three Champions League matches at Etihad Stadium, while Club Brugge's away record stands at one victory from three games. Their last outing was a home draw with Italian giants Juventus.\nErling Haaland has scored in five of Manchester City’s previous eight home matches in the Champions League, netting eight goals in total.\nFull-time result:\nResult/both teams to score:\n- To Win from Behind: Man City 5/1 / Club Brugge 28/1\n- To Win to Nil: Man City 1/1 / Club Brugge 22/1\n- To Win Either Half: Man City 1/10 / Club Brugge 9/2\n- To Win Both Halves: Man City 6/5 / Club Brugge 50/1\n- To Score in Both Halves: Man City 8/13 / Club Brugge 9/1\nPSV v Liverpool\nPSV are sitting 19th in the Champions League table, clinging on to qualification with 11 points. They’ve won three, drawn two and lost two of their fixtures in this season’s competition.\nMeanwhile, table toppers Liverpool have a maximum 21 points, with 15 goals scored and just two conceded.\nPSV have scored eight goals across their three home fixtures in the Champions League, and if Arne Slot decides to shuffle his team now that automatic qualification is guaranteed, the Eredivisie leaders have every chance of causing an upset.\nFull-time result:\nResult/both teams to score:\n- To Win from Behind: PSV 9/1 / Liverpool 7/1\n- To Win to Nil: PSV 6/1 / Liverpool 4/1\n- To Win Either Half: PSV 5/6 / Liverpool 8/13\n- To Win Both Halves: PSV 9/1 / Liverpool 6/1\n- To Score in Both Halves: PSV 9/4 / Liverpool 13/8\nTo score anytime:\nBet £10 on this week’s UEFA Champions League action and Get £50 in Free Bets – Ts&Cs Apply\nSignificant Open Account Offer Ts&Cs\n- Available to new customers only.
