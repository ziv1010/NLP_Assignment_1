We didn't do the basics right,\" said Howe.\n\"Sometimes away from home you have those spells in the game and you have to weather the storm. Unfortunately we didn't do that and we conceded some bad goals.\"\nHowe was forced into handing goalkeeper Loris Karius just his second appearance since joining Newcastle in 2022.\nKarius was unfortunate for the opening goal as he parried Gabriel Magalhaes' powerful header, but the ball ricocheted back off Botman and crept over the line.\nArsenal have now scored 19 times from set-pieces in the Premier League this season.\nIf there was a hint of fortune about the opener, the hosts' second was a thing of beauty.\nJorginho's ball over the top picked out the run of Gabriel Martinelli, who turned the ball perfectly into the path of Havertz for his eighth goal of the season.\nSaka has now scored seven times in the last five Premier League games and only a fine save from Karius at his near post delayed the England international continuing his scoring streak before half-time.\nHavertz should have sealed the three points within two minutes of the second half when he dragged a shot wide after Martinelli's pass played him clean through on goal.\nBut the German international was involved for the third goal as from his pass, Saka jinked inside and fired into the far corner for his 16th goal of the season.\nSet-piece coach Nicolas Jover has been credited with Arsenal's lethal threat from dead balls.\nThe Frenchman had more cause to celebrate 21 minutes from time when Kiwior's header from Declan Rice's corner deflected in off Lewis Miley.\nNewcastle did at least muster a consolation five minutes from time when former Arsenal midfielder Joe Willock looped in a header off the post.\nBut that did little to spoil Arsenal's Saturday night party as they made another statement to Liverpool and City that they will not crumble under the pressure of a title race like they did 12 months ago.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
