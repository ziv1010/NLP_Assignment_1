Even when Kylian Mbappe saw a late equaliser ruled out by a marginal VAR offside call, they barely missed a beat.\nIt felt like it was building towards something — if not an equalising goal, then perhaps they would turn on their players at the final whistle. The fans’ patience wears thin at the best of times, let alone after Bayern Munich inflicted PSG’s third consecutive defeat, one which leaves the French club’s Champions League hopes hanging by a thread once more.\nAdvertisement\nPerhaps the players sensed it too. Lionel Messi’s and Neymar’s relationship with the ultras has been strained ever since the criticism got far too personal when PSG crashed out of last season’s Champions League in the quarter-finals. The pair of them looked apprehensive as, for once, they joined their team-mates behind the goal at the Virage Auteuil, braced for the seemingly inevitable backlash.\nIt didn’t come.\nInstead, the ultras kept applauding, chanting “Paris”, waving their flags and holding their banners in defiance.\nRather than anger, they chose unity and solidarity, as if to remind the players that this Champions League campaign is still alive as they head to Munich for the second leg in three weeks. It is only 1-0 at half-time, after all.\nUnless PSG can get their act together, though, the anger will come, because they have now suffered more defeats (five) in the first 11 matches of 2023 than they did in the whole of 2022 (four). Add to that, the entire PSG project seems less convincing and less credible than at any time since Qatar Sports Investments bought the club in the summer of 2011.\nAs far back as 2014, PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi declared that the club “have to win” the Champions League within four years. Nine years on from those words being spoken, despite the fortunes invested, that target now seems to drifting out of reach once again and the whole project seems more and more underwhelming.\nSome might say Qatar’s PSG project is failing. But it isn’t. Because for one thing, the club are enjoying a golden era, dominant in France and established as one of the biggest and most attractive brands in world football. And because — shock horror — the project has never been about football anyway.\nThe Emir of Qatar was at the Parc des Princes last night to see this supposed showpiece fixture, but only because he was in Paris to meet France’s president Emmanuel Macron to discuss a strengthening of relations between the two countries as well as energy and imports of liquefied natural gas.\nAdvertisement\nYes, the Qataris would dearly love PSG to win the Champions League, but the football club is just one of numerous soft-power acquisitions that have strengthened their diplomatic position in Europe. They don’t “have to win” it.\nPurely as a sporting project, though, the expectations and pressure on PSG are obvious, given the wealth and the talent at their disposal.\nSome of the criticism they have had over the past decade has been harsh. There have been times — under Carlo Ancelotti, Laurent Blanc, Unai Emery, Thomas Tuchel and perhaps more briefly under Mauricio Pochettino — when they have looked capable of winning a Champions League, only to fall short by small margins or crack when the pressure has been most intense.\nYes, they have capitulated, from a position of strength, at the hands of Barcelona, Manchester United, Manchester City and Real Madrid, but that has been the story of the Champions League more broadly over the past few years: knockout ties turning dramatically and one team or another collapsing in a matter of minutes. It has happened to PSG a few times, but it has also happened to Barcelona, Madrid, Liverpool, City and others.\nLast night against Bayern was nothing of the sort, though. The problem here, apart from coming up against a better team, was that PSG were so insipid for much of the game. They didn’t get going at all until the closing stages, once Mbappe, on his way back from a thigh injury, had come off the bench just before the hour.\nThere have been times when PSG players have suggested it is hard to meet the required standard in the Champions League when their clear superiority in Ligue 1 means they are unused to the pressure that comes in those high-stakes games against Europe’s best.\nThat’s easy to say when you are winning the league with 90-plus points and 100-plus goals, as they did in 2016, 2018 and 2019, but not when you have lost to Lens, Rennes, Marseille (in the French Cup) and Monaco in your 10 outings this calendar year before being outplayed on your own pitch by Bayern.\nAdvertisement\nIt all just looks so flat, so empty, so superficial. So much star quality, yet so little spirit, so little cohesion.\nBayern had more of the ball (54 per cent possession — and it felt like more) and worked harder without it, too.\nAccording to UEFA’s post-match statistics, Bayern’s players covered a total of 118.3 km to 110.4 km combined by their hosts.\nWhen this was put to PSG coach Christophe Galtier in his press conference, he said, “I can’t change the profile of the players. Neymar and Leo (Messi) are players who receive the ball to their feet. That’s their characteristic.”\nPochettino encountered similar frustrations when it came to trying to create the right chemistry between Messi, Neymar and Mbappe. “Everyone knows that when those three are together, amazing, unbelievable things can happen on the pitch,” the former Tottenham Hotspur and PSG coach said last year in his World Cup column for The Athletic. “But of course, it’s not easy to find the right balance.”\nGO DEEPER\nPochettino: This Argentina know that when you have Messi, you need to run for him\nIn search of the right balance, Galtier picked Warren Zaire-Emery, who at 16 years and 343 days became the youngest player ever to start a game in the Champions League’s knockout phase. Zaire-Emery was born on March 8, 2006 — two months before Messi won the first of his four Champions League titles with Barcelona. Or, to put it another way, he had just turned five years old when PSG were bought by QSI and was 11 when they signed Mbappe.\nIt was no fault of Zaire-Emery’s that, initially positioned on the right of midfield, he made little headway before he and Carlos Soler made way for Mbappe and Fabian Ruiz on 57 minutes. The frustration for Galtier was that, having prepared both players to come on with the game still goalless, he was unable to make the substitution before Kingsley Coman gave Bayern a 53rd-minute lead.\nAdvertisement\nIt seemed apt, though, that Coman scored the only goal of the game, just as he did when these two clubs met in that pandemic-delayed Champions League final in Lisbon in 2020.\nComan grew up in Moissy-Cramayel, on the south-eastern outskirts of Paris, and began his career at PSG only to leave for Juventus as a 17-year-old in 2014, sensing his first-team opportunities would be limited, and then join Bayern a year later.\nNow 26, Coman started this game at left wing-back, then switched to the right flank after Alphonso Davies came on for newly-arrived Manchester City loanee Joao Cancelo at half-time.\nIt was intriguing to hear Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann’s explanation for the change.\n“Joao didn’t have that many deep runs behind the (PSG) defensive line,” Nagelsmann said. “We knew there would be more chances in the second half for more deep runs from our wingers, like you saw with the goal. We analysed this before the game and also at half-time.”\nThe goal did indeed come from one wing-back, Davies, picking out the other, Coman. It was a terrible goal for PSG to concede — whether in relation to the lack of pressure on Davies when he crossed, the space afforded to Coman as he lined up his shot or the failure of Gianluigi Donnarumma to stop the ball when it came his way — but Coman and indeed Nagelsmann were entitled to be delighted.\nBayern could have extended their lead after that, with Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Matthijs de Ligt forcing Donnarumma into fine saves, but PSG improved with the introduction of Mbappe, who had missed their previous three matches through injury.\nSuddenly, they had a player who might ask questions of Bayern’s three central defenders, Benjamin Pavard, Dayot Upamecano and De Ligt, who had all looked entirely comfortable to that point.\nOn 83 minutes, Mbappe thought he had equalised, attacking the near post to score from a Nuno Mendes cut-back, only to find that his provider had been fractionally offside in the build-up.\nAdvertisement\nThere was a minor onslaught from PSG after that, with Messi seeing a shot deflected off target and Vitinha having a stinging effort well saved by the injured Manuel Neuer’s replacement Yann Sommer. But the visitors held on to claim a well-deserved victory despite seeing Pavard sent off in added time for a second bookable offence.\nBayern are still taking shape in Nagelsmann’s second year — they were disappointing in the way they fell to Villarreal in the Champions League quarter-finals last March and there was a period earlier this season when they won just one out of six matches in the Bundesliga — but they are a team with an identity and a recognisable playing style. Under Nagelsmann, they are evolving; whether that’s into champions of Europe come the final on June 10, it is too early to say.\nPSG are a different matter. They look so underwhelming — a group of individuals thrown together with little consideration to tactical considerations, let alone dressing-room dynamics.\nCan it really be possible to advance so far in such a short time, with all that Qatari money behind them and so many great players in their ranks, and yet end up playing as poorly as this?\nWell, yes, because the PSG project has lost its way a little — with too much emphasis on star players and not enough attention paid to the technical and psychological make-up of the squad.\nTheir ultras said as much this time last year, saying they “no longer recognise (…) a club that piles up the stars like a spoiled child, without concern for sporting consistency. The face of a club that dreams so much bigger that it feels like the season starts in February”.\nIf that is so, the whole campaign building up to the Champions League knockout stage, then what a dreadful anticlimax last night was. PSG’s players and supporters can only hope there is a spectacular twist to this tale when the teams meet again in Munich on March 8.\nIf not, the fallout might be ugly.\n(Top photo: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP via Getty Images)",
