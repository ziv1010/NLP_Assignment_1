A defender’s goal in the 64th minute doubled the lead before Joel Jones gave Arnett Gardens FC hope in the 76 th minute when he beat the Trinidad and Tobago national goalkeeper Marvin Phillips with a bomb from about 30 yards out to make the scores 2-1.\nAC Port of Spain, however, restored their two goals lead two minutes later when Arnett Gardens FC’s goalkeeper Roje Williams allowed a cross from the right hand side to go through his legs and Henry tapped in from two yards out.\nThe final nail in the Arnett Gardens Football Club’s coffin came in time added when Williams was caught just outside his 18-yard box and the ball was played over his head and substitute Michael Chaves scored into an open goal.\n-Paul A Reid",
