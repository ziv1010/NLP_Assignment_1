There were a lot of conversations between his representatives and ours, our representatives and him, between him and me,” said Slot at his 9am press conference.\n“I think we decided as a club – and I was part of that decision – not to take him to Inter Milan and I am always in contact with them, but when it comes to the decision-making of the line-up or the squad, they always leave it open to me.\n“That is not to say I don’t talk to them, mainly Richard not Michael (Edwards, chief executive of football for owners Fenway Sports Group), but I talk to him about so many things. The decision to play a player or have him in the squad – as I have experienced until now and I think this will never change – is entirely up to me.”\nIn Salah’s absence a depleted team beat Inter Milan 1-0 in a solid away performance which made it two wins and two draws in the last four matches, all with the Egyptian not in the starting line-up.\nTuesday night saw the Dutchman employ a diamond midfield formation which allowed him to start £200million worth of striking talent in Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike for only the second time.\nWhile it could hardly be considered a roaring success, Slot is hopeful of giving them more chances.\n“The more they play together, they more they will adapt to each other and the better they will co-operate,” he added.\n“I saw promising things from the both of them. It’s only the second time they’ve played together. We will see more of them playing together in the future.\n“Alex got a knock in the first half, so let’s see how he recovers from that today and if he is able to start tomorrow.”\nFellow forward Federico Chiesa has recovered from illness and will rejoin the squad.",
