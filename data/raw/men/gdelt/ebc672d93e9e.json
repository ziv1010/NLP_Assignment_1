There are no guarantees in sport, and change can inevitably take time but we are in it for the long term and together we want to help take Manchester United back to where the club belongs, at the very top of English, European and world football.\n\"I take that responsibility very seriously.\"\nRatcliffe added he would not be speaking about club matters until the deal had received regulatory approval.\nBut it appears a saga that began 13 months ago, when the unpopular Glazers said they were considering \"strategic alternatives\", is now nearing an end.\nRatcliffe, who tried to buy Chelsea last year, grew up in the Manchester region and describes himself as a committed fan.\nHis group has extensive involvement in sport, owning French Ligue 1 club Nice and Swiss side Lausanne-Sport, as well as the INEOS Grenadiers cycling team.\nThe Glazers bought the club for £790 million ($1.47 billion at the time) in 2005, loading the 20-time English champions with debt.\nSheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani and Ratcliffe made offers in the region of £5 billion for a complete takeover, but that fell short of the Glazer family's valuation and the Qatari banker withdrew his bid for a 100 percent purchase of the club in October.\nUnited have not been crowned Premier League champions since Alex Ferguson's final season in charge in 2013 and have already been knocked out of this term's League Cup and the Champions League.\n© 2023 AFP",
