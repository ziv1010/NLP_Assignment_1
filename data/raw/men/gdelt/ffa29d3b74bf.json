The Sky Blues even had the ball in the back of United's net for a fourth time as extra-time drew to close, only for VAR to disallow Victor Torp's effort for the tightest of offsides.\nUnited eventually prevailed on penalties, but the majority of their players celebrated in a subdued manner and instead congratulated Coventry for their valiant efforts.\nMuch of the post-game discourse has been about United's calamitous showing in the final 20 minutes of the game, and Ten Hag was clearly fuming about how his side have been portrayed in the media when he spoke in his latest press conference.\n\"No. Absolutely not,\" Ten Hag replied when asked if he could understand the reaction.\n\"You asked the question: 'is it embarrassing?' No, the reaction from you was embarrassing. It is the comments. Top football is about results, we made it to a final and we deserved it not only by this game but also the other games.\n\"We lost control for 20 minutes, we also had bad luck, 3-2, 3-3. We were very lucky in the end, it is clear. Penalties was very good and we made it to the final, it is a huge achievement. Twice, in two years, is magnificent. For me as a manager, four cup finals in four years.\n\"The comments are a disgrace.\"\nTen Hag went on to acknowledge that Antony, who has been criticised for intentionally goading Coventry's players, had reacted to winning in an inappropriate manner, but was quick to point to the example set by former Manchester United captain Harry Maguire.\n\"He [Antony] was [provoked] and should not react like this. You have not seen the provocation, only the reaction, but he should not do it.\n\"I've also seen Harry Maguire. We should acknowledge the performance of Coventry, coming back at 70 minutes when we dominated the game. The game must be closed, but the return from their side was very good.\"\nSpeculation is rife over whether Ten Hag will still be in charge of United next season, given they have missed out on qualifying for next season's Champions League. Outgoing Bayern Munich manager Thomas Tuchel is the latest high-profile manager to have been linked, but new minority owners INEOS are evaluating all of their options as they restructure the running of football operations.",
