Some retailers will choose not to reopen. And it will be their choice, on that day, and it will be their choice, when they do so.\"\n_\nA 19-year-old man has been arrested in relation to a riot in western Sydney following a stabbing attack at a church.\nThe riot broke out after Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel and other parishioners were stabbed during a live-streamed sermon at Christ the Good Shepherd Church in Wakeley on Monday.\nNew South Wales police say they've now executed a search warrant at a Doonside home where they arrested a 19-year-old, who has been taken to Blacktown Police Station.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese says he is concerned at the disrespect shown toward police.\n\"Police need to be respected at all times and people should allow them to go about their job. These are men and women who put themselves at risk in order to keep us safe and we should respect them. And I'm very concerned at the lack of respect we saw on Monday night in Sydney.\"\n_\nData from Flight Aware reveals more than 270 flights to and from Dubai International Airport are cancelled and a further 370 have been delayed because of flooded runways.\nThe airport has advised passengers not to turn up because of the very challenging conditions and has warned \"recovery will take some time\".\nTorrential rain in Gulf states has killed at least 20 people.\nMore thunderstorms, heavy rain and strong winds are forecast.\n_\nAn engineer employed by Boeing has told the US Congress he was physically threatened after raising serious safety concerns about two of Boeing's biggest planes, the 787 Dreamliner and the 777.\nThe Senate has held back-to-back hearings to hear from aviation experts and people who have worked at Boeing.\nQuality Engineer at Boeing Sam Salehpour told the hearing he has over 40 years' experience as an engineer and has come forward because he has serious concerns about both aircraft types, and is willing to take professional risks to talk about them.\n\"I literally saw people jumping on the pieces of the airplane to get them to align. I call it the Tarzan effect, among other improper methods. Again, I raised concerns internally. I was sidelined. I was told to shut up. I received physical threats. My my, my, my boss said I would have killed someone who said what you said in the meeting.\"\nNo Boeing representatives attended either hearing but the company has disputed the engineer's claims.\nThe company says claims about the Dreamliner's structural integrity are false.\nTwo Boeing engineering executives said in both design testing and inspections of planes — some of them 12 years old — there were no findings of fatigue or cracking in the composite panels.\nThe Boeing officials also dismissed Mr Salehpour's allegations that he saw factory workers jumping on sections of fuselage of the Boeing's 777 to make them align.\n_\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country would decide for itself how to respond to Iran's missile and drone attack with world leaders urging restraint.\nHe made the comments after meeting with the British Foreign Secretary David Cameron and his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock.\nIran has vowed to hit back if Israel responds to attack, which itself was launched in retaliation for a deadly strike on Iran's Damascus consulate building earlier this month.\n_\nIn football,\nManchester City will attempt to utilise the home advantage as they host 14-time Champions League winners Real Madrid, following a 3-all draw in Madrid.\nA single-goal win for either side will be sufficient to see them through to the next round, where they will take on the winners of the Bayern Munich-Arsenal tie.\nManchester City player Bernardo Silva says he and his teammates will do all they can to repeat last season's treble success.\n\"If we can win the two trebles in a row that no one did, that would be legacy. So, that's definitely motivation, knowing that it's very, very difficult because as I said, in one week, we could be out of all the competitions, but we’re fighting.\"",
