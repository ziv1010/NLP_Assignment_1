  "body_text": "Something for the weekend: Ruben Amorim, manager for football club Manchester United, made headlines this week by announcing that he will pay for 30 members of the club’s backroom staff to take their families to the Europa League final.\nThis generous and personal gesture is in response to being told by the club that the coaches, physios and support team would have to pay for their own tickets to travel to the final, which will be held in Bilbao, Spain on 21 May. Manchester United is set to play Tottenham Hotspur, aiming to win the Europa League and a place in next season’s Champions League.\nDuring a press conference held on 14 May, Amorim was asked by journalists about what led to him deciding to personally pay out so the families of backroom employees could attend the game.\nHe explained that after various changes at the club amid its aim to improve its financial situation, he wanted to help out. A discussion with the players about it led to the same decision.\nAmorim said: “We had a lot of things, people leaving, a lot of changes in the staff. In this moment, for our club, sometimes it’s hard to understand when to give, when to take, to respect the people… in certain moments to survive and to rebuild. It’s complicated for the club to start giving to other members of staff, so it’s a hard position.\n“My reaction was to help because it’s not going to change my life. To help the staff be there and to be comfortable, to be better staff for the final. Everybody wants the staff and their families to be there. It’s a simple thing.”\nThis is a wonderful gesture for anyone to make for their staff, we’re sure they felt appreciated and valued by this reward!",
