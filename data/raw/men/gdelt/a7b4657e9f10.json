If everything is positive, he will then be able to leave with his national team,\" said the Sunderland boss earlier this week.\nAdditionally, Luke O'Nien (suspended) and Aji Alese (shoulder) are unavailable for selection.\nBrighton vs Sunderland: Expected line-ups\nFourFourTwo's prediction\nBrighton 1-0 Sunderland\nWe have a sneaky feeling Brighton will continue their good home form and pick up a big three points against Sunderland.\nWe test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses.
