We've got you covered. Brentford vs Tottenham is on Sky Sports in the UK. Brit abroad? Use a VPN to watch the Premier League with your subscription from anywhere.\nBrentford welcome Tottenham to west London for each side's first test of the 2023/24 Premier League season, and both sides have something to prove in the new campaign.\nLast time out Brentford were hugely impressive under Thomas Frank, but with Ivan Toney missing until January, there remains a question mark over who will score the goals for the Bees and what state they might be in upon his return.\nOn the other side, Spurs have to dispel their demons of last term under new manager Ange Postecoglou. Bringing in James Maddison, Manor Solomon, Micky van de Ven and goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario will certainly help, while the lack of European football also offers the Australian more time to work with his players.\nKick-off is at 2pm BST. Make sure you know how to watch the Premier League wherever you are.\nTeam news\nThomas Frank has named the following Brentford starting 11: (3-5-2) Mark Flekken; Nathan Collins, Ethan Pinnock, Kristoffer Ajer; Aaron Hickey, Vitaly Janelt, Christian Norgaard (captain), Mathias Jensen, Rico Henry; Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa\nAnge Postecoglou has selected the following Tottenham starting 11: (4-2-3-1) Guglielmo Vicario; Emerson Royal, Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven, Iyenoma Udogie; Yves Bissouma, Oliver Skipp; Dejan Kulusevksi, James Maddison, Son Heung-min (captain); Richarlison\nForm\nBrentford were in fine form last term, finishing ninth in the Premier League with 59 points. Ivan Toney is a loss, though, and their pre-season results have left little to be desired - they failed to win any of their five games.\nAnge Postecoglou has bought a fresh breath of air with to Spurs, but the ongoing speculation about Harry Kane's future certainly hasn't helped. Still, it can't get much worse than the eighth-place finish of last season, regardless of what happens with Kane.\nReferee\nRobert Jones will be the referee for Brentford vs Tottenham. His assistants will be Ian Hussin and Wade Smith, with Jarred Gillett the fourth official. Tony Harrington is the VAR, with Dan Robathan the assistant VAR.\nStadium\nBrentford vs Tottenham will be played at the 17,250-capacity Gtech Community Stadium in Brentford, London.\nKick-off and channel\nBrentford vs Tottenham kick-off is at 2pm BST on Sunday 13 August in the UK. The game is on Sky Sports Premier League and Sky Sports Main Event in the UK.\nIn the US, kick-off time is 9am ET / 6am PT. The match will be shown on NBC in the US. See below for international broadcast options.\nVPN guide\nUse a VPN to watch Premier League football from outside your country\nIf you’re out of the country for a Premier League fixture, then you won't be able to watch on your domestic streaming service as usual. The broadcaster knows where you are because of your IP address (boo!) and blocks you from watching it. You can use a VPN to get around that, though, without resorting to illegal feeds you’ve found on Reddit.\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN), assuming it complies with your broadcaster’s T&Cs, creates a private connection between your device and t'internet, meaning the service can’t work out where you are and will let you watch. And all the info going between is entirely encrypted, anonymous and safe – and that's a result.\nThere are plenty of good-value options out there. For the Premier League, FourFourTwo currently recommends:\nExpressVPN including a 30-day, money-back guarantee\nFourFourTwo’s brainy office mates TechRadar love its super speedy connections, trustworthy security and the fact it works with Android, Apple, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, PS5 and loads more. You also get a money-back guarantee, 24/7 support and it's currently available for a knockdown price.
