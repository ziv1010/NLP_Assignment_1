This shortcoming ultimately proved very costly.\nAhead of the fixture, Skinner has warned that United must avoid “grasping” to keep their fate firmly in their own hands.\nHe also expressed optimism that United will get the job done and advance to the next round of the competition.\nSkinner issues warning\nThe United head coach said in his press conference [as quoted by WSL Full-Time], “Absolutely, it’s really important [to qualify]. When you have a game that you know you’ve got to win, it becomes a cup game, it’s a knockout game. In the past few years, in the FA Cup, we’ve been pretty good in those situations.”\n“We know the magnitude of it but the reality is, it’s about staying in the zone and in the streamline rather than grasping for it. You can’t grasp for these games, you’ve got to move the opponent. If we can do that, we can create the chances and then we’re at the mercy of ourselves and the football gods.”\n“It’s really important not to underestimate that. We’ve got to play it like we’ve shown the maturity over the years and do our very best in that moment.”\nSkinner continued, “We are creating enough chances, so it can’t be the system, it has to be the opportunity and focus in the moment. We said to the players that the system delivers you to the end outcome and then you take the moment, that’s all that football is.”\n“People talk about systems and shapes but all they do is move players on the field to occupy space that the opponent leaves you.”\n“At some point, Brann will play a four or five at the back and we have to be prepared for both. What we do well is create the chances and all I want us to do is have a little bit more composure. Also, if I’m being really honest, it’s just about getting used to each other and building relationships.”\nSkinner pointed out that United’s home advantage could be crucial in getting them over the line.\nUnited vs. Brann kicks off at 7 pm.\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
