We are focusing in each match trying to get our best — and to be in Europe is one clear objective we have.\n“The first way to get Europe is through the Premier League, but also getting the trophy in the FA Cup.\n“Now, we can’t choose only one competition. We are choosing both competitions strongly because we have two ways for our positive season to end.”\nThe FA Cup represents a chance for Emery’s first trophy in English football, and victory over Palace would clinch their first appearance in the final since 2015.\n“As a coach, my challenge when I arrived here was to get some trophies along the way,” he said.\n“We have an opportunity because we are in the semi-final, but there is a lot of work to do.\n“When you are getting experiences and getting trophies, the most important thing I learned and I enjoyed was the way and not the end.\n“I want to enjoy the semi-final, everything we are going to do — travelling to London, being together, preparing the match, the atmosphere in Wembley.”\nEmery’s only previous visit to Wembley as a manager was when he was in charge at Arsenal, playing against Tottenham in a league match while Spurs’ new stadium was being built.\n“I like it, and tomorrow I will enjoy it. Of course, I have a huge responsibility to try to respond in [a] good way with the players,” he said of returning to the iconic national stadium.\n“But I’m so excited playing matches like tomorrow, and the possibility we will have.”\nSATURDAY’S GAME\n11:15 am — Crystal Palace vs Aston Villa\nSUNDAY’S GAME\n10:30 am — Nott Forest vs Man City",
