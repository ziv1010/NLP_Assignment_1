  "body_text": "This might become known as the extraordinary week in which Barcelona president Joan Laporta intervened in Xavi’s plans — and weakened the head coach’s position in the dugout in the process.\nEarly in the week, Xavi rested three players from his Champions League squad. By Wednesday night, they were back in the group for that evening’s final group game away against Antwerp.\nThe Athletic can reveal:\n- A go-karting trip was partly responsible for Laporta insisting players were restored to the squad\n- That former Barca playing great Xavi is still being backed by the club’s hierarchy\n- But the upcoming La Liga away game against Valencia on Saturday is seen as crucial\nOn Monday, when Barcelona announced the squad that would travel for Wednesday’s final Champions League group-stage fixture in Antwerp, four first-team names were missing: Ronald Araujo, Robert Lewandowski, Frenkie de Jong and Ilkay Gundogan.\nAdvertisement\nBarcelona had already qualified for the next stage of the Champions League and secured first place, so Xavi wanted to rest the players. But on Tuesday there was a change in the squad, made public just moments before the team were due to board their flight to Belgium. Araujo, Lewandowski and Gundogan all came back in. De Jong did not travel, as he was ill.\nSome of the reasons for the last-minute change of plans, with sporting director Deco also included in the decision-making, are still emerging.\nSenior club sources familiar with the situation — who, like all sources cited here, preferred to speak anonymously to protect their position — confirmed this came about after a direct intervention from Laporta, and that his motivation for insisting senior players return to the group was heavily informed by a sense the team should not be taking things easy at a testing time, with the performance in a 4-2 home loss to Catalan neighbours Girona on Sunday far from the only disappointment of the season.\nAnd a group activity last week led to an image problem that caused Laporta’s intervention.\nFollowing the 1-0 home victory against Atletico Madrid on Sunday, December 3 and the recovery sessions the following day, Barcelona’s players were given the Tuesday and Wednesday off. Then, after training on the Thursday, several first-team players went go-karting in their spare time. It was planned by the coaching staff, who saw it as a team-building activity.\nIt’s not the first time the club had organised outings like this, and coaching-staff sources alluded to similar examples from the past such as in 2015, when Barca’s manager Luis Enrique brought the whole first-team group to Port Aventura, a theme park near the city, in an attempt to lift dressing-room spirits.\nBut the result in their first game after the go-karting session caused an issue as, three days later, Xavi’s side were soundly beaten by visitors Girona, the surprise La Liga leaders. Having previously just been viewed as a friendly fellow Catalan club, the victory means Girona are now seven points ahead of Barca. Xavi’s defending champions are now fourth, behind Girona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.\nAdvertisement\nThe manner of the defeat was just as concerning for Barcelona’s leadership. Senior club sources told The Athletic: “We were beaten by a club that played our style of football and did it great.”\nIt is fair to say that if Barcelona had won that Catalan derby, the go-karting trip wouldn’t have caused such a big issue among the board — although questions over whether the team are training enough have been present for a long time.\nThe coaching staff, meanwhile, do not agree that a lack of training is a reason for the performances. According to them, over the last 84 days (excluding international breaks), the players have trained on 57 of them and were involved in matchday routines on 19. They claim there were only eight free days.\nOn Thursday morning, there were also reports in local media over an alleged agitated conversation between De Jong and Deco, which is said to have taken place when the player communicated he was feeling unwell and could not travel to Antwerp.\nBarcelona sources did not hesitate to deny the rumours, ensuring this was not the case. There was a phone conversation between the footballer and the executive, they say, but it was conducted on cordial terms with total understanding of the situation.\nDe Jong called club doctor Ricard Pruna in the early hours of Tuesday to notify him he was ill. Hours later, the club decided it was better for him not to travel to Belgium with the team.\nThere was a financial fear behind restoring the three first-team players to the squad too.\nClub executives had, as reported by The Athletic, previously expressed worries about missing out on the revenue that comes from winning Champions League games — each victory in the group is worth €2.8million (£2.4m; $3.1m) from UEFA, while a draw nets €930,000.\nOn November 7, Barcelona lost 1-0 away against Shakhtar Donetsk on Champions League matchday four. Ten days later, the club announced they would travel to the United States later this month to play a friendly in Dallas, Texas against Mexican side Club America.\nClub sources say that match is expected to earn Barcelona about €4million.\nAdvertisement\nThe friendly is scheduled for 8pm local time next Thursday, December 21 (so 2am GMT/3am CET on December 22), even though Xavi’s side will finish their final La Liga match before the Christmas break, at home against Almeria, at around 9pm Spanish time (8pm GMT/2pm Dallas time) the previous day, and it’s around an 11-hour flight from Barcelona to the U.S. city.\nWednesday night in Antwerp, though, ranks as a failed intervention from the club’s highest ranks.\nOf the three players who were included at the last minute in the travelling squad, Araujo did not even make the bench because he was a booking away from missing the round of 16 tie’s first leg due to suspension, Gundogan came on in the 60th minute in a bid to turn around a 2-1 deficit and Lewandowski went from rested to starting in a day.\nBarcelona still lost, 3-2.\nLewandowski has played the fourth-most minutes in the squad this season at age 35 and Xavi planned to spare him the game in Belgium. However, as soon as the striker came into the travelling group, his permanent desire to play and the need to keep harmony in the dressing room meant Xavi opted to start him. Lewandowski was taken off on 72 minutes, even though Barca were still trailing 2-1.\nLaporta’s intervention has seen Barca lose out on that win bonus anyway (Antwerp scored a stoppage-time winner after the visitors seemed to have snatched a draw by equalising moments earlier), damaged morale and put additional pressure on Xavi’s situation.\nApart from the divided opinions over the go-karting trip, sources close to the president wanted to insist on Thursday how their faith in the head coach is very much alive. Xavi has also been reassured the president’s trust remains untouched.\nBut this is Barcelona, and the next La Liga match away against Valencia on Saturday night is labelled as a crucial point of Xavi’s time in the dugout.\n(Top photos: Getty Images)",
