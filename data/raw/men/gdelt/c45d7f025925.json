Today we have qualified for Europe. It’s remarkable,” said Brest coach Eric Roy.\nThe top three teams in Ligue 1 qualify automatically for next season’s expanded Champions League, with the team in fourth entering the competition in the preliminary rounds.\nIsmaily and Yusuf Yazici scored Lille’s goals as they came from behind to take all three points after Georges Mikautadze put Metz ahead from the penalty spot.\nNice strengthened their grip on fifth spot by winning 3-1 at Patrick Vieira’s Strasbourg.\nThe Cote d’Azur club remain four points behind Lille, meaning Champions League qualification looks to be beyond them.\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored his 27th goal of the season and Pape Gueye netted a late winner as Marseille beat Lens 2-1 to go seventh.\nLorient remain in the automatic relegation spots and three points from safety after a 2-1 home loss to Toulouse.\nClermont are still bottom but are now only four points from safety with three games left after beating Reims 4-1 with Austrian international Muhammed Cham netting two penalties and Elbasan Rashani also scoring twice.\nAFP",
