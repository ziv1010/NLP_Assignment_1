  "body_text": "Newcastle vs Liverpool LIVE: Premier League latest score and updates as Darwin Nunez goal opens scoring\nNewcastle host Liverpool in a crucial Premier League meeting that could determine which of the two teams finishes the season inside the top four.\nEddie Howe’s side have been in the Champions League spots for most of the season and the 2-1 defeat they suffered at Anfield in August remains their only loss of the Premier League campaign so far but they have taken a stumble following three consecutive draws, which has given some hope to the chasing pack.\nIn contrast, Liverpool will look to back up their 2-0 win over Everton in the Merseyside derby on Monday. Jurgen Klopp’s side, who have a game in hand over Newcastle, would close the gap on the Magpies to three points should they win that spare match and earn a victory today but a defeat would surely rule out any chance of a top four finish.\nFollow the action as Newcastle take on Liverpool at St. James’ Park:\nNewcastle vs Liverpool\nNewcastle host Liverpool in the Premier League in match that could have big implications on top four race\nNewcastle have drawn last three league games, Liverpool back to winning ways after 2-0 victory over Everton\nNewcastle XI: Pope, Trippier, Schar, Botman, Burn, Longstaff, Joelinton, Anderson, Almiron, Isak, Saint-Maximin\nLiverpool XI: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson, Fabinho, Henderson, Bajcetic, Salah, Nunez, Gakpo\n10’ GOAL! - Nunez opens scoring for Liverpool (NEW 0-1 LIV)\nNewcastle United FC 0 - 1 Liverpool FC\nNewcastle 0-1 Liverpool\n17:46 , Michael Jones\n16 mins: Liverpool are coming alive. Mo Salah slips into the box but loses possession. The ball comes out to Jordan Henderson who rolls it over to Trent Alexander-Arnold.\nAlexander-Arnold’s low curling cross bounces over to the far post but Kieran Trippier is on hand to turn it out for a corner.\nThe home side then defend it without too much trouble.\nNewcastle 0-1 Liverpool\n17:45 , Michael Jones\n13 mins: That goal has come against the run of play but Liverpool have so much attacking talent that they’re always a threat. The goal won’t change things for Newcastle yet. They’ll still take the game to Liverpool and now look for an equaliser.\nGOAL! Newcastle 0-1 Liverpool (Nunez, 10’)⚽️\n17:42 , Michael Jones\n10 mins: That’ll do! Trent Alexander-Arnold comes inside as Fabinho gets the ball and flicks it back to him. The Liverpool defender floats the ball over the top and expertly picks out Darwin Nunez.\nAfter splitting Fabian Schar and Kieran Trippier, Nunez brings the ball down with a lovely first touch then smoking a right-footed finish into the bottom left corner!\nNewcastle 0-0 Liverpool\n17:40 , Michael Jones\n9 mins: Newcastle’s press is a strong one. Mo Salah is forced to retreat towards his own box before giving the ball to Joe Gomez who returns it to Alisson. The goalkeeper then boots it out of play and gets jeered at from the Newcastle fans.\nLiverpool need to get into this match.\nNewcastle 0-0 Liverpool\n17:36 , Michael Jones\n6 mins: Nice play from Allan Saint-Maximin on the left wing. He carries the ball down the line and storms into the box before lifting one across goal. Alexander Isak is up there but Virgil van Dijk is first to the ball and nods it away.\nNewcastle have started quickly. They’re on the front foot here.\nNewcastle 0-0 Liverpool\n17:35 , Michael Jones\n3 mins: Miguel Almiron nicks the ball off Stefan Bajcetic and drives into the Liverpool box. He looks to shoot but gets swarmed and loses the ball.\nNewcastle recycle it though and slip the ball back to him in the box. Joe Gomez is playing him onside but his prodded shot on target is closed down by Alisson.\nSolid save!\nKick off: Newcastle 0-0 Liverpool\n17:31 , Michael Jones\nThe players are wearing black armbands and there’s a moments silence before kick off to remember Christian Atsu, a former Newcastle United player, who passed away during the earthquakes in Turkey.\nAfter the showing of respect Jordan Henderson gets the match started at St. James’ Park.\nNewcastle vs Liverpool\n17:26 , Michael Jones\nThis is a really intriguing contest. Newcastle have the best defence in the league and the last time they lost was against Liverpool at Anfield.\nWith home advantage and at the top of their game Newcastle should have enough to beat Liverpool but Jurgen Klopp’s men can turn it on at the drop of a hat. Their problem this season has been consistency.\nThe players make their way out onto the pitch, kick off is up next.\nNewcastle vs Liverpool\n17:24 , Michael Jones\nMo Salah has scored nine goals in nine Premier League appearances against teams managed by Eddie Howe. He has not netted more than six Premier League goals versus any other manager.\nHe is just two Premier League goals away from Robbie Fowler’s Liverpool record of 128.\nPlaying like Almiron\n17:21 , Michael Jones\nMiguel Almiron has 10 goals in 22 top-flight appearances this season but has not scored in any of his last four home league games.\nNewcastle vs Liverpool\n17:17 , Michael Jones\nAlexander Isak scored on his Newcastle debut in the reverse fixture against Liverpool. The last Magpies player to net home and away league goals against the Reds in the same season was Alan Shearer in 1999/00.\nNewcastle vs Liverpool\n17:13 , Michael Jones\nLiverpool have lost nine of their 16 away matches in all competitions this campaign. They have only fared worse in one of the past 10 seasons, suffering 12 defeats in 2014/15.\nThey have not kept a Premier League clean sheet outside of Liverpool since a 1-0 win at Newcastle in April.\nNewcastle vs Liverpool\n17:09 , Michael Jones\nEddie Howe has lost 14 of his 16 matches as a manager versus Liverpool in all competitions.\nTo add to that unwanted stat, Newcastle are winless in all five Premier League fixtures without Bruno Guimaraes this season (D4, L1).\nNewcastle vs Liverpool\n17:05 , Michael Jones\nNewcastle’s only defeat in their last 21 Premier League home games was 1-0 versus Liverpool in April 2022.\nThis is the first time Newcastle face Liverpool in the Premier League while at least five places above the Reds since September 2006, when 15th-placed Liverpool beat Newcastle 2-0 at Anfield.\nElsewhere in the Premier League\n17:01 , Michael Jones\nThere are some of the 3pm kicks off finishing off right now we some surprising results. Everton have beaten Leeds 1-0 and are out of the relegation zone for the time-being.\nNottingham Forest have scored right at the death to draw 1-1 with Manchester City allowing Arsenal to open up a two point lead at the top of the table once more.\nBournemouth have edged it 1-0 at Wolves and Brentford recover to draw 1-1 with Crystal Palace. Fulham defeated Brighton 1-0 but Chelsea vs Southampton (0-1) is still in stoppage time following an injury to Cesar Azpilicueta.\nThe best defence in the league\n16:58 , Michael Jones\nNewcastle have the best defensive record in the division, conceding just 13 goals. Only Manchester City and Liverpool have scored multiple Premier League goals versus the Magpies this campaign.\nCan Liverpool score past them again today?\nNewcastle vs Liverpool\n16:54 , Michael Jones\nNewcastle have drawn five of their last six Premier League fixtures, including each of the last three. They could do with a win though to get them moving in the table once again.\nLiverpool and Newcastle have it all to prove in Premier League’s frosty rivalry\n16:50 , Michael Jones\nWith a bit less injury time at Anfield, Newcastle might still be the Tyneside Invincibles. As it is, their longest unbeaten run in the top flight has amounted to a remarkable response to unwanted late drama. Fabio Carvalho’s August winner for Liverpool came in the 98th minute and, 17 league games later, it is still the case that no one has beaten Newcastle; or no one except Sheffield Wednesday in an FA Cup tie anyway.\nInclude Carabao Cup encounters and Newcastle have played 27 matches against their Premier League peers this season and lost just one. Keep that run going for another 10 days and, barring defeat on penalties, they will end a 54-year wait for major silverware.\nBut before then, Liverpool’s visit to St James’ Park is laden with pertinence. They were the last visitors to win there, with a Naby Keita goal for a quadruple-chasing side in April. Now it is fourth place Liverpool want and fourth place Newcastle occupy. If United’s season has exceeded all expectations so far, the next three games may shape it: Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City.\nLiverpool and Newcastle have it all to prove in Premier League’s frosty rivalry\nA weak defence\n16:46 , Michael Jones\nLiverpool could lose four successive Premier League away games for the first time since April 2012, when the fourth fixture was a 2-0 loss at Newcastle.\nThe Reds could also concede at least three goals in four straight away league fixtures for the first time since 1954.\nA strong defence\n16:42 , Michael Jones\nNewcastle have equalled the club record of 17 league games without defeat since losing 2-1 to Liverpool in August.\nThe Magpies have not conceded more than once in any of those 17 games. Their longest league run without conceding at least twice is 18 matches, set in 2004.\nNewcastle vs Liverpool\n16:38 , Michael Jones\nJoe Willock is out for Newcastle today due to a hamstring issue that he has not been able to shake. That means that Elliot Anderson makes his full Premier League debut for the Magpies.\nWillock has been a creator and driving force for Newcastle in midfield this year, can Anderson fill his shoes?\nNewcastle vs Liverpool team changes\n16:34 , Michael Jones\nEddie Howe makes just one change to the Newcastle team that drew with Bournemouth last time out. Joe Willock drops out with Elliot Anderson taking his place in midfield.\nJurgen Klopp welcomes back Virgil van Dijk who partners Joe Gomez in central defence for Liverpool. Joel Matip drops to the bench for the Reds.\nNewcastle vs Liverpool line-ups\n16:31 , Michael Jones\nNewcastle XI: Pope, Trippier, Schar, Botman, Burn, Longstaff, Joelinton, Anderson, Almiron, Isak, Saint-Maximin\nHOWAY NEWCASTLE! ✊\n⚫️⚪️ pic.twitter.com/VMAyeKSFFL— Newcastle United FC (@NUFC) February 18, 2023\nLiverpool XI: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson, Fabinho, Henderson, Bajcetic, Salah, Nunez, Gakpo\nThe Reds to take on Newcastle today 📋🔴#NEWLIV\n— Liverpool FC (@LFC) February 18, 2023\nNewcastle vs Liverpool\n16:27 , Michael Jones\nLiverpool have come from behind to beat Newcastle 10 times in the Premier League, including a 2-1 win in the reverse fixture this season.\nIt is a joint Premier League record along with Manchester United’s tallies of 10 comeback triumphs versus Newcastle and Southampton.\nNewcastle vs Liverpool\n16:25 , Michael Jones\nNewcastle are winless in 12 Premier League meetings between the teams since a 2-0 home victory in December 2015.\nIn contrast Liverpool are unbeaten in five league games at Newcastle.

This game will have some big implications on the race for the top four with Liverpool needing to win to have any hopes of earning Champions League football next year.\nNewcastle currently sit fourth in the table, five places and nine points ahead of Liverpool. If Eddie Howe’s side were to win today then they will effectively put an end to Liverpool’s chances of competing for a top four spot going 12 points ahead of Jurgen Klopp’s men.\nLiverpool, who have a game in hand on Newcastle, could cut that gap down to six if they win at St. James’ Park. The Reds are hoping to build off the back of a 2-0 win in the Merseyside derby where Darwin Nunez, Mo Salah and Cody Gakpo finally seemed to gel in the forward line.\nTheir task will be to break down an incredible Newcastle defence which has been one of the strongest in the league this year.

Instead, Mikel Arteta’s side stand up, in the most scarcely possible way possible. On a thunderous afternoon at Villa Park, Jorginho’s stunning strike from the edge of the box cannoned off the underside of the crossbar, rebounding off the back of former Arsenal goalkeeper Emi Martinez, denying former Arsenal manager Unai Emery, and, somehow, keeping Arsenal’s Premier League title bid alive.\nThis was a statement response from Arteta’s challengers: they faced not only the shortest possible turnaround from Wednesday’s defeat at home to title rivals Manchester City, a result that threatened to suck the air out of their challenge as Pep Guardiola’s side returned to the top of the table, but also an Aston Villa side who sensed an opportunity. This was as good a time to play Arsenal as you could hope for, and yet as Gabriel Martinelli raced away to score Arsenal’s fourth into an empty net in the 98th minute, sealing a 4-2 comeback win, it’s hard to imagine how Arteta’s team could have reacted to their defeat to City in a better way.\nThe scenes in the away end at full-time told you that, and with the four-game blip is over, it’s now about how this dramatic lift win can lift Arsenal and give them a second wind in the title race. Manchester CIty will certainly feel it. But at times here, Arsenal’s dip in form threatened to turn into a five-game slump, especially as first Ollie Watkins and then Philippe Coutinho fired Villa in front, before Villa rattled the crossbar when chasing a winner late on.\nArsenal bounce back to seal stunning late comeback win over Aston Villa\nFT Aston Villa 2-4 Arsenal\n14:58 , Michael Jones\nReaction from Arsenal midfielder Jorginho who told BT Sport: “That’s the Premier League. That’s why it’s the best league in the world. It’s just beautiful.\n“It was very important after the last results we had. The start wasn’t easy when we were not producing our game. We came in at half-time, had a chat and then we went back doing the basics we need to do and changed the game.\n“The last time I hit the post and it went back off the keeper it didn’t go in so I’m glad today it did.”\nFT Aston Villa 2-4 Arsenal\n14:55 , Michael Jones\nReaction from Arsenal goalscorer Oleksandr Zinchenko: “From this game I would like to say two things. First we took an unbelievable lesson for all of us that we need to believe until the very end.\n“Like I said in the past, this group has such amazing people, can achieve everything they want. If we are going to keep fighting and keep believing. The reaction from all of us in the second half is a perfect way to go.\n“I’m so happy to help with my goal but most important is to take the three points.\n“We would like to go in the dressing room as soon as possible but there are still a lot of games to play and we just need to keep going, keep fighting and keep believing we can do everything.”\nFT Aston Villa 2-4 Arsenal\n14:52 , Michael Jones\nArsenal have won a Premier League game they were losing at half-time outside of London for the first time since December 2009 when they beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield.\nFT Aston Villa 2-4 Arsenal\n14:49 , Michael Jones\nGabriel Martinelli’s goal is his first goal contribution in 7 Premier League games, ending his longest run without a goal or assist since April 2021.\nFT Aston Villa 2-4 Arsenal\n14:46 , Michael Jones\nAston Villa have conceded 4+ goals in consecutive home matches for only the second time in their top-flight history, with the previous instance coming in 1935/36.\nFT Aston Villa 2-4 Arsenal\n14:43 , Michael Jones\nOleksandr Zinchenko has scored his first goal in the Premier League in his 92nd appearance in the competition, with what was his 74th shot.\nHe is Arsenal’s 13th different scorer in the Premier League this season, the most of any team (excluding own goals).\nFT Aston Villa 2-4 Arsenal\n14:40 , Michael Jones\nArsenal are back on top.\nA wonderful encounter at Villa Park saw the Gunners twice fight back after going behind before two goals in stoppage time - the first a lucky own goal off the back of Emi Martinez’s head and the second a counter-attack with Aston Villa chasing an equaliser - sees them jump back ahead of Manchester City a reclaim top spot in the league.\nThis was an important victory for Mikel Arteta’s men.

They couldn’t, could they?\nSkip forward to Wednesday night, as Erling Haaland fired home City’s third, and Arsenal’s lead at the top of the Premier League was no more.\nIf a month feels a long time in today’s unrelenting footballing world, Mikel Arteta and his Arsenal squad will now appreciate that better than most.\nThere can be no period of reflection, no time to lick the wounds.

The mood was “down”. Arteta attempted to rouse them by saying they just needed to figure out why they lost in order to improve on it, and “move on”.\nA problem is now how the season evolves from here, though.
