  "body_text": "A Supercomputer has predicted that Arsenal will win the Premier League but disagrees with Gary Neville over how many points they’ll need to be champions.\nArsenal enjoyed a perfect weekend, beating Crystal Palace 1-0 while their main title rivals Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea all lost.\nAs a result, they are four points clear of surprise package Bournemouth at the top of the table, winning seven and losing just one of nine games, while conceding just three goals.\nMoreover, the Gunners lead the Citizens by six points, the Reds by seven and the Blues by eight.\nMany, including Neville, believe ‘this has got to be Arsenal’s year’, and the Manchester United legend has predicted just how many points they’ll need to lift the trophy.\n‘This is the fourth season on the bounce that I’ve had them to win the league,’ Neville said on his podcast. ‘They’re not necessarily miles better, they’re repeating their levels of consistency, and that’s all they’re going to have to do this year to win the league.\n‘They’re not going to have to go and get 100 points, they’re not going to have to get even 90 or 95 points to win the league, mid-80s, high 80s will win them this title, and they can do that.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

They’re very reliable. You can trust them. The way in which they defend is fantastic. They’re all around each other. They don’t concede goals.’\nMikel Arteta’s side have been runners-up in the last three seasons, finishing just short of Man City on 84 points in 2022/23 and 89 in 2023/24, and those tallies would have been enough to win the league last year ahead of Liverpool.\nBut, Aceodds’ supercomputer, BETSiE, is even more optimistic about Arsenal’s title hopes than Neville, tipping them to be worse off than the last few years, yet still finish ahead of their rivals.\nFollowing last weekend’s dramatic results, BETSiE predicts the Gunners will win the 2025/26 Premier League on around 82 points, with Liverpool about seven points behind in second.\nLike last season, Man City and Chelsea will follow, albeit some distance behind, with a resurgent Man Utd only just missing out on the top four ahead of Newcastle and Tottenham.\nWest Ham, Wolves and Burnley have been tipped to be relegated, while Sunderland, currently fourth after a sensational start to the season, will crash down to 15th.\nSupercomputer's projected Premier League table\n- Arsenal – 81.9pts\n- Liverpool – 74.5pts\n- Man City – 70.6pts\n- Chelsea – 63.1pts\n- Man Utd – 61.9pts\n- Newcastle – 59.7pts\n- Tottenham – 58.5pts\n- Bournemouth – 58.2pts\nArsenal’s next Premier League match is a trip to Burnley, but before then they have a tricky Carabao Cup clash against Brighton on Wednesday night.\nMore Trending\nCuriously, former England goalkeeper David James is one of the few people who doesn’t think the Gunners will win their first league title in 22 years.\nSpeaking in an exclusive interview with Metro, James said: ‘Now it’s how Mikel Arteta handles the balance of the Champions League and the Premier League, especially when you’re leading the Premier League.\n‘I don’t think Arsenal will win the title if that’s an answer, even if they’ve started well.\n‘I think the likes of Man City, Chelsea and Liverpool will go into the last weeks of the season, if not the last game of the season, and possibly decide the title race.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Manchester United academy star Rhys Bennett ‘broken’ after loving dad ‘takes his own life’\nMORE: Ex-Premier League star on how footballers’ lifestyles are shifting focus\nMORE: Former Liverpool coach and Real Madrid legend dies aged 64",
