  "body_text": "Gianluigi Donnarumma is ‘very interested’ in joining two Premier League clubs after effectively being banished by PSG.\nThe 26-year-old, a Champions League and Euros winner, was left out of PSG’s squad for Wednesday’s UEFA Super Cup against Tottenham.\nDonnarumma did not travel with his teammates to Udine, with new PSG signing Lucas Chevalier and back-up goalkeeper Renato Martin instead picked by Luis Enrique.\nEnrique later confirmed his decision was down to looking for a ‘different profile’ of goalkeeper, essentially ending Donnarumma’s highly successful PSG career.\n‘I am supported by my club and we are trying to find the best solution,’ Enrique said prior to PSG’s penalty shootout win over Spurs.\n‘It is a difficult decision. I only have praise for Donnarumma. He is one of the very best goalkeepers out there and an even better man.\n‘But we were looking for a different profile. It’s very difficult to take these types of decisions.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nDonnarumma was expected to sign a new contract with the French champions earlier in the summer but failed to agree a deal.\nWith his current deal set to expire next summer, PSG have taken the decision to cash in on the Italian in this transfer window.\nIn an emotional statement to the ‘special’ PSG fans, Donnarumma said he was ‘disappointed and disheartened’ to be exiled.\n‘I hope to have the opportunity to look the fans at the Parc des Princes in the eyes one more time and say goodbye as it should be done,’ he added.\n‘If that doesn’t happen, I want you to know that your support and affection mean the world to me, and I will never forget it.’\nThe shot-stopper’s agent, Enzo Raiola, then hit out at PSG for showing ‘zero respect’ to a player who has starred in four Ligue 1 title wins and of course last season’s Champions League victory.\nRaiola also hinted at a Premier League move for Donnarumma, saying: ‘We will consider solutions now, maybe in the Premier League there will be clubs able to pay what’s needed.\n‘The Premier League would be the right step in my view and we’re working on it. There are no talks with Italian clubs.’\nManchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea have all been linked with moves since the PSG bombshell.\nAccording to Italian journalist Aurelio Capaldi, speaking on The Transfers Podcast, Donnarumma is ‘very interested’ in joining Man City or Chelsea.\nIt is claimed Donnarumma is ‘fascinated’ by Pep Guardiola and would love to play under the legendary manager, but that he also likes the idea of living in London and appreciates Chelsea.\nMan City do appear to have genuine interest in Donnarumma but both Man United and Chelsea are briefing that they will not be making moves.\nThat would come as a surprise given Andre Onana and Robert Sanchez, the current number ones at Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge, have received widespread criticism.\nUnited have prioritised attacking signings this summer, spending almost £200m on Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.\nAs a new goalkeeper has not joined Ruben Amorim’s squad, Onana is set to start United’s Premier League opener against Arsenal on Sunday.\nChelsea, meanwhile, were interested in signing a new shot-stopper earlier in the summer but have seemingly changed their mind since failing to land Mike Maignan.\nMore Trending\nManchester City have expressed interest in signing Donnarumma as Turkish champions Galatasaray eye up a move for Ederson.\nBrazil international Ederson has been one of the best goalkeepers in the world over the past decade but he appeared to be on the decline last season.\nMan City re-signed James Trafford from Burnley last month to compete with and potentially replace Ederson but have still not ruled out a deal for Donnarumma.\nPSG begin their Ligue 1 title defence against Nantes on Sunday but Donnarumma will not be involved as he searches for a new club.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: ‘I played with Viktor Gyokeres – he’s not the one and will struggle at Arsenal’\nMORE: Manchester United set price to sign Sporting star as Ruben Amorim sanctions bid\nMORE: Liverpool boss Arne Slot makes Chelsea prediction after £250m spending spree",
