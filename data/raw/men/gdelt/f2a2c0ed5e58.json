  "body_text": "Eddie Howe has now weighed in on the debate over what Newcastle United should do with St James’ Park.\nEver since the change of ownership at Newcastle United, there has been talk of increasing the capacity to allow more fans to watch the team.\nThe preference has always been for Newcastle to stay at St James’ Park and expand, but that comes with a lot of complications. The ground is surrounded by listed buildings, which would make increasing the capacity of St James’ Park very challenging and very costly – but not impossible.\nHowever, it has recently been suggested that it could cost Newcastle £1billion to expand St James’ Park. In comparison, they could probably build a completely new stadium for that price.\nIt remains unclear what the club will do, with Newcastle set to make a decision in early 2025.\nEddie Howe is asked about Newcastle United’s St James’ Park dilemma\nSome Newcastle fans are coming round to the idea of a new stadium, while there are plenty of other Toon supporters who are desperate to remain at St James’ Park.\nBut what is Eddie Howe‘s stance on the stadium debate? He has given his verdict during his pre-match press conference for the Everton game.\n“Well, I think it’s a difficult one for someone like myself when people want to know my opinion – but I’m not faced with all the facts,” he said, as reported by the Chronicle.\n“I’m not sort of hearing the pros and cons behind all the decisions.\n“I think my natural instinct is always to stay at St James’ Park. It’s an incredible place to play football. It’s our home. So to sort of think about moving somewhere else feels a little bit of a betrayal to somewhere that’s served us so well.\n“But we are well aware that as a football club, we need to increase our revenue, so people with more brain cells [than me] will make the decision for the benefit of the long term future of the football club – and that’s always the most important thing.\n“So I could be swayed, but I feel my natural instinct is to want to stay.”\nLeaving St James’ Park is a big risk for Newcastle United\nAs Howe says, it would feel like a betrayal to leave St James’ Park. It is Newcastle United’s home. An iconic stadium in the middle of the city.\nWhen Newcastle United play at St James’ Park, it is special. The Magpies find an extra gear when they are in front of the Toon Army, as they showed 12 months ago when they obliterated PSG 4-1 in the Champions League.\nBut there is a need to grow as a club. Increasing revenue is vital, as PIF aim to take Newcastle United to the top. There may well be an argument that the only way to do that is to move to a new, purpose built stadium.\nIt is an incredibly difficult decision, and there are a plethora of arguments for both sides of the coin.\nHowever, like Howe, my ‘natural instinct’ is to remain at St James’ Park and try to increase its capacity.",
