Those who had bitten their tongue about his off-field flamboyance gave full vent to their feelings.\nNational headlines the next day included \"10 Heroic Lions, One Stupid Boy\" (Daily Mirror) and \"You're Just A Joke Becks\" (Daily Mail).\nMonths of \"hell\" followed, with death threats, spitting and boos accompanying Beckham wherever he went.\n\"Wherever I went I got abused, every single day,\" he said.\n\"I find it hard to talk through what I went through because it was so extreme. The whole country hated me.\"\nBut the ordeal only sharpened Beckham's focus.\nA year later, he finished second in the Ballon d'Or as he helped Manchester United claim an unprecedented treble, winning the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup.\nIt was often said that Beckham's career seemed to be scripted by a movie writer, never more so than when the fallen idol took his revenge by scoring the winning goal against perennial rivals Argentina in the 2002 World Cup, redeeming his national hero status.\nThe royal family were quick to embrace him, inviting Beckham to the weddings of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011 and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2018.\nPrevious rumors of an impending knighthood came to nothing, but his star once again rose in 2022 after the death of Queen Elizabeth II.\nWhile other celebrities came under fire for skipping the queue to view her coffin, Beckham lined up with members of the public for almost 12 hours to pay his respects.\nSince then, it has seemed that \"Sir David\" was only a matter of time in coming.\nby Alexandra DEL PERAL\nNo stories found.\nDaily Tribune\ntribune.net.ph",
