The Seagulls with only two points from their last four PL matches and in their very most recent one, drawing 2-2 at home to doomed Leicester after twice leading, a killer blow surely to any realistic chances of bothering the Champions League places. Brentford with one win in their last six PL games, only six points from a possible last 18. Any result possible but a draw most likely for me.\nPalace v Bournemouth – Palace with an FA Cup semi-final next Saturday, Newcastle handing them just their second away PL defeat since 21 October 2024. Palace needed a win at St James’ Park to retain any faint hopes of European football and must surely now be thinking only of that FA Cup opportunity. Bournemouth had picked up only two points in six games before clawing their way to that Monday night home win over Fulham. I have a feeling that Palace will bounce back to an extent at home, having won their last three PL matches at Selhurst Park. Newcastle fans set to see Bournemouth pick up a point at the very best, making it all but impossible to compete for a top five place.\nEverton v Man City – In the last three months, Man City have only won one PL away match, that was 1-0 at a woeful Spurs. Everton haven’t lost a home PL match for over three months. Until sneaking an injury time winner at Forest last time out, the previous six Everton PL matches (home and away) had included five draws. I think Everton will do Newcastle another favour today, with the scouse mackems picking up yet another draw.\nWest Ham v Southampton – Southampton continue their quest not to be the worst ever Premier League team of all time, they still need one point to match Derby’s all-time 11 points record. West Ham have only won three home Premier League matches in over six months. If they are going to do it, this is the kind of match where maybe the Saints could pick up a point, but nobody would be putting any money on it.\nAston Villa Newcastle United – The only match that really counts. Newcastle looking to make it seven wins in a row (all competitions), whilst Villa have won their last four PL matches. United have coasted through recent games, scoring 12 goals in their last three and improving the goal difference by plus ten. In contrast, the last week and a half for Villa has included two very tough shattering (mentally and physically) games against PSG. A tough contest but no reason why Newcastle can’t get yet another victory, if playing to recent levels.\nSunday 20 April\nFulham v Chelsea – The last time Chelsea won a PL match against a team currently in the top half of the Premier League, was back on 1 December 2024. They have scrambled a number of PL wins against those at the bottom, but couldn’t even do that last time, lucky to get a 2-2 draw at home to doomed Ipswich. Fulham have only lost two home Premier League games since November and have European aspirations of their own. They won 2-1 at Chelsea earlier this season and if Fulham complete the double on Sunday, they will be only three points behind their local rivals. I fancy Fulham to get that win against a Chelsea team lacking any character.\nIpswich v Arsenal – Ipswich are showing late fight but could be relegated as early as this weekend if results go against them. The last three games have seen Ipswich win 2-1 at Bournemouth, lead in-form Wolves until conceding two late goals, then take a 2-0 lead at Chelsea before ending that game 2-2. Arsenal have only won two of their last seven PL matches and with their focus ever increasingly on the Champions League, an opportunity for Newcastle to potentially finish as high as second has opened up. Arsenal scoring more than one goal on only a single occasion in these past seven PL matches, if Ipswich can score (they have only failed to do so once in their last 10 PL games), then every chance of more dropped points for Arsenal.\nMan U v Wolves – This is my banker of the weekend. Wolves have won their last four PL matches and I reckon for sure they will make it five at Old Trafford. They easily beat Man U 2-0 on Boxing Day, now they are set to do the double. There may have been a lot of drama in their European match on Thursday but there was so little quality, Man U absolutely fluking that win against 10 men Lyon. Man U have even less character than Chelsea and lower quality players. Man U have only won two home PL matches since 1 December 2024 and they were against relegation doomed Southampton and Ipswich. It is Wolves all the way to win this one.\nLeicester v Liverpool – Liverpool are stumbling to the title having lost 3-2 to Fulham and very lucky to get an 89th minute winner against West Ham. Having said that, whilst Leicester got a surprise draw at Brighton in their last match, the previous 16 had seen the Foxes lose 15 of them. Difficult to see anything but a win here for Liverpool and if Arsenal lose at Ipswich, the scousers have won the title.\nMonday 21 April\nSpurs v Forest – Defeats to Villa and Everton have suddenly put Forest under serious pressure, not a great help either that this match has been moved to the Monday night ahead of next weekend’s FA Cup semi-final against Man City. Tottenham have been a shambles and that includes their last six PL matches, four defeats and only one win, against rock bottom Southampton. Hopefully that hard fought win and clean sheet against Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday will help inspire Spurs to get at least a point against Forest. They have a fair few players now back available and having been handed a gift of a route to the final getting Bodo/Glimt in the semis, fingers crossed the flaky Spurs ‘stars’ will raise their game against Forest, playing for places in a potential Europa League final.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
