The Blues are scoring goals again, and that's an obvious positive, but there's still work to be done at the other end of the field, with Chelsea a little shaky in defence.\nPotter's play style was on show during the Everton game, with Chelsea perhaps as impressive in possession as they have been under the boss, and that's a major positive. Fans have begged to see some tactical improvement from their team for months now, and they might finally be getting it.\nHowever, one flaw which fans have picked up on during the recent matches is Potter's questionable in-game management. Defensive substitutions have been the priority as soon as Chelsea have gone ahead, with the manager more interested in attempting to maintain that lead instead of build on it.\nThere have definitely been steps forward, but as always, there's one or two going backwards as well.\nREAD NEXT\nHow Graham Potter can help Chelsea during the international break\nA lot of Chelsea's heavy hitters will be away on international duty, and so there's not a lot of tactical work Potter can do. While he obviously still needs to work out his best lineup, that will have to come later.\nIn the short term, Potter would be better off using this break to simply get out of the spotlight. The stage has been passed over to Gareth Southgate and the other international managers around the globe, allowing him to sink into the shadows and do his work quietly.\nThe boss must look at his tactics and beliefs and take some time to determine what can be improved upon, with a handful of behind-closed-doors friendlies set to offer some help in that respect.\nThose who have remained at Cobham will also have two weeks extra to continue their work on Potter's preferred style of football. He might just be getting through to the squad, and while the key players who need the strongest understanding of his methods may not be there, it's a chance to work with a smaller group and get those squad players up to speed.\nPotter also needs to ensure his players are fresh and healthy. Those who have not travelled with their countries can give their legs a break in anticipation of a massive few months of Champions League battles and scrapping for a spot in some form of European competition next season.\nChelsea's fixtures after the international break\n- 01/04/2023 - Chelsea vs Aston Villa (17:30)\n- 04/04/2023 - Chelsea vs Liverpool (20:00)\n- 08/04/2023 - Wolves vs Chelsea (15:00)\n- 12/04/2023 - Real Madrid vs Chelsea (20:00)\n- 15/04/2023 - Chelsea vs Brighton (15:00)\n- 18/04/2023 - Chelsea vs Real Madrid (20:00)\nLISTEN NOW\nOn this edition of Son of Chelsea, part of the 90min podcast network, Daniel Childs reviews Chelsea's 2-2 draw with Everton & Graham Potter's performance.
