In life, you always come to the moment when you have to make a decision. The ball is in his court now.\"\nThe Swiss have already recruited Inter Milan attacking midfielder Darian Males in recent days.\nFassnacht has 19 international caps and at YB has won the Swiss title five times and the cup twice since arriving from FC Thun in 2017.\nIn his absence, Young Boys needed a 97th minute winner from the penalty spot to beat Lausanne at home to get their Swiss Super League title defence underway.\nWagner was in charge for the 2021/22 season that saw YB finish third in the domestic league, but beat Manchester United in the Champions League, with Fassnacht playing in that tie.\nThe City boss has made no secret of his desire to add another addition in attacking areas this summer, after Spanish signing Borja Sainz was ruled out until October with an ankle injury.\nCity have also been linked with Portuguese winger Rafael Camacho in the last few days.\nThe Canaries signed Ashley Barnes, Jack Stacey and Shane Duffy in the first part of the transfer window, but have yet to make any further senior additions following the arrival of Sainz.\nNorwich are currently on tour in Austria and scheduled to play Toulouse on Tuesday in their penultimate friendly, before travelling back to England for their final tune up against Olympiacos at Carrow Road.",
