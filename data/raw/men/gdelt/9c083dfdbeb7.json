  "body_text": "The transfer merry-go-round continues without a pause. Manchester United will line up at the start of the season with Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. Fortunately for the Red Devils, AC Milan have reported their interest in United’s striker, Rasmus Hojlund and with Viktor Gyokores moving to the Emirates with Arsenal.\nBenjamin Sesko and Nicolas Jackson are being carefully looked at by United’s recruitment department.\nAs I reported to you, Chelsea have signed Joao Pedro and Liam Delap, who have already made their presence felt for the Blues. Jackson is now a third choice striker, but Coach Enzo Maresca believes he can still turn him into the £100 million player Chelsea thought they were buying. A move away with either a sale or loan is still possible and a bid by United would be seriously considered, but I think Nicolas could remain at Stamford Bridge from what I have been told.\nMbuemo will have a contract with United until June 2031, which includes a year’s option.\nUnited have a tough opening Premier League match on 17th August at home to Arsenal, which is a sell-out.\nNottingham Forest are about to help out United by moving for Jadon Sancho, who has no future at Old Trafford under Ruben Amorim. Owner Evangelos Marinakis has agreed to make the money available to take Jadon to the City Ground, having lost Anthony Elanga to Newcastle.\nFrank starts with winning ways at Tottenham\nI seem to be writing a lot about Spurs this weekend, but with a new coach and experimenting with pre-season team line-ups, it seems a good place to start.\nIn a game against Reading, Thomas Frank played two teams, changing at half time.\nHere is an assessment of the new players and Frank’s style of management. Cristiano Romero lead the first half team with Rodrigo Bentacur, Pedro Porro, Dominic Solanke and Brennan Johnson all trying but failing to break through Reading’s defence. Captain Son Heung-min led the team out for the second half, and within four minutes, Spurs put the ball into the net.\nThe new signings and one academy graduate showed what they could do. Mohammed Kudus took a corner and placed it away from the goalkeeper, while Luka Vuskovic headed the ball on and Will Lankshear nodded in the goal. Nice work from the trio. Kudus and Vuskovic linked up again when the midfielder pushed the ball onto the advancing Vuskovic who slotted a perfect low shot into the corner of the net.\nThomas Frank was pleased with his team’s first performance under his guidance and greeted his players when they came off with his usual big smile and charismatic father like arm around shoulders. He has already won the respect and approval of his players.\nRelax Magpie fans, Isak is going nowhere\nSeveral readers of this column have asked me why Newcastle’s Alexander Isak has been training alone this week. Relax Magpie supporters, it is not because the Swedish international has been demanding a wage rise to £300k a week, which would bust Newcastle’s pay structure and nor is it because his head has been turned by interest from Liverpool and the Saudi Pro League.\nIsak hurt his thigh in training after suffering with groin stress at the end of last season and it was painful enough for the club to send him for a scan, which fortunately did not reveal anything serious. Coach Eddie Howe decided that to protect his valuable striker he would not train with the other players, which could have put him at risk until the thigh is healed.\nArsenal’s ace card if they go for Leipzig’s Simons\nIt almost seems strange to be talking so much about Arsenal and their transfer ambitions because usually, they are quiet until making a sudden move to secure someone they have long been tracking. The latest name on the Emirates rumour machine is RB Leipzig’s forward Xavi Simons but they might be too late because Chelsea claim they have got him through the door at Stamford Bridge. Leipzig missed out on Champions League football for next season and face losing some of their best players.\nChelsea say they have signed him and he will likely be joined by Ajax defender, Jorrel Hato but they need to comply with their UEFA fine on spending going forward in order to play in the Champions League competition. That means selling players.\nChelsea were fined £17 million for failing to approach break-even financially and a further £9.5 million for spending more than the 80 per cent of its revenue on transfers and wages.\nThe situation is complicated and it will take a few days before everything becomes clear.\nLiverpool looking very strong next season\nLiverpool have confirmed to me that they expect to complete Coach Arne Slot’s wish to bring 23-year-old Hugo Ekitike to Anfield for £79 million after agreeing a deal with Eintracht Frankfurt.\nHis transfer fee will bring Liverpool’s summer spending to £270 million, but the Reds are still actively pursuing Crystal Palace captain, Marc Guehi, who they want to partner Virgil van Dijk in the heart of the backline.\nWhilst writing this, Ekitike will arrive at Anfield for a medical for his six-year-deal. The final giveaway sign that the Frenchman would be coming to Liverpool was Eintracht boss Dino Toppmoller, leaving him out of last Saturday’s defeat to FSV Frankfurt. Topmoller said, “He will be a bitter loss to this team.”\nA former Paris Saint-Germain striker, Ekitike hit 22 goals in 48 games last season and helped Frankfurt qualify for the Champions League. Liverpool had originally hoped to lure Alexander Isak away from Newcastle but that was always wishful thinking and Eddie Howe blocked that move with total commitment to his striker.\nGrealish trains alone until deal is done\nJack Grealish’s representatives are working hard behind the scenes to arrange a transfer for the Manchester City forward. Jack has been allowed to train alone at the Etihad facilities. He was left out of the City squad when they played in the Club Champions Cup competition and had little contact with either Pep Guardiola or his teammates during the past month.\nCity are prepared to take a substantial loss on the £100 million they originally paid for him in the summer of 2021. Several enquiries have been made by Premier League clubs and a couple from Europe, but all those have been a loan arrangement and City would prefer a sale.\nHis current salary of £300k a week is a stumbling block which only a few clubs could afford; therefore, a loan deal with City and sharing his salary is looking probable.\nWelcome back to the Premier League, Sunderland\nIt is wonderful to see Sunderland back in the big time – a club who throughout the history of football have played a huge part in our favourite game.\nThe Black Cats have started impressively with a 1-1 pre-season friendly draw at a Spanish club, Sevilla, who admittedly finished only 17th in La Liga last season but are still a formidable opponent.\nRegrettably, their speedy midfielder, Romaine Mundle was injured in pre-match training and had to undergo an operation at the weekend. Sunderland’s coach, Regis Le Bris, would not elaborate on Mundle’s injury but said it is hoped the 22-year-old would be training for the start of the season.\nUPDATE NEWS:\nNigerians can now invest ₦2.5 million on premium domains and profit about ₦17-₦25 million.
