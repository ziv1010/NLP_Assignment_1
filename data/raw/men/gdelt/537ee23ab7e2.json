  "body_text": "Arsenal’s Champions League match will go ahead tonight as planned - despite an alleged Islamic State security threat.\nThe quarter-final clash will take place at the Emirates Stadium as the Gunners host Bayern Munich tonight (April 9).\nIt comes after a pro-Islamic State media channel published multiple posters calling for attacks at stadiums hosting quarter-final ties on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nThis includes the Emirates Stadium in London and the Santiago Bernabeu - where Manchester City will take on Real Madrid.\nThe Metropolitan Police say they will have a robust policing plan in place for tonight’s game in London.\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan, who is overseeing the policing of London today, said: “We're aware of online and media reports in relation to calls to target matches across Europe and here in London.\n\"The UK terrorism threat level remains at ‘substantial’ meaning an attack is likely.\n\"We work closely with colleagues from across Counter Terrorism Policing in planning for events here in London, to take into account any relevant information that could help us to keep those attending safe.\"\nEuropean football’s governing body, UEFA, has since released a statement to say that it is aware of the alleged terrorist threats.\nIt added all matches are planned to go ahead as scheduled with appropriate security arrangements in place.\nIt explained: “UEFA is aware of alleged terrorist threats made towards this week’s UEFA Champions League matches and is closely liaising with the authorities at the respective venues.\n“All matches are planned to go ahead as scheduled with appropriate security arrangements in place.”\nFrance's interior ministry has confirmed an increased police presence will be in place in Paris on Wednesday where Paris St Germain will play Barcelona.\nPolice in Madrid have activated all of their 'alert' and 'response systems' following the supposed terrorist threat.\nCommissioner Adelekan added: \"I want to reassure the public that we have a robust policing plan in place for tonight's match and we continue to work closely alongside the club’s security team to ensure that the match passes peacefully.\n“As ever, we ask the public to remain vigilant, and if they see anything that doesn’t look or feel right, then report it to police or security staff.”",
