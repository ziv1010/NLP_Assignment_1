Indeed, he’s been impactful at each of his last three clubs.\nThe final season of his loan with Borussia Dortmund, 2019/20, saw him directly involved in 15 league goals, as well as four in the Champions League.\nThat led to a move to Inter Milan, where he scored seven goals and provided 10 assists in the league in one season. That was enough to gain him an immediate move to PSG, for in the region of £60million.\nIn 77 games for the Ligue 1 side so far, he’s scored eight goals and provided 11 assists.\nIt’s little surprise, then, that he’s being courted yet again. Indeed, Chelsea and Manchester United are reportedly both keen on the Morocco international.\nIt seems the former will soon appoint Mauricio Pochettino as manager. That the Argentine managed Hakimi at PSG is one of the reasons Chelsea are so keen on him.\nTEAMtalk recently revealed PSG will let the wing-back move on ‘if they receive a suitable offer’. Hakimi is one of a few star players they’ll listen to offers for, as part of a new strategy.\nChelsea learn Hakimi asking price\nAn update has since reinforced PSG’s decision to allow Hakimi to leave, including information on what they’d accept for him.\nFootball Insider reports the Ligue 1 side have ‘placed a £50-60million price tag’ on the wing-back.\nThe report adds PSG feel that to be ‘reasonable’ taking into account the £60million they paid for him. That he’s continued his stellar form since his move and is under contract until 2026 means that is certainly true.\nWhat’s more, the report suggests the club will ‘stand firm’ in their valuation due to the length of Hakimi’s deal. Should they not receive a suitable offer, it’s not as if his value will suddenly dwindle.\nHakimi snare simple task for Chelsea\nGiven the financial might the Blues possess, snaring Hakimi should not be hard. While Man Utd might be in the mix, they’re likely to prioritise a striker signing, so won’t have their full attention on the deal.\nChelsea might be in the clear if that’s to happen, and things could fall into place for them even more soon.\nThe potential departure of Reece James, while a big loss, would actually help the Blues in a way. Having both Hakimi and James in a team seems somewhat pointless, given they operate in the same position.\nHowever, reports have suggested James could be the subject of a move to Real Madrid. One outlet stated that would cost the La Liga side £90million.\nThat’s more than what the Blues would need to pay for Hakimi, so they’d be in the black. What’s more, they can’t be in too good a position where Financial FairPlay regulations are concerned, so a big outbound transfer and a smaller inbound one seems smart.\nChelsea will be in good nick on the pitch too – there doesn’t seem a much better replacement for James than Hakimi.",
