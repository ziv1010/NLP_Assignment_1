It was rejected by the Dutch side, but sources confirm Fulham have not given up.\nWe are told Pepi, who has 10 goals and two assists to his name this season, is keen to move to England, and Fulham does appeal.\nHowever, whilst Fulham have launched their bid, others are showing interest, including Everton, Sunderland, Leeds and West Ham.\nAnd whilst Fulham continue talks over Pepi, they have also pushed on with their interest in Sterling…\nWant more breaking transfer lines from original sources?
