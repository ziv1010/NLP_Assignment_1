Mohamed Salah has been Liverpool’s top scorer in each of the last eight seasons but barring an unlikely chain of events, Ekitike will break that sequence. The baton has been passed on.\nSaturday’s stirring 4-1 victory against Newcastle ended a damaging five-game winless streak in the Premier League, easing the pressure on Slot and reigniting Liverpool’s push for Champions League qualification.\nIbrahima Konate deserved all the plaudits that came his way on an emotional night. The centre-back capped an outstanding defensive display with the fourth goal late on before being mobbed by team-mates. “It was written in the stars,” captain Virgil van Dijk told reporters, referring to Konate’s recent return from compassionate leave following the death of his father.\nCollectively, there was an impressive response after Anthony Gordon’s drilled finish in front of the Kop broke the deadlock. It was the first time Liverpool had won a league fixture after going behind since they hammered Tottenham Hotspur 5-1 to wrap up the title in April.\nHowever, it was Ekitike who did more than anyone to transform the mood, striking twice in as many minutes just before the break. His name boomed around Anfield.\n“He’s funny, happy, always brings a nice energy to the training ground, but also to the stadium because the fans love him as well,” Slot told reporters.\nAdvertisement\n“From the start, everybody could see how special he is, how fast he is. That was probably best seen with the second goal he scored. He took a one-v-one on, went on the outside, which is very difficult in modern football, as usually players go to the inside and have a shot with the right. But there you can see his pace.\n“His biggest improvement is his work rate off the ball and that is so helpful and necessary for a team that wants to press throughout 95 minutes.”\nThe comparisons with former Liverpool striker Fernando Torres are inevitable. Ekitike’s second goal was reminiscent of how the Spanish centre-forward announced himself to Anfield on his home debut against Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea in August 2007.\nOn that occasion, Torres latched on to a pass from Steven Gerrard, sped away from defender Tal Ben Haim and then opened up his body to find the far corner.\nEkitike occupied the same left channel on Saturday after being picked out by the quick thinking of Milos Kerkez. He was too quick, too powerful for Malick Thiaw and sent a similarly clinical finish past Nick Pope.\n“It is Torres-like. He reminds me of Torres every time I watch him,” said Gerrard in his role as a pundit for TNT Sports.\nDuring his post-match interview with the UK broadcaster, Ekitike admitted he had only seen clips of Torres’ Liverpool career on YouTube as his mum could not afford the subscription to watch Premier League football when he was growing up in the French city of Reims.\n“He was a really good player. If I can reach his level and be even better, it would be great, but I have to keep working,” Ekitike said.\n“I want to score a lot of goals. I’d like to be the top scorer of the club. I just want to be involved in helping the team to win. Tonight was about the team spirit. We won 4-1 and everyone ran everywhere for the team. It’s not about who was on the scoresheet.”\nThere have been too many false dawns in a season dogged by inconsistency for anyone to get carried away with Saturday’s triumph. Standards have to be maintained when Manchester City visit Anfield next Sunday.\nAdvertisement\nBut the sight of the double act between Ekitike and Florian Wirtz flourishing has to bode well for Liverpool’s chances of salvaging something significant from this turbulent campaign.\nWhen Wirtz burst past two defenders and cut the ball back to the near post, Ekitike was there to ram home the equaliser. They have assisted each other six times in all competitions this season (three each). No Premier League duo can match that tally. It’s the most by two Liverpool players in their debut season since John Barnes and Ray Houghton in 1987-88 (also six).\n“The more players play together, the more they can find an understanding,” Slot said.\n“I’ve tried to explain why it was difficult for them to play every three days earlier in the season. Now they can do that because they can keep going. They can play more often together.\n“We can play more often with the same combinations and, as last season showed, the more you can play together, the better it is. The connections are getting better and better.”\nEkitike and Wirtz, who have struck up a bond off the pitch, found the physicality and intensity of Premier League football a culture shock. They tended to fade in games and cramp up, but now they possess greater endurance to handle the demands.\nWirtz, who has six goals and three assists in his last 11 appearances, wrapped up the points when he swept home Salah’s pass. The classy Germany international has silenced the critics who questioned the wisdom of Liverpool’s £116m investment.\n“I am very happy,” Wirtz told TNT Sports. “I love to score, assist and help the team to win. I want to continue like that. It gives you more confidence. Hugo is unbelievable. You see him again today, two fantastic goals. It’s fun to play with him on the pitch.”\n“Champions” was the chant around a jubilant Anfield deep into stoppage time. Liverpool haven’t looked like it for most of this season, but the past week has provided a timely reminder of the heights they are capable of reaching.",
