There will however be no travelling Bayern Munich supporters in attendance due to a UEFA ban.\nMeanwhile, Manchester City are in Madrid for their first-leg tie against Spanish giants Real Madrid. According to reports in Spain authorities are on \"alert\" and \"response systems\" are in place.\nThe Spanish capital is hosting two knock-out games in consecutive days. After City's tie with Real, Atlético de Madrid take on German side Borussia Dortmund the following evening.\nEuropean football's governing body UEFA said of the threats: \"UEFA is aware of alleged terrorist threats made towards this week's UEFA Champions League matches & is closely liaising with the authorities at the respective venues.All matches are planned to go ahead as scheduled with appropriate security arrangements in place.\"\nDon't miss: Putin claimed US terror warnings before ISIS Moscow massacre were 'blackmail'\nDon't miss: ISIS attack attempt on US 'inevitable' as top retired general issues warning\nDon't miss: Russia ‘too depleted’ to retaliate against ISIS-K after horror Moscow attack\nThe Met's Deputy Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan, overseeing the policing of London today, told Express.co.uk: “The UK terrorism threat level remains at ‘substantial’ meaning an attack is likely, and we work closely with colleagues from across Counter Terrorism Policing in planning for events here in London, to take into account any relevant information that could help us to keep those attending safe.\n\"We're aware of online and media reports in relation to calls to target matches across Europe and here in London. However, I want to reassure the public that we have a robust policing plan in place for tonight's match and we continue to work closely alongside the club’s security team to ensure that the match passes peacefully.\n“As ever, we ask the public to remain vigilant, and if they see any that doesn’t look or feel right, then report it to police or security staff.”",
