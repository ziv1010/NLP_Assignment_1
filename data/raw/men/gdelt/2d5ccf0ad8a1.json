We are Liverpool and qualifying to the competition is the bare minimum. I am sorry but it’s too soon for an uplifting or optimistic post. We let you and ourselves down.\"\nLISTEN NOW\nOn this week's edition of Talking Transfers, part of the 90min podcast network, Scott Saunders is joined by Toby Cudworth and Graeme Bailey to discuss all the latest transfer news. On the agenda: Tottenham's pursuit of Feyenoord manager Arne Slot, Bayern Munich's interest in Declan Rice, Joshua Kimmich, Neymar & more!\nIf you can't see this embed, click here to listen to the podcast!\nAsked about Salah's message during Friday's press conference, Klopp was keen to play down the drama and insisted the Egyptian was right to be disappointed.\n\"I am just worried about the headlines you create,\" Klopp said.\"It's a fact we don't have Champions League, even I knew after last game, clear. I drew a line underneath it. I am optimistic but in that moment I couldn't see it.\n\"It's completely normal. This wasn't an historically good season. We made mistakes. I saw Mo an hour ago in the canteen and he was smiling. He wasn't in a bad mood.\"\nLiverpool close their season out against bottom-side Southampton on Sunday with nothing to play for, having already confirmed fifth place in the Premier League table.",
