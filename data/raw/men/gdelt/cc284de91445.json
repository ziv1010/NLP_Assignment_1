  "body_text": "FOOTBALL – Bahrain clubs Muharraq and Al Khaldiya kick off their respective campaigns tonight in the 2025-26 AFC Champions League (ACL) Two.\nDefending Nasser Bin Hamad Bahrain Premier Football League champions Muharraq are at home against Al Wehdat of Jordan in their opening Group A clash, scheduled for a 9.15pm kick-off at the Late Shaikh Ali Bin Mohammed Bin Isa Al Khalifa Stadium in Arad.\nKhaldiya, on the other hand, are away to Al Ahli SC of Qatar. The holders of the His Majesty the King’s Cup are set to take the field at Al Thumama Stadium in Doha in their Group B game slated for a 7pm start, Bahrain time.\nThe ACL Two is the second-tier club championship of the AFC – one level below the AFC Champions League Elite and one above the AFC Challenge League.\nMuharraq and Khaldiya are amongst a 32-strong cast representing 22 member associations from across the continent who are playing in a home-and-away round-robin format.\nMuharraq are participating in the ACL Two in its new form for the first time, although they have won the competition twice in the past in 2008 and 2021 when it was still known as the AFC Cup. Khaldiya, on the other hand, are returning for a second straight season.\n“This is a big competition,” said Muharraq’s Portuguese head coach Fernando Manuel de Jesus Santos last night during his pre-game Press conference.\n“We are prepared to face this tournament with a lot of hope to do a good image and play good football. That’s what we want for the game tomorrow.\n“We are prepared for a tough game, but with the illusion to win and take the three points.”\nThe other teams in Group A are Al Wasl FC of the UAE and Esteghlal FC of Iran, who face off this evening at Zabeel Stadium in Dubai at 7pm, Bahrain.\nGroup B also features FC Arkadag of Turkmenistan and PFC Andijon of Uzbekistan, who play at Arkadag Stadium at 4.45pm, Bahrain time.\nSpeaking in Khaldiya’s pre-match Press conference yesterday, head coach Ali Ashoor said through an interpreter that his team is happy to be playing in this season’s ACL Two. Ashoor added that they will try their best to have a good start in the competition, acknowledging that Qatar’s Ahli are a good team.\nKhaldiya and Bahrain international defender Ahmed Bughammar added that their players are determined to have a positive result in tonight’s game. He added that Khaldiya are hoping to improve on their finish from last season’s ACL Two, where they reached the last 16.\nMuharraq and Khaldiya are both competing as part of the ACL Two’s West Asia region, which also features Foolad Mobarakeh Sepahan SC of Iran, Al Hussein of Jordan, Mohun Bagan Super Giant of India, and Ahal FC of Turkmenistan in Group C; and Al Nassr Club of Saudi Arabia, Al Zawraa SC of Iraq, FC Istiklol of Tajikistan, and FC Goa of India in Group D.\nGroups E to H feature four East Asian clubs apiece. They are from China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, South Korea, the Philippines, and Australia.\nThe ACL Two group stage is scheduled to continue until December 24 before moving into the round of 16 between February 10 and 19 in 2026.\nThe quarter-finals and semis will then be held in March and April, respectively, with the final pencilled in for May 16.\npatrick@gdnmedia.bh",
