  "body_text": "Arne Slot may have won the Premier League with Liverpool last season but pressure is growing on the Reds boss after their latest defeat.\nThe champions were beaten 3-2 at Bournemouth on Saturday evening, recovering from 2-0 behind to equalise, only to lose the game in stoppage time.\nIt was Liverpool’s seventh Premier League defeat of the season, having only lost four times on their way to the title last campaign.\nWhile a title challenge appears to be over, it is not a disastrous season just yet, with the Reds sitting fourth in both the Premier League and Champions League tables, while they are also still alive in the FA Cup.\nHowever, Slot will be feeling the heat as the defence of their title has been extremely underwhelming despite spending a huge amount of money in the summer on the likes of Alexander Isak, Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez.\nThe Dutchman does not appear likely to lose his job imminently, but attention, in some quarters, has turned to who could replace him in the Anfield hotseat.\nEspecially as a Liverpool favourite, who has built an impressive reputation in management, has recently become unemployed.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?
