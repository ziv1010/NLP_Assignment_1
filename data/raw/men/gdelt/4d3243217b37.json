We are choosing both competitions strongly because we have two ways for our positive season to end.”\nThe FA Cup represents a realistic chance for Emery’s first trophy in English football and victory will send Villa through to their first FA Cup final since 2015.\nBut the Spaniard says the journey is more important than the destination.\n“As a coach my challenge when I arrived here was to get some trophies along the way,” he said.\n“We have an opportunity because we are in the semi-final, but there is a lot of work to do.\n“When you are getting experiences and getting trophies, the most important thing I learned and I enjoyed, was the way and not the end.\n“And how we are doing this year in the FA Cup is amazing, this is the process I want to enjoy.\n“I want to enjoy the semi-final about everything we are going to do. Travelling to London, being together, preparing the match, meeting tomorrow morning, the atmosphere in Wembley.\nThe #EmiratesFACup semi-final schedule has been confirmed! 📺\n— Emirates FA Cup (@EmiratesFACup) April 4, 2025\n“The objective is to win, but the process is really important.”\nEmery’s only previous visit to Wembley as a manager was when he was at Arsenal, playing against Tottenham in a league match while Spurs’ new stadium was being built.\nAsked what it meant to him, he replied: “Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy, enjoy. I am a coach. I love my profession, my work and to smell good stadium, good pitches.\n“I like it, and tomorrow I will enjoy it. Of course, I have a huge responsibility to try to respond in good way with the players.\n“But I’m so excited playing matches like tomorrow, and the possibility we will have.”\nVilla are at full strength for the match against Palace, which will see Ollie Watkins and Marcus Rashford battle it out for a place in attack.",
