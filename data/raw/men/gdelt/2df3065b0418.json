The journey can be a long wait at the original club or a multi-stop journey throughout the first decade of a career in search of an opportunity. Through multiple moves, William Popp (ポープ・ウィリアム) continued pushing for minutes while carving out a solid career in Japan. The 29-year-old, now with Yokohama F. Marinos, is in position to claim the Asian Football Confederation’s Champions League title, with his performances leading the way through the knockout rounds.\nSSFC Spotlight: William Popp leads Yokohama F. Marinos to AFC Champions League final\nThe American-Japanese goalkeeper is hitting new heights.\nBorn in the Tokyo Prefecture city of Hino to a Japanese mother and an American father, Popp played with Owada Soccer Club, becoming a goalkeeper when a broken ankle limited his mobility — the position switch became permanent after starring at the Hachioji New Year Futsal Tournament. Scouted by Tokyo Verdy (admitted into the club in part due to his mother’s height), his youth career overcame a delayed start compared to his peers and progressed upward through the age levels, including winning the prestigious Prince Takamado Trophy. He then joined the senior squad in 2013 and was marked as a top prospect but made a single J2 League appearance while also competing with a combined J-League Under-22 side in the third tier. Following the extension of his contract and an injury struggle, the club sent him out on two loans, to FC Gifu and Kawasaki Frontale, appearing five times for the former side while making the bench twice and dealing with an injury at the latter in the midst of a title-winning campaign.\nAfter 5 professional seasons and 11 total years on the books at Verdy, Popp stayed at Kawasaki Frontale on a permanent contract, a bittersweet move. “I couldn’t sleep the day I decided to leave Verdy,” said the goalkeeper. “I felt much more sad and lonely about leaving Verdy than I was happy to be competing as a member of Kawasaki Frontale, one of Japan’s top teams. I made the transfer at a time when I hadn’t achieved anything yet, and I hadn’t contributed anything to Verdy either. However, I loved Verdy more than anyone else, and I wanted to do it for Verdy... I will always be a Verdy supporter, and I am someone who grew up with green blood.”\nAfter taking a back-up role in his first season following the transfer (another J1 League title-winning campaign) and improving his physical strength and stability on crosses, Popp went on loan to Oita Trinita in 2019, making six combined appearances in the Emperor’s Cup and the J. League Cup. In the successive year, he went on loan again, this time moving to Fagiano Okayama in the J2 League. Earning the first regular playing time of his career, the club featured him in 40 matches while registering 10 shutouts, which allowed for him to grow and endure the typical struggles that come from lack of experience.\nDeparting Kawasaki Frontale, Popp returned to Oita Trinita on a permanent deal, believing the club would provide him with “the toughest practice in Japan.” In his sole season with Azūro (Azzurro) the goalkeeper played in 19 total matches but lost his starting gig for the second half of the year as the club was relegated from the J1 League. However, he continued to grow as a player, working on his positioning and correcting other issues.\nHis professional odyssey continued, landing with Machida Zelvia in the J2 League. After beginning the 2022 season as a backup, Popp became the starter for 15 fixtures before heading back to the bench. Following a contract renewal, he began the following year as the starter and made 31 appearances with 11 shutouts. The manager demoted him to the number-two role in August, but his play was cited as a key reason as to why the club earned promotion and finished atop the table by a 12-point margin.\nIn January, Popp joined J1 League side Yokohama F. Marinos with the expectation of replacing past starter Jun Ichimori. He is enjoying “immeasurable growth” in the club’s vertical playing style that requires “good foot skills to set up attacks and take care of the vast space behind the defense that maintains a high line.” The new signing immediately stepped into the number-one role and has featured in eight out of nine possible domestic matches, missing a single fixture due to a red card.\nHe joined a squad in the midst of a deep AFC Champions League campaign and has appeared in all six knockout phase battles, leading the Tricolor to face United Arab Emirates side Al Ain in the final. Popp’s performance in the semifinal round against Ulsan HD drew rave reviews. The 1-0 defeat in the first leg featured “a series of fine saves.” The second was a cinematic shootout triumph in the driving rain; the goalkeeper powered through cramping issues, relying on gut instinct over the scouting data to stop the crucial spot kick.\nNow at a veteran stage of his career and in a suitable playing style, Popp seems to have reached a higher ground at a club with a focus on winning. “At the end of last year, I was on the bench in J2,” he reflected after the semifinal victory. “There were some tough times, but if you believe in yourself and keep going, the path will open up more and more. With a strong will, you can forge your own path. It’s the life of a soccer player... I’ve been working hard, and I’m deeply moved by the fact that all of that has led me to this stage. Even during today’s penalty shootout, I was able to take that penalty while thinking back on a lot of things. Some of it was frustrating, some was about me overcoming difficult times, and those things really gave me strength. I’m glad I worked hard until then.”\nAt the international level, Popp made a few appearances for Japan’s youth sides. He was described as a “hero” for the U-19 team after securing a first-place finish at the 2012 SBS Cup and was included with the U-20 squad at the East Asian Games. The program named him as a late call-up to the U-21 side that competed at the 2014 Asian Games (describing the quarterfinal finish as a “good experience”) along with keeping him in the mix with the U-22 group during the ensuing Olympic qualifying.\nStanding over 6’3” and with “long limbs and skillful footwork,” Popp is an active presence in the box with “outstanding” shot-stopping and quick reactions, a product of his springy athleticism. One of the J1 League’s top shot-stoppers, he is a constant operator in the build-up with “above-average technique” and accurate long-range distribution, willing to leave his area all the way to the center circle and drill line-splitting passes while under pressure. His work on crosses is proactive, although there is a penchant for deflecting away the ball instead of catching. His best quality is perhaps the ability to make adjustments and improvise on breakaways and close-range opportunities, reestablishing his positioning or flailing the necessary limb in order to force a stop.\nUnless an unexpected change is made by the manager, Popp will be an American goalkeeper featuring in a Champions League final, which is quite the change of fortune for a player who was on the trajectory of a journeyman and failed to win his first professional match until the age of 25. As an academy prospect, he was viewed as possessing the talent to be a starter in Japan’s top division, but competition for the limited opportunities at his position is fierce. His career may have finally turned a corner and a continental club title would cement his ascension and perhaps lead to some interest at the international level.",
