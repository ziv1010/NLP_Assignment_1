  "body_text": "Manchester United are progressing with a potential loan move for Burnley striker Wout Weghorst, who is currently on loan with Turkish side Besiktas.\nThe Reds are looking to recruit a new striker this month following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo in November, with Erik ten Hag keen to add cover for Anthony Martial. The Frenchman has been impressive this term and registered seven goal contributions, but he has already missed 15 matches through injury.\nThe Manchester Evening News understands that United are keen on a move for Netherlands forward Weghorst. The 30-year-old has scored eight goals in 16 games for his loan club this term and is aligned with Ten Hag's transfer strategy of favouring players familiar to him or schooled in his homeland.\nMeanwhile, reports are suggesting that Atletico Madrid are demanding a £9.5million loan fee and a commitment to buy at £70.5m for Joao Felix in January. The Portugal international has fallen out with manager Diego Simeone and the club are happy for him to leave this month. The Reds are thought to be keen on the player, but are unlikely to pay a substantial loan fee for any attacker.\nTODAY'S BIG TALKING POINT: Would Weghorst be a good signing?

I looked at the culture of the club. I asked: 'How did Manchester United become great?’ The club has bought an unimaginable number of players in recent years who have not been good enough. Most purchases have been average - and at United average is not good enough. United's shirt weighs heavily. Only real personalities, who can perform under great pressure, can play here.\"",
