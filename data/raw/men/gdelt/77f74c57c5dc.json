  "body_text": "Newcastle United v PSG at St James’ Park first Champions League game? I would love it!\nIn just 18 days time we could be watching Newcastle United v PSG at St James’ Park.\nThe first of the six NUFC Champions League group matches to be played on either 19 or 20 September.\nWe will find out by Saturday morning at the latest just what order and where we will be playing PSG, Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan, but I REALLY hope it is Newcastle United v PSG first up.\nFor those watching the Champions League group draw, the moment when Newcastle United were drawn out of the hat was quite something.\nIt was always going to be special for Newcastle United fans, whoever we were matched up with, but it was THE moment of the entire draw.\nThe whole room of gathered dignitaries appeared to take a huge collective intake of breath when Newcastle United were added to PSG, Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan, very audible gasps of shock / delight clearly coming across on our laptops and phones as we watched the draw live.\nThis is surely what we all wanted, isn’t it?\nA very big statement, Newcastle United are now back and competing!\nIt isn’t arrogance, it is just stating fact.\nNobody in that room last night thinks Newcastle United are a joke anymore, quite the opposite.\nInstead, they think Newcastle United are serious contenders. The bookies make Eddie Howe’s side eighth in the betting to win the whole thing and are favourites along with PSG to progress from the group.\nNobody, including / especially Newcastle United fans, are claiming success is a certainty, instead it is the case that we just think we can be competitive and if things fall right, NUFC can progress from this proverbial group of death.\nI see some Newcastle supporters reacting negatively to the draw.\nI can’t quite get my head around when after waiting two decades for another go at the Champions League I am seeing some NUFC fans crying on because we didn’t get Dynamo Sunderland or Red Star Wigan in our group.\nTwo of the biggest moments in Newcastle United Champions League history saw us up against unfancied opposition in Croatia Zagreb and Partizan Belgrade, we scraped through against one and in the other they are still looking for the ball after Alan Shearer blazed his penalty over the bar at the Gallowgate End in that horrific shootout 20 years ago.\nTwenty years and four days later, after that Partizan Belgrade nightmare, we get a dream group against PSG, Dortmund and AC Milan.\nIt really is the perfect group in so many ways.\nWho is everybody talking about after the Champions League draw…\nMan City, Man Utd and Arsenal barely getting a mention!\nIt is Newcastle United making all the headlines.\nThe Newcastle United owners certainly will be absolutely loving this, they want our club to be massive and known by everybody around the world.\nThere are no guarantees on winning any match, as we discovered to our cost in the final ten minutes last weekend.\nHowever, football is all about creating memorable moments.\nYes, our enemies never cease to remind us about the lack of modern day silverware but so what, none of us started supporting Newcastle United because of trophies.\nWe love brilliant games, brilliant moments and if a trophy is the eventual outcome then it’s a bonus.\nI was lucky enough to be there when we beat Juventus, Feyenoord, Barcelona and others, back in the day.\nTime now for us to watch more memorable moments.\nI think it will be perfect if it is Newcastle United v PSG at St James’ Park in 18 or 19 days time, the chance to really get into this from the very first whistle.\nNewcastle United are back and now just a case of players and fans giving their all at every match.\nThe very fact that it appears to be such a tough group, immediately lifts so much pressure and expectation from Newcastle United.\nWe just need to give it our best shot and if Newcastle United progress through this group, it will be talked about for many years. Plus, what massive confidence if they do go through, as the knockout opposition can’t be much tougher than this lot.\nChampions League group stage draw – 31 August 2023\nGROUP A\nBayern Munich, Man Utd, FC Copenhagen, Galatasaray\nGROUP B\nSevilla, Arsenal, PSV, Lens\nGROUP C\nNapoli, Real Madrid, Sporting Braga, Union Berlin\nGROUP D\nBenfica, Inter Milan, FC Salzburg, Real Sociedad\nGROUP E\nFeyenoord, Atletico Madrid, Lazio, Celtic\nGROUP F\nPSG, Borussia Dortmund, AC Milan, Newcastle United\nGROUP G\nMan City, RB Leipzig, Red Star Belgrade, Young Boys\nGROUP H\nBarcelona, Porto, Shakhtar Dontesk, Royal Antwerp\nDuring the Champions League group draw, fans informed that by Saturday morning at the latest we will find out which matches will be played when.\nThe dates of the 2023/24 Champions League draws\nGroup stage: 31 August 2023\nRound of 16: 18 December 2023\nQuarter-finals & semi-finals: 15 March 2024\nThe dates of the 2023/24 Champions League group stage matches\nMatchday 1: 19/20 September 2023\nMatchday 2: 3/4 October 2023\nMatchday 3: 24/25 October 2023\nMatchday 4: 7/8 November 2023\nMatchday 5: 28/29 November 2023\nMatchday 6: 12/13 December 2023\nThe dates of the 2023/24 knockout stages of the Champions League:\nRound of 16: 13/14/20/21 February and 5/6/12/13 March 2024\nQuarter-finals: 9/10 and 16/17 April 2024\nSemi-finals: 30 April/1 May and 7/8 May 2024\nFinal: 1 June 2024\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
