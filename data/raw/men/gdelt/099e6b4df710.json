We won 2-0 in the reverse fixture back in October thanks to Frida Maanum's dribble and dink, and a beautiful strike from Lia Walti.\nWe kick off at 7:15pm UK time, so join us on Arsenal.com for live footage and commentary of the game. Nicole Holliday and Adrian Clarke will also be in the studio for a special Breakdown Live from 7pm onwards.\nIf watching on the app, please ensure you've updated to the latest version - iOS / Android\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
