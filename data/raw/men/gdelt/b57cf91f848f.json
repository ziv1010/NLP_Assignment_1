Azam died on Monday, the welfare group confirmed. The parents and Izza are the only survivors of the accident.\nThe principal of Arab Unity School, where they were enrolled as pupils, paid tribute to the boys.\n\"We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss experienced by one of our school families,\" said Mark Pollitt.\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with the family during this unimaginable time, and we stand with them in solidarity as a school community.\"\nEach of the boys was cherished in different ways at the school, he added.\n\"Ashaz, a Year 10 student, was known for his quiet determination and strong sense of responsibility,\" he said. \"He approached his studies seriously and earned the respect of staff and peers through his conduct and consistency.\n\"He found joy in football, where his discipline, teamwork and commitment were evident, and he was regarded as a dependable and thoughtful presence both in and beyond the classroom.\"\nAmmar, in Year 9, was outgoing, friendly, and naturally inclusive, forming strong relationships with both classmates and teachers, said Mr Pollitt.\n\"Ammar engaged positively with school life and showed perseverance in his learning. His openness, kindness and enthusiasm left a lasting impression on those around him.\"\nAyash, in Foundation Stage, loved listening to stories and was eager to share ideas and questions.\n\"His sense of humour, creativity, and love for art brought colour to the classroom,\" Mr Pollitt said. \"Ayash spoke often about wanting to become a firefighter and recently took great pride in performing with his classmates in the school’s annual concert.\"\nThe four boys will be buried in the UAE in accordance with the family’s wishes. The body of the family's maid, who was 48, will be sent home to her family in Kerala.\n“If you lose children at one time, what can you do? It’s just too difficult. We can only pray,” a family friend, who volunteers with the Kerala Muslim Cultural Centre supporting the family, told The National.",
