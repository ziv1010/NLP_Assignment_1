And just hours after those revelations, Frank’s departure was confirmed – but the truth is the decision was effectively made before the final whistle on Tuesday.\nWe are told the decisive push came from CEO Vinai Venkatesham, who held lengthy discussions with executive chairman Peter Charrington as the first half unfolded.\nWith tensions already running high behind the scenes, the dismal showing against Newcastle served as the final trigger. The Lewis family were contacted overnight and wasted little time endorsing the decision to remove Frank.\nAnd we also understand that some changes within the club’s hierarchy could be on the way, with several roles and reporting lines expected to be reviewed as part of a wider reset following Frank’s dismissal.\nA host of names have already been floated in immediate internal conversations, but we can confirm that Mauricio Pochettino remains highly regarded by Tottenham’s hierarchy, as we exclusively revealed on January 13.\nThere is genuine belief at senior level that a return for the Argentine is very much in the club’s thinking. Some in Spurs’ hierarchy believe he could restore identity, energy and unity at a time when all three are in desperately short supply. His return is considered a real possibility and has significant support internally.\nAnother major contender is Roberto De Zerbi, as we also exclusively revealed, back on January 7. Tottenham’s admiration for the Italian is genuine, and sources close to him have confirmed he would welcome the opportunity to speak to Spurs if an official approach is made. His bold attacking style and proven ability to elevate young talent make him an appealing fit for the club’s vision going forward.\nTottenham are insisting privately that they will undertake a thorough and disciplined process. Andoni Iraola and Oliver Glasner have both been discussed as tactical fits who align with the club’s preferred profile, particularly with their structured, high‑energy approaches. Both men are regarded as credible candidates should talks with the more high‑profile names prove complex or unsuccessful, though another shock contender has emerged…\nWant more breaking transfer lines from original sources?

Some senior figures believe the former England manager’s leadership, calmness and player‑management skills could steady a fractious dressing room.\nWhether Southgate would be open to the role remains uncertain, but his name has been raised in internal conversations.\nTwo heavyweight figures have also been mentioned: Julian Nagelsmann and Thomas Tuchel, both preparing for the upcoming World Cup finals with Germany and England respectively.\nWhile admired for their tactical pedigree and elite‑level experience, landing either is considered highly ambitious at this stage, with a lack of Champions League football on-offer to try and entice them.\nWednesday’s dramatic events underline just how unstable this era has become at Tottenham. Frank arrived as a figure intended to bring long‑term clarity and calm, yet his tenure unravelled rapidly amid poor results and internal tension.\nThe club now stands at a crucial crossroads. With fan frustration rising and Spurs drifting in both identity and results, this next appointment will define the club’s direction for years to come.\nWhat is clear is that Tottenham are moving fast, speaking to agents, analysing profiles and debating strategy behind the scenes. The powerbrokers – Vinai Venkatesham and the Lewis family – are under intense scrutiny, with supporters eager for decisive leadership and a manager capable of re‑energising the entire club.\nLatest Tottenham news: De Zerbi ready to join / Robbie Keane tipped\nMeanwhile, reports have backed up our information that De Zerbi is ready to become Tottenham’s new manager, with the Italian open to taking the role now that Daniel Levy and Fabio Paratici have left the club.\nTalkSPORT journalist Alex Crook has reported that Tottenham are keen on De Zerbi, and believes that it wasn’t a coincidence he left Marseille overnight.\nIn other news, Michael Dawson has urged Spurs to bring in ex-Tottenham striker Robbie Keane as their interim manager until the end of the season.\nAnd in that same report, we not how another former Tottenham centre-back, Ramon Vega, has called for Spurs CEO Venkatesham and sporting director Johan Lange to be relieved of their duties.\nGet the inside story first by joining our TEAMtalk Facebook channel to receive the latest breaking and exclusive news straight into your Messenger inbox.",
