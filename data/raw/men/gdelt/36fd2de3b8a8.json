The traditional Nike swoosh has been turned vertical in both pink and yellow.\nFans already got a glimpse of the new kit during the women's side's pre-season victory over Arsenal, with this third strip also drawing inspiration from the rapid rise of women's football.\nThe women's side wore shirts which still featured the Infinite Athlete branding on the front. The company has an agreement to remain as the front-of-shirt sponsors for pre-season but, as has already been the case with the men's team, it will be removed when Sonia Bompastor's side enter competitive action.\nChelsea are once again on the hunt for a new sponsor, having now entered a second consecutive campaign playing with blank shirts.\nReports suggest the Blues are looking for a one-year deal like the one they reached with Infinite Athlete as club officials believe they will be able to sell the club's branding for a higher fee if they can qualify for the Champions League this season.\nCompanies from Saudi Arabia are believed to have been contacted but, as of yet, Chelsea have not found an agreement.",
