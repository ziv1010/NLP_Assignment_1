If you had said to me when he left Lyon that we would meet again in the last 16 of the World Cup, especially with him in charge of Morocco, I would not have believed it.\n\"He knows the France team inside out, with the players he coached at Lyon and those he came up against.\"\nPedros also won consecutive French domestic crowns and a French Cup when in charge of Lyon.\nLe Sommer added: \"He did great things with us, winning titles. It was by no means insignificant.\"\n'Winning mentality'\nPedros, who won a French title as a player with Nantes in 1995 and helped them reach the Champions League semi-finals the following year, began working with the Moroccan football federation in late 2020.\nHe has helped oversee the development of women's football in the country and took the team to the final of the Africa Cup of Nations on home soil last year, via which they qualified for the World Cup.\n\"He has brought great experience, stability and a winning mentality,\" Nassim El Kerf, a journalist with the Moroccan news website Le Desk, told AFP.\n“He has been a key figure in the development strategy for women's football in Morocco and has made himself popular thanks to his results.\"\nVictories against South Korea and Colombia, after a 6-0 hammering by Germany in their opening game, have seen Morocco make history at the tournament -– no Arab team had won a Women's World Cup match before.\nBut beating France -- whose own coach Herve Renard spent three years in charge of the Moroccan men's team between 2016 and 2019 –- would be a remarkable achievement for the side ranked 72nd in the world.\n\"We are going to try and cause them a few problems,\" Pedros said.\n\"It has been an incredible World Cup, full of surprises. That is the magic of sport at the highest level. You never know what is going to happen.\"\n© 2023 AFP",
