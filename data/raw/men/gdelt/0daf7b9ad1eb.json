  "body_text": "Leeds 2-0 West Ham\nUnless you watched Monday’s game, it’s hard to believe how one-sided that was. If Brentford are rocking up at your house and outplaying you, you know you’re in trouble.\nOnly losing 2-0 flattered the Hammers. Seriously, they were that bad, it was surreal to witness. Leeds might never get a better chance for a rare victory. Friday is too quick a turnaround for the Irons to have improved that dramatically.\nChelsea 3-0 Sunderland\nI have long argued that Chelsea remind me of Arteta’s Arsenal in his first few years as a manager.\nA young team, always learning, who will have moments of inconsistency because of their youth.\nThe Blues have scored ten goals in their last three games, including beating the Champions, so confidence is high at the Bridge. The earlier the breakthrough, the more straightforward the afternoon.\nNewcastle 1-0 Fulham\nI was surprised Fulham were as timid as they were against Arsenal last Saturday, and I’m interested to see how they approach this weekend.\nI think the Toon will just have enough quality in the final third to make a difference.\nThe likes of Anthony Gordon are finding their mojo, and they should be able to carry over their momentum from the Champions League.\nCan Arsenal Stay Grounded?\nMan United 2-2 Brighton\nWhether you think he’s capable of succeeding at Man United or not, it was hard not to feel happy for Ruben Amorim last weekend.\nThere’s a good chance the 40-year-old took on the job too early and, in his private moments, probably regrets ever leaving Lisbon.\nYet he’s always been honest about his struggles.\nThat victory at Anfield means that, for the first time in a while, fans will show up at Old Trafford in a positive mood. It’s one thing being motivated against Liverpool, but their players need to have that attitude consistently.\nIt took over a year to earn back-to-back league victories. Suddenly, a hat-trick of Premier League wins is asking a bit much.\nBrentford 1-2 Liverpool\nLiverpool have struggled to defend set pieces this season. The way Brentford threatened at the London Stadium with their variation of corners and long throws will give them confidence they can cause the Champions a headache.\nEvery chance they get, expect the Bees to get the ball in the air.\nYet Arne Slot has shown that if desperate for a goal, he is prepared to bring on the kitchen sink, even if that means chaos.\nLast Sunday, so many attacking players were on the pitch at Anfield it was hard to work out what formation they were playing.\nI’m not sure if Keith Andrews’ side can ultimately deal with that kind of relentless pressure.\nArsenal 2-1 Palace\nI’ve noticed an increase in some Gooners thinking that because they say something, it must be true.\nThat’s not a reflection on football but an issue that exists in the world.\nPeople now have the ability to share their opinions globally within seconds, no matter if their statement has any credibility.\nThis week I read that Arsenal are a juggernaut.\nI don’t know how anyone can watch how we played at Fulham and say we are a juggernaut.\nIt’s a subjective term of course, but when I hear that expression, I think of the Invincibles or peak Man City under Guardiola.\nIf the Gunners are going to be Champions, it will be because of our defence, and there is nothing wrong with that. Let’s just be humble and take things a game at a time.\nCan City Keep Pace at the Top?\nAston Villa 0-1 Man City\nI’ve heard some Gooners describe Man City as a one-man team, but that one man happens to be one of the best in the world.\nWhen you look at Haaland’s record, I don’t know why it’s assumed his strike rate isn’t sustainable.\nMaybe that’s wishful thinking.\nIs it any less realistic than Arsenal trying to win a title by keeping clean sheets? In a title run-in, what would you rather have – a team with a proven goalscorer, or the best defence in the country? Could be fascinating.\nCherries 2-1 Forest\nThere has been evidence for a while that Evangelos Marinakis is impulsive and thinks with emotion.\nIn the second half last Saturday, the owner left his seat at the City Ground. I have little doubt he was ordering the sacking of Big Ange, hence confirmation 13 minutes after kick-off without even thanking the manager or wishing him luck. It’s his club, but class costs you nothing.\nSean Dyche will stabilise Forest because he’s good at what he does, but it’s another example of impulsive decisions being made. Ange’s ethos couldn’t have been more opposite to Nuno Santo’s. Now Dyche has been hired, a man whose principles are in contrast to Big Ange’s.\nThe Forest squad have been getting so many mixed messages this season.\nWolves 2-0 Burnley\nWolves kick off five points behind their opponents.\nThere are not too many games Wolves will view as a golden chance for a win, but this is one of them.\nUnlike other owners, they didn’t panic offering their manager a new contract, but panic will set in if they don’t win on Sunday.\nIt all comes down to how the home side handle that pressure.\nAn early goal would be helpful.\nI do think Wolves are better than their two points suggest.\nEverton 2-1 Spurs\nIt might be too harsh to say it’s Spursy if Tottenham slip up here, because it’s no disgrace to lose at a ground where Everton remain unbeaten.\nThomas Frank did manage an away win last time directly after their European travels, but a trip to Liverpool after being in Monaco on Wednesday might be asking too much.\nIt’s just if the Toffees have the quality in the final third.\nIf you want to personally send me your predictions email me at danielthemanofdestiny@googlemail.com.\nRemember peeps, if your prediction is submitted after that team kicks off, the score is not valid\nTop 48 Qualify For World Cup\nEJS 77\nJ Gunner 64\nJ Gunz 62\nOnyango 58\nGunsmoke 58\nGB 58\nO Achiel 56\nMe 55\nAyan 55\nJRA 55\nTom 55\nAchizzy 53\nIGL 53\nTerrah 53\nPrince 52\nTeteu 52\nDan Kit 51\nChronicle 51\nKenya 001 – 51\nLadi 50\nDrayton 49\nSagie 49\nSue 48\nAdeski 48\nAngelo 48\nTimothy Adegbola 47\nMatthew 47\nSolwills 46\nGunnerstew 46\nMTG 46\nAmir 45\nAntivirus 45\nJ Bauer 45\nFamochi 45\nQB 45\nStephanie 44\nMena 93 – 44\nNT Gunnerz 43\nAkeem 43\nI 43\nClassy Gunner 42\nThe Shoba Reality Show 41\nAckshay 41\nDave 41\nWale A 40\nOkobino 39\nSamson 38\nKendrick Ohis 38\nBaron 37\nBuchi 34\nSplendid 31\nEnzo 28\nRic Lonta 23\nBergkampfwagen 21\nGunner For Lyf 14\nKobin 11\nJT Gunner 11\nUzi Ozil 11\nBertie 8\nCharles Lwanga Jnr 8\nM Leashim 7\nIlliterate 7\nJoeboggio19 – 6\nWinston 5\nElsammy 5\nMichelle 5\nOlumuyizl 4\nDan Smith\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nADMIN COMMENT\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans.
