All three goals came in the final half-hour. Kik Pierie, who scored the opener, said: “This is what it’s about. It feels like winning the title.”\nPSV missed the chance to tie up second place after sharing six goals in an action-packed contest with Heerenveen. The Frisian side were 3-1 up with 11 minutes to play, but a header by Luuk de Jong and a Xavi Simons penalty earned PSV a point.\nAjax could still snatch the second Champions League spot on the final day after beating Utrecht 3-1, provided they win at FC Twente while PSV just need a point away to AZ Alkmaar.\nAZ in Europe\nAZ, for their part, could overtake Ajax for third place if they can overturn PSV and the Amsterdammers lose in Enschede. AZ made sure of fourth and a guaranteed European spot as Jesper Karlsson scored twice in a 3-0 win at NEC.\nVolendam lost by the same scoreline at Go Ahead Eagles, in a match that goalkeeper Filip Stankovic will want to forget, despite saving a penalty in the first half.\nThe Serb allowed Isac Lidberg to take the ball off his toes to score the first goal on the stroke of half-time, then fumbled a long-range shot in the 65th minute, giving Darío Serra the chance to tap in Go Ahead’s third.\n[banner_3]\nThe Deventer side are one of three clubs vying for the final Conference League play-off position, but they will have to beat Heerenveen, who currently hold eighth place, next weekend and hope RKC Waalwijk come unstuck against bottom side Cambuur.\nRKC’s goal difference took a hammering as they lost 5-0 at home to FC Twente. But they avoided being the biggest losers of the day as Groningen went down 6-0 at Vitesse, in a game that made the decision to ban Groningen’s fans following recent crowd trouble at the Euroborg stadium look like an act of mercy.\nSparta secured sixth place despite going behind early to Cambuur through a Marco Tol header. Koki Saito equalised after 30 minutes before Sparta turned the game around with two goals in four minutes before half-time and a fourth from Younes Namli five minutes into the second half.\nResults\nSunday\nAjax 3-1 Utrecht\nEmmen 1-3 Feyenoord\nExcelsior 3-0 Fortuna Sittard\nGo Ahead Eagles 3-0 Volendam\nNEC Nijmegen 0-3 AZ Alkmaar\nPSV Eindhoven 3-3 Heerenveen\nRKC Waalwijk 0-5 Twente Enschede\nSparta Rotterdam 4-1 Cambuur Leeuwarden\nVitesse Arnhem 6-0 Groningen\nThank you for donating to DutchNews.nl.\nWe could not provide the Dutch News service, and keep it free of charge, without the generous support of our readers.
