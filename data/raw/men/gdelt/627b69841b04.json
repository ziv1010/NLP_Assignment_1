The 27-year-old scored seven goals in eight Euro 2024 qualifiers, and will get his first big test against Germany on June 14.\nDenmark\nDespite his lacklustre season for Manchester United, Christian Eriksen is back competing for Denmark at the Euros just three years after going into cardiac arrest on the pitch while representing his country.\nRasmus Højlund, on the other hand, finished his 2023/24 season strongly with 16 goals across all competitions, including five in the Champions League. Denmark will need him to hit the ground running if they want to compete with the likes of England in Group C.\nEngland\nLuke Shaw is the only United defender called up for Euro 2024 after Harry Maguire was unable to recover from a calf injury in time to compete, and he has plenty to prove himself in terms of fitness.\nStill recovering from a nagging hamstring injury, Shaw would probably be England's starter at left-back if Southgate had his way - that may still happen later in the tournament as he continues to build up his fitness.\nKobbie Mainoo has had a whirlwind season for United, breaking into England's selection thoughts during the March international break. The 19-year-old has done enough to convince Southgate of his quality, though it remains to be seen how much game time he's afforded.\nPortugal\nBruno Fernandes will likely start in every one of Portugal matches at Euro 2024, having played in all 10 of their qualifying matches.\nPortugal have tremendous strength in depth, particularly in defence, so there's no guarantee that Diogo Dalot will be an automatic starter at full-back. However, his ability to play on both sides is a valuable trait for manager Roberto Martinez to have.\nTurkey\nAltay Bayindir made Turkey's 35-player preliminary squad for Euro 2024 despite featuring just once for United during the 2023/24 season.\nFenerbahce's former number one goalkeeper does have nine international caps under his belt though, which should stand him good stead for when Vincenzo Montella trims down his party to the final 26 players.",
