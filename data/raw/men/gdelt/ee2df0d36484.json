  "body_text": "Take it with a pinch of salt, but John Stones could make a dramatic return to Everton this summer, reports Simon Mullock of The Mirror. Stones spent three seasons at Goodison Park before joining Manchester City in 2016.\nIt is believed that City staff have grown frustrated with Stones following his persistent injury problems. The centre-back has started only 18 matches in the Premier League over the last two seasons. Signed for £47.5 million from Everton, Stones has been one of the key players in Pep Guardiola’s project at Manchester City and has won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups and the Champions League.\nHe made his breakthrough in English football with the Toffees. After being signed for a reported £3 million from Barnsley, he made 95 appearances for the club and also made his international debut with the Three Lions during his second season at the club.\nHe has since played 83 matches for the national side, finishing runners-up at the European Championships twice in 2020 and 2024.\nReturning to the England squad for the World Cup next year will be a priority for Stones, who wants regular playing time. He is unlikely to get it under Pep Guardiola and has fallen behind in the pecking order because of his injury record. City have also signed young centre-backs Vitor Reis and Abdukodir Khusanov recently and would be open to selling Stones.\n“Stones has just a year left on his £250,000-a-week contract and would have to take a pay-cut to link up again with David Moyes. But City’s asking price is unlikely to be prohibitive and they are aware that the defender needs regular football to push for a place in England’s World Cup squad next summer,” said the report.\nChelsea set their sights on Branthwaite\nEverton have stepped up their interest in Stones after reports emerged that Chelsea are interested in luring young centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite away from Merseyside. After securing the transfer of striker Liam Delap, a player Everton were also interested in, Enzo Maresca’s side are weighing up a move for the 22-year-old, who has made 86 appearances for the club so far.\nBranthwaite was also the subject of several bids last summer as the Toffees rejected offers of £50m from Manchester United. He is valued at £70m by the club, and the youngster could only leave Everton for a Champions League side. Moyes, however, remains hesitant to part ways with his star defender.\nBranthwaite was impressive in the second half of the league season under the Scottish manager and formed a sturdy partnership at the back with James Tarkowski. Along with Pickford, they were largely responsible for the Toffees conceding only 44 goals in the league - a number bettered only by three sides.\nWhile it would be ideal to keep Branthwaite because of his potential and the solidity he provides, money from his sale could also fund the rebuild that the Blues desperately need this summer, with several players out of contract. Stones is a world-class star who can be acquired for a relatively inexpensive fee and can also be deployed as a right-back and a defensive midfielder where he has excelled. However, his injury record casts doubt on the operation.\nIt will be interesting to see how Everton play their hand as the ball is in their court.\nReader Comments (154)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

First, it would mean we'd sold Branthwaite, then that we'd smashed our wage structure, and third that we'd took a gamble on a player who's played 17 games in the last 2 years.\n2 Posted 01/06/2025 at 16:13:31\nStones has got the breaking strain of a Kitkat.\n3 Posted 01/06/2025 at 16:14:35\nHopefully the days of buying this type of player are behind us.\n4 Posted 01/06/2025 at 16:17:45\n5 Posted 01/06/2025 at 16:18:37\nSomeone might take a punt on a pay-per-play loan arrangement contributing part of his wages.\n6 Posted 01/06/2025 at 16:20:27\nUnless we are obligated to keep the physios in work, it's \"Thanks… but no thanks.\"\n7 Posted 01/06/2025 at 16:22:14\n8 Posted 01/06/2025 at 16:30:44\n9 Posted 01/06/2025 at 16:33:37\nNah, a definite non-starter!\n11 Posted 01/06/2025 at 16:41:29\nI would rather take a punt on a lower league player. Moyes generally gets it right with his defenders, Per Krøldrup aside!\n12 Posted 01/06/2025 at 16:46:03\nOn Stones, he's a class act – and although he's not managed lots of league games he has still played a reasonable number in all competitions:\n2024-25: 20 games (11 league games)\n2023-23: 28 games (16 league games)\n2022/23: 34 games (22 league games)\nYes it's a declining number of games which is a worrying trajectory so I'm not advocating we buy. I'm just saying for balance.\nWhatever the case, I'd be amazed if he signed with us. Hard to see how he, Man City and Everton could structure something that worked for all parties from a transfer fee and wages perspective.\nThe much more logical thing to do is to hunt around for U21 players or teenagers who could go on to become our next John Stones.\n13 Posted 01/06/2025 at 16:47:07\nJust imagine the volume of comments we would have about Stones!\n14 Posted 01/06/2025 at 16:47:43\nStop it — try another one, this one is a non-starter.\n15 Posted 01/06/2025 at 17:00:13\nAs far as Branthwaite is concerned, unless a team offers ridiculous money, he will stay with us for another year… and then we will see depending on how well we do.\n16 Posted 01/06/2025 at 17:04:10\nI don't see a deal for John Stones.\n17 Posted 01/06/2025 at 17:04:11\n18 Posted 01/06/2025 at 17:05:25\nNo. Nothing to see here. Move along...\n19 Posted 01/06/2025 at 17:09:10\n20 Posted 01/06/2025 at 17:12:37\nIf we did have to sell, then surely we should be looking at the Burnley players, or the equivalent to that.\n21 Posted 01/06/2025 at 17:14:26\nI think a loan deal next season with Man City paying 50% of his wages would suit both clubs and player. It deals with the final year of his contract, he is a top quality player and he wants regular football in the season before the World Cup.\nSimply because the article above links the arrival of Stones with the departure of Branthwaite doesn't mean the two are related, or that one would follow the other.\nAnd let's have it right – if he stayed fit, he would definitely play. Stones alongside Branthwaite for a season? I'd like to see it. It also would give us more time to scout for a quality young defender as his successor.\nOf course, if Man City demand a transfer fee, then no dice.\n22 Posted 01/06/2025 at 17:24:14\nHe was confident from the off, and his \"calm down, calm down\" gestures to the Gwladys Street end when they wanted him to hoof to Row Z and he played calmly out.\nYou could tell straight away he was class; those are treasured memories… happy to keep it that way now.\n23 Posted 01/06/2025 at 17:25:01\nWhat we do with Branthwaite will go a long way in determining the ambition of our new owners. Yes, selling him would bring in a hefty fee (which I agree, should be no less than £75M), but keeping him would solidify our back line for years to come.\nAt best, Stones is a 1- or 2-year rental. I've always liked him, but we'll be looking for his replacement almost as soon as he arrives.\nKeep Branthwaite, O'Brien, and Pickford, and get to work shoring up areas of actual need. For context, I'd rather see an injury-prone Richarlison return than Stones… and I'm not really excited by that either.\n24 Posted 01/06/2025 at 17:30:31\nOh for a young Kevin Ratcliffe, but a definite No on Stones. Look for the next Jake O'Brien and keep Jarrad Branthwaite at all costs.\n25 Posted 01/06/2025 at 17:38:20\n26 Posted 01/06/2025 at 17:38:59\nOver rated.\n27 Posted 01/06/2025 at 17:43:13\nA bored reporter creating an imaginary story.\n28 Posted 01/06/2025 at 17:43:47\nHe doesn't put enough last-ditch tackles in.\n29 Posted 01/06/2025 at 17:45:52\nI can't see any Man City player with a name like that, or similar. Sure you don't mean Haaland? 😁😁\n30 Posted 01/06/2025 at 17:59:52\n31 Posted 01/06/2025 at 18:04:05\nA few have left Man City recently with a point to prove and pushed on. Palmer, Delap, Rogers etc.\n32 Posted 01/06/2025 at 18:04:24\nEverything depends on Branthwaite; if they sell him at the right price, then we need a really good replacement — but surely not Stones.\n33 Posted 01/06/2025 at 18:08:05\n“I'd only take him on a pay as you play etc…”\nThen you don't take him, simple as that. The power is with the player and they will just sign elsewhere. No modern footballer would entertain a 'pay as you play' deal. So let's all move on and stop thinking it's a smart bargaining tool. It's not. Even if it did exist, the player and his agent would laugh at the notion.\nI'm not saying I want to sign Stones, by the way. But the idea a five times Premier League Champion player would sign a 'pay as you play' deal is fucking bonkers.\n34 Posted 01/06/2025 at 18:11:06\nOnly 76 days to go before the next season starts.\n35 Posted 01/06/2025 at 18:14:11\nI don't believe this “rumour” one bit.\n36 Posted 01/06/2025 at 18:15:37\nAre you still getting your transfer rumours off Alexa, Martin?\nATB\n37 Posted 01/06/2025 at 18:20:40\nDon't know the strength of it but, at 22, he could be the midfielder that we need. Very pleased with the Blues just now.\nLiam ~£20M was quoted.\nRob, Come on, Makati, McAtee? Not much difference if you say it quick.\n38 Posted 01/06/2025 at 18:28:21\n39 Posted 01/06/2025 at 18:30:12\nWhen you look how we finished last season with Moyes in charge, the squad were not that far off getting in the Top 10 if he had started the season with us.\nThree more wins and we are 9th; yes, that's easier said than done, I know… but it was possible.\nHave we discarded or are about to, too many players? That's the question.\n40 Posted 01/06/2025 at 18:47:54\nWhilst I am not suggesting for one minute that any of our youngsters will ever reach the level of the PSG kids, how will we know if we continually send them out on loan?\nI would hope some of our brightest stars get a run out in pre season before deciding to loan them out.\nIt would be nice to see them givesome sort of a chance to show they belong with the first team squad.\n41 Posted 01/06/2025 at 19:22:40\nI don't read too much into rumours, but this sounds like lazy journalism to me, if you can call it journalism.\nThere will be lots of this over the summer.\nRob @9 calls it for me. With Tarkowski, Branthwaite and O'Brien, I doubt we would pay those wages for back up. I would think there is more chance of Michael Keane being offered a new contract.\nBut we don't hold the purse strings.\n42 Posted 01/06/2025 at 19:23:30\nLet's get Rooney & Big Dunc back – let's all wallow in nostalgia while we sell off our best players! Completely insane idea. Branthwaite, please stay – Stones… stay away!\n43 Posted 01/06/2025 at 19:33:16\nI do feel strongly that a club should exist to represent its community and give a chance to the kids who come from that community.\nBy giving a chance, I mean giving them access to the best coaching and facilities from a very young age - the reason why Mendes, Hakimi, Joao Neves, Vitinha, Doue, Barcola, Zaire-Emery and Mayulu are so good. Only the latter two came through the PSG academy system too.\nWe have a lot of catching up to do in our academy - highlighted by how poorly represented we are in the England youth set up, and also how few Championship standard loans our players are able to secure. We loan out very, very few players compared with most other Premier League clubs - including some that have been relegated.\n44 Posted 01/06/2025 at 19:38:18\nYou can’t beat youth, but there’s nothing better than having a bit of experience in the middle of your defence and John Stones, is one of the best footballing central defenders I’ve ever had the pleasure to watch.\nIf he could stay free from injury he would be a massive asset and would also make Everton, a lot more flexible if they wanted to change formation from time to time.\nI understand what people are saying about learning our lesson after the last few years of total mismanagement, but it still makes me smile when I see so many people turning their noses up at such quality!\n45 Posted 01/06/2025 at 19:45:08\nAcademies aren't free. It costs money to run them.\nWe haven't been producing that many for years. Given where we are located, as well as bringing in kids from elsewhere, there is enough talent on our doorstep.\nJust as an aside, I don't know if he is ready, but the young centre back Reece Welch caught the eye at the test event against Bolton. I think he's already played for the first team?\nAs always, with academies, you don't see the benefit for years after the foundations are put in place. Hopefully we will benefit from what Thelwell put in place before he left.\n46 Posted 01/06/2025 at 19:45:36\nhe’s best days are gone\nKeep buying inteligent Everton\nDarrel 43 you summed it perfectly up\n47 Posted 01/06/2025 at 19:46:37\nSpot on\n48 Posted 01/06/2025 at 19:51:13\nThe young Stones reminded me very much of Alan Hansen, the player. A centre back, comfortable on the ball but knew when it had the ball had to go.\nStones was similar. Calm and composed on the ball, which panicked the Park End.\n49 Posted 01/06/2025 at 19:58:02\nI don’t think Everton should go down this path with Stones personally, but I can see someone doing it.\n50 Posted 01/06/2025 at 20:12:06\nBravery comes in different ways and when Stones, told the crowd to calm down, my immediate impression was that the kid had some balls!\nHe was too good for us, or rather too much of a luxury, because we didn’t need/want a footballing central defender taking chances with the ball, but what class he showed in some games, when he was literally streets ahead of the game.\n51 Posted 01/06/2025 at 20:14:51\n52 Posted 01/06/2025 at 20:19:07\n53 Posted 01/06/2025 at 20:22:37\nIt's like that recent series MobLand. What appeared on paper to have a fantastic cast was possibly the biggest piece of crap I've ever seen. Never laughed so much and I don't think it's meant to be a comedy.\n54 Posted 01/06/2025 at 20:23:24\nNo to Stones ( too many injuries)and no to Richarlison (in and out of the Spurs team) or Abrahams (poor goals return) they have had their day.\nFind young talent from Europe and South America.\nIf you want to be established in mid table then they are ideal but I want us building an exciting young team who play in Europe every year.\nNow is a great opportunity for Everton to build such a team without breaking the bank.\n55 Posted 01/06/2025 at 20:36:05\nBranthwaite oozes quality. He is going to win trophies and that should be with Everton.\nNot that it bothers me, but how he was put in the England U21s rather than the senior squad and then didn't even start surprised me.\nA star in the making, if he isn't already. And we have O'Brien closely following him as his partner in defence. What a positive position to be in.\n56 Posted 01/06/2025 at 20:44:54\nStones isn’t old for a central defender and has never relied on speed or brawn.\nStones has never been the bravest of central defenders.\nWhen the chips are down would you want to go into the trenches with Stones?\nIf you was a midfielder trying to get on the ball and play football, which type of defender would you like playing it out to you from the back?\nPeople talk about formations and tactics but the best formation and tactics are always the ones that suit your team!\nEveryone wants to watch a young and hungry team, just like the PSG team that mesmerised everyone last night.\nCould Stones have played and been an asset for PSG last night? I’d say definitely, but would Stones have been an asset for a Milan team that was on the ropes?\nI honestly don’t think I can think of anyone who would have been a defensive asset for Milan, last night, but it’s intriguing to think of Stones, coming back to Everton, because when you look at it positively then there’s no denying his obvious class.\nLook at it negatively then? I know, but it’s not just about one or two players, (remembering when we had Stones and Lukaku in the same team) but it’s about building a really competitive squad!\n57 Posted 01/06/2025 at 20:48:38\n58 Posted 01/06/2025 at 20:51:49\nI watched the National League play off final this afternoon and a thoroughly enjoyable game it was. The tactics were miles away from the CL, but were perfectly suited to the players on show.\n59 Posted 01/06/2025 at 21:00:08\nSorry I should have left it and went to bed! but before I do a massive point that is often overlooked, is how often do Everton use tactics that really suit our crowd?\nGoodnight 👍 I’ve just remembered what I read in one of the papers, a few hours before Everton played Rapid Vienna, when a few people were interviewed and asked the score and a top European delegate said Everton, would win 5-0 because they just simply steamroll the opposition💙\n60 Posted 01/06/2025 at 21:06:30\nWithout making direct comparisons, it drew me to thoughts of one of the world's true greats, and I don't say that about many players. Probably only 6 off the top of my head.\nDer Kaiser, Franz Beckenbauer.\nHe actually started out as as centre forward, but became renowned for being a football playing, forward thinking centre back, comfortable on the ball.\nObviously a legend at Bayern, but he grew up supporting 1860 Munchen, the other team in the city.\nA shame that his reputation got tainted by FIFA corruption. Same as another great player, Michel Platini.\n61 Posted 01/06/2025 at 21:12:32\n62 Posted 01/06/2025 at 21:16:55\nThe quality of Tarks and Thwaite means centre half is not the priority for me anyway.\nRight back please!\n63 Posted 01/06/2025 at 21:40:33\n64 Posted 01/06/2025 at 21:40:49\nBut it’s not a position of urgent need with Tarkowski, JB and JOB being three of our better players. Ideally we’d be bringing in a talented youngster for that 4th spot.\n65 Posted 01/06/2025 at 21:41:14\nLike us the underdogs in a football mad city, as you probably know, relegated for finances in the mid eighties, to the Bayernliga.\nThey used to take 10,000 to local clubs, imagine Everton playing Southport, Chorley, etc on a regular basis. Taking 15,000 to runcorn…\n66 Posted 01/06/2025 at 21:49:43\nSign Branthwaite on a long term contract. Look forward, not back.\n67 Posted 01/06/2025 at 21:49:53\nThat's why, for me, the likes of Stones and Richarlison should not be considered.\nQuestionable fitness records and top wages are not going to make us more competitive.\nStick to looking for young talented players with potential. Some won't make it,but we just might unearth another diamond or two like we did with Branthwaite and before him of course Stones.\nLike some others have suggested, I like McAtee from Man City. he could be available at the right price and fits the perfect profile for me. I also agree with you about Reece Welsh, still young yet for a centre back, but it will be interesting to watch his development.\n68 Posted 01/06/2025 at 22:05:29\n69 Posted 01/06/2025 at 23:09:04\nI injured my hand breaking a KitKat in half once.\nStones on a free, half his Man city wage, based on games played, could be an asset to us in a few positions. Hopefully he would keep clear from injuries and be a good signing for us. But would he come back to Everton? If he says yes, and we sell J B then sign him, oh, and let Kean go, that pays the wage of J S, and I think he's only just 31.\n70 Posted 01/06/2025 at 23:47:56\nTaking a risk on an injury prone player on high wages to disrupt that would seem like madness.\nI'm pretty sure it's a non starter. Forget Stones and find a right-back instead.\n71 Posted 01/06/2025 at 23:48:13\nHe couldn't get away quick enough and now we have to give him a last hurrah pay day? - GTF.\nFind more young players like O'Brien & Alcarazs\n72 Posted 01/06/2025 at 23:52:46\nBrownhill - 28\nHamer - 28\nWalker Peters - 28 with regular injuries.\nCurrent clubs all want around £20M for them. Too old, no sell-on value?\n73 Posted 01/06/2025 at 23:54:23\n74 Posted 02/06/2025 at 00:05:56\nNext.\n75 Posted 02/06/2025 at 00:27:38\nWe need to keep Branthwaite if we are to have any ambition. And then probably the last place to consider is more centre-backs given we have Tarkowski, O'Brien (who looks very good to me) and if you want a 4th choice, Keane on much reduced wages.\nRB and fast wide players who can put a ball in and bag a few goals are the critical positions. We are alarmingly short there.\n76 Posted 02/06/2025 at 00:37:18\nWalker-Peters is out of contract end of June, so he's available on a free.\nSame for Brownhill.\n77 Posted 02/06/2025 at 00:41:39\nI agree wholeheartedly with Mal #66.\n78 Posted 02/06/2025 at 00:43:59\nIt was too late when Wayne returned and it would probably be similar if Stonesy came back,\n79 Posted 02/06/2025 at 01:51:13\nLet's move forward. Keep Branthwaite, O'Brien and Tarkowski with Keane as a back-up. If Keane does move on, promote or buy a younger, upward moving player, who could, in time, become a good fit as a starter.\n80 Posted 02/06/2025 at 02:26:13\nSure he has had injuries in the last 2 seasons, but he is pure class.\nIf we do sell Jarrad in the summer, it wouldn't be because of this signing.\nProbably pie in the sky anyway.\n81 Posted 02/06/2025 at 02:32:43\nPlease, Everton, don't bite the dust again. We're slowly progressing…\nkeep it that way.\n82 Posted 02/06/2025 at 02:34:23\nSteve @21 might have an idea though, a 1-year loan after which he'd be a free transfer, a 'try before you buy' deal but still there's the problem of the £250k in wages after the loan is up.\nSo money wise, a non-starter and a player with no future sell-on value, we'd just be pouring money into a black hole even if he managed to stay injury free and play all games.\nIf we're looking for ex-players, anyone know what Tony Hibbert is up to these days?\n83 Posted 02/06/2025 at 03:39:26\nI totally agree. Just thinking the same thing when I read your post. For me, not the profile of player we should be looking at.\nOne quality player coming to the end of his career who could add leadership and experience to the squad, à la Gareth Barry, would probably be acceptable, but others of that age would have no sell-on value.\nVijay@75,\nThey may be available on a free but will probably expect big wages, and will be open to the highest bidder.\n84 Posted 02/06/2025 at 03:41:36\nAndrew Merrick 22:and his \"calm down, calm down\" gestures to the Gwladys Street end\". I think that it was the Park End Andrew. Could be wrong.\n85 Posted 02/06/2025 at 05:42:55\nHopefully the days of the prodigal return have gone at Everton.\n86 Posted 02/06/2025 at 06:00:18\nWe must do what it takes to keep Branthwaite and look to other options for other positions. If there is one position we seem to have covered it is central defender with Branthwaite, O'Brien and Tarkowski with possibly Keane and/or Welch, we don't need a fourth central defender on the bench who is also the club's highest overpaid player.\nNil Satis Nisi Optimism doesn't mean putting together a midtable team even if that is an improvement on recent (or should that be including recent) seasons.\nIf only getting better players was as easy as getting supposedly better DoF's and/or systems.\n87 Posted 02/06/2025 at 06:23:44\nTony Hibbert is heavily into carp fishing, he runs/owns some lakes in France.\n88 Posted 02/06/2025 at 06:24:45\nOur defence should be built around him and Jake O'Brien, another with huge potential. Tarkowski will feature for another couple of seasons, but I've already seen enough of those two young players with my own eyes to know they will be a formidable partnership if we keep them together.\nBut I won't kid myself. With our new owners, if the right offer comes in they will apply their business heads.\nThe important thing in those situations, is to do what is best for the club. Get the best deal and reinvest in the team. There are many examples. And although it's only Monday, I'll have to go to confession. Just look at what that lot across the park have done over the years. Torres, Suarez and Coutinho.\nSold their best at significant profit and re-invested.\nI'm not saying we should, and I hope we don't, but sometimes it happens.\nI can see Branthwaite taking over as captain of Everton. He's already shown signs. I think it was at Fulham away, when I saw the 22 year old organising the defence and barking out orders to the 32 year old Michael Keane.\nHe's quality and will only get better.\nTony Hibbert. At least we could have a riot Eric!!\n89 Posted 02/06/2025 at 07:00:30\nIf City want Branthwaite then with my business head I'd say 50M plus Stones (that's 12Mpa off their wage bill), Foden or Grealish and whoever their third rated striker is provided they fit into our post Doucoure wage system.\nAny chance? Probably not but the Rooney days are gone and wasn't it reported that City's owners once said, in reference to another deal, that Everton's proprietors of the time were not used to high level dealings. Time to explain that there's been a change of owners.\n90 Posted 02/06/2025 at 07:17:03\nFortunately Moyes has resurrected O Brien, Tarkowski had been carrying a injury for months.His last injury sidelining him. Mykolenko is playing better under Moyes.Patterson does not appear to be Young's replacement and Keane may be offered a extension.\nGrealish may be a better option as part of a deal.But Stones in known.If Kenwright was about he would return.Hopefully those days have gone.\n91 Posted 02/06/2025 at 07:29:56\n92 Posted 02/06/2025 at 07:53:14\nPersonally hope for Woltemade, McAtee, a good RB and a speedy right winger.\n93 Posted 02/06/2025 at 07:58:01\nI always liked Tony and was surprised he wasn't at the Farewell to Goodison being a local lad, but maybe the nature of his departure still leaves bitterness.\n94 Posted 02/06/2025 at 07:59:05\nFor the first time, probably since Sir John Moores, I can see Everton meaning business and not being a pushover. These Texans will drive a hard bargain whether buying or selling. Take it or leave it.\nWe've seen examples already. They walked away from takeover negotiations until they got the deal they wanted, telling Moshiri to explore other options. He soon came back to the negotiation table.\nSimilarly, if I believe what I read, they didn't give Dyche the pay-off he was contractually entitled to, once our former manager stated he had taken the club as far as he could. That was basically his resignation. So they came to an agreement in our favour financially.\nI am just sensing these guys won't take any prisoners. Silent assassins, springs to mind. They don't say a lot, but they act. And, whilst I think they will respect the traditions, they will be ruthless. They are giving me the right signals so far. All we can do is support the team, as we always do.\nTalking to a mate yesterday, I said that we can become the club we should be again. He corrected me and told me that we will become that club again.\nAs the words to my favourite chant goes. Get your coat on and get moving. The blue boys are on the rise.\nWhen does the season start?\n95 Posted 02/06/2025 at 08:01:25\nThe long-term goal has to be to bring the average age down, but that doesn't mean we can only sign youngsters in the meantime.\n96 Posted 02/06/2025 at 08:10:46\nSo they have full autonomy for a couple of seasons to see how things go and TGF only step in if it all goes pear-shaped.\nIt's what I would do if I was not a hands-on professional, leave it to the experts and evaluate them on their performance.\n98 Posted 02/06/2025 at 08:50:35\n99 Posted 02/06/2025 at 09:01:02\nYes, bring the average age down should be the aim, but I am one for a bit of experience blended in to complement younger players.\nWith Ashley Young and Seamus gone, possibly Michael Keane (32) as well, we will only have 3 players over the age of 30. Depending on who we sign, that average age has already come down.\nPickford at 31 is young for a keeper. Tarkowski at 32, has a few seasons left in him, and Gana has been playing like a 25 year old, defying his 35 years.\n100 Posted 02/06/2025 at 09:02:37\n101 Posted 02/06/2025 at 09:21:43\n102 Posted 02/06/2025 at 09:21:45\nLoved him as a player, and it was fantastic to watch a lad get rave reviews in newspapers for Barnsley before we signed him. That cheeky penalty in Florida showed he had no fear at an early age.\nCould see him going to Italy. A little bit slower and a bit warmer. They'll appreciate a good defender when they see one.\n103 Posted 02/06/2025 at 09:22:46\n104 Posted 02/06/2025 at 09:31:43\nWill be very hard to keep him more than 12 months. And it pains me to say it, as he's class.\n105 Posted 02/06/2025 at 09:31:47\nHe was a very good player then and got even better with City and England has he progressed but now he is not that player and has much as I like roast beef when it is cooked on a Sunday I wouldn’t eat it the next Friday it would have gone off— just like Stones!\n106 Posted 02/06/2025 at 09:33:51\nHave you not been around long enough to know the score?\nIt happens EVERY transfer window and the same posters are \"worried \"\nWise up, ignore them, and stop the dramatic fretting over things which turn out to be utter rubbish 99% of the time.\nThey're clickbait invented using tenuous links a child could make.\nThey're written to catch naive news hunters of which there is a plethora on here.\n107 Posted 02/06/2025 at 09:34:16\nWe absolutely have to keep hold of Branthwaite otherwise to me it sends out the message that we arent interested in success, but just balance the books and invest in other areas. You mention the other lot selling Suarez, Torres and Courthino, the difference being those players had been there for a number of years and you could argue that they had the best years of those players. I would add £145m for Courthino back then was a ridiculous amount of money.\nSurely the Rooney deal should have taught us if you are ever hoping to win anything selling your best players is the wrong way to go about it. Yes you will get those saying but we finished 4th the year after we sold him, but it didnt last. Everybody is after top players so when you get one keep hold and build round them.\n108 Posted 02/06/2025 at 09:39:57\nStones was always going to go onto better things given where we were at the time. That's my fear with Branthwaite.\nBut I agree, sometimes it just needs to go into row Z, or over the roof and get a new ball. Jarrad is quite good at that. He knows when it has to go.\nAround that period, we always panicked when we tried to play football at the back. Understandable, but if we want to get better, we need centre backs who can also play. It is part of the modern game, although\nBranthwaite is special and can also play. Looks to go forward, can carry the ball and worries defenders at set pieces. I hope he doesn't go the same way as Stones, but the sharks will be circling. Let's hold our nerve and feed them fish.\nBrian, you know I've stated all along that we should Keep Branthwaite. We've all watched him and know he is a jewel and I want him to stay at Everton. I've seen enough to know how good he is and will be.\nI'm only saying that if the right offer comes in, we could be tempted. That's not down to me. The club will make that decision, should it be thrown their way.\nTo be clear, my opinion is keep him. At all costs and make a statement that we don't have to sell our best players.\nLiverpool bought Coutinho for about 6 or 8 million. Sold him for over £100m after rejecting Barcelona twice until they got their asking price. I don't think he won anything with Liverpool and left in his mid 20s. Was it the lure of Barcelona, or did the club smell money? No-one is indispensable.\n109 Posted 02/06/2025 at 09:47:56\nIf Branthwaite receives an offer he cannot refuse, better contract, champions league, maybe a better a chance to be in the England squad, he is telling Everton, he is leaving (remember Lescott).\nThe club can say no, but then you have a discontented\nplayer and is he going to try his best on the field.\nJohn Stones has been mentioned and he has injury problems. If he was totally fit, Everton would not be in the equation and as a club and fans, we have to realise\nthis.\nI also notice that Everton have been linked with O Riley\nfrom Brighton, another player who has had injury problems, he broke his leg at the start of last season.\nIs all this showing, we will still be buying or having loan players from the bargain basement stores ?\n110 Posted 02/06/2025 at 10:11:56\n111 Posted 02/06/2025 at 10:16:23\nWhat happened to the brilliant side of the 1980s, blocked from Europe, we lost Kendall and then sold on\nLineker, Gary Stevens, Trevor Steven to name three, we never replaced these players with other quality players.\nWe also think as fans, it can only happen at Everton, not true. I remember walking across Stanley Park and talking to three Arsenal supporters, we had just beaten them, was it 3-0 or 3-1. John Stones played and these\nguys kept saying, how can a club like Everton, pick up these young talented players and Arsenal cannot ?\n112 Posted 02/06/2025 at 10:26:20\nThere have been a few spells where we spent decent money but never as much as those consistently winning things.\nThe last 4 years or so has been our most serious sustained financial position - where we’ve had to operate as though we were relegated at the end of season 2020/21.\nSpending £100m net in just one summer is now a fairly unremarkable thing to do for promoted and mid table sides. Let’s see how TFG handle things over the next few windows as our finances stabilise and PSR issues ease off.\n113 Posted 02/06/2025 at 10:36:37\n114 Posted 02/06/2025 at 10:41:26\nIt started in 1985 after the event that we shouldn't mention and that they choose to forget.\nWe eventually lost our manager and some of our best players and couldn't attract suitable replacements to maintain the momentum due to the lack of the lure of European football.\nBut. There's always a but. It didn't impact the likes of the perpetrators, Manchester United and Arsenal.\nAfter our last league title in 1987, we rested on our laurels. We're Everton and didn't need to do much seemed to be the attitude at the time. Well, standing still is walking backwards, as everyone passes you by.\nAnd we walked backwards through, in hindsight, poor and ill-judged management of our club.\nHopefully those decades are gone now. With the right investment, we will become the club we are supposed to be and that our supporters deserve.\n115 Posted 02/06/2025 at 11:11:52\nI think in terms of world football, Everton are quite a big club. However, we don't really feel that way due to the large number of well funded clubs that we have to compete with in the same league.\n116 Posted 02/06/2025 at 11:14:55\n117 Posted 02/06/2025 at 11:17:32\n118 Posted 02/06/2025 at 11:26:53\nSince we don’t ( we only have about 11 players without question marks over them) it’s not a great time to sell.\nHowever, if we manage to sign an 18 to 21 year old this summer of genuine talent - it might make more sense next year when the replacement has had a chance to bed in.\nEasier said than done of course but it’s rarely a bad strategy to sign up 18 to 21 year olds of genuine talent- and despite the competition many are still very good value\n119 Posted 02/06/2025 at 11:36:05\nAs for some of the other players, much as I love Colin Harvey, he made too many changes when he came in, he replaced better players with ones he thought would take us up a level, Nevin, Cottee, McDonald we’re never good enough to replace Trevor Steven Peter Reid or Adrian Heath.\nTrevor Steven stayed at Everton until after the 89 cup final, Gary Stevens moved across to Rangers in 1988.\nThere has always been a big myth that a lot of Everton players left so they could play in Europe for the likes of Rangers etc, yet at the time I cannot recall a single player asking for a transfer, it is quite easy to use the Euro ban, but for me I put it down to Kendall leaving, then Harvey buying too many players too soon and then letting better players leave.\nFor my penny’s worth had Kendall chose to stay, we keep Lineker, we keep the players that won the 87 title and like others who seemed to manage after the ban we would have challenged for quite a few years.\nThat team started to break up the moment Colin Harvey took over and bought his own players.\nNot a pop at either Kendall or Harvey, nor you Danny, they both did what they thought was right at the time and did a fantastic job between 84-87.\nThe moment Kendall left was when everything changed at Everton.\n120 Posted 02/06/2025 at 11:36:39\nWe all know it, whether this story is clickbait or not.\nI am now waiting for the “Harry Kane? Not while we’ve got Beto” thread.\n121 Posted 02/06/2025 at 11:47:50\n122 Posted 02/06/2025 at 11:55:38\nI think Peter Reid’s best days were gone through injury and I recall him getting booed in one game near the end of his time at Everton, it might have been the game when we beat QPR 1-0 and if I’m correct Peter scored the only goal of the game!\n123 Posted 02/06/2025 at 11:59:17\nDennis @115 you could open up a whole can of worms and separate thread with that one mate.\nDennis, apparently Colin didn't feel up to it in attending the last waltz at Goodison as he didn't think he could make it round the pitch. Joe Royle didn't look good either and was taken to his seat after the match rather than join the lap of appreciation by the former players.\nSome would go further back. The sale of Alan Ball, the break up of the 69-70 and Sir John Moores relinquishing his control of Everton in the early 70s.\nMy memories only go back to about 1974-75 and when I attended my first match at Goodison in 1976, still aged 4, so that's all I can go off apart from reading and listening to those much wiser than me.\nI'm sure those who remember the last time we were relegated in the 50s can point to how it is possible to come back from the abyss and rise again. We've nearly been there on several occasions since falling from grace after 1987, but escaped that unthinkable fate. We can and will be back.\nSome of Kendall's initial signings turned out to be shocking, apart from the Welsh bin man / hod carrier.\nUntil I read his memoirs, I never realised that, as a teenager, Neville Southall (MBE), was offered the opportunity to go to Germany with Fortuna Dusseldorf. He turned it down and didn't think he could make it as professional footballer.\nFate.\n124 Posted 02/06/2025 at 12:12:05\n125 Posted 02/06/2025 at 12:16:32\nI am almost sure we came back into the top league after three years in the Second Division with the same squad of players that we were relegated with.\nI don't remember who was chairman at that time, I only remember Dick Searle who was on the board — we never bothered with who ran the club in those days, which I think you have mentioned yourself, Danny ,in one of your posts, we only worried and fretted about who was playing for us and, ‘til John Moore's came, we did a lot of worrying and fretting with the players we had then.\nI started dying my hair when I was 13½ when it had turned grey with the worry of it all!\n126 Posted 02/06/2025 at 12:18:41\nColin Harvey was always a coach and a very good one at all levels. We could do with someone like him in the academy now. Happiest on the training ground and in the dugout, focussing on the game, not the management side. That was more Howard's thing.\nHe would have flourished in today's game with the DoF model.\nHe had expectations and standards. I can't quote him without looking, but he said that doing it on a Saturday wasn't enough. You have to do it every day.\nI don't know if it was the same match Dave, probably not. I remember being sat in the Paddock. I think it was when he was playing for QPR. He got a lot of abuse and came over as a throw in was awarded. Shouted face-to-face to sit the gobshites down!!\nI can't choose between Peter Reid and Southall as the 2nd or 3rd best Everton players I've witnessed.\nObviously, there is only one number 1. Or should I say 11?\n127 Posted 02/06/2025 at 12:20:56\nFrom stories I read Robson nearly left Ipswich for Everton years before, but news of this was leaked to the 2 brothers that owned Ipswich way before Bobby had chance to speak to them. But all of this is a very long time ago of course.\n128 Posted 02/06/2025 at 12:22:07\nFrom what you are saying, that certainly has been the case at times.\nMy own views are skewed because in my time as a supporter – loosely correlating to the Premier League era – the most obvious issue has been lack of money.\nBut the two things can be difficult to tease apart, I realise – so hopefully the new owners are not short of either.\n129 Posted 02/06/2025 at 12:29:53\nRobert, your time will come. Then you won't have to listen to me from the 80s, those from the 60s and the much elder wise supporters.\nYou and your children will build your own memories and know exactly how it feels.\nThat's why we bore everyone to death with it!!\nKeep going and keep the faith Robert. True blue who has grown up in a difficult period for our club, that soon, we can look back on as history. The future is blue. The city is ours.\n130 Posted 02/06/2025 at 12:35:45\nHave you read Boys from the Blue stuff, Gavin covers the Robson story very well. He suggests the leak may have come from Robson to force the Cobolds into improving his contract.\n131 Posted 02/06/2025 at 12:58:50\nAnd absurdly this finds me on a street in Phuket today, temperature around 40 C, sweat pouring out of me faster than I can drink bottles of water.\nSo I found this weird, quirky bar, The Mad Hog. Witches' brooms in the window, a front door that was 20 degrees off-true, and inside there is goblins on walls, like a trip to Transylvania... Dark, lit by lanterns and ultraviolet light. Funny, I thought… but sat at a table and ordered a long cool drink.\nSitting, waiting, drinking in this dark wizardry place, the ultraviolet light picked out a white EFC crest coming my way on a shirt bright as day... the guy sat on the next table.\nI had to say something to a fellow Blue, didn't I? I never got the chance:\n\"Do I know you?\" was the question he asked.\n\"Well I am an Evertonian\" was my reply.\nLaughter, jokes, of all the gin joints etc, middle of bloody Thailand.\nBut the he said, \"I do know you... you're Christine, aren't you?\"\nTurns out he was in the same class as me in Netherton and his family emigrated to Australia, so Andy Metcalfe, if you're reading this, a shout out to a fellow blue from one who slightly worse for wear and a nod to those who think absurdities never happen!\nBTW, great bar too!\n132 Posted 02/06/2025 at 13:07:40\n133 Posted 02/06/2025 at 13:42:30\nDanny (129), I do exaggerate now and again!\n134 Posted 02/06/2025 at 13:58:02\nTrying to replace the players that left wasn't easy; McDonald and Nevin were only average and the biggest problem I thought was that Reid's best days were gone and Bracewell was crocked sadly, which left a bigger hole in midfield.\nSnodin eventually found his best position at full-back after all his hamstring problems and McCall wasn't good enough; we were in decline from then.\n135 Posted 02/06/2025 at 14:17:18\n136 Posted 02/06/2025 at 14:23:53\nIf the Club can solve his injury problems, sort out the economics, and it were to go through, then I would welcome him as he is a superb player.\nIn Everton, I have faith now.\n137 Posted 02/06/2025 at 14:27:06\n138 Posted 02/06/2025 at 14:36:33\nMy own feeling is that they are laughing their rocks off at the concept of this move.\n139 Posted 02/06/2025 at 14:42:33\nHe also overpaid for Tony Cottee, which messed us up in having the money for a complete re-build.\nAnd in my totally unscientific system, not that effective. To me, a flat track bully. He didn't score the vital goals but added the \"icing on the cake\" (2nd and 3rd in a 3-0 win).\n140 Posted 02/06/2025 at 14:46:10\nI agree. I think it's ludicrous that people believe this could happen, almost as ludicrous as Mitrovic signing for us.\n141 Posted 02/06/2025 at 14:48:53\nCue laughter track.\n142 Posted 02/06/2025 at 14:54:54\nMy memories are from my seat in the Upper Bullens, overlooking the penalty box at Gwladys Street end.\nThis thread may be more suited to the rumour mill, but we take what we can find in the summer months!\nHoping that Moyes and Co are not giving Johnny Stones serious consideration, we have fallen too far behind other clubs with more progressive strategies, we have to buy better, coach better, and develope from this point onwards.\nOur recent history does not do us proud, I think we've learnt that much.\n143 Posted 02/06/2025 at 16:13:44\n144 Posted 02/06/2025 at 18:07:32\n145 Posted 02/06/2025 at 18:32:01\nGood post. Agree with all of it. Thanks.\n146 Posted 02/06/2025 at 20:05:26\n147 Posted 02/06/2025 at 21:00:55\nI don't want to know how the magician does the tricks.\nSensible heads can, rightly, argue that mad spending might have been the end of us; had that Moshiri madness brought even a smidgen of joy it might have been worth every penny. We bought a nightmare, though.\nSo, why worry what John Stones might earn. If he came back he would be a quality signing. If I am lucky enough to get to Bramley Moore Stones and Branthwaite at the heart of our defence would give me a mighty buzz.\nFor me, that's better than fretting over the cost.\n148 Posted 02/06/2025 at 23:45:23\n149 Posted 03/06/2025 at 10:04:32\n150 Posted 03/06/2025 at 15:01:40\nIf you look at our new owners, they are not afraid to sell assets and replace them. TFG looks at this as a business, thankfully to be honest. They have, and someone can fact check this but to my knowledge, sold players who have value at Roma and replaced them capabably, always finishing in a respectable position in the table while running a profitable club.\nWe're coming out of a landscape of near-bankruptcy and debt restructuring. I expect some profitable sales to help our financial situation, and Branthwaite will bring in a pretty penny.\nStones is just a no-go. We'll replace Jarrad with either a capable and reliable player who's not half as expensive, or a younger player with potential.\nThat's my take. I hope we keep Branthwaite, I love the kid. But I hold very little hope of that happening.\n151 Posted 03/06/2025 at 15:14:11\n152 Posted 03/06/2025 at 15:40:18\nI've heard that Branthwaite wants to stay, or rather he's not definitely leaving. Everton have also said that he's not for sale. We shall wait and see!\n153 Posted 03/06/2025 at 15:41:41\nOur financial situation is actually pretty good, as long as we pay close attention to PSR for a bit longer.\n154 Posted 03/06/2025 at 15:47:15\nFor years, we have prayed for a strong business approach to running the club; well, it's a double-edged sword.\n155 Posted 03/06/2025 at 15:57:31\nI don't think Jarrad is going anywhere soon. The new owners won't let him go unless it's a ridiculous amount of money.\nHe's on contract for another two seasons. Get him secured for more. He's only 22 and, despite a bit of a wobble earlier in the season, which we all saw, is playing like a seasoned centre-back.\nAnd it may be urban myth, but his dad is very influential and has been seen in the Winslow, for whatever that is worth.\n156 Posted 03/06/2025 at 16:21:07\nThere will be an enormous seachange in the squad this window so we need as much stability as possible and selling one of your best players is not sensible at any price.\nSorry, Jamie, although I agree with your take on PSG, I don't for a minute think they will overrule Moyes and his team and I don't see Chelsea or Spurs having the room to make a silly bid for him (£80M plus).\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
