There was also no European football on offer at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, though the 2024/25 will see the team compete in the Europa League.\nThe Lilywhites haven't won a trophy since 2008 and Postecoglou has claimed his side should be able to make better fists in the various competitions they take part in this year.\nHe told Sky Sports: \"I guess I'm not the shiny new thing anymore, so there's other new managers. People can go off and discover them and their childhood and not have to speak about mine anymore.\n\"Usually in my second season I win things. That's the whole idea. First year is about establishing principles and creating a foundation. Hopefully the second year is going onto win things. Of course it's easier said than done, particularly in the Premier League and the competition we're in. That's always the way I've looked at it, is that the second year you should be in a position where you can push on, depending on how the first year has gone.\n\"Last year we had some really good moments, obviously we had some tough moments. I think we learnt as much from the tough moments as we did from the good stuff and hopefully that means we're in a good place. We're definitely a better-prepared team than we were last year.\"\nSpurs have brought in Dominic Solanke, Archie Gray, Wilson Odobert and Lucas Bergvall permanently this summer, while Timo Werner has also re-signed for the season on loan.",
