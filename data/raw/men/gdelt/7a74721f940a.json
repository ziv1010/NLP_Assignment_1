As Giona did threaten at times, Livramento got crowded out of possession in the middle of the pitch and some smart football ended with a Girona forward hitting a powerful low shot which Pope met with a very decent save diving to his right. The United number one going on to make another couple of good saves to preserve his clean sheet.\nUnited went straight up the other end and made it 3-0 on 16 minutes.\nLooking very impressive, Joelinton once again won possession on the halfway line, the Brazil international intercepting a pass and fed Isak, he released Gordon and a very good low left foot finish returned the winger to scoring form on home ground, ahead of the new season.\nIsak was on fire and tormenting the visiting defence, Miley’s ball down the left and the Swedish striker turned two defenders inside out, several times, before one of them dragged him to the ground as he ran into the box.\nThe striker from Sweden stepped up himself to make it 4-0 but a poor penalty easily saved on 19 minutes, as the keeper dived to his right.\nThe smart incisive attacking football continued, chances created, yet somehow it took until the 38th minute for 4-0.\nJoelinton driving forward with the ball once more, played it to Isak and his edge of the box shot saved well by the keeper, only for Murphy to get the rebound wide right in the box, he dropped his shoulder and left the defender for dead, his pinpoint cross should have been headed in by Joelinton but his effort hit the bar, Longstaff lashing home for his second goal of the match.\nJust before that fourth goal, a wonderful flowing move that started from Nick Pope, saw seven or eight passes later, Dan Burn somehow appearing at the edge of the box, he ran on to a pass and from 20 yards saw an excellent effort tipped over.\nAs so often happens when you play so well and get the goals in the opening 45, the second-half was a big drop-off. No surprise and especially when it is a friendly, players not wanting to overdo it and risk injury.\nNot a case of lack of effort, just energy levels dropping and no need to get the adrenaline pumping to make up for that, in a friendly where they’d put the game to bed so well.\nOne player who can’t be said to have any problem with his energy levels, is Trevan Sanusi.\nAnthony Gordon had put in a very good 45 minutes having just returned to training this past week, great news ahead of next weekend. However, his 17 year old replacement staked his own claim for first-team involvement this coming season.\nWe were told Sanusi was a very exciting prospect when Newcastle signed him and his pace and skill was on show at St James’ Park.\nNewcastle coming closest to making it 5-0 when Sanusi fed Isak and yet again, our centre-forward ran at the Girona defence and they couldn’t deal with him. Isak ended up drawing the last defender and he put Parkinson in on the keeper, he should have scored but the goalkeeper making a comfortable save.\nGirona finished third in La Liga last season and will play Champions League football this coming season. They won 2-0 away at Napoli in a friendly last Saturday, although they do also play at Bournemouth today with a 4.15pm kick-off, so fair to say they may have been splitting their squad as well last night.\nThe Premier League’s best referee by far, Michael Oliver, got a rare chance to ref the team he supports, he and the other 32,000 Newcastle United fans can’t have failed to be impressed by what they saw.\nA very good night and fingers crossed Saturday’s 4pm against Brest will give a similar outcome, Will Osula set to make his debut and the likes of Bruno, Schar, Barnes and Trippier all hopefully able to get valuable minutes in.\nFinal scoreline:\nNewcastle 4 Girona 0\nNewcastle United:\nPope (Ruddy 76), Livramento, Burn (Stanton 89), Krafth, Hall, Longstaff, Jamie Miley (Parkinson 63), Joelinton, Gordon (Sanusi 46), Isak (Hernes 89), Jacob Murphy\nUnused subs:\nGillespie, Alfie Harrison, Heffernan, Munda, Shahar\nNewcastle United schedule to end of October 2024:\nSaturday 20 July 2024 – Newcastle 3 SpVgg Unterhaching 1\nSaturday 27 July 2024 – Hull 0 Newcastle 2\nWednesday 31 July 2024 – Urawa Red Diamonds 1 Newcastle 4\nSaturday 3 August 2024 – Yokohama F Marinos 2 Newcastle 0\nFriday 9 August 2024 – Newcastle 4 Girona 0\nSaturday 10 August 2024 – Newcastle United v Stade Brestois 4pm kick-off (SJP Sela weekend)\nWednesday 14 August 2024 – The Carabao Cup second round draw will be made around 10pm.\nSaturday 17 August 2024 – Newcastle v Southampton (3pm)\nSunday 25 August 2024 – Bournemouth v Newcastle (2pm) Sky Sports\nWeek commencing Monday 26 August 2024 – Carabao Cup round two matches will be played\nFriday 30 August 2024 – Summer transfer window closes at 11pm.\nSunday 1 September 2024 – Newcastle v Tottenham (1.30pm) Sky Sports\n(The first international break of the season)\nSunday 15 September 2024 – Wolves v Newcastle (4.30pm) Sky Sports\nWeeks commencing Monday 16 September AND Monday 23 September – Carabao Cup round three (This round split over two midweeks)\nSaturday 21 September 2024 – Fulham v Newcastle (3pm)\nWeeks commencing Monday 16 September AND Monday 23 September – Carabao Cup round three (This round split over two midweeks)\nSaturday 28 September 2024 – Newcastle v Man City (12.30 pm) TNT Sports\nSaturday 5 October – Everton v Newcastle (5.30pm) Sky Sports\nSaturday 19 October – Newcastle v Brighton (3pm)\nSunday 27 October – Chelsea v Newcastle (2pm) Sky Sports\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
