  "body_text": "Chelsea enjoyed themselves at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday evening, beating Barcelona 3-0 in the Champions League.\nThe game began at a furious pace, with a disallowed Enzo Fernandez goal and Ferran Torres putting a good chance wide of the Chelsea frame inside the first six minutes.\nFernandez had the ball in the net again midway through the half, and once again it was chalked off — this time for offside. But it was third time lucky on 27 minutes, with Marc Cucurella’s low cross eventually turned — comically — into his own net by Jules Kounde. There was even time for a red card, as Ronald Araujo was shown a second yellow for a foul on the impressive Cucurella.\nAdvertisement\nNot to be outdone, the second half also began with a disallowed Chelsea goal, Alejando Garnacho the offside culprit this time. But that was all forgotten on 55 minutes as Estevao produced one of the best goals of his young career, dribbling into the box and rifling an effort into the roof of the Barcelona net.\nLiam Delap — on as a substitute — then made it 3-0 in the 73rd minute, after a lengthy VAR check for (you guessed it) an offside. It was no less than Chelsea deserved after conjuring up a display that left their illustrious visitors thoroughly beaten.\nSimon Johnson, Dermot Corrigan, Cerys Jones and Liam Tharme break down the key moments from the game.\nWhat does this result mean for Chelsea’s season?\nWhen the fixture schedule threw up a double header of Barcelona followed by Arsenal for Chelsea, it looked like horrible timing. It could turn out to be the perfect opportunity instead.\nArsenal will be a different test to Barcelona, and a tougher one, featuring a much more mature and solid defence. But to lift the mood of the Stamford Bridge crowd before a top-of-the-table clash, it does not get much better than this.\nChelsea’s defenders ended Barcelona’s 24-match, 67-goal scoring run in the Champions League — it is the first time Hansi Flick has seen a side of his fail to score in the competition. Much of that was down to Barcelona’s shortcomings, but Chelsea’s defence deserve credit.\nEnzo Maresca’s attackers looked at their dynamic best again — albeit seriously helped by Barcelona’s failings. Most importantly, Delap opened his Stamford Bridge account. It is the first goal he has scored for Chelsea since netting against Esperance at the Club World Cup, and it was made all the sweeter by the fact that an initial offside call, reversed by the VAR, meant he could celebrate twice.\nIt means Chelsea will face the Premier League leaders brimming with confidence. If they can recover physically for Sunday, they surely have a good chance of laying down a marker in the league, just as they have done in Europe.\nCerys Jones\nAdvertisement\nWhere does this leave Barcelona and Flick?\nThis painful defeat means Barcelona have taken just seven points from their first five games in the tournament, making their chances of a top-eight spot and automatic qualification for the last-16 look increasingly slim.\nBarcelona’s most impressive game in this season’s competition was winning 2-1 at Newcastle in game one. Since then, they have rarely played well, and the 3-3 draw at Club Brugge a fortnight ago now looks even more damaging.\nNext up for Barca in the Champions League is Eintracht Frankfurt on December 9, the first European game back at their Camp Nou for almost three years. They then visit Slavia Prague and finish the group stages at home to Copenhagen.\nA maximum of nine points from those games looks possible, or would do if Barca were playing as they did last season, when they swept through the competition and were unlucky to lose to Inter Milan in the semi-finals.\nBut if they continue to leak goals as they have been doing, there is no guarantee that Flick’s team can win any game. There will be questions over whether the German will change his high-risk approach and tighten up the defence, but it seems unlikely at this point.\nEither they get last year’s intensity and organisation back quickly, or a top-16 place and qualification for the play-off round could be in danger.\nDermot Corrigan\nDid Chelsea deserve their early lead?\nKounde’s own goal had an element of bad luck about it, but nobody could argue Chelsea did not deserve to lead at half-time.\nThe hosts’ first real chance, after less than five minutes, came from a corner kick won by Estevao. Fernandez prodded home after some pinball around the box, but there was a touch from Wesley Fofana’s arm and the goal was disallowed.\nNeither Estevao nor Fernandez could believe their luck less than 20 minutes later, when once again, the Brazil forward created a superb opportunity and Fernandez’s conversion was disallowed. This time, it was a whipped free kick that Fernandez turned home at the back post, but Trevoh Chalobah — in an offside position — had made contact with the ball first.\nAdvertisement\nTheir eventual opener seemed at risk of being chalked off, too: Cucurella looked to have strayed offside during some neat passing from a short corner before his cross, which Pedro Neto failed to put away but Kounde accidentally scooped home as he attempted to sort his feet out. Stills from semi-automated offside technology revealed that Pau Cubarsi’s trailing hind leg, all the way on the other side of the area, had played Cucurella on. Just.\nThe unlikeliest of scorers, but a completely deserved lead.\nCerys Jones\nA familiar lack of composure scuppers Barcelona's first half\nBarcelona did not start too badly in the game, and should really have gone in front when Lamine Yamal teed up a great chance early doors for Ferran Torres, but the visitors undoubtedly lost their heads as the first half went on.\nChelsea’s relentless energy and organised pressing were making it really difficult for Barca to get settled, and their defence really began to rock, with fortunate let-offs with the goals chalked off for the Fofana handball and Chalobah offside.\nThen, at first glance, it seemed that Cucurella had also been offside in the build-up to Chelsea’s opening goal, but Cubarsi had been too slow to get out when the corner was taken short.\nCucurella’s run and cross were then excellent, but Barca still had plenty of defenders back. Torres and Kounde got themselves in a complete muddle, with the Frenchman’s touch eventually taking the ball into the net for his third own-goal since choosing to join Barcelona over Chelsea in 2022.\nA goal down at a heaving Stamford Bridge, what Barca needed was a calming influence from the senior players. But instead, visiting captain Araujo soon picked up a booking for a pointless complaint to referee Slavko Vincic.\nThen, within a few moments, came an even worse decision — with the Uruguayan diving into a challenge on Cucurella, and giving Vincic no option but to show a second yellow. That Araujo made little or no complaint this time showed he immediately knew just how foolish he had been.\nFlick shook his hand on the way off, but the Barca coach must have been fuming. His team’s collective loss of composure, combined with needless individual mistakes, had really cost them.\nDermot Corrigan\nAdvertisement\nThe best Stamford Bridge atmosphere since...?\nThere is nothing like a visit from Barcelona to make Stamford Bridge sound like the old days again.\nThis unexpected rivalry, born out of several heated Champions League games played between 2000 and 2018, always brings out the best in Chelsea fans.\nThe quality of the atmosphere at home games has been a subject of great debate in recent years, especially since the club was bought out by the Todd Boehly-Clearlake consortium in 2022.\nThere have been some high-profile occasions since then, of course. A win over Borussia Dortmund in the last-16 of this competition two years ago was loud. It was pretty lively for the visit of Real Madrid in the next round that year too, while big Premier League games against rivals Liverpool, Tottenham and Arsenal always intensifies things.\nBut this just felt another level, perhaps because many Chelsea fans still feel aggrieved at the manner in which they lost the semi-final to Barcelona on away goals in 2009, when referee Tom Henning Ovrebo turned down four penalty appeals on this pitch.\nThey have never forgotten. There were many renditions of ‘same old Barca, always cheating’ during the 90 minutes.\nWhen Moises Caicedo tackled Torres as he ran menacingly towards Chelsea’s area, the roar from the stands could have been heard in Spain.\nPerhaps the best indication of what mood Chelsea’s following were in came when Kounde scored an own goal to put the home side in front. The ‘goal music’ — The Fratellis' Chelsea Dagger — has been subject of a fan petition to get it stopped, but this time everyone joined in. It was sung even louder when Estevao’s individual magic made it 2-0 in the second half.\nAfter Liam Delap made it three, a mocking chant of, \"Are you Tottenham in disguise?\" rang out, then, \"Can we play you every week?\"\nAdvertisement\nWho can blame them for getting a bit giddy? Beating Barcelona sends a message to their rivals and also enhances the belief that perhaps this Chelsea side are becoming a genuine force.\nSimon Johnson\nIn praise of Cucurella\nMarc Cucurella played against Barcelona like someone with a point to prove. Considering he spent four years at La Masia and made 48 appearances for the B team but never made it to the senior side, he proved his quality.\nOne-versus-one against Lamine Yamal, he made the outstanding teenager look remarkably average.\nOn one occasion in the second half, Cucurella tackled Yamal, then lost possession with a misplaced pass, and quickly recovered to tackle him again, which the referee gave a soft foul for.\nHe may have taken time to settle in south-west London after joining from Brighton & Hove Albion in 2022, but Cucurella has become a key part of Maresca’s team.\nHis underlapping runs have been crucial to disrupting opposition blocks in the Premier League, and one such movement saw him flattened by Araujo at the end of the first half, for which the Barcelona captain received a second yellow.\nAnd it was Cucurella’s pass, with his non-dominant right foot, that cracked the game open. Chelsea worked a short corner down the right, with Cucurella, Estevao and Garnacho combining.\nThey slipped Cucurella into a cutback position, and he managed to squeeze a pass through that had Torres and Kounde in a tangle.\nLiam Tharme\nWhat did Maresca say?\nThe Chelsea head coach was delighted with his team's performance, and praised several of his players. \" Estevao, he had a very good game, not only for the goal, because he helped a lot the team in the way we were pressing. Liam also needed this kind of moment, goal, because he's back from injury. I think against Burnley, he was quite good, but he's a No.9, he's a striker, and they need a goal. But tonight we scored three disallowed goals. So I think we created enough to win the game.\nAdvertisement\n\"The goal from Estevao reminded me of the goal he scored against us in the Club World Cup, that is very similar, same action. Estevao needs to relax, he needs to enjoy, he needs to session, he needs to play football. Him, Lamine [Yamal], they are so young, 18, that if you start to talk about Messi, Ronaldo, I think it's too much pressure for young boys like them. 18, they need to enjoy, they need to arrive at the training ground happy.\n\"But when you start to compare them with Messi or with Ronaldo, I think it's too much for them.\"\nWhat did Flick say?\nThe Barcelona boss felt that Araujo's first half red card was the game's turning point. \"I think we started very well in the game. Had a big chance to score the first goal, and then of course with the red card it changed. It’s not easy against this fantastic team to come back with 10 players. I still look at it positively for the next games.\n\"I said it, it’s not easy against Chelsea. I also saw some really positive things and I’m looking at it for the next matches. Now in the Champions League we have 9 points to win and I am positive thinking we can do this. We have to work on that. I am happy Raphinha is back, Marcus is back, Pedri will return soon.\n\"I think we need a bit more stability. Especially in one against one stability. When you see Chelsea they play more with the body, more dynamic in one vs one situation. That’s what I want with my team. We could do better with the ball, but doing it here in the Champions League against a team like that is not easy at all. I think it’s just one game. And it’s Chelsea. I’ve said everything now. We started good, had a great chance from Ferran to score the first goal, and in the end with one player less it was what it was. I repeat, I think positive for the next match.\"\nWhat next for Chelsea?\nSunday, November 30: Arsenal (home), Premier League, 4.30pm UK, 11.30am ET\nWhat next for Barcelona?\nSaturday, November 29: Alaves (home), La Liga, 3.15pm UK, 10.15am ET",
