Why not! In 2012, Messi made history by becoming the first four-time recipient of the gong – just eight years after making his professional debut.\nAnd 2012 was an historic year for the Argentine for another reason: he bagged an astonishing 91 goals across the calendar year – 79 for Barcelona and 12 for his country – which was recognised as a Guinness World Record.\n2015\nAfter seeing Cristiano Ronaldo triumph in 2013 and 2014, Messi got his hands back on the Ballon d'Or in 2015 – a year in which he picked up his fourth and, to date, most recent Champions League winners medal.\nBarcelona did the treble of Champions League, La Liga and Copa del Rey in 2014/15 under Luis Enrique, with their main man getting on the scoresheet 58 times altogether.\n2019\nAfter three years without getting his hands on the trophy – his longest drought since first winning it – 2019 saw Messi take home the Ballon d'Or for the sixth time.\nIt came at the end of a year in which he won his 10th and final La Liga title with Barcelona – and it proved to be his last Ballon d'Or as a Barca player: he would leave to join PSG just over 18 months later.\n2021\nThe year 2021 was one of great change for Messi: for the first time since 2000, he was not associated with Barcelona – having signed for PSG as a free agent ahead of the 2020/21 season.\nHis first campaign with the Ligue 1 giants proved to be rather underwhelming – but he finally got his hands on international silverware, captaining Argentina to the 2021 Copa America, where they beat hosts Brazil in the final.\n2023\nFrom the moment Gonzalo Montiel dispatched Argentina's winning penalty in the 2022 World Cup final in Qatar, it was obvious that Messi would receive the 2023 Ballon d'Or – having played an all-time great tournament to inspire his nation to glory as captain, scoring in every round and picking up the Golden Ball as player of the tournament.\nIt didn't really matter what he did between then and now (heading to MLS to join Inter Miami was the main thing, of course); he had finally got his hands on the ultimate trophy, and that as good as guaranteed Ballon d'Or number eight.\nTom Hancock started freelancing for FourFourTwo in April 2019 and has also written for the Premier League and Opta Analyst, among others.
