  "body_text": "It was not so long ago that many were predicting this weekend would be a big one for Steven Gerrard.\nWhen his managerial career set off on a steep trajectory at Rangers, he was tipped to be the long-term replacement for Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool. As a new era at Anfield begins on Sunday, Gerrard is gearing up for a different challenge, under far less scrutiny in his second season in Saudi Arabia at Al-Ettifaq.\nAdvertisement\nWhen the stadium he used to call home is packed with more than 61,000 people welcoming Arne Slot for his first home game in the Premier League, Gerrard will be overseeing the Saudi Pro League opener away to Al-Shabab. Average attendance last season — 6,600.\nThe 44-year-old maintains that he will coach in Europe again and wants to make it to the top, just like he did as a player, but the rebuilding process after a serious fall at Aston Villa will take some time.\nGerrard has picked his words carefully over the past year and rarely shared in-depth thoughts on what happened before and what will follow this Middle East experience.\nIn an interview with The Telegraph in May he said his time at Villa “hurt” and that he had to “take full responsibility”, “do things slightly differently and grow and evolve”.\nHe explained how he turned down offers in the Premier League and the Championship because he didn’t want to rush back in and refused to be drawn on whether managing in Saudi would help him in the years ahead. “That’s for other people to decide,” he said.\nNow football is back, eyes will turn again to Gerrard when the season gets underway and he attempts to improve on Al-Ettifaq’s sixth-place finish in his debut campaign.\nIn Dammam, where there’s an excessive heat warning each day as temperatures tick over 44C (111F), the manager is said to be happy with some of the progress and ready for the next step.\nAl-Ettifaq are not one of the powerhouse clubs backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, so they do not have the same clout with transfer targets. It is why there is no talk of a genuine title challenge after finishing on 48 points, half the number of winners Al-Hilal, whose key players last season included Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ruben Neves.\nAl-Ettifaq are, however, backed by the kingdom’s second-largest petrochemicals company, Sabic. They have spent big to bring in Gerrard, his coaching team and several overseas signings, including Jordan Henderson, who left after six months.\nGO DEEPER\nSalah's Liverpool contract: What's going on?\nStill on the books are Moussa Dembele, Demarai Gray, and Karl Toko Ekambi, attackers with a mix of top-flight, Champions League and international experience. Scotland centre-back Jack Hendry is another and former Fulham goalkeeper Marek Rodak is expected to start the season in goal. Georginio Wijnaldum continues to bring class and experience in midfield.\nAdvertisement\nGray has not kicked on to the level expected when he joined from Everton, scoring four goals and registering another four assists in 23 league games. Dembele has been a little sharper, with the former Celtic and Lyon striker scoring 12 times in 25 league appearances.\nWhile this might not be the star-studded cast Gerrard had at Villa — where he struggled to extract the best from a team that included Philippe Coutinho, Douglas Luiz, Ollie Watkins, John McGinn, Tyrone Mings, Ezri Konsa and Boubacar Kamara — there is expectation on the manager to improve Al-Ettifaq’s fortunes this season.\nThe closing months of last season offered hope. Al-Ettifaq were beaten only three times over 13 games and those defeats were by a margin of a single goal. They are working on ways to be more inventive to help close the gap this season. That includes searching for Saudi talent across the country because further overseas recruitment will happen only if others can be moved on before the transfer deadline.\nDefender Marcel Tisserand will spend more time out on loan and others could follow. This summer will not be as busy as the last one, however, and certainly not as eye-catching. Across the league, spending has reduced with a more considered and strategic approach likely, even though links to Real Madrid’s Vinicius Junior and Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah continue.\nGerrard has Dean Holden on board as assistant coach and the former Bristol City and Charlton Athletic manager has introduced new ideas around training. Other tried and trusted allies remain, including head of performance, Jordan Milsom, who worked with him at Villa. The goalkeeping coach John Achterberg is part of the staff now following his exit from Liverpool and is looking to sharpen up his department and introduce a system that helps nurture goalkeepers between the ages of 12 and 18 to build for the future.\nThe facilities are all in place at Al-Ettifaq; a state-of-the-art gym, an impressive training ground and a new stadium. They are a club in a hurry. Translators are available to help explain details to those who cannot understand every instruction in English.\nAdvertisement\nAnd Gerrard? Well, he was rewarded with a new deal in January despite the club struggling for results, and his suggestion that things would improve was proved correct.\nIn a parallel universe, he might have been at Anfield this weekend starting a fairytale adventure. On the day Gerrard left Rangers in November 2021, before that struggle at Villa, the then-trophyless Slot had overseen just 65 Eredivisie games and was recognised only as an exciting coach with potential — but football evolves quickly.\nGerrard’s managerial fortunes are one of many subplots in the Saudi Pro League this season.\n(Top photo: Yasser Bakhsh/Getty Images)",
