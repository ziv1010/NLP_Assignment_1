  "body_text": "Man City rivalling Arsenal for €60m Germany star – Pep summer signing already under threat?\nManchester City and Arsenal are both in the frame to sign rising Germany star Nathaniel Brown, according to a report, and TEAMtalk has analysed how the move could impact two Etihad stars.\nBrown is a 22-year-old left-back who spent time in the Regensburg and Nuremberg academies before signing for Frankfurt in a €3million deal in January 2024. He had a loan spell back to Nuremberg in the second half of the 2023-24 campaign to continue his development before getting into Frankfurt’s first team last season.\nBrown went on to register three goals and seven assists in 33 appearances across all competitions, helping Frankfurt finish third in the Bundesliga – ahead of Borussia Dortmund – and reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League.\nBrown has developed into a key player for the German outfit and has notched one goal and two assists in eight matches so far this term.\nThe youngster is exceptionally quick and excels at going forward, where he uses his impressive dribbling and crossing to register goal contributions.\nBrown is also solid defensively, while he has the ability to step into midfield in an inverted left-back role.\nThe youngster’s great performances have alerted both Germany boss Julian Nagelsmann and clubs from the Premier League.\nNagelsmann gave the defender his international debut during Germany’s 4-0 win over Luxembourg on Friday.\nAs per Football Insider, Man City are ‘battling Arsenal’ to sign the player, with the two Premier League giants having registered their interest last month.\nMan City and Arsenal have both scouted Brown in Germany and are ‘keeping tabs’ on his development ahead of potential transfer talks at some stage in 2026.\nThe report explains how Brown has emerged as an ‘incredible talent’ and has been compared to former City and Bayern Munich ace Joao Cancelo in his home country.\nRespected German journalist Florian Plettenberg adds that Frankfurt ‘already expect top offers’ for their prized asset and will demand ‘up to €60m’ (£52m) to sell next summer.\nBrown is tied down with Frankfurt until June 2030, which means the club can negotiate a big price.\nFrankfurt are great at developing players before selling them on for significant profit, as shown by the recent moves of City’s own Omar Marmoush, plus Hugo Ekitike and Randal Kolo Muani.\nIt is interesting that City are monitoring a left-back considering they only brought in Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolverhampton Wanderers in the summer.\nAit-Nouri cost £36m but only made three appearances before picking up an ankle injury. Nico O’Reilly has since established himself as Pep Guardiola’s first-choice left-back, which means Ait-Nouri could struggle to get back into the team.\nOn October 3, TEAMtalk explained how Ait-Nouri and one of his City team-mates are already facing uncertain futures at the Etihad.\nDON’T MISS 👋 Elite Man City star ‘wants to leave’ for link-up with legendary manager\nPep could be planning left-back changes at Man City\nMatheus Nunes did not impress Guardiola in central midfield, so Ait-Nouri would not be the first signing from Wolves to fail to live up to expectations.\nPerhaps Guardiola is planning to move O’Reilly into midfield in the future, which would make room for Brown in his squad.\nO’Reilly came through the City academy as a midfielder and would like to play further forward later in his career.\nJosko Gvardiol operated at left-back last season, though Guardiola has since moved him into central defence.\nAgent tees up City deal; Arsenal signing criticised\nMeanwhile, an agent has claimed his client ‘belongs’ at a major club such as City.\nThe winger has even been tipped to follow in the footsteps of big names such as Kevin De Bruyne and Kylian Mbappe.\nElsewhere, an international manager has been slammed for making top stars from Arsenal and Liverpool ‘look like Sunday league players’.\nPlus, an Arsenal target valued at a whopping €90m has received big praise from media outlets in his home country.\nIn profile: Who is Nathaniel Brown?\nThe son of an American father and German mother, Brown was born in Germany in June 2003.\nHe broke through with FC Nurnberg in 2023 after the best part of seven years in their academy. Less than a year after his senior debut, he earned a move to Eintracht Frankfurt in January 2024, although they allowed him to stay where he was on loan for the remainder of that season.\nOver his full debut season with Eintracht Frankfurt, Brown ranked in the 99th percentile of Bundesliga full-backs for tackles per 90 minutes. He also managed to provide six assists and score three goals in the German top flight\nFrankfurt secured qualification for the 2025-26 Champions League, giving Brown his first taste of the competition recently after he played in the Europa League with them last term.\nIt also led to his senior international debut for Germany on October 10 against Luxembourg as a substitute. (He could have represented the USMNT instead, but played for Germany at youth level and had his heart set on sticking with his country of birth).\nBrown brings speed to the left-back position, but also tactical intelligence. A profile on the Bundesliga’s official website has even likened him to former Manchester City full-back Cancelo, despite being left-footed, as he can play in an inverted role.",
