But let Merino, Jorginho, Kiwior start.\nNo point in wasting energy during a busy schedule trying to chase a game at a place we very rarely win against one of the most physical sided in the league.’\nI agree, only problem is thats another trophy Arteta won’t win and we will go trophyless for another year.’\n‘Tinpot trophy anyway.’\n‘Did Mikel actually said there something wrong with ball?’\n‘Yeah he said it had an allergy that prevented it from hitting the Newcastle net!’\n‘Seem he didn’t complain. But should tell his players to maybe don’t miss from 2-3 yards.’\n‘Burn and Botman were absolutely solid today.\nTheir midfield in particular Tonali and Joelinton once again an industrious machine. Gordon, never stops running, Isak lead the line extremely well. We looked really tired today. No sharpness at all.\nThey played like they want to be in a cup final and we didn’t.’\n‘Arteta got it wrong tonight. You dont put Havertz in the starting lineup after the flu. Defending wasnt good. The worst this season. Eddie howe got it spot on. Credit to him and Newcastle.\nI dont really care about the League cup. The narrative is win a trophy because of our drought but there’s the Fa cup, that’s a trophy to be proud and of course champions League and fingers crossed premier League\nWhats so annoying is the semi final has two games. That’s one game more we dont need, especially away in the far north…’\n‘Ødegaard should’ve went down from Isak’s push. Much better chance VAR look at it.’\n‘Ødegaard has to be more stronger there. also with how good our defending is putting Ødegaard on Isak was not good matchup.’\n‘Yeah media make out we are the masters of the ‘dark arts’ lol\nIf Saliba had gone down after the clash of heads and Ode hits the deck after the push different results imho.’\n‘If they get to Wembley, at least the current Newcastle team will have been to the same amount of finals as Alan Shearer though, all will have 0 winners medals from their time at the Toon though!’\n’24 shots compared to there 7 showed we weren’t lacking at creating chances, it just show we aren’t clinical enough and clinical they are.’\n‘You also have to give them credit for some of their defending. They got a lot of blocks in & made things very difficult.\nWe certainly prob deserved a goal or 2 minimum.’\n‘Pretty weird how fans of these other prem teams are constantly tryna force a rivalry with us.. like bro, we don’t care about Newcastle.’\n‘Just a wee football club in the Northeast, now and forever.’\n‘The overall performance today wasn’t that bad comparing to Brighton game we were much better Newcastle also you have to give them credit they on form they good offensively (unlike us) they had like 4 chances all game took 2 of them both were really poor defending from us.\nBut if they win this trophy I’d say they deserve it.’\n‘It’s time to get arteta out.’\n‘Sell both of our strikers and sign a real striker who scores. This bs of CF doesn’t need to score has gone long enough.’\n‘Who wants to sign Havertz and Jesus lol? Maybe if we sack Arteta and he gets a new team fast.’\n‘100% some team gets conned by Havertz again. Perhaps some german club after he takes a paycut or PSG as they make dumb signings all the time. In case of Jesus the only club that might actively pursue him would be his fan club here on AM. Otherwise it’s Turkey or some other retirement league after contract termination’\n‘Didn’t watch the game. Us failing to capitalize on chances doesn’t surprise me. What kills me is that we can’t even keep clean sheets despite having a cautious approach. We concede every damn game. What’s the point?’\n‘Lot of time before 2nd leg, we could be back in form.’\n‘Not only Newcastle are so good defensively but we poor of course in a month lot gonna chance but he have to improve the squad also try to get the best of his attack.’\n‘When we run out of ideas you can tell that we play for set pieces and crosses.\nIt’s ugly. It goes against the identity Wenger built. It’s being ruined.’\n‘Imagine if Isak gets injured again.\nBeen carrying Newcastle similar to Saka.’\n‘We looked tired, we looked sick, we weren’t switched on. Gonna take an absolute monumental effort from us over the next few months.\nI thought Rice had a good game tonight. He looked like he wanted to win and ran his socks off but the rest looked dead on their feet.\nThe return leg at St James park is gonna have to be one of those “Special Nights”.’\n‘Expected to lose tbh as we are running on fumes\nDefensively far from our best.\nAttack wise one of those days.\nShould have scored at least 1 or 2.\nNewcastle obvs a lot fresher & were very good at what they did.\nI’m not going to bash the team with tired players recovering from a bug they tried.’\n‘Don’t think we’re that bad. Some shakiness in defence and toothless upfront. On another day we would have scored. Unsure why Merino didn’t get subbed on?\nWe could still go through but Arteta should either consider switching or tweaking tactics within the system. It’ll be interesting to see how Newcastle approach the second leg.’\n‘I tell you right now. Arteta will not play his strongest team second leg and has already given up on this. He will bluff until the second leg though.’\n‘Probably leave few players back. Ode might get jet legged during the 20 min private jet up north.’\n‘I’m taking this as our exit people, I’ll give it a miss thanks.’\n‘I think our fixtures leading up to the second leg means we’re more or less out.’\n‘Let’s have the excuses. We were unlucky. That was absolutely embarrassing attacking display. This is what happens when you are so structured that you playing against 2 really slow CBs and can’t test them through general play\nSo you hope for corners and crosses and hope something falls your way over and over. After 5 years this is the attacking approach he has built. But yeah we were unlucky.’\nArsenal 0 Newcastle 2 – Tuesday 7 January 2025 8pm\n(Stats via BBC Sport)\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nIsak 37, Gordon 51\nArsenal:\nPossession was Newcastle 31% (42%) Arsenal 69% (58%)\nTotal shots were Newcastle 7 (5) Arsenal 23 (14)\nShots on target were Newcastle 4 (2) Arsenal 3 (3)\nCorners were Newcastle 1 (1) Arsenal 11 (4)\nTouches in the box Newcastle 15 (10) Arsenal 47 (19)\nNewcastle team v Arsenal:\nDubravka, Livramento, Botman, Burn, Hall, Tonali, Willock (Longstaff 65), Joelinton, Murphy (Kelly 65), Isak (Barnes 65), Gordon (Almiron 76)\nUnused subs:\nVlachodimos, Trippier, Osula, Lewis Miley, Targett\n(A must watch!
