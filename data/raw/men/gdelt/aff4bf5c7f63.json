And how long has it been since Colombia lost a game?!\nThe 2024 Copa America starts this week, as six guest nations from CONCACAF (the federation for North and Central America and the Caribbean) battle it out in the United States with the 10 South American sides for international football’s oldest prize — yes, it’s 14 years older than even the World Cup.\nAdvertisement\nThom Harris will look at each team’s playing style, strengths, weaknesses and key players, and highlight things to keep an eye on during the tournament.\nLast but not least, Group D pits together two of South America’s most successful sides.\nGO DEEPER\nCopa America 2024 squads: All 26-man selections from the 16 competing nations\nColombia\n- Manager: Nestor Lorenzo\n- Captain: James Rodriguez\n- 2026 World Cup qualifying (ongoing): P6 W3 D3 L0 GF6 GA3\n- 2021 Copa America: Third place\n- Most caps in squad: David Ospina (129)\n- Top scorer in squad: James Rodriguez (27)\nHow they play\nNot Uruguay, Brazil, or even Argentina arrive at this Copa America on a better run of form than Colombia — it’s well over two years on from their last defeat.\nHead coach Nestor Lorenzo joined a few games into that record-breaking run and has won 15 of his 20 in charge, including the last eight in a row. Under his steady guidance, they have beaten Spain and Germany, both without conceding a goal, either side of securing a monumental three points against Brazil, who will surely be their main challengers for top spot in Group D this summer, in World Cup qualifying.\nLorenzo is fondly known as ‘The Professor’ around the national team, a man with a calming presence and a constantly whirring brain. Often seen clutching a clipboard on the touchline, his calculated nature shines through in his team, equipped with solutions for most of the problems they face.\nWithin a starting 4-3-1-2 shape, Colombia are afforded the flexibility to drift into pockets of space to try to combine. Particularly in midfield, Jhon Arias is an intelligent “interior” who plays in the half-spaces, while Richard Rios, Jorge Carrascal and Kevin Castano are all high-energy options who will work hard to provide options for the man on the ball.\nTheir adaptability was on show in March’s friendly win against Euro 2024 qualifiers Romania, who pressed aggressively and caused Colombia early issues in their build-up. As a swift solution, James Rodriguez began to drop from his No 10 position to pick up the ball from the centre-backs, helping to create an overload in midfield, while the full-backs pushed on to drag more players away.\nAdvertisement\nRodriguez’s technical ability allowed him to constantly receive, turn, and pick out floated balls and line-breaking passes to bypass the press, like the one to Johan Mojica below.\nBarely a minute later, Colombia’s 32-year-old captain again drops in beside Jefferson Lerma, this time spearing a pass out to Rios, who has wandered over to the right from his flexible midfield role.\nHaving found a way to create a numerical advantage in the build-up, Colombia quickly nullified Romania’s game plan and were allowed by Lorenzo to be creative in their escape routes throughout.\nMoving forward, Colombia will pick up the pace if they spot the opportunity for a transition, looking to find livewire Liverpool winger Luis Diaz as quickly as they can. Their winning goal against Spain in that same March window, featuring an inch-perfect pass from Rodriguez and a zig-zagging run by Diaz, illustrated the potential of both in a counter-attacking plan.\nDiaz also enjoys constant close support from his midfielder and full-back, confident that they can push on with a solid defensive wall of Lerma and the two centre-backs left behind to guard against the counter.\nSuch wide triangles provided a lucrative route to the byline against Paraguay in World Cup qualifying last November, with Castano offering himself for the one-two on this occasion, while Cristian Borja overlaps.\nIn the end, Borja finds his opposite full-back Daniel Munoz with the cross, with all seven of the team’s attacking players in shot below.\nThe football is free-flowing and confidence is high, only nourished by an emphatic 5-1 away defeat of the United States in their penultimate pre-tournament friendly.\nMake no mistake, Colombia are contenders to win this trophy.\nWhat are their weaknesses?\nDespite their varied approach play, Lorenzo’s side can be wasteful in front of goal — Rafael Santos Borre, Diaz and Yerry Mina all missed glaring opportunities in the 1-0 win against Paraguay mentioned above, leading to a nervy finish to a game that they largely controlled.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to Wyscout, their expected goals (xG) figures suggest that Colombia should have scored around 2.8 goals more based on the quality of their chances in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying so far; only Chile (eighth in the 10-team table) and Paraguay (seventh) have underperformed by more.\nRecord goalscorer Radamel Falcao did not make their Copa squad, he’s now 38 and struggled for minutes and form last season at Rayo Vallecano in Spain’s la Liga, but Lorenzo has opted to call up Miguel Borja, a bulky No 9 for River Plate in Argentina who has scored 22 goals in 25 club appearances in 2024. Borja is a different proposition to Borre, bringing box presence should Colombia need to switch things up.\nWho are the key players?\nDiaz is one of those wingers who has the crowd in the palm of his hand, capable of cranking up the volume with his lightning-quick feet, but it is still Rodriguez who makes this team tick.\nOne of the pillars of Lorenzo’s success has been the careful reintegration of the 2014 World Cup sensation into the squad, even as his club career continues to wane. His free role in behind the two forwards allows Rodriguez to drift into build-up, link with attacking team-mates across the pitch and ghost into spaces where he can create.\n“This national team makes him feel a special kind of way,” said Lorenzo, who will be hoping to rely on Rodriguez, who is with Sao Paulo in Brazil these days, for 90 minutes at a time.\nLook out for…\nExplosive impact off the bench.\nColombia’s attacking quartet to begin games is largely set, but Watford’s talented 20-year-old Yaser Asprilla is a dynamic option off the left. Only five players to see a minimum 900 minutes of game time created more chances from open play per game in the 2023-24 Championship — English football’s second tier — than Asprilla, an elusive dribbler with a range of crosses and cutbacks in his box of tricks.\nHe can hit the ball sweetly, too, scoring this goal of the season contender against Norwich City.\nA stunning strike from Asprilla. ✨ https://t.co/LVX6AqfX0k pic.twitter.com/fPdOW5QLk5\n— Watford Football Club (@WatfordFC) February 13, 2024\nAston Villa’s Jhon Duran is another 20-year-old capable of the spectacular; he’s a powerful centre-forward who has delivered flashes of inspiration throughout his short spell in the Premier League after a move from Chicago Fire of MLS in January last year.\nNot yet the star men, but two exciting young players more than capable of shaking things up.\nAdvertisement\nBrazil\n- Manager: Dorival Junior\n- Captain: Danilo\n- World Cup qualifying: P6 W2 D1 L3 GF8 GA7\n- 2021 Copa America: Runners-up\n- Most caps in squad: Marquinhos (85)\n- Top scorer in squad: Lucas Paqueta (10)\nHow they play\nBrazil have been rocked by instability since their World Cup quarter-finals exit 18 months ago.\nIn the aftermath of Tite’s resignation following that loss on penalties to Croatia, they have appointed two interim coaches and drafted in an emergency third, initially hesitant to commit to a long-term hire with their fruitless pursuit of Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti in mind.\nAt the height of the confusion late last year, Fernando Diniz was juggling two jobs with the national team and top domestic side Fluminense, unable to implement his radical ideas during a temporary spell that saw Brazil fall to three consecutive defeats for the first time in 22 years.\nThe federation finally acted with conviction in January, turning to experience with the permanent appointment of Dorival Junior.\nSome have jokingly referred to his style as “feijao com arroz”— as simple as Brazil’s staple dish of rice and beans — but the 62-year-old has earned his chance, famously leading a star-studded Flamengo side, a squad that many had tried and failed to manage before, to the 2022 Copa Libertadores title.\nHe has managed 20 clubs in Brazil, including 12 of the current 20-strong top flight, and already looks to have restored tactical clarity to the national side with his back-to-basics 4-3-3. Against Spain in Madrid in March, a friendly in which they saw just 42 per cent of the ball, Brazil defended compactly in their shape, happy to drop into a 4-4-2 and being sure to block the attempted line-breaking pass.\nThe new system hinges on an all-action, all-Premier League midfield — three relentless ball-winners possessing the natural flair to move the team up the pitch. Newcastle’s Bruno Guimaraes brings tempo and incisive progressive passing, having also racked up the most defensive recoveries in the Premier League last season, while Paqueta of West Ham is the chief creator, as determined without the ball as he is inventive with it.\nAdvertisement\nDorival’s tendency to add Joao Gomes of Wolverhampton Wanderers into the mix — one of just five players to make over 100 tackles in the English top flight in 2023-24 — underlines his commitment to building a strong midfield that can dig in defensively, but also dance forward to link with a high-speed front three.\nAn example of that verticality came against England earlier in that same March international break, as all three of the midfielders dropped in to help defend a cross from Ben Chilwell.\nThe clearance loops into the air, but Paqueta can spin away with his first touch, holding off the challenge from Conor Gallagher before floating an outside-of-the-boot pass over the top for Vinicius Junior, whose scuffed shot is eventually cleared off the line.\nSimilarly against Spain, it is Paqueta offering himself for the out-ball as Brazil build from the back in search of an equaliser in second-half stoppage time.\nFabricio Bruno fires a pass through and Paqueta is able to flick the ball onto Douglas Luiz to help his team escape from pressure. Paqueta then scampers up the pitch, leaving his markers behind and breaking into the box at the back post, where he controls a looped pass and forces a strong save from Unai Simon.\nWith such natural talent in the squad, the new manager has concentrated on creating a solid base from which Brazil can build, something particularly welcome after that disorientating spell under Diniz. It maintains that important sense of freedom in attack, while bringing back some more obvious structure closer to their own goal.\nEven if it is ‘simple’, Dorival has been quick to hit back at the critics: “Rice and beans are very healthy — and they get the job done.”\nWhat are their weaknesses?\nDefending in a narrow shape means teams can isolate their wingers against Brazil’s full-backs, particularly with a quick switch of play. For example, Spain found plenty of joy in a slick first-half performance (they led 2-0 five minutes before the break) by finding Nico Williams and Lamine Yamal in space, and it was the latter who won a penalty after being found by a floated pass from Rodri out to his wing.\nAdvertisement\nBrazil will move side-to-side with the play in an attempt to stay compact, meaning their midfield three can be caught on the opposite side of the pitch. In this instance, Yamal was allowed a free run at left-back Wendell, before skipping into the box, where he was brought down.\nA holding midfielder who can spray the ball quickly to either flank or a defender who can hit long diagonals, can keep Brazil shuttling across and test their ability to stay compact.\nWho are the key players?\nEveryone knows what Brazil’s first-choice wide players can do; they have both just won the Champions League playing for Real Madrid.\nVinicius Jr is bursting with speed, unpredictability and street-football skill, and will never tire of taking on his man. Despite his explosion at club level in recent seasons, however, the 23-year-old has just three international goals from his 30 caps, so still has a point to prove in the iconic yellow shirt.\nMore assured of his spot in the team is club colleague Rodrygo; though he’s not as prolific in front of goal, he is greatly appreciated for his versatility and work rate across the front three. He spent most of last season operating on the right side – even if his natural position is on the left, where Vinicius Jr plays – and can also play a central role, which would allow Dorival to bring another wide player into the team.\nWithout Neymar around this summer, the limelight is up for grabs, and the healthy competition that spurs these two on at club level will likely kick in at the Copa, too.\nLook out for…\nThe emergence of Endrick as Brazil’s No 9. With three goals in four appearances under Dorival, all as a substitute, excitement is through the roof.\nStill just 17 years old, the Real Madrid-bound forward combines electric pace and a thumping left-footed shot with a genuine desire to put in the hard yards, hassling and harrying defenders and relishing defensive duels, where his stocky build means he can more than hold his own.\nAdvertisement\nEndrick is, unsurprisingly, still slightly raw in some elements of his decision-making, but the ability to switch gear and power into that yard of space is frighteningly clear; he is a game-breaker in crowded penalty areas and against tired legs.\nMore than anything, Endrick has the instinct. A flash of quality from him at this competition could kick-start a legendary career.\nParaguay\n- Manager: Daniel Garnero\n- Captain: Gustavo Gomez\n- World Cup qualifying: P6 W1 D2 L3 GF1 GA3\n- 2021 Copa America: Quarter-finals\n- Most caps in squad: Gustavo Gomez (74)\n- Top scorer in squad: Derlis Gonzales/Angel Romero (9)\nHow they play\nA quick look at Paraguay’s recent results will reveal much of what you can expect from them this summer. They are a resolute side who will not give much away.\nIn six World Cup qualifying games, the side known as La Albirroja (‘red and white’, after the colours of their striped home shirts) have scored once and conceded three times, with two gritty goalless draws in there. A 1-0 defeat in Argentina last October showed they can dig in, frustrate the opposition, and keep any game within arms reach, while a 1-0 home win against Bolivia a few days later showed they can grind out results when they have the upper hand.\nNew-ish manager Daniel Garnero has been in the job for nine months having previously won a record-equalling eight Paraguayan league titles, including four in a row during the Apetura/Clasura two-titles-per-season format, during a dominant spell with Olimpia, in the capital Asuncion. Having also worked with exciting up-and-coming talents in Julio Enciso and Diego Gomez (who misses this tournament through injury) at club level, as well as previous eras’ national icons Oscar Cardozo and Roque Santa Cruz, the 55-year-old Argentinian knows the footballing landscape in the country better than most.\n“We are competitors,” Garnero has said of his squad, “and if we can convince ourselves of that, we will be in good shape to challenge at the highest level.”\nAcross the first four (all World Cup qualifiers) of his seven games in charge, Garnero adapted the defensive shape to his opponents, starting with an aggressive five-at-the-back approach against Argentina that worked tirelessly to both block out the middle and shuttle from side to side to nullify wide attacks.\nAdvertisement\nWhen the pass went to Argentina’s advanced full-back, as below, both wide players on that side would apply pressure and help to pen the ball in.\nWith no way through, Argentina recycle possession here, but Paraguay are quick to shuffle across and tuck into their shape, the front line making sure to cover the passing lanes into midfield.\nThe ball continues across the pitch, and a slow pass triggers a collective jump forward to block the easy escape out wide; Ramon Sosa curves his run to pressure Cristian Romero while blocking off the forward pass, striker Adam Bareiro sprints forward in anticipation of the next move, and two players in behind jump forward to pick up spare men.\nHaving been undone by an early Nicolas Otamendi goal from a set piece, Garnero’s side restricted the Copa and World Cup champions to just four shots on target, a clear showing of their defensive discipline and energy to keep bolting the door shut.\nA month later, away against Chile, Garnero opted for a more zonal approach, sitting off in a 4-4-2 block with two defensive pivots and help from tenacious midfielders deployed out wide.\nMathias Villasanti has averaged over three tackles a game since the start of last season with Brazilian club Gremio, while Andres Cubas has taken just five touches in the opposition penalty area in over three years at Vancouver Whitecaps of MLS; his team-mates can be sure he will not desert his post.\nParaguay’s defensive flexibility will have pleased Garnero and leaves them in good shape to compete this summer.\nWhat are their weaknesses?\nA single figure says it all; Paraguay’s solitary goal in nine hours of World Cup qualifying underlines their struggles when it comes to creating chances.\nMissing key figures up top and prioritising defensive solidity in midfield, they have not been able to get creative players in the final third, instead resorting to direct attacks after winning the ball.\nAdvertisement\nAs the graph below illustrates, they don’t string together many passes in their attacking sequences and move the ball quickly towards the opposition goal.\nParaguay do have difference-makers in their ranks, however.\nBrighton’s Enciso is a lively player with the ability to strike from range. A knee injury limited his game-time last season, but an encouraging 90-minute display against Chile in a warm-up friendly last week, in which he created three chances and attempted six shots on goal, showed he can shoulder the attacking responsibility.\nThen there is Miguel Almiron, who has tailed off slightly since an 11-goal Premier League season for Newcastle United in 2022-23. He could feel the heat from Sosa, a sensationally quick winger who can strike the ball cleanly when cutting in from either side.\nTeams have nil-nilled their way through the Copa America before, but in such a strong group, Garnero will need to add some attacking bite.\nWho are the key players?\nBehind Paraguay’s relentless midfield is an even more relentless defender.\nGustavo Gomez is front-footed in the challenge, a rugged centre-back who will not hesitate to charge into midfield to sweep up. The Paraguay captain is tall (185cm/6ft 1in), strong, and a good reader of the game, gripped with an intensity and a competitive spirit that fuels the rest of the team.\nThe 31-year-old has also led Brazil’s Palmeiras to two league titles and consecutive Copa Libertadores crowns since taking the armband there and will be his country’s courageous last line of defence in the weeks ahead.\nLook out for…\nGomez’s goals.\nThe centre-back has scored 37 in 299 appearances for Palmeiras, including nine in 30 in a prolific 2022 league campaign.\nThe odd penalty has helped, but his aerial dominance and desire will make him the primary target for every Paraguayan corner and swung-in set piece.\nAdvertisement\nCosta Rica\n- Manager: Gustavo Alfaro\n- Captain: Francisco Calvo\n- Post-2022 World Cup record: P18 W7 D2 L9 GF28 GA29\n- 2022 World Cup: Group stage\n- Most caps in squad: Joel Campbell (139)\n- Top scorer in squad: Joel Campbell (27)\nHow they play\nCosta Rica have broadly been the best team among the Caribbean nations since three players — Keylor Navas, Bryan Ruiz, and a young Joel Campbell — burst onto the scene, but they will travel to the United States this summer with only one of those era-defining figures in the squad.\nRuiz’s retirement at age 37 following the 2022 World Cup was not so much of a surprise, but Navas’ announcement in late May that he was giving up the international game stopped a country in its tracks. He had won 114 caps and the decision left Costa Rica with a selection headache in goal for the first time in over 16 years.\nThey also head into their new era with a new head coach, Gustavo Alfaro, who brings over three decades of experience to oversee the rebuild.\nStill known as “Lechuga” (Lettuce), a reference to the curly hair he had as a child, the 62-year-old took Ecuador to that World Cup 18 months ago, cultivating an attractive brand of fast, attacking football in a transitional 4-3-3, but early signs in his current job suggest the priority will be to tighten things up at the back. Within two weeks of starting work, he watched his side lose 6-1 on aggregate to Panama in a CONCACAF Nations League quarter-final last November, and in response scrapped the 4-4-2 defensive shape for a back five.\nTheir 3-1 win over fierce local rivals Honduras a few months later in a single-leg, neutral territory play-off for Copa America qualification showed the new plan in action. Joseph Mora and Gerald Taylor stepped into the wing-back roles, while a narrow front three were ready to press hesitant ball-playing defenders.\nThe shape also made it easy for Costa Rica to transition into a productive attacking shape, the wing-backs pushing on and providing the width, while wingers Warren Madrigal and Alvaro Zamora stayed close to lively No 9 Manfred Ugalde down the middle in a 3-2-5.\nUgalde is constantly on the move, dropping into spaces to offer himself for the pass or sprinting in behind to stretch the defence. And as Costa Rica’s second goal of that match illustrated, assisted by the 22-year-old Spartak Moscow striker, they can benefit from his dynamic movement with narrow attackers close by to pick up the scraps.\nAdvertisement\nWith the wing-backs high and wide to stretch the Honduras defence, Julio Cascante steps forward from defence with options up ahead.\nHe looks for Ugalde with a long pass over that defence, who is able to reach the bouncing ball and flick a header back over his shoulder, which Madrigal latches onto from his central position to score.\nAlfaro has had plenty of challenges thrown his way, but their opening two 2026 World Cup qualifiers this month have given him time to fine-tune those attacking sequences in competitive games. A 4-0 win over St Kitts and Nevis also saw the Argentinian select that same front three and a midfield of Jefferson Brenes and Orlando Galo, suggesting he is starting to settle on a starting XI. They followed that up by beating Grenada, 3-0 away.\nWith Costa Rica kicking off their tournament against Brazil on Monday (early Tuesday UK time) in Los Angeles, Alfaro will be under no illusions as to the challenges that lie ahead.\nWhat are their weaknesses?\nPut simply, they concede too many goals. In the past year, they have shipped three to Panama (twice), four to the United Arab Emirates and another four to Martinique (albeit in a game they won, scoring six themselves).\nThey are especially prone to losing the ball in midfield, producing some poor touches and overhit passes when under pressure.\nThe defensive structure has looked more robust under Alfaro; his side were very quick to retreat into a back five in that play-off against Honduras and managed to weather an early storm with good energy to defend the box.\nBut they do have a mistake in them, and their technical ability will be put to the test under an intense pressure from their first two group opponents, Brazil and Colombia.\nWho are the key players?\nUgalde is the bright spark in attack, now playing his club football in Russia after a big-money move from FC Twente of the Netherlands in January this year. He has the pace and verticality to hit teams on the break, as well as the confidence to take attacking responsibility and demand the ball from his team-mates in build-up.\nAdvertisement\nFurther back, central defender Francisco Calvo is a valuable source of experience in a young squad — he and forward Campbell are the only two players in it with more than 27 caps.\nLook out for…\nCosta Rica conceding sensational goals.\nRecently, we’ve seen vicious free kicks from Angel Di Maria of Argentina and Panama’s Michael Murillo, an unstoppable volley by Michaell Chirinos for Honduras and a 40-yard dipper against the UAE; particularly with the goalkeeping uncertainty, opponents might continue to try their luck from range.\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: John Bradford)",
