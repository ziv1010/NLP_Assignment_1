Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nIt’s claimed Liverpool are yet to give up hope of landing Isak, but Barcola is one of two names – along with Real Madrid’s Rodrygo – that ‘stand out’ should a move for Newcastle’s talisman prove impossible.\nThe Merseyside giants are said to have been ‘following Barcola for a long time’ and could take advantage of this ‘loyalty’ to convince the winger to move to swap Paris for Anfield.\nHowever, the report suggests PSG are unlikely to let Barcola leave for anything less than €100 million (£87m) this summer.\nBarcola’s current contract at the French capital runs through to June 2028.\nThe 22-year-old has scored 26 goals in 103 games since joining PSG from Lyon back in 2023, helping the club win seven pieces of silverware, including last season’s Champions League trophy in that time.\nIn May, Barcola was named in the UNFP Ligue 1 Team of the Year along with eight of his PSG team-mates.\nMore Trending\nBayern Munich have also registered a strong interest in Barcola in recent months, but Luis Enrique has been keen to shut down any suggestion that the France international could be on the move.\n‘Bradley Barcola’s future? I have no doubt he’ll remain our player,’ the PSG head coach told reporters in June.\n‘We like the fact that our players are interesting to other clubs. But he’s one of those young players we’ve been banking on.\n‘I expect him to play here for many more years.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Manchester United receive two loan offers for Antony with Premier League rival interested\nMORE: Jermain Defoe tells Tottenham to sign ‘special’ £68m star ahead of Arsenal",
