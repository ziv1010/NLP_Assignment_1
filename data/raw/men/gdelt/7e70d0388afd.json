I was at Arsenal for four years, but in the 2024–25 season, I only played five minutes. I spent the entire year in rehabilitation.\n“During that time, I was under a lot of pressure and uncertainty. Honestly, my heart wasn’t really in it anymore. I started asking myself, ‘Do I really have a future here?’ With all those factors [yes, I was thinking about leaving], I definitely had that thought.\n“Once I had decided to leave, I went around saying goodbye to my teammates, coaches, and staff. I walked into the locker room, the staff offices, and told each person, ‘I’m leaving.’\n“Through this process, I truly felt again that I was really loved by everyone here. That made me very happy. My teammates were surprised too, since I still had a contract, and I was still recovering from injury.”",
