He explained that he started playing “properly” at the age of 10.\n“I remember I started football at six at São Caetano, but really it was at 10 at the football academy where I started properly. I send my love to Marcelinho and Sandra, because they were key to my growth, as a player and personally, from 6 to 16,” he said, according to Showmax.\n“I remember it like it was yesterday, when my late dad took me there. I lost my dad when I was 10. He took me there to try to take the first steps in my career. It’s very moving. It feels like yesterday, it’s still very memorable to this day,” he continued.\nMURILLO ON FUTURE PLANS\nThe footballer, whose contract with Nottingham Forest has extended to 2029, went on to say that his goal is to achieve something that no one has ever done.\n“My goal is to achieve something nobody has ever done. I think there’s a quote that says: ‘If someone does something, I’ll do it too. And if nobody has, I’ll be the first one to do it.’ I try to leave my mark wherever I go, so people can say: ‘Murillo was a great player. He’s played here’,” he said.\nHe went on to explain that he aims to leave a legacy in the Premier League.\n“I try to leave this legacy. I’m trying my best to get the team into the Champions League, to perform well in the Premier League, and to reach the level I know I’m capable of. It’s about playing my best for the fans who are always there showing their support, and, above all earning the respect of all the players and the club staff. That’s the main thing, when people see you and say, ‘not only was he a good player, but a great human being, a great man.’ I think that’s the main thing,” he continued.\nWHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE FOOTBALLER?\nLet us know by leaving a comment below, or send a WhatsApp to 060 011 021 1\nSubscribe to The South African website’s newsletters and follow us on WhatsApp, Facebook, X and Bluesky for the latest news.",
