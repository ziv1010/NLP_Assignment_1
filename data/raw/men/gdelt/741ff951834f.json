  "body_text": "Everton 1 - 2 Southampton\nEverton took the lead against Southampton in this vital relegation clash but were stunned by two second-half goals from Ward-Prowse that left them and the Goodison crowd reeling as they staged a massive post-match sit-in.\nThe atmosphere for this mid-season game had been ramped up by a series of events which only emphasise the extreme importance of the result.\nTo achieve that result, Frank Lampard has gone with three changes from their last Premier League game - the 4-1 loss at home to Brighton.\nAmadou Onana, Ben Godfrey and Seamus Coleman come in while Alex Iwobi starts despite being an injury concern after injuring his ankle in the FA Cup loss at Manchester United. No place for Anthony Gordon, who starts on the bench.\nSouthampton kicked off but soon stopped with an injury to Godfrey after he fell awkwardly. Southampton restarted and overlapped down the right, Tarkowski coming across with a great sliding tackle to stall them. But Saints saw most of the play in the first 5 minutes.\nA couple of balls were swung in toward Calvert-Lewin , Pickford playing it long, but he was either not fit enough or not alert enough to get on the end of them as he was easily marshalled by the Saints defence.\nEverton worked it well down the right but Ward-Peters slid in on Coleman, giving away a free-kick that was swung in by Gray and cleared. Adams then fouled Tarkowski in what was becoming a very scrappy game.\nOnana was the next to make a vital tackle on Walker-Peters but Calvert-Lewin was offside for the through ball.\nLavia then grabbed Onana's shirt and he got an early yellow card. The free-kick was delivered right onto Calvert-Lewin's head but he didn't catch it well enough and it was easily saved.\nEverton got some possession but did their daft sideways and backwards until Pickford hoofed it upfield. But the vistors' defence was too solid. The Blues eventually tried to play forward ball and Gray darted onto a great ball from Mykoleno but was driven too wide to convert.\nSaints did get into the Everton area and looked very dangerous but somehow Everton cleared and went on to build a decent attack with Mylenko overlapping but his cross was blocked away and the Blues went backwards and around again.\nTarkowski tried to power past Lyanko and won the foul. Gray's free-kick was easily picked out of the air. But Gray won it back and Onana decide to lash a shot vaguely goalwards and wide.\nBut Southampton somehow failed to score when Ward-Proswse's shot was deflected almost in at the far top corner, Salisu powered a fierce header at Pickford from the Saints corner. That's two warnings in the space of 30 seconds.\nEverton built a much better higher-tempo attack that forced a corner, Calvert-Lewin getting close but not close enough to Gray's decent delivery. At the other end, Salisu put a shot over as the visitors had a spell of attacking.\nEverton built another attack but Gray could only win a corner off Walker-Peters. And Onana edged back off his marker to nod a fine outswinger from Gray down past Banuzu and into the net – his first goal for Everton and he really took it well.\nGray was fouled and put another ball onto Onana's head at the far post, that Bazunu had covered but then lost off the knee of a defender but no Everton player could get a boot to it.\nIwobi advanced and tried a curler that didn't curl in quite enough. But somehow Southampton got through and Ward-Prowse placed a perfect shot low into the corner but Pickford got down with an incredible save onto the post concede a late corner that Onana headed clear.\nEverton had dominated large parts of the play in a much higher-tempo half that had been played mostly on the front foot, and fully merited their slender lead.\nEverton restarted but Ward-Prowse soon made up for it, pouncing on a perfect knock-down from Adams and evading a blocking tackle by Godfrey to drive it with ease past Pickford, leaving Everton with it all to do again.\nIt was a massive blow to the Blues who had to quickly regroup but it was Southampton who won a corner, headed away by Onana and Walker-Peters fouled Calvert-Lewin. But Everton failed to take the ball forward as the Saints blocked off all avenues.\nIwobi did exceptionally well to win the ball off Salisu and then feed Gray but his shot was very disappointing. We know he can do so much better. Ben Godfrey then drove forward and played in Calvert-Lewin whose deflected shot looked to be floating in but smacked off the bar!!!\nGray was rugby-tackled by Diallo but his free-kick was cleared. Onan and Iwobi tried to keep the pressure on until Saints countered but the Blues fell back well.\nColeman had to shoulder-barge Edozie over into the area, and was a ittle lucky not to get it called as a penalty. Ward-Peowse's corner was fired over at tremdous pace.\nImmediately after Saints subs, Godfrey had to get down well to block Armstrong's first attempt as Blues struggled to get the same forward momentum and instead resorted to frightening turnovers. From one, Ward-Prowse fired in a dangerous strike that Pickford tracked all the way.\nEverton's attacking zeal had flagged badly and Lampard pondered that perhaps he might use one of his nine subs just as Armstrong got behind Coady who did well to recover.\nEverton worked up a decent counter until Gray lost it and more minutes ticked by with Everton struggling to control the game. Onana went on a good run and Diallo saw yellow for pulling him back.\nOnana put in a brilliant cross that saw Cavert-Lewin challenge Banuzu who got a touch that made it very difficult for Godrey to control at the far post.\nCavert-Lewin did very well to get behind and tried to find Gordon with a low cross but again Banuzu touched the ball away from him.\nGordon looked to advance but Salisu easily blocked him. Diallo fouled Gana for a distant free-kick that Gray sent in deep for a corner with Onana coming around the back.\nGray's corner was cleared and then Saints were on the break, Gordon giving away a poor free-kick in a very dangerous location. Ward-Prowse moved the kick 5 yards back to give him better angle and the ref allowed him to place it well beyond the static Pickford. Just shocking refereeing.\nSouthampton were now rampant and surging forward with shocking ease on cheap Everton turnovers. Lampard's late late masterstroke(?) was to trust the much hyped Ellis Simms on in place of Gana Gueye just before a well-won corner was taken.\nGray swung it in but it was cleared by Adams. Everton tried to regroup but now Saints battened down at the back, Gordon's cross cleared.\nEverton laboured manfully to circulate the ball around the Saints area until Gray's cross came in and Banuzu clutched it.\nCoady narrowly avoided being sandbagged on a bouncing ball as Everton struggled to get forward and a long ball from Pickford went straight through to Banuzu.\nEverton put everything forward and were in great danger of being exposed on the counter as 4 minutes of added time. Gordon finally showed up but Banuzu touched his cross up and Tarkowski's shot went behind, with nothing coming from the corner.\nLyanco was booked for a poor lunge on Coady. Another corner was swung over but it was ultimately cleared.\nTime ran out and the Blues slumped to their worst possible result in the circumstances.\nEverton: Pickford, Coleman (69' Gordon), Godfrey, Coady, Tarkowski, Mykolenko, Gana (81' Simms), Onana, Iwobi, Gray, Cavert-Lewin.\nSubs: Begovic, Holgate, Mina, Doucouré, Davies, McNeil, Maupay,.\nSouthampton: Bazunu; Caleta-Car, Lyanco [Y:90+2'], Salisu; Walker-Peters, Ward-Prowse, Lavia (61' Alcaraz), Diallo (85' Maitland-Niles) [y, Elyounoussi; Edozie (61' Armstrong), Che Adams (85' Mara).\nReader Comments (781)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Maybe we can take a point in the away matches against the top 6 nothing more than that.\nGray and Gordon gave the second goal to them instead of score to us, that is a good resume of our wingers and their capabilities.\nIt is beyond me why Mina did not play, he is our best defence. Tarkowski gave the first goal and Coady and Godfrey are definitely less than Mina.\nOnana and Pickford are the only Premier League players we have. I really hope that next year we rebuilt the team in the Championship and I hope we can sell now Gordon, Gray, Gueye, Patterson, Davies, Doucoure, Godfrey and all the garbage and mercenaries we have.\nThe board in clueless but they are not the main reason of our performance. The main reason are the management staff and the mercenaries on the pitch.\nFinally the illiterate can stay as our manager, it is better to avoid pay the compensation that hire another illiterate. Bring in Van gaal or Bielsa. If not I prefer the illiterate to stay in charge.\n375 Posted 14/01/2023 at 16:58:54\nTruly and fucked well.\n376 Posted 14/01/2023 at 16:58:58\nA half-decent start but Lampard cannot inspire this team to tighten up when necessary and quite honestly he lacks what it takes at this level.\nIf the board fails to act now then down we go for sure.\nIt's a bloody embarrassment all round.\n377 Posted 14/01/2023 at 16:59:10\n378 Posted 14/01/2023 at 16:59:17\n379 Posted 14/01/2023 at 16:59:23\n380 Posted 14/01/2023 at 16:59:24\n381 Posted 14/01/2023 at 16:59:34\nI was quite happy with first half and we had moments in the second, but I don't understand what was said for the second half?\nnb: I'm not against this demonstration. But there's zero chance that we'll be saying goodbye to Kenwright. Lampard I think is done though.\n382 Posted 14/01/2023 at 16:59:38\n383 Posted 14/01/2023 at 16:59:47\nHe's got to go!\n384 Posted 14/01/2023 at 16:59:54\n385 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:00:21\n386 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:00:40\nWe lost at home to a team who have lost seven straight games and are bottom. We're just unlucky eh?\n387 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:01:03\nOnana was great, Gray and Gordon were diabolical.\n388 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:01:05\nThis is the thing. There are too many players that make wrong decisions all the time. With a good manager, we could have cancel this out. But it seems that Lampard does not recognice them.\nAlso, add bad strategy. Long balls to Calvert-Lewin? How the hell is that going to work? It did not create a single chance.\n389 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:01:11\nWe have to thank the board, what other club would sell there best player Richarlison, after escaping relegation?\nKenwright, thanks for ruining this club. Time to say Good-Bye. I thought Lampard would turn things around, definitely time to go.\n390 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:01:51\n391 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:01:58\n392 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:02:06\n393 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:02:17\nThey have one good player who can pass, cross, score and control a game. We needed to man-mark Ward-Prowse out of the game. Nope. We gave him the freedom of the park.\nWe tired, got over run and Frank failed to make any changes until it was too late. They made changes for fresh legs and we didn't. We lost the midfield battle and the game.\nBye Frank.\n394 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:02:52\nNo more Match of the Day. Hardly any coverage. A massive loss of status, and one we're not accustomed to.\nYou've got to act quickly when things are going south, and we've spectacularly failed to do so.\n395 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:03:04\n396 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:03:06\n397 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:03:10\n398 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:03:11\nThen Lampard has to resort to his infatuation with two wingers and brought on Gordon whose only notable action was a needless elbow in the back near our own penalty area to a team who have a dead-ball specialist. Pathetic!\nI don't think there are any worse teams to play and it appears we are one of the three worst teams in the Premier League that will keep somebody up!\n399 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:03:13\n400 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:03:22\n401 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:04:01\n402 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:04:01\n403 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:04:11\nThey're just nowhere near good enough. It was true against Wolves when we were 'unlucky', it was true for the first hour against Brighton. We have the effort but not the quality. That's even worse from our perspective because there isn't another gear. It's not going to get better.\nForget everything else. Forget managerial changes. It's signings or relegation. It's that simple.\nThe only one I'd question is Calvert-Lewin. I think Lampard needs to look him in the eyes and find out if he's really up for the fight we're in. I didn't see it today. Be interested to get a perspective from someone at the ground on that.\n404 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:04:12\n405 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:04:50\n406 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:05:19\nAll of whom had issues but all had moments of quality and three of them were mainly responsible for our goals. The only one left is Calvert-Lewin who's been a non-factor because of injuries and form for 2 years now.\n407 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:05:24\nHe should have gone before the World Cup!\n408 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:05:37\nHalf way through the season and struggling to put a result together. I despair, it shouldn't be panic time with 19 fixtures to play! But it is.\n409 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:05:47\nFooty isn't done on that logic. Man City are currently stinking the place out as are Liverpool.\nWe just need to keep a couple of points better than Leeds, Southampton and Bournemouth. It is entirely doable.\n410 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:06:25\nI don't want that gravy-swigging dinosaur anywhere near Everton ever again.\n411 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:06:28\n412 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:06:30\nEven the players we're being linked with are the wrong type of player we need.\nFor those proposing Bielsa, we don't have the players for his style. I'd take Sean Dyche.\nNot felt as low as this and there's been some lows.\n413 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:06:42\nA pitiful shambles. I'm sure i'm not the only one who can spend the next years going on about the teams in the 60's and 80's, and blubber Bill (who bangs on about those days) wasn't here today to see the state we are in\n414 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:07:06\nNobody knows what to do because no-one is properly in charge. I said this morning that this wan't a defining game but I now fear that it was. I think we are finished, and not merely in the Premier League. You can smell the death.\n415 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:07:35\nThe players we have today are not good enough. There are some with potential, if managed right. Like Gray, Onana and DCL. Apart from that, I don't know. For 6 years we have not had a single good offensive central midfielder. What tha f*ck is tha all about. How can no one see this problem? Useless managers.\n416 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:08:00\nI'd be getting Dyche in as soon as possible, not a popular choice but in the words of our current manager '' It's where we are at the moment''\nWe are a championship level side, and a bad one at that!!\n417 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:08:22\n418 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:08:33\n419 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:08:50\n420 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:09:28\nTo get out of this right mess we need a miracle as the players we need at the quality and skill we need are way out of our league given the financial mess we are in as a result of the board and owners negligence. Loans, free transfers and young up and coming players are not going to get us out of what is now, terminal decline.\nThanks Frank for keeping us up last season with the help of the supporters, Pickford and Richarlson. Now the chickens have finally come home to roost onve and for all.\nCongratulations to Moshiri, Kenwright and the other hangers on who have failed Everton so miserably. Now P Off PLEASE !!\n421 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:09:33\nListened on Everton radio- Snodin very critical of the front three especially DCL. How many have we conceded now in the first five minutes of a half- seems we are always vulnerable and surely the experienced players and the manager should be able to sort this out.\nI'm not a fan of changing managers but losing to Bournemouth twice, Wolves,Brighton and Southampton with no win since October, it is hard to see why Frank should be given more time. We are running out of winnable games.\n422 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:09:37\n423 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:09:51\n424 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:09:54\n425 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:10:00\n426 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:10:04\nIf only we'd stuck with Allardyce.\n427 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:10:43\nThat's the only metric worth considering. You need 10 wins to stay up. We are not staying up.\n428 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:11:06\nCurrently we are down and ain't coming back for many many years!\n429 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:11:12\nI agree. There is effort but that is not enough at this level. Fitness, strength, speed, quick thinking, courage and of course skill. Throughout the team we lack all of these qualities. a Few players have one or the other but someone like Davies epitomizes the squad as he lacks all of those traits. Onana has strength, Gray has speed and skill but zero thinking ability. Gordon has courage, Coleman has courage, Tarkokski and Gueye do too but that's it. The team is not fit for purpose. The manager could get more out of them perhaps, but they're just not good enough\n430 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:11:19\n431 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:11:25\n432 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:11:26\n433 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:11:59\nIt's such a joyless, miserable nightmare\nI totally agree with you\nSomething within me would die forever. But I think I'm prepared to let that bit of my life go forever now\n434 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:11:59\n435 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:12:02\n436 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:12:21\nMr Moshiri has one last roll of the dice, he needs to roll it tonight and appoint an experienced manager.\nBetter to try and change it whilst there is a glimmer of an opportunity and fail, than to do nothing at all. At the moment we are sinking like a stone into the abyss.\nMr Moshiri, act, give us a fighting chance.\n437 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:12:53\nIn a normal Club Frank would be sacked, but at Everton there are a lot more than him need sacked.Not a great situation.\n438 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:13:25\n439 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:13:49\n440 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:13:50\n441 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:14:17\n442 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:15:47\nShould have got rid before the World Cup but we've now wasted 2 months and games against teams at the bottom.\nLosing to Wolves and Southampton and getting spanked at home by Brighton. FFS how much more dithering is going to be done.\nSack the manager and bring someone in before West Ham.\n443 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:15:55\n444 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:15:59\n445 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:16:11\nAnd that new contract for Iwobi? Please cancel those negotiations, he's not worth it. A measure of how deep in the shit we are, is that we consider Iwobi our playmaker and one of our best players. He did nothing today and haven't for the last ten games. Get rid, and get a playmaker in that can dictate the game and pass to a blue shirt. He needs forty touches to control the ball, and always ends up losing it or misplacing the pass...\n446 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:16:12\n447 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:16:17\nI wish I could hate them.\nI can't.\n449 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:17:37\n450 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:17:41\n451 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:17:49\nJust please fuck off\n452 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:18:25\n453 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:18:36\n454 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:18:40\n455 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:19:16\n456 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:19:20\n457 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:19:38\nHe's a far better manager than Lampard will ever be.\nThe board is totally inept but even they don't want to get relegated.\nDyche will come in\n458 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:19:50\n459 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:19:54\n460 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:20:36\n461 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:20:47\n462 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:21:05\n463 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:21:14\n464 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:21:35\nGordon was an utter disaster, Gueye looked as though he was waiting for instructions to start playing.\nFrankly, if we could get 2 million forany of these useless bollard it would be theft.\n465 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:21:55\n466 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:22:07\n467 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:22:57\nCan't take this on the chin forever...\nEnough\nSomeone has to walk\nSomeone has to take control\nSomeone has to stand up, is it just the fans that do that, or will the club find it in themselves...\n468 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:23:21\n469 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:23:27\n470 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:23:39\nBring in Dyche until end of the season, with an extension if we stay up?\n471 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:24:10\n472 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:24:47\nTuchel, Pochettino, etc but not Moyes, not Fat Sam\nWe have enough games to stay up but Frank continues to wait for DCL to come good and that is not happening and Frank needs to fucking wake up and say to the board \"get rid of my bench and give me a goalscorer\"\n473 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:24:52\n474 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:24:53\nWe need a manager to come in and get an immediate reaction from this squad if we have any chance of staying in this league.\nThe problems we have at this club are beyond Frank Lampard. The demise of this club sits with that clown, Bill Kenwright.\n475 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:25:10\n476 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:25:25\nAll I can do is laugh now, it's unbelievable isn't it.\n477 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:26:47\nI don't like sacking managers like underpanties like we do. But, Lampard should not have gotten the job in the first place. I can not believe why anyone would think that a manager with a bad track record suddenly would do good with us.\n478 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:26:48\nI could not agree more with you.\n480 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:27:12\nHe can't manage in game. We've been ahead against Wolves and Southampton at home, 2 teams who were rock bottom, and he's conspired to lose both games because he can't positively manage a game to the finish.\n481 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:27:24\n482 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:27:40\n483 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:28:40\n484 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:29:22\n485 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:30:09\nOur last season at Goodison will be in the Championship. Everton that.\n486 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:30:24\nIwobi and Gordon don't deserve new contracts, two lightweights, do they even deserve a place on the bench. I remember one stage we were linked to Everton fan Howe, hindsight a great thing.\n487 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:30:44\n488 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:30:54\nThere is one space left on Kenwrights settee so you can still watch the game when the police advise you not to turn up at the stadium.\n489 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:31:08\nThis one's on Frank again. The players put a shift today in but the tactics are lame. We're dead easy to play against. And Southampton, Wolves et al are rubbish. I cannot say what kind of team we are. We're a horrible mess.\nNo sign of us scoring in open play. If you can't score, you don't win. End of. That was as clear before the season started as it is now. Yeah two stupid avoidable errors. But no creativity, no goals, no managerial tactical intervention and therefore no way back.\nSacking the board will not save us from relegation this year.\nFrank has to go. We need a proven experienced manager with his own support team to avoid relegation. Look at what Emery has done at Villa.\nIf Frank's as decent as he appears to be, he'd walk. But he won't because he's believing his own hype.\nAnd Moshiri won't sack him so soon after backing him.\nWhat a mess.\n490 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:31:26\n491 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:32:01\nWe need a manager who does. Now.\n492 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:32:25\n493 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:33:04\nLampard to the end of the season then a proven manager to overhaul the squad ready for the championship (although Burnley have done well with a newcomer). Whoever it's is, we'll need a forest level clear out of playing staff.\nAs for the board? I couldn't care less. They've bought players and built a stadium. They've done their bit. It's the manager and playing staff I want to see overhauled.\n494 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:34:20\n495 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:34:28\nLast match nail biting involving shipping out to non-english speaking countries to avoid news (yes I've done that) will be a distant memory. What a bizarre little circus this tortuous club has become.\n496 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:35:08\nAt this stage, a very ominous formation of the bottom 3.\n497 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:35:29\nThis team is one dimensional and too limited for this league..\n498 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:35:31\nMaybe that's what the board meant when they said we wouldn't have a repeat of last season's last gasp survival. This year we will be done long beforehand.\n499 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:36:15\nI think Dyche made it pretty good with the tools he had at hand at Burnley. Similar type of team as we are now.\nRooney - bad trackrecord\nMoyes - no he blew his carree when he went to Man U),\nBielsa - if him we need him for a couple of years. He is supposed to be a genius, but why did Leeds fall apart under him?\nKlopp - ofcourse but he will never come here\nI don't know really who would like to come here. What options do we have?\n500 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:36:23\n501 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:37:24\n502 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:37:31\n503 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:37:33\nAlan Corken\n122 Posted 05/07/2022 atThere are a lot of others I would like to see leaving before Dunc. The entire board are top of the list followed by each and every one of the management team, let's face it Frank is bang average at best, then there is Ashley Cole...really? Oh, and it goes without saying that the majority of the playing staff need to go. And while I'm at it, the maintenance staff should go too because the stadium is a bloody disgrace!\n504 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:37:44\nFrank has failed to get any more out of them tactically and that's why we are doomed.\nAbility wise I would say this is up there with the worst Everton team I've ever seen.\nDCL is bang average at best. What's this leaping in the air shit ? He's so out of time with them that it's comical. Gray is probably our best player but he was woeful tonight. Iwobi ! I'm lost for words how poor he is and I was thinking there's a player in there somewhere. Fucking hopeless. Mykolenko is not good enough and then we've got the shambles of a defense including Pickford for that free kick. Only Onana showed up today.\nSo that's it. We are down barring a Joe Royle type miracle. Best we can hope for is a buyout of the club and a total clear out from top to bottom.\nBy the way if Kenwright wants to visit Goodison again I suggest we rebuild the boys pen and he can stand in there safely on his own and feel right where he belongs.\n505 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:38:28\nI never wanted Moyes back. I've said it more than a few times, he's the minimum benchmark of a manager.\nBut sadly, we have brought in several lesser managers and the proof is in the squad.\nBut it's mid-season, no money to spend or much time to organise a team. Moyes is the answer because of the past poor decisions and position we find ourselves in.\nSorry but an over-achieving mid-table manager is far better than relegation fodder. At least we had a taste of moderate success.\nI know West Ham are currently below us but at least Moyes knows what needs to be done. Moyes would and should be welcomed back.\nWe need a manager that understands the Premier league and how to fix the team on a shoestring. The reset button has been pressed.\nWe stabilise, we build, then we fight.\nNo Sam, Dyche possibly. Who else?\n506 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:38:59\n507 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:39:00\nWe're starting to become obsessed with now playing only one Striker up top. sadly that won't cut it neither, time to play two together and let them develop a partnership eh Frank!\nThe club needs a complete overhaul now...and real leadership finally.\n508 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:39:09\n509 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:40:16\nWhy the hell would Thomas Frank consider leaving an upwardly progressive club in Brentford to join this fuckin circus that is close to closing down now anyway?\nI wouldn't leave Brentford to manage Everton right now and I'm sure you wouldn't either.\nPotter apparently wasn't too keen on the job when we appointed Benitez in 2021, I imagine he'd be even less keen now.\n510 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:40:46\nSpot on\n511 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:41:58\n512 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:42:00\n513 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:42:16\nWe sold Richarlison then fuckin championed keeping the Golden Boy who's actually got more yellow cards than goals in his career to date.\nClass that.\n514 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:42:21\n515 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:43:27\nDele Alli, the gift that keeps on giving\nMaupay, out of his depth, literally\nMcNeill, heading for the Championship where he belongs,\nGarner, Lampard wouldn't start him ( now injured)\nVinagre, has he left yet ?\nNone of these started today and probably wouldn't even if fit.\nHow's that for team building.\nMoshiri is between a rock and a hard place.\n516 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:43:34\n517 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:43:48\n518 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:44:32\n519 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:44:35\nIf I was Frank I would resign and take his entourage with him, immediately, and leave this board in the mess they deserve to be in.\nMagnificant Fans let down by Donkeys.\n520 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:45:35\nThe little self quote you added is probably the most toe curling thing I have ever read on this site.\nBut, here's what you want Alan.YOU WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG.

Appoint a new Board who must quickly identify a young manager with proven ideas to get us out the championship. No Fireman Sam or Sean.\nFirst thing the new chairman does acknowledge that we may go into the championship but the board and management has a five year plan to turn round the club. Today saw the end of quick solutions.\n524 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:46:36\nI can make that that decision for for myself.\nI'll be be be there next weekend at West Ham. I hope hope you are Shithouses\n525 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:46:37\n526 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:47:10\n527 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:47:24\n528 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:47:51\n529 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:49:14\nThe Academy hasn't produced anything and sometimes I think the idiots running the Club are more interested in eitc.\nEither we look long term and maybe go down and give Lampard time or we keep sacking managers that leads to the Championship anyway.\nEvery other Prem team has either a way of getting results or some quality players that give them a chance of picking up points, I just don't see that with this squad and there are so.e poor sides in this league.\n530 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:49:35\n531 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:49:57\n532 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:51:33\nHere is the reality check I put to my Evertonian friend earlier. We played the bottom club at HOME, we had to play 5 at the back in order not to look like a leaky pile of piss as we did against Brighton. We even managed to play quite well, yet we STILL lost. We are a basket case of a club heading in one direction only.\nI for one am praying Moyes gets sacked this week, maybe, just maybe some of our more entitled, blind and negative fans can see what was clear for most of Moyes tenure here, he did a REALLY good job with buttons to spend. Maybe, just maybe he will get the respect he deserved the first time around. Discuss.\n533 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:54:23\nThe main reason why I think we are in trouble is not that we lost. BUt that I think the board will sack Lampard. The bile, the spite, the fury towards them will leave them no choice but to sack him, to save themselves. (They wont sack themselves). Mosh will try and sell us. (hes trying to anyway - cant say I blame him tbh.)\nWe'll lurch to another manager - it should be someone that the Director of Football hires. BUt it wont be. No clear evidence of coherence from the board. So it will be Dyche, (the pragmatic shot) or someone like Ancellotti again (the glamour shot), or even Moyes (the desperate shot) but it doesnt matter who it is. Neither can get our team playing successfully - We arent a dyche (pragmatic) team. Our best (most valuable ?) players look to play thru teams (as theyve been coached to do, as the crowd has demanded) whereas Dyche plays around and over teams. And the Ancelotti style, our players arent good enough to play like that. As for Moyes. I don't know anymore. I don't know anything anymore.\nExcept that we have to play our way out of this. And to do that, we cant start again with another manager. We have to stick to what we have, try and get better individually and as a team, and a club. And we cant do that by starting again. Its too late. We have too many players who have a contract that other teams wont honour, and therefore buy. We don't have any money to buy the players that the next manager will want/insist on. And, from the evidence from the comments on TW, a very divided fanbase that therefore cannot be unified, happy, no matter what the board, owner and manager does. Let alone the players.\n534 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:54:28\n535 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:54:39\nThat's football though. If you make mistakes you concede and therefore you lose deservedly so.\n536 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:54:48\nNot sure if that was tongue in cheek jest but bringing back Moyes would be pure suicide.\nIt's like expecting something that worked in 1987 to have worked in 2003.\nMoyes era has sailed now, he was a decent manager in a different climate but it looks like he'll be sacked at West Ham soon himself so there's no way we will go for him.\nRooney would be another Lampard appointment, couple of fist pumping displays but lacking in any real managerial experience would kill him at this club.\nFerguson exactly the same, I have not seen a host of clubs banging his door down since he left us last year?\n537 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:56:45\n539 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:57:36\nFrank, please resign and give us hope!\nAre the board aware what relegation could mean? Please call some ex premiership clubs in the championship or league one!\n540 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:58:02\nEvertonians screaming in each others faces. How the fuck did it get to this ?\nSOS TO DUNCAN FERGUSON !!!!!\nThis club is shattered into so may different fragments. All the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt put it back together again.\nI'm sick of the football experts shouting the the call for Ferguson down... They've had their wish. Time and Time again. This is what it looks like\n541 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:58:03\n542 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:58:09\n543 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:59:05\n544 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:59:29\nMike Hughes - it would be great to see Ferguson and all the passion !!!!\n545 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:59:34\n546 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:59:42\nHe is the weak link in our defence and Che Adams won absolutely every header against him.\nThis side is destined for championship next season and I can't see and quick way back.\n547 Posted 14/01/2023 at 17:59:52\n548 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:01:51\nOur only chance of staying up is for some inspiration and tactics to suit the game we're playing.\nFrank has shown himself to be totally lacking in this regard.\nThe only two players who showed some fight today were cases us and Onana. If the rest had shown the same commitment and determination we would have won.\n549 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:02:47\nWho is that strange post aimed at? We're all good Blues on here and some of us have been supporting the club home and away for many more years than you.\n550 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:04:32\n551 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:05:21\nGoing down. An accumulation of appalling signings that have squandered 𧼐M plus.\nMoshiri has shown he should be nowhere near a football club.\n552 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:06:44\nMay Almighty God have mercy on you, and having forgiven your sins, lead you to eternal life.\n553 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:08:24\nUnable to spend funds, if they are even available, to improve the team or replace the manager. We should be preparing to achieve promotion from the Championship next season.\n554 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:08:31\nAs I have posted a few times prior, you cannot run a football team without a decent forward line â€“ for obvious reasons. This manager is clueless as is the board and unfortunately have cemented our fate â€“ 100% their fault.\nWhat amazes me is why every other club find a player or two and we find no one â€“ maybe this is our cancer. EFC clearly stick to the policy of playing by wage, as in the Walter Smith days â€“ look where that got us?\nBleak days ever since, but then our U23 team wins the Premier League 2 How? Where are they now?\nApart from the crass embarrassment of getting slaughtered twice by Bournemouth earlier this season, Lampard has got to be fired over his handling of Simms. He brings him back from Sunderland and then puts him on the pitch after 88 minutes, when we are 1-4 down â€“ did he forget he was back and sitting behind him?\nAnyway another few Sam Miguel's might quieten me... doubt it !!\n555 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:10:22\n558 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:13:50\nI'm convinced this board has planned for us to go down, if Frank stays on till we are relegated & continues as manager, he's part of that plan.\nMaybe this wipes out the P&S rules when you drop into the Championship? They will get the parachute payment, slate wiped clean & we start again.\nGod knows how my thinking has led me to this! That's modern-day Everton for you. What a tragic mess.\nMy head is fucked.\n559 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:14:55\n560 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:15:41\n561 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:16:56\n\"I'm sick of the football experts shouting the call for Ferguson down... They've had their wish. Time and Time again. This is what it looks like\"\nWhat a silly and baseless statement. You can say that about any manager who has never been appointed.\n562 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:17:36\n563 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:18:15\nSack Lampard? Moshiri can't afford it. We're fooked then end of story!\nOnly consolation Moshiri will have lost a cool £billion by backing Kenwright. Wonder if has any regrets?\n564 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:18:26\nInteresting times. I almost want Frank to stay and then to see Moshiri forced to pull the trigger and choke on his own words and say \"This sacking was my doing\".\nStand up and be counted, you clueless owner!\n565 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:19:11\nA team that regularly gets beat by the bottom two clubs in the Premier League would struggle in the Championship.\nWe have to back NSNOW to try do get something done about this disastrous off-field management of the club or Everton will sink to god knows where in the Football League.\nI am too old to go to a disco with the team, like my friend, a Burnley supporter, did when they where in the Third Division.\nFrank has to go to try to avoid relegation now and a manager who managed a promoted side needs to be brought in to scrap a way out of this mess in the meantime. Need a few hardened pros, preferably hard men, to shore up the team as well.\nIt really is serious now. The Board will probably not attend matches, which would be a good thing; leave the match days to people who know.\n566 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:19:40\nI cant be bothered to look up Lampards stats but I doubt very much if his record with Everton is as good as those that have already been fired.\nI am all for given chances to coaches or managers but you can only give a manager so long to see he is not suitable, and I am sorry but Lampard simply proves that he is not at Premiership standard and is learning nothing. We took a chance but it is not working.\nMajor Problem is who do you get to take over a poison chalice ? Another learner, Rooney, Ferguson, a firefighter, Fat Sam, Dyche, or an experience, Tuchel, Pott, or in house..\nI don't think it will be hard to get another manager who will just want a big pay day for six months we need a builder, and that is the hard choice, used to winning but will have to realize it may include a season in the Championship.\nAnd there is no such thing that a team is to good to go down.\n567 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:20:01\nI think Lampard will be given the West Ham game. Remember Moshiri's statement earlier this week:\n“I think you have got to stay with the manager to get the systems going, the players he brought in. I have a lot of faith in Frank that he will get it right.â€\n“You can't just make rash decisions. We have two big games, Saturday, and on the 21st (against West Ham), and that is the only focus.â€\n568 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:20:46\nThis one is on Frank as it's not getting any better and he had 6 weeks of the World Cup to sort it.\nWe are all over the place defensively and unable to score goals.\n569 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:21:30\nThe division is still wide open at the bottom, we can still stay up if we can find 2 or 3 players that we need.\nAlthough I'm not just blaming Frank for the state we are in, I think we do need a new face in charge to try and kick-start the season again.\nWe have to find a couple of players that will make a difference because, if we don't, its looking hopeless.\nI'm sure they are looking very hard to find those players; if they have to pay over the odds for them, that's what they will have to do,\n570 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:25:31\nAs soon as a worse manager is available then the Board will sack him.\n571 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:28:23\nWatching Calvert-Lewin fail to get to anything in the air cost us the game.\nGray's decision-making cost us the game.\nNot putting a man on the post against Ward-Prowse...\n572 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:32:26\nAs you mentioned Pat - West Ham it is.\n573 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:32:38\nSeamus (4) - was utterly goosed by 50 mins. What the fuck are we playing a man of his age as a flying wingback???\nGodfrey (5) - best defender.\nCoady (2) - the most over-rated player by our own fans we've ever had. More so than Ounar Niasse. Slow and shouty. Nothing else.\nTarkowski (1) - I apologise to Connor for my comment aboveâ€¦.targeted by Adams and Southampton on deck and floor, and for good reason. An utter tortoise.\nMykolenko (2) - a nothing footballer. Greyer than Frank. Offers little at either end.\nGana (5) - desperately trying, but not sure he has what he had anymore. Like Coleman, I'll never slag him, but we need more finesse here.\nOnana (7) - for me the only one on the Everton team who looks like a Premier League player. Not sure if that's him or them, but still not bad.\nIwobi (5) - wide of the postâ€¦ .a statement that sums him up. He's also usually wide of the tackle too. Great haircut tho.\nGray (5) - teams cotton on that if they stop him we have nothing. Some giveaways and shite deliveries but should not be ashamed.\nCalvert-Lewin (4) - should be nothing more than an impact sub, keep asking him to keep 34 times a game against two CBs and only a matter of time before he breaks down for good.\nGordon only sub I'm mentioning and the score here is minus 33â€¦..why can't he head a pass 5 yards? Even worse, why can't he kick a pass 5 yards? Contract situation maybe, but this boy should not be on pitch ahead of Simms.\nWe are in all kinds of shit. Fans singing “you're not fit to wear the shirtâ€ at the players and the massive “Fuck off right nowâ€ volley against Pickford and Coady when they stupidly tried to come over and clapâ€¦ I don't understand why it's the board and the players alone, and they aren't singing for Frank to go??\nThis is the season it all goes tits up. We are going down. There's NOTHING positive to look at. Too late for a new manager, kids banished, fans had enough, inept board, DoF who replaced a defence with like for like and kept the old one too for spares. WTF.\nGet Dyche or Nuno in now (we need a championship manager!), and start doing everything to bounce back up from that championship in one year. No other option. Forget Rooney, forget Ferguson, we'll get 3 games of passion and then wilt. We need to build to survive.\nSo, so gutted today. Not even angry. Just feel sick. Physically sick.\n574 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:33:00\nI back Frank but my problem is who sanctioned 㿍M on McNeil and Maupay? That was shooting yourself in the foot with a massive shotgun and it wasn't like we had loads of cash to spend.\n575 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:34:06\nHalfway through the season and three wins out of nineteen tells its own story. The board knew, in the summer of 2021, that Richarlison was going and we still haven't signed an adequate replacement so we all knew the side was always going to struggle for goals and the problems start right at the top.\nHaving said that, the manager selects the side, the tactics and decides the subs. Lampard has proved inept in every aspect.\nTo stand any chance of surviving we need a change and we need it now. To do nothing is suicide.\n576 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:35:12\nIt's tight at the bottom, but it looks like us and two from five others to go down.\nTo be brutally honest, I think I'd rather watch us competing in the Championship than witness this miserable showing week after week in the top flight.\n577 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:35:15\nI think Danny O' was referencing the team, not the supporters.\n578 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:39:23\nI'd also like to add to my post that I understand entirely why Danny posted as he did; my pompous comment was unnecessary.\nWe can stay up, we really can. Let's stick together and infuriate our enemies. Everything is to play for.\nI agree that Lampard will be given West Ham and I still think he might do this for us. If not, sorry Darren and others: not Ferguson and not Baines (interesting, but he never truly believed in himself) ; Dyche, if we want to survive and then build. I think he might surprise us.\n579 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:39:57\n580 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:44:10\n581 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:46:24\nSo that leaves Bournemouth, Southampton and Leeds as well as ourselves to slug it out, perhaps Forest if they get dragged back in.\nOf those teams, we are the worst because we have the least firepower. So, unless we make a Kevin Campbell type signing plus a creative midfielder, we're gone, I'm afraid.\nHow did the management and recruitment staff not realise this when Richarlison was sold? I rarely want a manager to be sacked but perhaps Frank's dismissal is the last throw of the dice?\nI certainly don't understand his selections and substitutions any more although I doubt any other manager could get this lot to play any better.\nI'm actually resigned to seeing relegation after 61 years following the club. The euphoria of the Palace game may yet prove futile. I'm resigned - sadly the whole crowd appears to feel that way too.\n582 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:46:56\nComing on and demonstrating a complete lack of knowledge of the game by spending 5 years attacking Tom Davies and blaming him for all the club's problems whilst it is in complete turmoil.\nI thought that seeing as Tom Davies didn't play any part of the game, he wouldn't warrant a mention. I really should have known better. Along comes Kieran and of course he was the first player he mentioned..... Yet again!!!\nThere's opinion then there's obsession. No time for the latter.\nGet Ferguson in before it's too late!\n583 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:49:43\nBut we had an absentee Board today in a physical sense but really we have had an absentee Board for years so they'll sit on their hands and wait a while longer before having to actually decide something.\n584 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:51:44\nHere's a very frightening thought, even the lost soul, distracted, Dele Alli could offer something creative from the bench ahead of these two.\nToo many diabolical decisions have caught up with us, each one a new lead weight on the shoulders of the club. The great club has soldiered on limping and sweating but finally buckled under the load.\nNot Amadou Onana, who was one of the two best players on the pitch today along with Ward-Prowse.\nA new manager may not succeed but the evidence is now overwhelming, surely now Moshiri has to act and get an experienced manager in tomorrow or Monday. He has to try something to stop the rot. There's no time to lose.\n585 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:55:55\nYou criticise a poster's obsession with Tom Davies and then propose Ferguson yet again as manager. If that's not obsession, what is?\n586 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:56:12\nLOL. He has no clue as many of us suspected!\n587 Posted 14/01/2023 at 18:56:39\nI disagree with most of your assessments, but I think that we should look at the display in sections rather than individual players.\nPickford - (a department on his own) I'd give a 6 or 7, he stopped a number of very good Soton efforts, and as for the free kick, in the modern game you put a bunch of big bastards in a wall which is supposed to ensure that if the free-kick is too low, it hits them, if it goes over them, it goes over the goal. I thought the ball went through the wall. The goalkeeper covers the 2/3rds of the goal the wall can't manage. When the wall behaves like an alehouse defence, the goalkeeper has no chance.\nDefence - 4. what I noticed was that the defence was repeatedly caught outnumbered by Soton attackers and that the players who should have been smothering the attackers (defensive midfield, anyone) were wandering back from the other half instead of tearing up the turn to provide cover.\nMidfield - 3. Onana excepted they failed to break up attacks, create their own or put the slightest effort into going forward. Some of the backwards passing was of the highest quality, however, and we had so many examples to compare.\nAttack - 0. Calvert-Lewin was like fucking Zebedee. He jumped into the air when the ball was nowhere near, missed everything, got into positions where he was covered by at least two defenders and made sure there was always a defender between him and the ball. He fluffed every situation where he could receive and run with the ball, he couldn't shoot, head or even get his arse in front of the ball.\nGordon was useless. On one run he actually got past the defenders but he might as well have booted the ball out of play directly rather than attempt a cross which hadn't got the slightest chance of getting through. Gray tried quite hard but sadly couldn't produce a worldy on this occasion.\nFinal point â€“ I'm sure Bill and his mates will do the business on Onana soon enough and he'll become as useless as the rest of them.\n588 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:00:34\nt was the fans who helped save Everton last season, but watching something on the internet, the sky presenter Jeff Shreeves, was actually describing it, as being chaotic scenes, outside of Goodison Park, before today's game.\nWhy would he describe a coach welcoming as chaotic? The blame game has already began, and it's absolutely sickening to the core.\nWatching Evertonians during today's sit-in was genuinely heartbreaking especially after watching the team who started okay but could never build up a head of steam because they lacked cohesion.\nWe are a very, very poorly coached and assembled team,and even going back to the basics was hard to watch because the players are lacking so much confidence, they can't even get a lot of the basics right.\nI could go on and criticize them a lot more but it's easy to criticize and I don't like kicking anyone whilst they are down, which is now where Everton appear to be heading unless there are drastic changes right the way through our club.\nNot everything is lost but a lot of the players and our manager are definitely lost, so to hell with your extremely laughable stability principles, Mr Moshiri, because it's unbelievably time for change once again.\n589 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:03:15\nI advocate Ferguson every time there is a managerial crisis, Mainly because I can see the foolishness of the appointments you generally support..\nI do not come on after every single game and mention him. Even when he doesn't play any part in the game... See if you can work out the difference ?\nYou are so adamant you don't want Ferguson mentioned because you don't want to be proven wrong... Bit late for that, lad.\n590 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:04:33\nI assume you mean coax Sir Alex out of retirement rather than the legend in his own lunchtime thug that just failed to get the manager's job at Wigan and has failed to get any job in the last 6 months.\n591 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:06:38\nSo many fans were optimistic about this game. Why? I don't know. It's been obvious from months ago that Frank Lampard isn't up to it. Time to go.\n592 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:09:39\nHonest to God, as soon as Southampton equalized I had the feeling we would lose.\nThey wanted the three points more than us, fuck all to do with bad luck etc, no-one can tell me otherwise.\nThis team has zero confidence, opponents know full well we are so fragile that we are there for the taking.\nIf we have any chance of staying up, we need a bounce and inspiration from someone, and I doubt very much if Lampard can provide this, might be a nice guy but lacks the know-how and above all the ruthlessness required to make it as a top manager, he got very lucky last season.\n593 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:12:06\nAnother typical manager just waiting to be sacked for his severance.\n594 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:13:55\nThey wouldn't have nearly enough games. It's over. We're down.\n595 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:14:11\nGiven the lack of transfers in, P&S rules must be demanding we sell before we buy. So let's sell Gordon who doesn't want to be here anymore. What can we get for him?\nChelsea and Spurs might still be interested so maybe we can get $40 million for him. So we will have some money to play with. What we need is a defensive midfielder who knows the game and a goal scorer who can put the ball in the net.\nWe seem to be at our most vulnerable when we are around our opponent's penalty area as we have attacked with 5 or 6 bodies. Then anyone of those 6 (Onana excepted) lose the ball, we are wide open to a counter attack. No plan, no organization, little desire to chase back.\nSadly Gana is the biggest culprit. Far too many of our so-called attacking players run into blind alleys and look to play the ball back, again Onana excepted. Gray today was a prime example. For every bit of magic, there are 10 times he coughs up the ball.\nWe have 17 days to save ourselves. We have enough games to save ourselves. Lampard in or out? We have to generate funds to buy two players who can give us a chance.\nWhere's Barrie Horne when you need him!\n596 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:18:11\nBelieve me, if he were to be appointed, I would support him and if he did happen to keep us up, I would happily be proved wrong.\nI suspect your use of the term “ladâ€ to address me is a patronising one but it's nice, as a 69-year-old, to be addressed in such youthful terms.\n597 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:21:08\nI know, two different coaches from the opposite sides of the spectrum, but I am desperate!\n598 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:21:12\nIt's possible that Dyche is far too intelligent to work for this lot. If it's a choice between one of Kia's has-beens or /never beens or Ferguson, I'd take Ferguson.\nThis squad shouldn't be in the bottom three. A manager getting the best out of these players would have us higher. The current one has shown he can't do that.\nIn the next week or two, I think we'll realise whether Moshiri's 'faith' is down to the business not being able to afford to sack the current management team, or whether he's once again made himself look foolish.\nDarren, I hope your grandkids are okay.\n599 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:22:15\nSo why aren't we mid-table then?\nI'll tell you why: because we don't score goals and concede alarmingly. Hence that's why we're in the Bottom 3. A truly shocking squad of wage stealers.\n600 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:25:38\nI was surprised by the fouls count with Southampton having 19 and Everton only 7, bookings were 3 yellow for Southampton Everton 0.\nIt shows who were in no mood to lose.\n601 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:26:15\n602 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:28:22\nAnd it's down to the players, nobody else, not the owner, not the board, not the manager, not finch farm, not the tea lady, but, you useless bunch of fucking embarrassing, money grabbing, mollycoddled, tosspots.\nGet your fucking heads out of your arses and do your jobs!!\n[I went to man-management school â€“ but didn't take the exam... ðŸ¤“]\n603 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:28:24\nI get passion. I will show it at the weekend.\nWe all have passion but don't overstep the mark. Abusing players. Kendall must go.\nWe're better than that.\n604 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:29:32\nIt looks like Frank just ain't up to it. “Itâ€ being many things but most importantly he's probably not up to the job currently at hand which is keeping us up.\nI don't agree that we're the worst team in the league in terms of talented players. We're just short in both creativity and goal scoring. Two massive areas.\nI think with a new manager and short sharp deals we could get out of it. But who that manager is I'm not sure. I'm thinking probably Dyche as I can't think of anyone else. He'll most likely know who to bench and who to sign.\nSo get the spray paint out. Dyche in.\n605 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:29:57\nLampard does have to go though. I can't understand how anyone thinks otherwise. He has shown nothing in management, either here or elsewhere.\n606 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:32:27\nFor years under Martinez, Koeman, Silva and Carlo, I was accused of being a happy clapper. Big Sam and Benitez drained me and now Frank has finally destroyed my belief and faith in our club.\nI wish I had an ounce of your optimism but I can't find it anymore. Sad times indeed.\n607 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:36:53\nAlso some action in the market: Gordon to whoever will buy him and sign a forward with a record of scoring, plus a midfielder who can pass, on loan if necessary.\nIf nothing is done, we are down. Can anyone see us winning seven games in our current state?\n608 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:37:31\n609 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:46:25\nExcept that every time we have appointed a manager instead of DF it has ended worse than the time before.\nHe may turn out to be crap, but he is unlikely to be as a scrap as those who were given the gig.\nLoved Baines, but he couldnt even stand up for himself when people pushed him off free kicks and pen's. How`s he going to run the team ?\nI think the whole place needs unifying and if you think there is somebody more likely to do that. I would like to know who it is.\nI cant have Ian Edwards dismissing him - Especially as he has spent so long apologising for Benitez and The Knight King.\nHow bad does it have to get before people realise these fucking mercenaries are NOT the answer.\nPaul\nThe Grand kids are from your old haunt, Crosby. Not what you want them to see, but they fucking loved it. Had to literally drag them away\n610 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:51:23\nMaupay and McNeil have underwhelmed, and Gueye isn't the player he was. Gordon has turned out to be a false hope.\nOur players are the real problem.\n611 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:51:26\nBooing after watching unadulterated, effortless shite, is toxic? It's not something I've ever done, but some people cannot contain their exasperation, so they are labeled toxic.\nLampard needs to go, but I don't know how anyone from this absolutely shameless board can have the temerity to sack him, when they couldn't even look a very loyal fanbase, who are the lifeblood of our football club, in the eyes today.\nIt has unfortunately now become just Us, us, us, us, us and Them, them, them, them, them.\n612 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:52:06\n613 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:53:49\n614 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:55:24\nHe should take over next season when we are in the Championship and lead us back up.\n615 Posted 14/01/2023 at 19:56:11\nI think I was more traumatised than they were, Paul.\nI'm going to have to pour meself a Mahatma and watch the 14th showing of this week's Midsummer Murders to recover!\n616 Posted 14/01/2023 at 20:11:08\nFeel better already!\n617 Posted 14/01/2023 at 20:29:18\n618 Posted 14/01/2023 at 20:38:51\n619 Posted 14/01/2023 at 20:39:48\nAnd at how those supposedly in charge of it have disgraced themselves by trying to shift attention onto the one good thing about it, the supporters.\n620 Posted 14/01/2023 at 20:40:22\n1. I'll say it after every match - the club should have sold Gordon in August when Chelsea came calling. He's a garbage player who only looked half-decent to some supporters because of where he was born.\n2. People calling for the likes of Duncan Ferguson to be manager is like the rehashed mullet hairdo - it's a great way to judge someone's lack of intelligence very quickly.\n3. Quite a few saying the fans dragged the side to safety last season. Now, as with every statement, it's either true or false. If it's true, why didn't the all powerful fans drag the team to better places earlier, before relegation was a strong possibility? Why are those same all powerful fans not working their magic now whilst the club is losing to bottom clubs? Could it be that it's a load of shite and the Goodison crowd isn't as magical as they think they are? I know the supporters are sick and tired of being screwed over by the club, but that doesn't mean they're something they're not.\n4. After today's unfoldings, surely the board are now aware that their position is untenable. It's wishful thinking to hope they do the right thing but you can't be warned by security to stay home and still think you're wanted at the club.\n622 Posted 14/01/2023 at 20:55:12\n623 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:00:13\nLook folks,this isn't going away this time- Everton are being relegated.\nInstead of being swayed by emotion and a sense of loyalty-which I completely understand by the way- let's think sensibly and rationally.\nThe Owner wants conflict as it will suit the Kenwright rhetoric that he is being fed. They can and will blame the fans,given the ammunition,and once again get off scot free.\nIf Moshiri wants to play it the Kenwright way,then great ok- but he is forgetting one vital thing- no fans in Goodison until next season will result in a complete capitulation of his club. Why?\nEverton get paid huge sums of money by Sky to televise their matches- let's call it Sky's Product. This product is beamed worldwide to billions for a fee. When Goodison remains empty for weeks on end,Sky will in the 1st instance seek answers from the Premier League on why their product is being tainted by a lack of fans at Everton matches,which makes it less saleable. The Premier League will seek answers from Kenwright-and what can he say? There has been no trouble, no violence in or around Goodison- just a respectful withdrawal of support by its fan base without demands or threats.\nKenwright will have no viable excuse so the club will be fined /points deduction by the Premier League for not meeting it requirements. This is only the start. Sky will follow suit and withdraw monies from next seasons payment to Everton for breach of contract- failure to meet your contractual agreement Mr Moshiri- full stadiums to go with \"Our Product \". Your club is damaging \"Our Product \" by having no atmosphere in your ground because you have no fans. This means Sky's profits are being affected. Think back to when Covid hit, Sky nearly went under because their \"Product\" became spectator less and it hit them hard. The games were rubbish to watch without spectators- we all said it was the 'forgotten season'.\nThis will escalate quickly once Sky start to protect \"Their Product \" and before long the fines will stack up, the FA will get involved with punitive measures and if no resolution is forthcoming then Uefa will demand answers from Moshiri and more punitive measures be put in place. He might be a wealthy accountant, but the shit he won't need, and Kenwright will have jumped ship long ago,citing illness no doubt. How are Everton going to survive in The Championship with a much reduced balloon payment? Moshiri isn't putting money in again. His business will get asset stripped of players at such low fees he is staring at even more massive loss. Who's going to buy a shit show like that Mr Moshiri?\nAnd all the time, we as the fans never respond to the clubs plea's for answers on non attendance. They know what the fans want- this Board out-but we as the fans have to take the moral high ground and remain silent until Kenwright has gone and taken his lackeys with him.\nNobody likes being ignored-especially egomaniacs like Kenwright.\nA dignified non attendance for 6 months and this club will change forever.\nI am nearly 9 year's in and counting by the way. Yes,it's only football you say,but the actions of this clubs Board over this last week has now made it personal-and you must stand up for yourself and protect your beliefs.\n624 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:03:21\nAnyway, the board thinks and tells the world and his mother we are a bunch of neanderthals.\nThe owner tells the World and his mother, we, the fans, wanted all the managers sacking.\nThe media think BK is much maligned, though possibly, very belatedly, the penny is finally dropping.\nWe are finished, as I cannot see those players getting the requisite points to save us.\n625 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:05:08\nAll the above watched by a manager who has got progressively worse as the season has got to halfway, with all the poor performances right in front of him he made one change which probably cost us any chance of winning and another with nine minutes to go, that is really poor management, unforgivable but he looks like he will be asked to carry on because there was nobody from people who run the club there today to do anything and when they are there they do nothing but watch the rubbish being served and make no attempt to alter this sad and pathetic state the club is in.\nThe club is sinking fast with no lifeboats for any of us, we are all going down together with Mount Everest in front of us, it's going to be a long climb back up.\n626 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:05:30\nClub's history since then. The match was partly responsible because if\nSouthampton had had some decent forward players(Ward Prowse excepted)\nthey would have scored five.\nThe worst thing however was the Board's decision to brand its own supporters\nas being capable of causing physical harm to them. The PR effect is catastrophic\nfor Everton FC. I actually think that after that decision they deserve whatever they\nget.\n627 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:05:45\n628 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:05:46\n629 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:08:48\n630 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:24:11\nThis is a joke. Lampard should never have been appointed, he should have been sacked after the bournemouth games, definitely after Wolves, more definitely after Brighton. How the hell can you keep him now? It is the most bizarre thing I have ever know by far.\nA monkey would do better.\nJust sack the useless fool and the next manager must sign a contract that stipulates that the ridiculous 433, 352, 532 formations will never ever be considered.\nThey are a joke, this is a joke. Act now Moshiri FFS\n631 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:27:09\nThe club is rotten from top to bottom. Board, Management and Players. We are going down.\n632 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:28:16\n633 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:31:38\nAnd Gordon should be fined for giving that idiotic foul away and giving their free kick taker the opportunity to score in one of the few avenues they have.\n634 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:33:24\n635 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:36:29\nIt may well be a lot longer than that most of the current team will be gone and there will be almost nothing coming in ( we would have to lose 50% of wages)\nWe will have kids.\nThe Championship is not a walk in the Park by any means.\nLook at Sunderland.\nOnana will not want to play there, neither DCL or Gray.\n636 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:37:33\n637 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:39:39\n638 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:41:34\n639 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:43:02\nI certainly think Frank is, with a fair wind and the necessary slice of luck, capable of turning things around if he is given sufficient funding to bring in a couple of decent strikers of his choice [ not Thelwell's] in what remains of the transfer window. The Director of Football position must be consigned to the dustbin as it's been an unmitigated disaster since Moshiri originally insisted on it. Neither the current incumbent nor his two predecessors have shown themselves remotely competent at identifying players capable of improving the squad.\nJim Bennings #513 makes an extremely valid point; why was Richarlison not held to [I think] the final year of his contract and instead Gordon sold for the ludicrously generous fee which several misguided potential suitors were reputedly willing to pay ? Surely it would have been eminently sensible to risk loosing a proven goal scorer for nothing a year later rather than sell him for a relatively modest 㿨m. The fee realised is absolute peanuts in relation to the potential financial consequences of relegation. Whoever sanctioned the sale of Richarlison should hang his or her head in shame.\nThere are still almost 60 points to play for. I don't want to hear nonsensical statements from players acknowledging their poor performances and following up with the usual platitudes about their responsibilities etc. Instead I want to see them playing their hearts out to ensure that the team that has spent the longest of all clubs in the top echelon of English football remains there !!\n640 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:43:31\n641 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:45:38\nIt'll get much worse before it gets better\n642 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:46:37\n643 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:48:36\nI don't blame any single individual for this...\nBut there are a few individuals who cannot deflect scrutiny or criticism..\nTime to make changes even if those individuals remain stoic and un apologetic...\nThe fans deserve better than this.\nThe board were advised not to turn up, who is pulling the strings then, when will these puppets have their strings cut.\nShameful, hollow,shallow,and not fit.\nThe players are not to blame, not the fans, I think we can all see the problem,so Mr moshiri Mr kenwright, show some true leadership and do the right thing,\n644 Posted 14/01/2023 at 21:49:28\nDCL doesn't want to play in the Premier league.\n645 Posted 14/01/2023 at 22:00:49\nCrisis means low prices. Keep the pressure on Moshiri and the Board. Get the disgusting wasters out and get the owner (Usmanov's bagman) to take a hit.\nEvery cloud.\n646 Posted 14/01/2023 at 22:04:01\n647 Posted 14/01/2023 at 22:04:09\n648 Posted 14/01/2023 at 22:09:53\n649 Posted 14/01/2023 at 22:10:33\nWhat happens on the pitch is the coach / managers responsibly.\nI seen a team, that are very, very badly coached.\nNever in all my 50 years watching the blues, did I expect to see a flat midfield. Totally inline with each other. Not corresponding with each other whatsoever. No inter action with each other, Embarrassing.\nI'll cut to the chase.\nFuck off Lampard. Take Edwards with you. Especially, that Dud Paul Clement, with you.\nSave us Frank. By going now. Theirs a seat waiting for you by Jamie Redknapp. Another who talks the talk.\nUTFT.\n650 Posted 14/01/2023 at 22:14:38\n651 Posted 14/01/2023 at 22:21:49\nToday is about as low as I've felt in more than fifty years a Blue. We've all got our thoughts on what's wrong and I'm done with arguing with Blues I disagree with. Let this be our lowest day.\nBe it Dyche(I wish) or Lampard or whoever, we can not get any worse. We can stay up, we must, we will.\n652 Posted 14/01/2023 at 22:37:44\nAnd by the way Pat is right when he says Sky don't give a flying one about Everton they're inconsequential. A shabby little club playing in a shabby ground run by shabby men and a woman.\n653 Posted 14/01/2023 at 22:44:34\nI agree the negativity needs to stop, but the reality also has to set in. The situation cannot be retrieved in all likelihood. It's time we all adjusted to that fact.\n654 Posted 14/01/2023 at 22:47:24\n655 Posted 14/01/2023 at 22:48:26\nThe stats back it up.\nHis failure to change tactics back it up.\nHis lack of coaching or tactical nous back it up.\nHe will relegate us.\nThe board are incidental, at this point.\nIt is a crime that he was not sacked in November after the Bournemouth games.\nHe is hopeless, and every day that inept, empty-headed fuck of an owner vacillating on saving his investment by hiring a competent manager, our position becomes scarier.\nWe won't come back if we're relegated.\nOur financial position is apocalyptic.\nIf Lampard had a shred of integrity, he'd resign. He, and the board (to a far great extent) are killing us.\n656 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:00:08\nI've really, really wanted Frank to succeed but it's not going to happen. We need to cut our losses and get shut now. I have no idea who could come in and save us although I do know that whoever it is, it won't be pretty. The basics today were appalling, we do have some decent players, they have no idea what their role is supposed to be.\nLots of change required with the immediate one being Frank and his team - time is up.\n657 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:01:33\nBut this time I actually believe that this is what the club really need. We will still get premiership money for 2seasons ( I think) and it could just be the catalyst for mosh to sell and kenwright to walk away. But you know what I'll watch them in any division and give RM shit when bad and cheer when good COYB.\n658 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:01:51\n659 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:07:39\nDenise started chatting her shit after the Brighton game apparently and according to witnesses was put in a headlock for her own protection.\n660 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:08:36\nWe need a short term boost, something to remove the stench of fear, relegation, defeatism and acceptance.\nI fear that today will have been irreversibly traumatic for this group of players and their coach.\nHis resignation is the greatest thing he can do for our club. Still, we've got time. We can start today.\n661 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:09:58\n662 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:10:05\nI've supported Frank, naively thinking with his lineage, intelligence and career that he could be a success. But while the players are poor they're getting worse Coady and Tark are OK old fashioned CBs but increasingly exposed by how we play. I don't understand the midfield game plan. There's no plan A much less B. We send out the same aimless bunch in the same aimless way every week. I don't know with this squad and no money if anyone can save us. But I can't see Frank doing so.\n663 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:12:23\nI sort of feel the same. Tried to get excited for the game but by the end I just felt empty. It's very sad\n664 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:12:53\n665 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:13:10\nIt was mentioned on MOTD so I asked.\nThank you Kevin.\n666 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:13:34\n667 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:16:03\n668 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:16:08\nThe board are out of touch with reality and so is anyone who feels Lampard is not partly to blame.\nThe team lacks confidence even when they scored first yet again as Soton still looked stronger where it\nmattered.\nAs son as the commentator said that Soton hadn't won at Goodison since the year dot I just knew we were doomed.\nNot surprisingly It was Ward-Prowse who stuck it to us once again.\nThe whole team is a mess.\nGray started out brightly and looked dangerous but faded again too soon but I cannot understand why we cannot defend when we have five experienced defenders at the back.\nWe used to blame Mina and Keane then Holgate but those we have now are not good enough.\nSomebody is to blame for these signings and if not Lampard then the whole scouting staff.\nThey all should be fired right now.\nI have been a fan for 70 years but this is the worst squad I have ever been ashamed of.\n669 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:18:04\n670 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:19:02\n671 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:21:55\n672 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:23:06\n673 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:23:54\n674 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:27:55\nParachute payment year one equals 55 percent of what other prem teams get, 40 percent year two, 20 percent year three. That equates to about 35 million less income next year from TV money in addition to lost ticket income and prize money plus potentially cup tv money not to mention impact on sponsorships. So there's nothing good there. Imagine if we lock in Iwobi and Gordon on new deals then two years from now are at BM getting 20 percent of the tv money? We will go bust.\n675 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:29:17\n676 Posted 14/01/2023 at 23:37:48\nI have a ticket for West Ham and will give a 100% as always, I just wish I could expect the same from the players and coaching staff. We have to make a change before transfer is closed, Jesus I would even welcome Fat Sam at this point, mind you, I am most of the way through my second bottle of red.\nSack the board, Frank out, fuck the lot of them!!!!\nUTFT!\n677 Posted 14/01/2023 at 00:01:45\nPaul#670\nMaybe their are a few idiots but what you say is right.This whole non attendance of the Board and leaking of this ,with Moshiriblaming the Fan for so many Managers all sounds like self serving spin..\n678 Posted 14/01/2023 at 00:02:39\nAnd as for the present manager, he's not fit to stir Big Sam's Bistoâ€¦ And he signed Tosun! Dyche, Allardyce, Moyes; whoever - we should at least go down swinging.\n679 Posted 14/01/2023 at 00:03:46\n3 wins since the start of the season and a few on here hope we win 8 of the remaining games and beat the drop! Wishful thinking. We have lost to all the teams who were rock bottom or immediately 1 or 2 places above us! You tell me, where all those wins are going to come from!\nAnyone who thinks that Fat Frank can dug us up from this hole is deluded!\nHis sacking is overdue by 2 months. Should have gone after Bournemouth shenanigans.\nOur remaining games are:\nWest Ham A\nArsenal H\nL'Pool A\nLeeds H\nVilla H\nNott F A\nBrentford H\nChelsea A\nTottenham H\nMan U A\nFulham H\nCrystal P A\nNewCastle H\nLeicester A\nBrighton A\nMan C H\nWolves A\nB'mouth H\nWhere do you think those 8 wins will come from with Lampard in charge?\n680 Posted 15/01/2023 at 00:23:28\nThe furor from the fans must continue until the club is sold.\n681 Posted 15/01/2023 at 01:33:48\nI have been critical of Lampard's formation and tactics in the last three months. Today I thought he fielded the best starting eleven available and employed tactics to suit what he had available. It worked for most of the first half but the fragility which is now part of our DNA resurfaced as soon as Southampton applied any pressure.\nGiven that we have no money there seems little point in sacking Lampard. No replacement would be good enough for a divided fan base. I expect he will be allowed to continue in the job for the rest of the season and then given the opportunity to rebuild in the Championship. Whether or not he wants to do that remains to be seen.\n682 Posted 15/01/2023 at 01:41:38\nMoshiri sitting on his hands and hoping Lampard can turn it around without new players is a sure route to relegation and I think that's something that we are all agreed upon.\n683 Posted 15/01/2023 at 01:46:59\n684 Posted 15/01/2023 at 01:53:13\nI keep hearing of getting a caretaker manager or short term fix, that is only papering over the cracks, massive as they are, and repeating history, we need someone to not only get us safe, first and foremost, but to lay the foundation, to build for next season too. We have had too many short term fixes and managers with poor track records (Carlo and Rafa excepted).\nWe have to go for someone who can re-shape our existing players as we can't rely on any magic from the, quickly running out, Transfer Market. Thing is now, who would want to come ? Secondly who would appoint the best for the future of the Club, the Board can't be trusted ?\nPersonally would be happy with Tuchel, Pochettino or Bielsa, again if offered would they take the job of safety first, rebuild, and with little money available ? Certainly worrying times.\nDarren, no mention of Tom Davies, which I hope you have noted, but I still think he's crap !\n685 Posted 15/01/2023 at 02:12:06\nSky cant stop showing Everton games as they have already been paid by various networks around the world to show all premier games, including a new 3year contract that serves the USA and Canada from a previous provider DAZN\n686 Posted 15/01/2023 at 02:34:28\nI don't think Lampard will.I also supported him like you . The whole lot look as if they need put out of their misery.\nThe Championship is not a option given the current state of Everton's finances and the sanctions that the Football League profitability and Sustainability rules will impose on them.On top of that is a whole off the field dysfunctional Management and structure that would have difficulty competing in the Championship.\nThey have four months to turn the whole thing around as outlined by NSNOW.The writing has been on the wall for years. There have been intially lone voices of concern going back 27 years,who have been joined by a steady increase of fellow travellers year on year.Nearly every post now echos these same concerns. Even Protest Posters at Goodison echo the phases these posters have used.\nI have no great confidence they will turn things around with the Board and Owner trying to deflect blame onto the Fans.\nThe Lame Blame, comes to mind.\nOnce Johnson bought the Club for ٦ million it started the self serving era, that has got Everton to the brink, we now all face.\n687 Posted 15/01/2023 at 04:07:02\nSeriously though, my son messaged me during the game to say this was Wolves all over again and it was plain to everyone what was coming. We played okay for an hour, but once Soton put on Anthony Armstrong he took control of the game with Ward-Prowse.\nLampard's substitutions did not make a great deal of sense to me. His faith in the Gordon/Gray and Coady/Tarkowski combos is seriously misplaced, as all four of them were diabolical. None of those 4 players should start the WHU game if he is still in charge.\nWe are now in a strange situation where Lampard will go, but the fans are not broadly calling for his head despite 20 defeats in 37 games. The board will definitely not go, despite the fans fighting to get rid of them. Fans are giving Frank a massive pass becuase they are desperate for him, or any manager, to turn things around. But, they know that with this board in place and a squad that is so poorly built, any manager will need to be a miracle worker.\nLet's remember, as Andy Crooks says, we have half the season to go. I was reading from one poster that we need Top 4 form to survive this season. Not sure of that logic when 7 clubs are separated by 2 points. Form will swing for all of them in the coming months, as none of them are good sides.\nThe big problem is we need to get several massive decisions right in the coming 2 weeks and it is Moshiri and the failed board making them. Let's all strap in for the ride.\n688 Posted 15/01/2023 at 04:12:05\nI finally saw why we paid £30 million for him.\n689 Posted 15/01/2023 at 05:27:56\nI have often wondered why Kevin Thelwell attends home games?\nAs DoF it is his job to coordinate his scouting team(s).\nBut why is he present at Goodison, when he could be elsewhere checking on possible/potential targets.\nHe knows who needs offloading from the squad, and I am not suggesting he doesn't work hard, but he won't learn anything he doesn't already know by attending home games.\nWhether Frank stays or goes, after 2 weeks of the window what's happening?\nThis may not seem relevant in respect of our current situation with the board, but one decent signing could help turn things around in respect of team performances.\n690 Posted 15/01/2023 at 06:05:49\nIn fact the two clubs are so far apart that Liverpool just lost by 3 to Brighton away and Klopp has called it their worst match in his tenure. We lost by 3 to Brighton at home and it was pretty much what everyone expected.\n691 Posted 15/01/2023 at 07:08:41\nI see we made the BBC top 3 headlines this morning. The national media is onto it.\nAnyway, onto West Ham.\n692 Posted 15/01/2023 at 08:04:01\nI am both struggling to cope with our poor situation and wondering how we are possibly going to get out of it. Home games are expected to be at least a win, or at he very least a draw against superior opposition. It doesn't seem to matter who we play at the moment, and even if we score first, that feeling is quickly extinguished, by mistake after mistake, usually ending in defeat.\nWith the Transfer Window running down again it doesn't look like we have anyone positively earmarked, and if we do, we are leaving it late again. Of course there is the strong possibility too, that no-one would want to come either in our present position.\nColin, I am hoping again that people will see through the bias that Kenwright is feeding to the Media and further expose him as the liar he is.\n693 Posted 15/01/2023 at 08:13:09\nI've worded posts carefully in recent weeks (balance of probability, in all likelihood, etc.) but it's time we all faced up to reality. We were relegated yesterday.\n694 Posted 15/01/2023 at 08:23:52\nThere are 19 games to play and 2 points between the bottom 7 clubs - all of whom are poor teams. Show some fight for god's sake.\n695 Posted 15/01/2023 at 08:25:33\nyears of squandering, leading to a situation where we cannot afford to buy players or sack the current manager to resolve the current demise. What a shyte and depressing position to be in!!!\n696 Posted 15/01/2023 at 08:32:02\nWe all know that the problem starts at the top but Lampard, along with Thelwell, identify and buy the players. Lampard, along with his coaches, trains and chooses the team and tactics. He is not good enough, simple as that.\n697 Posted 15/01/2023 at 08:32:23\nIf you are going to direct a point to me. make it something worthwhile.\nWe lost a really crucial match yesterday. Thirteen players failed to beat a bottom of the table side. You havent mentioned any of them.\nI'm really not interested in you coming on to tell me you think the fella who DIDNT play is crap Especially when you do it to demonstrate you wont be mentioning him.\n698 Posted 15/01/2023 at 08:32:35\nThe game was too open for my liking, gaping holes all over the park. If we had 2 marauding full backs I would understand playing 5 at the back but in our case we don't. 5 at the back only suits Coady and Godfrey.\nAdams had a field day against our CBS He held the ball up well and had a hand in both of their goals. Ward Prowse playing in an attacking centre mid role had time and space all match.\nA simple tactic of man marking him wins us the game.\nI thought Onana played well but still needs another midfielder around him. Gueye had a right mixed bag of a game. He is playing like an u11, charging all over the place leaving space in behind all the time. Ward Prowse just ran past him for the first.\nOur subs bench isn't exactly inspiring. Coleman was having a shocker, Gordon's form has dropped off a cliff. Maybe he should have played gray right mid and put Simms on instead of Gordon.\nWe are at the point where it doesn't matter which players are playing as the momentum is going in the wrong direction.\nWe need to make ourselves hard to beat. Go to west ham next week and pack every inch of the defence and midfield. We need to start picking up draws.\n699 Posted 15/01/2023 at 08:32:35\n700 Posted 15/01/2023 at 08:39:31\nThe winnable games have simply run out. There is no path to 7 wins from the 19 remaining. Yesterday really was our last chance.\n701 Posted 15/01/2023 at 08:57:01\nI stayed behind after the match. It's difficult to gauge how many did so, I would guess perhaps 10% of a full crowd, so around 4,000.\nThe players took quite a long time to leave the pitch and were met with a chorus of “You're not fit to wear the shirtâ€. Some went to acknowledge the crowd from a distance but were not well-received.\nOnana, the last to go down the tunnel, was the last to disappear and was applauded by some fans in the Main Stand where I was.\nQuite a few banners were unfurled. There were chants of “Sack the Boardâ€ and “Evertonâ€. Things looked a bit heated with a group of fans and stewards behind the Gwladys Street goal, no trouble but animated discussion.\nI didn't experience anger so much as dejection and resignation amongst those standing where I was. For me, it was sadness. Goodison Park is a special place for us, at times for my family (and, I'm sure, others) it has been the place to be following bereavements. It has soul. But at 5:15 pm yesterday, it felt badly broken.\n702 Posted 15/01/2023 at 09:01:00\nThe reason why we're not mid-table is that we're poorly coached and organised. The midfield and back four are porous. Similar basic mistakes are happening game after game.\nYes, we're poor up front, because we keep buying players who don't score goals. The players are now at that sad, familiar stage where they know what they're doing isn't working.\n703 Posted 15/01/2023 at 09:03:39\nAbout the game yesterday, there weren't many players worthy of praise, Pickford and Onana, who probably had his best for us yet, were the only two that stood out for me.\nThis is one of the main problems, each week you can count on one hand how many actually played well, or sometimes just two fingers, I'm sorry but this has to be down to the Coaching. I thought when we got Ashley Cole as part of the Coaching set-up, defensively things would improve, if anything they have got worse.\nI'm afraid if we stick with Frank, we are only going in one direction, and it's not the one we all want.\n704 Posted 15/01/2023 at 09:16:20\nGodfrey stared down Tarkowski after the equaliser as he knew he should have done better and, for the winner, Pickford is looking at Mykolenko?\nAll players only have themselves to blame. Yes, I think Lampard should have made changes earlier but the players couldn't make a pass, constantly gave the ball away, and Southampton didn't have to beat us, we beat ourselves.\nMy cup is always half-full and as a season ticket holder I will look forward to rightly or not being supporting the team expected to win games as I cannot see a way out of the trouble we are in.\nI have resigned myself to the fact that it's Championship football for us next season which obviously means no more embarrassing losses to them over the road but I will not be gracing Goodison Park with my presence again this season.\n705 Posted 15/01/2023 at 09:18:18\nIf we drew every game from now until the end of the season, we will STILL get relegated. We are past the point of â€˜keep stable to survive'. We need 6-7 wins, and some draws too. Nothing less will keep us up.\nSo, first part of the plan is two proper strikers up top. Whether that's 3-5-2 or 4-4-2 is debatableâ€¦ but put them there and give it a go. Only Calvert-Lewin, Simms and Maupay qualify as strikers, so there's the choice.\nSome other things I want to see:\nâ— If we can sell Pickford this window and bring in a young promising keeper like the Southampton lad yesterday, then do it.\nâ— Put Gordon out to anyone who'd offer more than 㾶M to 㾻M. He's another Rodwell. We can't afford long contracts right now, so if no biters, and the sulk continues, then put him in the Under-21s for the rest of the season and bring Mills in to replace him. We need to show ruthlessness.\nâ— If anyone is showing interest in DoucourÃ© or Keane, then sell them too. Even if considered a rival for relegation. If we survive, then it'll now be what we do â€“ not what others don't. If they ain't good enough for this team (and we cannot keep big wages around next season) then let them go.\nâ— Break up the Coady and Tarkowski fallacy and mythâ€¦ personally, I'd bring back Branthwaite and promote Welch too, and bench both Coady and Tarkowski behind Mina. However, I can't see any manager with the balls to do thatâ€¦ so bench one and play Mina alongside the remainder.\nâ— Sack Thelwell immediately and give Cahill the role on an interim basis with a view that the role will retire with a new manager given full remit on players and coaching.\nâ— Sack Denise Barrrett-Baxendale from CEO too, and put her back in the community role. (We all want Bill gone, but that's not going to happen yet.)\nâ— If we are adrift after the next 5 games, bin the lot and start playing Leban, Price, Mills, Simms, Welch, Samuels-Smith, et al ready for next season's Championship run.\nâ— Above all else, sack Fat Frank and his coaching team today. All of them. If we had to ask Paul Tait to do it with Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman for a few games, then even that is better than sticking with this grey dull fool for any longer.\n706 Posted 15/01/2023 at 09:40:53\nAnother nineteen rounds of this could cause a lot of people serious brain damage.\n707 Posted 15/01/2023 at 09:45:36\nWhoever plays, whoever manages, this is Everton you bastards, get up off the floor and fight. We are not giving in and neither are you.\n708 Posted 15/01/2023 at 09:52:17\nPut onana behind Calvert lewin like we used to push fellaini up, and have doucure and gueye sitting back.\nGray then completes the line up.\nGo more direct and hope we start scoring more.\nWe really need a set piece taker in this window as well as a goal scorer\n709 Posted 15/01/2023 at 10:02:30\nIt's been obvious for 18 months we need a striker. We are halfway through this latest transfer window and nothing. We were told plans were formed to bring players in and nothing. If we don't bring somebody in who can score we are down.\nYesterday's game displayed the lack of thinking among players and manager. The free kick given to Ward-Prowse by Gordon's stupidity, shows a lack of thinking and ability. The manager cannot make changes, he doesn't have the ability or courage to change things at any time.\nThe club faces massive problems. You cannot sack all the board and manager at the same time, although all need to change. I realise no manager, maybe Ancelotti, who could deal with these players. Frank certainly is no manager. The board need to change over the next year to a more professional outfit.\nOn the player front, I cannot understand the clamour to get rid of Pickford, there are not many out there who are better. Maupay will not succeed as a frontman with the way this team plays. Gordon thinks he is better than he is and should be allowed to go. DoucourÃ© needs to play in the role he had at Watford, indeed this is a general problem, not playing players in the position they are best. Davies will not make it.\nI will leave it that for the moment.\n710 Posted 15/01/2023 at 10:02:48\n711 Posted 15/01/2023 at 10:23:29\n712 Posted 15/01/2023 at 10:26:05\nThe league Everton are playing their football in is irrelevant if Kenwright is still Chairman-he is poison.\nI don't give a shit about keeping up with the Jonesys, ie being a shit team in the PL and a shiny new stadium- I just want a well run club, with a long term plan and the team based on youth.\nNone of that will ever happen with Kenwright in charge-never.\nSorry,but it's time to start afresh at Everton. I will turn up and support Everton regardless of which league they are in forever, but I refuse to go until Kenwright is gone. It just strengthens his position for me. I wish all Evertonians well, so I am not being antagonistic in any way.\n713 Posted 15/01/2023 at 10:29:59\nI can only think people who praise Coady and Tarkowski have never actually played. They are a nightmare for the rest of the team. Even defending as deep as they do they are still conceding left right and center.\nAfter being bullied by a teenager last time out they were all over she shop again yesterday.\nIf I was a manager of the Dog N Duck I'd be furious at my center backs if they didnt cut out that long floaty ball to Adams for the Southampton first goal. How did they let him win that ???. Cut that out and we win the game.\nThese two have been mullered by South coast teams recently. Bournemouth. The kid at Brighton and now Che Adams.\nThey're so bad. The seaside likes to be besides us.\nChristine 707.\nGet paid girl. I hate all this white flag waving. EVERY game is winnable.\nFooty is decided on skill, will, luck, fight. players suddenly finding form, decisions suddenly going for you... A new player. The wind can change in a heartbeat.\nNobody ever won a trophy or got relegated in January through the balance of probabilities.\n714 Posted 15/01/2023 at 10:31:55\n715 Posted 15/01/2023 at 10:35:51\n716 Posted 15/01/2023 at 10:39:46\n717 Posted 15/01/2023 at 10:41:07\nYou have taken me literally. A point away from home packing midfield and defence should be a starting point to get away from this run of defeats.\nWolves and Southampton came to us looking for a draw. Both got a win due to us over committing players. We need to stop this rot.\nThere are 2 points separating 7 teams. We need to keep in touch with that group.\nWe have to play tight ugly football otherwise we are down.\nI totally agree Lampard needs to go. His medalling has caused half of the problems. His 2 wingers have been a disaster. Gordon comes on yesterday, we go 433 and what a surprise we over commit players, Gordon makes the fouls. End of game.\n718 Posted 15/01/2023 at 10:41:07\n719 Posted 15/01/2023 at 10:46:32\nOnana breaking through yesterday, saints take one for the team. Doucoure the other week and Iwobi yesterday could have brought the man down and took the booking in a non dangerous location on the pitch.\nThey are not just poor technically, physically, they are unable to see the game.\n720 Posted 15/01/2023 at 10:47:04\nI'm not sure Dyche is the answer. He was taking Burnley down and they sacked him and they got some managerial bounce under Jackson but couldn't maintain it.\nWe have bought relegated players or players teams don't want like Coady, Tarkowski, McNeill, Maupay, Gueye, Gray, there is only one place that leads and we shouldn't be surprised.\n721 Posted 15/01/2023 at 10:49:33\n722 Posted 15/01/2023 at 10:52:27\nCannot for the life of me see HOW! we can survive this. Sorry but we're royaly fucked.\n723 Posted 15/01/2023 at 10:54:55\nAfter last season and seasons past we will look back how fortunate we have been to stay a premiership club for so long. The crash and burn policy of selling our best players has come home to bite us. All of us of the Everton family are going through phases of a grieving process. The anger of it all, bargaining for a new manager or acceptance of it all. It's been a struggle to support this club over the past 30 years, emotionally draining!\nIt will be sad to go down but hand on heart we knew it was coming. Our glory years have been a torment to our younger fans to what may of been. Perhaps going one step back may lead to better days ahead. Personally, it's a long road ahead and financially keeping the new ground should be our main aim. Keeping our home must happen whatever league we are in? We as fans must come together and support each other. No arguing and behave with dignity!! An emotional few months ahead for all!\n724 Posted 15/01/2023 at 10:55:32\nA voice of common sense as usual.\n725 Posted 15/01/2023 at 10:56:02\nBy all means try and shut up shop away to City, United, Arsenal (albeit you can't stop them scoring). Anyone else, we should be trying to win. Home or sway.\n726 Posted 15/01/2023 at 10:58:53\nThe team needs organising and coaching. How many times are there huge gaps in midfield and defence? During the Utd defeat, I noticed a touchline conversation between Lampard and Tarkowski, who appeared to be visibly disagreeing. Healthy debate or a sign of player discord?\nPlenty of points to play for. There will be surprise results, fluctuating form, unlikely heroes. We know things can change very, very quickly. But will that be enough for us?\nYou have to make your own luck in this world. Instead of droning on about media bias, bad luck, curses, hard work, how about organising the team so it's tight throughout the pitch? How about having two strikers on the pitch so we play more in the opposition half? How about players thinking for an extra nano-second before running out of position, or into opponents outside our box?\nI don't see us bringing anyone in until the last few wheeler-dealer days of the window. So, that either gives Frank an extra couple of weeks, or gives the new man time to find his player targets.\nIt's in our hands. Moshiri should either replace Frank tomorrow or tell us he's staying here to finish the job in either division.\nWhoever the manager is, we need to be better organised. Otherwise we'll need two or three goals to win a game. And that's hardly our strong suit, is it?\nIt's in our hands and we have plenty of time. But things need to change, quickly.\n727 Posted 15/01/2023 at 11:09:56\nEverton let Soton, as they have with several teams this season off the hook.\nDid Soton, fight for their shirt for the full game, yes they did.\nDid all Everton players, show the same spirit. No.\nLack of professionalism, game management, guts, pride in the shirt and bottle, standard remit of footballer tool box, basics, which this squad have consistently forgotten, this and for much of last season.\nBut there's half a season to play for but drastic jeopardy management skills, and some fekkn luck, are needed now to give all in every game, and the old cliche, pull off a very difficult mission and secure 33 points, to be safe and stay in this League.\nThere's a fine line between the bottom 7 teams and any team that can put a run of 2 or 3 games back to back, will edge up the table.\nBut the reality is, what it is, but there's no time to feel sorry and Frank, as I expect he will be in charge for West Ham, must get his team to beat West Ham.\nI'm expecting last minute deals to be done to bring a couple of strikers.forwards in, but who knows, what the real financial state of affairs really is, but any new players arriving sooner than later, and ready to go would be better.\nStaying in this League for the last season of the Old Ladys time, must happen, it's. Or a given, and only hard work, and belief can achieve it.\nThe Evertonians, care, let the squad show they really do care, and fight and play like they care, for every match single minute of every remaining fixture.\nUTFT!\n728 Posted 15/01/2023 at 11:11:31\nThe Fans are largely blameless in all of this, yet they are culpable for all the Club's ills according to 'Mosh the Dosh', soon to be 'Clint the Skint' if he carries on with his head in the sand. We all want the best for Everton, I 'm sure of that, but unless something changes and soon, at all levels, there is only one outcome that I can see.\n729 Posted 15/01/2023 at 11:12:07\n730 Posted 15/01/2023 at 11:13:27\nIts now desperation! Common sense went out of the window when Bk was allowed to keep his train set and employ his sycophants.\nI support any manager...even Benitez when he was here, but Frank has tried my patience to the nth degree.\nThe board are hunkering down and are that desperate they are pointing fingers at the fans.\nThere is no cohesion at board, fan, management and playing level.\nYou cannot run a club with those dynamics.\n731 Posted 15/01/2023 at 11:22:43\nCan we now put in place a sensible manager who plays the tried and trusted 442 or 451\nBack 4 and a strong midfield and we will start picking up points but we must act immediately\n732 Posted 15/01/2023 at 11:23:49\nChampionship sides are coming up much better equipt and in better shape than we are lately. Fulham, Leeds, Villa to name just a few and it will be the same next year.\nWe have and still are trying to get rid of players on big contracts and who are deemed not part of the squad, whilst trying to bring new players in in our current situation (financial and league position) and it's proving too much of a job.(MGW, Kudus and Broja would have been the answers but we wasted all summer trying to get them in leaving us ill prepared with any plan B going into the season).\nThere is still so many players who need to go or have had their chance (Keane, Holgate, Davies, Doucoure, Mina) and then who are we left with:-\nGray (inconsistant)\nIwobi (Poor shooting/Crossing)\nGordon (Flash in the pan)\nDCL (Inconsistant)\nGodfrey (Not PL quality)\nOnana (Potential)\nMykolenko (Potential/lack of creativity)\nPatterson (Potential)\nGana/Coleman (On Decline)\nPickford/Tarky/Coady (PL qualty)\nMcNeal (Potential)\nMuapay (Not PL Quality?)\nSo who are we relying on to get us out of this out of that group? truth is it's out of it's depth in this league.\nThe under 23 squad seems brimmed with talent and with some new additons next year hopefully we can build an identity again how sad that is; hopefully with a new board as well.\nI'm not accepting defeat it's just plain obvious what is coming.\n733 Posted 15/01/2023 at 11:24:50\n734 Posted 15/01/2023 at 11:31:42\nIn our last 4 home games we've played Leicester, Wolves and Southampton all of who were below us at the time and all of who have walked off with the 3 points.\nLast season and this one so far we've won 3 out of 29 league games away from home.\nHow are this group of players suddenly going to turn that around? Where is a spark coming from?\n735 Posted 15/01/2023 at 11:35:33\nGary, it's not naive. We're a win away from overtaking many of those around us. There will be a few twists yet.\nI've been calling for change for quite a while now. Maybe mine has been directed at the manager. Maybe for the here and now, that needs to happen as Andy says,\nBut the reality is, for the longer term ambition of this club, change is needed elsewhere other than the dugout.\nI find it really sad that one of my childhood heroes couldn't go to Goodison yesterday. Third in line only behind Kevin Sheedy and Peter Reid.\nStill angry with the club for that ridiculous press release only hours before kick off. Not only did it pour petrol on the fire, I can't think what must have been going through the players' and Manager's head in the changing room.\nAnd that's not making excuses.\nTo the match, is it me and I don't normally jump on Goalkeepers' back for the sake of it. But anyone else think Pickford was unusually static for that free kick? His \"cat on hot tin\" and reactive shot stopping is normally his speciality.\nOr was it just that good of a free kick?\n736 Posted 15/01/2023 at 11:36:50\nIndeed, despite this being the most natural need in the summer, we went and bought another 2 right footers, to go with the 4 of them we already had, and let the ONLY natural left footer leave on loan, all because he got done by Ivan Toney 50% less times than Tarkowski got done by Adam's yesterday alone.\nThe way the club is run is mind boggling. I think it's done on who frank likes to have a brew with.\n737 Posted 15/01/2023 at 11:39:19\nI've been disappointed with him and Tarkowski to be honest. Sounds bites and shouting is worth nothing when players are skating through the middle.\nCan we also stop passing it back to Pickford to clear. Surely it's better for Coady or Tarkowski to play the long ball than an under pressure Pickford 20 yards behind. Absolutely shit tactics from a manager who is lost.\n738 Posted 15/01/2023 at 11:39:22\nWe all know we need stability, but when I look out on the pitch, I don't see that much idea, and if a manager can't get his points across and get the best out of his squad, then he's obviously not doing a good enough job.\nI like Lampard, the man, but the writing is on the wall. His tactics are awful, his players lack belief, and he's picking players for the sake of it imo, however hard, I'm aware his job is.\n739 Posted 15/01/2023 at 11:40:05\n740 Posted 15/01/2023 at 11:40:31\n741 Posted 15/01/2023 at 11:40:40\n742 Posted 15/01/2023 at 11:48:07\n743 Posted 15/01/2023 at 11:51:36\nIt's a sad reality that every player in our squad wouldn't get into a top half Prem side (apart from Pickford).\nThe rest of them are Championship level/bottom three: Coady, Tarkowski, Coleman, Gray, Gueye, Godfrey, Mykolenko, Iwobi, Begovic, Davies, Doucoure, Gordon, Holgate, Maupay, Townsend, McNeill, Garner, Keane, Patterson.\nDCL and Onana could do a job for a mid table team.\nI don't see this team/squad beating 8 higher teams. I think our only hope is to scrap and fight and try and nick what we can and hope it's enough to finish higher than three other clubs.\n744 Posted 15/01/2023 at 11:56:38\nI have had major concerns over Coady and Tarkowski for quite a while, many pointed to our good goals against record earlier in the season as being largely down to them. But Kane had more touches in and around our box than he had in previous games and when we played Fulham, Mitrovic had 10 attempts at goal.\nBoth Tarkowski and Coady are slow and neither are that dominant in the air, yet Lampard has built his team on their defensive qualities, and he also talks a lot about their leadership. Mina is our best CB and I know he gets injured far to often but when fit he should be the first name on the team sheet, but that wont happen while Lampard is in charge.\nLets not forget Lampard has brought in 8 players so when those who support him say nobody can get a tune out of this team don't forget he recruited most of them.\nI cant quite believe that despite having the worst record of any Everton manager that he was not replaced prior to the World Cup, which both Wolves and Villa did and both seem to be edging towards safety. I have no idea why Moshiri hasn't pulled the plug, is it we cant afford to pay him and his coaches off, or is it that fact that Moshiri has been criticized for sacking managers to quickly that he is reluctant to sack another manager.\nYes we still have enough points to play for to be able to escape relegation but ONLY if they change the manager now. Looking at Lampard being interviewed after the game I think he will genuinely be relieved when he evetually gets the call from Moshiri, nice guy but like many great players hasnt got what it takes to be a manager.\n745 Posted 15/01/2023 at 12:04:37\n746 Posted 15/01/2023 at 12:11:08\nI like both, and while aware of their flaws, still think the midfield is more to blame. The centre-backs are put under constant pressure even against average sides due to our inability to keep the ball. Even Gray kept dithering and losing it yesterday.\nHaving said all of that, I know that I get sucked into the small joy of the last ditch block/tackle that Tarkowski excels at â€“ which of course are not needed so regularly in better defences â€“ and maybe, on reflection, I can see Darren's point.\nMy question is, would their flaws be quite such a problem in a better-coached team?\n747 Posted 15/01/2023 at 12:16:52\nIt's the midfield leaving gaping holes, getting caught on the ball and the attack who can't keep hold of it, they are constantly exposed IMO.\n748 Posted 15/01/2023 at 12:26:41\nI will also add Godfrey as to why Lampard's choice of centre-backs is floored. Southampton's first goal showed their deficiencies. Tarkowski, instead of being behind their striker is a yard ahead of him, Coady comes to cover him and doesn't win the header.\nWhen it's knocked down to Ward-Prowse, instead of staying on his feet and making a tackle, Godfrey goes to ground and misses the ball, giving Ward-Prowse a tap-in. That goal changed the whole game you could see the confidence evaporate from the players and the fans.\nShould miraculously Lampard still be in charge for the West Ham game, no doubt he will have Coady and Tarkowski as his centre-back pairing. Just watch how neither will carry the ball a yard or 2 forward; instead, they will pass square to each other or launch a 40-yard diagonal ball. They never ever carry the ball out of defence when at times they have the space and time to do it.\nBy the way, they are not the only problem this side has problems all over the park, but I think their negative approach is why we struggle to get enough players forward in attack. Because the centre-backs sit so deep, if the midfield moved forward to help the attack there would be even bigger gaps than there are now.\n749 Posted 15/01/2023 at 12:36:00\n750 Posted 15/01/2023 at 12:39:10\nCoady is deeper than the ocean, Coleman and Mykolenko looked totally lost in that formation, for different reasons, but it was Onana, (being contentious) who was the biggest disappointment yesterday, because no way a player with his talent, should have been walking off the pitch, with his team losing.\nGet a tight defense and build around Onana, by forcing him to constantly stay in the game?\n751 Posted 15/01/2023 at 12:39:49\n“Only player to have scored hat-tricks in all four professional divisions in England, the FA Cup, League Cup and in an international fixtureâ€\n752 Posted 15/01/2023 at 12:41:43\nTarkowski is not a left-sided centre-back and Godfrey (superb at last-ditch tackles) is not a very good footballer. Coady looks too slow.\nOf course the midfield don't help the defence much and Gray, McNeil and Gordon provide little or no cover for the full-backs.\nIt's ultimately the lack of goals that's killing us but all parts of the team, including the defence, are broken. I know this will invite ridicule but, even allowing for occasional brain farts, I'd bring back Keane. I think we might just grind out some 1-0's with him playing. Cue brickbats â€¦.\n753 Posted 15/01/2023 at 12:43:48\nGiven how deep we defend it is vital that the midfield protects the defence and stops opposing forwards getting to our penalty area.\nThis doesn't happen because Gueye is possibly the worst CDM I've ever seen at the club. He charges all over the pitch losing position and possession.\n754 Posted 15/01/2023 at 12:46:39\nPeople are getting paid thousands a week to coach, so how anyone could have been happy with the way that Pickford lined up his wall, for both the goal, and another free kick a few minutes earlier is beyond me.\nIf you can't see the ball, then you haven't done your job. if your first real sight of the ball is when it's already dipping over the wall, then sorry but you have put yourself in trouble because you haven't done your job properly.\nGreat goal For a Southampton fan but, for a goalkeeper of Pickford's level, it was an absolute shocker, imo.\n755 Posted 15/01/2023 at 12:48:49\nShould have been playing.\n756 Posted 15/01/2023 at 12:50:03\nHe cannot blame the fans for Frank. Whilst most of us railed against appointing Pereira, it was a new board decision that appointed Frank. Remember them in London in the people carrier at Kenwright's offices.\nThey need to bring the club together and say \"We, the board, got it wrong.\"\nThen Moshiri needs to say \"I will sell\" and Kenwright needs to say \"And at that point, I will leave, I admit I have let you all down and the good times have been non-existent.\"\nThen Moshiri needs to appoint Tuchel or Pochettino so we get a bounce and then, and only then, will we survive. The club is toxic.\nIf they sit on their hands and keep Frank, we're fucked, simple as that. Frank's insistence not to play Simms and wait for Calvert-Lewin to turn into Haaland is mental. Calvert-Lewin is never going to be that player.\nMoshiriI, Kenwright — Do what you need to do!\nNSNO\n757 Posted 15/01/2023 at 12:57:34\n758 Posted 15/01/2023 at 12:57:35\ngame for safety reasons is immeasurable. The huge negative reaction is all over the\nmedia. Further, as a result of the Board's non attendance the ire of the crowd after\nthe game could only be focused on the players. To hear the chant of â€˜Your'e not fit\nto wear the shirt' made my blood run cold. To witness the breaking of the bond between\nsupporters and players was horrible.\nWhat needs to happen urgently is for the Club to disclose the full facts of the alleged incident. If someone has put a headlock on the CEO, as has been rumoured, then the identity\nof the culprit will be known. The Club can then confirm that appropriate Police action has been taken and the person banned for life. Apparently this â€˜assault' took place after the\nBrighton game so why was nothing said for 10 days afterwards?\nIt all smells rotten to me and the full facts need to come out.\n759 Posted 15/01/2023 at 12:58:50\n760 Posted 15/01/2023 at 13:11:17\nDennis @756\nI agree with that , Mina should be starting if he is fit . He is our best quality central defender.\nThese stats are not current but nevertheless they do tell a story about how a quality centre back can influence games.\n“Sky Sports reported that over the last two Premier League seasons, our win percentage with Yerry Mina in the team was 57%. Without him however, this was an extremely concerning 24%. It doesn't take a mathematician to work out that's a significant difference. Moreover, we average 1.7 goals conceded without him, compared to 1.1 with and 0.9 points per game compared to 1.9. “\nIt's a crying shame that Yerry can get a niggle going to the corner shop for the Colombian Daily Tribune.\n761 Posted 15/01/2023 at 13:16:22\nI completely agree regarding Pickford, and if he must insist on leaving 3/4 of the goal to aim at, he should have had a full-back on the post.\nMind you, if Gordon hadn't've bundled Adams over needlessly, then it wouldn't have happened, Pickford did make a cracking save off Ward-Prowse earlier on, but I think he has to take his share of the blame for the 2nd goal along with Gordon and Gray who lost possession needlessly.\nI thought Onana really tried to drive the team on yesterday, his best performance in a blue shirt so far; long may it continue.\nAs for Gana, I've been really disappointed in him since he came back, I thought his experience playing for PSG in the Champions League would mean he's improved his passing ability but it's as bad as ever, very careless and sloppy.\nKeep the faith, Blues. ðŸ’™ Kenwright OUT!!!\n762 Posted 15/01/2023 at 13:25:55\nGreat free kick. That boy can deliver. His corners are frightening. Imagine if he had someone like Haaland or Kane queueing up.\n763 Posted 15/01/2023 at 13:44:27\nTony 738\nI take my hat off to both of you.\nIn the midst of all this unrest, you have a never give up attitude.\nTo those who say we are already down! Nobody has been relegated half way through the season!\nThe league isn't won in March.\nIf yesterdays after match protest hasn't made an impression on BK and his gang, nothing will.\nWhether Frank stays or not, we as true Evertonians have to get behind the team.\nA proven striker would be very welcome, but unlikely.\nSo despite all the despondency (and I'm hurting big time) Christine and Tony's comments are what is needed to get us out of this mess.\nIt's 3 from 7, so it's going to be tight but doable.\n764 Posted 15/01/2023 at 13:54:49\n765 Posted 15/01/2023 at 14:03:30\nNo true Evertonian gives up.\nWhether Frank stays or not, ???????\nThats not an option. Get him out ASAP.\n766 Posted 15/01/2023 at 14:08:30\nThat's where we are.\n767 Posted 15/01/2023 at 14:12:30\n768 Posted 15/01/2023 at 14:14:03\nRegarding the CEO supposed to have been put in a headlock, how did it take 10 days to come to light, especially as the directors knew there was going to be a sit in and a protest by fans. Whether it's true or not, the club has been shamed, and anyone looking to buy the club will have 2nd thought's. The fan confronting Mina with his child in the car was a total moron, our fans were always held in high esteem all over the world.\n769 Posted 15/01/2023 at 14:20:50\nSome of them are none too bright and I wouldn't even call them scallies as most of them work and don't go on the rob, as is my understanding of scally.\nYou should hear the best fans in the world pissed and coked up on a tube in London after a 5:30 kick off on a Saturday.\n770 Posted 15/01/2023 at 14:22:46\nChances created.\nGoals scored.\nEffort.\nTogetherness.\nLeadership.\nThis is by no means the worst squad or performances I have seen in the last 10 years never mind the worst since the 50's.\nHave others forgotten the 90's, the 00's and more recently under Sam and Benitez?\nEven in loss we have created chances and scored goals. We have pace, a good blend of experience and youth and from what I can tell the players are trying and putting the effort in.\nI was convinced we would be relegated last season and somehow we stayed up.\nA good signing this window, a bit of good luck and we can avoid the drop.\nThe board may be useless, but the players, the coaches, the recruitment and fans are what is important. Stick together, stay positive, stop the stupid errors and keep fighting to the end.\n771 Posted 15/01/2023 at 14:27:51\nAs you say, no true Evertonian ever gives up.\nI won't, and I'm sure you won't. Very frustrating but that's how it is currently!\n772 Posted 15/01/2023 at 14:32:37\nOne final observation, is it against the rules to move the ball backwards, for a free kick? To me, that ball looked 2 or 3 yards further back than where the foul was committed.\nMay not seem much, and probably petty, but it did give Ward-Prowse a better chance of getting the ball over the wall and to dip, not that he needed any assistance in that regard, because he was given all the assistance he needed with Pickford's poor positioning.\n773 Posted 15/01/2023 at 14:46:05\nSo who will make the decision to keep Lampard or sack him? Will it be the board who, with the support of fans, drove his appointment twelve months ago? Will it be Thelwell? Does Thelwell have that level of authority?\nThe answer to my first question, I suspect, is that nobody is in charge currently.\n774 Posted 15/01/2023 at 14:46:25\nIn the 70s, I was a season ticket holder and one year I managed not to miss a game home and away, even got a stewards part-time job at Goodison Park where I stepped in for absentees. So Everton were in my blood and part of my life.\nIn 1976. I got the opportunity to go to Canada with my family and, after a couple of months, the season started but I could not get any information about the English Football League. If I had known beforehand, I may not have gone, and I will not comment on how I tried to get information on Everton but \"Life went on\".\nIn the early 90s I lost my youngest boy in a car accident that floored me but \"Life went on\".\nIn 2020, my wife fell and has fractures in her back that will not heal and an operation will put her in a wheelchairâ€¦ it's difficult but \"Life went on\".\nIn 2021, she was diagnosed with Dementia â€“ another body blow but \"Life goes on\".\nI am not looking for sympathy, far from it, it is for those who say they will not go anymore even if there is a possibility that they may be relegated. \"Life goes on\" â€“ and the only one you are punishing is yourself.\nThe team need you more than ever, not the Owner or the Board, but the boys in the blue shirts.\nFunny thing, I always tape the game and watch it later and find it was not as bad as when I was watching it live and emotionally.\nThere are 7/8 teams who are feeling the threat of relegation, we are not the only ones, so don't let your attitude of \"We are definitely going down\" embroil you. Gates go up when you are doing well as everyone loves a winner, true supporters will back the players.\nBy no means am I saying that those who say they will not go anymore unless things change are not true supporters, but I just believe that those who are capable support the team the best they know how.\nAnother rant over.\n775 Posted 15/01/2023 at 15:06:13\nI suspect Kenwright is awaiting developments at West Ham.\n776 Posted 15/01/2023 at 15:08:54\nIt really annoys me when posters say “That's it, I've had enough, not going anymore, \" etc etc etc.\nFine, just go, don't come on here to broadcast the fact, as if looking for someone to try and talk you round.\nOne of the lads I go the aways with, does something similar. I don't “Plead with him to reconsiderâ€, I just say “Fine, I know someone who will have your ticket.â€ He does end up going though!\nI've had too many run-ins on this site with people who “Threaten to Jack it inâ€, and been suspended as a result of it, so I will say no more on the subject.\n777 Posted 15/01/2023 at 15:16:13\nDo you think Moyes will be on our team coach home next Saturday, and Lampard will be lapping it up in the West Ham board room?\n778 Posted 15/01/2023 at 15:23:12\n779 Posted 15/01/2023 at 15:29:07\nAt this point, the prospect of Moyes wheeling and dealing in the last two weeks of the window on Everton's behalf would please me greatly.\n780 Posted 15/01/2023 at 15:35:09\n781 Posted 15/01/2023 at 15:36:01\nRob, see you Saturday.\nWe will never have enough.\n782 Posted 15/01/2023 at 15:44:59\n783 Posted 15/01/2023 at 15:45:35\n784 Posted 15/01/2023 at 15:54:35\nWe got what we deserved from a relegation rival who like us are fairly poor but contrary to what you were saying a few days ago are improving.\nThe fact that the team could not take advantage of a home fixture and beat a relegation rival to increase the gap between them and us to 6 points is fucking criminal.\nAny team coming to Goodison will fancy their chances unless this manager is sacked.\nHow anyone is still behind him, I just don't understand.\n785 Posted 15/01/2023 at 15:56:03\nFrom challenging a stall selling Nazi Memorabilia (Yes) â€“and we all know they \"hiss\" when playing Spurs â€“ to the severe physical attacks I mentioned last year here on TW. I was spat at, beaten and attacked (from behind), called Scouse Scum and why don't I just die and save the taxpayers some Benefits Money.\nYou are a big man, Rob, maybe the cowards only pick on little 73-year-old long-haired ribbon-wearing weirdos like me. I am not violent, I do have a Black Belt in Origami but had to control myself. 4 young thugs attacked me and older men couldn't resist punching me from behind, some had children with them.\nI told them I drank in The Dark House and always welcome any away fans â€“ I hope they get relegated and rot in their pornographer's hell.\n786 Posted 15/01/2023 at 17:04:51\n787 Posted 15/01/2023 at 17:06:00\n788 Posted 15/01/2023 at 17:14:47\n789 Posted 15/01/2023 at 17:18:39\n790 Posted 15/01/2023 at 17:22:37\nThats a cracking post mate and you have asked a couple of pertinent questions.\nI've been quick to point the finger at our center backs this season, I believe they have refused to come out of their comfort zone because they don't have the confidence in themselves to do it, but I wouldnt rule out your theory. Could it be they don't have the confidence in those around them ?\nAre we coached as a unit ?\nI'm a great admirer of George Graham. His tactics are probably a little dated now, but he really understood the footballer. He insisted his players trusted each other. If you didnt trust a team mate, You were out.\nYou cant knit together a football team unless the players trust each other.\nThis is Franks biggest challenge. its very difficult to build trust when everyone is playing shite.... But thats what he has got to do\n791 Posted 15/01/2023 at 17:23:28\nWest Ham have confirmed he's definitely going to be the manager against us, and if he loses that he's gone but we won't be sacking Frank, and if we lose and sack Frank, Moyes has bought himself another few weeks. Sod's law.\n792 Posted 15/01/2023 at 17:28:51\n793 Posted 15/01/2023 at 17:29:01\n794 Posted 15/01/2023 at 17:34:07\n795 Posted 15/01/2023 at 17:36:02\nThe Club Moyes built here is a shining edifice on a hill compared with this shitscape. He's done a superb job at Hammers, it's just he was pushed beyond his comfort zone in the summer, when the club insisted he spend big to smash into the Top 4.\nThat's not where his talent lies, it's in getting mediocre clubs to the European spots. He's exactly what we need right now, in my view.\n796 Posted 15/01/2023 at 17:43:58\nThe board needs to change\nSome players just aren't good enough but chanting you're not fit to wear the shirt at the players is self defeating. How will that ever motivate any player to give more or entice any player to join us?\nWhilst I saw many limitation in ability I saw no lack of effort from my seat.\nOnana will be a player\n797 Posted 15/01/2023 at 17:45:39\nWith all due respect, I appreciate Moyes was a safe pair of hands when he was here but I believe, whether player or manager, it rarely ever works going back for a second stint.\n798 Posted 15/01/2023 at 17:48:07\nWe must make a change whilst sufficient games remain. We play West Ham which looks like it will be with Frank. Lose that and it's Arsenal and Liverpool next, not an easy start for the new incumbent if, as expected, we have lost to the Hammers and Lampard goes.\nThe board will dither and make another poor appointment. I don't see a way out.\n799 Posted 15/01/2023 at 18:00:18\n800 Posted 15/01/2023 at 18:01:07\n801 Posted 15/01/2023 at 18:03:39\nA back to basics approach dropping the pretence of being a challenging club and it was a relatively easy fix and Moyes did it admirably with very few additions the following season.\nNo such core exists in this set up, far from it, these players look, smel and play like relegation jonnys. If Moyes thought his stint at Sunderland was mission impossible he'll cack his pants if he returns here.\n802 Posted 15/01/2023 at 18:55:20\nI was behind Frank but now the only option must be to each him?\nAny decent manager could be getting a better tune out of a team with a spine of Pickford, Coady, Tarkowski, Onana, DCL\nWe have absolutely no pattern of play!\nWe are awful but have half a season left and there are 7 very average teams ( I accept we're currently the worse team)\nOn a wider note, Neville Southall is spot on this was inevitable when you start thinking 10th is good! A matter of time. 20/25 years ago Man Utd, Arsenal and RS were our contemporaries. Why haven't we benefited from being an ever present in PL ?\nWho sacks a board ?? They can't sack themselves! Surely selling is the only option ? Does Moshiri care ?\nHaving a go at the players is totally counter productive at this point. I fear a downing of tools! A fear of playing, inability to attract anyone!\nThe pessimist in me is already thinking relegation to league 1, no stadium and liquidation. Not impossible I fear ?!\nWas in Liverpool for weekend for the game. Our commercial department is still atrocious. Completely limited presence in the city!\nDepressing, although it can be changed and we can improve it feels different this time ! Almost like we've accepted it ? Very worrying!\n804 Posted 15/01/2023 at 19:20:29\nI believe it's an easy fix. I wouldn't even rate these present coaches as second rate. No, they are not that good. A midfield, who don't know each other on the pitch. Playing a 5ft 8inch up top on his own, FFS.\nIt's Sunday 7.15pm. Why hasn't Frank and his coaching staff gone?\n805 Posted 15/01/2023 at 19:28:27\n806 Posted 15/01/2023 at 19:28:51\n807 Posted 15/01/2023 at 19:37:39\nWith that in mind I don't think we need to panic. There 9 poor teams in the league so we should be able to survive. I am not pleased with this position and would like us aiming for the top not the bottom.\nI don't like axing managers but Franks record at Chelsea and poor record with us, combined with his lack of experience makes the best option to move on. There is a vague hope that Potter leaves Chelsea and we could get him, a good long term solution.\nIf we do hold onto Frank then I am slightly worried he can't get the results we need and we become cut off and regulated. If we lose the next one to WH then we are in more trouble that an lot of use think. We won't get anything out of the next two. Worrying times ahead.\n808 Posted 15/01/2023 at 20:14:59\nOh yes, last time we won trophies, you can buy a DVD or ask ya dad or grandad! We must be realistic or the Moyes time will be a generation's greatest time supporting this club! If it takes Moyes, Allardyce, or Dyche to keep us up then fine. Staying in the league till the stadium is built is crucial in selling the club and moving forward.\nFor goodness sake, appoint a manager with experience getting clubs out of the bottom 3! Need to put the club first. It's desperation now! Snobbery of the appointment is not important!\n809 Posted 15/01/2023 at 21:03:07\nFrank has been loyal to under-performing players. I think both Coady and Tarkowski should be dropped for the next game. Mina to return if fit alongside Keane or Godfrey. Holgate can come in at right-back.\nInteresting on Sat that he did not bring on his 2 summer signings that cost the club 㿏 million in McNeil and Maupay.\n810 Posted 15/01/2023 at 21:27:19\nThey are the basics, you need from your players.\nHas he gone yet?\nIf the Everton Football Club don't act soon, it's going to get, really, really sour.\nThose idiots who follow players driving away from the ground, should be brought to task.\nBut again, every employee has a duty of care,from their employer approaching and leaving their workplace,.\n811 Posted 15/01/2023 at 21:33:40\n812 Posted 15/01/2023 at 21:39:11\nThat's pretty telling for me. I don't want Moyes back but I think he'd keep us up.\nMy heads a fucking shed\n813 Posted 15/01/2023 at 21:41:49\n814 Posted 15/01/2023 at 21:44:14\n815 Posted 15/01/2023 at 21:50:28\n816 Posted 15/01/2023 at 22:03:26\n817 Posted 15/01/2023 at 22:04:11\n818 Posted 15/01/2023 at 22:36:33\nI will say it again. Coaching skills.\nWe can get out of this rut, by getting rid of these no marks, ASAP.\nFrank is a one trick pony, who hasn't got a clue.\nThis quote is only my opinion.\nWho hasn't got a clue, like all fucking tories.\n819 Posted 15/01/2023 at 23:08:35\n820 Posted 15/01/2023 at 23:15:29\n821 Posted 15/01/2023 at 23:36:22\nIf he is not gone by now, it means they prefer to keep him for some reason, even if it means relegation, which is highly probable with him in charge.\nFiring him with little or no time left from the transfer window just doesn't make any sense!\n822 Posted 15/01/2023 at 00:05:30\nCan we please start with cutting out words like “fatâ€ and just refer to Lampard or Frank or whoever. Criticise, of course; name calling, no. It's going to be a long haul, I think, Blues. Take care and let's try to find some cosmic grooves together.\n823 Posted 16/01/2023 at 00:21:13\nThere's a difference between listening and hearing. Our board are not interested in either unless it suits their agenda.\n824 Posted 16/01/2023 at 00:44:56\n825 Posted 16/01/2023 at 01:10:59\nHad he not written such a response, I have no doubt whatsoever Frank would have been given the sack after yesterday's game, he has dug a hole for himself, so sack Frank and it makes his comments look silly at best.\nBy leaving Frank in charge, he is as good as saying the fans back him â€“ look at the coach welcome, the team and manager are getting. If we do go down, it was down to the fans backing Frank.\nIf Frank turns it around, again he can say he had faith in Frank, this is the corner we have pushed Moshiri into.\nFrank might turn it round, he may also take us down, but Frank's tactics and going with the same players every week, and calling on the same subs every week, is doing nothing but getting the same results.\nLike someone else mentioned, the two players who we bought after the Richarlison sale, neither came off the bench.\nEvery team we have played has made at least two subs, going into the second half, then when we are ready to bring on just one sub, the other team already have their third sub ready to come on.\nWith the five-sub rule, surely two subs minimum around the 60-minute mark should be a given, then use the other three if need be, but how many times have we played with a lone striker, defence have it all sorted, so bringing another striker on, and taking the other striker off, like-for-like and the defence just carry on, however, get two strikers together and it then gives the defence a different option, but I just cannot get my head around why he leaves the subs so late.\nSo there we have it, do we stick or twist?\n826 Posted 16/01/2023 at 03:38:10\nIt is just not the same every week. There have been some changes, but they have been for the worse. The four at the back against Brighton and the Iowbi role.\nGray was just marked and channelled against Southampton.\n827 Posted 16/01/2023 at 04:12:58\nHeadlock Gate, Kenwright Death Threats, Board Assassinations etc, all unfounded of course but people are gullible these days and believe what they read in the rags, and what gets reported on TV.\nDon't play into their hands, not you personally, but speaking to those who may be tempted to knee-jerk responses. The media although often looking for the scoop or the bad news story, which people will more readily cling to, and unfortunately tend to believe. Use the media to our advantage and soon the stories and lies that have emanated from the Board and Kenwright will be exposed.\nWithout being the Devil's Advocate, I fully understand the anger and frustration that has gotten our once great club, and brought it almost to its knees, but please keep the powder dry and the Board will expose themselves as the incompetents that they are.\n828 Posted 16/01/2023 at 08:58:36\nIf anything is going to make the players play worse it's making them nervous and too scared to do anything.\nThat is not supporting the team. You may feel he let the side down by giving away the free kick but if we all behaved like you nobody would play or indeed sign for us.\nYou have let the supporters down\nBrain dead mindless behaviour\n829 Posted 16/01/2023 at 09:24:58\nFrank smiling in his interview I find worrying\n830 Posted 16/01/2023 at 09:58:20\nThat we hardly have two pennies to rub together is probably the only reason Lampard is still here. Unless he decides to walk for the sake of his own health and reputation I guess he will still be here at the end of May even if we are relegated.\n831 Posted 16/01/2023 at 10:26:56\nEveryone knew that was a must-win - shame the players and manager didn't seem aware. I'm not saying they didn't try but some games you just have to find a way to win.\nBut then if you keep playing the same old players every week (even if you tweak formations/positions), you will get the same results. Lampard has to go now I think - he looks out of his depth and without a clue as to how to get a win.\nSad to see the players being harassed and verbally abused after the game though. Don't agree with that at all. People should be able to walk to their car in peace and drive home after work no matter how they played or what the result was. I bet those who had a go at them wouldn't like people doing the same to them when they were heading home after a day's work.\n832 Posted 16/01/2023 at 14:33:40\n833 Posted 16/01/2023 at 15:39:19\n834 Posted 16/01/2023 at 15:59:39\n835 Posted 16/01/2023 at 16:19:30\nI am sure after a good rest next season a London-based Championship club may offer you a way back into management, but you would be better off getting a pundits job on Sky.\n836 Posted 16/01/2023 at 16:22:25\nWe haven't competed for years and if reports are to be believed we have become an embrassment.\nMy only question, is Frank the one to bring us back up.\n837 Posted 16/01/2023 at 16:30:39\nIf we go down there'll be a massive loss of revenue, huge debts, stadium to pay for, numerous players on huge wages that no one else will want. No one will be buying this Club and will Moshri continue to put money in?\nAt the very least we will be likely to continue to make large losses (we won't be able to reduce our costs by enough to cover the revenue reduction for reasons above) and will continue to therefore be hindered by FFP.\nI'd say we are more likely to have to start a new Club from scratch like Wimbledon then come straight back up in the next few seasons.\nPer the Telegraph the Americans have called a halt to any negotiations with Moshri re takeover or investment.\n838 Posted 16/01/2023 at 16:55:27\nHow to ruin a football club spending half a billion, you couldn't make it up.\n839 Posted 16/01/2023 at 16:57:41\n840 Posted 16/01/2023 at 17:06:46\nHow can Sharp join the board, speaks volumes about him too, just like when he blanked my question years ago in one of the suites.\n841 Posted 16/01/2023 at 17:06:47\nWhat happens next is anybodies guess and getting to the point of not caring for the first time in 57 years of the old lady and afar.\nProtests and there have been plenty in them years were spontaneous not having to be organised. We saw what happens when you spit bile like this after the game\nWhat players can we attract now? What managers? Who is going to buy us? What you don't know neither do I so well done\n842 Posted 16/01/2023 at 17:31:16\nWhy are we constantly shoved off the ball, ref ignores and our player moans and groans and doesn't chase back!!\nThe opposition know they can run at our goal unmolested. and then, when we make the tackle, it's a dumb shove in the back like Gordon on Adams.\nThe players have no bottle and have given up.\nAnd don't tell me Iwobi played well on Saturday. Headless chicken again. We go sideways and backwards...\n843 Posted 16/01/2023 at 19:59:23\nThe club need to protect the players after matches. Police escort on a coach all together.\n844 Posted 16/01/2023 at 21:17:35\n845 Posted 16/01/2023 at 21:22:11\nMaybe Kenwright does know us Evertonians, and this was part of his overall plan to stop Moshiri from selling Everton?\nNothing is off the table when you have got to try and work out how deceitful bastards work.\n846 Posted 16/01/2023 at 22:42:47\n847 Posted 17/01/2023 at 04:09:58\nI mentioned this in a previous posting, looking at the stats Southampton gave away 19 fouls with 3 bookings Everton 7 fouls no bookings, so it shows which manager instructed his players, we have to win so don't hold back on effort.\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
