He’d be a brilliant addition to Mikel Arteta’s team.\n‘Out of the other Premier League clubs linked with Gittens, I’m not sure about Tottenham’s chances of signing him, or even Chelsea’s, as he’ll be wanting to play Champions League football next year, which is why I believe he will leave Dortmund at the end of this season.’\nGittens is unlikely to be the only German-based star on the move in the summer and Babbel believes Manchester City should look no further than Bayer Leverkusen Florian Wirtz in their attempts to find Kevin De Bruyne’s successor.\n‘Florian Wirtz would be a brilliant signing for Manchester City if they were to try to sign him this summer,’ Babbel said.\n‘He’s by far one of the best and most valuable players in the Bundesliga at the moment, along with Jamal Musiala. If Man City have the chance to sign him, they must go for it because he is different class.\n‘Is Florian Wirtz the natural successor to Kevin De Bruyne? Well, if you look at De Bruyne, I have the feeling he will be leaving Manchester City at the end of the season.\nMore Trending\n‘He’s different to how he’s been in recent years, he gives interviews where it seems as though he’s not happy anymore – ‘there’s too many games, it’s too tough…’\n‘Kevin De Bruyne will leave Man City in the summer, and I believe he will go to Saudi Arabia because he’ll earn so much money over there, he’ll have less stress than he does in England and can finish his career there.\n‘So, if De Bruyne does leave Man City this summer then Florian Wirtz would be a brilliant replacement, that’s for sure.’\nMORE: Steve Sidwell tells three Chelsea stars to ‘step up’ ahead of Aston Villa clash\nMORE: Arsenal eyeing transfer move for £66m Bundesliga striker\nMORE: Raphael Varane admits ‘surprise’ at Marcus Rashford decision before Manchester United exit",
