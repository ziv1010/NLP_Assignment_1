  "body_text": "Mikel Arteta has named the Arsenal summer signing who has ‘surprised’ him since joining the club.\nArsenal backed Arteta with a productive and impressive transfer window, spending more than £250m on new signings.\nViktor Gyokeres, Martin Zubimendi, Eberechi Eze, Noni Madueke, Cristhian Mosquera, Christian Norgaard, Kepa Arrizabalaga and Piero Hincapie all arrived at the Emirates Stadium.\nThe new recruits appear to be having the desired effect, with Arsenal currently three points clear at the top of the Premier League and joint-top of the Champions League.\nArteta admits he was ‘very happy’ with Arsenal’s transfer window and has explained what has ‘surprised’ him about new midfielder Martin Zubimendi.\nArsenal spent £60m to sign Zubimendi from Real Sociedad, 12 months after the Spain international almost joining Premier League champions Liverpool.\nLiverpool dropped out of the race to sign Zubimendi this summer but Arsenal faced competition from Real Madrid, who were keen to bring the Euro 2024 winner to the Bernabeu.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nAsked about Zubimendi and pundits likening the Arsenal star to Manchester City’s Ballon d’Or winner Rodri, Arteta told Marca: ‘I don’t like comparisons.\n‘I think ‘Zubi’ has to make his own way, and he’s doing so. Since he’s arrived, his impact on the team has been exceptional, and that’s very difficult.\n‘I’ve seen many midfielders reach the Premier League, coming from top positions in other leagues, and they’ve struggled; it’s taken them a year or two to become who they are.\n‘The speed and naturalness with which he’s adapting is surprising.\n‘We’ve given him confidence and a clear role, at all levels, including decisions we’ve made here with players who were there but are no longer here.\n‘We gave him space. And then, he feels comfortable with our style; it suits his way of playing.’\nAsked about the Real Madrid fans who feel aggrieved that Zubimendi ended up at Arsenal, Arteta added: ‘[Laughs] I can only say that… it’s good that we have him because he was a player that we needed to take a step forward as a team.’\nDiscussing Arsenal’s transfer window more generally, Arteta continued: ‘I’m happy with the signings.\n‘We’ve had a very good transfer window, learning from the past, with profiles we didn’t have and needed, and now it’s a matter of making everything work and each one making the other better.’\nArsenal beat Fulham 1-0 at the weekend to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League.\nThe Gunners’ impressive form, Liverpool’s wobble and Manchester City’s inconsistency has made Arsenal the favourites to become English champions for the first time since 2004.\n‘We take that pressure naturally,’ Arteta said when asked about Arsenal’s tag as Premier League favourites.\nMore Trending\n‘We’ve created high expectations through our work, and that’s part of elite football. Besides, these are things that arise outside the team and we can’t control them.\n‘We focus more on the day-to-day, ensuring the team is heading in the direction it needs to be so that by April or May, when everything is decided, we’re ready.’\nArsenal put their Premier League title charge to one side on Tuesday when they return to Champions League action against Atletico Madrid.\nDiego Simeone’s Atletico are currently fourth in La Liga, eight points behind leaders and arch-rivals Real Madrid.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: ‘You have my heart’ – Girlfriend of Stuart Pearce’s son leaves heartbreaking note at scene of death\nMORE: Theo Walcott confident Arsenal star can be ‘the difference’ in the Champions League\nMORE: Free agent striker training with Arsenal ahead of Atletico Madrid clash",
