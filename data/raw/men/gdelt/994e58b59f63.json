We always did,\" defender Joe Gomez said. \"But now when the finishing line is in sight it adds that extra emphasis. It’s special and hopefully it’s the first (trophy) of a few we can get.”\nReferences to Klopp's last dance have started to trend on social media, likening his Liverpool farewell to Michael Jordan's final season with the Chicago Bulls in 1998, when they won the NBA championship. The season was documented in the Netflix series, “The Last Dance.”\nSince Klopp was hired in 2015, he has transformed a sleeping giant into a force again. The League Cup was his eighth trophy, among them a full set of major trophies including the Premier League and Champions League.\nAnd Liverpool might not be finished. It leads the Premier League, and is still in the FA Cup and Europa League.\n“I couldn’t care less about my legacy. I’m not here to create one,” Klopp said on Sunday. “As a manager of a football club, you are there to do the job actually.”\nBut the League Cup final showed Klopp will leave the club in good shape. Seven of his players on the day were aged 21 or under. When Virgil van Dijk headed in the winner in the 118th minute, he had three academy players beside him.\n“We don’t want to get ahead of ourselves but we are in every competition and we are going to try to win every game,\" Gomez said. \"That’s the target and we will go again.\"\nBeside the players, Liverpool fans are savoring their final moments with Klopp.\nSupporters carried flags and banners with messages of thanks to their outgoing manager as they made the short walk from Wembley Park subway station to Wembley Stadium. Singing loudly, it was a party atmosphere long before kickoff and they are hoping for one long party before finally saying goodbye.\nMore in Sports\n“It has been a bit sad for everyone, but I think everyone now thinks we’re going to push on and do even better than we would have done (this season),” Liverpool fan Nick Knight told The Associated Press.\nHis father, Andrew, added: “I think he means everything (to Liverpool). Within a few weeks or months of him arriving it was obvious they were a perfect fit and the type of football he played — high energy, playing to the final whistle — it was everything as a Liverpool fan you wanted to see.”\nThe fans showed their appreciation long after the final whistle as they serenaded Klopp and his players on the field.\n“It’s not a problem if the manager leaves or whatever, (but) if these people would leave – our supporters – that would be a problem,” Klopp said. “But as long as they are the way they are, Liverpool Football Club will be fine and that’s the most important thing.\"\n___\nJames Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",
