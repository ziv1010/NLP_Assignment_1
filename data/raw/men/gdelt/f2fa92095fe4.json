It doesnt aid anyone or solve anything\" Fair point. The main reason for this is if you want them linked (e.g. provincial winners have an advantage going into the all Ireland series) then you have to finish one before starting the next. In the structure above you could definitely play the provincials and the league concurrently. I suppose the argument against this is fairness and player burnout, a team that does well in the knockout competitions is at a disadvantage in the league based competitions.\nMerging the provinces I think negates the argument that some provinces are at an advantage/disadvantage compared to others. And makes it more evenly balanced overall.\nNew&Improved (Leitrim) - Posts: 41 - 11/03/2023 15:07:44\n2463369\nLink\n0\n|\n|\nReplying To KillingFields: \"Why does every proposal put playing all competitions in their entirety before playing the next.\nSurely best format is like soccer with premier league and champions league and league cup/fa cup all played troughout the season I dont see how merging provincial competitions is better or necessary.

Hurling seems to have found the right number of games. 5 league and 5 championship. Football counties rejected a provincial round robin. The result is an All-Ireland round after a condensed provincial championship.

To add extra weeks for groups of 5, the league will have to reduce by a couple of weeks. Hurling will probably retain the current format for many years with only minor tweaks.
