Yet under the pressure of the occasion, Arsenal succumbed to a 2-0 defeat, leaving Manchester City top of the league and in control of winning a fourth successive title.\nNow, things could go from bad to worse for Mikel Arteta, as he looks to keep a group of players together who have been arguably the outstanding form side in English football since the turn of the year.\nSpanish outlet Fichajes claims that Jorginho could be about to depart the Emirates Stadium for Juventus this summer.\nThe Brazilian-born Italy international has been one of Arteta's trusted generals this season, playing most of the big games alongside Declan Rice – but was absent from the start yesterday, with a Champions League quarter-final second leg against Bayern Munich on the horizon this week.\nAt 32, the midfielder perhaps lacks the physicality to play twice a week. Still, losing the Euro 2020 on a free transfer would be a bitter blow to Arteta, given that Jorginho is one of the big leaders in this side.\nIn FourFourTwo's view, keeping Jorginho for another season makes a lot of sense – especially given the decline of Thomas Partey. It's now up in the air as to whether Arsenal can secure a new contract for the start, however, with no obviously indication one way or another as to whether it'll be agreed.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nJorginho is worth €15 million, according to Transfermarkt.\nMore Arsenal stories\nArsenal are about to replace Oleksandr Zinchenko following the Ukrainian's bad performance against Aston Villa. One wonderkid could be about to leave too, with Gabriel Jesus set for a departure.\nThe Gunners could sign a controversial striker, however, while Joshua Kimmich has been linked. Former vice-chairman David Dein, meanwhile, has shared a story of how the Invincibles would intimidate their opponents.\nMark White is the Digital Content Editor at FourFourTwo.
