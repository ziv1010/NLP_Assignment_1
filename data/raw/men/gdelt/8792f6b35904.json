He has since penned a contract extension with Brugge, which runs until 2029. He is an important player, having made 12 appearances across all competitions so far this term, including three in the Champions League.\nHowever, Liverpool haven’t been deterred by his new deal and are considering a bid of over €40m (£35m / $47m) for Ordonez. They would also be willing to offer him a salary of more than €3m (£2.6m / $3.5m), according to the report. It’s claimed that would be ‘close’ to what Konate earns at Anfield, and be a ‘huge’ increase from Ordonez’s current terms with Brugge.\nREAD MORE 😬 Florian Wirtz next?

This means the Eagles must sell him in January, or they’ll lose him for free next summer.\nBut the likelihood is that Liverpool will have to wait until the end of this term to sign the England star, and it is not guaranteed he chooses to join them.\nTransfer insider Dean Jones exclusively told TEAMtalk earlier this month: “I am told it is almost certain he will go at the end of the season rather than January. That is the preference.”\n“If you look at it from his point of view, he will never be in a better position to get the move of his dreams. As a free agent the world of football is his to choose from and as soon as the move to Liverpool fell through, that’s what the focus became.\n“Professionally it is better for him to leave as a free agent and personally it is better too.\n“He is going to get a very lucrative financial deal and can also very carefully choose his next step. This is a once in a lifetime moment to define his career with huge benefits.\n“He is very open minded about what comes next and is looking at the situation with a clean slate. Liverpool do not have the edge. He’ll be looking towards every option with intrigue.”\nDON’T MISS 🔴 Fabrizio Romano drops bombshell on Liverpool sacking Arne Slot\nLatest Liverpool news: FSG ‘plan’ / Vinicius Jr twist\nMeanwhile, reports suggest that Liverpool’s owners, FSG, have no plans to make a major signing in the January transfer window, after a summer of huge spending.\nDespite suffering four consecutive league defeats, the Reds’ hierarchy believe the squad is strong enough to bounce back and mount a Premier League title charge.\nIn other news, Real Madrid superstar Vinicius Junior is reportedly putting serious thought into leaving Real Madrid, and Liverpool are said to be one of the clubs interested.",
