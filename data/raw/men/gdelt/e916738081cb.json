  "body_text": "Gary Neville admits he ‘wishes he never said’ a brutal comment about former Chelsea and Arsenal defender David Luiz.\nLuiz enjoyed an impressive and trophy-laden career, picking up silverware at Premier League rivals Chelsea and Arsenal as well as Paris-Saint-Germain, Benfica and Flamengo.\nAcross two spells at Stamford Bridge, Luiz lifted the Premier League, Champions League and Europa League trophies as well as two FA Cups.\nIt was during Luiz’s first stint in west London that he attracted criticism from Manchester United and England legend Neville.\nFollowing a Chelsea defeat to Liverpool during the 2011-12 campaign, Neville said Luiz played like he was ‘being controlled by a 10-year-old on a PlayStation’.\nEight-time Premier League winner Neville still regrets making the comment and says it was a ‘cheap shot’ at a player who went on to represent Brazil 57 times.\n‘I can think of a couple of things,’ Neville said on Sky Bet’s Stick to Football when asked if he regretted anything he has said as a pundit.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

I wish I never said ‘billion dollar bottle jobs’ about Chelsea.\n‘They’re harsh lines that stain a group of players. David Luiz never got rid of that really.\n‘It’s a cheap shot, it borders on a cheap shot. There’s not many things but those come to mind.’\nResponding to Neville’s admission, Arsenal legend Ian Wright said: ‘It was mean, that. The David Luiz comment felt mean.’\nAnother time Neville can remember second guessing his previous comments was when he bumped into ex-Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius at an Italian hotel.\nKarius spent six years at Anfield but is remembered for his poor performance in the 2018 Champions League final in which Real Madrid beat Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool.\n‘[Loris] Karius, the Liverpool goalkeeper, the young lad – I’ve been quite direct about him for a period of two to three months,’ Neville added.\n‘Liverpool were getting better under Jurgen Klopp and I remember saying that they’ll never ever win the league with that guy [Karius] in the net.\nMore Trending\n‘It’s a strong line for a young goalkeeper. It was probably true five months later back in the Champions League final.\n‘One time I went to Italy and went to a hotel. I walked into the gym for a session and there was just this big bloke lifting massive weights – it was Karius!\n‘He could have done many things there and could have had a go at me. It went right through my head on what I said about him, and I know he would’ve known that.\n‘But he said, “Nice to see you” and I felt guilty bumping into someone I’ve given a harsh line to.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Marcus Rashford’s preferred next club revealed as Manchester United prepare exit\nMORE: Mikel Arteta makes brutal final transfer decision on £25 million Arsenal star\nMORE: Gabriel Jesus reveals what he told Arsenal teammate to inspire hat-trick heroics",
