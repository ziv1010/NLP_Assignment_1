  "body_text": "What a 2023 it has been for Lennard Maloney. On Thursday, the 23-year-old midfield received his first call-up to Gregg Berhalter’s U.S. men’s national team.\n“Playing for the United States is one of my biggest dreams,” he told AmericanSoccerNow in 2018. “If Germany is possible, I will play for Germany. But somewhere in my heart, I want to play for the United States. I don’t know what it is. It’s just there.”\nAdvertisement\nSo, an ambition has been realised, but this is just the latest highpoint in a six months full of peaks.\nBack in June, he was part of FC Heidenheim’s miracle promotion to the German Bundesliga. Since this season began, he has also been ever-present in a team manfully punching above its weight.\nHeidenheim is just a speck on the map. It is a town deep in south Germany, just north of Munich, that is home to 50,000 people. Its football team is no bigger. They play in a stadium that holds 15,000 and were playing at the fourth level of German football just 15 years ago. To emphasise just how far out of their weight class they currently are, Maloney is actually the first player in club history to be called up to a senior international squad.\nBut this has been a season of firsts. They have never played in the Bundesliga before, but have taken to it well and have begun to bruise some egos. At the beginning of September, Maloney and Heidenheim mounted a stirring comeback against Borussia Dortmund, retrieving a 2-2 draw in the Westfalenstadion. Victory over Werder Bremen followed two weeks later and, most recently, FCH beat Union Berlin 1-0, in a defiant performance against a team who are playing in this season’s Champions League. Union had the better of the chances at Voith Arena, but Maloney was arguably Heidenheim’s best player, as they survived heavy pressure and a siege of crosses.\nMaloney’s part in that characterised both who he is as a player and the spirit with which he plays. Nominally a midfielder, he has the build, temperament and awareness to play deeper. As Union attacked the penalty box, he operated as an extra centre-back, dropping into Heidenheim’s defensive line to win header upon header, and help to block up whatever space appeared. The victory was their second of the season and it took them above Werder Bremen, above Borussia Monchengladbach and level on points with Eintracht Frankfurt. It is territory that Heidenheim should not even be in.\nAdvertisement\nMaloney has had a circuitous journey to reach this point. He was born in Berlin, to a German mother and a U.S. Air Force veteran father, and joined Union Berlin’s academy when he was 13. He moved to Borussia Dortmund in 2020 but, despite making a Bundesliga appearance — as a substitute for Mats Hummels in the late autumn of 2021 — he would spend those two years with the club’s u23 side, who play in the 3.Liga, Germany’s third tier. Then, in 2022, he joined Heidenheim on a free transfer.\nPromotion would follow immediately and in scarcely believable fashion. Heidenheim scored a 100th-minute goal in their final game of the 2022-23 season to leapfrog Hamburg and win the 2.Bundesliga. At full time, goalkeeper Kevin Muller held his infant son in his arms and wept. Frank Schmidt, who has coached the team since 2007 and is the longest serving manager in German football history, led a wild and uninhibited celebration as the rest of Germany looked on, rubbing its eyes in disbelief. Almost immediately — universally and not without good cause — they were written off. They would enjoy their time in the top flight, everyone wrote and predicted, but would be no match for the teams within it.\nThat has so far not been the case – and that is the context in which to place Maloney. As a younger player, he was described in progressive terms — as a defensive player who could carry the ball forward and use it well. But he is no artisan at Heidenheim. He is an underdog and a fighter — a fortifying player for whatever needs to be toughened. He does not provide much of an attacking contribution, but that is not his job. Nor will it be why Berhalter has selected him. Instead, he will have watched Maloney function as part of a deep-lying side who defend in numbers, who play quickly and directly up the pitch, and who are developing a reputation for being far harder to beat than they logically should be.\nBerhalter is seeking players who may be able to fill the shoes of the injured Tyler Adams, who is known for his world-class defensive actions if not for his attacking contributions. Adams, who captained the U.S. in Qatar, did not miss a qualifier in the last World Cup cycle and was considered maybe the most irreplaceable player in the squad, but a hamstring has sidelined him for some time now and a recent setback looks set to keep him out longer.\n“It gives us an opportunity to have a Plan B when and if Tyler isn’t available,” Berhalter said Thursday.\nAdvertisement\nThe depth chart behind Adams is hardly set in stone. The only natural No. 6 is 22-year-old Johnny Cardoso, who starts for Internacional in Brazil. Berhalter has deputized Celta de Vigo midfielder Luca de la Torre in the role, but he is more comfortable further up the field. On Thursday, Berhalter acknowledged he may drop Yunus Musah into the deeper No. 6 spot, a role he has played recently at AC Milan, and insert an attacking midfielder like Gio Reyna or Malik Tillman as a more traditional No. 10. But Maloney now gives him another option. Berhalter mentioned that Maloney has the most distance covered in the Bundesliga as a central midfielder, but its the way he embodies Heidenheim’s fight that stuck out.\nDistilling Maloney’s individual virtues from that team identity is difficult. But that is precisely the point. He is what they need him to be, regardless of what his broader capabilities are. He is a ball-winner and stealer, and a formidable opponent in the air. A brick in their wall.\n“What really attracted the staff to him is how he plays the game with really a lot of emotion, with a lot of passion,” Berhalter said. “You see him clapping for his teammates, you see him going into tackles, a really committed player, really team-orientated player, and we’re excited to have him into camp and see what he can do.”\n(Photo: Heiko Becker/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
