  "body_text": "Everton 3 - 0 Doncaster Rovers\nSean Dyche includes the three new summer signings yet to be handed their full Everton debuts in the team to face Doncaster Rovers in the Carabao Cup while Seamus Coleman and James Garner return following injury.\nJames Tarkowski is rested in an effort to get him fully fit for the weekend, while Paterson, Branthwaite and Chermiti are still out injured.\nThe visitors kicked off but Everton had plenty of the early possession, Coleman swinging in the first cross that was repelled. Beto won a free-kick that was wasted and it needed a fine tackle by Iroegbunam to get the ball back.\nFrom a decent ball forward by Mykolenko, McNeil eventually played a fine cross to Beto that he could not convert, sliding in with the goal at his mercy. A slack backpass avoided a repeat of Pickford's weekend error. Garner tried to play in Beto but the ball didn't reach him.\nGarner played forward to Lindstrøm but his cross was blocked behind for a corner, taken short and then wasted when the ball back to Lindstrøm found him offside. McNeil needed to dribble past a defender, but couldn't and Doncaster built half-decent attack.\nAt the other end, a McNeil shot was deflected behind for another Everton corner, delivered well by McNeil and fingertipped away by Lawlor under pressure. Everton looked to build but Ndiaye was inexplicably offside.\nFrom a Doncaster free-kick, Senior sent a fine shot goalward that Pickford launched himself to turn away.\nBeto got the ball out to Lindstrøm but his cross was poor, going behind. McNeil tried another shot from the edge of the Doncaster area, the ball hitting Beto. McNeil delivered a ross too far in front of Beto but close enough to Lawlor that he needed to push it behind for a corner, played to the far post but defended away.\nDoncaster got themselves in a right pickle at the back but Everton couldn't profit. Then Mykolenko and Pickford conspired to gift the visitors a corner through miscommunication when dealing with a high ball.\nSenior dragged down Beto at the expense of a yellow card and dangerous free-kick, Lindstrøm seeming to pick out Beto who completely missed it. Garner then crossed in well for Beto but the ball came off him and away from goal.\nNdiaye got down the right and crossed in for Garner to place his shot toward the lower corner but it was blocked. A corner but Lindstrøm was dragged away from Lawlor into the net. When the corner came over, it was headed back nicely to Garner who volleyed onto the post!\nThe play in the first half had been largely shapeless and scrappy from both sides with many a turnover, and inspiring only that classic cliche: you could not tell which side was from the Premier League.\nThe second half just continued with poor play all over until Lindstrøm laid the ball nicely for Iroegbunam to strike goalward, with Dwight McNeil apparently getting the final touch. Everton had finally scored their first goal of the new season.\nLindstrøm played forward to Beto but he just could not keep possession of the ball, just running into trouble, and not for the first time. Garner drove down the inside right channel and powered his shot across goal. Ndiaye attacking down the left channel saw his shot blocked for a corner that didn't really come off.\nNdiaye skipped away from his marker and crossed perfectly onto the once of Beto but he could only glance it well wide when it looked easier to burst the net and it was time for some substitutions, Young getting booked almost immediately after he came on.\nHurst just didn't hit his shot strong enough to beat Pickford. At the other end, Ndiaye drove forward and fired low to beat Lawlor in off the near post and score Everton's second.\nMcNeil then drove down the middle and saw his shot tipped over. A Doncaster corner yielded a free header on target, blocked clear. Some nice interplay building around the Doncaster area ended with Harrison blasting over.\nFinally, a flowing passing move, McNeil to Mykolenko, ended with Beto poking in the third goal. Everton players could finally relax a little and start to express themselves, knocking the ball around with unaccustomed accuracy and aplomb.\nBut O'Brien was called for a softish free-kick and it was headed over Pickford's bar. At the other end, McNeil wellied one well wide as 3 minutes were added at the end.\nEverton: Pickford, Coleman (67' Young [Y:69']), Keane, O'Brien, Mykolenko, Garner (66' Gueye), Iroegbunam [Y:58'] (85' Armstrong), Lindstrøm (66' Harrison), McNeil, Ndiaye (79' Dixon), Beto.\nSubs not Used: Virginia, Holgate, Doucouré, Calvert-Lewin.\nDoncaster Rovers: Lawlor, Nixon (56' Sterry), Olowu, McGrath, Senior [Y:37'] (75' Sharp), Bailey, Kelly (64' Broadbent), Molyneux, Westbrooke (63 Sbarra), Gibson (46' Hurst), Ironside.\nSubs not Used: Sharman-Lowe, Anderson, Yeboah, Close.\nKick-off: 7:45 pm, Tuesday 27 August 2024\nReferee: Simon Ross\nAttendance: 37,245\nThis game is being streamed via Sky Sports+ in the UK (Channel 412 and the Red button, also on the Sky Sports App on smartphones and tablets)\nReader Comments (105)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Will Garner and Coleman last the 90 minutes?\n2 Posted 27/08/2024 at 18:55:18\n3 Posted 27/08/2024 at 18:59:13\n4 Posted 27/08/2024 at 18:59:27\nI was at that game. A 21 year old Ian Snodin played sweeper for Doncaster and looked a real prospect.\n5 Posted 27/08/2024 at 19:03:21\nApologies if this has been mentioned before but there are new rules for the Carabao Cup when it comes to the 3rd round draw. I appreciate that the teams playing in Europe enter the competition in the 3rd tound but wasn't aware of the other changes such as the 2 bowls of teams and 2 stages of the draw as follows:\n'The third round draw has been tweaked for this season and here is all you need to know.\nCarabao Cup third-round draw: Changes\nThis season will see the Carabao Cup draw made in two stages.\nThe first part involves the teams in the Europa League and Champions League.\nThey will be placed in bowl one, and the other 26 sides are put into bowl two.\nTeams in bowl one [Manchester City, Arsenal, Manchester United, Tottenham, Liverpool and Aston Villa] cannot be drawn against each other in the third round.\nThey are pre-drawn to determine if they'll be at home or away and separated into six different ties.\nThen, the first six teams out of the hat in pot two will be drawn to play one of the six European sides.\nChelsea are also in European competition this year, but they are between legs in their qualifying campaign, so can't be included with the other European teams.'\n6 Posted 27/08/2024 at 19:03:43\nYou mean August 30 2023?????\nRemember, Beto ........ ?\n7 Posted 27/08/2024 at 19:07:50\nWe might have a little discussion about right-back, but giving SC game time rather than Dixon seems sound to me in this particular game.\n8 Posted 27/08/2024 at 19:09:07\n9 Posted 27/08/2024 at 19:09:45\nBeto, let's be honest, is a weird player - but he can certainly cause problems and it'll be good if he can push his claims for a starting berth ahead of DCL. Good to have some competition.\nEarly goal to settle the nerves please.\nCOYB.\n10 Posted 27/08/2024 at 19:10:20\n11 Posted 27/08/2024 at 19:15:58\nBut presumably he has picked a team that he thinks will win and there for equipped to deal with Doncaster. Is he suggesting by his actions then that these players are League 2 standard players?\n12 Posted 27/08/2024 at 19:37:11\nLong summer lay off, as proven against Spurs!\n13 Posted 27/08/2024 at 19:40:39\nI hope with Garner back, it's 4-3-3.\n14 Posted 27/08/2024 at 19:45:51\nDepends on how tight things get…\n15 Posted 27/08/2024 at 20:35:21\nLindstrÃ¸m lightweight, Ndiaye not quite getting into the game.\nPenalties to follow…\n16 Posted 27/08/2024 at 20:35:57\nWe're still in this!\n17 Posted 27/08/2024 at 20:39:25\nWhy is The Jam song That's Entertainment in my head?\n18 Posted 27/08/2024 at 20:42:02\n19 Posted 27/08/2024 at 20:47:26\nNice to see the new boys on the pitch and we should see them in the 2nd half too, given Dyche's aversion to early subs. Hoping for something special out of at least one of them.\n20 Posted 27/08/2024 at 20:54:05\nVery worrying.\n21 Posted 27/08/2024 at 20:58:28\n22 Posted 27/08/2024 at 21:02:23\nWhen did we last smash anyone?\n23 Posted 27/08/2024 at 21:04:03\nAs long as Rovers don't bring on someone called Roy, we should be ok\n24 Posted 27/08/2024 at 21:09:39\n(phew, think I got away with it).\n25 Posted 27/08/2024 at 21:13:11\n26 Posted 27/08/2024 at 21:17:14\nYoung getting booed on is not a good look, no matter how much people dislike him. We're up 1-0 for fuck's sake, some of our \"supporters\" are just determined to be miserable pessimists.\n27 Posted 27/08/2024 at 21:19:39\nNow we're still in this.\n28 Posted 27/08/2024 at 21:30:06\n29 Posted 27/08/2024 at 21:36:15\n30 Posted 27/08/2024 at 21:36:35\n31 Posted 27/08/2024 at 21:40:26\n\"What's Our Name?\"\nUTFTs!\n32 Posted 27/08/2024 at 21:42:06\nTim is looking better each game, but LindstrÃ¸m looked a bit lightweight. I thought O'Brien looked very composed.\n33 Posted 27/08/2024 at 21:52:44\n34 Posted 27/08/2024 at 21:54:55\n35 Posted 27/08/2024 at 21:57:51\n36 Posted 27/08/2024 at 22:01:13\n37 Posted 27/08/2024 at 22:03:33\n38 Posted 27/08/2024 at 22:07:59\n39 Posted 27/08/2024 at 22:08:17\nNow for a repeat on Saturday and ill to try and stay off toffeweb beforehand, so as not to spoil my positive thoughts.\n40 Posted 27/08/2024 at 22:08:25\nHopefully some confidence built up going into the Bournemouth game.\n41 Posted 27/08/2024 at 22:08:45\nLindstrom showed why he shouldn't start. Whereas Ndiaye showed why he should\nTim is a terrific addition and Keane & O'Brien looked composed together\n42 Posted 27/08/2024 at 22:10:38\n43 Posted 27/08/2024 at 22:12:56\nCan only improve now as new players bed in, there are some positive signs.\n44 Posted 27/08/2024 at 22:17:29\nI love Beto but deary me! He has no special awareness at all and seems to be in a constant state of falling over. Is there a striker in the club?\nNdiaye has great feet and low centre of gravity. If we can work on his upper body strength we could have a real player there.\nTim needs experience but has the right attitude. OBrian should force his way in either for JB in 4 days time or Tarks by seasons end.\nTake the happiness of it all for now thanks!\n45 Posted 27/08/2024 at 22:24:25\n46 Posted 27/08/2024 at 22:25:22\n47 Posted 27/08/2024 at 22:27:41\nAs Evertonians we love the effort! I'm on holiday in a Portugal bar tonight watching the club I've supported since 1984. All I wanted tonight was a win and Beto goal. He ain't class and ain't pretty but he gives a sh*t and got what he deserved for the effort tonight.\nI've watched Everton since the 80's, nothing more exciting than seeing the new boys on day one. Dyche held them back but including pre-season they've all now more than contributed which bodes well.\nCOYE\nPs Lyndon if your reading - love the Pod and would love to speak with you\n48 Posted 27/08/2024 at 22:35:37\n49 Posted 27/08/2024 at 22:41:41\nOther posters will say, they knew that after a handful of appearances, but I had hopes he could adapt to English football and justify his fee.\nUnfortunately he just has too many deficiencies in his game... I'd still keep him over Maupay though, and I still think he will get 6 or 7 goals this season which is probably the same as DCL would get for us.\n50 Posted 27/08/2024 at 22:47:36\n51 Posted 27/08/2024 at 22:50:48\nOur DoF is low rent and not fit for purpose despite being paid elite level money. The manager is scrambling and doing an average job in the circumstances, but everyone thinks he's punching, in the circumstances. He isn't! That's why we're in this mess, because it's been repeating for well over a decade and managers, players and staff walk away very rich and laugh at the complete incompetence that allows this to happen.\n52 Posted 27/08/2024 at 22:52:31\n53 Posted 27/08/2024 at 22:59:10\n54 Posted 27/08/2024 at 23:00:10\n55 Posted 27/08/2024 at 23:02:37\n56 Posted 27/08/2024 at 23:06:11\nWe played a bit of on-the-ground football. In the first half that seemed to be an alien concept to a number of players, but they grasped it a little better as the match progressed and the opposition tired.\nNdiaye looks like he may be the player I hoped we had signed, it was a pleasure to see someone running with the ball at speed and trying a few tricks.\nI credit Beto for being enthusiastic, but thought he was awful.\n57 Posted 27/08/2024 at 23:10:33\nAlso, if we do manage to bring in Trippier on Friday, and a player who can play both full back positions, it should make Young's role redundant for a large part, when you think that Patterson or Coleman should be ahead of him if Trippier was injured.\nThat all said, I bet Dyche would still find a way to shoe-horn Young into his side.\n58 Posted 27/08/2024 at 23:11:53\nIt took a little while to get going, only natural considering a new line-up but it was comfortable in the end.\nColeman must have been under 100% but yes I too question why Young was brought on ahead of Dixon.\nYoung has become a liability and should only be used very sparingly. Holgate must now realize his time is up if he couldn't get into the action.\nIndaiye has some flair and Tim is coming along nicely but Harrison flatters to deceive.\nLindstrom may take more time to fit in.\n59 Posted 27/08/2024 at 23:15:49\nOK:\nBeto\nLindstrÃ¸m\nChermitti\nColeman\nYoung\nGueye\nDoucoure\nHolgate\nMaupay\nKeane\nDCL\nMykolenko\nNew DOF\nWe will need to get busy over the next three days - and without a DOF - to ship this shower of shite out of our club and replace them with the players Mike recommended to take their places.\nCould either Stonsey or Woaney be a temporary DOF while we get all these deals done and over the line before the window shuts?\n60 Posted 27/08/2024 at 23:15:59\n61 Posted 27/08/2024 at 23:17:07\nHowever play like that in a PL game and we'll get hammered\nWe are still turning the ball over cheaply in the middle of the park and PL teams will take advantage of that\nThought O'Brien andI Illman did well.\nLindstrom surprised how poor he was hopefully he'll bulk up a bit as he seemed easy to play against tonight\nThought big Tim did well.\nWhile he was on the pitch my MOM goes to Garner. Thought he showed energy and effort. Head up all tge time looking for the forward\nA win was imperative for us tonight, however, Saturday is as important, if not more\n62 Posted 27/08/2024 at 23:32:59\nTim stood out again, O'Brian played well and the team played some decent football after the result was settled. No complaints after a 3-0 win which might give the players some confidence v Bournemouth on Saturday but obviously will be a more difficult opposition than league two Doncaster, nevertheless it was nice to come away from Goodison with smiles on our faces.\n63 Posted 27/08/2024 at 23:43:12\nI was at the game and you didn't miss anything in the first half.\nI thought we must be playing Real Madrid the way we were standing off them, and the amount of times we played the ball back to Pickford, I thought we were attacking the Gwladys Street end.\nOverall we were far better the second half. Ndiaye, O'Brien and Iroegbunam have to start on Saturday. I'm undecided about LindstrÃ¸m, he looked lightweight but showed glimpses of his potential and did set up the first goal. It's a disgrace if it's given to McNeill and not Iroegbunam.\n64 Posted 27/08/2024 at 23:59:17\nJames Garner was very poor, but first game back for a while, lets him partially off the hook. LindstrÃ¸m was either below par tonight and too easily knocked off the ball.\nBeto tries hard but often looks like his roller boots are on the wrong feet, spending more time on the grass than a hungry horse. Took his goal well but don't think we can rely on him as our main outlet up front against superior opposition !\nRoman Dixon, looked good again, as opposed to Ashley Young who was awful and could easily have picked up another yellow in addition to the one he got anyway. Harrison Armstrong looked a good un too.\nJack Harrison again epitomised the Duracell Bunny 'all work with little play' to complement his running. Gana was Gana, okay but showing his age, but a reliable stalwart to call upon.\nSaturday will be a much stiffer test but hopefully this game has instilled some self-belief and confidence.\n65 Posted 28/08/2024 at 01:33:37\nGarner and McNeil were pretty poor and Beto must practice missing the same barn door as Calvert-Lewin.\nGood performances from Iroegbunam, Ndiaye and O'Brien.\nWhat, on earth, was the thinking behind bringing Young on?\n66 Posted 28/08/2024 at 01:49:35\nConfidence, match fitness. Which is worrying.\n67 Posted 28/08/2024 at 02:40:30\nXI v Bournemouth: Pickford, Young, Keane, Tarkowski, Mykelenko, Gana, Garner, McNeil, Harrison, Doucoure, Beto\n68 Posted 28/08/2024 at 04:10:48\nWill be very interesting to see what happens with Ndiaye. He's such an obvious selection in a team that has no-one who will run with the ball and commit players.\nBut he won't defend much.\nOver to you, Mr Dyche.\n69 Posted 28/08/2024 at 04:35:06\nNot seen him play enough to know, but does that mean he is not particularly good at it (some just aren't) or he's just not got the right attitude?\nFor the amount we pay we must be able to pick up the odd gifted footballer and athletic specimen that is also prepared to do the hard slog, and that type of player has to be Thelwell's target above all else.\n70 Posted 28/08/2024 at 04:53:08\nIronman continues to impress and in fairness to Beto he was manhandled all night and the ref largely let them get away with it and, although he missed a nailed-on header and was clumsy on the ball, he certainly occupied their defenders and made space for others.\nJake O'Brien looked solid and Jarradlike with his command in the air and blocked a couple of on target shots.\nSurely Sean Dyche cannot drop the new boys for Saturday. We look far more attack-minded with them in and hopefully Seamus is fit for that with Dixon on standby. Even Dyche must realize Ashley Young has now become a 2 yellow card liability in every game.\n71 Posted 28/08/2024 at 07:29:26\nIf so, I'd love to hear their reasons why as this is quite possibly the most mystifying continued selection of a player I've ever seen in in 34 years of going to Goodison!\nIt's just bizarre.\n72 Posted 28/08/2024 at 07:50:17\nO'Brien played well enough to stay in, along with Ndiaye, LindstrÃ¸m to a lesser degree, but I will be surprised, even flabbergasted, if Dyche keeps them all in.\n73 Posted 28/08/2024 at 07:51:33\nHaving read reports and comments, much pessimism has turned a little hopeful. Which is a blessed relief.\nTo address the Mike Price controversy, my observations are that his assessments are generally correct. Thelwell is a complete wage thief and a useless DoF. Who here has a copy of his book? Who knows anyone who has? Who has heard of anyone who has?\nThe Players. Yes, we know their limitations. On occasions, some reach the dizzy heights of premier league standard. But the constant struggle with relegation year after year after year coupled with failure to recruit a quarter decent player, let alone a few to drag the standard up, has taken its toll.\nThe manager may be encouraging passing. But as we see, unlike our players, they really aren't up to that. In spurts maybe. But not an entire half. As the enigmatic loved and hated Cloughie once said, \"Once that whistle blows, all tactics go out the window.\" Some of Mr Price's assessments are well wide of the mark.\nHis lack of solution to the obvious undermines the post.\nGod knows who will start Saturday. I would leave out Calvert-Lewin, Doucoure, Young and give the main group that started, another bite. Bournemouth have lost their talisman and this can be taken advantage of.\nBut then, it is Everton.\n74 Posted 28/08/2024 at 08:09:56\nI think you're looking for a unicorn.\nThe player who takes on the opposition, scores goals, creates for teammates... while also tracking back, throwing in goal saving challenges and maintaining a disciplined defensive shape doesn't exist.\nEven if they did, you'd probably ask them to save their energy to do the thing they're most effective at.\nThis is my issue with the current selection. We seem to want the chasing, the harrying... and then expect there's enough left to finish clinically. It doesn't happen.\n75 Posted 28/08/2024 at 09:45:01\nApparantly it's what's known as “taking one for the team”.\nI haven't seen the game so apologies if that's not accurate.\n76 Posted 28/08/2024 at 09:56:16\nWe were only opened up because Young himself miscontrolled the ball with his head and allowed the player to rob the ball off him.\nTerrible player but still no excuse for the morons to boo him last night when he came on.\n77 Posted 28/08/2024 at 10:23:11\nStop buying rubbish and putting them on very expensive contracts making them liabilities that are impossible to shift.\nPaul Ferry's very clever post #59 listed lots of players and, apart from Calvert-Lewin who wants out, none of them are assets.\n78 Posted 28/08/2024 at 10:23:40\nLindstrÃ¸m doesn't look ready. Beto reminds me of Doucoure from a footballing skills point of view. We overpaid. O'Brien looks to be a good understudy and possibly even replacement for Tarkowski.\nThe real eye opener was Ndiaye. Okay, this was against low-level opposition, but he has a spark we just don't have in the rest of the team. I think he needs to start in the Doucoure position, and would give us a great deal more penetration and perhaps make Calvert-Lewin look better. We won't beat many Premier League teams without the threat he brings.\n79 Posted 28/08/2024 at 10:27:32\nYou just wrote the job description of James Rodriguez as seen by many. Alas, no one can fulfill that expectation (or demand?) The game against Spurs was just that, chase and harry, like a team of 8-year-olds running every which way, no structure, plan or tactical savvy.\nYou couldn't actually pinpoint the areas of concern or failure as it was evident in every department.\n80 Posted 28/08/2024 at 10:47:58\nI think you would be hard-pressed to find any Evertonian who actually wants to see the long past his sell-by date, Ashley Young, in a blue shirt.... but he is.\nThe question I would like to ask is: Why do people think it's a good idea to continue hammering away at him? Does this destructive element within our fan base think that is in any way helpful?\nI'm in accord with those who think Beto has been a very poor buy and may not be up to the required standard but, if Calvert-Lewin moves in the next couple of days (a strong possibility), this is the guy we will be depending on to score or force the goals necessary to stay up. In what way does it help to keep battering away? He needs encouragement. How can it help an already limited player to destroy his confidence?\nI read the comments of the admirable Rob on the Euston station thread. He (as always) fiercely defends his club. He and other quite rightly went to some lengths to remind us all that the Kopite behaviour is ten times worse than that of our own few idiots, but my take on it is this: For all their obnoxious gobshitery, their vile chants and loutish behaviour is usually directed at somebody else. Not themselves.\nI'm all for fans coming on to post-match threads, or criticising players in time honored tradition in the pub after the match, but this growing trend of battering them during the game or worse, before a ball is even kicked?\nBooing a player who is representing our club onto the pitch? Please somebody. Anybody! Explain to me. What the fuck is all that about?\n81 Posted 28/08/2024 at 11:12:29\nIt's basically emotion, gone wrong. Without emotion, few would spend their money watching the dross we serve up week after week. The rational thing would be to support another team.\n82 Posted 28/08/2024 at 11:19:19\nHowever... he is a striker, strikers are paid to score; he did.\n83 Posted 28/08/2024 at 11:38:13\nAgree with the assessment on Ndiaye. His addition to the squad leaves me thinking that there was another option that Dyche wanted the club to pursue but the club chose Ndiaye and he is not Dyche's type of player at all.\nThat can be the only explanation as to why he hasn't been part of his plans in the Premier League so far…\n84 Posted 28/08/2024 at 11:49:25\n85 Posted 28/08/2024 at 12:06:16\n86 Posted 28/08/2024 at 12:48:42\nMaybe January! Although I have never been an advocate of players, or managers, returning to any club really they rarely pan out or emulate their first stint. I do believe though it may well be different in Richarlison's case, but would Dyche be able to get the best out of him?\n87 Posted 28/08/2024 at 12:54:02\nDave @80, well said. As long as the players are on the pitch and giving their all during a match, we are supposed to help them gain confidence and in return they'll be even more up for it. Yes, it's special times in this condition the club is in, then the more so we need this from the fans.\n88 Posted 28/08/2024 at 13:19:59\n89 Posted 28/08/2024 at 13:23:53\nI don't see the comparison with Beto though, as he actually offers something to the team. No matter how limited that contribution may be.\nUnlike Young who, as far as I can see, offers zero to the team yet is still selected at the expense of others who could actually develop and give something to this club in the future.\n90 Posted 28/08/2024 at 13:50:34\nEven when the crowd were baying for blood at Brentford and Norwich during the final days of the Benitez regime, but that was more aimed at the then-manager rather than the players. I'm glad on both occasions there were a lot of stewards and Police stood in front of us as that could easily have gotten out of hand such was the anger.\n91 Posted 28/08/2024 at 14:10:28\nI'm glad we won but the football is horrible, ugly to watch. Dinosaur football.\n92 Posted 28/08/2024 at 15:04:46\nSo I don't see anything to be upset about last night.\nYes we can play better, the football isn't going to win any sexy prizes and could of been more than 3.\nBeto is a bit of a mystery. He put himself about, he seems to get more chances than Calvert-Lewin, admitted this is not the Premier League.\nI think because of his limited playing time he's rushing and snatching at things. A run in the team may just calm him down. He took his goal well, but could've had a hat-trick on the night.\nIroegbunam was good in the middle, Ndiaye got better in second half and looked the most positive. I thought LindstrÃ¸m looked out of place on the wing. Watching him off the ball he wasn't looking to get in behind, is he better central?\nI don't think Bournemouth will be scared after this, but it's something to build on.\n93 Posted 28/08/2024 at 17:00:08\nThe reviews on Lindstrom's previous seasons are that he is tremendously creative in the center of the park and essentially nonproductive on the wing -- to me he looked slow and diffident out there. The one time he was able to get into the middle with space, he laid on a lovely ball for Tim's shot. Dyche needs to find space for him there, not out on the touchline.\nNdiaye is a lot of fun to watch and his confidence is massive. He is careless with the ball -- his first six touches went to Doncaster players, and a better opponent would have exacted a price for that -- but he clearly brings qualities that Duke cannot, and his finish was elegant.\nTim is dazzling me. He turns on the ball better than anybody I've seen in a blue shirt in recent years besides James Rodriguez. He has a lot to learn about defensive positioning, but his tackling is outstanding. To get him plus £50M in rough exchange for Onana is sheer brilliance from Thelwell.\nAnd Jake O'Brien showed terrific pace and tremendous self-possession. Another excellent pickup, although once Branthwaite returns I suspect we will see little of him this season.\n94 Posted 28/08/2024 at 20:08:19\nAdmittedly he is a tryer, can disrupt a back four, but that's about as far as it goes. On the other points, I have always failed to understand, especially with Dyche, why certain players are bought because they have certain strengths, and are most comfortable in a certain position. Then he proceeds to play them in a different role!\nMy other observation regarding ToffeeWeb, when we win, maybe not a resounding one, but a win nevertheless, without scintillating football, but a welcome one. There are very few posts on the subject. My question is, are most TW'ers only happy when they are moaning, after a defeat? :-)\n95 Posted 28/08/2024 at 20:15:10\nSome are even moaning over a win last night, mate.\n96 Posted 28/08/2024 at 20:18:42\n14-15 - 3 out of 15\n15-16 - 4\n16-17 - 4\n17-18 - 7, finished 7th\n18-19 - 1\n19-20 - 5\n20-21 - 1\n21-22 - 1\n22-23 - 3\n23-24 - 1\nLooks to me as if the recruitment, pre-season games and fitness is way off. You start poorly and it puts you hugely under pressure for a difficult season.\nThe money I get, but the fitness and game preparation looks dreadful.\n97 Posted 28/08/2024 at 20:18:54\nTthere are always far more posts following a defeat than following a victory.\n98 Posted 28/08/2024 at 20:41:53\nBeto is a threat and a danger. But he can't be left isolated.\nIt's the same as much as most Everton strikers of the last 30 years.\nUnless you have a player who is absolutely exceptional as a counter-attacking and line front man — such as Lukaku — the lone striker will never be prolific.\nAlternatively Calvert-Lewin has exceptional aerial ability and good hold-up play. Therefore you can develop an attack by punting long balls to him and getting him to hold it which he will do successfully quite a few times in a game.\nHis best period for goals was when he had attacking players such as James Rodriguez in and around him.\nIf we isolate Beto and just get him chasing lost causes then he will effectively be feeding off his own scraps and massively under pressure to finish the limited chances created by his team mates.\nHis finishing ability is not ruthless enough for him to play this role and score loads of goals. He and Calvert-Lewin together would be some threat because I think he would feed well off the space Calvert-Lewin would create by attracting defenders into a duel.\n99 Posted 28/08/2024 at 20:47:22\nCompare the speed and high numbers on the Spurs match thread (as the 3,000 were heading home and the keyboard-folk were tucking into dinner) with yesterday mate. It's like fecking night and day. And then for more fun, see if any of the biggest gobs in the hour or two after Spurs posted after yesterday's win.\nWe all know that top-flight footy is stuffed with structural inequities but, while hardly being the biggest things of all, this league cup draw is breathtakingly blatant.\n100 Posted 28/08/2024 at 20:51:18\nAs Mike Gaynes says, he gets fouls because he has presence, his first thought is to engage the defender, get in front, he needs game time, I'd say.\nBut we've got to get bodies around him, because it's going to bounce off him a lot of the time.\n101 Posted 28/08/2024 at 21:29:48\nAfter being one of the better players last Saturday, surely Dixon should have been the swap for Coleman, even though Dixon came on later.\nI think these who have been calling for Ndiaye and O'Brien saw the improvement with those two starting and Beto will always miss a few, fall over his feet, and frustrate fans, but he never gives up and normally pops up for a goal.\nI would continue with Beto, give him more game time and work on his techniques of lifting his head up and looking for players to lay the ball off to.\nAt least we resembled a team last night, regardless of opposition, but I have a feeling unless Tarkowski is not fit, both O'Brien and Ndiaye will be dropped with Doucoure coming back in. Pints on me after the game if Ashley Young does not get on the pitch at some point.\n102 Posted 28/08/2024 at 21:51:47\nBrian. Ashley Young will start. Just you watch.\n103 Posted 28/08/2024 at 23:42:01\nAs Christine points out, there are sometimes virtuoso players who can be considered exempt from their fair share of the defensive stuff, but then you need compensatory ultra-industrious workhorses taking up the slack.\nMy overall point was that the sort of money we pay (transfers and wages), astronomic though it seems, still isn't quite enough to net us any guaranteed true top level all-rounders, but with some luck we might occasionally snag the genuine article.\nYou appear convinced we haven't lucked out with Ndiaye and I was wondering what had convinced you.\nPaul Swan (76), you are referring to the sending off against Brighton, not the situation for the booking he got yesterday, which I believe the commentators ‘excuse' was for.\nColin Malone — “ You can only play to the manager's tactics.”\nBrian Clough — \"Once that whistle blows, all tactics go out the window.\"\nTime for a ToffeeWeb poll?\n104 Posted 29/08/2024 at 02:35:20\nGiven the choice between an attacker who can't defend, or a defender who can't attack, I believe Dyche will pick the latter every time. In every position.\nPlaying Ndiaye is very obvious to me. In a team of defenders and midfielders (including a striker who is effectively played as our first line of defence) we need someone to want the ball and give the opposition just something to think about.\n105 Posted 29/08/2024 at 10:50:31\nIt's a disgrace if it's given to McNeil and not Iroegbunam.\nI know what you mean. I thought it was obviously Tim Iroegbunam's goal — and if it had deflected in off a defender — then guess what? Yes, it would be Tim Iroegbunam's goal.\nBut that big guy Dwight McNeil (nb: not O'Neil) was the one in the line of the original strike and it was his foot that deflected the shot past the goalie and into the other side of the net that he was not covering.\nSo just another of those quirky things about football. It's one thing if a defender does it; quite another if an attacker does exactly the same thing. It would give you a sore head if you think about too much.\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
