With Rodri—last year’s winner—ruled out due to injury and Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo now outside the conversation, a new generation of elite talents is ready to claim the world’s highest individual footballing honour. David Bolarinwa, in this article, profiles ten of the most compelling contenders, breaking down their performances, accolades, and the narratives that could shape the outcome of this year’s award. From rising stars like Lamine Yamal to resurgent forces like Ousmane Dembélé, the race for the Ballon d’Or has never felt more open—or more symbolic of a changing era in world football.\n1. Ousmane Dembélé (Paris Saint-Germain)\nThe French winger leads the Ballon d’Or race after a sensational season with PSG, guiding the club to a historic treble – Ligue 1, Coupe de France, and their first-ever UEFA Champions League title. Dembélé scored around 35 goals and provided 15 assists across competitions, delivering big performances in crucial games, including the Champions League final. His pace, directness, and newfound consistency have elevated him into the global elite, making him a strong favourite to win the award.\n2. Lamine Yamal (Barcelona)\nThe teenage prodigy has taken the football world by storm, becoming the youngest serious contender in Ballon d’Or history. Yamal was central to Barcelona’s La Liga and Copa del Rey double, registering 18 goals and over 20 assists. His intelligence on the ball, dribbling, and decision-making have earned him comparisons to Lionel Messi. At just 18, his presence among the nominees represents both a generational shift and the early makings of a footballing icon.\n3. Raphinha (Barcelona)\nOnce seen as a squad player, Raphinha has emerged as one of Barcelona’s most vital assets. He finished the season with over 35 goals and 25 assists, making him the club’s top contributor in front of goal. His tireless work ethic, combined with an explosive end product, powered Barça through tight matches. In a year where consistency is heavily rewarded, Raphinha’s impact is impossible to overlook.\n4. Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)\nStill delivering at the highest level, Salah had another stellar campaign with Liverpool, helping the Reds win the Premier League. The Egyptian winger posted 30+ goals and nearly 20 assists, maintaining his status as one of the most productive forwards in Europe. Though Liverpool didn’t go deep in the Champions League, Salah’s individual brilliance, leadership, and consistency over the season have kept him firmly in the Ballon d’Or conversation.\n5. Scott McTominay (Napoli)\nA surprising yet deserved nominee, McTominay enjoyed a remarkable career resurgence after joining Napoli from Manchester United. The Scottish midfielder scored 12 goals and anchored Napoli’s midfield in their run to the Serie A title. His energy, box-to-box engine, and goal threat earned him the club’s Player of the Season award. He becomes the first Scot in decades to be shortlisted, and while not a favourite to win, his inclusion is a tribute to his transformation.\nRead Also: Deschamps back Dembele for Ballon d’Or\n6. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (Paris Saint-Germain)\nThe Georgian winger was instrumental in PSG’s treble-winning season. With flair, creativity, and consistent end product, Kvaratskhelia tallied over 25 goal contributions, complementing Dembélé on the opposite flank. His influence in European matches, particularly in the knockout stages, added weight to his nomination. If votes are split among PSG players, Kvaratskhelia could sneak higher up the list than expected.\n7. Désiré Doué (Paris Saint-Germain)\nA breakout star of the 2024/25 season, Doué added balance and dynamism to PSG’s midfield. His ability to transition quickly, link defence to attack, and contribute key goals in tight matches gave PSG a cutting edge throughout their successful campaign. Still just 20, Doué’s emergence as one of Europe’s top young midfielders has been rewarded with his first Ballon d’Or nomination.\n8. Pedri (Barcelona)\nOften the unsung hero in Barcelona’s midfield, Pedri’s intelligence and vision were key to the team’s domestic success. His pass completion, tactical awareness, and calmness under pressure allowed others around him—like Yamal and Raphinha—to shine. While his numbers weren’t eye-popping, his control and influence on the rhythm of Barça’s play earned him widespread praise from coaches and pundits alike.\n9. Kylian Mbappé (Real Madrid)\nMbappé’s first season at Real Madrid was productive—over 30 goals and multiple standout performances—but lacked the silverware to match. Without a league or Champions League title, Mbappé’s campaign has fallen short of his own high standards. Nevertheless, his individual output remains elite, and his presence in the top 10 is secured on quality alone. Still only 26, he remains a constant threat in the Ballon d’Or race.\n10. Harry Kane (Bayern Munich)\nHarry Kane continued his prolific form after moving to Germany, finishing with 44 goals and 12 assists for Bayern. Individually, it was one of his best seasons ever. However, Bayern’s failure to win the Bundesliga or make a deep Champions League run weakens his case. That said, Kane’s consistency and professionalism still earned him a nomination, and he remains one of the world’s most reliable strikers.",
