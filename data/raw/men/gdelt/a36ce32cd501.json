Celtic Park is where we come to support our football club,\" the statement said.\n\"Recognising this, respecting the gravity of the tragedy unfolding and its impact on communities in Scotland and across the world, and in line with other clubs, leagues and associations, we ask that banners, flags and symbols relating to the conflict and those countries involved in it are not displayed at Celtic Park at this time.\"\nTo many football supporters, their clubs are an extension of their beliefs.\nSome fans are happy to follow the football alone, but others want to be associated with an entity where their views on other matters can be shared in solidarity, in the stands, supporters' buses or in social clubs.\nIt has been this way since working men first aligned themselves with the colours of their local village, town, or city's football club. But the globalisation of football, along with the globalisation of the media, has made that concept ever more difficult and sometimes extremely delicate.\nCeltic Football Club have always prided themselves on being open to all, but as an organisation founded in the late 19th Century to help feed the poor, its core ethos has, understandably, been viewed as one aimed towards social justice and equality.\nSo how do fans, keen to share and promote those beliefs, express them in a world where politics and world events are so polarised and football authorities want nothing to do with any of it?\nThis is the backdrop to the ongoing dispute between the club and a section of their fans who are determined to show support for Palestinians. Celtic have already been fined on two separate occasions after some supporters displayed Palestinian flags during Champions League matches.\nThe club have recently distanced themselves from banners displayed by a section of support, following the attacks by Hamas in Israel and both Uefa and Fifa are adamant that politics and football should never mix. In a game where money is king, sponsors don't want the controversy.\nThose who want to use the club to convey their message are adamant they won't be silenced, though.\nAs ever, caught in the middle are those who want to leave the world behind for 90 minutes and concentrate solely on the football.\nMany Celtic fans have long had an affiliation with the Palestinian cause, with supporters displaying the territories' national flag on a number of occasions.\nIn 2014, European football's governing body Uefa fined the club after fans waved Palestinian flags during a match against Iceland's KR Reykjavik.\nPerhaps most controversially, the Green Brigade chose to display the flag once again during their team's 2016 Champions League qualifier against Israeli side, Hapoel Beer-Sheva - a move which landed the club a £8,600 fine.\nCeltic were also fined more than £15,350 by Uefa after fans displayed an offensive anti-monarchy banner during a Champions League match last year.\nUefa said the fine was for showing a \"provocative message of an offensive nature\".\nCeltic aren't the only Scottish football club to be punished for fan rule-breaking.\nIn 2022, Rangers were fined £4,400 by Uefa for actions by supporters during their Europa League group-stage ties.\nHearts were also fined for £10,500 for fans' offences after objects were thrown onto the pitch during their 2022 Europa Conference League match against Italian side Fiorentina.\nRelated topics\n- Published25 October 2023\n- Published20 October 2023\n- Published11 October 2022\n- Published19 November 2021",
