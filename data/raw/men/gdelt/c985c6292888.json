However, he has been dealing with lingering inflammation in his ankle, leading France manager Didier Deschamps and the Real Madrid medical staff to call him back to the team.\nMbappe now has 400 career goals, including 55 for France -- just two shy of Olivier Giroud's all-time national schoring record. He was scheduled to undergo scans on Friday, according to ESPN, and will miss France's game in Azerbaijan on Sunday.\nMeanwhile, Real Madrid's next match is against Elche on Nov. 23 before traveling to Athens to play against Olympiacos on Nov. 26 in a Champions League match.\nAlong with Mbappe, France released Eduardo Camavinga (hamstring) and Manu Kone (suspension) ahead of the team's final World Cup qualifier.\n--Field Level Media",
