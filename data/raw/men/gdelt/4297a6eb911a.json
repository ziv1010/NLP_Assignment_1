Email tips@dailymail.com\nHe made peace with his brother Liam last summer as the iconic duo announced a blockbuster comeback tour after 15 years of feuding.\nBut it seems Noel Gallagher has been saving his wrath for a fellow giant of the music industry as he slammed rapper Kendrick Lamar for his controversial Super Bowl half-time show.\nThe American musician, 37, took to the stage at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans on Sunday night for an action-packed performance, which saw him fire verbal shots at hip-hop rival Drake, 38.\nThe extravaganza, which came just a week after he scooped five Grammys in Los Angeles, involved a dance routine on top of a car and a run-through of some of his greatest hits including the No1 diss track Not Like Us.\nBut Oasis star Noel, 57, took a dim view of the whole thing, picking apart Kendrick's show in an interview with talkSPORT on Tuesday, which also saw him express fears over US involvement in football.\nHe said: 'I had to switch it off. It was absolute nonsense.\nNoel Gallagher has slammed rapper Kendrick Lamar for his controversial Super Bowl half-time show\nThe Oasis star took a dim view of the whole thing, picking apart Kendrick's performance in an interview with talkSPORT which also saw him express fears over US involvement in football\n'I didn't watch it all, I switched it off. There was like 300 people getting out of a car in the first two minutes.\n'But no I don't like the half-time nonsense and all that. It's usually artists I don't like but I do like watching the Super Bowl and I've got invested in the season this season - it was a good season I think.\n'I never watch the half-time show, I'm not interested in it.\n'No [I would not like to see it in the Champions League final] and it's coming, trust me. Americans are taking over our sport, they're taking over the Premier League, they're taking over the Champions League and 20 years from now it'll be nonsense.'\nIt is not the first time Noel has criticised a hip-hop star taking the centre-stage at a major event, after he famously branded Jay-Z's invitation to headline Glastonbury 'wrong'.\nHe told the BBC in 2008: 'Glastonbury has a tradition of guitar music.'\nJay-Z hit back by showing a clip of the Oasis songwriter's harsh words before his set before launching into a rendition of their most popular hit Wonderwall.\nIt was Kendrick who stole the headlines at this year's Super Bowl halfway through Philadelphia Eagles' comfortable dismantling of Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL's flagship game.\nThe American musician took to the stage at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans on Sunday night for an action-packed performance, which saw him fire verbal shots at hip-hop rival Drake\nDespite Drake suing his and Kendrick's record label over the controversial diss song, Not Like Us, which calls Drake a 'certified paedophile', he performed the song but omitted the word\nThe rapper had a surprise introduction from actor Samuel L.

Jackson, 76, who was dressed up as 'Uncle Sam', and performed a medley of his hits, before he was joined by R&B singer SZA, 35.\nKendrick did go on to deliver two other controversial lines, including 'Say Drake, I hear you like them young' and 'trying to strike a chord and it's probably a minor,' as the crowd sang along.\nHe also wore a big silver chain pendant with a small letter 'a', in another reference to 'A minor' in the lyrics and jeans by Celine.\nThe scathing diss track about Drake — who is currently out of the country on tour in Australia — won Lamar a Grammy for Record of the Year and Song of the Year last weekend.\nReleased last May, the viral song saw Kendrick sensationally accuse Drake of being a 'certified pedophile' and pursuing minors. Drake denied the allegations in his rebuttal track The Heart Part 6, saying his was 'not a name you gon’ see on no sex offender list'.\nTennis champion Serena Williams, who was once linked to Drake, was pictured dancing during Kendrick's performance of Not Like Us.\nThe star delivered two controversial lines about Drake (pictured), including 'Say Drake, I hear you like them young' and 'trying to strike a chord and it's probably a minor'\nIt is not the first time Noel has criticised a hip-hop star taking the centre-stage at a major event, after he famously branded Jay-Z's invitation to headline Glastonbury 'wrong'\nOasis's upcoming shows will be the first time they will perform on stage together since breaking up in 2009 following a backstage brawl at the Rock en Seine festival in France\nAt one point during the charged performance a man with a Palestinian flag tried to storm the half-time show but was intercepted by security.\nFans inside the stadium saw the drama unfold but TV cameras didn't show it to viewers.\nKendrick rocked a blue and white jacket, a black shirt, blue jeans and a backwards hat.\nHe was joined by a crew of backup dancers who formed an American flag while dressed in red, white and blue.\nAt one point during the performance Jackson returned, and told the crowd: 'Too loud, too reckless, too ghetto. Mr. Lamar, do you really know how to play the game?'\nKendrick performed wacced out murals, Bodies, Squabble, Euphoria, Humble, DNA, man at the garden, and Peekaboo by himself, before he was joined by SZA.\nThe duo performed their collabs Luther and All the Stars.
