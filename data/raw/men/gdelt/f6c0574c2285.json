The launch of a new online platform for football schools and coaches is also in the pipeline, which will allow the association to better organise all education and training programmes across the nation.\n- Drive participation – Working with the UEFA Grow team, the UAF is increasing the number of players in Ukraine, reorganising league structures and promoting the involvement of women.\n- Esports – With an eye on the future, and necessitated by the pandemic, the UAF has invested in efootball, organising national competitions, and competing at UEFA eEURO 2021.\n- Assistance for the regions – Despite the effects of the pandemic, and thanks in part to UEFA HatTrick funding, the UAF was able to ensure regional associations received ongoing support, meaning football could return quickly once restrictions were lifted.\n- Fair football – The UAF continues to challenge match-fixing, detecting 20 suspicious games in 2020, down from 41 in 2019.\nUEFA support\nUEFA’s HatTrick programme, which channels EURO funds into football development across Europe, has helped the UAF improve its footballing infrastructure across the country.\nBy focusing on building a series of full-size and mini artificial pitches, the association has been able to ensure more communities throughout Ukraine have access to high-quality, year-round facilities, crucial to a country where harsh weather conditions often make natural outdoor surfaces unplayable during the winter. Since 2015, the UAF has been able to build more than 2.5 times the number that had previously been constructed since 1991.\nIn turn, this means more children and grassroots players can enjoy the game more regularly, increasing the number of registered players and raising the level of the game.\nUEFA Foundation for Children in Ukraine\nSet up in 2015, the UEFA Foundation uses football as a vehicle to help improve children’s lives by supporting hundreds of campaigns and projects across Europe and around the world.\nCup of Trust\nCreated in 2019, the Cup of Trust is a crime prevention programme that brings together police officers, physical education teachers and young teenagers, aiming to foster friendly and trusting relationships between children and law enforcement officials.\nWith additional backing from UNICEF Ukraine, the initiative will continue throughout 2021 and 2022, creating 100 mixed teams of children, led by police officers, to take part in regional competitions with the aim of reaching the national finals.\nAs well as promoting respect, teamwork and healthy lifestyles, the Cup of Trust helps teach officials and educators how to use sport as a safeguarding tool, creating a safe environment for sport within the community.\nTimeline\nAssociation history\nNational team competitions\nPresident\nAndrii Shevchenko\nNationality: Ukrainian\nDate of Birth: 29 September 1976\nAssociation president since: 2024\nGeneral secretary\nIgor Gryshchenko\nNationality: Ukrainian\nDate of Birth: 5 February 1991\nGeneral secretary since: 2024",
