Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nModric respected Kovacic’s decision to leave Real Madrid in the pursuit of more regular football but admits it was ‘hard’ to lose a ‘special’ and close teammate.\nSpeaking on the (Ne)uspjeh prvaka YouTube channel, Modric said: ‘Mateo wanted to play. He wanted to play, even though, in my opinion, he played a lot.\n‘In that period at Real, he was, in my view, one of the best players, although he may disagree. Even if he wasn’t the main protagonist the whole time, he played outstanding matches and was very important.\n‘He wanted to be the protagonist, to be on the pitch constantly, the way Toni, Casemiro and I were, but he still played phenomenal football.\n‘It was hard for me when he left because Mateo is someone truly special to me.\n‘From the very beginning, from the moment he came to the national team, we created an exceptional relationship, a chemistry that lasts to this day, even after he left Real.\nMore Trending\n‘At Real, we became even closer, but often when someone leaves, paths naturally separate. With him, it became even stronger. Even stronger, actually.\n‘So it’s not just a friendship, but also a bond through family ties, and because of that, you miss all those players who left at certain moments.’\nModric ended his long association with Real Madrid over the summer, signing a one-year contract with Italian giants AC Milan.\nThe 40-year-old has made 18 appearances for Milan, who are second in La Liga – one point behind city rivals Inter – and 13th in the Champions League table.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Rio Ferdinand says Benjamin Sesko reminds him of ‘joke’ ex-Man Utd player\nMORE: Peter Schmeichel predicts where Manchester United will finish this season\nMORE: Ruben Amorim tells Man Utd star he has ‘no chance’ of playing against Wolves",
