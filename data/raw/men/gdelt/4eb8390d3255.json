  "body_text": "Everton 1 - 0 Arsenal\nA massive day for Everton and new manager Sean Dyche as Goodison Park witnesses a tremendous win over Premier League leaders Arsenal under former star, Mikel Arteta.\nBut for the Blues, it's very much the same old players who had become so bereft of everything that was needed to even come close to winning games in the Premier League, with no fresh blood for the new manager to use as a catalyst.\nMichael Keane and Nathan Patterson have been ruled out through injury while both James Garner and Andros Townsend are still some way from making full recoveries from their longer-term issues.\nDyche goes with just one striker in Dominic Calvert-Lewin, while Demarai Gray and Neal Maupay are left on the bench, and Abdoulaye Doucouré returns to the side after being disciplined following a fall-out with Lampard that saw him excluded for the defeat at West Ham Utd last time out.\nSean Dyche received a massive reception from the packed Goodison crowd after the teams had walked out and before Arsenal got the game underway.\nMykoleko got stuck in on Odegaard for the first foul. Everton took possession and were immediately looking to play forward balls to Calvert-Lewin, while Coleman kept great pace to marshall Martinelli.\nArsenal looked for slow and steady buildup play to break down the Blues but Mykolenko and Coleman had other ideas and Calvert-Lewin tried to advance with the ball, but Onana took a head knock.\nEverton put in a good break and McNeil had a chance to shoot with Calvert-Lewin following in but he was flagged offside the ball wouldn't run to him and Arsenal were quickly on the counter, but that roused the crowd and the Blues quickly reformed the defence with really good shape, Partey could only shoot at Pickford from distance.\nNo farting about at the back when Pickford cleared the ball, he tried to find Calvert-Lewin straightaway. Doucouré tried to cross in for Calvert-Lewin but it was blocked. Gueye handed off Saka with a poke in the eye that needed attention.\nFrom a Blues throw-in , some really good break-out play and Iwobi swung in a decent cross that won the first corner, superb from McNeil to the far post, Onana denied but a second corner, Iwobi from the left, Tarkowski again at the far post forcing a third. And again an excellent far-post delivery, Three of the best Everton corner seen all season!\nMcNeil forced a fourth corner, switched to the near post and met well enough by Calvert-Lewin but absolutely no finesse or direction off his top-knot, well over the bar. Everton repelled another attack and Calvert-Lewin had his first shot from a narrow angle that was gathered by Ramsdale.\nEverton had their best spell of pressure but there was still not enough guile in the final ball. Some excellent work by Calvert-Lewin on the breakout, winning the ball, holding the ball, and getting the throw-in. The defensive discipline and work ethic had been excellent in the first half-hour but Saka finally beat Mykolenko in a right old tussle and Nketiah snuck in but whacked it well wide.\nDoucoure did well to win the ball in midfield but was slow to make use of it until he was fouled. McNeil swung the ball in well but Ramsdale tracked it all the way.\nA superb interception by Onana created a fantastic opening for Calvert-Lewin who didn't get anywhere enough and could not turn it in from 1 yard!!! Then McNeil played a beautiful cross onto Doucoure's head unmarked but, with the goal gaping, his contact was all wrong – and he knew it.\nThe Blue shirts were chasing every ball now, doing a great intimidation job on the Gunners who were increasingly tentative in trying to protect their possession of the ball. But a deep cross found Saka free and his shot, deflecting off Mykolenko's shin, was bound for the left corner but for Coady getting back to clear brilliantly off the line.\nGueye tackled Martinelli aggressively and foolishly grappled his face again, giving up a needless free-kick that Xhaka headed over. Calvert-Lewin again did very well to hold up the ball and win a throw-in. Arsenal pressed again for a first-half goal as 3 minutes were added on.\nA horrible ball back to Pickford gave Nketiah a half chance to block his clearance. At the other end, a brilliant McNeil cross picked out Calvert-Lewin and his header should really have found the net but it went agonizingly wide.\nAn excellent first half of football under Sean Dyche who had, as expected, completely transformed these players: xG Score should be Everton 3 - 1 Arsenal.\nMore good work by Calvert-Lewin after the break set up Gueye for a deflected shot that Ramsdale did well to react to, but the offside flag was up. McNeil was lucky, playing backwards in defence under pressure, and playing it out – should have been a corner to Arsenal – not given!\nOnana fed Gueye well but he should not have been the player breaking through, and Everton had to defend again, Onana getting fouled.\nCalvert-Lewin did very well again with his hold-up play but pushed the ball out too far for Iwobi whose cross was poor. At the other end, more good defending from Mykolenko but an Arsenal corner,and two shots well blocked. Arsenal were playing with a lot more intent but Everton eventually got the goal-kick.\nEverton tried to build again but Mykolenko's attempted volley from distance was terrible. Tarkowski cleared straight to Zinchenko but Onana was in well to intercept. However, Arsenal continued to press Nkeiah setting up Odegaard who screamed one yards over.\nEverton worked it forward and Iwobi won a corner, swung over superbly by McNeil to the far post and power-headed in by James Tarkowski!!! Great goal — Made in Burnley!!!\nA poor pass was intercepted and it forced Mykolenko to trip Saka, the ensuing attack winning an Arsenal corner taht was taken by Trossard, but he could not beat the first Everton defender.\nArsenal looked to get free in the Everton area but were swarmed upon by Blue shirts, Maupay baulking Gabriel into Gana. Odegaard got a run in on goal, superbly tackled by Coady.\nIt was now more competitive than ever in the midfield, the jeopardy of one mistake, Onana going in with his very long legs all around Ben White for a yellow card. Maupay and Xhaka got into a bit of a spat over something.\nArsenal won a corner that Onana was very happy to head clear, as the Gunners looked to crank the screw on the so-far solid Everton defence. But out-balls to Maupay were nowhere near as effective as they had been with Calvert-Lewin in that role – why not Simms?\nArsenal got bolder and went for a far post cross but Pickford snapped it out of the air. Still, it was nerve-wracking every time they came forward. Maupay was fouled (not given) but McNeil won a corner and almost got a good ding-dong melee going inside the Arsenal goal area but the ball was cleared.\nArsenal attacked, Trossard shooting at Pickford, deflected off Iwobi and well stopped by the Sunderland man. But Arsenal created another chance when the ball fell to Saka, McNeil in quickly to mess up his shot.\nInto the final 10 minutes and Trossard fired high and wide after Saka had fouled McNeil (not given). McNeil won another Everton corner after a fine Tarkowski steal; the Blues lost out on the ensuing scrap after being called for a foul.\nInto the last 5 minutes and a very nervy Goodison Park absolutely desperate to hold on for what would be a famous win – but not through Pickford's silly time-wasting.\nAnother Arsenal attack, another fantastic Gana interception to steal the ball in the Everton penalty area. Arsenal probed again, but Gueye was across to block it out for another corner, smashed clear by Coleman. Zinchenko trying to shoot from a long way out, and missing, as 6 minutes of added time were signalled.\nA tremendous run by Onana down the wing set the tone for those final minutes. But another Arsenal corner was given away, a set-up for Zinchenko wellied nice and high over Pickford's goal.\nSome fine battling saw the ball won and lost until Everton won a free-kick that Pickford again took plenty of time over. Then there were two balls on the pitch as Zinchenko and Maupay sparked an excellent session of handbags all round. Zinchenko should really have been given a red for his reaction, jumping on Maupay and shoving him down.\nEverton continued to play out the final seconds and celebrate an excellent first win for new manager Sean Dyche with the Premier League leaders soundly beaten.\nEverton: Pickford [Y:86'], Coleman, Coady, Tarkowski, Mykolenko [Y:63'], McNeil, Doucoure, Gana, Onana [Y:69'], Iwobi, Calvert-Lewin (61' Maupay [Y:90+5']).\nSubs not Used: Begovic, Holgate, Gray, Mina, Godfrey, Davies, Vinagre, Simms.\nArsenal: Ramsdale, White (85' Tomiyasu), Saliba, Gabriel, Zinchenko [Y:90+5'], Martinelli (59' Jorginho), Partey (59' Trossard), Xhaka, Saka, Odegaard (77' Vieira), Nketiah.\nSubs not Used: Turner, Tierney, Holding, Kiwior, Cozier-Duberry.\nReader Comments (360)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Christ on a bike, Sean, get a grip!\n10 Posted 04/02/2023 at 11:53:41\nWe know about all these players and what they can do or can't do but as a team they have been underachieving in most games this season even against other poor teams.\nWhilst I don't expect an overnight remedy from the new gaffer, it would be nice to see some improvement soon.\nOn a negative note it does seem that Calvert-Lewin will plough a loan furrow which is too much for this lad with his limitations.\n11 Posted 04/02/2023 at 11:56:27\nClearly Ellis Simms and Neal Maupay aren't the best runners or trainers.\n12 Posted 04/02/2023 at 11:57:57\n13 Posted 04/02/2023 at 11:58:08\nCan't agree with the thoughts expressed that they should somehow reign it in until the end of the season. It's fresh and it's raw and it's genuine.\n14 Posted 04/02/2023 at 11:58:20\nDominic will have auxiliary strikers coming up to support him. You might be screaming your head off with a goal or two for the Blues and possibly a point or three.\nAnd when you scream, do it with a Scouse accent, you know the score!!\n15 Posted 04/02/2023 at 12:02:32\n16 Posted 04/02/2023 at 12:04:47\n17 Posted 04/02/2023 at 12:09:22\n18 Posted 04/02/2023 at 12:26:13\n19 Posted 04/02/2023 at 12:30:19\nOnana has the physical attributes to play Fellaini type role off Calvert-Lewin. Doucoure has the engine to run in behind. Let's wait and see how it plays out.\n20 Posted 04/02/2023 at 12:45:13\nOurs don't get out of our own penalty area.\n21 Posted 04/02/2023 at 13:05:57\nWe're doing well.\n22 Posted 04/02/2023 at 13:22:18\n23 Posted 04/02/2023 at 13:23:03\nStill boggles the mind how incompetent he proved to be as a manager.\n24 Posted 04/02/2023 at 13:27:09\nWe looked a lot more organized, players seem to know what was expected of them, and the only winger on the park didn't make it look obvious that that was what he was. And amid all of this Onana looked superior to all on the park.\nA lot still to be done and Calvert-Lewin needs to stay central when we attack but Arsenal look set up for something we are not doing and if this is down to Mr Dyche then more power to his elbow.\n25 Posted 04/02/2023 at 13:32:29\nCalvert-Lewin looks much better though several cretins on the Live Forum slagging him off.\nI think and hope he will get back to his best under Dyche.\n26 Posted 04/02/2023 at 13:34:07\n27 Posted 04/02/2023 at 13:57:05\nI would love to see Maupay score today, more than any other player.\n28 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:21:28\n29 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:26:51\nEntire midfield were fantastic, McNeil and Doucoure look like different players. Defence tight and compact, with special mention to the wide players, especially Seamus.\nMaupay cannot be played up top by himself, but if it's for the greater good of the team, fine by me.\nNot often you can have a smile on your face after an Everton game these past two seasons, but this is one of them.\nThey are top, we were bottom. Key word: 'were'.\nHow good!\n30 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:27:46\nThank you, Sean, for this. Thank the Lord. The Holy Trinity are smiling down on you! UTFT's\n31 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:29:37\n32 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:30:28\n33 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:33:06\nThe nerve of those fucks that sneered at us. UTGDMFT!!!!!\n34 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:33:08\nWe still want you out, Bill. Don't forget that, will you — wherever you are!!!\n35 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:33:52\nForza Everton\n36 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:34:01\nOrganised, disciplined and hard working â€“ they actually looked like they'd been coached.\n5 more wins.\n37 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:34:20\nSean Dyche — take a bow.\nBring on the derby!!\n38 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:34:25\nYes, we're still lacking in plenty of areas and looked completely pointless once Dom went off but for now, it's three very valuable points.\nEnjoy your weekend for the first time in a while, fellow blues.\n39 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:35:10\nAlso who was that new lad McNeil. Haven't see him before.\n40 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:35:13\n41 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:35:32\nGrit, determination, flight, passion. Everything that has been missing for sometime aside from the Palace game.\nOnwards and upwards.\n42 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:36:25\nIf anything, Simms should have come on, a big bloke they would have been wary of as they would have known little about him.\nWe played well but nearly let them off the hook. Why did we play well? To me, organization, nothing complicated just do what you are there for and play for each other. Oh, and the one corner that counted delivered properly.\nAnd MotM, by a country mile, Onana,\n43 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:36:51\n44 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:37:03\n45 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:37:04\nGreat support from the fans in the ground. Thank you! Thank You! Thank You! From Adelaide, Australia!\n46 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:39:01\n47 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:39:11\n48 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:40:57\n49 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:41:01\n50 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:41:11\n51 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:42:12\nNo needless backwards passing\nFirst-time crosses rather than messing about with it.\nMost of all â€“ plenty of players in the box when the crosses arrived.\nSpecial word for all you fans inside Goodison today, you were fantastic.\nSean Dyche â€“ take a bow.\n52 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:42:28\nI reckon Simms would have been a better decision but - eh - we won! What a fucking great result!\n53 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:43:00\nYes great result, but importantly a great performance too.\nEveryone played their parts, but apart from being a very annoying little man, I can't see what Maupay brings to the team.\nOnana â€“ Man of the Match and great work also from McNeil and Iwobi to get up and down the wings and also help out the fullbacks.\nWell done to everyone. Now just keep it up, lads.\nCOYB\n54 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:47:48\n55 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:49:51\nPut 㿞 on us to win and cashed out for 𧶀... should have let it run.\nWell done to all concerned, especially McNeil.\n56 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:50:36\nFantastic result and performance from the team. COYB\n57 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:51:07\nBut that was only part of the story. We didn't try to play through Arsenal. Pickford launched his kicks upfield. We got the ball out wide and tried to get early crosses into the box. We kept it simple and direct without playing hoofball.\nI'm shocked at how much Dyche managed to change our attitude and style of play within a week.\nThere is a long and bumpy road ahead. Today is only the start. But there is a route out of this relegation mess.\n58 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:51:32\n59 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:51:39\n60 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:53:06\nLampard should never have been appointed in the first place. Nice chap, utterly clueless manager.\nGreat result and much needed. Did exactly what was needed; kept it simple, compact and worked bloody hard all over the pitch.\nExcellent start for Dyche, can now kick on and get away from the truly shite teams around us.\n61 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:53:40\nI suppose what Sean Dyche got right was utilising Gueye, Onana and DoucourÃ© and telling Iwobi and McNeil to stay wide and work hard helping out their full-backs.\nI thought that made Iwobi more peripheral than he was under Frank Lampard and his performance was â€˜bitty' as a consequence as he seems to be more vulnerable to unforced errors when facing towards his own defence.\nStill, let's focus on the positives and enjoy the result. Maybe Sean Dyche simply has the ability to pump up the players in the right way? Maybe it's just the â€˜ginger' magic at work?\n62 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:53:42\n63 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:55:16\n64 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:56:55\nLet's not hang Frank Lampard out to dry. It's the board that need to be continually reminded of the venomous feelings towards them.\nSharp looked pensive and worried sitting on his lonesome.\n65 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:58:01\nAlmost unbelievable, the change in attitude, purpose, game plan, passing, working both for each other but, more importantly, as a Unit!\n66 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:58:02\n67 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:59:18\nTo all at Toffeweb Towers\nBrought the sun and the flowers\nWhere there used to be rainâ€¦\nAnd there was me intent on prolonging Dry January into February...\nUTFT!\n68 Posted 04/02/2023 at 14:59:28\n69 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:00:44\n70 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:00:48\nNever know, might make it back to the Lockleys one day. Let me know if you make Perth.\n71 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:01:33\nFrank seemed to think he could ask them to play like Beckenbauer and Baresi which was never going to happen.\n72 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:01:46\nSo pleased to see the board stayed away â€“ not for them the exhilaration of a good win, they don't deserve it.\nDare we hope for the same next week? You bet your life! COYB!\n73 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:01:55\nThe sun will come up brighter this morning.\n74 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:02:59\nIt looked to me (and others may disagree) that, although it was a defensive formation, they still made enough chances for one or two more goals. It is 3 points and now the battle starts.\nIt is a different style of management than Lampard but it is a style that is more suitable with the players he has, plus the timing of his subs was correct, even if the personnel could have been better.\nThe most amazing thing to me was for once my weekend is not ruined right from the early kickoff.\n75 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:04:26\n76 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:06:20\nHow wonderful to have a proper manager in charge and the players responding\nDwight McNeil: a player reborn.\nDoucoure: give him a contract extension.\nOnana: our new figure head â€“ superb.\nGueye: still got it in a system that suits him.\nIwobi: decent.\nCalvert-Lewin: did well enough but clearly still not fit (I can't believe people question his commitment when he's clearly playing when less than 100%)\nDefence excellent: Coleman absolutely brilliant and Mykolenko, marking the most in-form player in the Premier League, did great\nGotta say we were great. Come on, you blues!!\n77 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:07:25\nAny relation to Chris?\n78 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:07:51\n79 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:08:18\nWe haven't had a decent Saturday in ages, the first in a long time! Dyche will give us a chance, I reckoned we needed at least seven wins to give us a chance, that's one down.\nThere can be no slacking, now let's hope we get a few favours today.\n80 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:08:57\nThe Board should stay away from all matches. Really got egg on their face today, need to go.\nAt last we have the right manager, next we need the right Board.\n81 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:16:11\nDid you forget about Seamus!\nStill buzzing, what a result, deservedly beat the Premier League leaders. The pressing game was brilliant, Arsenal couldn't deal with it.\nThey are supposed to have a great midfield, completely outshone by Doucoure, Onana (MotM) and Gueye.\nMcNeill looks a great signing now. Can't wait to watch again on Match of the Day. Dyche deserves all the credit, and to see him so animated on the line, a breath of fresh air.\n82 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:16:55\n83 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:17:14\nObviously I'm not falling for it; no way does a new manager come in and immediately nail the Champions elect, Arsenal, it just doesn't happen.\nSeriously, are we playing tonight or something?\n84 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:18:52\n85 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:21:02\nAnd Cristy, Coleman had Martinelli in his pocket at game.\n86 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:21:40\nI didn't forget Seamus but didn't mention him as he has been a bit more all rounded throughout his career whereas the other 3 are very much just defenders so they more than he struggled with playing it out from the back.\n87 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:24:23\nIf you want your players to perform, have a fucking plan!\n88 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:29:14\nSi, we were playing the Premier League leaders and have been shite for months; we were never going to be expansive but we still created several great chances and could easily have won by more.\nI always hope the RS lose and today is no different â€“ I think we will be okay regardless so I hope Wolves spank them and we do too. Could be instant cult status for Dyche if we beat them!\n89 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:29:59\n90 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:30:30\nWhat difference it has made having a manager who can organise and get the team playing to its strengths. There was no weakest link today, long may it continue.\nSuch a good team effort but Onana stood out as the best on the pitch today. What a player we have got.\nOne of the best things today was to see Dyche lambast the players after 20 minutes. Telling the midfield in no uncertain terms “LINE OF FIVE, LINE OF FIVE!â€ â€“ Imploring them to keep the shape and discipline.\nThat's like having an extra man on the pitch keeping the players focussed. Job done well today and an impressive start. In a week, Sean Dyche has brought back some optimism for the future.\n91 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:35:49\nOh, I forgotâ€¦ we WON.\n92 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:37:49\nEveryone played well today to restore a bit of pride and belief. Well done.\n93 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:38:00\nCurbishley did it 16 years ago at West Ham, beating Man Utd.\n94 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:38:20\nChecked the table and then checked the results. Why am I happy Liverpool are 2-0 down? We could really turn the tide at Anfield next week. Football is a funny old game for sure.\n95 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:38:41\nOnly negative I think was the subbing of Calvert-Lewin for Maupay, I am hoping it was either tactical or being careful with him and he isn't injured. Maupay looked very lightweight and ineffective in comparison.\n96 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:38:53\nHappy for Wolves to win, and at the end of the season see if we can be higher than Liverpool in the Premier League.\nI wasn't keen on Dyche but, with better players for him to work with, I'm sure the football can be a bit more inventive around the box. I don't think there's anymore relegation fears when you look at the quality of the first team.\nAt the end of the day, if we sacrafice pretty football but keep ourselves on the right side of goal difference every match â€“ who cares. In fact, a lot of similarities to Carlo's team on keeping it tight and well drilled and not pretty football in every game â€“ so very pleased.\nA Doucoure all-rounder type suits Dyche, so we might need a younger version soon, but that's a long way off. Iwobi, is not a proper wide player but a great engine and loads of skill so, if Dyche can find a way to make Iwobi find a cross out wide, then this drilled Dyche team can be a very good team that no-one fancies playing against.\nOnana â€“ if that Brighton lad is worth 㿲 million and the new Chelsea boy is 𧴜+ million, then we've got one hell of a player here, as he's up there with the best in the Premier League.\n97 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:38:55\nThe mind bogglesâ€¦\n98 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:39:32\nI can enjoy the weekend for a change.\n99 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:42:24\nI believe Dyche said Calvert-Lewin came off as a precaution with a tight hamstring.\n100 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:42:41\nStill, like everyone, I imagine, this has lifted us all and more importantly the players and the team. Atmosphere sounded great there today, and I agree if we go into the derby match with the same attitude, I think we can get something.\n101 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:44:09\n102 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:44:36\nIt's not necessarily slating Maupay but more recognizing that the Arsenal back four came more into the game when Calvert-Lewin went off; they had nobody to worry about. How many long balls did Maupay challenge for, never mind win?\n103 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:46:51\nJust kept it simple. Excellent display and well-deserved victory. Impressive start for a very animated manager. Well done, Sean.\n104 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:48:53\n105 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:49:41\nThank you, I was just about to say the same thing. It wasn't slating him but, in comparison to Calvert-Lewin, we lost our threat and allowed Arsenal to take off a back four player and put on an attackerâ€¦ We lost our impetus.\n106 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:52:57\nI wonder how Frank felt watching it, maybe he thought, “Why didn't I think of that?â€\n107 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:53:07\n108 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:55:23\nBig question is how long these players can sustain this. With this manager, I'd say likely, though there'll be many ups and downs for the next 3 months.\nHoofball, anyone?\n109 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:55:54\n110 Posted 04/02/2023 at 15:56:09\nThat's footballâ€¦ lots of hypothetical stuff fill with hindsight. Many wanted it to work but many thought it wouldn't. Now, we will never know, but the indications are the latter.\n111 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:00:07\nI saw that lol much different than the ramblings of Koeman or Martinez.\nAlso, quote of the week must be Onana: “I ain't leaving the ship.â€ Young fellow from Belgium has been here all of 5 minutes but is dedicated enough and professional enough to publicly honour his commitment to the club and rebuff the easy option of jumping ship.\n112 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:05:08\n113 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:09:51\n114 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:11:54\nI loved the whole approach to the game. Get the ball forward early and men forward too. The most obvious improvement, because of this, is that we created way more chances. We got crosses in early and got men in the box. It was not the stagnant football we have witnessed all season.\nOnana was immense but I was also really pleased for McNeil and Doucoure who also shone. The whole team perfomed well and what's more, they looked like they enjoyed it too.\nThank you, Sean! I know that we need to temper expectations but I believe that we can survive the drop this season.\n115 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:14:04\nThat's my point. “Our Anthonyâ€ the local lad is off at the first opportunity, Onana could've done the same and given his brief tenure at the club â€“ who could have blamed him?\nBut he refused and showed greater loyalty than “one of our ownâ€.\n116 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:15:10\n117 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:17:06\nAnd money talks, especially with us these days!\nI take all the badge slapping with a pinch of salt these days,; no doubt he is committed to the cause right now â€“ as all the players should be.\n118 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:23:02\nThe crowd sounded amazing on the TV. Now to beat some of the teams around us.\n119 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:23:22\nFucking fantastic. I was thrilled when Dyche was appointed. He is such a perfect fit for Everton. I'm over the moon at the effort and result.\nParticularly loved Maupay and his little rat tactics. We need more of that snide shit out there. Anything to win, anything. Keep it up you beautiful little shit Maupay.\nWe will NOT get relegated. I think Sean Dyche is Davey Moyes Mk 2. He's going to be at Everton a long, long time, and the style of play will be better than it was under the ginger one.\nGreat game! Absolutely fantastic.\n120 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:25:16\n121 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:29:26\nI don't think Simms would've provided the same kind of performance, although our long balls would've suited Simms rather than Maupay.\n122 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:30:10\nOn a separate note â€“ not all is well with the RS by the way â€“ Klopp has lost the plot with his focus on Chelsea and their spending â€“ we've got nothing to fear next week if we can believe!\n123 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:30:28\nFrank just looked out of his depth â€“ no structure, no plan, and just seemed to wing it every week. He should have done better with this squad.\nEarly doors but what a start, just wish Dyche could have faced Wolves, Brighton and Southampton.\n124 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:32:48\nThat's if we have the same owner when the summer window opens.\nI have high hopes that we won't, that the Yanks Najafi and Moorad will leverage Moshiri's chaos and buy him out.\nAnd trust me, those two guys will NEVER let a young player like Onana get away.\n125 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:33:43\n126 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:34:04\nOnana particularly impressive as was Seamus using all his experience in keeping Martinelli quiet. I'd have been happy with 2 points from Arsenal and Liverpoolâ€¦ now thinking 6 points could be possible.\n127 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:34:28\n'One swallow doesn't make a summer' as Linda Lovelace famously didn't say.\n128 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:35:12\nOnly negative (very minor) was I thought we lost a lot when Maupay came on.\nDyche is a genius if he can get a song out of McNeil â€“ did well.\nCoyb Ftrs\n129 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:37:33\nMcNeil seemed to have put on a yard of pace.\nOnana is going to be a great, I hope it's with us.\nSeamus Coleman — what more can you say about the fella?\nFucking top day.\n130 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:38:04\n131 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:40:10\n132 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:42:25\n133 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:42:43\nI sit in the Family Enclosure, probably about 10 seats from the home dugout. The difference between Sean Dyche and Lampard in management style is incredible. Dyche and a Steve Stone constantly out barking orders at the players.\nEvery time there was a dodgy decision, he was in the 4th official's face. At one point ,the 4th official even agreed with him.\nThe telling point early on. He shouts tells them to stop the short goal kick, tells them \"Go to press there!\" They did and then Arsenal for ages hoofed every goal kick.\nHe kept telling them to press in pairs and was organising them.\nLampard nearly every game just stood there, arms folded and quiet.\nGoing the game has been a chore of late, going out of duty. Today, it was like we got our Everton team back!!!\n134 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:44:55\nThe point I'm trying to make is it's smaller margins between being â€˜shite for months' and beating the league leaders than some people realise, and whatever tweaks a manager makes to get positives from certain players can also be to the â€˜detriment' of other players input.\nThe key is for the manager to make the correct adjustments so the team performance overall gets better. Will people get back on Iwobi's case if his involvement is reduced significantly?\nPersonally I haven't seen â€˜shite for months', but I've seen far too easily â€˜knocked out of our stride' and far too few full 90 minutes from all parts of the team. Likewise, I didn't see â€˜brilliant' today, but I did see plenty of commitment and fight.\nIt was still a very close run thing, however, and the manager needs to get us converting more chances or that simple inability will prevent us from surviving. Clean sheets alone won't cut it.\nI like commitment and fight, I like Sean Dyche's attitude. All that matters for the rest of the season is results and I will enjoy the positive ones as much as anyone.\n135 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:45:55\nBolt Football Holdings, their partnership with David Blitzer of Crystal Palace, has recently bought into four European clubs, most notably Augsburg in the Bundesliga. I can't imagine them showing up at Goodison unless they were already in the box and teeing up a shot.\nI interviewed Moorad a couple times back in the 1980s when he was a blossoming sports agent and I was a \"journo\", and this is one focused, confident guy. We couldn't do better for ownership than this group.\n136 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:48:40\nI thought it was a great performance from all concerned today. We should all be celebrating. Not sure why people want to discuss a player who left because he actually had the chance to.\nOliver.\nI suspect you're right. Hopefully we will have new owners and a new board soon because, if a concrete offer comes in for Onana, I think this crew would sell him in a heartbeat.\n137 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:49:36\nBy the way, Maupay was brilliant when he came on. He's a proper snide player. He wound up their players and they were going mad. It was great to see no more nice guy Everton.\n138 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:52:46\nYou're 100% accurate about Maupay.\nAnd the thing is, \"pretty\" teams and players HATE it when someone gets up in their gourd. Like absolutely hate it. It throws them off their game and rattles the bajeezuz out of them.\nMaupay did brilliantly and purposefully drove them mad.\n139 Posted 04/02/2023 at 16:54:13\nYou can go a long way with good spirit, hard work, good organisation and direct football. Well done, Dyche.\n140 Posted 04/02/2023 at 17:02:24\nSilence from the ultra doom merchants who had us dead and buried. Hope is back, bring on MotD.\n141 Posted 04/02/2023 at 17:05:52\nBut this has cheered me up some what, after a very stressful day. Thanks, Sean, for giving us belief!\n142 Posted 04/02/2023 at 17:10:29\n143 Posted 04/02/2023 at 17:13:06\nDon't knowâ€¦ if Onana is chased, it would be his decision, no matter who owns us.\n144 Posted 04/02/2023 at 17:13:28\n145 Posted 04/02/2023 at 17:16:50\nDycho Magnifico! ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµ\n146 Posted 04/02/2023 at 17:17:23\nWhere is Ian Edwards?\n147 Posted 04/02/2023 at 17:17:34\n148 Posted 04/02/2023 at 17:18:36\nEverton put fuming Piers Morgan in his place with perfect tweet after Arsenal win\n149 Posted 04/02/2023 at 17:41:56\n150 Posted 04/02/2023 at 17:55:03\nWhat a performance. Work ethic. Hustled. Harried. Fought. The win was fully justified. If Lampard was in charge for that game, we would have lost about 3-0.\nThe team was well organised. Dyche marshalled the team from the technical area and it was chalk and cheese from what we have seen this season.\nI'm feeling very optimistic. Marching to Glory.\nDyche, Dyche, baby!\n151 Posted 04/02/2023 at 17:55:34\nFootball is a simple game and Sean Dyche gave the squad simple instructions with the emphasis on working hard and doing it together. We could get better when Dyche has more time with them and nine days to the next game might see further improvement against a struggling Liverpool team.\nIt was great after the game to see so many happy faces — so different to the last home game 3 weeks ago when our future prospects weren't worth thinking about.\n152 Posted 04/02/2023 at 17:56:29\nHope all is good.\nKieran,\nShows the different attitude from a blow in, Onana, fighting for the jersey, and a local lad who threw the toys out of the pram, and didn't give a shit about the club.\n153 Posted 04/02/2023 at 17:57:46\nThe lad has been our best player all season. He is 21 and in a new league, he is going to be immense. He was absolutely brilliant today, the whole team and manager and crowd. UTFT\n155 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:07:55\nAfter watching weeks and weeks of utter dross, I woke up this morning with a bit of a hangover; didn't check my phone or TV or radio. I set off for what I was sure was a 3:00 pm kick-off, only to arrive at the ground at 2:15, to see 40,000 people streaming out with big grins on their faces!\nI thought it was a bit quiet walking up to the ground!! AAARRRGGH!!!\n156 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:09:13\nNobody came in for Onana. He won't have his loyalty tested until somebody does.\nThe local boy you want to chase all the way up the A1 stayed last season. He was unanimously voted Player of the Season..... by the other players. He all but threw Seamus over his shoulder and carried him for much of it.\nHow many times do you want him to do that?\nYou do realise that the current Everton players beat the league leaders today?\n157 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:10:37\nWhere do I start with today?\nA long trip up from London. Cancelled train and late but thank you to Peter for his patience. Genuine thanks, Peter. I can't thank you enough.\nOn the train to Euston, surrounded by gobby Arsenal supporters shouting about my city. One of them suggested I enjoy my sandwich. I nearly rammed it down his mouth and I'm a calm person. But a fighter.\nGreat to meet and hug Rob today. Great to see George.\nGreat to see the Blues win. Absolutely made up. They were great today. Competitive and fought.\nI don't know what it sounded like for those watching on the screen, but from where I was sat, it was ferocious from the Gwladys Street.\nMykolenko was first over as ever. Onana our best player by a mile. Pickford kept us in it.\nOnly at Crewe but smiling. Forever. The Anfield derby next. We go and fight. Especially against those bastards.\n158 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:12:25\nNo complaints and some great shifts put in today by all the squad.\nIt's a great start to Sean Dyche's Everton career, and now for next week.\nThe same attitude and effort again at our old ground please next Saturday.\nAll have a great night.\nðŸºðŸºðŸºðŸ¥ƒðŸ¥ƒðŸ¥ƒðŸ»\n159 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:15:25\nI have supported Everton since I was at primary school and I am now not too far off half a century. I do apologise for not being able to get up sooner but I live in Somerset so it wasn't easy with young childrenâ€¦\nAnyway what an experience, what an atmosphere and what incredible fans! Everyone was amazing, the players looked like they actually loved the club again and played with passion and fight. The fans, the peopleâ€¦ incredible!\nThank you to you all!\n160 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:21:34\nHe knows it's a tiny step against the distance we have to travel.\nStill magnificent, of course.\n161 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:21:48\nThink I hit a nerve. If you think he carried Seamus, that's your opinion. I saw a different Anthony who never supported or helped Coleman in any defensive duties whatsoever.\nPersonally, I thought Richarlison was our Player of the Season, just ahead of Pickford.\n162 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:22:10\nDyche has performed a miracle. Total change in attitude and players giving everything. I hope the new manager bounce continues into the next game to really make Klopp unhappy. That'd really make Dyche smile.\n163 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:22:55\nWe made Arsenal look ordinary through hard work, discipline and a lot of heart. Confidence is restored for today at least. There were times in games when we did show some fight under Lampard but it was never consistent and rarely lasted for 90 minutes, the draw at Man City apart.\nWe now know that these players can do it; Dyche was not bullshitting us when he talked the other day about there being quality in the squad. Now it's all about consistency and showing this level of effort until the end of the season because it is really tight in the bottom half of the league.\nMy favourite part of the day was seeing not only joy on the faces of the fans but on the players'. Loved it!\n164 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:26:11\n165 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:29:09\nIt's nice to see you have something positive to say about our club for a change, I hope you continue.\n-\n166 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:30:48\nDanny, glad you made the game and thanks to Mick and George for well wishes. As I posted earlier on the train up from London, first home game in 22 years â€“ absolutely buzzing!\nAlso got 15/2 odds. Nothing quite like winning when nobody gives us a chance! COYB!\n167 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:32:33\nIf Calvert-Lewin can stay healthy, we're in good shape. That to me is the biggest question mark going forward. Great to see Doucoure back and firing — he could also be vital if he gets in top form.\nMcNeil too was a different player. And as others have mentioned, Onana was and will be immense for us.\nIn addition to the structure of the team being night and day from before, there was a confidence and crispness to our game, not making stupid mistakes, that was pretty evident.\nRemarkable what a difference a top manager can make. Time to ride the momentum into Anfield next week.\n168 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:33:39\nI wasn't going to, to be honest, given the shit-show orchestrated by the Board over recent months, but I'm sure everyone knows the feeling when the game is getting close; “I'll just go and watch for a bit, love, probably be back pretty soonâ€¦â€\nAnyway, glad I did, cracking performance from the team and new hope for the future. Right, off to celebrate with a 㿀 pint of Stella!\n169 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:42:02\nAll respect to Dyche and the players who are here and wear the Blue of our great Club.\nHow the same bunch of wasters we've watched all season can turn a great performance in today is down to the manager and the one week he's spent with them.\nI have no doubt whatsoever that we will be moaning and groaning at times during the rest of the season due to shite individual and team performances but let's make the most of what we have witnessed today.\nEveryone put a shift in, which though the minimum expected, is what we have not seen so far this season.\nI must admit I was hoping at best not to get embarrassed today and thought an outside chance of a point. I was surprised at the starting eleven and even more surprised when Maupay came on but now I can see what a great substitution it was at the time.\nNow everything must be about us and our results and performances, we have to forget about the teams above us. I still think it will be really tight come the end of the season.\nA fantastic 3 points today; another 3 next week and our confidence will be sky high!!\nWell done to everyone today, team, management and supporters.\n170 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:44:44\nThis should be a day of celebration, but you cant stop talking about the guy who doesnt play for us anymore.\nHaving claimed he wouldnt stay for the fight, it must be difficult for you to be reminded that is exactly what he did and the players (those who were on the pitch) unanimously voted him Player of the Season.\nSeamus voted him player of the year for the way he fought the drop. So either your boy (and the rest of the squad) are talking nonsense... Or you are.\nLet's hope Onana gets Player of the Season for helping us to beat the drop this season.\n171 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:50:41\nYour second paragraph is key. Dyche was astute enough to assess the team, figure out what they can and can't do, and get them playing effectively within their ability levels. Frank sadly couldn't quite grasp their limitations and focussed on game plan and tactics first, and then tried to shoehorn the players into it.\nI don't expect an easy ride from here as everyone is fighting for their lives. But a heavy defeat (as predicted by many in the media) would have left us adrift with Southampton. Now, we are very much in the mix but, with 17 games left, there's enough football to recover from a few setbacks here and there as long as we generally do as well as we can.\n172 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:58:31\nBefore today, we were joint-bottom without a win since October and I wasn't into polishing turds.\n173 Posted 04/02/2023 at 18:59:26\nThere you go telling me I'm talking nonsense. I didn't say anything about who the player's picked, I just gave my opinion on Richarlison.\nBy the way I was just agreeing with Kieran's post. That's my final word on it, and agree completely, it's a day of celebration, and looking forward to watching us again on Match of the Day.\n174 Posted 04/02/2023 at 19:13:30\nBut you accused him of not having the loyalty or the fight...I saw him do it. So did the players (clearly) and so did the crowd.\nOnana is a more talented player. Let's hope he fights just as hard.\n175 Posted 04/02/2023 at 19:21:05\nI'm too old and stupid to link to it but I'm sure others can. It's the one where he talks about the fans and the need for him and the team to earn respect time after time.\nHe has true humility, not the fake sort.\n176 Posted 04/02/2023 at 19:21:09\nA standard game plan does not work at Everton. Dyche knew what to do. Set Everton up as a traditional English team which suits the ability of the players. You can even see players being stretched to play for the team.\nCalvert-Lewin was being pushed all the time, with Dyche giving him personnel instruction to keep him at it. Former Burnley players knew where to put the effort in and the whole midfield was gearing to getting forward early.\nThis really suited Onana and both Iowbi and Gyeue contributed well, with the defence snuffing out the effectiveness of Arsenal attacks. Dyche is the thinking man's Duncan Ferguson with the added confidence that he can do the job.\nThe crowd where immerse and their contribution to this performance cannot be under-estimated. The Board cannot claim credit for anything since they were not there. But today is for the manager and team; the Board can wait for their day of retribution.\n177 Posted 04/02/2023 at 19:30:14\nSorry, not long home. What a performance. Only one game, yes, but I saw exactly what I wanted to see.\nAmen. Wine time.\n178 Posted 04/02/2023 at 19:32:41\nAs much as I liked him personally, it's clear he'd completely lost the plot. Everyone was sticking forks in Mykolenko, but he showed what he could do today (defensively anyway... I think he's going to be trying (fruitlessly) to recreate that Leicester City goal for the rest of his career).\nThe only worrying thing â€“ and the reason the transfer window debacle still rankles â€“ is Calvert-Lewin's fitness. As good as Maupay is at making a nuisance of himself, he can't really do much of anything as a lone striker.\n179 Posted 04/02/2023 at 19:41:36\nIt's going to be a battle all the way, and we will need favours.\nFor instance, we could have done with Wolves, West Ham, and Leicester getting beat.\nJohn @ 148 said that Wolves & Leicester were never going to be in this relegation battle â€“ go look at the table, they are very much in it right now â€“ all from Palace down are in the mix.\nWe need to pick up points every game we play â€“ has to be the bar from now till the end of the season.\n180 Posted 04/02/2023 at 19:43:25\nI said it here the other day, Mykolenko is way better as a left-back than a wing-back.\n181 Posted 04/02/2023 at 19:43:54\nIn spite of the failings of Finch Farm, the rampant nepotism at the club, the disinterest of Moshiri, the inadequacy of Barrett-Baxendale, the lack of money, the limitations of Thelwell, the insistence on not playing youth, and the obstacle of Blue Bill clinging on... Sean Dyche and the players showed how to win a game of football against the Premier League leaders.\nNot that changing the manager makes much difference like...\n182 Posted 04/02/2023 at 19:44:09\nThis would end the war you started with the fans, add to a sense of change for the better, and we might even let you back in to watch.\nDo it and prove that you are not a selfish, arrogant ego-maniac. We are waiting.\n183 Posted 04/02/2023 at 19:47:38\nOn the firepower front, Michael posted our xG which emphasized that. I think that's why it's important McNeil keeps doing his Hinchcliffe impression and looking for goals on corners.\n184 Posted 04/02/2023 at 19:51:07\nIt's 3 points nobody was expecting us to get from the remaining games so a good start to the fight needed.\nAlot in Football hinges on the narrowest of margins. A referees decision, a var, one bad challenge. take today we score from a corner for first time this year ( if I'm right), coady blocks a certain goal off the line, dcl inches away from netting and dyche plays to them percentages.\nPressing when we have the right opportunities to gain the ball back not recklessly. Not playing little passes between Pickford and back 4 or short goal kicks ( just invites pressure) our back 4 are not that technical. Dyche played to the players strengths.\nPositivity goes along way with players, telling them to do what they are good at. Onana was inspired again, dacoure looked like had a point to prove and mcneil gave his best performance in a blue shirt.\nWe know we struggle with goals so midfield will be so important. We need a few of them to chip in with a few goals( I know its a big ask) but that maybe the difference between staying in the leauge. Dcl and maupay are not going to score our way out of this.\nWe have more than a fighting chance if we keep this up.\n185 Posted 04/02/2023 at 19:53:12\nSean Dyche's contribution was immense. He is a quality manager who has been so under-rated by many but not all.\nKeep up the great work from today. We look a different proposition now.\nBrought pride and hope back to Goodison Park.\nOnwards and upwards.\n186 Posted 04/02/2023 at 19:57:04\nYou could pick any player and extol their performance, but I'll pick three:\nMcNeil who I previously thought a waste of space and money, but whose defensive work was superb.\nColeman who has never lacked commitment, but who put in a display that reminded me how good he was a decade ago.\nAnd Onana who was for me the Man of the Match.\nBrilliant.\nWe're in with a fighting chance. Typical of Liverpool when we could have done with them winning, they blow it. Still they just might be in a real slump when we play them.\n187 Posted 04/02/2023 at 20:04:42\nRight from the start, the defensive setup was so totally different as was the work rate. I think Frank was running a holiday camp compared to what Dyche wants.\nYes we should have scored 2 goals early in the game but Arsenal should have too.\nThe Gunners came out a different team in the second but Everton had steeled up and worked so hard for each other to keep their threat to a minimum.\nOne game, I know, but surely this is a turning point.\n188 Posted 04/02/2023 at 20:16:57\nHopefully avoid a loss at Mordor (if not win!) and kick on against Leeds and Villa, both at home and both massive games. With any luck, by the end of February, we will be clear of the drop zone with a couple points buffer.\nWhat a difference a week makes, ey?\n189 Posted 04/02/2023 at 20:23:24\n190 Posted 04/02/2023 at 20:35:45\nPerhaps our board staying well clear is a lucky charm.\n191 Posted 04/02/2023 at 20:43:40\nBleep tests in training makes a massive change from the 6-a-side tippy-tappy bollocks under Frank and Benitez. They need to be properly worked and drilled.\n192 Posted 04/02/2023 at 20:48:58\nAt home in particular we're going to be tough to play against. Could even have won 3-0 today.\nFor those that like this sort of thing â€“ there's an interesting Tifo football analysis called \"Sean Dyche is not what you think\" on YouTube. Really worth a watch.\n193 Posted 04/02/2023 at 20:49:21\n194 Posted 04/02/2023 at 21:00:00\nI hope he is eating copious amounts of humble pie now, this is just the start, and although we have only moved up a place, a look at the Table shows just how a run of a few wins could catapult us up to where we should belong. After seeing Liverpool's abject showing the last few games, I see no reason why we can't get something there too.\n195 Posted 04/02/2023 at 21:05:20\nMcNeil's deliveries were superb today. So nice not to see Gordon â€“ I only want committed players and he became a big time Charlie for no reason.\n196 Posted 04/02/2023 at 21:33:19\nDyche isn't all about dour defensiveness. I thought his role for Doucoure was a smart one. And I doubt Gordon would have started for us today.\nOnana immense.\n197 Posted 04/02/2023 at 21:33:51\nWe may well go down, but for me, we more likely won't. April is when we normally see who'll 'probably' be the Champions and who'll be chumpions. We see it play out, season, after season, after season, after season.\nAnd Anfield, now that would be tickety-boo. And maybe, my post has the most commas ever, like. Great win today lads. Keep the faith.\n198 Posted 04/02/2023 at 21:38:07\nI had a little bit of silent reminiscing to myself, because I was proud of what these kids (they were kids when I really knew them) have achieved in football, and it was nice to think and begin to try to put my once very deep footballing head back on.\nI don't think Gueye touched the ball during the first 10 minutes but it was noticeable for a reason to me. He hadn't gone chasing, he had stayed very central, and it was great to see this discipline in our team.\nWe had condensed the space between the lines, and it was extremely difficult for Arsenal to play through us. I also saw more midfield interceptions in the first half, than I've seen in all the other games we have played â€“ put together this season?\nOther than the goal, my favourite moment came in the first minute of the second half, and it was great to read what the manager had told them at half-time, when I started reading on my iPad after watching more football this afternoon.\nYou have had a good half, but it's already gone, and you have got to do the same and even more again (or words to that effect) Dyche told his players, and watching today, it was the first thing I noticed in the first minute of the second half.\nLampard has gone, but his team rarely played for 90 minutes, and never, ever, came out looking ready and focused at the start of the second half. (Palace â€“ I know!) My thoughts today were that Lampard was actually trying to set us up like he was actually â€˜playing against us' rather than trying to concentrate on what suited this squad of players the most?\nPartnerships? We actually witnessed partnerships. Iwobi and McNeil, constantly tucking in and tracking back, and we even witnessed a threesome in the middle of our midfield!\nEarly days, a long way to go, but hopefully Dyche went straight down the tunnel thinking “I could really do something with this club, and it's absolutely mad, but brilliant supporters, and when I do, I will go and celebrate with them then!!â€\n199 Posted 04/02/2023 at 21:38:32\nToday we looked to have a plan, purpose and style (of sorts), which is something we have lacked, very early days under Dyche of course.\nLooking forward to the next match now, which seems forever away. After that we see what we can do against some of our fellow strugglers.\nDanny, glad you got to the game, result! Nicholas â€“ what a tragedy of a hangover! That is hilarious though.\n200 Posted 04/02/2023 at 21:42:02\nThe manner in which the manager reacted to the win was impressive, straight back into the dressing room and on the next game.\n201 Posted 04/02/2023 at 21:45:03\nOur side has too often risen to the challenge under caretaker coaches or the likes of Frank or Ancelotti before fading away a few games later.\nOne suspects that Sean is aware of this and is not going to let them suddenly think they are on Easy Street by defeating the Premier League leaders. He is absolutely right because this lot have the nasty habit of great one-off performances before sliding into oblivion.\n202 Posted 04/02/2023 at 21:45:13\nWe're long overdue for a manager with no limit to his ambitions and a realisation that he may be able to achieve many of them at Everton.\nIf Dyche turns out to be that man, who knows â€“ it may be the catalyst to the much-desired changes in the Boardroom and maybe even in the Club ownership.\n203 Posted 04/02/2023 at 21:45:55\nRandom question for anyone at the game:\nIt looked like the pitch had not been watered today prior to match and at halftime. If that's the case, wondering if another subtle, yet noticeable, move that took some of the zip out of Arsenal's passing game and made it a bit easier for us to sustain the fast paced running play all game?\n204 Posted 04/02/2023 at 21:50:35\nI love those young Evertonians. They deserve more than me.\n205 Posted 04/02/2023 at 21:53:23\nI was happy with the formation. Calvert-Lewin worked his socks off for 60 minutes. DoucourÃ© helped cover loads of ground in the midfield.\nOnana and Gana were fantastic. McNeil was back in his usual position and had his best game for us.\nThis is the standard going forward.\nCoyb...\n206 Posted 04/02/2023 at 22:00:47\nBrilliant â€“ you summed it up perfectly\n207 Posted 04/02/2023 at 22:02:01\nIt must have been a strange feeling. Was Woan there at the same time as you? Alan Myers says he's an Evertonian. So maybe you're influence and his will rub off on Sean.\n208 Posted 04/02/2023 at 22:04:21\nI've been meaning to ask this for months but from your posts are you based in London?\nI get the feeling I might have been on trains out of Euston with you when I had a season ticket pre-pandemic...\n209 Posted 04/02/2023 at 22:05:58\nCalvert-Lewin had a decent hour and looked full of energy but demonstrated, once again, that he's not an instinctive striker.\nAn all-round much improved performance and Dyche had them doing the simple things well.\n210 Posted 04/02/2023 at 22:11:28\nMcNeil has been dismissed routinely on here and yet we should note what confidence can do.\nWe're a great fan base but sometimes, with individual players, we're an absolute disgrace.\nBack them and they will thrive. Or if they don't, then we will have given them the best chance.\n211 Posted 04/02/2023 at 22:20:29\n212 Posted 04/02/2023 at 22:30:44\nOn the Vino Tinto, now, to save space, and listening to the Isley Brothers â€“ This Old Heart of Mine â€“ one of many tunes that resonates with Everton's fortunes the best part of the last 50 years.\nHopefully, true grit, guts, courage, the best Partizan support in the World, and this is effectively the start of Everton's season, today.\nCelebrate well and enjoy as suites; today has been earned and merited.\nUTFTs!\n214 Posted 04/02/2023 at 22:50:25\nHe told me he was signing for Bournemouth, but then Forest came in for him, but his biggest regret was when Colin Harvey, came to watch him playing for Runcorn, and he had a nightmare of a game.\nIt's probably ended up working out better for him because he obviously met a mate for life, with Dyche, and had a very successful career at Forest, which isn't bad for a kid who was playing for Runcorn. Hopefully his destiny with the Blues is going to be the icing on the cake for all three of them!\n215 Posted 04/02/2023 at 23:00:41\nIn a matter of a few days, he has transformed these players into an effective unit.\nWell done, Sean Dyche, for giving me a weekend where I was not totally depressed and falling out of love with football.\n216 Posted 04/02/2023 at 23:16:38\nGawd knows what the real twats use to come up with their bizarre numbers... but I'm sure they'll tell me on MotD.\n217 Posted 04/02/2023 at 23:23:44\nLet's just hope that this performance is not watered down at that lot's ground next week. Keep that intensity up and we stay up. 6 more games to win.\n218 Posted 04/02/2023 at 23:32:42\nThe result wasn't in doubt as far as I was concerned: only if Everton did an Everton did I think we would relinquish the points. A great win, a great atmosphere, and a great 3 points.\nUnfortunately it's only one stop in what's going to be a testing few months. one small step for Everton thanks to one giant leap from Tarkowski. Only downside, none of me or my mates took the odds of 7-1 on an Everton win prior to the game.\n219 Posted 04/02/2023 at 23:37:19\nI don't know about prior to the game, but at half-time there was a great deal of watering going on in both halves of the pitch.\n220 Posted 04/02/2023 at 23:38:19\nMaupay played his role and gave everything he could. But that role was only to wind them up, not to really offer anything in terms of the football. We ceased to exist as an attacking threat when he came on.\nAs a lone striker option â€“ he's barely an option. He would be more effective with a partner but with only two senior strikers I can't see that happening. I thought his performance highlighted exactly why we needed to sign a striker who can take some load off Calvert-Lewin (who I thought was revitalised for an hour).\nWe need to enjoy this but be careful about getting carried away. It's not suddenly a great team and the same weaknesses were there.\nWe will struggle to create chances and score goals. We lack quality on the ball and will make mistakes. Our full-backs will struggle to impact the game going forward.\nDoucourÃ© still struggles with the ball and Gueye still goes into reverse when he gets the ball. The only player who really surprised me was McNeil, who looked like he was 3 yards faster and 100% more determined.\nThey all put in a monumental effort â€“ the sort that simply can't happen every week unless you're caffeine dosed or falsely diagnosed as asthmatic.\nHopefully we can get a similar effort next week. That lot look very vulnerable. I'm always wary of thinking there's any good time to play them... but it feels like a good time to play them!\nQuick note on corners. They looked comfortably our biggest threat. Back to the days of Joe Royle and him identifying a key advantage (remember \"Ooh, it's a corner\"?). There wasn't one amazing delivery â€“ it was the opposite.\nHang it long, nothing flashy, away from the keeper and give our tall timber something to fight for. Calvert-Lewin, Onana, Tarkowski, Coady, DoucourÃ© are going to love that â€“ who in the league would want to match up against that kind of size onslaught?\nIt's playing with a plan. You don't need to whip in pacy corners and screw half of them up when you've got that kind of size. Those players want the ball stood up for them to attack.\n221 Posted 04/02/2023 at 23:42:47\nI posted on another thread but, given your post, it's better suited here.\nMaupay, what is he good for? Absolutely nothing, he might prove me wrong over time but I just can't see what he offers to the team.\n222 Posted 04/02/2023 at 23:48:20\nAbsolutely delighted with the boys today.\nI'm still disappointed at the overt Police presence in the ground, both on the terraces and the concourse at half-time. Two stood in front of me looking at us as if I was going to cause trouble. And more stewards than I'm used to.\nAnyway, it doesn't distract from a great day and result.\n223 Posted 04/02/2023 at 23:53:26\nYes, mate, these young Bues who never seen a trophy are amazing. Goodison rammed with youth. Groups of young lads. Kids with parents, every week.\nThese don't remember the glory days. I'm too young myself. Yet they are there week-in & week-out through all the shit management, shit teams, shit football. That's what the board should see, these young Blues deserve better.\nLet's hope this result is the start for them!!!\n224 Posted 04/02/2023 at 23:56:49\nToo many times in the past, and so I hope next week Everton play their game, and fuck the RS!\nThe survival plan for this season, salvage has started well, and so now to our old ground.\nTake a point, and hopefully beat them, I'm taking McNeil to stick in a cross in the Kop goal and Calvert-Lewin to get a couple.\nUTFTs!\n225 Posted 04/02/2023 at 00:12:05\nDom, it's always worth putting the miles in to follow the blues. I often get asked if it was worth it.\nIt always is, even when they upset me. They made me proud today.\nI may not sleep a lot tonight.\n226 Posted 04/02/2023 at 00:16:38\nWe were well over an hour getting out today for reasons which are unclear but it was particularly ridiculous and it is always awful.\nFor 㾶 every time it is not acceptable. Parking is generally terrible for the \"privilege\" of watching the team but I strongly recommend alternatives to the Stanley Park traffic jam. It would be quicker to travel by pogo stick.\n227 Posted 05/02/2023 at 00:33:12\nNo worries, I don't even know where to find the xG. So I'll just go with your unofficial version.\n228 Posted 05/02/2023 at 00:34:42\nI normally in the one off St Domingo Road that is about 300 yards up from Everton Valley on the left-hand side. Secure, ٥ (cash only) and takes about 10-15 mins to get out.\n229 Posted 05/02/2023 at 00:45:47\nA great day for Everton! True Grit, and The Best Supporters in the World.\nUTFTs!\n230 Posted 05/02/2023 at 00:49:50\n231 Posted 05/02/2023 at 00:53:57\nWe did not add a player during January but we have the best transfer period of all the Premier League teams. I wanted Bielsa but Dyche was the answer.\nI know it is only one game but we watched a team with an attacking and defensive system. Dyche in 5 days did more than the illiterate in a year.\n232 Posted 05/02/2023 at 00:58:42\nEpic, Everton, is a lifetime journey, but what a journey... Never a dull moment.\nFair dos from Arsenal mates, who came up today, and had no issues with the best team winning today. As they said, we would win due to the manager bounce in mid-week.\nThey didn't fancy the ultimate Everton of all natural causes. Everton today at times were supernatural in context of their focus. That stuck to me today: the players played like their lives depended on that game.\nEverton stopped Arsenal playing, squeezed them out of space. Regardless, all stick together, and this is the start, and we have Real Hope.\nVery well done, Sean Dyche and his team, and the Everton first-team squad.\nUTFTs!\n233 Posted 05/02/2023 at 00:59:44\nI reckon I might have seen you getting on the Metropolitan Line a lot a few years ago. Your references to your age fit in with that.\nI'm Finchley Road and I bloody hate it there when we play Arsenal! Until today...\nI think getting from Uxbridge to Euston to Lime Street is one heck of a journey so fair play there!\n234 Posted 05/02/2023 at 01:10:28\nMy gripe, the adverts, coming up on TW, with Mr Ed, on some kitchen installation firm?\nThe last week, it's default on request...\nNot previously, noticed, but now on every access attempt to TW.\nThank you,\n235 Posted 05/02/2023 at 01:20:47\n236 Posted 05/02/2023 at 01:28:07\nBy my count, his defensive pressure up top forced four Arsenal giveaways in his 30+ minutes on the pitch.\n237 Posted 05/02/2023 at 01:36:38\nUp the Toffees.\n238 Posted 05/02/2023 at 01:47:14\nHe must have read Darren's comments. Proper blue. Born not manufactured.\n239 Posted 05/02/2023 at 02:33:00\n240 Posted 05/02/2023 at 03:01:20\n241 Posted 05/02/2023 at 03:27:37\nLove it!\n242 Posted 05/02/2023 at 03:58:02\n243 Posted 05/02/2023 at 04:15:15\nI sort of felt it is the game that we might get something out of because The Gunners did not have an impressive record at Goodison. And also, they have a 5 points buffer up top so the players must feel a bit lax. For us, no one expects us to win so, as long the players gave everything, the crowd would be pleased. And we actually did it! Yay!\nDoucoure is my MotD. He is both attacking and defending. His long legs did help to just nick the ball away at times. And he could find an outlet to pass to when crowded in our own half. I think Lampard writing him off was a mistake.\nTo credit Lampard, he did fix our defence this season. What he failed with was to over-complicate things when attacking. Also, perhaps trying too hard to get that winning goal and, as a result, open up our defence to the counter-attack.\nDyche, however, is a pragmatist. Keep solidifying our defence and play simple direct balls to the top, forcing corners. The set-pieces must have been drilled as the ball was delivered again and again to the far post.\nI think the logic is that, even if the defender won the header, it either goes out as another corner or a clearance that won't go too far (likely to be still within the box). Highly likely to get a second chance or forcing any silly challenges to lead to a penalty. Well thought-out!\nCOYB!\n244 Posted 05/02/2023 at 04:21:15\nhttps://youtu.be/6bUUZynLZR8\n245 Posted 05/02/2023 at 06:16:13\nI'll be there in July â€“ doing the India Pacific from Sydney with some good friends from Victoria. Planning to go to Margaret River, which we've never before visited.\nIf you're in Adelaide any time let me know, too. It's a while since I've been to the Lockleys.\n246 Posted 05/02/2023 at 06:59:38\nThe only thing is â€¦ I'd transitioned painfully through disbelief, anger and denial, settling firmly in resignation to relegation. I was sure we'd be one of the 3 worst teams in the Premier League. Now I'm not so sure. Straight back to disbelief.\nDammit, it's the hope that kills me.\nCOYB\n247 Posted 05/02/2023 at 07:52:17\nOnwards & upwards!\nCOYBs\n248 Posted 05/02/2023 at 07:58:00\nHe said he knows this club's identity, and he was right. We're not a tippy tappy team, never have been. We're a team that have always been, through our history, a bastard to play against.\n249 Posted 05/02/2023 at 08:04:36\n250 Posted 05/02/2023 at 08:14:09\nI said before the match that I thought there was still a very good chance we may get relegated but that even so Dyche would prove the most popular manager we've had in a long time.\nOne swallow does not a summer make and all that but I suspect Dyche may continue to make it clear what a dubious choice Lampard was by the board (and a fair few fans); very nice guy but very mediocre manager.\nThis team has more recently not lacked hard workers but it has lacked solid organisation and identity. Hopefully we have seen the start of those vital elements being restored. Long way to go yet.\n251 Posted 05/02/2023 at 09:42:02\nPassion, teamwork, discipline, skill, organisation, and hard work.\nHis game management was spot on too. Swapping wingers after the adrenaline spike wore off, changing formations throughout to deal with problems, and rotating the number 10 role. He was like a conductor at times. Early days, but very impressed.\n252 Posted 05/02/2023 at 10:01:40\nI've no idea why but I don't get any ads, at all.\n253 Posted 05/02/2023 at 10:39:34\nHe had Saka in his pocket, like he had Salah last season, it's just going forward where he struggles.\nAmazing win, all's you can say is, Everton that; turned over by the bottom club and the struggling 'Ammers, and beat the runaway leaders quite comfortably.\nHowever, one swallow and all that and to state the bleedin' obvious we need 20 points to be sure of survival, but I suppose if anyone can, Dyche can.\n254 Posted 05/02/2023 at 11:02:51\nThe one thing I noticed that I'm sure the manager will highlight was Iwobi in the second half. He was constantly on the wrong side but kept shuffling slowly back rather than sprinting back. McNeill was outstanding in the same role on the other side.\nLet's pray that the late appointment doesn't come back to haunt us. If Dyche would have had Wolves, Southampton and Brighton at home plus West Ham away, you'd think we'd be a minimum of 6 points better right now and not in semi panic mode.\n255 Posted 05/02/2023 at 11:06:01\nNext it's Mordor. We all know what 'Everton that' means for Monday week. So don't let it happen blues. Win for the badge, win for each other, win for the fans but most of all win to stay up. WE ARE EVERTON. COYBs !!!!!\nPS: I thought the ref had a good game. More like him for the rest of the season please.\n256 Posted 05/02/2023 at 11:20:52\n257 Posted 05/02/2023 at 11:22:11\n258 Posted 05/02/2023 at 11:28:15\nI feel their disappointment.\n259 Posted 05/02/2023 at 11:28:38\n260 Posted 05/02/2023 at 11:51:34\n261 Posted 05/02/2023 at 11:58:49\n262 Posted 05/02/2023 at 12:04:46\n263 Posted 05/02/2023 at 12:04:47\n264 Posted 05/02/2023 at 12:06:07\nIt's only one game but my oh my Tony A's old mates from Forest could really take us on a journey we've been waiting a long time for.\nA team that fights for everything and plays with passion.\nHow things can change in a week. Targets change with that as I now want 9 points from his first 3 games, lol.\n266 Posted 05/02/2023 at 12:56:02\nWhat really worries me, is the New Stadium Access with an even potential larger capacity, very few Parking Facilities for the match going fans. Basically there is only one access road, which they have partially converted to a dual carriageway, which goes towards town and the Tunnels, or towards Seaforth/Bootle and access to M57/58 via Switch Island. There are some roads running up off the Dock Road to Regent Road and Vauxhall Road.\nSeveral of us have tried getting there by train, and the shortest journey on foot from Sandhills takes approximately 15 minutes. As far as I know there are no plans for an extra Station, if there is, they have left it late! Equally, little mention of any Ferry Services which would alleviate the entry and exodus a little.\nI can't foresee any solution as things are at present, but would be interested if anyone else has similar concerns, or indeed knows of any developments that may be in the pipeline.\n267 Posted 05/02/2023 at 13:19:26\nOn a tangent, I didn't realise Dyche's son, Max, plays as a defender at Northampton.\n268 Posted 05/02/2023 at 13:24:37\nAnd imagine what iti/s going to be like getting away from that windy Dock at ten o'clock on a Tuesday night. So we're adding ten thousand to the crowd, and reducing the access by what, two-thirds? Then again, I'm sure a well-run club like Everton already has these intractable issues well in hand.\n269 Posted 05/02/2023 at 14:26:00\nI know. I just must have bumped into the Inslington village idiots as I spend most of my time surrounded by opposition supporters up and down the country as well as at home and have no problems.\nCatch you all at the next one. I'm not getting carried away, but I've not come down yet.\n270 Posted 05/02/2023 at 14:43:19\n271 Posted 05/02/2023 at 14:58:16\n272 Posted 05/02/2023 at 15:02:04\nWhy would you be racing off at 10 in the evening? Surely, you'd be deciding between the nightclub & the casino to while away an hour or two!\n273 Posted 05/02/2023 at 15:06:22\n274 Posted 05/02/2023 at 15:08:24\nI was wondering what happened to the snidey little shithouse who use to play for Brighton, and instead we'd got his peace-loving hippy brother.\nA target man he ain't and I think he would be effective in a 2, but his wind-ups were a joy to behold yesterday.\n276 Posted 05/02/2023 at 16:16:38\nVehicle access to the Brighton Amex Stadium is basically a no no. The club run a park and ride bus service from numerous locations in and around Brighton.\nThey also have the advantage of a railway station (Ringmer) which has been considerably upgraded, but quite a jostle to get down onto the platform with 3or 4 carriage (can't remember) trains every 20-30 mins. The Amex basically is in the middle of nowhere.\nNot sure how many coaches are accommodated in the stadium coach park, but plenty.\nPerhaps BK could have a word with Tony Bloom how to run a football club commercially ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚\n277 Posted 05/02/2023 at 16:36:19\nFalmer also serves the University of Sussex and is the 3rd station east of Brighton station, after London Road and Moulsecoomb, and one stop from Lewes (7 minutes) where many BHA and away fans gather to use the excellent pubs and local Harvey's ale in this town.\n278 Posted 05/02/2023 at 17:35:39\n279 Posted 05/02/2023 at 18:00:53\nAll points gained now will be gratefully accepted.\nThe formation of the midfield and hard work of yesterday is what is going to help Everton survive.\nThe problems up front still continue but Everton have some really tall players who can cause quite a lot in opponents penalty areas.\nMcNeil is a very good crosser of the ball and if he continues to show what he did yesterday then he can be a real asset to the offence.\n280 Posted 05/02/2023 at 18:38:40\nAnd then then we stand in the Arkles (their pub), telling them it's our City.\nSorry. Getting wound up already.\nWhen we beat them, we won't be that far off them.\n281 Posted 05/02/2023 at 19:03:30\n282 Posted 05/02/2023 at 19:36:44\nOnce again Peter, thank you for Saturday. It meant so much. I owe you big time and will repay you.\nTrue gentleman and Evertonian.\nExpect a few rants off me this week or so. I'll be going into conflict with family and friends and surrounded by London reds trying to wind me up.\nIt's that time of year when I realise how much I despise that club.\n283 Posted 05/02/2023 at 19:47:39\nI share your disdain for our neighbours.\n284 Posted 05/02/2023 at 20:13:17\n285 Posted 05/02/2023 at 20:16:25\nhttps://www.footballtransfertavern.com/everton-fc-news/everton-pierre-emerick-aubameyang-latest-transfer-news-rumours-updates/\nYeah, I know, it's a rubbish website who probably don't speak a word of truth.\n286 Posted 05/02/2023 at 20:35:59\nIt's one thing getting a ticket, but I hope you didn't keep him waiting outside, but your dedication to Everton, is fantastic Danny, and genuine Evertonians, always stick together and look out for each other.\nDid he keep you waiting Peter? It's a good job I phoned him because although he's got a ticket for Anfield, I don't think he realised it was a Monday night game, so he definitely should listen to you mate, and start pacing himself!!\n287 Posted 05/02/2023 at 22:30:30\nIt was a great day.\n288 Posted 06/02/2023 at 01:22:23\nHowever a special mention for Maupay. He hasn't had the easiest time since his arrival at the club and has shown little to warrant selection. But on Saturday he put himself about, got in the faces of the opposition, rattled them and generally made a nuisance of himself.\nIf DCL is unfit for the Derby, I would have no qualms whatsoever selecting Maupay to lead the line. A similar showing against Liverpool could prove him to be a vital cog in the team. I could see him niggling their defenders and unsettling them. They've looked unusually shaky of late, Maupay could be the one to take advantage of any slip ups. COYB.\n289 Posted 06/02/2023 at 04:17:17\nPhil, if we play Maupay up top on his own then the best we can hope for is 0-0. We won't get out of our half.\nNot that I didn't enjoy his shithousery on Saturday, because I did, but it's not a 90 minute plan. He offered very little besides his cunning.\n290 Posted 06/02/2023 at 04:50:31\nIf DCL is injured again he may as well retire. He's barely played in two years. Sean asked him to make a modicum of effort for an hour during which time he missed two easy chances. If that exertion was too much for him then call it quits and stop wasting our money on this joker. He's getting paid a fortune for going through the motions and showing up in training in his snood, tights and wooly hat while offering nothing in terms of productivity.\n291 Posted 06/02/2023 at 05:01:15\nI did keep Peter waiting, but he was a true Gentleman and held out for me.\nIt was a great occasion. Goodison at it's best.\nI even got served at half time.\nWe are a family and whenever any of you travel down to London, let me know. I'll look after you. Peter, so grateful. I can't say it enough.\nPreparing myself for the obvious. At least I know what time kick off is now!! Thank you for the reminder Tony!\n292 Posted 06/02/2023 at 05:10:37\nFrom 2 days ago:\n293 Posted 06/02/2023 at 07:30:45\nMy thoughts at the end of the Saturday's game, actually turned towards Bramley Moore. Just get safe Everton, then we will have a much better final year at Goodison Pk, without the Jonah, whilst looking forward to moving onto the banks of the Royal Blue Mersey.\n294 Posted 06/02/2023 at 08:07:59\n295 Posted 06/02/2023 at 08:17:33\nThen we can look to the future dominating that famous riverside even though it will break my heart to leave Goodison.\nThat new stadium will put us back on the map and is an opportunity.\nLet's just hope we've got people in charge to make the most of it.\n296 Posted 06/02/2023 at 08:22:16\nI think it's going to be like West Ham's stadium, Derek, but they have got a train station ten minutes away, and they seem to cope very well. It's a bit slow getting to and on the train, but once you do get through it's fine, and everywhere becomes accessible again.\n297 Posted 06/02/2023 at 08:25:34\nA Monorail from Brunswick to Bramley with stops on the way.\nA modern tribute to the Docker's Umbrella that serves not just Everton, but the city.\n298 Posted 06/02/2023 at 08:40:46\n299 Posted 06/02/2023 at 08:48:40\nI still have nightmares about Howard-Distin-Stones parping about at the back. That time Stones told the Park End to calm down was one of the worst instances.\n300 Posted 06/02/2023 at 08:50:55\nLike Tony, I want to go and see how The New Everton Stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock is coming on. My favourite way is getting the bus over to Liscard, having a tea and two rounds of toast in the Wetherspoons, then off for a walk down to the prom and take a look at our new ground from the Birkenhead side.\nIt looks graceful does our new home! I walk along to New Brighton and keep turning back to see it as I stroll along. Wonderful!\nI feel now, that we've got a chance to enter our new home as supporters of a Premier League Club!\n301 Posted 06/02/2023 at 08:51:39\nThis is a similar distance from Kirkdale to Goodison, and it is served by 12 trains an hour each way from Central Station.\n302 Posted 06/02/2023 at 08:56:33\nJust get safe, Everton, then we will have a much better final year at Goodison Park.\nWe'll have a little longer than that. Tony. ;-)\n303 Posted 06/02/2023 at 09:00:15\nSince then of course a lot has happened or not happened with work connected to the council at that time.\n304 Posted 06/02/2023 at 09:08:19\n2 things that are just not in Everton's DNA: tippy-tappy and 3 at the back with wingbacks. Guess what Frank had us doing?\nI give him credit as a player but, to be fair, he is hopeless as a coach. I think this will finish him.\n305 Posted 06/02/2023 at 09:19:16\nYes, I remember Joe Anderson making all the right sounds about the new Stadium etc, but as he has now been deposed, is it Steve Rotherham (a self-confessed RS) who isn't doing much at all.\nBy the way, what is the situation with Joe Anderson over the alleged fraud accusations? Did he get charged, do time in Walton, or just disappear off the scene with a big fat pension or pay-off?\nAnswers in a brown envelope please, or better still back on here. :-)\n306 Posted 06/02/2023 at 09:23:35\nConcerning our beloved mayor, I think the outcome, Derek, was that there was insufficient evidence!!!\n307 Posted 06/02/2023 at 09:28:45\nJust getting safe isn't going to be good enough to have an enjoyable last season at Goodison Park. Hopefully Dyche is going to put some character and substance to the team but we have to break the slowly downward cycle we have been in for a few years and not just continue what we have been doing.\nAt the end of the season, our FFP situation will presumably have eased and the club must allow Dyche and Thelwell to put significant investment into improving the squad. If not, we will be in the same position this time next season.\n308 Posted 06/02/2023 at 09:35:41\n309 Posted 06/02/2023 at 09:46:05\nAs always, the fans are the last to be considered, and having driven past the new ground and surrounding areas — where are the parking facilities?\nTalk of Sandhills Station â€“ it just couldn't cope, unlike London (where trains run every minute), we're lucky to see a 15-minute service on any train route in the city.\nI had hoped that a couple of Park-and-Ride venues would have been identified â€“ works perfectly at the Open golf.\nI suggested over 12 months ago about a ferry from the other side of the Mersey and a landing stage outside the ground. I believe a ferry can carry 2,500 people, so you could disperse the crowds quickly using the ferries.\nBut no; they will do nothing. And if it takes a couple of hours for you to exit the game and get home to various parts of the cityâ€¦ unlucky.\n310 Posted 06/02/2023 at 09:46:37\nI'll be in tears, but we can send her away in fitting respect. Don't call me 'Bill' â€“ mine will be genuine. I will be as gutted as I will be proud and happy.\nI'd actually like Everton to have done something different to the plan they have, which I know is befitting and benefiting the community. But over time, that community will lose a lot once Everton leave. I guess a lot of us will still go to the places we grew up with, but those local places will suffer.\nGoodison is going to be demolished (tears) and the club / council are going to invest in what is laid on the hollow ground... I'd liked to have seen them redevelop a downscaled stadium fit for the development teams to play on. I think that would have been a great legacy and inspiration for future generations of Everton players.\nThis is going to be an emotional 18 months.\n311 Posted 06/02/2023 at 09:59:04\nI don't know with living outside the city that you have heard that the local businesses around the ground like the Wilmslow and the chippy and the Wok are getting together to try and organise a Park-and-Ride from the Wilmslow to the new Everton Stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock.\nSo, if fans wanted, they can still go the Wilmslow and have a pint before the game, and they will put buses on to take you and bring you back. Seems like these local businesses have more of an idea than the club.\n312 Posted 06/02/2023 at 10:02:21\nI wonder if the Fat Controller had any say in this?\n313 Posted 06/02/2023 at 10:07:11\n314 Posted 06/02/2023 at 10:14:30\nDerek - always a positive!!\nAnd I can't go to watch Everton at home with out going to the Goodison Supper Bar.\nAnd for my sins, having one in the Arkles for my Grandad. Not looking forward to that next time out but I will do it.\n315 Posted 06/02/2023 at 10:34:31\nThere is a new Facebook page called Keep Business in L4 and part of the plan is to run shuttle buses. The owners of the Winslow are involved I think.\nI'll be sorry to leave Goodison but have to say I won't miss the streets between Kirkdale station and County Road. Never seen so much dogshit and litter. The residents obviously don't care.\n316 Posted 06/02/2023 at 10:42:50\nWe just looked so much hungrier, compact, organised and aggressive than we have all season. Back 4 worked a treat - why Lampard got so obsessed with a back 3/5 I'll never know!\nGreat spirit from the players too and they finally looked like they all knew their roles/what they were doing in and out of possession.\nGood to see a desire to play forward too and actually get the ball in the box. Trying to score might well catch on haha.\nCredit to Dyche for such a massive turnaround from how we have been playing in previous weeks. Looks like he has kept it really simple and easy to understand in terms of tactics/instructions, which is what our players need.\nLoving getting that old Dogs of War feel back and some passion to inspire us fans with.\nLet's see if we can build on this now and it's not another false dawn. I can't see Dyche letting levels slip though as other managers have. Really do fancy us to beat the other lot with how they're doing right now!\nDoes anyone know why Zinchenko was so wound up at the final whistle by the way?\n317 Posted 06/02/2023 at 10:47:38\nThis is going to be an emotional 18 months.\nDanny I'll say what I said to Tony A. You'll have longer than 18 months, so don't worry.\n318 Posted 06/02/2023 at 10:57:07\nPaul, I know some love the Dogs of War. Personally I was not a real fan. It was a necessity. I was preached as a kid about the School of Science and the Holy Trinity, who's statue I look at every time I go to Goodison. So I guess I'm a Romanist.\nI know what you mean though Paul, regardless of ability, you have to work hard and earn the right to play football. The team done that on Saturday and we need to take it to that place next time out and get in their faces.\nEven my boyhood heroes of the 80s had to work to earn the right to play their flowing, sweeping football.\nApart from Kevin Sheedy. He walked on water and done his thing!!! Because he could.\nHere's to one of our players sticking two fingers up at the Satanic Palace (Kop). Just don't lose this time.\nKopites are . every single one of them.\nI'm probably getting too emotional in the build up. I will likely be told to calm down.\n319 Posted 06/02/2023 at 11:13:57\n320 Posted 06/02/2023 at 11:33:54\nApologies Falmer station.\nI live in Crowborough, was a season ticket holder at Goodison until last season (I'll health). But born a scouser, always a scouser. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚\nWaiting for a train in the wind and rain is a nightmare, when I go we park in Lewes and catch the train.\nSeason ticket holders get free travel to and from the stadium, I don't think anybody at Lewes station bother checking for tickets as everybody seems to push through. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚\n321 Posted 06/02/2023 at 11:45:44\nWhen the dust finally settles. I think the most precious memory I will take from Saturday is that glorious cameo from Maupay. It's not an exaggeration to say that that boy is a true shithouse. It's so great to see a master of his craft in the royal blue.\n322 Posted 06/02/2023 at 11:48:22\n323 Posted 06/02/2023 at 12:14:24\nI foresee a red card or two!\n324 Posted 06/02/2023 at 12:20:18\nTodays fan seems to be more impressed by the individual rather than what a player brings to the overall team.\nSAF sold Ronaldo as he was too selfish and wanted all the glory.\nEarly last season Man U were worse when they brought both Ronaldo and Pogba on.\nFor me, Saturday was a team performance first and foremost which then allowed the likes of Onana to show his individual talent when appropriate.\nWe haven't had a real team ethic for a decade.\n325 Posted 06/02/2023 at 12:52:37\n326 Posted 06/02/2023 at 13:10:36\nSadly I don't get to Goodison much...so I watch Lewes (Isthmian Premier) instead.\nWhere are you in Crowborough..I have close friends there.\n327 Posted 06/02/2023 at 13:18:07\nSheedy played the game at his own pace but contributed to what was an outstanding team.\nEven though he was played wide despite not being a natural or pacy winger. I actually thought he was better in a more central position. I suppose what we would now call the number 10 position.\nYou'll have to forgive me. He's my favourite of all time.\nIt was interesting seeing Anthony Gordon come on yesterday and being played more central than we used him. I did often say I see him as an eventual number 10 rather than where we were playing him.\nWe have history. Poor Leon was played out wide for years and slated. It was obvious he was a central player. Well to me anyway. But then again, I'm no expert. But what a technically gifted player wasted out wide through no fault of his own.\n328 Posted 06/02/2023 at 13:22:20\n329 Posted 06/02/2023 at 13:30:24\nWe have drew at City, beat Arsenal, but have lost every other game for a long time, and mostly against equal or even inferior opposition to ourselves, so there are still massive question marks about the desire and capabilities of these players.\nHopefully Dyche can root the problems out, but it only takes a couple of bad apples, unless it's real discipline, that this squad has needed for years?ðŸ¤ž\nWhen the fans turned on the players, because the board had told lies, and failed to turn up, leaving the exasperated fans with nobody to turn their anger on, I didn't really like them singing “you're not fit to wear the shirt, to the very dejected playersâ€¦ But Saturday proved the fans were correct, when you look at the incredible difference in performance, from the Southampton to the Arsenal game.\n“â€Disciplineâ€â€ is the key, both behind the scenes and out on the pitch, and once you get this right, I'm almost certain that everything will slowly start falling into place?\n330 Posted 06/02/2023 at 13:47:35\nIt was like two completely different teams from the last few games an most of franks time.\nGotta push on now and I don't think Dyche will let them settle.\nOnana class and McNeil much better in the position he played at Burnley for years.\nCOYB\n331 Posted 06/02/2023 at 13:49:02\nI've been listening to Peter Gabriel, singing Humdrum, in homage to Bill Kenwright, finally tripping himself up with a truly disgraceful and disgusting lie.\nI RIDE TANDOM WITH A RANDOM BUT THINGS DON'T RUN THE WAY I PLANNED THEM IN THE HUMDRUM!\nYou created a humdrum at Everton, many, many years ago William, but it's hopefully all going to be over soon, because you finally tripped yourself up, just like many have hoped for, and also predicted, for many, many years. Thank you.\n332 Posted 06/02/2023 at 14:52:34\nA very, very underrated footballer.\n333 Posted 06/02/2023 at 16:04:32\nI was sat in the Main Stand with a few City fans just behind me and they had nothing but compliments.\n334 Posted 06/02/2023 at 16:42:53\n\"Liverpool's abandoned St James Station is set to reopen in 2025 as Liverpool Baltic Station. \"Plans to reopen the station, in the city's Baltic Triangle district, are going ahead with funding secured from central government. The current plan is for the station to open in 2025, with a planning application to be made in 2023 and construction to start in 2024.\"\nThe station would be located between Liverpool Central and Brunswick Station on the Northern Line\nThe site is on the corner of Park Road and Parliament Street. The link has a couple of photos and drawings.\n335 Posted 06/02/2023 at 16:43:30\nWith the size of some of the dog turds in Westminster Road, they'd require planning permission in London.\n336 Posted 06/02/2023 at 17:26:25\nBob Dylan yesterday; Peter Gabriel today. Some classic music there, mate, and I hope it comes about. He's always thought that he comes first from The Kings Dock to now. Hopefully, finally we get investors in, who can call a special meeting to get rid of him.\nTill then, if he stays away, and takes his oppos with him, that would do for starters!\nIf going to look at the King's Dock in the daytime, park your car near Sandhills, and walk up to the platform. Then walk down towards the Town end of the platform, as soon as you come to the open part, you get a fantastic view of our Ground overlooking the Royal Blue Mersey! It's stunning!\n337 Posted 06/02/2023 at 17:31:02\nYep, shit website, hasn't Aubamayang already played for Barca and Chelsea this season? And you can't play for more than 2 teams in one season.\n338 Posted 06/02/2023 at 17:44:27\n339 Posted 06/02/2023 at 17:46:38\nDon't I know it! I live by Wessy Road. The councillors for our district have done fuck-all, no matter how many complaints.\nMind you, if you see some of the dogs!!!\n340 Posted 06/02/2023 at 18:20:31\nSorry for any offence but the area from the Albany down Delamore Street, front and back, is as bad as I've seen anywhere. Must be a nightmare for the majority of good people who live there.\n341 Posted 06/02/2023 at 18:43:24\nI know the Albany, it's about a 100 yards from where I live. So I well understand your view.\n342 Posted 06/02/2023 at 19:33:56\nI see where Klopp threw his toys out of the pram again, refusing to answer a question from James Pearce of the Athletic, totally insulting. Adifferent reporter had to ask the same question. Why don't Sky Sports and the BBC show his real personality?\n343 Posted 06/02/2023 at 19:39:02\nThe Bobble who gets to know things a lot earlier than the rest of us has just tweeted Calvert-Lewin scan has shown nothing so they will monitor him from day to day. I thought it was interesting that Dyche said he told him that he was fitter than he thought he was.\nI guess the bleep tests they did and other things showed that maybe Dom is worrying too much over little niggles that most players play with.\n344 Posted 06/02/2023 at 20:14:07\nSo basically more evidence that he is a skiver.\n345 Posted 06/02/2023 at 20:19:56\nIt could well be but judging by what he said last season about struggling with psychological issues, the problem may be related to that and Dyche is trying to give Dom some confidence.\n346 Posted 06/02/2023 at 20:30:17\nI personally love driving over the little brow on Boundary Street, and suddenly the ground comes into full view. It's really starting to take shape, but Brian W doesn't reckon it'll be complete in 18 months time. I wonder why, Brian?\n347 Posted 06/02/2023 at 20:35:08\nDoom and gloom, followed by a great result against Arsenal.\nInstead of being positive, they post negative comments to create more doom and gloom.\nPickford, contract on table not signed? That's been doing the rounds for I don't know how long! Nothing else to comment on, you won't sell many newspapers with fake news.\nDespite our situation over the last 18 months, Pickford is the England No 1 goalkeeper. Unless anybody knows differently, has he asked for a move or unhappy with his current situation? No!\n348 Posted 06/02/2023 at 23:40:38\nI think a lot depends on what Dom was wearing during the bleep tests, was it the traditional shorts, or a tighter-fitting Vivienne Westwood number? After all said and done, he does have 'previous'! :-)\n349 Posted 07/02/2023 at 07:23:00\n\"Other than a new station in Kirkby\"\nHas Bill not told them yet that we won't be moving there?\n350 Posted 07/02/2023 at 09:55:01\nYou are right though. Our income is modest to say the least. I think in terms of matchday income, we are 3rd bottom in the Premier League. I haven't looked it up recently, but it was the case a few months back...\nI spend a lot of money following Everton. Trains and sometimes planes. I'm not bragging or saying I'm better than any other supporter who travels with me, just leading into a point.\nWhen I go to Goodison, Everton get the price of a ticket (around 㿞), apart from when very kind friends look after me â€“ thank you, you know who you are. Maybe the occasional sausage roll when I can actually get served. Sorry, a thing with me, I must have one of those faces!\nFulham and Brentford get more out of me. Arsenal, Tottenham and West Ham certainly do.\nLiverpool won't. I promise. I learned that years ago during a very harsh lesson by a very strict Evertonian in the Anfield Road.\nMost of my matchday money is spent in the pubs and chippies around Goodison or in town before and after the match. It doesn't go to the club.\nBut for an often 𧶲 outlay (sometimes more if it's an overnighter), they only get about 㿞 of that. That's not a good return of investment.\nI think that's why it is imperative we put the life-belt and armbands on and swim (crawl?) to Bramley-Moore Dock. Hopefully the club has had the vision to provide facilities that keep the fans in the stadium and generate additional income.\nTottenham is a great example.\nI love Everton. I adore Goodison. But we have stood still for way too long.\nI just mentioned Everton and vision in the same sentence. Hopefully BMD is that vision.\nEveryone, you are going to have to excuse me. It's build-up to derby day and to make it worse, I was in \"discussion\" with two Kopites from Aintree yesterday afternoon. I held my own and put them in their place.\n351 Posted 07/02/2023 at 10:22:43\nI read on here somewhere that L'pool 4 is looking to run shuttle buses to thje ground to help the pubs, chippies and other businesses, to survive after we move,\nAs for Goodison Park, the club have plans (Plans?££) to build houses/ blocks of flats and a Garden of remembrance on the site.\n352 Posted 07/02/2023 at 10:38:52\n353 Posted 07/02/2023 at 10:55:07\nhttps://www.skyscrapercity.com/threads/everton-football-stadium-lw-bramley-moore-dock-capacity-52-888-%C2%A3760m-u-c.1724078/page-543#lg=attachment_xfUid-3-1675766867&slide=0\n354 Posted 07/02/2023 at 11:08:48\n355 Posted 07/02/2023 at 11:12:22\nMordor on Monday, but when we glance at that palace rising above the Mersey, we can look them in the eye and tell them who's city it is.\nGod, I don't even live there any more!!\nI think I need to take the advice and pace myself.\n356 Posted 07/02/2023 at 11:22:31\n357 Posted 07/02/2023 at 11:23:44\n358 Posted 07/02/2023 at 11:23:49\nI remember when Duncan Ferguson (so only very recent) got the Manager Job at Forest Green, so wanted to monitor his progress I noticed that the mighty FG Rovers have their own TV (?) Furthermore I have heard from our US Blues about not being able to get an Everton shirt easily, again poor marketing by the Club not the Fans fault !\nI go to a local Market most Thursdays in the Village of Frodsham, (excellent for most things) there is a guy there who sells Football related stuff mainly Towels and Scarves etc, I often look and have NEVER seen an Everton one there, but every other Premiership Club (within reason : no Bournemouth/Southampton etc) is there plus Barcelona, Real Madrid and the top Euro sides.\nWe are run by Dinosaurs who haven't a clue about the Commercial Opportunities that are out there, (well they probably do but can't be arsed).\nBe interesting to hear from our own Christine Foster or Derek Thomas (NZ and AUS) if the situation is similar down under with regards to Everton Merchandise.\n359 Posted 07/02/2023 at 11:26:32\nAnd you are spot on about our outward marketing.\n360 Posted 07/02/2023 at 11:37:20\nJust a bit further down the same road, is the Bellemont Hotel, a Samuel Smith's Pub which also has a decent view of the Mersey on a good day, but not as good as The Forest Hills one. Okay going down, but it is really steep to walk up Cardiac Hill, to quench one's thirst.\n361 Posted 07/02/2023 at 12:31:35\nCrowborough Hill near the â€˜White Hart on the Green'.\nBe nice to meet up for a pint ðŸ‘\n362 Posted 08/02/2023 at 16:51:34\nI know we've got a shop on Walton Lane and at the ground. But County Road is a major thoroughfare every day of the week! Maybe we can't afford to rent a shop!\n363 Posted 08/02/2023 at 17:00:15\n364 Posted 08/02/2023 at 17:58:03\nTony I'll ask Lyndon or Michael to give you my email address mate.
