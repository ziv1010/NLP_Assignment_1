  "body_text": "The Champions League games you need to watch in Gameweek 1\n- 18 Champions League games will be played this week\n- Arsenal and Liverpool will both be in action\n- Real Madrid and Man City are the favourites for the competition\nThe UEFA Champions League is back this week, and it's bigger than ever.\nWith the introduction of the new 'league' phase of the competition, fans of Europe's elite competition will be treated to more football than ever.\nThis week, 18 games will be played across three nights to kick things off.\nAnd while we'd love to watch every single one of these games, it's actually completely impossible.\nSo, with that in mind, we've decided to create a viewing guide for the next few days to help you pick which games to watch.\nYou're welcome.\nJuventus vs PSV Eindhoven\nWhen? Tuesday 17 September, 17:45 BST / 12:45 ET / 09:45 PT\nA team who hasn't conceded a goal all season versus one who has scored 20 in just five league games.\nThere's real 'unstoppable force vs immovable object' vibes about this clash between Juventus and PSV Eindhoven.\nLa Vecchia Signora head into the game with a new-look squad and a new manager in Thiago Motta at the helm, but their struggles in the final third - having fired blanks in their last two games - and their penchant for clean sheets - having kept four in four games - suggest that not too much has changed from the Max Allegri era quite yet.\nPSV, on the other hand, are playing like a team possessed in the Eredivisie. Their 20 goals in just five games have come thanks to 7-1 and 5-1 thumpings of Almere and RKC Waalwijk respectively.\nThis has all the makings of a Champions League classic.\nAC Milan vs Liverpool\nWhen? Tuesday 17 August, 20:00 BST / 15:00 ET / 12:00 PT\nWith 13 Champions League titles between them, it's fair to say that this is a heavyweight clash.\nAnd while AC Milan aren't close to the side that once dominated Europe, they still have a few players who can cause Liverpool problems at San Siro.\nThe Reds will need to be wary of the threat of the likes of Rafael Leao and former Premier League players Christian Pulisic, Tammy Abraham and Ruben Loftus-Cheek in order to bounce back from their shock defeat to Nottingham Forest at the weekend.\nBologna vs Shakhtar Donetsk\nWhen? Wednesday 18 September, 17:45 BST / 12:45 ET / 09:45 PT\nIf you fancy a break from the football, then Wednesday's 17:45 games are your chance.\nHowever, if you're hellbent on watching some football, then your best option is Bologna's first European game in over five decades.\nThe Serie A side will face off against Champions League stalwarts Shakhtar Donetsk at the Stadio Renato Dall'Ara on Wednesday evening, and will do so with a completely different team to the one which secured them a place in Europe's elite competition.\nBologna were raided during the summer transfer window, seeing their manager Thiago Motta up sticks for Juventus, and Riccardo Calafiori and Joshua Zirzkee move to the Premier League.\nThey'll be hoping that two-time Europa Conference League finalist and new manager Vincenzo Italiano will bring his European pedigree with him to the Renato Dall'Ara.\nManchester City vs Inter\nWhen? Wednesday 18 September, 20:00 BST / 15:00 ET / 12:00 PT\nA replay of the 2023 UEFA Champions League final during gameweek one? Maybe this new Champions League format isn't so bad after all.\nInter will be travelling to Manchester seeking for revenge after their final defeat in Istanbul, but don't expect them to get it while Erling Haaland is in the form that he's in.\nHaving scored nine goals in just four league games, the Norway international looks pretty unstoppable right now.\nFeyenoord vs Bayer Leverkusen\nWhen? Thursday 19 September, 17:45 BST / 12:45 ET / 09:45 PT\nYes, Thursday night UEFA Champions League football. It's a strange world we live in.\nWe're being treated to some pretty damn enticing games on Thursday too.\nThe first of which is Bayer Leverkusen's first Champions League game under Xabi Alonso - a jarring thought considering how brilliant they've been since he took charge.\nAfter their remarkable unbeaten domestic double and Europa League final appearance in 2023/24, Alonso's Leverkusen will now be hoping to make their make in Europe's elite competition, and we wouldn't be against them doing so.\nTheir first opponents will be Feyenoord, previously managed by Arne Slot, and keen to right the wrongs of their early season form - they've won just one of their four Eredivisie games thus far.\nAtalanta vs Arsenal\nWhen? Thursday 19 September, 20:00 BST / 15:00 ET / 12:00 PT)\nDespite an early season injury crisis, Arsenal will head into their first Champions League game of the season on a massive high having beaten north London derby rivals Tottenham on Sunday.\nThe Gunners are set to face off against Europa League winners Atalanta in Bergamo, and having watched the Serie A side put Liverpool to the sword last season, theyll be well aware of the threat they pose.",
