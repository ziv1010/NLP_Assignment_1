  "body_text": "Arne Slot has revealed Alexander Isak suffered a groin injury in Liverpool’s Champions League victory over Eintracht Frankfurt.\nLiverpool’s club-record signing started in Germany but did not come back out with his team-mates at the half-time interval.\nThe Premier League champions were already 3-1 up by that stage and fans were wondering if Slot had removed Isak for tactical reasons following another subdued performance from the ex-Newcastle United striker.\nBut Slot confirmed in his post-match press conference that Isak’s withdrawal was out of necessity due to a groin problem that could rule him out of Saturday’s Premier League clash with Brentford.\n‘Unfortunately Alex didn’t score before he had to go off at half-time because he felt his groin a little bit,’ Slot said following the emphatic 5-1 win.\n‘So that’s a pity. It’s such a difficult balance to find for a player who was out for three months.\n‘You bring him in slowly but people argue you need to play them more or for longer and now we’ve played him for the second time in three days and unfortunately he had to go off so let’s hope for the best.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘It’s not an easy balance to find when a player has been out for so long.’\nLiverpool travelled to Germany on the back off four straight defeats but outclassed Eintracht Frankfurt, who have been involved in three successive 5-1 scorelines in the Champions League.\nRasmus Kristensen gave the hosts the lead midway through the first half but Liverpool still led 3-1 at half-time thanks to goals from Hugo Ekitike, Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate.\nCody Gakpo added Liverpool’s fourth from Florian Wirtz’s first assist for the Reds before Dominik Szoboszlai capped a dominant performance with a fifth.\n‘I don’t know if it’s a statement but it is a win and something to build on,’ Anfield captain Van Dijk said.\n‘I’ve been in the football business for a while, so not relief. Obviously we are disappointed with losing games, so it’s something we have to deal with, stick together and keep working.\n‘Today we won and have to be ready for Brentford on Saturday. We don’t get dragged into the negative things that are going around.\n‘The only way you can play your game is to focus on the task ahead. Keep going, don’t get dragged into all that stuff.’\nIsak’s injury is the latest blow to a player who is yet to catch fire since his record-breaking summer move to Liverpool.\nThe Sweden international has only scored one goal in his first ten appearances for Liverpool and that came in the Carabao Cup against Championship side Southampton.\nWhile Isak is struggling, fellow summer signing Ekitike has been one of Liverpool’s most important players since his move from Frankfurt.\n‘It was a great feeling [to come back to Frankfurt],’ said Ekitike, who refused to celebrate scoring against his former club.\nMore Trending\n‘It was something special to come back home. To win and score my first Champions League goal here was important.’\nOn his partnership with Isak, Ekitike added: ‘I think it was good. We can improve together and he is a very good player, we need to work together and find a good association.’\nSlot has another injury concern to deal with as fellow summer signing Jeremie Frimpong hobbled off against Frankfurt.\n‘I expect Frimpong to be out for a few weeks with this new injury,’ said Slot, who is bidding to retain the Premier League trophy.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Mohamed Salah deletes Liverpool references after Champions League win\nMORE: Liverpool boss Arne Slot responds to criticism over Man Utd comments\nMORE: £27m Arsenal star hailed as ‘one of the best in the world’ after Atletico Madrid win",
