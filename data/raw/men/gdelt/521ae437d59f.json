While the club continues negotiations with Brentford over Bryan Mbeumo, reports from Sky Sports confirm that the Red Devils are still firmly in the market for a No 9.\nDespite having already secured Matheus Cunha from Wolves, United are exploring other attacking options to complement or perhaps even compete with the Brazilian. Viktor Gyokeres is one such name on their radar. The Sporting Lisbon striker, who thrived under Amorim in Portugal, is reportedly admired by the new United boss, and that existing relationship could prove pivotal in United’s pursuit.\n“Gyokeres is one of a number of forwards United are looking at,” Sky Sports News reports, highlighting that while no formal approach has been made, the Swedish international remains a viable target. Portuguese outlets suggest Gyokeres would prefer a move to a Champions League club, which puts United in a potentially favourable position given their likely qualification for Europe’s premier competition.\nAmorim’s admiration is not merely sentimental. The striker’s physical style, relentless work rate and tactical flexibility make him a suitable candidate for the high-pressing, possession-based football United are expected to play under Amorim.\nMbeumo negotiations ongoing\nWhile Viktor Gyokeres is being monitored, United remain in talks with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo.\n“Talks continue between Manchester United and Brentford over the signing of Bryan Mbeumo,” Sky Sports confirms. United’s opening offer, reportedly worth up to £55 million, was rejected. Nonetheless, there appears to be a mutual interest in making the move happen.\nUnited’s approach this summer will be defined by financial discipline. “They have a price in mind for all the players they are interested in and will not overpay,” the report notes. Club officials are willing to walk away if the terms do not align with their valuation, yet they are reportedly “impressed with Mbeumo’s strong desire to join the club.”\nThat eagerness could be the deciding factor. Mbeumo, known for his versatility and efficiency in front of goal, fits the mould of a modern forward who can operate across several positions. Should the deal go through, he would offer Amorim further depth and tactical options.\nDepartures set to shape final transfer strategy\nAmid new arrivals, several high-profile departures are anticipated. Offers are expected for Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.\nWhether those players are sold or loaned will have significant implications for who else United can bring in. Antony and Rashford already left on loan in January, and further exits would free up both squad space and wages, allowing for new additions like Gyokeres or Mbeumo to be accommodated.\nCrucially, Sky Sports also mentions that “United will be disciplined this summer with all their transfer activity.” This level-headed approach stands in stark contrast to previous windows where the club was accused of scattergun recruitment.\nFinancial footing remains secure\nEncouragingly for United fans, the club’s financial results suggest compliance with all relevant regulations. “The club remains committed to, and in compliance with, both the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules and UEFA’s Financial Fair Play Regulations,” a statement confirmed.\nIncreased revenue from their Europa League campaign and cost reductions have given the club greater flexibility. “United’s revenue increased by 17.4 per cent to £160.5m, while wages across the business decreased by £20m,” according to the quarterly update.\nWith financial stability assured, United are better positioned to execute Amorim’s rebuild in a controlled yet effective manner.\nOur View – EPL Index Analysis\nFrom a Manchester United fan perspective, this news signals cautious optimism. The days of wild spending and desperate bids seem to be behind us. The interest in Viktor Gyokeres makes total sense. He has all the attributes United have lacked up top in recent years – strength, smart movement and, crucially, the finishing ability we’ve often missed.\nMbeumo is a more subtle but equally exciting target. He won’t dominate headlines like a Harry Kane or an Osimhen might, but his tactical intelligence and flexibility would suit the Premier League and Amorim’s system perfectly. The fact he is pushing for the move also shows we are becoming a more attractive destination again.\nWhat’s particularly reassuring is the club’s firm stance on valuations. Too often in the past we’ve been overcharged. Now, with financial discipline and a clear footballing philosophy, fans can hope for smart, sustainable signings. If Mbeumo and Gyokeres both arrive, along with Cunha, this could be United’s most balanced and coherent forward line in a decade.\nThere’s still a long way to go, and plenty depends on outgoings, but the early signs suggest Amorim’s United might finally be moving with purpose.",
