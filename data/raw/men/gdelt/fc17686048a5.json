We are not looking down upon ourselves and we are determined.”\nAssistant coach Peter ‘Shoes’ Mgangira also said they fancy their chances of going far in the competition.\n“We know we will be up against the continent’s best, but we are determined to get something from this campaign. We have told the boys not to look down upon themselves,” he said.\nOn the other hand, Wanderers president and board chairperson Dr Thomson Mpinganjira set qualification for the group stages as a target which could fetch the Nomads a minimum of $400 000 (about K705 million).\nWanderers coach Bob Mpinganjira said the target is achievable.\nHe said: “It is the president’s wish that we should go far in this\ntournament and it is possible.\n“Most of our players have played at international level and, therefore, they are not venturing into unchartered territory. What we need to do is just prepare well and urge the players to give out something extra.”\nIn the Champions League, the losing semi-finalists will get $1.2 million (about K1.2 billion) while in the Confederation Cup, they will get $750 000 (about K1.3 billion).\nThe two teams are also set to receive $100 000 (about K175 million) subvention each from the continental football governing body.\nBut Wanderers chief executive officer Panganeni Ndovi said they will only get the funds from CAF after the tournament.\nFootball Association of Malawi (FAM) competitions and communications director Gomezgani Zakazaka said the money “is sent either during or after the tournament, but they are assured of getting it anyway”.\nMeanwhile, FAM has said both Wanderers and Silver have paid for match officials’ travel and accommodation expenses for their preliminary round home games.\nAccording to CAF rules and regulations, home teams are supposed to meet travel and accommodation expenses for the referee, assistant referees, fourth official, match commissioner and match assessor.",
