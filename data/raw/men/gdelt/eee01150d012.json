  "body_text": "Liverpool stance on Arne Slot sack revealed as situation gets 'dangerous'\nArne Slot does not appear to be in any imminent danger of being sacked by Liverpool as things stand.\nThe Reds have endured a disastrous start to their Premier League title defence, hitting a new low with Saturday’s abject 3-0 loss against Nottingham Forest at Anfield.\nLiverpool delivered a dismal display in their first match back following the November international break despite the return of first-choice goalkeeper Alisson, with Murillo, Nicola Savona and Morgan Gibbs-White all on target for Sean Dyche’s resurgent visitors on Merseyside.\nIt could have been even worse too, were it not for Igor Jesus’ goal being ruled out for handball in the first half as improving Forest moved up to 16th and a point clear of the relegation zone.\nLiverpool, meanwhile, sit in the bottom half of the table after 12 matches for the first time in a decade, slumped down in 11th place after losing six of their last seven top-flight games.\nThey are already 11 points behind dominant leaders Arsenal and three adrift of the top four in a tightly-contested pack, with a trip to West Ham coming up next weekend after Wednesday’s visit of PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.\nLiverpool’s abysmal run of domestic form has led to inevitable questions being asked of Slot’s future, just six months after he lifted he Premier League title at Anfield following a dream debut campaign in charge as Jurgen Klopp’s successor.\nA huge summer transfer spend of around £450million has yet to yield results, with many of the headline new arrivals - including Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz - struggling to impress.\nHowever, it seems that Slot is not in danger of losing his job yet, with Fabrizio Romano insisting that no managerial change is being considered at this time by Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group (FSG).\n“At the moment, I don’t have any sort of information on Liverpool’s owners deciding to take a decision imminently, I mean now, today, tomorrow, on Arne Slot,” Romano said on his YouTube channel on Sunday.\n“Liverpool are not thinking about changing the manager now. Obviously the owners, the club, want to see a different kind of result, different kind of performances.\n“They expect much more, by Arne Slot and by this team. For sure, Liverpool want to see something different from the manager and the players, because this is not only Arne Slot. The players also have to take responsibility, as Virgil van Dijk said.\n“It’s the players and the coach. Obviously Arne Slot knows the situation is dangerous and complicated now, but at the same time Arne Slot can feel the backing and the support from the club.\n“Liverpool are not in talks with any other manager, [or] considering the possibility to fire the coach. That is the situation as of today. Of course results have to change imminently, especially in the Premier League.”\nThe Times also report that Slot retains the backing of the Liverpool hierarchy, while the Daily Mail say that he has credit in the bank still.\nAccording to the Mail, Slot pulled out of attending the Northern Football Writers' awards ceremony on Sunday evening following the defeat by Forest, with club ambassador Gary McAllister reportedly instead sent to collect the manager of the season award for 2024/25 on his behalf.",
