UEFA has done a great job of raising the profile of Europe's second most prestigious competition and making it a more absorbing competition for football fans. As well as offering clubs the opportunity to win major silverware, it also now provides an automatic route into next season’s Champions League campaign.\nGetting your hands on Premier League (and other high-profile European leagues) match tickets can prove to be a tough ask these days, so the Europa League also offers fans further opportunities to see their beloved sides in action.\nThe UEFA Europa League has also provided a platform for emerging teams to gain European exposure and for smaller clubs to achieve prestigious international victories. The 2025/26 edition is no exception, with the competition bringing together diverse teams from across the continent in what promises to be another epic season.\nWhat is the UEFA Europa League 2025/26 schedule?\nThe qualifying rounds for this season’s Europa League kicked off way back in mid-June. So the complete competition lasts almost twelve months, with the final taking place at the Besiktas Stadium in Istanbul in May. This is the remaining round dates:\n- Jan 22: League Phase (Matchday 7)\n- Jan 29: League Phase (Matchday 8)\n- February 19: Knockout phase play-offs (1st leg)\n- February 26: Knockout phase play-offs (2nd leg)\n- March 12: Round of 16 (1st leg)\n- March 19: Round of 16 (2nd leg)\n- April 9: Quarter-finals (1st leg)\n- April 16: Quarter-finals (2nd leg)\n- April 30: Semi-finals (1st leg)\n- May 7: Semi-finals (2nd leg)\n- May 20: Final\nHow to buy UEFA Europa League match tickets\nAside from the UEFA Europa League final, you cannot buy tickets for Europa League matches directly through UEFA itself. Instead, they are sold club-by-club among the teams competing in the current edition. You must visit the individual club sites for the fixture you want to attend and buy your seat from there. In some cases, you will need to sign up as a club member to be able to secure your tickets.\nDemand often exceeds available allocation, so in addition, fans can purchase Europa League tickets on the secondary market on platforms like StubHub.\nHow much are UEFA Europa League match tickets?\nThe price for UEFA Europa League tickets can vary due to multiple factors, including the round of the fixture, the clubs involved, and where the match is played.\nFor example, a quarter-final that features Aston Villa at Villa Park is likely to be priced higher than a league phase game at Go Ahead Eagles’ home ground of ‘De Adelaarshorst’.\nPrices for UEFA Europa League tickets are typically set by clubs at the start of a European campaign, ahead of the first matches. Depending on how far a team progresses and who their opponents are, prices may increase for future fixtures.\nKeep tabs on the various clubs’ official ticket portals for additional information about availability and prices. Europa League match tickets on secondary resale sites such as StubHub are currently available from €34 upwards.",
