We don't have to be perfect.\n\"When we educate our kids, they (think they) have to be perfect for Instagram and TikToks, and this kind of thing, they have to be a genius.\n\"But I would say the uncertainty, things that happen before a game, happen. When I feel that feeling I know it's normal. The problem would be if I didn't have that feeling.\"\nThe bookmakers now make City favourites to not only defend their title, but go on to match Manchester United's feat in 1998/99 as the only English side to win the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup in the same season.\nHowever, Guardiola warned he expects a reaction from Arsenal after seeing their lead chipped away in recent weeks by draws with Liverpool, West Ham and bottom-of-the-table Southampton.\n\"Always I had the feeling that it would be so difficult to play them at this stage but, after three games dropping points, it will be much, much more difficult now,\" added Guardiola.\n\"I would have preferred it if they had come here with better results than the three last results when they didn't win a game.\"\nBoth sides will be missing key defenders as City are without Nathan Ake, while William Saliba's continued absence poses a headache for Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta.\nWithout the Frenchman, Arsenal have conceded seven goals in their last three games and must find a way of keeping City's 48-goal marksman Erling Haaland quiet.\nBut Arteta has encouraged his young side to embrace the \"incredible\" opportunity they have to shock the football world by bouncing back at the Etihad to keep the destiny of the title in their own hands with five games to go.\n\"It is going to be a tough night and challenge, yes, but the opportunity is incredible for us,\" said the Spaniard.\n\"You want to be champion, you have to win these matches, it is as simple as that.\"\n© 2023 AFP",
