That’s what we’ve earned the right to do. We’ll try to enjoy that.\n“We will try to win both legs. It’s not in our handbook to leave things to chance. It will be a wonderful spectacle for everyone who loves football.”\nPSG were dominant in a 2-0 win over Dortmund at home to open their Champions League campaign but were held to a 1-1 draw in the return leg.\nDortmund have gone 10 games unbeaten at home in the Champions League in their 80,000-seat-strong Westfalenstadion fortress.\nPSG were crowned Ligue 1 champions on Sunday, their 10th league title in the past 12 seasons.\nThe domestic dominance has however not been translated into European silverware. PSG lost the final in 2020 to Bayern Munich.\n“When you come to stadiums like this one it’s a pleasure. You have to enjoy where you are and where you are as footballers as well,” continued the former Spain coach.\n“We’ll experience it all on Wednesday (today). We are ready and prepared to play two great games and want to win both of them.”\nTold his side were considered strong favourites by the media, the 53-year-old said: “That shows the press doesn’t know much about football.”",
