  "body_text": "\" \"In an open, good conversation we came to the decision to mutually end our collaboration in the summer.Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen\nOur goal is to carry out a sporting realignment with a new coach for the 2024/25 season. Until then, every individual in the club is expressly challenged to achieve the maximum possible in the Champions League and the Bundesliga.\"\"\nThomas Tuchel and Bayern Munchen have confirmed that they will end their collaboration as soon as the 23/24 season ends. And the German Head Coach is reportedly interested in returning to the Premier League where he was named The Best FIFA Football Coach in 2021, after he pulled a rabbit out of the hat with Chelsea in the UEFA Champions League.\nAs Jason Cundy says, \"It would be Box Office\" however Tuchel was apparently sacked due to some disagreements with the owners. But the Chels' faithful firmly believe that the tactician should be considered as a leading candidate to take CFC back to where they belong.\nReports on the other hand suggest that the 50 year old looks at Manchester United as his 'dream job' and is also being considered by West Ham as he would be open to coming back to London.\nPochettino on the other hand has only been asking for time as he is confident that he will turn things around eventually.\n\"“Always it is about time. The problem is that we need time and patience to win games, and we need the patience from the owners to have the possibility to keep going...”.\"Mauricio Pochhetino\nThis tweet explains Pochettino's work and current situation perfectly. Majority of the CFC supporters pay no heed to the fact that every manager came to naught over the last 5-6 seasons when it came to 'chance creation' and that includes Thomas Tuchel.\nUnder the Argentine, irrespective of the countless injuries suffered by our core, the side stands second when it comes to 'Big Chances Created' in the Premier League which is extremely unusual for a team that is struggling to stay in the top half of the points table.\nWhy is this team on the skids?\nIt's not rocket science, it's clear as day that Inexperience is the issue. There's no denying the fact that the boys work hard in training every week, but all their hard work goes down the drain due to their decision making in the final third. The Blues have almost completed a half century of chances missed, managing to convert a fraction of those opportunities would've positioned us in the top 4 easily.\nWhat should the owners do?\nStick with Pochettino.\nThe fans cannot be blamed as they're used to the revolving door strategy used by Mr. Abramovich. But the Boehly-Clearlake ownership have got history with building a long term relationship as they did with their baseball team, Los Angeles Dodgers, whose Head coach Dave Roberts has been leading the team for almost 10 years.\nWe did fail as a club when it comes to recruitments, failing to add experience to this potent side. But not getting behind a tactician who is known for helping young players realize their potential in the Premier League itself will leave us dead in the water.\n\"\"We feel disappointed. Of course. It's Chelsea and so it's about winning\".Mauricio Pochettino\n\"Liverpool spent four years, Klopp didn't win a title but had the support of the club to keep going. Look, now they are getting what they deserve...\".\n\"Chelsea it is completely different because of the pressure of that [£1billion spent on the squad]. For me, it is unfair, but in saying that, I accept the opinions.”\"\nAnd it's not that we're not seeing progress. We need to accept the fact that the glory days are gone but not forever. This Chelsea team displays glimpses of their potential time and again, and if awarded time they will get together and achieve great things.\nWe're already seeing what Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp have managed to harbour with time and persistence. And for those suggesting that Pochettino should still be axed have short memories of Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson, who was nearly sacked in his first or second season? The rest is history.",
