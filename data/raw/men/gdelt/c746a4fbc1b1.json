Somebody said he’s a superstar, so somebody has got to pay superstar money.\n“Realistically, homegrown, 24 years old, sensational talent, somebody has to make it difficult for us. At the moment it isn’t. He’ll still be at Crystal Palace at the moment, but it’s not impossible.”\nVictor Osimhen\nSince joining Napoli from Lille in the summer of 2020, Osimhen has won a Serie A title and scored 76 goals in 133 appearances in all competitions.\nAntonio Conte’s side are now willing to let the striker leave for the right price after agreeing a deal to sign Romelu Lukaku from Chelsea.\nHe recently rejected an offer from Saudi Pro League side Al-Ahli, with his agent saying the 25-year-old still has “much to do in Europe.”\nChelsea, Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain all hold a long-standing interest in the Nigeria international and could submit an offer before the deadline.\nRaheem Sterling\nChelsea are looking to trim their squad before the transfer deadline and Sterling has been deemed surplus to requirements by Enzo Maresca.\n“I am not saying Raheem is not a good player, but I prefer different kinds of wingers,” the Chelsea manager said.\n“We have a big squad and it’s impossible to give all of them minutes. If they are looking for minutes it’s better for them to leave. I try to be honest.”\nAccording to reports, Chelsea are exploring a deal which would see Sterling join Manchester United and Jadon Sancho move in the opposite direction.\nDespite his history with Liverpool and Manchester City, sources have told TEAMtalk that the 29-year-old would be open to a move to Old Trafford.\nRaheem on target! 🤝#CheLut pic.twitter.com/XCwShw6WjV\n— Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) August 25, 2023\nBen Chilwell\nAlongside Sterling, Chilwell has also been told that he doesn’t feature in Maresca’s plans at Stamford Bridge.\nThe 27-year-old hasn’t been included in any matchday squads for Chelsea this season and will look to leave the club in search of regular first-team football.\nHe has reportedly been offered to Manchester United, who are in the market for a left-back due to Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia’s injury history.\nAaron Ramsdale\nRamsdale fell out of favour at Arsenal in the 2023/24 season, with David Raya taking over as Mikel Arteta’s first-choice goalkeeper.\n“No footballer wants to not play, I’ve had a tough year personally not playing and I never want to do that again,” the goalkeeper said. “It was tough.”\nArsenal have rejected loan offers from both Ajax and Wolves as they are looking to sell the England international this summer, although they may accept a loan-to-buy obligation deal.\nFederico Chiesa\nJuventus are looking to sell Chiesa before the end of the summer transfer window in order to avoid losing him on a free transfer in 2025.\nHe has reportedly agreed personal terms with Barcelona, but the La Liga side need to free up their finances in order to register him in Hansi Flick’s squad.\nLiverpool have now joined the race for his signature and may be able to sign the Italy international for as little as £12.5million.\nIvan Toney\nToney has less than 12 months left on his Brentford contract and has been left out of their two first Premier League games in 2024/25.\nThe striker has been linked with Chelsea, Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United but they have all pursued other targets this summer.\nAl-Ahli are interested in the 28-year-old and saw their opening £35million bid rejected by Brentford, who are holding out for nearer £50million.\n“He could be here after the 30 [August] and he could not be here,” manager Thomas Frank said. “Basically everything is up in the air. I’ve said the whole time that if he’s here I’m very happy, if he’s not here then I’m happy on his behalf.”\nMr Composed 🥶\nJust three minutes of Ivan Toney scoring penalties in the @premierleague 🦁 pic.twitter.com/AIcuDPTRAD\n— Brentford FC (@BrentfordFC) June 10, 2024\nKingsley Coman\nComan has enjoyed a trophy-laden career at Bayern Munich, winning eight Bundesliga titles, three DFB-Pokal trophies, the Champions League and the FIFA World Club Cup.\nAccording to reports in France, the 28-year-old is now looking for a fresh challenge and is expected to leave the Bundesliga outfit before the end of the transfer window.\nHe currently has a lucrative offer from Al-Ahli on the table, but Barcelona and a number of Premier League clubs are also monitoring his situation.\nBayern are reportedly willing to let the France international leave on an initial loan deal as they look to get his wages off the books.\nAnthony Gordon\nGordon looked set to complete a £75million move to Liverpool earlier in the summer, only for Newcastle United to pull the plug on the deal at the eleventh hour.\nThe Reds remain interested in the 23-year-old England international and Newcastle manager Eddie Howe has refused to rule out a late departure.\n“I have been in the game too long to make those statements,” he said when asked if Gordon will still be at St James’ Park when the window shuts.\n“What I will say is from my part and the club’s part we will do everything we can to keep our best players but I am not a fortune teller.”\nREAD MORE: When does the summer 2024 transfer window close?
