  "body_text": "Manchester United have officially confirmed Tyrell Malacia has joined PSV Eindhoven on loan until the remainder of the season.\nThe 25-year-old defender is returning to Holland having been signed by the Red Devils from Feyenoord in 2022 for £16 million.\nMalacia enjoyed an “accomplished debut season” in English football as he helped United to a 3rd place finish in the Premier League and a Carabao Cup victory over Newcastle.\nHowever, the left-back was ruled out for the entirety of the following campaign, and the beginning of this season, with a serious knee injury which required two surgeries.\nSince returning to the first-team action under Ruben Amorim, Malacia has featured eight times in a Reds shirt.\nThe Dutch defender has not gained the full trust of his Portuguese manager, however, in Amorim’s 3-4-3 system which utilises two wing-backs.\nMalacia lacks the technical ability to offer a consistent attacking threat in the opposition half, while his long-term absence through injury appears to have impacted his speed, though this will likely improve as the 25-year-old gets more minutes under his belt.\nHeading into the January transfer window, a new left wing-back was considered “critical” amongst Old Trafford’s hierarchy with the club eventually agreeing a deal worth a potential £30 million for Lecce’s Patrick Dorgu.\nThis addition has further reduced Malacia’s role in Amorim’s squad and United began searching for a loan opportunity for the Dutch international.\nA move to Benfica appeared on the verge of completion only for the Red Devils to end negotiations after the Portuguese side tabled a hardball offer to seal the deal. Instead, United quickly changed tac and a return to Holland was agreed in the final hours of the winter window.\nPSV are currently atop the Eredivisie by two points, as well as facing Juventus in the Champions League play-offs. This offers Malacia a perfect platform to re-establish himself at the highest level in a familiar environment where has has previously thrived.\n“Everybody at United wishes Tyrell well for the rest of the season,” the club’s website concludes in its update confirming Malacia had swapped Manchester for Eindhoven.\nFeatured image Justin Setterfield via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
