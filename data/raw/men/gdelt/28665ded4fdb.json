Never miss a kick-off!\nJoin the club\nGet full access to premium articles, exclusive features and a growing list of member rewards.\nThe Manchester United squad is, once again, at a crossroads.\nIt's beginning to feel like every year that the Red Devils are ready to rip up the plan and start all over again – but with Sir Jim Ratcliffe now a year into his tenure as minority shareholder and Ruben Amorim needing sweeping changes to his options on the pitch, we're here once more.\nWith plenty of deadwood among the gems at Old Trafford, however, who's most likely for the cut? Our FourFourTwo experts have taken the team to task to figure who'll be kept and sold come summer…\nGoalkeepers\nAltay Bayindir\nAge: 27\nWage, as per Capology: £35,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2027\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €10.00m\nA steady backup goalkeeper this season, Altay Bayindir impressed in the FA Cup away at Arsenal, rather unfortunately lost his place once more to Andre Onana and then was reinstated, following the Cameroonian's blunders in the Europe League.\nIt seems probable that only one of them will remain next season, given Amorim's concerns over Onana – but here's where it gets interesting.\nBayindir is a much easier prospect to sell. Just 27, with low wages and a contract lasting just two more years, there are surely plenty of European clubs who would be willing to take a chance on him – plenty more than Onana.\nThere's a good keeper in there with a lot less baggage than United's no.1: if only he hadn't have been signed from Fenerbahce, we'd tip him to succeed Fernando Muslera at Galatasaray.\nFourFourTwo verdict: To be sold (dependent on Onana).\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nAndre Onana\nAge: 29\nWage, as per Capology: £120,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2028\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €32.00m\nTime's surely up for the erratic former Ajax and Inter Milan stopper as Manchester United's no.1.\nOnana has shown some solid form in spells but the mistakes are just too high-profile at this point – especially after comments from Nemanja Matic about the 29-year-old being United's worst keeper ever last week.\nHaving joined United just two years ago for £47m, as per the BBC, the club won't want to make too much of a loss – and his six-figure wages could complicate things, meaning that this could become a protracted saga unless the Saudi Pro League offer an olive branch.\nA loan move could work, otherwise, United look likely to retain Onana another season.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Staying to fight for his spot with a new signing (unless an offer comes in).\nTom Heaton\nAge: 38\nWage, as per Capology: £45,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2025\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €0.25m\nAs a third-choice keeper, former United academy graduate Tom Heaton offers plenty.\nHe has bags of experience, he's great for mentoring some of the younger players and let's not forget he was an excellent keeper in his youth: there are certainly worse to call upon in a crisis.\nThe cons are obvious, though. Having failed to make a league start in the past three seasons,, Heaton is someone whose wage comes into question under Ratcliffe's cost-cutting initiatives.\nIf Heaton really is on £45,000 a week as reported, it seems a no-brainer to bank that at the end of his contract this summer. If the veteran is prepared to sit on the bench for less – a lot less – then perhaps he'll continue at Old Trafford.\nFourFourTwo verdict: An obvious place to cut funds, it looks like Heaton could leave United (again) this summer.\nCentre-backs\nAyden Heaven\nAge: 18\nWage, as per Capology: £4,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2029\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €1.50m\nPeople knock the recruitment at United but this is rare example of good business from the Red Devils in the past year.\nAyden Heaven joined in January and though he's out injured right now, could offer serious value in depth in the long-term – especially considering United play with a back three.\nThe centre-back was shown a clear path into United's side and impressed there: he's on a low wage, a long contract and now, the goal is to develop further and provide cover when necessary.\nExpect more signings like this in the summer.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Staying.\nHarry Maguire\nAge: 32\nWage, as per Capology: £190,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2026\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €15.00m\nIn January, Ruben Amorim confirmed that Harry Maguire had triggered a one-year contract extension to remain at Manchester United until 2026.\nIt makes perfect sense: Maguire – who held the record for being the most expensive English player of all time when he signed for the club – has enjoyed a renaissance in the centre of Amorim's three-man backline and is one of few leaders on the pitch.\nEven if Amorim were to decide he wants a direct replacement for the England international, it's incredibly unlikely that anyone offers a 32-year-old an improvement on his £190,000-a-week deal – so expect to see Maguire leave at the end of his contract next summer.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Staying.\nJonny Evans\nAge: 37\nWage, as per Capology: £65,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2025\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €1.50m\nJonny Evans perhaps expected to play a handful of games and to do some coaching badges when he re-joined United last summer.\nInstead, he became an integral pillar for Erik ten Hag when all was collapsing around the club, remaining on for another year to bridge the gap under the INEOS ownership.\nHaving featured a lot less this term – probably how he likes it – Evans likely won't get another year extension, with the 37-year-old almost certainly ready to depart on a free transfer, perhaps retiring after a long and distinguished career. He's earned it for last season alone.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Leaving on a free.\nLeny Yoro\nAge: 19\nWage, as per Capology: £115,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2029\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €55.00m\nInjuries have troubled Leny Yoro this season, but when he's played, he's been steady and performed well beyond his tender years.\nUnited perhaps overpaid to secure the Frenchman ahead of the likes of Real Madrid – not that anyone's complaining now – and with a season under his belt, he'll be one of the first names on the team-sheet next term if he can remain fit.\nUnited desperately need his recovery pace at the back and ability on the ball in buildup: he'll become an important part of the defence in the short- and long-term.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Staying.\nLisandro Martinez\nAge: 27\nWage, as per Capology: £120,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2027\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €45.00m\nOne of United's most important players, it goes without saying that he won't be sold – for two reasons.\nLisandro Martinez suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in February and is expected to be recovering until at least October, leaving United a little short on the left sie of their back three.\nGiven the numbers that Amorim has at his disposal, it's unlikely he'll dip into the market for a replacement – with far more pressing concerns elsewhere. United will be hoping that the World Cup winner can provide a boost in the second half of next season, however, to help the side push on in the run-in.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Staying.\nMatthijs De Ligt\nAge: 25\nWage, as per Capology: £195,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2029\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €40.00m\nHe's done absolutely fine this season: nothing spectacular, nothing awful.\nIt's just as well, really, because Matthijs De Ligt is on heavy wages and is under contract until 2029. United were banking on this one coming off – and luckily it has.\nThe Dutchman is fairly reliable, offers leadership across the back three and will likely be leant on next season once more. A success in the market from last season – even if he was a little pricey.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Staying.\nNoussair Mazraoui\nAge: 27\nWage, as per Capology: £135,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2028\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €32.00m\nOne of the signings of the Premier League season, Noussair Mazraoui has been a certified hit at Old Trafford.\nThe Moroccan has proven this season that he's able to play either as a wide centre-back or a wing-back, making him invaluable to Amorim's set-up going forward – and with solid performances, he's one to rely on as this team devevlops.\nThe only slight concern for Mazraoui is that Amorim may only view Amorim as a squad player when he has everyone fit and brings in a few more players that he likes. The Portuguese clearly wants options at wing-back and with Mazraoui not a natural centre-back, he might find himself behind Yoro and Martinez in the pecking order.\nGiven his wage and the fact that United have tied him down during peak years though, that's not a major problem at all – and the club will be looking for more opportunities like Mazraoui come summer.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Staying.\nVictor Lindelof\nAge: 30\nWage, as per Capology: £120,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2025\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €10.00m\nIf it seems like Victor Lindelof has been at Manchester United a while, that's because he was signed by Jose Mourinho and struggled for game time initially behind Chris Smalling and Phil Jones.\nThe Swede is just two years off from testimonial territory but barring a massive change in opinion from Amorim, he'll cut his United career short at just the eight years and nearly 200 league appearances.\nNot bad for someone who's never been first-choice – but United can no longer justify the £120,000-a-week wages that have probably ruined any chance of the Red Devils moving him on in the past near-decade.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Leaving on a free transfer.\nWing-backs\nDiogo Dalot\nAge: 26\nWage, as per Capology: £85,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2028\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €35.00m\nDiogo Dalot is another who's had a bizarre United career: thought to be the next big thing and sent on loan before settling and becoming a fan favourite simply for being consistent and underrated among the masses.\nGiven his five-figure wages and decent value, there's always a chance that Dalot might interest a European giant who want a versatile full-back who doesn't put a foot wrong – a Barcelona, Bayern Munich, even Newcastle United, in the event of Kieran Trippier leaving.\nAnd Manchester United would likely consider it: they need the money and with Amorim perhaps favouring Amad Diallo and Patrick Dorgu as his first-choice pairing at wing-back, cashing in on Dalot would be unfortunate but sensible.\nStill, there's no point seeking such a sale when Dalot has been so reliable in a squad where very few players have been. He'll stay this summer barring a massive opportunity.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Staying – unless a move comes in too good to refuse.\nHarry Amass\nAge: 18\nWage, as per Capology: £5,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2027\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: —\nHarry Amass made his full debut at the weekend and is highly thought of by United as one for the future.\nHis ability at left wing-back may well be a godsend for Amorim, who can use the teenager for cover behind Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot – and with Luke Shaw's fitness so unreliable, Amass may feature much more next term.\nA loan could be a good move for.the youngster but with United's injury problems, he'll likely get first-team oopportunities where he is.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Staying – unless a good loan presents itself.\nLuke Shaw\nAge: 29\nWage, as per Capology: £150,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2027\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €16.00m\nSome United fans may not even notice if Luke Shaw leaves Manchester United after 11 years at the club.\nThat's the cruel truth of a player who has played just 15 times in the past two seasons – and though he'd be absolutely perfect on the left-hand side of Amorim's back three, the manager just can't trust Shaw to be available for the role.\nWith the left-back turning 30 this summer, a crunch decision presents itself. Does he want a new challenge and a much-needed fresh start? Or is he happy seeing out the last two years of his contract, likely on the bench?\nFourFourTwo verdict: Could go either way: FourFourTwo just wants to see him play at this point.\nPatrick Dorgu\nAge: 20\nWage, as per Capology: £40,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2030\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €25.00m\nPatrick Dorgu has been steady since arriving in January, with more expected of him next season, for sure.\nThe Dane is still incredibly young though, so while Amorim won't have a problem leaning on him in the left wing-back position, it's likely that the star will get help from a sturdy backup like Dalot or Shaw as he develops his game.\nHe's one for the future – but he's also one for right now, with the club seeing him as a first-teamer now and next term.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Staying.\nTyrell Malacia\nAge: 25\nWage, as per Capology: £37,500-a-week\nContract expiry: 2026\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €12.00m\nIt seems strange to remember a time when hopes were high for Tyrell Malacia's Manchester United career.\nUnfortunately, left-back proved to be the one position that United couldn't afford an injury-prone deputy – see Luke Shaw – and Malacia has been rebuilding his reputation out on loan at PSV in his native Netherlands.\nWith a year left on his contract, it's almost certain that Malacia gets sold this summer… unless he digs in. In the unlikely event that he'd rather run his deal down, take the wages and leave on a free, he may go on loan once more – though given his desire for game-time in January, it's more probable that he'll cut his losses and move.\nFourFourTwo verdict: To be sold.\nCentral midfielders\nCasemiro\nAge: 33\nWage, as per Capology: £350,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2026\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €20.00m\nAfter winning just about everything under the sun in Madrid, Casemiro was decent in his first season at Old Trafford, but has since become an albatross around the neck of the club.\nNow 33, the Brazilian is a shadow of his former self – which wouldn't be quite so catastrophic if he wasn't United's highest earner, too. His very presence prevents United from making bigger moves in the market this summer… and the Red Devils have another year of this to come.\nThe need to sell Casemiro is huge, though the opportunities are scant: he's still playing sporadically, while only really Saudi Arabia can match or improve those mammoth wages.\nIt remains to be seen whether United actually let him leave this summer: even terminating his deal requires a payment and at worst, Casemiro can at least slot offer a body in an injury crisis (something Amorim has become accustomed to). The power lies with the player and whether he wants to take himself out of this situation, it seems.\nFourFourTwo verdict: To be sold – or at the worst, see his contract terminated… though not a foregone conclusion.\nKobbie Mainoo\nAge: 19\nWage, as per Capology: £25,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2027\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €55.00m\nRuben Amorim hasn't exactly gushed about Kobbie Mainoo to the degree that some United fans have, leading some to wonder whether the academy graduate could be moved on this summer.\nThe devil on the Portuguese's shoulder would surely consider it: Mainoo is worth a lot of money with a contract expiry coming up, the biggest clubs in Europe would likely fight over his signature and provide a much-needed cash injection this summer.\nFor an ownership looking to stay popular with the fans, however, offing their brightest youngster seems nonsensical. Furthermore, FourFourTwo understands that Mainoo is actually interested in re-signing terms and remaining at United beyond his current deal.\nThey couldn't sell him… could they?\nFourFourTwo verdict: Staying… unless things get desperate financially.\nManuel Ugarte\nAge: 24\nWage, as per Capology: £120,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2029\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €50.00m\nManuel Ugarte joined just last summer from Paris Saint-Germain.\nThat alone suggests that the Uruguayan is staying another season, despite failing to set the world alight. It doesn't exactly feel like a unanimous opinion that Ugarte is a man who can lead United to glory – but he's been fine enough to warrant another year, especially with the lack of numbers in the centre of the park.\nOver time, the 24-year-old may have to fight for a place, but given that there are others with bigger question marks over their future, Ugarte will likely get time and space to develop into the player that United hope he can become.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Staying.\nToby Collyer\nAge: 21\nWage, as per Capology: £5,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2027\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €5.00m\nToby Collyer has made it off the bench a fair amount this season and hasn't looked out of place in the Premier League.\nThat's kind of what you want from a youngster who's estimated to be on £5,000 a week – but with his contract winding up in 2027, that's not something United will be saying this time next year.\nCollyer could grab the chance over the next 12 months to prove himself a worthy starter in midfield, but if he doesn't, a Championship move at some point before his contract ends seems the most likely option for the 21-year-old.\nFor now, numbers are far too scant for his exit to be a pressing issue.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Staying, unless an offer comes in.\nAttacking midfielders/wingers\nAlejandro Garnacho\nAge: 20\nWage, as per Capology: £50,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2028\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €45.00m\nAlejandro Garnacho very nearly left for Napoli in January: we'd be shocked if he was still at United come August.\nIt's not that Garnacho isn't good enough for United: it's that he's highly valuable, currently earning low wages compared to his talent and his sale counts as pure profit for United to pass Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).\nWith the Argentina international an odd fit for Amorim's 3-4-3 formation, there aren't many opportunities better for the Red Devils to cash in on a player that they won't be utterly hamstrung without – and with Garnacho a signing from Atletico Madrid as a youngster, fans won't be quite as up in arms as they would be from an academy player who grew up as a United fan getting sold.\nIt just makes sense to sell right now. Whether Napoli return for Garnacho remains to be seen: don't discount Chelsea, another club in Spain or even an ambitious Premier League rival from making a big bid.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Leaving, for £50m or more.\nAmad Diallo\nAge: 22\nWage, as per Capology: £120,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2030\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €35.00m\nPotentially United's best player prior to his injury, Amad Diallo signed a new deal in January.\nIf his good form under Amorim was reason enough to keep him, Amad answers another conundrum as a player versatile to play in either one of Amorim's attacking midfield spots or at wing-back.\nNot only will Amad be a star that Amorim invests in over the coming months, the Ivory Coast international may well become the blueprint for what the manager looks for in that position, looking to bring in similar players this summer as he reshapes his squad.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Staying.\nAntony\nAge: 25\nWage, as per Capology: £60,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2027\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €20.00m\nAs so many have after leaving Old Trafford, Antony is thriving at Real Betis on loan.\nUnfortunately for the Andaluscians, there's no option to buy the Brazilian – despite Betis team-mate Isco claiming the club should crowdfund to extend his loan.\nUnited allowed Antony to leave in January on the condition that they paid the majority of his salary, in order to let the winger play himself into form for a move elsewhere: and now that's worked, they shouldn't have a problem finding interested parties who want to sign him this summer.\nAntony will hopefully be willing to take a pay-cut for the right move – the only problem is that United are going to make an incredible loss on the £80m or so that the BBC reported they spent on the star, who is still the seventh-most expensive Premier League player of all time.\nRight now though, needs must.\nFourFourTwo verdict: To be sold… whatever the loss.\nBruno Fernandes\nAge: 30\nWage, as per Capology: £300,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2027\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €55.00m\nThere's said to be interest in Bruno Fernandes: and why wouldn't there be interest in a world-class no.10 at a club who need to sell stars?\nBut with Ruben Amorim personally ensuring that his countryman remains at Manchester United, those rumours seem to be non-starters – not to mention Fernandes' age and salary making any possible exit difficult.\nJust as with Casemiro, however, the power is with the player: does Bruno want to stay?\nAt 30, the Portuguese has limited opportunities to win big trophies and after giving the best part of his career to a club who have been, at best, dysfunctional since signing him, no one would begrudge him a move to a European giant for one last go at the Champions League and a league title.\nUnited would surely consider such an exit, given how much money it would bring in.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Staying… unless he's had enough.\nChristian Eriksen\nAge: 35\nWage, as per Capology: £150,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2025\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €6.00m\nChristian Eriksen has been a smart transfer, all things considered.\nThe Dane joined for free after his short-term stint at Brentford and has been valuable cover for the Red Devils – but for a while now, he's not really been in first-team consideration.\nA contract expiry this summer is the perfect break for all considered and a good opportunity for United to put those high wages to better use elsewhere.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Leaving on a free transfer.\nJadon Sancho\nAge: 25\nWage, as per Capology: £150,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2026\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €30.00m\nChelsea have an agreement to sign Sancho for around £20m this summer.\nReports that the Blues could in fact refuse that obligation and pay not to sign the winger are an indictment of the way that his career has gone – but whether Manchester United agree to that is another matter entirely.\nSancho is another star who will leave for vastly less than what the Red Devils paid for him, but with United needing money desperately right now, they'll snatch £20m with both hands for a player on £150,000-a-week – especially given Sancho can walk for free next summer.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Leaving… one way or another.\nMason Mount\nAge: 26\nWage, as per Capology: £250,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2028\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €28.00m\nManchester United play much better when Mason Mount is in the team: and yet Ruben Amorim would likely snap your hand off if a £30m offer came in.\nThose are the peculiar circumstances that United and Mount find themselves in: the former Chelsea star still hasn't got up to speed at Old Trafford and may never, due to consistent injury problems.\nMount is to be filed with so many others: right now, United would just like to get a good run of games out of him rather than cashing in… but that doesn't mean they wouldn't listen to offers.\nHow likely are offers? Well, unless an Arsenal or Liverpool are desperate for a creative no.8 after shelling out for a nine-figure striker this summer and want to take a massive gamble on the England international's availability, consider Mount a United player for the foreseeable.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Staying.\nStrikers\nChido Obi Martin\nAge: 17\nWage, as per AllNigeriaSoccer: £30,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2029\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: —\nManchester United are very, very excited by Chido Obi, who has smashed goal records in youth football for fun.\nMaking the step up to the Premier League has been testing – but Amorim expected that when he threw the teenager into the deep end. The question that he has to answer is whether he wants to keep on developing him here or elsewhere.\nThere will be interest in Obi from teams who want to offer him first-team minutes. United will look to assess whether they can actually do that next season in the cups and latter stages of games before deciding on where Obi plays his football.\nThis is a long-term project and the Dane isn't expected to lead the line right now… but who knows when he'll be ready?\nFourFourTwo verdict: Staying, possibly heading on loan.\nJoshua Zirkzee\nAge: 23\nWage, as per Capology: £105,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2029\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €35.00m\nJoshua Zirkzee has had a mixed season to say the least, improving over time but still not playing at the standard that he did for Bologna last term.\nWere United flush with prolific forwards, a move back to Serie A on loan would seem like the obvious answer – maybe Juventus, were former boss Thiago Motta still in charge. Alas not.\nRasmus Hojlund has been just as disappointing as Zirkzee this season and is not only worth more money than the Dutchman, Zirkzee has the added bonus of being able to play behind the striker.\nAnd to cap it all off, a hamstring injury at the weekend has probably sidelined Zirkzee for at least three months, meaning that a transfer is even unlikelier. Looks like another season of development for the forward at United.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Staying.\nMarcus Rashford\nAge: 27\nWage, as per Capology: £75,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2028\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €50.00m\nMarcus Rashford has been reborn since Amorim became manager: the only problem is that it's at Aston Villa.\nOn one hand, the £40m option for the Midlands side to sign the England international is looking a little on the low side every time he has a good performance: on the other hand, it still might be too steep for Unai Emery to bite.\nVilla have their own PSR concerns and missing out on Champions League football might limit their ability to take Rashford permanently. You'd imagine they'd find the room for him, given his impact since January – but stranger things have happened.\nA reconciliation between Roobs and Rashy seems irrelevant right now with £40m of pure profit available for the taking – and United won't struggle to get that from another buyer even if Villa pull out.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Leaving – probably to Aston Villa.\nRasmus Hojlund\nAge: 22\nWage, as per Capology: £85,000-a-week\nContract expiry: 2028\nValue, as per Transfermarkt: €45.00m\nRasmus Hojlund was another eye-watering buy – a base fee of £64m, according to the BBC – who has simply failed to deliver.\nMaybe that's harsh on a 22-year-old who is still learning the ropes as a no.9 and can still have an excellent career ahead of him: but with United needing someone to propel them up the table right now, Hojlund is coming under increasing fire.\nIt might be a surprise for some to see him go but United are in salvage mode right now, with Antony, Sancho and Rashford all rehabilitated elsewhere – and Hojlund is the sensible next option for a fresh start, whether that's on loan or a permanent exit.\nIt hinges, of course, on a new signing. But if Manchester United can afford throwing another £50m at another striker – when have Manchester United not found the change down the sofa to do that? – Hojlund's days as Amorim's starting no.9 are numbered.\nFourFourTwo verdict: Leaving.\nThe 2025/26 Manchester United squad\nFourFourTwo makes that at least £100m – as an extremely conservative estimate – that United could fund from the exits of Onana, Malacia, Casemiro, Antony, Garnacho, Sancho and Hojlund. That means that we expect the club to move for between three and six new signings this summer, should those exits all happen.\nThe priority has to start in midfield, with a successor for Casemiro a must – though whether United want to bring in someone to replace Ugarte or simply act as a backup remains to be seen. Ideally, the club would bring in another player in that position, too, for depth – though they could rely on attacking midfielders Fernandes and Mount to fill in the gaps when necessary.\nA new striker seems sensible given the struggles of Hojlund and Zirkzee, with Viktor Gyokeres a major target for the Red Devils. Ideally, the club would also bring in another attacking midfielder/winger to replace the outgoing Antony, Rashford, Garnacho and Sancho, with Amorim's side struggling for goals.\nFinally, another goalkeeper seems likely given the problems that Amorim has had with choosing a no.1 this term. United have a decision to make over whether they want to spend big on a replacement to Onana or bring in someone to compete with him – but for our money, a third-choice also needs signing to replace the outgoing Heaton.\nUnited's summer budget is currently unknown.\nMark White is the Digital Content Editor at FourFourTwo.
