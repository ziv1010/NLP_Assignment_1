From the golden generation of the 1990s to the modern stars lighting up stadiums across the globe, as active stars like Alex Iwobi and Moses Simon edging closer to legendary status, PETER AKINBO examines the top 10 most capped players in Super Eagles history\n- Ahmed Musa – 111 caps, 16 goals (2010–present)\nAt the summit of Nigerian football’s appearance records sits Ahmed Musa, the captain fantastic, whose longevity and dedication have seen him represent his country 111 times since his debut in 2010.\nMusa’s finest hour on the international stage came at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, where he scored both goals in Nigeria’s 2-0 victory over Iceland, becoming the first Nigerian player to score more than once at a World Cup. The former CSKA Moscow and Leicester City star has featured in four Africa Cup of Nations finals, winning gold in 2013, bronze in 2019 and silver in 2023. He has also represented Nigeria at two World Cup tournaments (2014 and 2018).\n- Vincent Enyeama – 101 caps (2002–2015)\nVincent Enyeama’s name is synonymous with excellence between the posts. The legendary goalkeeper became only the second Nigerian player to reach the century mark for international appearances, cementing his status as one of Africa’s greatest shot-stoppers.\nEnyeama made his debut for the Super Eagles in 2002 and went on to serve as Nigeria’s undisputed number one for over a decade. The Kaduna-born goalkeeper’s crowning achievement came at the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa, where his heroics helped Nigeria lift the trophy. He was named the tournament’s best goalkeeper and earned a place in the Team of the Tournament.\nEnyeama’s performances at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil further enhanced his reputation. He made crucial saves throughout the tournament and kept Nigeria competitive as they reached the round of 16.\nThroughout his career, Enyeama represented Nigeria at three World Cups (2002, 2010, and 2014) and six Africa Cup of Nations tournaments. He captained the Super Eagles on numerous occasions and was known for his leadership and professionalism.\n- Joseph Yobo – 100 caps, seven goals (2001–2014)\nJoseph Yobo stands as a colossus in Nigerian football history, becoming the first player to reach the magical 100-cap milestone for the Super Eagles. The commanding centre-back was the rock upon which Nigeria’s defence was built for over a decade.\nBorn in Kono, Rivers State, Yobo made his international debut in 2001 and quickly established himself as an assured presence in the heart of defence. The defender’s trophy cabinet includes an Africa Cup of Nations winner’s medal from 2013. He also represented Nigeria at the 2002, 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, providing stability and composure at the highest level.\n- Alex Iwobi – 90 caps, 10 goals (2015–present)\nAlex Iwobi’s journey to becoming one of Nigeria’s most capped players is a story of consistency, versatility, and unwavering commitment to the Super Eagles’ cause.\nThe Fulham midfielder, who was born in Lagos but raised in England, faced a crucial decision early in his career. Having represented England at youth levels, Iwobi chose to pledge his international allegiance to Nigeria in 2015, a decision that has proven mutually beneficial.\nHe made his senior debut for the Super Eagles in October 2015 in a friendly against the Democratic Republic of Congo and has since become an indispensable member of the squad. His technical ability, tactical intelligence, and work rate have made him a favourite of successive coaches.\nIwobi’s most significant goal for Nigeria came on October 7, 2017, when his strike against Zambia in Uyo secured the Super Eagles’ place at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia—their most recent appearance at the Mundial.\nThe 29-year-old midfielder has been part of some of Nigeria’s most memorable campaigns in recent years. He played in all matches as the Super Eagles finished third at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt and was ever-present as Nigeria claimed second place at the AFCON 2023 finals in Ivory Coast.\nWith 90 caps, Iwobi now sits joint-fourth on the all-time list alongside John Obi Mikel. At 29, with potentially several years of international football ahead of him, Iwobi is on course to move further up the rankings and could yet challenge the top three positions.\n- John Obi Mikel – 90 caps, six goals (2005–2019)\nJohn Obi Mikel’s international career mirrored his club success—characterised by consistency, professionalism, and an ability to perform at the highest level for an extended period.\nThe midfielder made his Super Eagles debut in 2005 and went on to captain Nigeria with distinction, earning 90 caps over a 14-year international career. His composure on the ball, tactical discipline, and leadership qualities made him the heartbeat of the Nigerian midfield.\nMikel’s crowning achievement came at the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa. His performances throughout the tournament were exemplary, combining defensive solidity with intelligent distribution. He was named Man of the Match in the final as Nigeria defeated Burkina Faso 1-0.\nThe former Chelsea star also led Nigeria to Olympic football bronze in 2016, adding another medal to his impressive collection. He represented the Super Eagles at two FIFA World Cups (2014 and 2018) and multiple Africa Cup of Nations tournaments.\n- Moses Simon – 86 caps, 10 goals (2015–present)\nMoses Simon received his first call-up to the Super Eagles in March 2015 under coach Daniel Amokachi and made his debut on March 25 of that year in an international friendly against Uganda, replacing Anthony Ujah after 59 minutes.\nThe diminutive winger’s playing style is characterised by electric pace, trickery, and an ability to create chances from seemingly nothing. Operating primarily from the left flank, Simon has tormented opposition full-backs with his direct running and clever movement.\nHis most important contributions have come in recent years. Simon was a key member of the squad that finished as runners-up at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, where his pace and creativity troubled the best defences in Africa. He also played a crucial role in Nigeria’s Unity Cup triumph in 2025.\nWith 86 caps, Simon now sits joint-sixth on Nigeria’s all-time appearance list alongside legends Nwankwo Kanu and Muda Lawal. At the peak of his powers and still a regular starter for the Super Eagles, Simon is well-positioned to climb higher up the rankings.\nHis contributions have been recognised beyond football—Simon has been honoured as a Member of the Order of the Niger, one of Nigeria’s highest national honours, in recognition of his service to the country.\n- Nwankwo Kanu – 86 caps, 12 goals (1994–2011)\nNwankwo Kanu, affectionately known as “Papilo,” remains one of Nigerian football’s most beloved figures. His elegance, technical ability, and knack for producing magical moments made him a joy to watch throughout his 17-year international career.\nKanu burst onto the global scene as a teenager, starring in Nigeria’s FIFA U-17 World Cup triumph in 1993. His performances earned him the Golden Ball as the tournament’s best player, announcing his arrival as a generational talent.\nThe following year, Kanu was instrumental in Nigeria’s triumph at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, scoring the winning goal in the semi-final against Brazil and again in the final against Argentina. The victory remains one of Nigerian football’s greatest achievements, and Kanu was at the heart of it.\nHis club career took him to Ajax, Inter Milan, Arsenal, and West Bromwich Albion, where he won numerous trophies, including the UEFA Champions League, Premier League titles, and FA Cups. Throughout this success, Kanu remained committed to the Super Eagles.\nKanu’s crowning achievement with Nigeria came at the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations, where the Super Eagles emerged as champions. Though still a teenager, Kanu’s contribution was significant in what would be Nigeria’s second AFCON title.\nThe forward represented Nigeria at the 1998, 2002, and 2010 FIFA World Cups, with his performances in France ‘98 particularly memorable. His ability to hold up play, bring teammates into the game, and create chances made him a unique striker.\nKanu’s 12 goals for Nigeria, whilst respectable, do not fully capture his impact. His vision, passing ability, and capacity to unlock defences with a moment of genius made him invaluable to the Super Eagles for nearly two decades.\nHe retired from international football in 2011, leaving behind a legacy as one of Africa’s greatest-ever players.\n- Mudashiru Lawal – 86 caps, 11 goals (1975–1985)\nMudashiru Lawal, better known as “Muda Lawal,” was a midfield general whose consistency and quality made him a cornerstone of the Super Eagles during the 1970s and 1980s.\nLawal’s decade-long international career coincided with a golden era for Nigerian football. He was a key member of the squad that won the Africa Cup of Nations in 1980, Nigeria’s first-ever AFCON title, defeating Algeria 3-0 in the final in Lagos.\nThe midfielder was known for his technical ability, vision, and leadership on the pitch. His 86 caps represented remarkable consistency during an era when international football was less frequent than today, making his achievement all the more impressive.\nLawal’s 11 goals for Nigeria demonstrated his ability to contribute in attack as well as control proceedings from midfield. He was a complete midfielder who could defend, create, and score—a rare combination that made him indispensable to the Super Eagles.\nHe represented Nigeria at multiple Africa Cup of Nations tournaments and was a respected figure in African football throughout his career. Lawal’s professionalism and dedication set standards for future generations of Nigerian midfielders.\n- William Troost-Ekong – 83 caps, eight goals (2015–present)\nWilliam Troost-Ekong has been a cornerstone of the Super Eagles’ backline since his debut in 2015, establishing himself as one of Nigeria’s most reliable and decorated defenders.\nBorn in the Netherlands to a Dutch mother and a Nigerian father, Troost-Ekong chose to represent his father’s homeland—a decision that has proven to be mutually beneficial for player and country.\nHis international journey began in June 2015, when he made his debut for the Super Eagles in an AFCON qualifying match against Chad. Since then, Troost-Ekong has consistently delivered solid performances, proving to be a commanding presence in the heart of defence.\nAt the delayed 2021 AFCON tournament, Troost-Ekong not only captained the Super Eagles but also earned a spot in the tournament’s Best XI of the Group Stage, thanks to his impressive performance against Guinea-Bissau.\nHis crowning achievement came at the 2023 AFCON in Ivory Coast, where he was named Player of the Tournament. Leading from the back, Troost-Ekong scored crucial goals and marshalled the defence superbly as Nigeria reached the final.\nWith five goals at the 2023 tournament, Troost-Ekong holds the record for the most goals scored by a defender in a single edition of the Africa Cup of Nations.\nWith 83 caps already to his name and still playing at a high level, Troost-Ekong is well-positioned to climb further up Nigeria’s all-time appearance list.\n- Austin ‘Jay-Jay’ Okocha – 73 caps, 14 goals (1993–2006)\nAustin “Jay-Jay” Okocha was not just a footballer; he was an artist whose canvas was the football pitch. The midfield maestro captivated fans worldwide with his flair, creativity, and trickery that bordered on the supernatural.\nOkocha made his official debut for Nigeria in May 1993, in a 2-1 defeat to Ivory Coast during the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification. From that moment, he became an instant fan favourite, mesmerising supporters and opponents alike for over a decade.\nHis dribbling skills were otherworldly—opponents often appeared hypnotised as Okocha glided past them with the ball seemingly glued to his boots. His signature move, “the Okocha turn,” became iconic, leaving defenders bamboozled and spectators in awe.\nOkocha’s vision and passing ability were equally remarkable. He could unlock defences with a single pass, threading the ball through impossible gaps with precision and imagination. His free-kicks were works of art, often finding the top corner with devastating accuracy.\nAfter attending his first AFCON in 1994, Okocha represented Nigeria at the 1998 and 2000 editions as a key member of the squad. He then captained the Super Eagles at three consecutive tournaments—2002, 2004, and 2006—finishing in third place in all three, demonstrating consistent excellence under pressure.\nOkocha’s performances at the FIFA World Cup further cemented his legendary status. He represented Nigeria at the 1994, 1998, and 2002 tournaments, with his displays in France ‘98 particularly memorable. His solo goal against Spain and overall performances showcased his ability to shine on football’s biggest stage.\nPerhaps Okocha’s finest moment came at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, where he was instrumental in Nigeria’s gold medal triumph. His performances throughout the tournament were sensational, combining skill, creativity, and decisive contributions.\nHe retired from international football after the 2006 AFCON, ending a glittering career that had seen him become one of Africa’s most celebrated players. Even today, mention “Jay-Jay Okocha” anywhere in the world, and football fans’ eyes light up with memories of his magical performances.",
