I heard that [Barcelona] had to sell players or lower player salaries and the truth is that I didn't want to go through that,\" Messi said after announcing his intention to move to MLS.\nWith Messi on his way out of the French capital, PSG are hoping to convince Silva that a return to Ligue 1 is his best option - although at this stage it's believed that a move to Barcelona would be the player's preference.\nNevertheless, sources have told 90min that Silva and his representatives have a good relationship with PSG's current Director of Football Luis Campos, having previously worked together at Monaco.\nSilva famously won the Ligue 1 title with Monaco in 2017, ironically scoring a stunning goal against PSG to end the club's 17-year wait for a top-flight championship.\nLISTEN NOW\nOn this week's edition of Talking Transfers, part of the 90min podcast network, Scott Saunders is joined by Toby Cudworth and Graeme Bailey to discuss Ange Postecoglou's appointment at Spurs, Man Utd chasing Rasmus Hojlund, Harry Kane to Real Madrid, Lionel Messi & more!\nIf you can't see this embed, click here to listen to the podcast!",
