Intimidation and threats of violence are all part of what I have had to deal with.”\nOn the day of the first match of the season against PEC Zwolle on August 11, which was played behind closed doors on the mayor’s orders, fans circulated messages on social media to “visit Dijksma at home”, she said.\nMembers of the hardcore fans’ section De Bunnikside stood in her street in their black hooded tops as a police helicopter circled overhead.\nPhoto of children\n“Is it not enough that these kinds of public messages directly affect the safety of me and my children and my freedom to move around?” she asked.\nDijksma also demanded that fans take down a photograph of her three children from social media. “Aside from the fact that this photo is my private property, I expect my children to be kept out of the discussion,” she said.\nOther politicians came out in support of the mayor. VVD MP Eric van der Burg said: “What an unbelievably good letter!” while the mayor of Stadskanaal, Klaas Sloots, called Dijksma “a mayor who states clearly how things are and draws a line while still keeping the door open.”\nThank you for donating to DutchNews.nl.\nWe could not provide the Dutch News service, and keep it free of charge, without the generous support of our readers.
