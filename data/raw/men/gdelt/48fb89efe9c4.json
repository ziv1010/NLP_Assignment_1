  "body_text": "Lauren James signs long-term contract with Chelsea\nLauren James has signed a new contract with Women's Super League champions Chelsea to run until the summer of 2027.\nAfter re-signing for the Blues in 2021, James helped the club to a league and FA Cup double and was influential as they repeated the trick in 2022/23, also reaching the League Cup final and the semi finals of the Champions League.\nThe 21-year-old told Chelsea's official website: \"It's an amazing feeling to extend my stay at the club I love and where I feel most at home. I’m looking forward to the future and I want to reach my full potential.\n\"I want to be the best version of me as a player and as a person, helping to inspire the next generation. It definitely feels like home and it’s always been the place I’ve wanted to be.\"\nThe new contract comes a day after James was included in England's squad for the upcoming World Cup in New Zealand and Australia. It is the first time she will participate in a major tournament for the Lionesses.\nChelsea teammates Mille Bright - who has been named captain - Niamh Charles and Jess Carter are also on the plane.\nJames was also a winner in the inaugural Women's Football Awards last week, picking up the Young football player of the year prize alongside Liverpool's Missy Bo Kearns.\nMagdalena Eriksson and Pernille Harder had previously confirmed their summer exits from Chelsea, with Bayern Munich expected to sign both on free transfers.",
