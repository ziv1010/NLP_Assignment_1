He fears United cannot afford to wait until the summer to seal a deal and that they will live to regret a failure to land him if they leave it until next summer, especially with Barcelona hovering.\nMan Utd looking to seal January deal for Belgium teenager Vermeeren\nTo that end, Ten Hag could even look to seal his signing in January but allow the player to finish the season in Belgium with Antwerp.\nIronically, Antwerp face Barcelona in the Champions League on Tuesday night with the match seen as a real chance for Vermeeren to showcase his rising potential.\nAntwerp head coach Mark van Bommel, himself a former Barcelona midfielder, admits the LaLiga champions would sign the teenager in a heartbeat if given the chance.\nThe 5ft 11in midfielder has already represented his nation’s Under-21s and is being tipped to one day form a solid future midfield partnership with Romeo Lavia for the Belgium team.\nMaking his debut last season as Antwerp won a first Belgian title since 1957, Vermeeren has so far played 26 times for the side known in his homeland as The Great Old.\nWEST HAM CLEARED TO MAKE HUGE HUGO EKITIKE SIGNING\nWest Ham have been given the greenlight to complete a monster January move for Hugo Ektike with the PSG striker determined to force through a move to the London Stadium.
