Former Sydney player Fiona Worts struck twice after Madeleine Caspers had opened the scoring for the visitors.\nMelbourne have gone unbeaten both at home and in the Asian Champions League since their grand final defeat to Sydney, a 27-match run.\n\"Words can't describe the feelings that are going through my body at the moment, I am super proud,\" said City coach Michael Matricciani, who took over at the start of the season when Dario Vidosic left for English club Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\"One trophy down, to go undefeated - I couldn't ever imagine that,\" added Matricciani to Paramount+. \"It is a true testament to the determination, focus and quality of these girls. All credit goes to them.\"\nThere was never any chance of City losing the Invincibles tag at the Sam Kerr Football Centre with Otto heading in a near-post corner then Henry sliding in a Loudes Bosch pass in the opening minutes.\nAfter Phonsongkham's penalty, given for handball, Otto headed in another Alexia Apostolakis corner at the near post before McNamara completed a slick passing move that typified City's attacking elan.\n\"I haven't seen it back yet but watching it live was pretty special,\" said Matricciani, as he shook off the effects of being given an unexpected ice-bath by his players mid-interview.\n\"This is something we have been working on a lot for the last six-seven weeks, combination play around the box, especially when teams are sitting seven, eight, nine players behind the ball, how we can unlock that. We've been getting close and tonight that was a super goal.\"\nThe icing was added by McKenna with a long-range free-kick.\n\"These moments are very special.\" said Matricciani. \"I'm really pleased, after the season I might enjoy it a bit more, but we've still got a lot of football to play.\"\nTogether with runners-up Melbourne Victory, City now go straight into the second stage of the play-offs. Adelaide, Canberra United, Central Coast Mariners and Western United will contest the first stage with the fixtures to be determined by the rest of the weekend's game.\nAustralian Associated Press",
