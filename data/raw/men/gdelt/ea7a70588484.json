while that outcome is not yet guaranteed, the visitors will head to Bergamo with fond memories of Italian showdowns.\nIndeed, Chelsea have won their last three European games against Serie A sides while keeping a clean sheet every time, but since tearing Barcelona to shreds in the English capital, the Conference League holders have hit a painful plateau.\nMaresca’s men have only claimed two points from three Premier League games, a miserable run that includes a 3-1 loss to Leeds United and a forgettable goalless draw with Bournemouth at the weekend.\nAs is the case with their visitors, though, Atalanta also go into matchday six on the back of a domestic setback, as their three-game winning run across all competitions came to an end in a shock 3-1 Serie A loss to Hellas Verona on Saturday.\nCurrently missing the influential Moises Caicedo in the Premier League due to suspension, Chelsea will have the Ecuadorian midfielder back available for the meeting with Atalanta.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk\nBayern to bounce back to winning ways as they host Sporting\nAfter seeing an end to their perfect start in the Champions League campaign, Bayern Munich look to bounce back to winning ways as they welcome Sporting Lisbon to Allianz Arena on Tuesday.\nThe Bavarians suffered a 3-1 defeat on their trip to the Emirates Stadium on matchday five, while Sporting Lisbon dispersed Club Brugge 3-0 at Estadio Jose Alvalade.\nThat loss at the Emirates stands as the only blemish on an otherwise stellar unbeaten competitive season for Vincent Kompany’s side, who have won 20 of their 22 games (D1, L1) in 2025-26, including the most recent three with 11 scored in that sequence.\nThe Bavarians put five past hosts Stuttgart without reply at the weekend, courtesy of a Konrad Laimer early opener and a Josip Stanisic finish slotted between Harry Kane’s hat-trick off the bench, leaving Bayern eight points clear at the top of the Bundesliga standings.\nA poor away record against German opposition does not make the challenge any better for Sporting, who have lost 14 of 17 such outings (D2, W1), the most recent being a goalless draw against Borussia Dortmund in the knockout playoffs last season, which ensured their exit following a 3-0 aggregate loss.\nAlthough Luiz Dias’s three-match ban for his red card in Bayern’s clash with PSG has been reduced, the Colombian will still miss this match to see his sanction through.\nAs a result, Serge Gnabry should start at left wing, while Michael Oliseh operates on the opposite flank, with both players providing support for the in-form Kane, who is expected to return to leading the line following an impactful performance off the bench.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk\nFixtures\nKairat 15:30 Olympiakos\nBayern Munich 17:45 Sporting CP\nAtalanta 20:00 Chelsea\nBarcelona 20:00 Frankfurt\nInter Milan 20:00 Liverpool\nMonaco 20:00 Galatasaray\nPSV 20:00 Atletico Madrid\nTottenham 20:00 Slavia Prague\nUnion Saint-Gilloise 20:00 Marseille",
