He also took the Spain Euro Championship title last year.\nHe emerged as the 'Best Young Player' in the competition. The only setback was the club's UEFA Champions League dreams being crushed in the semifinal against Inter Milan.\nYamal joined stars like Ousmane Dembele, Jude Bellingham, Erling Haaland, Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe, among others, as one of the nominees for the football's top individual prize, which is a Golden Ball.\nCurrently on international duty with Spain, Yamal admitted that he dreams of securing the coveted prize and expressed how delighted he was to be nominated for the award. The ceremony for the 2025 Ballon d'Or will take place on September 22 at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris.\nSpeaking to RTVE, the teenage attacker said, as quoted by Goal.com: 'As a team, winning the Champions League with Barca would be incredible, and individually, every player wants to win the Ballon d'Or, and anyone who tells you otherwise is lying. Being there at 18 is something to be valued, and I hope it happens.'\nYamal will be in action next against Bulgaria for Spain in the World Cup Qualifiers. Their second qualifying game of the September international break is against Turkey on Sunday. Spain will be eyeing the prize, which they won once back in 2010, when it takes place in Canada, Mexico and the USA from June 11 next year. (ANI)",
