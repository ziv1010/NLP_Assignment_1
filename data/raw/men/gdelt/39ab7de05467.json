It’s a good service.”\nLegal and political limits\nWhile Mr Trump has hinted at punishing SpaceX, any serious attempt to cancel or redirect federal contracts are likely to lead to legal challenges. Ms Forczyk said such actions would break procurement laws.\n“Contracts by Nasa and the US Department of Defence are won by competition. In many cases, SpaceX is the best competitor,” she said.\n“In a few cases, SpaceX is the only company capable of doing what the US government needs, such as launching astronauts to the International Space Station.\n“Companies that feel they are treated unfairly can legally protest contract awards, as SpaceX did in 2014 and 2019.\n“Political biases should not play a part in contracting decisions, and contracts under suspicion of political bias could be challenged in court. It would be illegal for President Trump to cancel a federal contract with SpaceX and give that same contract to a competitor company.”\nTough times at Nasa\nThe Trump–Musk dispute comes at a time when Nasa is under heavy funding pressure. A proposed budget cut of nearly 25 per cent for the 2026 fiscal year could jeopardise dozens of scientific missions.\n“I don’t think it’s too far off to say that Nasa is facing its worst-ever crisis,” said Gordon Osinski, a planetary scientist at Western University in Canada.\n“The Artemis programme to return humans to the Moon seemed to be safe but given the crucial role of SpaceX in this endeavour, even that could now be in jeopardy.”\nThe face of SpaceX\nWhile SpaceX has consistently delivered on launch services and human space flight, its image is closely tied to Mr Musk’s unpredictable behaviour and political views.\n“The SpaceX brand is so deeply tied to Elon Musk that it is seen as an extension of him,” said Mr Nierman.\n“That makes the political risk of the Trump–Musk feud harder to contain. The company’s best move right now is to maintain institutional calm, keep its head down publicly, and double down on performance behind the scenes.”\nHe said that the firm’s long-term reputation would benefit from separating its operational excellence from Mr Musk’s personal identity.\nA push for competition\nThe argument may serve as a catalyst for Nasa and the Department of Defence to broaden their portfolio of providers, by increasing investment in Blue Origin, Northrop Grumman and emerging launch firms.\nDr Atri said that while SpaceX currently leads in terms of capability and cost-efficiency, building a diversified and resilient space economy is in the national interest.\nBlue Origin was awarded a second Human Landing System contract by Nasa, but its lander is not expected to be ready until after the 2030s.\n“That company is rapidly building the capabilities needed to challenge SpaceX in rocket launches,” said Dr Atri.",
