  "body_text": "The departure of Jurgen Klopp was a huge shock to the system for Liverpool fans. As the most successful Anfield coach of the last 40 years, he had won over the Anfield crowd with an exciting brand of attacking football that had led them to their first-ever Premier League title.\nArne Slot, his replacement, knew he had big shoes to fill, but the start to his Liverpool career has been a solid one. For him to be a true success, he’s going to need several of his big players to hit top gear, but who will these be as the season gets into full swing?\nHere’s a lowdown on the five key players that will make or break Slot’s tenure.\nMo Salah\nAs Mo Salah enters the final years of his career, he continues to look like one of the best Premier League players of all time.\nDespite the team’s recent struggles and the departure of Jürgen Klopp, Salah’s ability to consistently find the net means The Reds are always lethal attacking force.\nAs one of the world’s best attackers, Salah’s speed, dribbling skills, and clinical finishing make him a nightmare for defenders.\nWhile the team faces challenges with a new manager and a lack of signings, Salah’s determination and commitment will be key in making the transition a smooth one.\nIf he can maintain his form and stay healthy, he has the potential to lead the Reds to success in both the Premier League and Champions League.\nJarell Quansah\nSlot may have a surname that sounds like an online casino game, but his defensive tactics so far have been anything but a gamble.\nIn defence he’s opted for the steady hand of Virgil Van Dyk once again and he has a wealth of choices to go alongside him. Out of all of them, though, it’s young Jarell Quansah who’s exciting the Anfield crowd.\nThe 21-year-old from Warrington looks to have all the tools to become a top centre-back with pace, strength and aerial ability among his chief abilities.\nThe youngster has a fight on his hands with Ibrahima Konaté to nail down a regular starting berth but Quansah, who only just missed out on Gareth Southgate’s Euros squad in the summer, looks ready for the challenge.\nDiogo Jota\nDiogo Jota has the potential to be a game-changer for Liverpool this season. Despite facing injury setbacks in the past, his clinical finishing and intelligent movement make him one of the team’s most dangerous players in the final third.\nUnder the guidance of Slot, Jota’s versatility and ability to find space in the box could be a valuable asset in the Reds’ attacking system. His footballing IQ and composure in front of goal set him apart from many strikers.\nIf Jota can stay fit, he has the ability to get near the top of the Premier League scoring charts and help Liverpool compete for trophies across all competitions.\nYet, this is the fly in the ointment for Jota. His injury record has been poor over the last few years, which is a shame for a player that Portugal consider to be a key figure in their push of the World Cup in 2026.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold\nDespite criticism about his defensive ability, it would be foolish not to include Trent in a list of Liverpool’s top players this season.\nAlways threatening going forward, he may well play a more advanced role this season with the likes of Connor Bradley coming through at right wing-back.\nTrent’s right foot is one of the most feared in the world and his ability to smash in a lethal set-piece is one of the Anfield side’s most potent weapons.\nWill Slot value him as much as his predecessor, though? The early signs point to ‘yes’. A fit TAA is essential for both Liverpool and England’s prospects over the next three or four years.\nLuis Diaz\nWhat are three words to describe Luis Diaz since he joined Liverpool in 2022? There are probably many positive terms, but the one most likely to leave a Liverpool fan’s mouth is ‘exciting’.\nThe Colombian is close to becoming a ‘must-pick’ for The Reds with his effervescent displays that are just as likely to produce goals as assists. He has settled into an attacking force with Salah and co, and only really Cody Gakpo threatens him for a starting slot.\nAt 27, Diaz is older than he appears, so will be hoping for a few more trophies as he reaches his peak years. Liverpool fans will surely be hoping for the same.",
