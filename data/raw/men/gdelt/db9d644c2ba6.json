And that race was won by none other than Sam Kerr, living legend! This is the highest Kerr’s ever finished in the Ballon d’Or voting, after back-to-back third place finishes last season and the season before. Congrats!\nChelsea’s other nominees, Millie Bright and Guro Reiten finished 11th and 19, respectively, with Bright, who captained England to the World Cup final, actually the highest placed defender of all.\nCongrats to them as well!\nOn the men’s side, Lionel Messi won his eighth and presumably last Ballon d’Or, with treble-winner Erling Haaland probably wondering if he could’ve ever scored enough goals to eclipse Messi’s historic World Cup campaign and now also being America’s soccer messiah.\nJude Bellingham won the under-21 award (Kopa Trophy) while Emiliano Martínez got the goalkeeper award.\nFormer Chelsea players Kevin De Bruyne, Mohamed Salah, and Jamal Musiala finished 4th, 11th, and 26th, respectively, in the men’s Ballon d’Or voting. Thibaut Courtois was fourth in the Yashin Trophy rankings.",
