  "body_text": "Jean-Philippe Mateta scored the first goal of the game for Crystal Palace against Manchester United on Sunday and it came in unusual circumstances.\nLeny Yoro gave away a penalty at Selhurst Park as the Red Devils defender clumsily brought down Mateta in the box.\nThe Frenchman stepped up to take the spot-kick himself and found the bottom corner, but it was an odd finish which looked like it bobbled into the net at first glance.\nVAR had a look and it turned out Mateta had touched the ball twice, by kicking it onto his standing boot with his right foot.\nIn the past, that would have seen the goal ruled out for a double-touch, but things have changed.\nThese days, an accidental double-touch leads to a retaken penalty, so Mateta stepped up to face Senne Lammens again.\nThe second time round, he went to the other corner but the result was the same, with the Eagles striker finding the back of the net.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?
