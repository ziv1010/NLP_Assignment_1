We believe it would be irresponsible to risk creating a situation that could result in any ‘red on red’ conflict inside or outside the stadium.”\nClubs on Donnarumma alert\nGianluigi Donnarumma is open to a move away from Paris St Germain this summer but will not be pushed out by the French club, the PA news agency understands.\nThe Italy goalkeeper has been left out of PSG’s squad for Wednesday’s UEFA Super Cup match against Tottenham, and it is understood he will now leave Paris this summer if the right move opens up.\nManchester United have been linked with the 26-year-old, who is out of contract next summer, but it is understood there has been no contact.\nThe European champions completed the signing of Lucas Chevalier from Lille over the weekend.\nWhat’s on today?\nRangers take a 3-0 lead into the second leg of their Champions League third qualifying round tie against Viktoria Plzen in the Czech city.\nThe first round of the Carabao Cup also gets underway, featuring clubs from the EFL.",
