The post-mortem on their title challenge has already begun, with the club’s lack of potent attacking weapons quickly emerging as an area ripe for improvement.\nInjuries haven’t helped, though even with a clean bill of health Arsenal don’t possess a forward capable of putting up the numbers Mohamed Salah or Erling Haaland produce.\nWhat’s more, neither of their recognised strikers – Gabriel Jesus or Kai Havertz – look capable of notching 15 goals per season, never mind the customary benchmark of 20.\nArsenal are well aware of their need to strengthen in attack and per the latest from the Mirror, they do intend to splash the cash.\nYet despite having a warchest to unload, a sacrifice may be necessary to sign the calibre of players they crave.\nAccordingly, the report claims Arsenal could wave goodbye to either of Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard in the summer.\nMartinelli is Arteta’s regular starter on the left side when fit, while Trossard has become something of a super-sub since arriving from Brighton.\nYet tough choices will have to be made if Arsenal want to take the next step and per the report, either player could be offloaded to the Saudi Pro League where interest in the pair is present.\nAnd if the Gunners do succeed in selling Trossard or Martinelli, the club will be in a stronger position to pull off an almighty double coup…\nArsenal want £198m double signing\nArsenal’s dream scenario in the striker position is signing Alexander Isak.\nThe Swede, 25, continues to haunt Premier League defences and his mark of 19 goals this season trails only Salah (25) and Haaland (20).\nIndicating how deadly the Newcastle frontman is, Isak’s shot conversion rate of 28 percent is superior to both of his main rivals for the golden boot this season (Salah – 25 percent, Haaland – 21 percent).\nUnderstandably, Newcastle hold Isak in the highest regard and value the striker at a whopping £150m.\nA transfer of that size would obliterate the Premier League’s all-time record with regards to arrivals. Moises Caicedo by way of his £115m switch from Brighton to Chelsea is the current record holder.\nThe Mirror reaffirmed Arsenal want to sign Isak, while reports elsewhere have claimed the only way a deal is viable is if Newcastle miss out on Champions League football. The Magpies currently sit sixth in the table.\nBut per the Mirror, a new starting striker isn’t the only addition Arteta wants in the forward line.\nAn explosive new left winger is on the agenda too and Arsenal are already looking towards Spain.\nThe report stated: ‘the Gunners also want a new left winger which is why Trossard or Martinelli may make way with Athletic Bilbao star Nico Williams top of their list.’\nWilliams’ existing deal with Athletic contains a release clause worth €58m/£48m. Signing both he and Isak at Newcastle’s asking price would cost Arsenal a combined £198m.\nLatest Arsenal news – Midfielder deal agreed / Sterling theory\nIn other news, Arsenal are said to have agreed personal terms with Norwegian midfield sensation, Sverre Nypan.\nElsewhere, pundit Gary Neville has suggested Arsenal never actually wanted to sign Raheem Sterling who continues to feature sparingly despite the club’s injury crisis in attack.\nThe forward was named on the bench last time out against Nottingham Forest, with midfielder Mikel Merino flanked by Trossard and Ethan Nwaneri in the front three.\nSpeaking on The Overlap, Neville said: “Do you know what I think they’ve done? In the last part of the summer transfer window, I’m not sure Arsenal wanted to sign Raheem Sterling.\n“I’m not sure Arsenal, as a club, wanted him. I think Arteta’s thought Sterling can play in all the positions up top and has basically told the club to get him in as cover. I\n“think that’s what he said. He can play across the frontline so Arteta has looked at him as his second or third striker.\n“They’ve ended up backing him and I think that’s put them off doing another deal in January of the same ilk because they’re thinking we brought Sterling in and Arteta hasn’t really used him.”",
