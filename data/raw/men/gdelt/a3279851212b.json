It connects the thigh bone (femur) to the shin bone (tibia) and stabilises the knee.\nWhat is an ACL injury?\nACL injuries commonly occur during sports that involve sudden stopping, changes in direction and twisting — such as football and basketball.\nWhen ruptured, many people hear a pop or feel a \"popping\" sensation in the knee. They may also experience swelling, severe pain and a feeling of instability, as if the knee is \"giving way\".\nHow long does it take to recover from a ruptured ACL?\nIt is rare for a player to return from an ACL injury with less than nine months of rehabilitation and it often takes longer.\nChelsea said she would be \"assessed by a specialist in the coming days and then begin her rehabilitation with the club's medical team\".\nThe football tournament at the Olympics takes place from July 24 to August 10, which is in roughly six months.\nKerr's Matildas teammate Steph Catley was among those to offer her emotional support.\n\"Here with you every step,\" wrote Catley on X (formerly Twitter).\nMatildas midfielder Caitlin Foord also expressed her disappointment.\n\"We've got you,\" Foord wrote.\nAnother member of the Matildas' World Cup squad, Emily van Egmond, also reached out to Kerr.\n\"With you every step of the way always,\" she wrote.\nMatildas great Melissa Barbieri said no timeline could be put on when Kerr would return to the playing field.\n\"It's about ticking the boxes and making sure you get a strong recovery,\" she said.\n\"It can be as little as six months but as long as 18, depending on what can go right and what can go wrong.\"\nKerr's recent injury troubles\nThe ruptured ACL adds to an injury-marred past six months for Kerr.\nShe sat out the group stage of the Matildas' World Cup campaign because of a calf injury in her left leg.\nDespite fears she would not take the field at all during the tournament hosted by Australia and New Zealand, Kerr returned for the knockout rounds.\nShe came off the bench against Denmark and France, before starting in the 3-1 semifinal loss to England in which she scored a spectacular goal for the Matildas.\nShe later revealed she sustained a second calf injury in her right leg in the Matildas' 2-0 loss to Sweden in the third-place play-off.\nKerr, runner-up to Spain's Aitana Bonmatí at the Ballon d'Or awards last year, is Australia's record goal-scorer with 69 in 128 matches.\nShe has scored 99 goals in 128 matches for the club, winning the WSL Golden Boot twice, four league titles and three FA Cups.\nThe 30-year-old was recently joined in London by her partner, American player Kristie Mewis, who joined WSL rivals West Ham United.\nKerr is the latest high-profile player to suffer an ACL injury, which seems more prevalent in the women's game and is belatedly the subject of research into why this is the case.\nEllie Carpenter, Kyah Simon, Chloe Logarzo and Elise Kellond-Knight are among Australian players to have had ACL injuries in recent years.\nEngland's Beth Mead and Leah Williamson, Vivianne Miedema of the Netherlands and France's Marie-Antoinette Katoto were among a string of stars to miss the World Cup due to ACL injuries.\nAAP/ABC",
