From new signings to old names, there is plenty these players can surprise us with.\nChristopher Nkunku\nElectric for RB Leipzig for two seasons, Nkunku was one of many new signings who came unstuck at Chelsea. Injuries limited him to just eleven league starts for the Blues last season, but he stands out amongst the club’s impossibly large number of forward options. Nicholas Jackson has a very similar function in the squad, but his ankle injury leaves the starting berth open to the Frenchman.\nNkunku’s wonderful touch and tight control could bring around 20 goals this season, should he stay injury fit. Much depends on Enzo Maresca’s immediate success, and whether he has the guts to stick with the players he initially places his trust in. There is no lack of suitors. Nkunku could find himself flanked by any of Noni Madueke, Raheem Sterling, Pedro Neto, Mykhailo Mudryk, Cole Palmer or Marc Guiu.\nJean-Clair Todibo\nOf all the exciting names West Ham have acquired this summer, I believe Todibo is the one to get the most excited about. Everyone wants to see Niclas Fullkrug’s thunderbolts and flying elbows, whilst Leeds United fans will do their best not to mourn Crysencio Summerville’s lightning feet, but Todibo’s ceiling is sky-high.\nUnderlying statistics reveal the centre-back’s superiority in Ligue 1 last season at Nice. Once of Barcelona, the 24 year-old is likely to build on his two caps for France imminently, and I suspect will move on to bigger prospects at the end of this season or the next.\nAlexander Isak\nExpectation is riding high for Alexander Isak. Third top scorer last season, the Swede hit form towards the end of the season and there is a general feeling he is capable of kicking on and increasing his tally of 21 goals. Newcastle United are still aiming high, but a Champions League finish may be a stretch too far.\nCallum Wilson appears to have become merely an injury-prone substitute despite his excellent goal record for the Magpies. Out wide, service should be better than last season as Harvey Barnes should be fully fit to accompany Anthony Gordon. Jacob Murphy won’t get so much game time, and Miggy Almiron may be on his way out.\nJames Milner\nHe may be 38, but everyone’s favourite boring footballer has a mission to complete. After an injury-plagued season last time out, Milner has taken time out to completely reset, ensuring he is at full strength for this season. 20 more appearances will see the ex-England international surpass Gareth Barry at the top of the Premier League appearance charts.\nHe could do it too. An encouraging pre-season saw Milner play sometimes in an advanced midfield role. The potential for huge development in the Brighton midfield is likely to convince new manager Fabian Hurzeler to utilise the Yorkshireman’s incredible wealth of experience. Summer signing Max Weiffer and potential world-beater Carlos Baleba will be fending off competition in their positions from Bill Gilmour and Jakub Moder, who has finally shaken off the injury that saw him miss the entire 2022-23 season.\nLeif Davis\nCould this be the answer to England’s left-back troubles? Maybe not with Luke Shaw back fit (Manchester United fans keep your fingers crossed), but Davis’ development under Kieran McKenna’s management at Ipswich has been one of the most rapid in the country.\nEighteen assists in the Championship last season tells of the kind of attacking intent Davis is capable of, and McKenna has made it clear his side will not be compromising the front-foot approach that earned them promotion. Davis was their only representative in the Championship Team of the Season\nDaichi Kamada\nAnother new signing who might well catch the eye, Kamada was at the forefront of European football discourse two years ago thanks to his stunning performances for Eintracht Frankfurt. Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner worked with Kamada from 2021 to 2023, and has clearly seen something special in the attacking midfielder that he thinks is missing from his squad in Selhurst Park.\nThe Japanese will bring with him huge amounts of support from his native country, as his 33 caps have endeared him to the Samurai Blue. He will struggle to displace Adam Wharton, Jefferson Lerma, and Cheick Doucoure in Glasner’s three-man midfield, but a shift to a 3-4-3 formation in pre-season has brought goalscoring success for Kamada in a wide forward position.\nSavio\nWhilst eager to witness what Savio can bring to the Premier League, the Brazilian’s journey here is an ugly one. Full of flair and one-on-one trickery, expect Savio to produce a multitude of cut-backs for Erling Haaland to steamroll his way onto. At 20 years old, he will likely be second choice behind Bernardo Silva, but with Pep Guardiola’s rotation, he will still garner plenty of minutes.\nAn exceptional campaign for high-flying Girona in 2023-24 was enough for the City Group to transfer him to their biggest asset, Manchester City. This was despite him being contracted to second-tier French side Troyes, for whom he was their record signing. Savio moved to Manchester. Troyes were relegated. Savio never played a game for them.\nImage: Steffen Prossdorf via Wikimedia Commons",
