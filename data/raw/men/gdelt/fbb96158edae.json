  "body_text": "Duncan Ferguson has left Forest Green Rovers after less than 6 months as manager, and with only 1 win in 18 games.\nHaving been appointed in January with the club rooted to the bottom of League One, Ferguson went on to win just the one game in charge as he was unable to prevent the club from being relegated to League Two.\nHis solitary victory in charge was a tight 1-0 triumph over Sheffield Wednesday, who went onto to achieve promotion to the Championship via the play-offs. In his other 17 games in charge, he oversaw 3 draws and 14 defeats.\nFinishing on 27 points, Rovers sat rooted in 24th place, some 19 points from safety and 16 points behind 23rd-placed Accrington Stanley. It was a difficult spell for Ferguson in what was his first full-time head coach role, having previously been the caretaker manager at Everton on two separate occasions.\nHe had initially signed a 5-year-deal with the Nailsworth club and revealed upon his appointment that “I plan to be here for a while” but has now moved on before the start of the 2023-24 EFL campaign.",
