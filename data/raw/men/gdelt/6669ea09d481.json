But according to a recent report in Italian media outlet Primo Canale, Tottenham are \"moving most decisively\" for the attacker, who has now spoken about his future.\nSpeaking to Secolo XIX, in quotes relayed by Sport Mediaset, Gudmundsson appears to be saying his goodbyes to the Genoa supporters after two-and-a-half seasons in Italy.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\n“I will always be grateful to Genoa and its fans. I continue to think about match after match, I enjoy every moment on the pitch trying to entertain the fans as well,\" he said.\nIn FourFourTwo's view, this is definitely one to watch. Spurs have a good relationship with Genoa after signing defender Radu Dragusin in the January transfer window and Gudmundsson looks like the kind of player who could thrive under Postecoglou.\nMore Tottenham stories\nPlans for Tottenham's summer window are beginning already. One South American has been touted already, while the Lilywhites' transfer record could be broken with one signing.\nBrentford attacker Ivan Toney has been mentioned as a potential signing, too.\nAnd Ange Postecoglou has also dropped a transfer hint for the summer, the big tease.\nBen Hayward is a European football writer and Tottenham Hotspur fan with over 15 years’ experience, he has covered games all over the world - including three World Cups, several Champions League finals, Euros, Copa America - and has spent much of that time in Spain. Ben speaks English and Spanish, currently dividing his time between Barcelona and London, covering all the big talking points of the weekend on FFT: he’s also written several list features and interviewed Guglielmo Vicario for the magazine.",
