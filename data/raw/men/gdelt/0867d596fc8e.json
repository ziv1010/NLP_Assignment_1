  "body_text": "Alan Shearer has revealed his predictions for the opening weekend of the 2024-25 Premier League season as defending champions Manchester City take on chaotic Chelsea and newly-promoted Ipswich Town host Liverpool.\nLess than three months since lifting the Premier League trophy at the Etihad Stadium, Man City begin their bid for an unprecedented fifth consecutive title away at Stamford Bridge.\nThe new season gets underway on Friday night with Manchester United, desperate to improve since putting their faith in under-fire manager Erik ten Hag, welcoming Fulham to Old Trafford.\nIpswich play their first Premier League fixture in 22 years in the early Saturday fixture before Arsenal, runners-up for the last two seasons, begin their campaign against Wolves.\nFour other 3pm games are also on the agenda as Champions League side Aston Villa visit West Ham and play-off winners Southampton travel to Newcastle United.\nBrentford host Crystal Palace in a London derby on Sunday before arguably the weekend’s stand-out fixture takes place, Man City in action against Enzo Maresca’s Chelsea.\nThe first Monday Night Football clash of the campaign sees Championship winners Leicester City mark their return to the top-flight against exciting Tottenham.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nBetfair ambassador Shearer has delivered his verdict on the opening-weekend fixtures, tipping Manchester City to have ‘too much’ for Chelsea and the promoted teams to struggle.\nMan United v Fulham\n‘Man United have already played competitively in the Community Shield and I was impressed with what I saw at Wembley. They are at home too, first game of the season, so I’d expect them to win and will go for 3-1.’\nIpswich v Liverpool\n‘It’s always difficult when you turn up at a newly promoted club’s first game with the adrenaline of the crowd and the home players, I think this will be a really tricky game for Liverpool. However, I see them sneaking a 1-0 win.’\nPremier League top-four odds\nMan City 1/12\nArsenal 1/10\nLiverpool 8/15\nChelsea 6/4\nTottenham, Man United 13/8\nNewcastle 2/1\nAston Villa 10/3\n(Odds courtesy of Betfair)\nArsenal v Wolves\n‘I think Arsenal will be too strong at home for Wolves, and I do think this will be the season the Gunners can go all the way in the title race. I expect them to start with a comfortable home win, so I’ll go with Arsenal to win 2-0.’\nEverton v Brighton\n‘This is a tough one to predict. Everton are at home so that’ll be a good atmosphere for the first game of the season, and we don’t quite know how this new-look Brighton team will fare. I’ll go 1-1.’\nNewcastle v Southampton\n‘Newcastle will want to get off to a good start at St James’ Park, just like they did last season. It may’ve been different if it was at St Mary’s but because they’re at home, I’m going to say 3-1 Newcastle win.’\nNottingham Forest v Bournemouth\n‘I think Nottingham Forest may just have enough to edge this game, though I expect both teams to be fighting this season. How will Bournemouth play without Dominic Solanke? It may take some time, so I will say 2-1 to Forest.’\nAnfield gets nod from Prem fans\nA new Betfair survey of more than 2,000 football fans has revealed that Anfield is the stadium with the best atmosphere in the Premier League.\nThe poll, conducted by YouGov Sport, also found fans up and down the country are largely resigned to Manchester City winning the title for a fifth straight year, while supporters believe the top four will be made up by Arsenal, Liverpool and Man United.\nThis weekend, thousands of supporters will be cheering on their teams away from home, and people surveyed can’t be split on who the title of best away fans should go to, with Newcastle and Liverpool supporters both sharing top spot.\nWhen asked who the worst away fans are, Arsenal got over the line to clinch that title.\nWest Ham v Aston Villa\n‘It’ll be a tight game this one. West Ham have made some exciting signings, but so have Aston Villa. It may take time for some of those to really gel together for both sides, so I am happy to go with a score draw. 1-1.’\nBrentford v Crystal Palace\n‘A London Derby to kick off the season, live on TV on Sunday so could be an exciting one for us all to watch. It feels like these derbies often end in draw, but I fancy goals, so I’ll say 2-2 here.’\nChelsea v Man City\n‘Chelsea have had a poor pre-season but I wouldn’t take too much notice of that. However, they do have a brand-new manager and a whole host of new players, and when you have the stability and experience of Man City and Pep Guardiola in your first game, I think City will have too much for them. I’ll say 2-1 Man City win.’\nLeicester v Spurs\n‘Spurs are travelling to a newly-promoted team so there’ll be a lot of excitement, but I think they’ll have too much for Leicester, especially with the signings Ange Postecoglou has made. I’ll go with Spurs to win 1-0 on Monday night.’\nMore Trending\nFor more from Betfair Ambassador Alan Shearer, head to https://betting.betfair.com/football/alan-shearer/.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Erik ten Hag explains Harry Maguire injury status after limping out of Fulham win\nMORE: Erik ten Hag has one criticism for his Manchester United side after Fulham win\nMORE: Joshua Zirkzee the hero on Manchester United debut in narrow Fulham win",
