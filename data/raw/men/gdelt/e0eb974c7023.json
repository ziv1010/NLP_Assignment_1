Their troubles have also translated on to the European stage, sitting in 17th place in the Champions League after a draw to Feyenoord and a defeat to Ruben Amorim's former side Sporting CP.\nCity's next challenge, however, comes on Sunday when they travel to Anfield to face the mighty Reds. Liverpool have enjoyed an immense start to life under Slot, cruising to the top of both the Premier League and Champions League standings.\nBut, despite their current polar opposite situations, Slot knows that facing City will be no easy feat.\n\"I don't think anyone in the last eight or nine years - or even longer - would have said that City at home or away [is] easy,\" he told reporters in his pre-match press conference. \"Everybody is looking at their results. I've seen them as well. Against Brighton, they were 1-0 up, they could have scored for 2-0 or 3-0 but didn't. Then they got beaten 2-1.\n\"Against Tottenham, after 20 minutes they could have been two or three goals up, but they weren't. Against Feyenoord, that [losing a three-goal lead] has not happened many times. They were 3-0 up and then all of a sudden it was 3-3.\n\"They are still a very good team. One of the reasons why I think Pep Guardiola is the best manager in the world is he always comes up with solutions.\n\"His problem now might be that Rodri is out but we all know, at least I think, he will come up with a [solution and] that their form will come again - hopefully after Sunday. He [Guardiola] was the one who started playing with the inverted full-back, then he was the first one to play the centre-back as the no 6. I wouldn't be surprised if he came up with another idea nobody ever thought about before to make his team even stronger.\n\"That's the reason why he inspired so many managers around the world. Let's wait and see because many things have been done with football now. If there's anyone in this managerial world who can come up with something new, it's definitely him.\"",
