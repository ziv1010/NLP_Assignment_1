Since then the team have gone nine matches unbeaten.\nCentre-back Pau Cubarsi, 17, was given the player of the match award and Xavi lavished praise on the young defender, key in recent weeks.\n“He's a very rational kid, he's got a lot of brains, he's patient, he's very humble, he wants to improve,” said Xavi.“His sudden emergence is wonderful for Barcelona and Spanish football – we're looking at a top-level defender for years to come.”\nLike Xavi, Cubarsi said this was a match to remember.“This has been one of the best days of my life,” Cubarsi told Movistar.\n“The team deserves this player of the match trophy, I'm so happy, but we're a group.”\nBarcelona became the first team in the competition's history to start two players 17 or under in a knock-out stage game. Xavi demanded the fans turn their temporary Olympic Stadium home on the city's Montjuic hill into a pressure cooker, and they duly obliged. Over 50,000 spectators marked the club's largest attendance this season.\nFrancesco Calzona's Napoli wilted as the Spanish champions came out of the blocks flying. Electric 16-year-old winger Yamal made strong inroads down the right before the bright Lopez opened the scoring after 15 minutes.\nCancelo fed Raphinha who cut the ball back into the area for Lopez, who tucked home.\nWhile he may lack the metronomic precision of Pedri, the midfielder provides thrust and an insatiable desire to shoot.\nTwo minutes later and the Catalans doubled their lead against the shellshocked visitors, with Yamal starting the move by breaking loose in his own half on the counter-attack.\nThe winger played in Raphinha and although the Brazilian hit the post Cancelo was running in to roll home the rebound.\nNapoli battled their way back in when Matteo Politano slipped in down the right, with Ronald Araujo playing him onside. The Italy winger crossed for Rrahmani who slotted home cleanly to pull Napoli back into the tie.\nNapoli were almost level moments later but Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen made a superb save, tipping over Giovanni Di Lorenzo's header.\nThe Italians started the second half strongly, with Barcelona forced back into their own half, aimlessly clearing the ball.\nXavi took action by bringing on Sergi Roberto and Oriol Romeu for Lopez and Andreas Christensen, aiming to freshen up the midfield and give his team new impetus.\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
