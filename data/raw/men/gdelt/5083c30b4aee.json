  "body_text": "Yankuba Minteh is used to doing things in a hurry.\nHe is “the quickest player with the ball at his feet” ever seen at Odense Boldklub.\nHe scored after just three minutes of his first-team debut, a winner against Danish heavyweights FC Copenhagen.\nAnd now, after just one season in European football, the 18-year-old winger is set to move to Newcastle United, fetching his club a record fee of around 50million Danish Krone (around £6m).\nAdvertisement\nThe expectation is that he will spend next season, and possibly beyond, on loan. Even so, some close to him believe the move has come too soon.\n“I always tell young players that they should not overestimate their own abilities,” the Gambian under-20 coach Abdoulie Bojang told Danish newspaper Tipsbladet last month. “I still think it’s a bit early. He is still young. He lacks experience. If he goes to a big club and doesn’t perform, he’s stuck.”\nWhile Minteh has shown flashes of prodigious talent, remember this is also a teenager who was playing amateur football on the streets just 12 months ago. There have also been several minor disciplinary incidents, with Odense (known as OB) forced to manage their young asset carefully.\nWhat are Newcastle getting? With such little time in European football, nobody knows for sure.\nSummer transfer window on The Athletic…\n- Latest transfer news from The Athletic\n- Transfer targets for every Premier League team\n- What we’re hearing on 10 potential transfers\nOB were only convinced on the second occasion. Minteh was first brought to the club as a 16-year-old by his agent, Bakary Bojang. The Gambian-born former player had settled in Odense, the fourth-largest city in Denmark, after his retirement, and contacted academy boss Tonny Hermansen with two recommendations.\n“I watched some video with them and then we agreed that he could come up here with two players,” Hermansen told Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten in February. “At first, it was not Yankuba who caught the eye the most. But when he came back a little over a year later for the second training session, we saw a completely different player.”\nHis first trial was Minteh’s first exposure to professional football. Until then, he had been playing for Steve Biko FC in the Gambia, named after the murdered South African civil rights activist.\nThe Gambia is named after the river which flows through it, and whose shores the country’s borders hug. Minteh grew up in Bakoteh, a suburb of Serekunda, the largest city in the Gambia, which guards the river’s mouth. The second-youngest of seven children, his football-obsessed father, a former midfielder, was a rabid Bayern Munich fan.\nAdvertisement\nVideo footage from that time shows him playing on scrub pitches, where the ball bobbles over knees, never mind feet.\nAfter graduating from Bakoteh United to the more prestigious Steve Biko FC, he came to the attention of the national age-group sides, and subsequently, his Danish-based agent. The Gambia is not a prolific exporter of footballing talent, especially compared to Senegal, which surrounds it. Currently, their most high-profile player is forward Musa Barrow, now playing at Bologna after a long period in Gian Piero Gasperini’s Atalanta side.\nTo advance, he needed to leave the country. OB, through their connections with his agent, was an ideal choice. The club was also managed by Andreas Alm, a Swedish coach who has built his reputation on developing young players. Back in 2016, he was the coach that gave a 16-year-old Alexander Isak his debut for AIK. OB sporting director Bjorn Wesstrom held the same role at AIK at that time.\n“(Minteh’s) speed was what immediately stood out,” Wesstrom tells The Athletic. “And he’s got this ambition to go straight to the goal. Not the corner flag. Straight to the goal.”\nDirectness is a theme which comes up repeatedly. He averages over two shots per game, a high number for a winger, but directness is also a mantra by which Minteh seems to live himself. In February, just five months after his first-team debut, he courted minor controversy by making no pretence of his desire to play in a top league — and quickly.\n“Everyone in the Gambia thinks I can take it further,” he said. “Many of them say: ‘You should be in the Premier League.’ It just motivates me even more when I hear something like that.”\nAfter joining OB, initially in the Under-19 team, it only took two youth matches before he was promoted to the first team. In one performance, against Randers, he tormented the opposition left-back, cutting inside from the right onto his left foot.\nAdvertisement\nThough, at the time, reporters compared him to former Denmark winger Dennis Rommedahl, there is also a touch of Miguel Almiron — particularly due to the observation that he is faster with the ball than without it.\n“They could not hold him back,” Leif Rasmussen, who covers OB for local paper Fyens Stiftstidende, told The Athletic. “So they had to play with him in the first team, even though he was barely 18. He has qualities that no one else had.”\nThat chance came in September 2022, at home to eventual league winners Copenhagen. With the scores tied at 1-1 after 83 minutes, Alm took a risk. On came Minteh, replacing midfielder Franco Tongya. OB were going all out for the win — and Minteh would repay his coach’s faith.\nStriker Bashkim Kadrii pressed the Copenhagen defence, and Minteh, filled with enthusiasm, decided to chase the lost cause. When the ball squirmed away, the Gambian was on the edge of the box, unmarked, and with the chance to sidefoot home a shock winner. To emphasise the scale of the surprise, OB would lose the reverse fixture 7-0 in March.\n“He was an unknown kid,” said Hermansen. “He hadn’t even had his name printed on the back of his shirt.”\nAt OB, there is a tradition that players do not wear their names on the blue and white striped jersey until they have been permanently moved into the first-team squad. It took Minteh just two months — and he chose the number 30, the same one his idol, Lionel Messi, wears at Paris Saint-Germain.\nMore was to come. In a way, his finish against Copenhagen was relatively simple — but he immediately shattered any illusions of luck. Against Silkeborg, his next appearance, his speed led to an assist in a 1-1 draw.\nTwo weeks later, in the driving rain against Lyngby, he managed another two assists within the match’s first eight minutes. The first came from an inswinging cross…\nBefore he drew half the opposition defence and laid off the ball for fellow Gambian Alasana Manneh to drive home.\nWas there surprise at how quickly he had developed?\n“Yes,” admits Wesstrom. “But it goes very fast. When you see a player’s potential, then that’s the new standard. So maybe you’re surprised the first time, but after that it becomes an expectation.”\nAdvertisement\nSpotting his fast start, other clubs were already making the sporting director’s phone ring. Closer to home, however, Minteh was struggling to settle in Odense.\nInitially, he lived in a form of elite college, where the club paid for him to stay in a block of flats alongside other sportspeople, including footballers, handballers, and ballet dancers. However, Minteh did not enjoy living on his own, and found acclimatising to the Danish lifestyle an extreme change. He now lives with his agent, while his family are more regular visitors.\n“My first six months at the club have been hard, but when you work hard, things also come easier,” Minteh said in February.\nThose around Odense point to a sense of dislocation, as well as his age, as mitigation for the subsequent disciplinary issues he endured.\nThe first of these was relatively minor — he broke team curfew rules after being spotted in a nightclub on the Friday evening before a Sunday game. OB subsequently dropped him from the squad for the weekend, while he had to temporarily train with the reserves as punishment.\nHowever, the public backlash was fierce, with fans also upset at some forthright opinions from Minteh and his agent regarding his long-term future. After being harassed both online and in person, Minteh was granted a short time away from the club with stress.\nOn his return, Minteh started against then-league leaders Nordsjaelland. After being substituted in the 68th minute of an eventual 4-2 defeat, he kicked a corner flag to pieces. The Danish FA banned him for the next two matches.\nIn training, four days after that game, a frustrated Minteh fought with senior team-mate Mads Frokjaer-Jensen, witnessed by Rasmussen.\n“Minteh tried to tackle Frokjaer-Jensen from behind after being dispossessed, as revenge,” Rasmussen remembers. “And so he came after him; they didn’t actually hit, but four or five players had to separate them, and calm Minteh down. They moved on, but this is very uncommon for Odense.”\nAdvertisement\nDespite suspensions, things were still going well for Minteh on the pitch. He started every remaining game he was eligible for, and was prolific in April, managing a goal and three assists in one two-week spell.\n“He’s actually a very introverted person,” said Wesstrom on the issues. “If he comes into my office, he’s very quiet, and just says yes. But it’s a complex situation.\n“He’s very driven by making his family proud. They have their expectations, not just now, but for his future. And when his family isn’t there, communication with them is not always the easiest, so that has been one of the harder things to handle. The next stage for him is to mature as a person, to not be so affected by his feelings. By gaining composure, he can be more professional.”\n“He has great ambitions and almost has a kind of desperation in his life,” Alm said in February, “He wants to show everything he can.\nOne thing Odense’s staff have been impressed by is Minteh’s willingness to work hard. The winger has revealed he watches highlights of Europe’s top five leagues to study, while he is an enthusiastic defender, if not always the most efficient.\nSmarterscout gives players ratings from zero to 99 for various qualities, and in this case they are adjusted to how Minteh might perform compared with other Premier League forwards. These ratings relate to either how often a player performs a given stylistic action (for example, volume of shots per touch), or how effective they are at it (for example, how well they progress the ball upfield) compared with others playing in their position. They are also adjusted for the strength of the league.\nMinteh’s defending intensity puts him in the top percentile of all players, showing his desire to press — pivotal for an Eddie Howe side. Here, against Lyngby, he shows his impressive one-v-one defending.\nIn this example, against Silkeborg, his press leads to OB’s opening goal of the game.\nHowever, despite these examples, his overall defending impact score is only 25, placing him in the bottom quartile — suggesting a degree of overenthusiasm.\nAdvertisement\n“He was rash in a game against Horsens,” remembers Rasmussen. “He was so desperate to give away the ball that he gave away a penalty. He needs to learn to use his head, and that will come with experience I think.”\nTo a degree, his relatively low defending impact score is not helped by his frame — still distinctly a teenager’s body. Remember, he has only been living the life of a professional footballer for a single year.\nThe other key metric from his smarterscout profile is his carry and dribble volume, placing him in the top three per cent of players. Stylistically, his statistics closely match Bayer Leverkusen winger Moussa Diaby, who has previously been the subject of Newcastle interest.\nWith a deal close to completion, and expected to be formally finalised in the coming week, OB withdrew Minteh from last weekend’s game against FC Midtjylland, wishing to protect the value of their investment.\n“Of course, I want to go to Newcastle,” Minteh had said last month. “It’s a big club in the Premier League and they’re doing something good. They are fighting for a place in the Champions League. I am ready to take the next step, and it will only be good for me.”\nFor now, however, Minteh is not expected to form part of Newcastle’s first-team squad. A more likely pathway is that taken by Garang Kuol, signed in January, who spent the end of 2022-23 on loan at Hearts, and is also set to spend next season away from St James’ Park.\nIt is a model used extensively by Brighton & Hove Albion, Dan Ashworth’s previous clubs. Comparisons have already been made between Minteh and Simon Adingra, who signed for Brighton from fellow Danish side Norsjaelland last summer, before being loaned out to Brighton’s partner club Royale Union Saint-Gilloise. A first-team promotion is expected to follow.\nJust for the next season or two, Minteh may need to slow down, and be a little less direct.\n(Photo: Lars Ronbog / FrontZoneSport via Getty Images)",
