Newcastle were so unlucky in the first leg and no way did they deserve to lose.\nAnyway, back to the Premier League fixtures on Saturday and this is how the matches played out this afternoon…\nMan U 2 Man City 0\nChelsea 2 Brentford 0\nLeeds 1 Fulham 0\nLiverpool 1 Burnley 1\nSunderland 2 Crystal Palace 1\nTottenham 1 West Ham 2\nWhat this has also done, is simply confirm how much things have opened up for Newcastle United in the league.\nA complete transformation in Premier League fortunes, if United can win at Molineux on Sunday.\nThat would give Eddie Howe’s side a full 12 points from their last four PL games, send them up to fifth in the table and only a point behind Liverpool who are currently fourth.\nIf Newcastle win against Wolves, it would mean that in their last four Premier League games they had gained:\nEight points on Liverpool (four draws in their last four PL matches)\nNine points on Manchester City (three draws and one defeat in their last four PL games)\nSeven points on Chelsea (one win, two draws and one defeat in their last four PL matches)\nSix points on Man U (one win and three draws in their last four PL games)\nAs I said earlier, this just shows how quickly things can change in the Premier League, if you can put a run of wins together.\nA win at Molineux would be huge for Eddie Howe and his Newcastle United players, I think they will make it four in a row for sure and be in such a strong position to qualify for Champions League football, for a third time in four seasons.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
