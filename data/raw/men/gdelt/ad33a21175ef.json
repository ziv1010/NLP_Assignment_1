Their recent record in both La Liga and the Champions League shows that this is a special period for them, even by their own incredibly high standards. Our starting point is to respect this because nothing else would make sense. It would certainly be strange if we went into this game thinking they are anything but a top side.\n\"At the same time, we have earned the right to have confidence in ourselves. The work that the players have done up to now has put us in the position that we are in – both at home and in Europe – so we know that when we apply ourselves the right way, stick to our principles and believe in what we are trying to do, we can be competitive against anyone.\n\"We are enjoying the situation that we are in at the moment and recognise the potential that exists, but we also know that it is still very early in the season. As things stand, we have played less than one-third of our Premier League fixtures and tonight's game will take us just past the halfway point in the Champions League group.\n\"Yes, a lot of football has been played and we are happy with the points we have taken in both competitions but there is a lot, lot more still to come. Now isn't the time to look back, it is the time to look forward with an ongoing sense of what we still have to do.\n\"This is something that Real have shown themselves to be world leaders at. Yes, they are always aware of what they have done but mainly from the perspective of what they have to do next. If this approach is good enough for them, it is definitely good enough for everyone else.\n\"I know it sounds boring but I will not apologise for repeating that we will be taking every game as it comes. The alternative really wouldn't be logical, especially given how quickly matches come around when you are playing Champions League and Premier League. The next game is literally the most important one. It is a chance to maintain standards, to increase belief and take more points, which means there is no need to look any further ahead when there is a challenge right in front of you.\n\"I would like to welcome Carlo Ancelotti, his staff and the players and supporters of Real to Anfield. Carlo knows English football and he also understands what football means in this part of the country having managed Everton, so he will bring a wealth of knowledge and experience with him. He also comes with an incredibly strong squad that has a phenomenal record of success and which shows no signs of easing up.\n\"The easy – and stupid – mistake to make would be to look at the current standards in the Champions League and believe Real's threat has diminished. The reality is the leaves have only just fallen from the trees. How many times have clubs like Real found themselves in this kind of position in autumn only for it to feel like a trick of the mind by the time we reach spring? It is a story almost as old as football itself.\n\"For us, it is about recognising and embracing the excitement of a week in which we will host both the champions of Spain and the champions of England at Anfield. Again, these represent opportunities for us to continue with our work and a chance also for our crowd to do what it does best.\n\"With every passing home game, I have been able to enjoy the Anfield atmosphere more and more and I know that these are occasions when the supporters need no second invitation to get behind the team so I am really looking forward to that.\"",
