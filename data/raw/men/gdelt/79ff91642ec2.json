The Red Devils returned a record of one win, one draw and four defeats. Their four-point tally was only good enough for last place, with United not even transferring to the Europa League by way of finishing third.\nUndoubtedly the biggest disappointment was losing 4-3 to Danish side Copenhagen on November 8. United led 2-0 and 3-2, though Copenhagen’s dramatic comeback was completed in the 87th minute by 18-year-old Roony Bardghji.\nDespite his tender age, the Kuwait-born Sweden Under-21 international is a regular starter at Copenhagen.\nBardghji is the jewel in their attacking crown, with the left-footed winger notching 11 goals in 30 appearances across all competitions this season.\nBardghji has been tipped for a career at the very top and as you might expect, the Premier League vultures have begun to circle.\nIndeed, Football Insider put Brighton in the frame in mid-November. The Seagulls have proven themselves a fantastic place for young talent to develop in recent years.\nElsewhere, Chelsea were labelled ‘crazy’ about signing the forward, while Man Utd and Tottenham too have also taken note.\nChelsea desperate to wrap up January agreement; likely fee revealed\nNow, according to online outlet 90min, it’s Chelsea who are determined to press ahead with a move and wrap up an agreement as soon as possible in the upcoming winter window.\nFirstly, it’s claimed Copenhagen are open to cashing in on their teenage sensation. FI previously concluded a bid of £30m plus add-ons could be enough to seal a deal.\n90min add Chelsea are ‘keen to beat the queue’ and will seek to strike an agreement with Copenhagen ‘immediately’.\nShould the Blues be successful, Bardghji will then remain in Denmark for the remainder of the season before linking up with his new Chelsea teammates over the summer.\nBut while Chelsea are the keenest to forge a deal, there is no shortage of high profile competition.\n90min go on to state Aston Villa, Brentford, Brighton, Fulham, Man Utd, Newcastle and Tottenham have all held discussions with intermediaries regarding a transfer.\nInterest from mainland Europe is also widespread, though it’s Chelsea who are the most determined to snap up the forward who devastated Man Utd’s UCL campaign.\nDON’T MISS: Prem legend tips Man Utd to win the league THIS season, with Arsenal, Liverpool, Aston Villa ignored",
