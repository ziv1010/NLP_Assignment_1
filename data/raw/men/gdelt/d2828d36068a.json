  "body_text": "Tuesday’s briefing: Thomas Frank fights on as Spurs gear up for Dortmund clash\nThomas Frank continues to cling to his job as Tottenham boss, despite a lack of reassurance over his future.\nArsenal striker Gabriel Jesus has backed team-mate Viktor Gyokeres to come good, while Marc Guehi has spoken of his relief after finally completing his move to Manchester City.\nIn the Premier League, 18-year-old Charalampos Kostoulas scored a bicycle kick in added time as Brighton snatched a 1-1 draw with Bournemouth at the Amex Stadium.\nFrank fully focused on Dortmund clash\nFrank insists it is business as usual heading into Tottenham’s Champions League clash with Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday but has received no assurances about his future.\nFrank faced chants of “you’re getting sacked in the morning” from Spurs fans towards the end of Saturday’s 2-1 home loss to West Ham, which made it one victory in eight matches and eight defeats in 14.\nThe Press Association understands talks have taken place at Tottenham over whether to cut short Frank’s tenure after only seven months, but he remained defiant on Monday and revealed he had lunch with chief executive Vinai Venkatesham, sporting director Johan Lange and Nick Beucher, the son-in-law of Spurs co-owner Vivienne Lewis.\nFrank said: “I’ve just been feeling the trust along the way. I’ve said that at every press meeting, that there is backing and support.”\nJesus springs to defence of fellow Arsenal striker\nJesus has offered his support to Gyokeres following his fellow Arsenal’s striker’s difficult start at the Emirates Stadium.\nJesus, who spent 11 months out following surgery on a ruptured cruciate ligament, could be handed his first Champions League start since December 2024 in Arsenal’s clash with Inter Milan on Tuesday.\nHe is set to replace Gyokeres, who has scored just eight goals since he signed for the Gunners and was replaced by Jesus in the second half of Saturday’s goalless draw at Nottingham Forest.\nJesus said: “I have been in the position like Viktor is in now and it is not easy, but I am sure that everyone here – not only the coach, the staff, the players as well – is going to support him and give him the belief that he is here to help us.”\nGuehi ‘relieved’ to land deal with City\nEngland centre-back Guehi expressed relief after finally completing his £20million move from Crystal Palace to Manchester City.\nThe 25-year-old, who was close to joining Liverpool last year, could have moved as a free agent in the summer, but City opted to act after being hit with a defensive injury crisis.\nGuehi had been linked with a number of clubs and is pleased the speculation over his future can now end.\n“It’s a relief,” he said. “I’m very proud and very excited to get started.\n“This move feels like the culmination of all the hard work I have put into my career. I am now at the best club in England and part of an unbelievable squad of players. It feels good to be able to say that.”\nBrighton boss Hurzeler full of praise for teenage star\nBrighton boss Fabian Hurzeler praised teenage star Kostoulas after his stunning stoppage-time bicycle kick salvaged a points at home to Bournemouth.\nThe Seagulls had been frustrated for much of the match and looked set for defeat after a controversial 32nd-minute penalty from Marcus Tavernier.\nBut substitute Kostoulas struck with his second goal in English football in dramatic fashion and Hurzeler said: “A great goal, but in the end we all prefer to win these type of games.\n“He has the skill to do these kind of things, we know it. Now it’s about doing the other things well.”\nWhat’s on today\nThe Champions League action returns with Frank and Tottenham facing a crunch clash against Dortmund in north London.\nArsenal, who have all but secured their place in the next stage, take on Serie A leaders Inter at San Siro, while Manchester City head into the Arctic Circle to face Bodo/Glimt.\nIn the Championship leaders Coventry face in-form Millwall, while Salford and Swindon face off for the right to book a lucrative FA Cup fourth-round trip to face Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City.",
