However, after just two substitue appearances, the Brazilian has now suffered a hamstring tear and is set to miss the next four to six weeks.\nConsidering Neymar has made just seven appearances in total for Al-Hilal since his £75m transfer from PSG in the summer of 2023, and the fact he earns around £130m a year, patience is growing thin at the Saudi Pro League leaders, with a contract termination under consideration.\nRonaldo, therefore, is reportedly being lined up as his replacement. On the surface, a deal would be easy to conclude, too, with Saudi Arabia's Private Investment Fund (PIF) owning both Al-Nassr and Al-Hilal (as well as Al-Ittihad and Al-Ahli).\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nVIDEO: Why Man United Wanted Ruben Amorim So Badly\nDespite that, even if the two clubs are unable to agree a fee for the sale of Ronaldo, the Portuguese forward is out of contract at the end of the 2024/25 season anway. He'd then be available to move for free.\nIn FourFourTwo's view, it feels like anything could happen with Ronaldo and the Saudi Pro League. Al-Hilal are currently top of the table and therefore feel like the side Ronaldo would prefer playing for, while the exact nature of a transfer is unclear.\nRyan is a staff writer for FourFourTwo, joining the team full-time in October 2022.
