They won all six matches in the Champions League group stage, notably defeating Wolfsburg home and away, before crushing Bayern Munich 6-1 on aggregate in the quarter-finals.\nMeanwhile they remain unbeaten in their domestic league and are favourites to claim an 18th French title in 19 years. It has been a fairly seamless transition to life under new coach Montemurro, the Australian who took over last July on a two-year deal.\nMontemurro, who spent the previous three years in Italy at Juventus, had the tough task of succeeding Sonia Bompastor on the Lyon bench. Bompastor captained Lyon when they won their first Women’s Champions League title in 2011, and coached them to the most recent of their record eight crowns in 2022.\nShe also took them to last season’s final, in which they were beaten 2-0 by Barcelona in Bilbao, before leaving to take charge of leading English side Chelsea. However, Lyon kept their squad together, and even strengthened by adding the likes of Tabitha Chawinga, the Malawian who was the top scorer in the French league last season with Paris Saint-Germain.\nThey also signed Brazil defender Tarciane in February from Houston Dash in the United States for a reported transfer fee of almost one million euros ($1.13m), a French record. In the Champions League, destiny dictated that Lyon’s path towards the final would see them come up against Arsenal.\nMontemurro coached Arsenal for three and a half years until the end of the 2020/21 season, leading them to the English Women’s Super League title in 2019. “I said to the players that we’re only halfway there, we’re not there yet,” Montemurro said after the first leg.\n“Arsenal will go into the second leg with no pressure -- they’ve just got to go for it and, sometimes when the pressure is off, that can be dangerous.” Montemurro therefore tried to temper excitement around Lyon that the team might make it to Lisbon on May 24 for what would be their eighth final in the last 10 seasons.\n“I always have faith in my team. The circumstances are obviously favourable... but I would never want to underestimate Arsenal,” he said. “They are a formidable side, a fantastic side, and we still have a job to do in Lyon.”\nWhile Arsenal warmed up for the trip to France by beating Leicester City 5-1 in midweek, Lyon won 2-0 at Nantes in their domestic league. Lyon’s emblematic captain and centre-back Wendie Renard is hoping to return from injury in time to make her 500th appearance for the club. The hosts are hoping for a crowd of at least 20,000 for the game, although that is a long way short of their stadium’s capacity of almost 60,000.\n-\nKate Middleton Proves She's True 'children's Princess' With THIS Move\n-\nPaul Anka Reveals How He Raised Son Ethan Differently From His Daughters\n-\n'A Very Special Visitor' Meets Queen Camilla At Clarence House\n-\nJodie Turner Smith Shares One Strict Rule She Follows As A Mom\n-\nHailey Bieber Reveals KEY To Balancing Motherhood With Career\n-\nPhoto Of Jay-Z, Other Prominent Figures With Jeffrey Epstein Proven To Be Fake\n-\nHillary Clinton's Munich Train Video Sparks Conspiracy Theories\n-\nFans Slam Talk Show Host For 'cringe' Behavior In Chris Hemsworth Interview\n-\nWoman Jailed Over False 'crime In Space' Claim Against NASA Astronaut\n-\nJames Van Der Beek’s Close Pal Reveals Family's Dire Need Of Donations\n-\nPrince William And Harry's Cousins Attend 'Wuthering Heights' Event\n-\nHailey Bieber Turns Heads Just Hours After Major Business Win\n-\nKing Charles' Andrew Decision Labelled 'long Overdue'\n-\nTimothee Chalamet 'forever Indebted' To Fan Over Kind Gesture\n-\nColumbia University Sacks Staff Over Epstein Partner's ‘backdoor’ Admission\n-\nOzzy Osbourne's Family Struggles Behind Closed Doors",
