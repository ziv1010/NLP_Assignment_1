  "body_text": "Manchester United failed to beat 19th placed Burnley and were held to a 1-1 draw in their Premier League game at Old Trafford on Saturday.\nAs has become the norm this season, the hosts yet again conceded a late goal with the Clarets deserving their luck after creating so many chances throughout the game.\nThis season, United have conceded late goals against Chelsea, Brentford, Liverpool and Coventry City and Erik ten Hag’s chaos ball tactics are largely to blame.\nOpposition teams have found the press easy to bypass and with injuries devastating the backline, the Dutchman has had to constantly shuffle his pack and the lack of consistency has also not helped.\nDefensive issues at United\nCurrently, Casemiro is partnering Harry Maguire in the heart of the defence with Raphael Varane, Jonny Evans, Lisandro Martinez, Victor Lindelof and Willy Kambwala all sidelined.\nThe Brazilian and Englishman have conceded six goals in three games – three against Championside side Coventry, two against bottom of the league Sheffield United and the Burnley equaliser.\nWith Varane and Evans‘ contracts expiring in June and with both Maguire and Lindelof linked with moves away, it is clear to see that INEOS need to strengthen at the back.\nBarcelona star Ronald Araujo is one of the defenders linked with a move to the Theatre of Dreams with Bayern Munich also reportedly in the race.\nBut as The Peoples Person relayed recently, United are prepared to blow the Bundesliga giants out of the water in order to secure the Uruguayan’s services.\nUnited set to open talks with Araujo\nAs per CaughtOffisde, United are ready to enter talks with the player’s agent and are reportedly prepared to pay €100 million for a transfer this summer.\nThe 25-year-old has helped keep 10 clean sheets this season and has been an ever-present member of the backline with Xavi keen to hold on to him.\nBut the Catalan giants are under immense financial pressure and they need to sell a few big-name players with the Uruguay international open to a move should he receive a decent salary and a long-term offer.\n“Manchester United are ready to enter into talks with the agent of Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo ahead of a potential €100million transfer move this summer, CaughtOffside understands.\n“Araujo wants to stay at Barcelona, while the club are also not keen to sell, but there are various moving parts involved that could sway things in Man Utd’s favour.\n“Sources with a close understanding of Araujo’s situation have informed CaughtOffside that although the Uruguay international is an important player to Barca, their financial situation means they’d consider selling some big names this summer.\nAraujo price revealed\n“For Araujo, that could mean seriously considering offers in the region of €100m, while the player himself would also be open to leaving the Nou Camp for a long-term contract with a good salary.”\nThe only stumbling block could be the lack of Champions League football on offer in Manchester while Bayern could offer the player the chance to keep playing in the premier European competition.\nAraujo’s current salary stands at 134,615 per week (as per Capology) and the Red Devils should have no problem breaching the 200 thousand mark for the player should INEOS sign off on the deal.\nBringing in a long-term target would be a great opportunity but whether the club have the money to spend big on one player remains to be seen. Maybe Varane’s departure and selling a couple of defenders could help in this regard.\nWant to be the first to hear breaking Man United news?
