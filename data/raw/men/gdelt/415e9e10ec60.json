He made countless saves to stop us, while at the other end the ball is deflected onto them and in.\nWe have absolutely no luck against certain teams. Handballs are ignored, fouls waved away etc etc.\nSome players did well and we seemed to give it a go at least.\nStill, that’s what 115 charges and PSR give you.’\nMatt Busby said…:\n‘Sadness is my overriding emotion as the final whistle blows this evening.\nWe have made a decent fist of defending the trophy we won 11 months ago, but came up well short over two legs, against a football club that epitomises everything that is wrong with the game we love.\nI don’t care that Man City have won every honour the game has to offer, the lack of passion from their fans and the sheer number of empty seats was gobsmacking. It was a semi final for goodness sakes!’\nDavid Punton:\n‘A humiliating night as our grasp on the League Cup slipped away.\nWe were so bad in that first half it was eye watering.\nIn all the years he’s been in charge, Eddie Howe has overseen some of our worst displays this season. It had shades of Alan Pardew / Steve Bruce about it.\nThe way we let them race to a 3-0 lead was embarrassing. We gifted them all of those goals.\nThe gulf between the two clubs looked wider than a mile.\nAs holders, it’s always hard to follow up the success, and I have to say we really do miss Isak.\nThis is a tough time at the moment, for manager and players.’\nSimon Ritter:\n‘No miracle at the Emptyhad Stadium but we did at least win the second half of the second half of this tie.\nMore pertinent is conceding seven goals between the 41st minute at Anfield and the 32nd minute tonight.\nWe were lacking Schar and Livramento in defence, went to a 5-3-2 or a 3-5-2, but Man City found plenty of space to cut through us, just as Liverpool did.\nOne explanation is that without Guimaraes in midfield and with Tonali playing his 41st match of the season, our midfield is stretched beyond breaking point.\nYet we still made enough chances tonight to have put our opponents under severe pressure.\nIf we had taken even half of them, the miracle would have been a possibility.’\nTony Mallabar:\n‘Massively disappointed. Not with the result, as Man City ran out deserved winners..but a missed opportunity to step up after the luckypool defeat on Saturday.\nMany on here will have a more articulated opinion. But I am going to buck the trend on here about all the empty seats tonight.\nGoing to football ain’t cheap or accessible anymore to your normal Joe/Anna.\nSo when we get success, hopefully we will show a lot more humility to our fellow working class fans.’\nThe Armchair Fan:\n‘Champions, finalists, semi-finalists and quarter-finalists isn’t a bad record in the League Cup over the past four seasons.\nWe’ve lost the tie by four goals but tonight we missed golden chances from Willock, Gordon, Wissa and Elanga as well as having two VAR checks for a penalty and had a goal disallowed.\nWhen you also consider Wissa’s two chances in the first leg and Bruno hitting the post, things could have ended very differently.\nBeat Villa in the FA Cup and Qarabag in the Champions League and we can all start dreaming of another trophy for NUFC.’\nManchester City 3 Newcastle 1 – Wednesday 4 February 2026 8pm\nMatch Stats\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nElanga 62\nMan City:\nMarmoush 7, 29 Reijnders 32\nPossession was Newcastle 37% Man City 63%\nTotal shots were Newcastle 12 Man City 18\nShots on target were Newcastle 5 Man City 8\nCorners were Newcastle 4 Man City 5\nTouches in the opposition box Newcastle 14 Man City 34\nNewcastle team v Man City:\nRamsdale, Trippier (Osula 76), Thiaw, Botman, Burn, Hall (Jacob Murphy 46), Tonali, Ramsey, Willock (Elanga 46), Gordon (Barnes 44), Woltemade (Wissa 46)\nSubs:\nPope, Alex Murphy, Neave, Shahar\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
