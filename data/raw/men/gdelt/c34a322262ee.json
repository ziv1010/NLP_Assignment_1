  "body_text": "The inaugural ‘league phase’ of the Champions League this season has just wrapped up, with the new format producing some thrilling entertainment.\nThe reforms came after six years of meticulous planning, testing and experimentation. According to UEFA, the change was geared towards more “unpredictability”, “fairness” and “dynamic competition”.\nInstead of the usual eight groups of four – with the top two teams advancing, the new structure featured a single 36-team table. Teams were sorted into four Pots based on their last five years of competition history, with the strongest in Pot 1 and the weakest in Pot 4. Each team then played eight fixtures—two from each Pot. The top eight teams advanced directly to the Round of 16, while teams ranked 9–24 now enter a two-legged playoff for the remaining spots. There are definitely some exciting draws lined up for this knockout phase, including a Man City-Real Madrid showdown.\nWithout doubt, we’ve already seen some remarkable football. Underdogs like Aston Villa, on their first Champions League campaign of the 21st Century, and Lille have secured top 8 whilst big hitters like Manchester City, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Juventus, and PSG have been forced into the playoffs. Things looked especially unpromising for Pep Guardiola’s side when Man City struggled against Club Brugge just to scrape their way into the knockout phase.\nThe new arrangement also led to major clashes early on in the tournament. Bayern Munich destroyed Croatian champions Dinamo Zagreb 9-2, the heaviest defeat ever inflicted in the tournament’s history and one which would ultimately cost Zagreb their place in the playoffs on a matter of goal difference. The very same Bayern were then defeated by underdogs Aston Villa the next week, with Jhon Duran’s outstanding looping shot sending the Birmingham team into raucous celebrations.\nOne of the standout matches came when Liverpool went head to head against Real Madrid – a contest we normally would not be treated to until much later on. The tension generated by this early clash certainly inflamed the spirit of the Anfield crowd as they rose out of their seats to roar the club anthem ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone.’ A surprising penalty miss from Real Madrid star Mbappe, and solid finishes from Liverpool’s Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo, secured Liverpool the victory. Arne Slot was certainly quick to state at a press conference ‘I liked a lot what I saw’, suggesting that this new set up is serving the team well.\nMore broadly, the Red’s have demonstrated a strong performance, coasting to the top of the table with an impressive 21 points. However, defeated only by PSV Eindhoven, this near perfect run comes at an unexpected moment. With the departure of club legend Jurgen Klopp, following a disappointing end to last year’s campaign, many Liverpool fans had little hope of achieving anything fantastic in 2024/25. Yet, armed with new manager Arne Slot, they sit 9 points clear of their closest challengers, Arsenal, in the Premier League and have breezed their way to the top spot in the Champions League.\nIt will certainly be interesting to see whether they can maintain this comfortable position, as most other teams have been feeling the heat of the new reforms.\nOne student told The Oxford Student that the final day of the round, which saw an incredible 18 matches played all at once, was ‘exciting’ but also saw ‘lots of jeopardy in many games’ (Ben Harrison, St Hilda’s). Indeed, there was a lot at stake up until the very last moment, with 25 of the 36 teams still awaiting their fate at that point. TNT news, responsible for covering this grand ‘final feast’ noted that the night was record-breaking, with fans tuning in to witness 64 goals scored in one evening.",
