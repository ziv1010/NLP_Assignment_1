You’ve got to credit Spurs as well, they pushed bodies forward, got bodies in the box, and kept crossing it, but I thought United lost a bit of control when Maguire and Casemiro and then Sesko went off.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘But I think he (Amorim) will be happy in the sense they they got a goal late in the game and they are still in a decent position.\n‘There is no European football and if you look at the fixtures coming up – Everton, Palace, West Ham, Wolves – after those, they’ll be second, I think and they’ll be in a position where they can strike.\n‘If you look at that with no European football, Man Utd will finish in the top four.’\nExpanding on his thoughts, Hargreaves added: ‘They have a huge advantage. There’s only one game a week, pretty much. You think about all the other teams, Spurs and Chelsea, everybody has European football,\n‘Amorim has got time on the training pitch and he’s a great coach, we know that from his time at Sporting.\n‘Last season was tricky trying to navigate all the fixtures, but if you look at who they are going to play in the next five, six games, and the way they’ve been playing – unbeaten in five – and the squad that they have, it’s settled.’\nMore Trending\nA potential problem could emerge with the departure of Mbeumo and Amad – who combined for United’s first goal on Saturday – to the African Cup of Nations next month.\nBut Hargreaves believes United’s squad and lack of European football will go some way to mitigating the impact.\n‘That’s going to be tricky but again hopefully without so many games, they can keep the squad healthy and he can rotate players in,’ he added.\n‘Obviously, Sesko is an interesting one, they’ll need him but we’ll see what happens with that injury. But I think the squad is good and I think not having European football is a miss for the club but actually it could help them get back into that top four.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Sunderland 2-2 Arsenal: 94th minute Brobbey strike ends Gunners’ winning run\nMORE: Ruben Amorim gives Benjamin Sesko injury update after Man Utd draw at Tottenham\nMORE: Cesc Fabregas praises Mikel Arteta for transforming £32m Arsenal star",
