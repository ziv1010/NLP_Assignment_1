Stand up for the champions: Put your life’s savings on it. Manchester City will see off Chelsea to win the title for the third successive season. It would also be their fifth in six years. Pep Guardiola’s men have hit that late-season form that sees them crush every opponent in sight. And the Blues, who have not hit any sort of patch under Frank Lampard, will not be an exception.\n2. No Toney, no party? This week, the Football Association hit Ivan Toney with an eight-month ban for breach of betting rules. The first game he will be missing is Brentford’s trip to Tottenham Hotspur. How will they cope without their talismanic striker? That would play out in Saturday’s early kick-off.\n3. Arsenal’s response at Forest: Mikel Arteta was a bullish man during his Friday press conference. The Arsenal boss insisted the team could still pip City to the title and made it clear they would not bottle their last two fixtures. His players would need to back up his words when they travel to play Nottingham Forest in Saturday’s late kick-off.\n4. Brighton’s late push for Europe: Roberto De Zerbi’s men have been hot and cold in the last week or two. First, they get thrashed at home by relegation strugglers Everton. And then, they hammer Arsenal 3-0 at the Emirates. In midweek, they were swept aside 4-1 at Newcastle. But you can expect them to see off relegated Southampton at home.\n5. Newcastle in Champions League: Monday Night Football will see Newcastle host Leicester City. A win for the Magpies confirms their place in next season’s Champions League. And what an achievement it will be for Eddie Howe’s men. Under the lights at St James’ Park, you can expect them to get the job done against the Foxes, who are hoping not to go down.",
