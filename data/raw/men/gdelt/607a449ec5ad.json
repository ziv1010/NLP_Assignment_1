Both teams have relatively similar attacking game philosophies, but to win, they need a spark of magic from the team's stars.\nPSG and Barca's style of play in the Champions League this season both prioritize ball possession dominance. This is shown by an average of 65 percent of ball possession per match collected by PSG, then 58 percent belonging to Barca. This collection of statistical records is only inferior to Manchester City, the defending champion team, which recorded 71 percent of ball possession per game in the world's most prestigious club competition.\nBoth teams also played with similar tactics, 4-3-3. The key to the attack came from both wings. The factor of two coaches who came from Barcelona is the reason PSG and Barca looked like similar teams.\nPSG coach Luis Enrique is a former Barca player and coach. During his three seasons leading Barca from 2014-2017, Enrique presented a treble winner in the 2014-2015 season. Only he and Pep Guardiola could deliver epic achievements in that one season for Barca. Meanwhile, Xavi Hernandez, the current Barca coach, only won the Spanish League title and the Spanish Super Cup last season.\nAlso read: Kylian Mbappe, Real Madrid and French Interests\nFurthermore, Enrique and Xavi also worked together to guard Barca's midfield when they were still active players in the late 1990s to early 2000s. This also makes their attachment to the philosophy of football very strong.\nAhead of the first match against Xavi as a coach, Enrique boasted that he could defeat his junior. Not only aiming to achieve victory, Enrique is also determined to showcase his more mature quality and experience as a tactician compared to Xavi.\n”Xavi will not know how we play and who is playing until he sees him on the pitch. \"Our goal is to show absolute dominance in possession of the ball and score as many goals as possible,\" said Enrique as reported by L'Equipe, Tuesday (9/4/2024).\nEnrique added that he and his coaching staff have prepared the team and tactics to the best of their ability to take advantage of playing at home in the first game. However, he said that the end result of the match will be greatly determined by the performance of the players on the field.\nAlso read: PSG in Top 16 Curse Terror\n\"I have many players who can play in several different positions to perform as needed by the team. This game will be won by the players, not depending on the coaches,\" said Enrique.\nPSG will no doubt once again rely on their striker, Kylian Mbappe. This season, the young man from Paris has scored six goals in the Champions League. That brought him to the top of the competition's top scorer list with Erling Haaland (Manchester City), Antoine Griezmann (Atletico Madrid) and Harry Kane (Bayern Munich).\nThree of those goals were scored by Mbappe when he helped PSG eliminate Real Sociedad in the round of 16 with an aggregate score of 4-1. Mbappe is highly motivated to continue his productivity in the knockout phase of this season's Champions League. His great determination is solely aimed at helping PSG win their first Champions League title.\n”This is the time for the best players to show their abilities. I'm ready as usual. \"I'm sure we will give everything to win the match (against Barca),\" said Mbappe to Telefoot.\nAlso read: Xavi Hernandez's Mantra, Barcelona's Path to Revival\nXavi won't know how we play and who's playing until he sees him on the pitch.\nIn addition to Mbappe, PSG will also rely on winger Ousmane Dembele, who has knowledge of the playing style and strengths of Barca's main players. Dembele joined PSG early this season from Barca. During his tenure at Barca from 2017 to 2023, Dembele played in 185 games, contributing 40 goals.\nIlkay Guendogan, a Barcelona midfielder, believes that both teams have an equal chance of winning the first match in Paris. Guendogan also admits that the probability of winning will increase if Barcelona can control ball possession better than the home team.\n”PSG is a good team with good players. We have to control the ball extremely and defend well. \"If we can do that together as a team, we will have a chance (of winning),\" said Guendogan as reported by Marca.\nGuendogan, who led City to win the Champions League last season, emphasized that every Barca player must show a high level of focus for more than 90 minutes. If they are careless with small details, PSG could cause suffering for Barca.\nAlso read: Barcelona's Asa Rises in Europe\n\"In a moment, your situation can quickly change from being the favorite team to being eliminated. I have experienced that situation in this competition throughout my career. So, we must continue to develop and make the right decisions in key moments of the match,\" said Guendogan.\nThe caution conveyed by Guendogan is quite reasonable. This is because the \"Blaugrana\" did not perform well in four away matches in the Champions League this season. They were only able to win once at Porto's home, were held by Napoli, and then defeated in their visits to the headquarters of two weak teams, namely Shakhtar Donetsk and Antwerp.\n”We have to raise our level from the match in Napoli. We have worked on our strengths and understood their weaknesses. \"I think if we can play the match to the best of our ability, we can qualify,\" said Joao Felix, Barca striker, as quoted by Sport.\nFelix and Robert Lewandowski will be Barca's main hope to beat the PSG defense. They have each scored three goals in European club competitions.\nWriter:\nMUHAMMAD IKHSAN MAHAR |\nEditor:\nEMILIUS CAESAR ALEXEY",
