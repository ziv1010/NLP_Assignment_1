  "body_text": "Spurs start new era under 'glass half-full' Frank\n- Published\nUefa Super Cup: Tottenham v Paris St-Germain\nVenue: Bluenergy Stadium, Udine, Italy Time: 20:00 BST\nCoverage: Live radio commentary on BBC 5 Live (UK only) and live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app\nWhat is it they say about London buses?\nTottenham waited 17 years for their first trophy. By the end of Wednesday night, they could have clinched their second in three months.\nWith last season's Europa League triumph still fresh in the memory, opportunity beckons for new manager Thomas Frank to not only get his first season in charge off to a flying start, but to chalk off the first major milestone.\nOf course, success against Champions League winners Paris St-Germain is likely to have little bearing on how the next nine months develop.\nBut victory against the European champions would certainly garner immediate buy-in from players, colleagues and supporters.\nNot that Frank is having trouble in making a good first impression.\nA few days after his appointment, Frank called a first-team meeting at the club's Enfield training headquarters.\nThis is standard fare - an opportunity for 'tracksuit staff' to acquaint themselves with the new coaching team and for the manager to start laying down his philosophy.\nBut this was a gathering with a twist.\nFrank invited everyone - from the technical and non-technical staff in the building who have contact with the first-team squad to the catering, administration and cleaning staff.\nIt may have been a small gesture, but it did not go unnoticed behind the scenes.\nFrank's ethos of inclusivity\nThis kind of inclusive effort is indicative of how Frank operates.\nThose who worked with him at Brentford could recall similar anecdotes about Frank's keenness to nurture a sense of inclusivity.\nA source describes the Dane as a glass half-full type of manager. He is said to be an emotionally available individual - not necessarily a given in the unforgiving confines of professional football.\nThat is not to say his predecessor Ange Postecoglou wasn't. The gushing appraisals and messages that followed his sacking were a clear indication of the strength of feeling towards him.\nBut it has been noticeable during Frank's opening weeks in the job just how determined he is to emphasise the collective.\nAt the heart of his ethos is the notion that, regardless of position at the club, everyone should be treated the same. There should be no preferential treatment - every member of staff is part of the journey.\nHis decision to leave Yves Bissouma in London for persistent lateness before the PSG match is indicative of his straight approach. His culture is rooted in hard work and honesty, and that means being upfront with issues.\nIf someone has a problem, Frank expects that person to air it openly. He won't accept backstabbing or whispers.\nFrank is at the centre of each day's training session. He will delegate elements of daily coaching to his staff, but he is said to be the protagonist in most sessions.\nThat is a clear step away from Postecoglou's regime - where the Australian would observe most training days at the side of the pitch during the week, before taking the reins on the final session before a match.\nFrank is enthralled by details. His attention to the smallest of tactical specifics has already surprised members of the team and, even in largely meaningless pre-season friendlies, his tactical clipboard has stayed close to hand.\nFrank having significant say in transfers\nFrank's preparations, whether it be his team composition or bedding in his philosophy, have been hampered during pre-season.\nHe has been without Dominic Solanke and Destiny Udogie for much of the summer, while Dejan Kulusevski is yet to feature because of injury.\nFrank has also lost James Maddison to an ACL injury, while captain Heung-min Son has left for Los Angeles FC.\nWhile setting the tone for team spirit has been evident, Frank's long-term vision of how he wants Tottenham to play is, arguably, less clear.\nSources have indicated that summer signing Mohammed Kudus is becoming a key player for Frank, with an emerging pattern of trying to get the ball into the Ghana international as often as possible.\nFrank will also drill his team to be flexible. Don't be shocked to see him start games with a back three and finish with a four.\nThe 51-year-old is also having a significant say in the club's transfer business.\nHe is said to have been a driving force behind the deal for Kudus, while the club's efforts to sign Savinho from Manchester City are described as having Frank's seal of approval.\nNevertheless, the window hasn't been without its difficulties.\nThe high-profile pursuit of Nottingham Forest attacker Morgan Gibbs-White - and its ultimate failure owing to legal issues related to the England international's £60m release clause - was a blow.\nSpurs would also like to sign Marc Guehi, but the Crystal Palace captain prefers Liverpool as a destination.\nSo far, only Kudus and Joao Palhinha - on a season-long loan from Bayern Munich - have arrived.\nFor some supporters, that isn't enough.\nTalks of fan protests at the perceived lack of squad investment has been an unwanted narrative that has followed the club this summer, since the move for Gibbs-White fell through.\nThere is money to spend, with owners Enic understood to have injected a level of cash into the club.\nLanding Savinho and Palace attacker Eberechi Eze - who Tottenham have held talks over - would go some way to appeasing disgruntled supporters.\n\"This transfer window, we are definitely in the market and will do everything we can to make the best possible and strong squad,\" Frank added.\n\"There are a few things in the air, shall we say, along the way.\"\nRelated topics\n- Published26 July 2022",
