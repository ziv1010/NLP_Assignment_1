  "body_text": "LOS ANGELES — Searching for sure footing after a trio of defeats and the longest scoreless streak at home in all competitions since debuting in 2018, the Los Angeles Football Club resembled its dominant self Wednesday night.\nYet the team’s finishing issues persisted with a third straight goal-less effort at BMO Stadium, ending a return to league play with a 0-0 tie against Atlanta United FC in a match that saw LAFC outshoot its opponent 22-4.\nNone of Atlanta’s attempts on goal required a save by LAFC’s John McCarthy, who walked away unscathed with his fifth shutout of the season.\nMidseason MVP candidate Thiago Almada did not make an impact on the match. Neither did Atlanta’s leading scorer, Greek forward Giorgos Giakoumakis. The pair combined for a single shot as Atlanta appeared hesitant to play straight up with LAFC.\nInstead, they absorbed pressure and relied on veteran goalkeeper Brad Guzan to keep them in the game. Eight saves by the U.S. men’s national team keeper, including some he knew nothing about, stymied a hungry home team.\n“He had a great game,” McCarthy said of Guzan, who logged his 50th career shutout. “He made some saves – and he made some extra saves. I think everyone knows that he was the reason they got the result.\n“On another day maybe one or two go in and we walk out of here and everyone’s dancing as happy as can be.”\nThe league’s leading goal scorer, Denis Bouanga, pressured Atlanta all night but couldn’t find the touch he needed as four of eight attempts found the target.\nBouanga nearly headed home a goal in the second half and appeared to get kicked in the face in the process. He slammed a low shot by Guzan that ricocheted off the post in the 86th minute. And, on the final kick of the game, the French forward elevated a shot into the stands.\nLAFC captain Carlos Vela entered the match in the 59th minute and continued to slump following his ineffectual performance against Mexico’s Club León in the CONCACAF Champions League final.\nVela, however, was fouled in the box and earned a penalty kick in the 70th minute. His first try was denied by Guzan, but referee Joe Dickerson ruled that he moved off the goal line early so it was retaken. Vela skied the second chance over the crossbar.\nLAFC (7-1-5, 26 points) hoped to resume league play with a positive result as it begins a bevy of domestic matches between now and July 15.\nInstead, the club’s frustration on the field was apparent as quality chances against Atlanta (6-4-7, 25 points) went unfulfilled.\n“Judging by the performance I’d say they’re handling it quite well,” Coach Steve Cherundolo said. “I think we already digested the Champions League final. There’s no way you play a game like that tonight if you hadn’t.”\nCreating chances, being on the front foot, holding a potent offensive team like Atlanta to zero shots on goal “was positive.”\nDespite the recent struggles, there is no panic in the locker room.\n“You have ups. You have downs,” McCarthy said. “Yeah the final sucks but it was what, four, five days ago now? You can’t do anything about it so all we need to worry about now is Houston.”\nOpting to postpone several matches through its CCL run, LAFC must now cope with a packed calendar that resumes this weekend in Texas.\nWednesday marked LAFC’s 13th MLS match and 23rd overall.\nA grueling stretch leading up to their Leagues Cup participation in August could be exacerbated by two FIFA international windows over the next six weeks.\n“I’m hopeful that all of the games that involve players of ours all get canceled spontaneously so they all stay here and play,” Cherundolo joked. “That’s my hope. We’ll figure it out in the next couple of days, who’s gone, who’s not. For us, like any other club, it’s not the right time.”\nNonetheless, Bouanga (Gabon), Denil Maldonado (Honduras), Diego Palacios and Jose Cifuentes (Ecuador) were tabbed to join their respective nations from June 12-20 and will miss at least two league matches.\nMaldonado is expected to remain with Honduras for the Gold Cup group stage through July 2.\nAmericans Kellyn Acosta, Aaron Long and Timothy Tillman are on the U.S. national team’s preliminary Gold Cup roster.\nIf any LAFC players reach the Gold Cup final on July 16, they will miss as many as a half-dozen domestic games.\nMahala Opoku is included on Ghana’s U-23 roster for a trio of Africa Cup of Nations matches between June 25-30, though LAFC does not have a match during that span – making it the longest break between games from now until a trip to Minnesota on July 15.\n“When things aren’t going your way you have to take small steps forward and not just one giant step,” Cherundolo said. “Tonight, I think, was more than a small step.\n“My message to the guys was keep going. If we play like that we win a lot of games.”\nUP NEXT\nLAFC plays at Houston on Saturday at 5:30 p.m. PT.\n\"When things aren't going your way you need to take small steps forward.\"\n🎙️ Steve Cherundolo #LAFC pic.twitter.com/KKyLrYwKtI\n— LAFC (@LAFC) June 8, 2023\n\"I'm one game at a time and I think that's where we have to be.\"\n🎙️ @jmacdaddy77 #LAFC pic.twitter.com/8H70tragOD\n— LAFC (@LAFC) June 8, 2023\n\"Tonight things didn't go our way.
