  "body_text": "Alongside our fellow Premier League clubs, we will be supporting Stonewall's Rainbow Laces campaign at our game against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday to show our support for LGBTQ+ inclusion within sport.\nThis season sees the campaign celebrate its tenth anniversary with the theme of ‘Let’s Lace Up to Keep It Up’. This looks at how sport has become more inclusive over the last decade, while also highlighting the need for ongoing work to ensure sport is a safe space for members of the LGBTQ+ community.\nDuring the campaign window, which also takes in our trip to Luton Town on Tuesday, December 5, rainbow armbands will be worn by captains across all 20 games, with Rainbow Laces branding also widely visible within stadiums throughout the period.\nMeanwhile, there will also be similar shows of support when our women’s side take on Chelsea at Emirates Stadium on Sunday, December 10 in the Women’s Super League, as we stand together to ensure everyone feels welcome to be a Gooner.\nWith Gay Gooners, we are proud to have the first and the largest LGBTQ+ fan group in England, with over a thousand of members in the UK and beyond. Our supporters club exists to unite LGBTQ+ Arsenal fans and allies at both home and away fixtures, providing a safe and welcoming space for all. Gay Gooners also represents us during the annual London Pride parade every summer.\nEveryone can make a difference through conversations, understanding the stigma that still surrounds LGBTQ+ people on and off the pitch, and calling out discriminatory behaviour and sentiment when you see it.\nIf you witness either inside Emirates Stadium, you can report it to a steward or use our ‘See Something, Say Something’ service by texting “Foul” to 67777 together with a description of the incident.\nAlso, if you spot something online on one of our channels, please let us know by reporting it.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
