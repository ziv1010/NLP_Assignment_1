The Real Madrid midfielder showed no signs of tiredness having reported to international duty just weeks after lifting the Champions League trophy with Carlo Ancelotti at Wembley Stadium when he headed in England's match winner in their opening group match.\nHe has been tipped to be one of the star players in the build up to the tournament and the England man was third in the betting at 10/1 with William Hill to scoop the accolade pre-competition but has been backed into 6/1 following his winning goal against Serbia in England’s opening Group C fixture on Sunday night.\nThose odds see him climb above Kylian Mbappe (13/2) and Harry Kane (12/1) in the market – the latter drifting from 10/1 after a quiet start to the tournament – while Germany’s Toni Kroos (14/1) has also attracted early support.\nWilliam Hill's spokesperson Lee Phelps said: “Jude Bellingham really ran the show in Gelsenkirchen last night in an otherwise underwhelming England display, and his performance has seen him climb to the summit of our Player of the Tournament market.\n“The Real Madrid star was already among the frontrunners at 10/1 for the award but is now the outright favourite at 6/1 to take home the accolade, seeing him move above England teammate Harry Kane and previous favourite Kylian Mbappe.”\nEuro 2024 Player of the Tournament\n- Jude Bellingham - 6/1\n- Kylian Mbappe - 13/2\n- Harry Kane - 12/1\n- Toni Kroos - 14/1\n- Jamal Musiala - 14/1\n- Phil Foden - 14/1\n- Florian Wirtz - 16/1\n- Bar - 18/1\n18+ | Gamble responsibly | gambleaware.org | Odds subject to change | Odds from William Hill\nEuro 2024 Betting Offer\nNew British customers can enjoy £10 in free bets when they register and place £10 in bets with All British Casino during the Euros.
