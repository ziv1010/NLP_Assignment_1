  "body_text": "FC Kairat are the Champions League newcomers from Central Asia hoping to cause the mother of all upsets when they host Real Madrid.\nKairat are from the city of Almaty in south-eastern Kazakhstan, around 200 miles from the Chinese border and 3,985 miles from Madrid. The Spanish capital is closer to New York City — and the gap on the pitch is just as large.\nAdvertisement\nReal Madrid are the record 15-time winners of the competition who have won the most matches in its history (301) and boast stars including Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham. This is Kairat’s first appearance in the Champions League and their opening game against Sporting CP ended in a 4-1 defeat in Lisbon.\nHow have Kairat been preparing for the visit of one of the biggest clubs in the world? We spoke to a player, an analyst, the head groundskeeper, the press officer and a supporter turned club mainstay to find out.\nThe press officer\nKairat’s 25-year-old press officer Arman Jaxygulov had an idea when the main Champions League draw took place in Monaco last month.\nWith the team gathered in Almaty, Jaxygulov decided to film their reaction. As Real Madrid’s league-phase opponents were revealed one by one by the UEFA computer, expectation grew. “Kairat, Kairat!” one person shouts in the video, before a huge outburst of excitement when the Kazakhstani side’s name shows up on screen (‘Kairat’ means strength or fortitude in Kazakh).\nView this post on Instagram\n“Our players didn’t know I was recording, so it was true emotion,” says Jaxygulov. “Some of them were really shocked.”\nThe only other time Kairat played in the main phase of a UEFA competition, the inaugural Conference League in 2021-22, they finished bottom of their group. They progressed to the Champions League this year after winning the Kazakhstan top flight in 2024 — the season runs from March to late October or early November. But they still had to win four two-legged qualifying ties to even reach the league phase, culminating with a win on penalties against Scottish champions Celtic.\nThat has meant non-stop work for Jaxygulov, who also serves as club photographer and social media officer. It has reached another level with the visit of Madrid. Last week, they were filtering down 500 media accreditation requests from countries including Russia, Spain and Mexico to the 35 spaces left by UEFA and broadcasters for press at Almaty’s Central Stadium.\nAdvertisement\nThe 20,800 tickets they put on sale last Tuesday quickly sold out — hardly a surprise given Madrid’s appeal in the region.\n“In Kazakhstan, every fifth person is a fan of Real Madrid or Barcelona,” says Jaxygulov. “Every kid in every family has a Barcelona or Real Madrid jersey. They really like all the players, even from the second team and the third squad — they know the third goalkeeper of Real Madrid.”\nThat could lead to an intriguing dynamic in the stadium, with plenty of Madrid fans expected to travel from neighbouring countries including China to see Xabi Alonso’s galacticos. For Kairat’s promising 17-year-old forward Dastan Satpayev, who has agreed to join Chelsea next year for a reported €4m (£3.5m, $4.7m) when he turns 18, there is an extra incentive — he is a Barcelona fan.\nLocal interest in Madrid is so strong that Kairat decided not to allow fans to attend this afternoon’s UEFA Youth League under-19 game between the two clubs, fearing that an overwhelming number of supporters turning up could cause a distraction.\nThe player\nFour seasons ago, Kairat’s Brazilian forward Edmilson was playing in the Portuguese third tier with Vilaverdense, a club from Braga.\nThis month, the 28-year-old became their first Champions League goalscorer when he netted an 86th-minute consolation after coming off the bench in the 4-1 defeat at Sporting. He barely slept on the eight-and-a-half-hour flight back to Almaty. “Now, with Madrid, I have to dream again,” the striker says.\nFor UK readers:\nFC Kairat get their moment 💫\nEdmilson Santos writes club history as he volleys home their first ever Champions League goal 🚀\n📺 @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/XVA0jRVr76\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) September 18, 2025\nFor US readers:\nEdmilson with Kairat’s FIRST-EVER #UCL goal 👏 pic.twitter.com/vRzmjWeFmY\n— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) September 18, 2025\nEdmilson joined from Slovenian club Celje in June and readily admits he did not know a Kazakhstani team could play in European competition until Kairat came in for him. You can’t blame him — the former Soviet Republic only became part of UEFA in 2002 by dint of a small western part of the country being classified as Europe. Kairat are the second team from the country to reach the main phase of the Champions League after Astana in 2015-16.\nAdvertisement\nHe suffered from nosebleeds when he first arrived in Almaty due to the city’s dry air and spent around a month adapting before he could play. He thinks that could make a difference against Madrid tonight. “My body was very different, I felt like I wasn’t strong enough to compete in training,” he says.\nEdmilson hopes Kairat can hit Alonso’s side on the break and make the most of any tiredness from Saturday’s 5-2 derby defeat by Atletico Madrid and their eight-hour trip to Kazakhstan. He is excited to face his countryman Vinicius Junior but faces a fight to swap shirts with him after the game — the Brazil star’s jersey is one of the most sought-after among Kairat’s players.\nDoes he think Kairat stand a chance?\n“Three years ago, no player who was with me would have said I was going to play in the Champions League against Madrid, but we have 90 minutes,” he says. “Madrid’s level is very, very high, but here, in Kazakhstan, everything is possible.”\nThe analyst\nWhen The Athletic spoke to Kairat performance analyst Alexander Kotlyar last week, he said his focus at the time was on “analysing the opponent, planning tactical ideas, considering their strengths and weaknesses”.\nTo which the obvious question, at least before Real Madrid’s thrashing by Atletico, was: what weakness? “We hope that we will find it, but I doubt it,” Kotlyar, 42, replied with a smile.\nKotlyar works with physical data and on the team’s psychology as well as serving as an interpreter between coach Rafael Urazbakhtin and the team’s English-speaking players. He has been at the club since 2013, first working as an academy coach, so he knows what it means for Kairat to be hosting Mbappe and Co.\n“It’s a great moment in our history. Not only for the club, in the history of our country,” he says. “It’s another tempo, another rhythm — they’re players from another planet.”\nAdvertisement\nKotlyar says he and his staff will prepare in the same way they would any other match, but also admits they might shift players from their usual positions. He would not be drawn on whether this meant they would try to stifle Alonso’s side.\n“Something will happen,” he said.\nThe groundskeeper\nKairat has already hosted one set of stars this month — the Backstreet Boys performed at Almaty’s Central Stadium on September 19.\nThe club’s Ukrainian groundskeeper, Viktor Yaromenko, has been busy making sure the grass is at its very best after that gig by the U.S. group. That involved aerating the turf and applying chemicals to stop growth and prevent disease before the concert. He and his team of five — there will be five more for the day of the game — aerated the grass again afterwards and applied fertiliser, as well as mowing and brushing the pitch.\nYaromenko, 38, helped prepare the pitch at Kyiv’s Olympic Stadium for Real Madrid’s Champions League final win against Liverpool in 2018, below, and remembers watching Cristiano Ronaldo walk down the tunnel for the final time as a Madrid player before his move to Juventus that summer.\n“I know what you feel when it’s Real Madrid playing on your pitch,” says Yaromenko. “But for this city, for this country, it’s an amazing situation, (having) the best of the best clubs come to us.”\nUEFA inspected Kairat’s hybrid pitch (a mix of natural grass and synthetic fibres) last Wednesday — which is more similar to other European grounds than others in Kazakhstan. Yaromenko says the turf was damaged for the qualifying tie against Celtic in August following a Jennifer Lopez concert earlier that month, but he is pleased with its condition for tonight’s game.\n“If nobody has anything to say about the pitch, it means everything was OK,” he says.\nThe fan turned mainstay\nIf anyone is qualified to speak about Kairat’s Champions League journey, it is Adil Karim.\nAdvertisement\nThe 26-year-old is a lifelong Kairat supporter who was once part of their official ‘ultras’ group and now works for the club as their international relations manager, their main contact with UEFA and as the person responsible for dealing with FIFA’s transfer matching system (TMS) — the online platform used by clubs to process moves. He was also present for the draw in Monaco.\nOn Saturday, Karim was at the Central Stadium to help UEFA prepare the stadium with the organisation’s signage and LED advertising boards. Kairat have had to work hard to make adjustments to their 67-year-old ground to accommodate away fans, hospitality zones, and provide the media and interview zones required in European competition.\nHe is keen to point out Kairat are not here by chance. They are proud of their academy and modern training facilities — only Athletic Club and Ajax have more academy graduates in their Champions League squads than Kairat’s 12. The Chelsea-bound Satpayev scored three goals and provided an assist in Champions League qualifying. Against Sporting, their third-choice goalkeeper Sherkhan Kalmurza, 18, became the second-youngest to save a penalty in Champions League history.\nKarim is looking forward to meeting Alonso — a former Madrid player he grew up watching after his move from Liverpool — but his overwhelming feeling is one of pride that Kairat are rubbing shoulders with the elite. They will travel to three-time winners Inter in November and finish the league phase with a visit to Arsenal in January.\n“We’re also a big team,” he says. “Now, we’re also among the 36 biggest clubs in Europe. We are honoured to be one of them.”\n(Top photo: Vyacheslav Oseledko/AFP via Getty Images)",
