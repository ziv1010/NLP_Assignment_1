  "body_text": "Newcastle vs Brest: Preview, predictions and lineups\n- Newcastle face Brest in a pre-season friendly on Saturday afternoon\n- Final match for the Magpies before the 2024/25 Premier League season begins\n- Eddie Howe is missing a number of players through injury\nNewcastle United play their final pre-season friendly before the start of the Premier League campaign this Saturday when they take on French side Brest on home soil.\nThe Magpies faced Girona in another friendly at St James' Park on Friday as they look to squeeze in as much as pre-season football as humanly possible.\nIt's been a largely positive pre-season for Newcastle to date, although they ended their tour of Japan in defeat against Yokohama F. Marinos. Prior to the 2-0 loss, they had beaten Urawa Red Diamonds 4-1 and Hull City 2-0 in preparation for the 2024/25 season.\nBrest were surprise Champions League qualifiers last term - the first time they have qualified for a UEFA competition - but have only won one of their five pre-season games. However, a 2-2 draw with Juventus last time out shows it will be no walkover for Newcastle this weekend.\nHere is 90min's preview of Newcastle's clash with Brest.\nWhat time does Newcastle vs Brest kick-off?\n- Location: Newcastle, England\n- Stadium: St James' Park\n- Date: Saturday 10 August\n- Kick-off Time: 16:00 BST / 11:00 ET / 08:00 PT\nNewcastle vs Brest H2H Record\nNewcastle and Brest have never clashed in a competitive fixture.\nCurrent form (all competitions)\nHow to watch Newcastle vs Brest on TV and live stream\nNewcastle team news\nNewcastle have a number of injuries heading into the new season, with centre-back duo Jamaal Lascelles and Sven Botman out until the end of the calendar year. Callum Wilson and Matt Targett are closing in on a return but will miss Saturday's friendly, while Lewis Miley is still some way off returning.\nAnthony Gordon and Kieran Trippier have now returned to training after representing England at Euro 2024 and Eddie Howe has insisted they are likely to feature this weekend.\nDue to Friday's friendly with Girona, Howe is likely to make significant changes to his lineup for the Brest clash, with new signing William Osula potentially getting some minutes.\nNewcastle predicted lineup vs Brest\nNewcastle predicted lineup vs Brest (4-3-3): Pope; Trippier, Krafth, Burn, Hall; Joelinton, White, J. Miley; Almiron, Osula, Gordon.\nBrest team news\nThere are unlikely to be too many names familiar to Newcastle supporters in the Brest side, although Jordan Amavi, Pierre Lees-Melou and Karamoko Dembele all have experience in British football.\nAmavi has arrived as a strong squad option from Marseille this summer and manager Eric Roy has also seen Ludovic Ajorque sign on loan from Mainz. The 6'5 French centre-forward is one to watch on Saturday.\nBrest predicted lineup vs Newcastle\nBrest predicted lineup vs Newcastle (4-1-3-2): Coulder; Lala, Chardonnet, N'Diaye, Amavi; Magnetti; Del Castillo, Martin, Camara; Ajorque, Le Douaron.\nNewcastle vs Brest score prediction\nThe result of this one may hinge significantly on Newcastle's lineup choice but the Magpies should have enough depth to field a strong side following Friday's match. With the influential Trippier and Gordon returning, Newcastle should secure another pre-season win.\nHowever, Brest are likely to make life difficult for the Magpies, with tight pre-season matches against Serie A giants Napoli and Juventus recently.",
