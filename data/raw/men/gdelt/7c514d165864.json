Liverpool’s next transfer target may have become blatantly clear after Italy mounted a 2-1 comeback win over Albania at the 2024 Euros.\nNo, no – we’re not talking about Federico Chiesa (great player though). No, no – we’re not on about Nicolo Barella either (wow, though).\nDrop everything and feast your eyes on every inch of Bologna’s 6′ 2″ behemoth in Riccardo Calafiori.\nIt’s perhaps a bit too early for @StatmanDave to be comparing the Roma-born footballer to Alessandro Nesta, but boy oh boy can we get on board with the enthusiasm after his performance last night.\nRiccardo Calafiori's game by numbers vs. Albania:\n100% aerial duels won\n100% dribbles completed\n100% tackles won\n99 passes completed\n93% pass accuracy\n3 interceptionsThe NEXT Alessandro Nesta. 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹 pic.twitter.com/PPTtgqZ9vK\n— Statman Dave (@StatmanDave) June 15, 2024\nFollow Empire of the Kop on Instagram (@empireofthekop) HERE\nAllesandro Bastoni and Barella got on the scoresheet to ensure Luciano Spalletti’s men got off on the right foot in Group B.\nWho is Riccardo Calafiori?\nThe 22-year-old centre-back is a Roma youth product who has so far enjoyed spells with I Giallorossi, Genoa (loan) and Basel (permanent transfer) before returning to the Serie A with Bologna.\nCalafiori has a history of playing down the left flank but has since enjoyed perhaps his best football playing as a left-sided centre-back for Thiago Motta’s former outfit.\nBreaking the Lines describe the footballer as the following: “He could be considered a perfect hybrid of a wing-back, centre-back, and midfielder, making him an ideal defender in the modern game.”\nIntriguingly for Liverpool: “In Motta’s system, Calafiori played on the left side of a three-man defence. He had an immense physical presence: tall, strong, and a good reader of the game. He was very calm and composed in defence even when under pressure.\n“As a defender, he was great, but what made him stand out was his ability on the ball. Calafiori had a great range of passing and showcased various styles of passing. This led to him completing 1600 passes, 76 accurate long balls, creating 17 chances, and getting 5 assists. He also had impressive ball progression skills, taking on players in his own half and dribbling through them using his strength and speed.”\nIt gets even better. The 22-year-old posted some impressive aerial duel numbers in 2023/24, winning 71.4% of his aerial duels last term, according to FBref. Not a bad figure when compared to the gold standard of word football in Virgil van Dijk (average of 76%).\nHow much is Riccardo Calafiori?\nGazzetta Dello Sport (via Sport Witness) claimed back in March this year that the centre-back had risen in value to €25m (£21.1m).\nGoodness knows just how much Calafiori will be worth after last night’s performance – or after the Euros entirely!\nSafe to say that Liverpool and any other interested party should be leaving a little extra aside if they wish to land the defender’s signature this summer.\nWhen does Riccardo Calafiori’s contract expire?\nThe versatile defender’s current terms with Bologna are set to expire in the summer of 2027.\nAre Liverpool interested in Riccardo Calafiori?\nIf there are any links between Liverpool and Calafiori – they’re slim.\nThe No.33 has seen himself linked with the likes of Tottenham, Juventus (particularly now that ex-boss Thiago Motta has moved to the Old Lady), Napoli, Manchester United… basically anyone but Arne Slot’s Reds!\nAdmittedly, we’ve not had the best of luck with Italian nationals in recent years. Cough cough… Fabio Borini, Alberto Aquilani, Mario Balotelli… cough cough.\nSooner or later, though, our luck will shift in that regard. If any player looks set to break that trend, it looks like it could very well be Riccardo Calafiori.\nThink about it, Liverpool. Just think about it.\nEOTK Close-up with John Welsh: ‘a local lad who lived his dream’ and Slot’s LFC predictions",
