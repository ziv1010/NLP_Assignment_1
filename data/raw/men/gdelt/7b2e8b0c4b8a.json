The winner of each will progress to the group stage, where eight top-seeded clubs await.\nAfter an illustrious recent history of hosting high-profile regional and international football matches and competitions, Saudi Arabia’s hosting credentials will also come to fore once again. This follows the successful hosting of the West Asian Football Federation Women’s Championship in February in the Kingdom, along with the growth of the Women’s Premier League ahead of its third season.\nAmongst those aiming to make their mark on the continental stage is Al Nassr, winners of the 2023/24 Saudi Arabian Women’s Premier League. Having qualified for the tournament’s preliminary phase, Al Nassr will represent the Kingdom against some of Asia’s best teams – facing Group A clashes against Myawady Women FC, Young Elephants FC, and Abu Dhabi Country Club for a place in the next round.\nAl Nassr will compete in the preliminary round, with all Group A fixtures taking place in Riyadh from 25 to 31 August, marking a historic moment for Saudi Arabian women’s football with the first AFC Women’s Champions League matches to be held in the Kingdom.\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
