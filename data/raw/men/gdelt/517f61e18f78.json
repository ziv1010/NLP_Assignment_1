  "body_text": "Rashford bags first Barca goals to seal win at Newcastle\nNEWCASTLE, United Kingdom (AFP)-Marcus Rashford scored his first goals for Barcelona as the England forward’s brilliant brace inspired a 2-1 win against Newcastle in the Champions League on Thursday.\nRashford struck twice in the space of nine minutes in the second half at St James’ Park to make a memorable return to England following his loan move from Manchester United in July.\nThe 27-year-old’s first goals in the Champions League since 2021 will have made for painful viewing for United fans, whose team have no European football this season and are already mired in a dismal start to the Premier League campaign.\nAnthony Gordon got one back for Newcastle in the closing stages but it was too late to salvage a point in their Champions League group phase opener.\nRashford fell out of favour with United boss Ruben Amorim last season and was sent on loan to Aston Villa in the second half of the campaign before being exiled to Barcelona for the whole of this term.\nOnce feted as the future of English football after emerging from United’s youth academy as a precocious teenager, Rashford’s career has dipped badly in recent years amid claims he is longer focused on his career.\nBut Rashford’s vibrant performance on Tyneside suggested he could be about to embark on a long-awaited renaissance with Barcelona.\nRashford has often made a habit of tormenting Newcastle and it was his seventh career goal against the Magpies.\nOff to a solid start in La Liga with three wins from four games, Barcelona were without Spain forward Lamine Yamal, who was sidelined for Sunday’s 6-0 victory against Valencia with a groin injury.\nBut Rashford’s double ensured Yamal wasn’t missed by Hansi Flick’s team.\nBeaten by Inter Milan in last season’s Champions League semi-finals, Barcelona haven’t reached the final since they last lifted the trophy in 2015.\nBut the five-time European champions are expected to be among the leading contenders this season and this was a strong start to their challenge.\nThe defeat punctured Newcastle’s hopes of making a strong start on their return to the Champions League after they failed to make it out of the group stage in 2023-24.",
