  "body_text": "The domestic transfer window is open, and Premier League clubs are once again scouring the market. One place they are sure to look is Spain, with plenty of La Liga players having already attracted attention from English clubs.\nSo, from a promising Real Valladolid right-back to a dynamic winger at Athletic Bilbao, The Athletic’s Spanish football experts take you through the 10 La Liga players your club should be trying to sign, grouping them by their suitability to Champions League-chasing sides, mid-table clubs and the teams towards the bottom end of the Premier League.\nAdvertisement\nChampions League chasers\nIvan Fresneda (Real Valladolid, right-back, 18)\nValladolid may have been relegated to the second division, but last season took Fresneda’s profile to new heights.\nThe right-back was one of the few bright sparks for the team owned by Ronaldo Nazario. He made 22 La Liga appearances and drew widespread praise for his defensive performance against Real Madrid’s Vinicius Junior in a 2-0 defeat in December. It was no surprise, then, when Arsenal, Newcastle United and Borussia Dortmund all showed interest in January.\nGO DEEPER\nTracked by Arsenal and Dortmund at 18 – La Liga prospect Ivan Fresneda on his future\nFresneda’s release clause is €20million (£17m; $22m) — it could have risen to €40m if Valladolid had stayed in La Liga — and this price point, along with his youth and personality, has attracted the attention of many big clubs in Spain and abroad.\nHe recently changed his representation from EPIC Sports to Lian Sports, who have very good relations with Barcelona. Xavi’s team were due to meet with his representatives this week, but the meeting was cancelled. As well as Dortmund following him for a while, several Serie A teams are interested too, in particular Juventus and AC Milan.\nGuillermo Rai\nTakefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad, winger, 22)\nReal Sociedad has become the place for former Real Madrid youngsters to relaunch their careers in recent years. Martin Odegaard enjoyed a fruitful spell on loan there in the 2019-20 season before joining Arsenal, and Kubo has earned a similar place in fans’ hearts since moving from the Spanish capital to San Sebastian last year.\nKubo did not make a senior appearance for Madrid in the three years he spent there, but he is starting to show why they might have made a mistake in letting him go. The 22-year-old Japan winger helped the Basque club qualify for the Champions League with a fine season in which he scored nine goals and provided four assists, dazzling with his nimbleness in attack.\nIt is easy to pick a standout performance from Kubo — a hugely effective 76 minutes against Real Sociedad’s Basque rivals Athletic Bilbao in January in which he nutmegged centre-back Dani Vivian before scoring and then won a penalty for Mikel Oyarzabal to seal a 3-1 win. Kubo’s shirtless celebration after his goal showed that La Real mean as much to him as he does to them after years of not quite finding his feet at several clubs across La Liga.\nAdvertisement\nKubo was sent on loan to Real Mallorca (twice), Villarreal and Getafe after joining Madrid in 2019, but never found consistency during any of those spells. He first moved to Spain with Barcelona as a 10-year-old but was forced to leave when the Catalans were found to have breached FIFA regulations on signing young players. Now it seems as if last season could be a turning point for the man once nicknamed the ‘Japanese Messi’ after he enjoyed his most productive campaign in front of goal.\nTomás Hill López-Menchero\nGabri Veiga (Celta Vigo, midfielder, 21)\nIf you’re looking for perfection in possession, Veiga isn’t your man. Then again, Celta Vigo would probably have been relegated last season were it not for the midfielder occasionally deciding to put his head down and run through walls for his hometown club.\nThat was exactly what Veiga did when he put Celta ahead against Barcelona and scored a second with a cross-shot to ensure his team’s La Liga survival on the final day of the campaign. The tears that followed his substitution that night suggested he might have played his last game for Celta, with bigger sides interested in the Spain Under-21 international.\nGO DEEPER\n50 to watch - Gabri Veiga: Celta Vigo's homegrown hero who is too good to stick around\nFew players in La Liga were so direct with the ball at their feet last term, particularly given how little time Veiga had in possession. He finished in the bottom seven per cent of all midfielders in Europe’s big five leagues for touches, but the frequency of his touches in the penalty area, take-ons, shots and goals were all comfortably in the top 11 per cent.\nIn short: when Veiga has possession, he almost always looks for a way to goal.\nA fine strike against Real Betis in October encapsulated the 21-year-old’s game. Receiving the ball on the half-turn, the first thought on Veiga’s mind was to spin away from pressure and drive forward.\nVeiga did not hesitate after bursting through two challenges, taking on an early shot that took goalkeeper Rui Silva completely by surprise…\nThis well-struck low drive was one of his four goals from distance — the joint-most in La Liga last season — and it helped Veiga overperform his expected goals (xG) by 4.9. Further proof of his finishing ability.\nAdvertisement\nVeiga can be slightly rough around the edges. Yet, for confidence and power, few can match his attacking efficiency at such a young age.\nSign Veiga and give him license to maraud down the right-hand side. He is sure to deliver.\nThom Harris\nNico Williams (Athletic Bilbao, winger, 20)\nJust two years on from his La Liga debut, Athletic Bilbao winger Nico Williams has established himself as one of the best emerging talents in Spanish football. The question now is whether or when to take the next step to a Premier League club capable of challenging for Champions League football.\nStill just 20, Williams is a tricky, direct forward who loves to get on the ball and run at his marker. The only players in Europe’s top leagues who made more than his season tally of 200 take-ons were Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior, as highlighted in The Athletic’s series of the most exciting young players in Europe and beyond.\nGO DEEPER\n50 to watch: Nico Williams - the ambitious winger with an expiring contract\nThere is end product too: Williams scored six goals and provided four assists in 36 La Liga games during 2022-23, while his ability to unlock defences meant then-Spain coach Luis Enrique used him in all four games at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\nWilliams and those around him have big decisions to make this summer, with just 12 months left on his Athletic contract. There is a big family pull to remain at San Mames, where his elder brother Inaki is one of the dressing room leaders, but Williams and those around him know there is interest from the Premier League, including Unai Emery at Aston Villa.\nDermot Corrigan\nMid-table clubs\nGiorgi Mamardashvili (Valencia, goalkeeper, 22)\nMamardashvili emerged as one of the most promising goalkeepers in Europe last season. He was unbeatable in Valencia’s 1-0 win against Real Madrid last month and scouts from Crystal Palace, West Ham United and now-relegated Leicester City were regularly at the Mestalla throughout last season’s campaign to watch him. The player’s agents as well as Valencia are open to him moving on, as they discussed in a meeting held at the end of the season.\nAdvertisement\nHis age, height (6ft 6in; 199cm) and impressive performances have led to interest from not only the Premier League but Atletico Madrid, Serie A and the Portuguese Primeira Liga. Mamardashvili’s buy-out clause was raised to €100million when he renewed his contract in September, but he is expected to leave for considerably less.\nNo offers have come in for Mamardashvili yet, but he is relaxed about the situation, wanting to go to a club where he is first choice.\nValencia plucked Mamardashvili from relative obscurity when they signed him from Georgian side Dinamo Tbilisi in 2021. Since then, he has made 63 appearances in all competitions and was one of the main reasons why they avoided relegation last term.\nGuillermo Rai\nAlex Baena (Villarreal, attacking midfielder, 21)\nIf you are a casual observer of Spanish football, you are likely to know Baena’s name for the wrong reasons.\nVillarreal’s 21-year-old attacking midfielder was punched in the face by Real Madrid’s Federico Valverde in April following a La Liga match between the sides at the Santiago Bernabeu. Sources close to Valverde, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships, alleged that Baena had previously insulted the Uruguayan, referencing the child he is expecting with his wife. It’s something Baena has strongly denied.\nHaving returned from a season-long loan at Girona in 2021-22, the Spain Under-21 international — who loves a long shot — scored 12 goals and provided three assists across all competitions last season. He was a key part of the reason Villarreal finished fifth and qualified for the Europa League, despite the club swapping Emery for the radically different Quique Setien as manager in October, after Emery’s departure for Aston Villa.\nAdept at playing as a winger or as an attacking midfielder, Baena came through Villarreal’s youth system and turned down an offer from Real Madrid as a youngster. He could be given another opportunity to join Spanish football’s elite — sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their positions, have told The Athletic that Baena is one of the players being monitored by Barcelona. His stock will likely rise further if he produces an impressive showing at the Under-21 European Championships, which start today.\nTomás Hill López-Menchero\nAdvertisement\nYoussef En-Nesyri (Sevilla, striker, 26)\nEn-Nesyri’s return to his best form over recent months looks to be excellent timing for both the Morocco international and his club ahead of this summer’s transfer window.\nEn-Nesyri’s well-taken double against Manchester United and fine strike against Juventus were key as Sevilla progressed to another Europa League final — and he played his part as they beat Roma for a record-extending seventh title.\nThat followed En-Nesyri playing a key role up front as Morocco made a surprising but deserved run to the semi-finals at last year’s World Cup, with the striker netting key goals against Canada in the group stage and Portugal in the quarter-finals.\nThis could be the moment the 26-year-old makes the Premier League move which has often appeared close in recent years. He turned down potential €40million transfers to Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Ham in the summer of 2021, and the London side again showed interest in January.\nSevilla’s difficult financial situation means a sale could suit both parties. Monchi’s awkward exit to Aston Villa could provide En-Nesyri with another reason to leave, as the sporting director played a big part in taking the striker to the Estadio Sanchez Pizjuan and was admired by the Moroccan.\nThe coming weeks will show whether En-Nesyri is tempted by the significant pay rise a move to the Premier League team would bring, or if he again prefers to stay and have a crack at the Champions League with Sevilla.\nDermot Corrigan\nLower-table sides\nAleix Garcia (Girona, midfielder, 25)\nGarcia may not play for one of La Liga’s biggest sides, but he produced some of the best football in the Spanish top-flight last season.\nHe was the beating heart of an exciting Girona team who had just been promoted but were fearless in their approach in La Liga. The midfielder, who played for Manchester City from 2015-2020, constantly found dangerous positions across the pitch while looking to play incisive passes through to his team-mates.\nWhile a hamstring injury broke Garcia’s stride, his numbers were excellent across the campaign.\nOnly two players in La Liga provided more than his 2.3 key passes per game, while nobody crossed the ball as often, or with as much consistent success, as the 25-year-old. Few players can whip the ball into the penalty area with the same venom and accuracy as Garcia, who created 42 chances from set pieces.\nAdvertisement\nGarcia is not the first City-trained player to have ended up at Girona —they are part of the City Football Group — but his story is different. He was released by the Premier League side in 2020 and played in Romania before returning to Spain with Eibar a year later.\nHe might take some convincing, but prying Garcia from Girona could be a shrewd move for any side looking to add a tempo-setting midfielder to their possession-based system.\nThom Harris\nLucas Boye (Elche, striker, 27)\nWhat would Boye bring to any potential suitors? A consistent supply of goals. Since the Argentinian striker joined Elche in 2021, he has scored at an average rate of seven goals a season despite his side largely struggling and finishing bottom last campaign.\nBoye’s release clause has dropped from €25million to €15m because of Elche’s relegation, but they would be willing to let him leave for less. Four La Liga teams have shown an interest, including Getafe and Girona. He is likely to stay in Spain given he wants to continue playing in a top European league — which is why he has not been tempted by approaches from teams in the Middle East.\nBoye would provide a sense of security up front for a Premier League team that signs him; he holds the ball up well and is solid in his decision-making when waiting for the right moment to offload to team-mates.\n“I really like contact with the ball and being able to face up to the opposition,” he told the Spanish newspaper El Pais last year. “I don’t want to be isolated from the game. I’m not the kind of No 9 who waits for that opportunity in the box.”\nGuillermo Rai\nJavi Galan (Celta Vigo, left-back, 28)\nThere is no shortage of talented left-backs in La Liga, but few get the job done as quietly or as consistently as Galan.\nAmid interest from Champions League-chasing sides, the 28-year-old sealed a switch to Celta Vigo in 2021 after a stellar campaign for relegated Huesca. It seemed a bargain back then — and it was confirmed once more by Galan’s impressive performances last season.\nAdvertisement\nA tenacious defender, he led the way for “true” tackles among La Liga full-backs, a metric that combines successful tackles with fouls and failed challenges to provide an indication of how often a player attempts to win the ball.\nThe 2022-23 season was also the second in succession in which Galan completed more than 100 tackles — the only player in the Spanish top flight to have done so in both those campaigns.\nIn attack, Galan’s short and stocky build makes him an effective battering ram down the left-hand side. Only new Real Madrid signing and former Rayo Vallecano full-back Fran Garcia carried the ball into the final third more often last season, while Vinicius Jr was the only player to take on more players with one-vs-one dribbles.\nConfident on the ball and secure off it, he is a constant threat down the flank.\nGalan seems to be available for an affordable fee this summer and would be a solid option for any team looking for some forward thrust from full-back.\nThom Harris\n(Top photos: Getty Images, Quality Sport Images)",
