  "body_text": "Enzo Maresca appeared to suggest that Chelsea fans played a part in Ipswich Town’s second goal as the Blues drew 2-2 in the Premier League.\nThe Blues welcomed the Tractor Boys to Stamford Bridge on Sunday, hoping to claim an easy three points as they bid to qualify for the Champions League.\nBut it was the relegation-threatened side who were on top in the first-half, opening a two goal lead through scoring twice through Julio Enciso and Ben Johnson.\nChelsea hit back immediately after the break thanks to an Axel Tuanzebe own goal before Jadon Sancho’s late stunner ensured the points were shared.\nThe result temporarily moves Maresca’s side into fifth but they will drop out of the UCL spots if Newcastle beat Manchester United.\nIpswich’s second goal started when under-fire goalkeeper Robert Sanchez opted to pump the ball long rather than play it short, against Maresca’s tactics.\nHowever, the Italian head coach defended his keeper and seemed to imply that the jeers from Chelsea supporters and ‘environment’ inside Stamford Bridge caused Sanchez to panic and make the mistake.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

Then when they scored the first goal, the game completely changed,’ Maresca said in his post-match press conference.\n‘The dynamic of the game, I think for 20-25 minutes until the first half, we were not good enough, especially defensively, because the two goals we conceded were from our mistake.\n‘I think we lost a little bit of confidence, because we conceded, probably because of the environment. This is the moment that you have to continue doing the right things and don’t change the plan.\n‘Also because we are a team that most of the time, our goal kick will start from playing short.\n‘The second goal, we decide to play long, because the environment is there, and we concede the second one. You have to be strong, you have to continue with the things that you are doing.\n‘But I can understand, because probably we conceded the goal, and they decided to play a long ball. But sometimes, I said many times, sometimes you go long, it doesn’t mean that you are going to control something. The second goal we conceded is for that.’\nAmid a difficult run of form, Chelsea fans have upped their scrutiny of Maresca and his players, especially Sanchez who has greatly struggled since joining from Brighton in 2023.\nMore Trending\n‘In terms of fans, I said many times, we are stronger with our fans, we are a better team,’ when asked about the jeers.\n‘It’s up to them to decide the way. For sure today, probably, with the 0-1, 0-2, it’s normal to be the way they were.\n‘I didn’t say that the environment is an issue for us, because I always said that with our fans, with us, we are a better team. They have been there all season, all the way.\n‘For sure today, in the moment that we are in a difficult moment, you can expect them that they are not happy, but in the same moment, probably it’s the moment that we need the players, especially the players that are inside the pitch, it’s the moment that they probably need more support.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: When can Liverpool win the Premier League title?
