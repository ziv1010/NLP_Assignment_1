  "body_text": "Between the March international break and an FA Cup weekend, it feels as though it’s been 84 years since Liverpool Football Club last played a game of football, but they’re back in action on Wednesday under the lights at Anfield when they welcome local rivals Everton.\nArne Slot On Liverpool “Mental Break” and Return to Action vs. Everton\nLiverpool look to get back to winning ways when they take on Everton in the Premier League after two-and-a-half weeks without club football.\nWhen last we left Arne Slot’s Reds they were 12 points up with nine games to play in the 2024-25 season but everyone was feeling a little deflated by defeat in the League Cup final and being knocked out of the Champions League in the Round of 16 by Paris Saint-Germain.\nAfter two-and-a-half weeks away, though, it’s time to re-focus on the good. Namely that Arne Slot’s Reds are 12 points up with nine to play and look set for a coronation march en route to their 20th league title to draw back level with historic rivals Manchester United.\n“It’s been 15 or 16 days since I last managed a game,” Slot reflected at his pre-match press conference today. “I think that everybody can understand the position we are in now at the moment and that we are all looking so much forward to these upcoming nine games.\n“The players are refreshed, but it wasn’t all negative before. We played a final against a very good Newcastle team and had one great game and in the other defended really well against Paris Saint-Germain—the best game in the Champions League this year in my opinion.\n“So now the mental break comes more from that you go to a different environment with different teammates. For that reason, it was maybe a good moment—if you stay at your club you have to win the next game, but if you go to your national team things are new again.”\nOf course, while the break may feel something of a reset, now that Liverpool’s players are back and preparing for matchweek 30, it doesn’t really change the feeling that after tough results against Newcastle and PSG they really do have to win this one against Everton.\nA 12-point lead with nine games to go should be safe, but the two-and-a-half week break they’ve had will feel like less of a re-set and the mood could quickly turn nervy if the Reds come out of it looking lethargic and chasers Arsenal can cut it to nine with eight to play.\n“In the final stages of the season every game matters,” Slot added. “These games are very important for us, the upcoming nine, starting with the following one and that’s Everton. Not only because it’s the Merseyside derby, but also because we are in such a great position.”",
