  "body_text": "At last, a goalkeeper!\nThe Athletic’s series of articles looking at the best young prospects in England has focused on attacking players who have caught the eye. However, this week, a record-breaking goalkeeper at Arsenal is the focus.\nIt can be difficult for young keepers to break through at first-team level. After all, they are competing for just one place and often experience is preferred.\nAdvertisement\nBut every keeper has to start somewhere, and teenager Jack Porter has already received first-team recognition from Mikel Arteta.\nThe player\nName: Jack Porter\nClub: Arsenal\nDate of birth: July 15, 2008 (17)\nPosition: Goalkeeper\nThe backstory\nPorter has already sprung to prominence at Arsenal.\nWhen he made his first-team debut in the Carabao Cup against Bolton Wanderers in September 2024, Porter became the youngest goalkeeper in Arsenal’s history and their second-youngest player. At 16 years and 72 days, he is only behind team-mate Ethan Nwaneri, but he is the youngest to start a senior game.\nHe had only signed scholarship forms at Arsenal in the summer of 2024, but has regularly played up in ages and was drafted into the first team for the Champions League tie against Atalanta a week before he was given his debut, following an injury to David Raya and backup Neto being cup-tied.\nPorter joined Arsenal aged 12 in 2020, having started playing for Gidea Park Rangers in Romford, Essex.\nAlthough still only 17, he has played for England in the pathway system from under-16s through to under-19s. He was part of the under-16s side that won the Football Federations Cup in Spain in 2023.\nEarlier this season, he was the first-choice keeper for Neil Ryan’s England Under-17s for the World Cup in Qatar. England were beaten 4-0 in the last 16 by Austria.\nPorter has named team-mate Raya and Germany international Manuel Neuer as the keepers who have influenced him the most. Neuer is renowned for his ability with the ball at his feet, and Porter is also highly regarded for his distribution.\nWhat we saw\nThe nature of the goalkeeper’s role is that, in a good side, they can have few opportunities to shine, but on the occasions they are called into action, they need to be focused and ready.\nSo, The Athletic watched Porter over two fixtures, Arsenal under-18s’ 2-1 home defeat by Leicester City and the under-21s’ 1-0 win over Burnley earlier last week.\nAdvertisement\nIn the first game, Porter produced a superb reaction save with his forearm to push a Lorenz Hutchinson effort from close range away, prompting applause from his team-mates and impressed opponents.\nHe was given very little chance with Leicester’s opener as a defensive error allowed Hutchinson in on goal and Porter had come out of his area to link play between his defenders. While Porter scrambled back into position, Hutchinson got to the loose ball first and clipped his finish past the keeper.\nPorter could do little to stop Leicester’s late winner as the visitors broke swiftly and Hugo De Lisle struck a fierce shot into the roof of the net.\nIn total, Porter faced five shots on target in the game, but it was his distribution and willingness to play as an 11th outfield player that stood out.\nHe completed 48 of 51 passes and was willing to play forward and longer with plenty of them. There were 27 accurate passes beyond his own third of the pitch from 29 attempts.\nPorter had a quieter night when he stepped up to play for Arsenal Under-21s as they bounced back from a 7-0 drubbing the previous week at Liverpool with a 1-0 win over Burnley. Porter was one of eight changes, and Arsenal dominated, with Porter having just one shot on target to save.\nHe was called into action to punch a high ball into the six-yard box away in the first half and made a near-post block 10 minutes into the second period, and comfortably gathered a tame last-minute shot.\nHis main contribution throughout the evening was with the ball at his feet again, and he often came out of his area to act as a third central defender when in possession and was comfortable to play passes into midfielders’ feet while Burnley pressed.\nPorter is obviously highly regarded at Arsenal, hence his rapid promotion to the first team, and while these two games may not have presented the best opportunities for him to showcase his potential, Porter does seem to be one to watch in the future.",
