He is our player. The club make the decision on his future.\n\"I don't know what that will be. Of course I have a preferred outcome. I want the best and the strongest squad possible, but I also want players that really want to play for this football club.\"\nIsak missed Newcastle's pre-season tour of Asia with a \"minor thigh injury\", but the 25-year-old went on to train alone at former club Real Sociedad.\nHowe previously warned no player could expect to act \"poorly and train with the group as normal\", but he made it clear that he would like Isak \"to be playing today\".\nHowe was asked what would have to change for that to happen.\n\"That's not for me to answer,\" he added. \"That's for him to answer.\"\nGordon 'should be OK' to face Villa\nIt fell to Anthony Gordon to lead the line in Isak's continued absence for Newcastle's final friendly of the summer against Atletico.\nAnd there were some anxious faces on the bench after the winger went down with an ankle issue late on.\nThe England international had to come off in the closing stages and went straight down the tunnel for treatment with a club physio.\nBut Howe said Gordon \"should be OK\" for the opening day clash against Aston Villa.\nAlthough that will come as a relief to Newcastle, it was a timely reminder of how thin on the ground the club are in attack with William Osula and Sean Neave the only natural alternatives.\nGordon pressed and harried throughout, but it took Newcastle until the 34th minute to have a shot on target after Kieran Trippier saw a free-kick parried by former Atletico team-mate Jan Oblak.\nIt was as close as Newcastle came to scoring and Howe clearly needs another focal point up front - regardless of what happens with Isak.\nCallum Wilson may not have found the net in the Premier League last season, but the striker was a valued squad member, who has not been replaced since.\nHowe pushes for deals\nAtletico do not have such concerns.\nManager Diego Simeone had the luxury of naming Alexander Sorloth and Antoine Griezmann among his substitutes on Saturday. For context, the pair scored a combined 41 goals for the Spanish giants last season.\nJulian Alvarez lined up from the off and the former Manchester City striker went on to open the scoring, finishing a clinical breakaway in the 50th minute.\nSubstitute Griezmann doubled the visitors' advantage with a clever flick midway through the second half.\nThe presence of Griezmann and Co in front of a sellout crowd felt like a taster of the Champions League nights to come at St James' this season.\nThe prospect of Simeone and Newcastle assistant Jason Tindall sharing the touchline on the big stage would certainly be box office.\nNewcastle have work to do to be equipped for those sorts of occasions, but Howe remains \"hopeful\" of making new signings, with the club interested in AC Milan defender Malick Thiaw and Brentford striker Yoane Wissa.\nElanga makes home debut\nIt has been a frustrating window for Newcastle, who have missed out on a host of targets up.\nBut Saturday gave supporters a first sighting of Anthony Elanga in a black and white shirt on home soil.\nAlthough Newcastle have been knocked back by Benjamin Sesko, Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro and James Trafford, Sweden international Elanga \"just knew\" that a move to Tyneside was the \"right choice\".\nSo what will Elanga bring?\nWell, there were one or two glimpses of Elanga's one-v-one ability after Newcastle started to strategically get the ball out to the winger in the final 10 minutes of the first half.\nThe crowd took a breath in expectation as Elanga raced past Atletico Madrid defender Matteo Ruggeri down the right only to see his attempted cross hooked away.\nThen, just a couple of minutes later, Elanga again had the beating of Ruggeri, but Oblak claimed the cross.\nElanga will ultimately be judged on his end product, but it is not hard to see how the new arrival will slot into this side.\nHowe would certainly love to make one or two further additions before the season starts next week.\nLatest Stories\n-\nThe Accra Mandate: Securing Africa’s AI Future through Local Data and Ethical Governance\n3 minutes -\nAquafresh donates to National Chief Imam ahead of Ramadan\n29 minutes -\nAdopt a mix of bond and short-term finance to address financing challenges in cocoa industry – Professor Peprah to government\n31 minutes -\nNSA introduces dual authentication system for 2025/26 enrolment exercise\n2 hours -\nFuel prices to increase from Feb. 16, influenced by cedi’s depreciation\n2 hours -\nGNFS to launch automated fire safety compliance system to modernise regulation\n2 hours -\nNALAG president commends Local Gov’t Minister for payment of assembly members’ allowances\n2 hours -\nIs having a physical security operations center in your business worth it?\n2 hours -\nAsiedu Nketia recounts fierce political wars in Ajumako-Enyan-Essiam constituency\n2 hours -\nNRSA sets up committee to probe road crashes involving Toyota Voxy\n3 hours -\nCocoa farmers decry the adverse impact of producer price cut on livelihoods\n3 hours -\nFamilies who lose relatives to ‘no bed syndrome’ must sue health facilities – Dr. Nawaane\n3 hours -\nGhana Sports Fund: Dr. David Kofi Wuaku outlines vision for Youth Empowerment growth through sports\n3 hours -\nNUGS President urges sustainable digital governance\n3 hours -\nNational Investment Bank kicks off Ghana Sports Fund with landmark seed donation\n3 hours",
