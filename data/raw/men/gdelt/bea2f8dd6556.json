Representatives from both teams were in attendance, along with officials from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).\nThe match will be the fifth and penultimate fixtures for each side in Group B of the preliminary phase in this year’s ACL Two.\nThe pair are currently the top two squads on their division table with nine points apiece, with Taawoun in first place on a superior goal difference. Air Force SC of Iraq follow in third with six points while Altyn Asyr FC of Turkmenistan are last with zero.\nAltyn Asyr host Air Force in this evening’s other fixture in Ashgabat, scheduled for a 5pm kick-off, Bahrain time.\nKhaldiya are coming off a resounding 4-1 win against Air Force in their previous match at the beginning of this month played at home, while Taawoun also had a big win in Ashgabat, where they routed Altyn Asyr 4-0.\nThe ACL Two is the second-tier club competition of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). Rebranded from the AFC Cup, it is one level below the AFC Champions League Elite and one above the AFC Challenge League.\nFollowing tonight’s clash, Khaldiya wrap up their Group B schedule against Altyn Asyr at home on December 4.\nThe ACL Two features 32 clubs from across Asia this season. The top two clubs from each of the eight groups in this preliminary stage move on to the round of 16 knockouts, which are to be held in 2025.\nTop stories for today\nFood security ‘vital for growth’\nSHINING BRIGHT: Top expos like Jewellery Arabia ‘opportunities to drive progress’\nCityscape Bahrain open",
