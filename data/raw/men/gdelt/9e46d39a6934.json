The left-footed defender will help with that, though he'd likely have to compete with Lisandro Martinez at centre-back.\nTransfermarkt values Branthwaite at just £25m, but with three years still remaining on his current contract, and the fact he is still 21, it'll obviously take more than double that valuation for Manchester United to take him to Old Trafford.\nIn FourFourTwo's view, this is a deal that certainly could happen, especially considering Everton's financial difficulties in recent times, though it would make more sense for the Red Devils to focus on a right-sided centre-back. Martinez would clearly be first choice when fully fit, meaning more than £60m on a back-up option is a hefty fee.\nMore Manchester United stories\nManchester United identify ideal midfield partner for Kobbie Mainoo - from relegation-threatened club: report\nManchester United have 'intensified' move for star who could become one of the fastest players in the Premier League: report\nArsenal 'talks ongoing' with superstar striker wanted by Manchester United: report\nRyan is a staff writer for FourFourTwo, joining the team full-time in October 2022.
