  "body_text": "Gaurs eye continental glory in high-stakes Fatorda showdown\nFatorda: A big night awaits Goan football as FC Goa prepare to lock horns with Oman’s Al Seeb in a do-or-die play-off for a place in the AFC Champions League Two on Wednesday at the Fatorda Stadium.\nLed by former India coach Manolo Marquez, the Gaurs will enjoy the backing of a passionate home crowd in this single-legged tie. Victory will see them join Mohun Bagan Super Giant—who qualified by winning last season’s ISL Shield—in Asia’s second-tier continental competition. The loser will drop to the AFC Challengers League.\nFresh from their Super Cup triumph, FC Goa will make their first continental appearance since 2021, when they became the first Indian club to feature in the AFC Champions League group stage. But Al Seeb, two-time reigning Oman Professional League champions and 2022 AFC Cup winners, promise a formidable challenge.\nWith multiple Oman internationals in their ranks and a FIFA ranking of 79, the visitors will test every ounce of Goa’s mettle. Marquez remains optimistic. “It won’t be easy for us, but it won’t be easy for them either,” he said.\nIn their last Asian campaign, FC Goa earned three draws in a tough group featuring sides like Al Rayyan, Al Wahda and Persepolis FC. The latter reached the quarter-finals before losing to eventual champions Al Hilal FC.\n“I believe most clubs in India would love to be in this situation,” Marquez said ahead of the high-stakes clash. “It will be tough for us, but not easy for them either.”\nAl Seeb, boasting several Oman internationals, are still chasing World Cup qualification. The Omani champions are expected to pose a formidable challenge.\nMarquez stressed the importance of home support, recalling the “special connection” between fans and players during last season’s ISL semi-final at Fatorda. The Gaurs, fresh from their Super Cup triumph, have bolstered their squad with Spanish trio Javier Siverio, David Timor, and Pol Moreno.\n“This is an all-or-nothing match,” Marquez said. “For us to succeed, everyone has to deliver.”",
