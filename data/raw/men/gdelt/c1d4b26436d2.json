A pair of penalties saw Forest past Porto in the Europa League on Thursday.\nFor Bournemouth, happily trotting along at their historic peak for the last few seasons, European football has thus far been elusive. Andoni Iraola seems destined to change that.\nGet Bournemouth tickets at Seat Unique\nBournemouth hospitality provides a polished experience in the intimate Vitality Stadium. Guests access the Cherry Orchard Restaurant for gourmet three-course dining (even including a breakfast option for early games!), premium padded seating, and a welcome drink. The package also includes half/full-time refreshments and an official programme.\nDyche is in his happy place: he's a man with a job to do. Forest are in the bottom three in the Premier League and haven't won domestically since the opening weekend in August.\nThat win against Brentford came two days after Bournemouth's last league defeat in the very first game of the Premier League season against champions Liverpool.\nThe Cherries are unbeaten at home in the league. Dyche or not, Bournemouth come into this match as favourites.\nForest are battling against the weight of history too. They haven't beaten Bournemouth for a decade despite being in the same division for precisely half of it.\nBournemouth have won six of those 10 matches including their most recent meeting in January. Forest bagged the European place at the end of the season but their last visit to the Vitality Stadium ended in a 5-0 defeat thanks to a Dango Ouattara hat-trick.\nDyche will lap up that challenge and make sure his players are wound up too.\nThat's a given. The question is whether he can turn the ship around in choppy waters once he's had more time aboard.\nSee also ► These are the cheapest ways to watch the Premier League this season\nBournemouth vs Nottingham Forest: Expected line-ups\nFourFourTwo's prediction\nBournemouth 2-0 Nottingham Forest\nForest can be expected to perform with a little more gusto under Dyche but improving result can take time.\nWe test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses.
