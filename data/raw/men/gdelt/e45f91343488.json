  "body_text": "There was a double take from Oliver Glasner as he arrived at his pre-match press conference.\nThe room down at Crystal Palace’s training ground is also used for the team’s tactical meetings and, much to the manager’s surprise, a flip chart sporting a host of data had been left out in full view of the media in attendance.\nAdvertisement\n“Do any of you know what these numbers mean?” he asked his audience. Silence. So he proceeded to explain.\nThey referred to the volume of high-intensity sprints made by his players in recent matches. Some of them, he said, were the highest in the club’s history. His pride was understandable given on-field dynamism underpins Glasner’s style of management. Last March, shortly after his appointment at Selhurst Park, he had revealed that one of his earliest messages to his players had been “we have to run more, we have to run faster, we have to sprint so much”.\nThe conditioning took time, but the flip chart was evidence that the squad have bought into his principles.\nIn 2023-24, Palace ranked below the Premier League average for high-speed running and sprinting distance per match. This campaign, their game averages in those metrics are up 10 and 24 per cent respectively, ranking them fourth and sixth in the division.\nIntensity is particularly important when it comes to winning second balls, a key element to Palace’s game given they have the worst aerial duel win rate in the division (44 per cent, three per cent lower than the next worst, Aston Villa), but compensate with intense running and smart midfield positioning.\nThe onus he places on that aspect of the game will come as no surprise to those who have followed the Austrian’s coaching career. Even in his early days in charge of SV Ried, that focus on running combined with data analysis was apparent.\n“Oliver showed the president and head of the club the system he wanted on a TV,” Xandi Mitterhofer, Ried’s director of finance who has worked for the club since 1996, told The Athletic last year. “It was about how fast a player can run in his system. He was a step higher. He had a big map and he knew all about the player in this match: ‘He runs this fast and so many kilometres’.”\nAdvertisement\nThat was a glimpse of the coach’s meticulous nature. But what does he demand of his players, what is the game plan, and how does he have them implement it?\nGlasner inherited a Palace team that had won only twice in 16 matches in all competitions last season and, once his players had grown accustomed to his methods, propelled them to a top-half finish. This campaign has had its ups and downs, but they remain on course to achieve their highest Premier League points tally, could still achieve their best placing, and, on Saturday, will confront Villa in the sixth FA Cup semi-final in the club’s history.\nHis approach, on and off the pitch, has had a transformative effect and as Palace seek to secure him on a new contract, there have been covetous glances cast in his direction from clubs in the German Bundesliga. His reputation is established.\nGlasner is an astute tactician who showed an interest in that side of the game in his days as a player in Austria. He knows his approach works — he can point to the Europa League success he enjoyed at Eintracht Frankfurt in 2022 as evidence, along with the effect he has had at Palace. Neither does he lack confidence.\nAfter a heavy defeat to Manchester City earlier this month — when he watched his side surrender a 2-0 lead, changed his system at half-time and then shipped three more goals after the break — he was asked whether he felt he would be able to outdo Pep Guardiola should their teams meet in the FA Cup final. “I told Pep after the game that he can’t play this system (again) because we will beat it,” was his response.\nPerhaps that may not prove to be the wisest comment, but it demonstrated his unswerving belief in himself, his coaching staff and his players. Palace under Glasner fear no one, not even teams with far greater resources at their disposal. Their manager believes this team can win any game.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s important we respect the top teams, but not so much that we don’t believe in ourselves,” he said ahead of a visit from Arsenal back in December. “If we always have the mindset that it’s Arsenal, it’s Manchester City, then we will never win.”\nPalace were ultimately overwhelmed in that fixture, but that confidence did not dip. On Wednesday night, they twice came from behind to draw 2-2 at the Emirates in the return fixture.\n“He understands football,” Klaus Roitinger, his former coach at SV Ried, where Glasner spent almost all his playing days and began his coaching career, told The Athletic last year. “In his brain, he knows, ‘I must play so and so (in a tactical sense)’, and he knows if the players have it in their brain, then success will happen.”\nSo what is his philosophy?\nGlasner is all about the system. Individuals need to fit into that, rather than him seeking to adjust the overall approach to incorporate talented players.\nWhile there is an appreciation for technical ability, he demands that his players are equally as good without the ball as they are with it. Eberechi Eze’s talent, for example, is more evident when in possession, but Glasner, while still appreciating the midfielder’s ability, is less sold on him given his individualist style of play is difficult to embrace within a structure that is more team-oriented.\nHis focus is on attacking play, as evidenced by those high-intensity runs and energy. “My philosophy is very easy: it’s scoring goals because that’s why, as I tell the players very often, we all started playing football,” Glasner told Palace TV after being appointed. “Nobody went on the pitch when he was a young kid to defend.”\nDirectness is key. “When we enter the final third, I don’t like to play possession there,” he added. “Sometimes you need a lot of effort to come into the final third. So let’s get numbers into the box and the ball into the box and try to score. When we are there, let’s try to go for a goal, not stay in possession.”\nAdvertisement\nGlasner’s system allows the wide centre-backs to step out and be ambitious on the ball, playing two No 6s and two No 10s naturally overloads a midfield three, while flying wing-backs help get in behind opponents.\nEven with a different squad, his Palace side are similar to his Eintracht team. This season, their average goal-ending sequence is 7.3 seconds and 2.2 passes long, way below the league median (10.5 seconds and 3 passes), and the speed at which they move the ball upfield for those moves is the fastest in the division.\nFootovision, an analytics company that uses broadcast footage with event data to create contextual metrics, have Palace using the second-most up-back-through passing patterns in the Premier League this term, behind only Manchester United (who play a similar shape under Ruben Amorim). These are four-player patterns: the first attacker plays a forward pass to break a line, the second shifts it onto a third team-mate, who plays an early vertical pass into a fourth attacker.\nThat move can be seen in the build-up to Eze’s opener in the 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final win against Fulham.\nAfter Palace recovered the ball in their own half, right centre-back Chris Richards immediately passed forward to No 10 Ismaila Sarr. Because Fulham defender Antonee Robinson was tight to him, Sarr had to bounce the pass back to Maxence Lacroix, who clipped a diagonal ball over midfield to the advancing wing-back Tyrick Mitchell. He duly found Eze inside him.\nWhile the goal itself was converted courtesy of real individual brilliance — Eze cutting inside and curling his shot around bodies and into the far corner — the pattern to put Eze in a dribbling position on the edge of the box owed to a well-executed up-back-through pattern.\nIt is a contrast in playing style to that of Roy Hodgson and previous iterations of Palace — featuring Yannick Bolasie, Wilfried Zaha, Andros Townsend and Michael Olise — which were more individualistic in their attacking and reliant on dribbles. Glasner’s Palace in 2024-25 have attempted the fewest dribbles of any Premier League team and those combinative, incisive passing patterns have shades of German football.\nAdvertisement\nGlasner spent four seasons coaching Eintracht and Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga, which is notorious for its counter-attacking goals and the homogeneity of vertical attacking. The domestic toils his Eintracht team endured in 2021-22 — they won only three of their last 17 league games to finish 11th — while simultaneously progressing to the final of the Europa League helped convince him of the most effective approach.\n“I said to my analysts: ‘Why? Those teams we lost against (in the Bundesliga) were weaker’,” he said earlier this month. “In all those 14 games (in which Eintracht failed to win), the opposition had less possession. Teams playing counter-attacks and transitions in the Europa League had more possession. I said: ‘OK, let’s give them the ball’. All the others who tried to win by possession failed, so let’s do the opposite. We let them play.”\nThat was a natural extension of his instincts. He said in his press conference before Palace’s 1-0 win at Anfield last April that he had long admired then-Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp. “Jurgen was inspirational for many German-speaking coaches,” he said. “His was maybe a new style of playing: very aggressive, very intense, and it was this he promoted. The counterpress.\n“It was new at this time and at the end of my career as a player. His approach to the game had a lot of influence on my view of the game and still does. How they play with this intensity. Many times when they lose the ball, it’s like someone whistles and 10 players are hunting the ball.”\nWith the increasing rarity of back threes and wing-back formations in Europe’s major leagues, positional retraining is sometimes needed, especially for forwards, to operate in Glasner’s preferred 3-4-2-1. That partly explains why his sides tend to start seasons slowly as new players become accustomed to his methods, develop the physical conditioning to play with the intensity he demands, and gain familiarity with each other.\nHis system, which he initially played at Wolfsburg before moving to a 4-2-3-1, was refined at Eintracht.\nHere is that shape from the Europa League final, when Eintracht beat Rangers in May 2022. Note the aggressive positioning of the wing-backs (yellow dots) and how high the No 9 stays to stretch the play.\nFor comparison, here are Palace building up with an almost identical shape earlier this month.\nAttacking wing-backs find success in this system.\nAdvertisement\nGlasner’s main creator at Eintracht was Filip Kostic, a dangerous crosser from left wing-back who also made a habit of popping up in the box as an extra attacker — he scored seven and assisted 14 times in 2021-22. At Palace, on the other side of the pitch, Daniel Munoz is excelling. The role naturally suits his running-based style and tendency to crash the box.\nStrikers have always flourished under Glasner’s guidance.\nWout Weghorst had his best scoring season leading the line at Wolfsburg in 2020-21, Glasner’s second season there, with 20 league goals. Similarly, the 2022-23 campaign earned Randal Kolo Muani a move to Paris Saint-Germain for €80million (£68.4m; $91m), with Eintracht having signed him on a free from Nantes a year before. He thrived in a direct and often transitional Frankfurt 3-4-2-1, given channel balls and space to isolate defenders, plus plenty of cutbacks.\nKolo Muani netted 23 goals and set up 14 more in all competitions in 2022-23, with double digits in the Bundesliga and Champions League combined, taking Eintracht to the knockout stage on their competition debut. He was top scorer (with six) in the DFB-Pokal, too, with Eintracht losing finalists to RB Leipzig.\nJean-Philippe Mateta is the latest example of Glasner’s system squeezing the most from a No 9.\nHis 27 league goals since Glasner’s arrival last February are the fourth-most of any Premier League player (behind only Alexander Isak, Mohamed Salah and Erling Haaland), while 2023-24 was his best top-flight scoring season (16 goals). With four games remaining, he could yet eclipse that this term, having scored his 14th of the campaign against Arsenal on Wednesday night.\nA key part of Mateta, Weghorst and Kolo Muani’s individual success is the relationship with the No 10s and the supply from the wing-backs. With a No 9 who stretches defences, space is made for creative midfielders such as Eze — at Eintracht, this was Daichi Kamada, and Josip Brekalo at Wolfsburg — who can then combine with the striker or work crossing angles.\nEze has assisted Mateta eight times under Glasner in all competitions, while the Brekalo-Weghorst and Kamada-Kolo Muani combinations both returned 10 goals across two seasons each.\nThe most times one player has assisted another in the Premier League this season:\n— Squawka (@Squawka) April 18, 2025\n◉ 7 – Murphy ➡️ Isak\n◉ 6 – Eze ➡️ Mateta\n◉ 5 – Savinho ➡️ Haaland\nThe dynamic duos. 🤝 pic.twitter.com/1yiBPm6qsx\nArguably, this season’s success story has been Ismaila Sarr, a player effectively bought from Marseille as a versatile squad option last summer.\nAdvertisement\nThe Senegalese had never played as a No 10 before, but despite stints within games as a No 9 and also a stop-gap wing-back, that is where he has made his impact. He took time to learn the role but has since established an excellent on-field rapport with Munoz on the right flank.\nThere is no huge secret in how Glasner makes all that on-field synergy possible. It is achieved through tireless hard work and painstaking analysis. He once returned home after an Eintracht game and watched the match back until 4am, then went through it all again with his staff a few hours later. He has an obsession with video analysis.\nTrust is non-negotiable, while familiarity is also fundamental to his management style. He has worked with Michael Angerschmid and Ronald Brunmayr, both of whom were his team-mates at Ried, at previous roles. The same applies to Emanuel Pogatetz, the former Middlesbrough centre-back with whom he worked in Austria at LASK, but also to players.\nHe pushed to be reunited with Kamada at Selhurst Park. Maxence Lacroix, who played under him at Wolfsburg, was also signed on his insistence.\n“He can make a normal player into a good player because he helps you to give everything you have,” Lacroix told reporters before Palace’s FA Cup semi-final with Villa. His players are worked hard, pushed to the limit, but their efforts are rewarded with days off and, most significantly of all, positive results.\nHe will wear his heart on his sleeve on the touchline, in games and at training, making clear his frustration if things are not to his liking. During one session at Palace’s training ground in Beckenham, a young attacker took the ball down the flank, beat his man and cut back in-field to do so again. Glasner was livid and turned to his staff to express his dissatisfaction — in German, as is often his way when the fury emerges — that the youngster had not driven on down the line, which is how he prefers his team to play.\nFor the player, it was a lesson learned.\nAdvertisement\nThere are standards that have to be maintained. Slack timekeeping is a pet hate. The under-21 side recently reported for training at 8:30am at the academy and a select few were told to make the short trip over the road to the first-team complex for an 11am start. One player turned up five minutes late, only to find the door closed on him. He was dispatched back to the under-21s.\nGlasner often returns to the idea of “intrinsic motivation” — a concept that means everyone must be minded to be the best they can and that it cannot be imparted by anyone external. He refuses to look too far back or too far forward, preferring instead to focus on the controllables in the present. It is something that appears to stem from surviving a brain haemorrhage that forced a premature end to his playing career.\nAnd yet he is fiercely ambitious.\nHe harbours hopes to one day manage at one of the Premier League’s elite clubs. Bayern Munich were rebuffed in their attempts to bring him to the Allianz Arena last May with Palace demanding hefty compensation, but they would likely not have made an approach if they had not believed he would be prepared to make the move just two months after joining Palace.\nThis summer may again see interest. RB Leipzig are seeking a replacement for Marco Rose. Bayer Leverkusen may have to contemplate life without Xabi Alonso. Closer to home, Tottenham Hotspur may well be seeking a replacement for Ange Postecoglou. Glasner would no doubt be a name they would all consider.\nRecent mixed results at Palace should not cloud suitors’ judgement. Glasner’s stock is high with good reason. Just as Palace are a stepping stone for their most talented young players, they may prove likewise for a manager enjoying a successful first full season in the Premier League.\nGrander things surely await. But first, there is more to achieve at Selhurst Park.\n(Top photo: Ben Stansall/AFP via Getty Images)",
