  "body_text": "Chelsea have opened talks with Borussia Dortmund as they look to secure another new summer signing for Enzo Maresca.\nThe Blues have spent over £1bn on new signings in recent years and continued their big spending last month by agreeing deals for Sporting Lisbon stars Geovany Quenda and Dario Essugo.\nChelsea are expected to be one of the busiest teams in this summer’s transfer window, with a new striker and goalkeeper on Maresca’s wishlist.\nThe west London outfit have also been linked with several wingers despite an abundance of attacking talent at the club and are in talks to sign Jamie Gittens from Dortmund.\nAccording to talkSPORT, Chelsea have entered into discussions with the Bundesliga club about a summer deal for Gittens.\nThe 20-year-old caught the eye of some of the biggest clubs in Europe during an impressive first-half to the season, but he has endured a more difficult time since Niko Kovac took over in January.\nDortmund valued Gittens at around €100m just a few months ago but are willing to slash their asking price given the player’s drop-off.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nGittens spent two years in Manchester City’s academy – and some time at Chelsea – before being signed by Borussia Dortmund in 2020.\nReports in Germany claim Gittens has already informed Dortmund of his desire to move on this summer, with the talented winger open to a return to England.\nEarlier this year Gittens was tipped for a move to Chelsea’s London rivals Arsenal, who are keen to bolster Mikel Arteta’s attacking options following an injury-plagued campaign.\n‘I think there’s a good chance we could see Jamie Gittens playing in the Premier League next season,’ ex-Germany defender Markus Babbel told Wette.de.\n‘I don’t think Borussia Dortmund will qualify for the Champions League this season, or even for the Europa League or Conference League.\n‘They will have to sell some players this summer and Gittens is the player they’ll be able to sell for the most money – so a move would make sense for all parties.\nMore Trending\n‘Given his qualities, he’ll be wanting to play in the Champions League next year which is why Arsenal will have a massive chance of signing him in the summer. He’d be a brilliant addition to Mikel Arteta’s team.\n‘Out of the other Premier League clubs linked with Gittens, I’m not sure about Tottenham’s chances of signing him, or even Chelsea’s, as he’ll be wanting to play Champions League football next year, which is why I believe he will leave Dortmund at the end of this season.’\nChelsea have hopes of qualifying for Champions League and winning the Europa Conference League with a handful of games remaining.\nThey boosted their top-five hopes with a narrow victory over Everton on Saturday and face Swedish minnows Djurgardens in the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Liverpool 5-1 Tottenham: Mohamed Salah scores in comeback win as Reds land title\nMORE: Wayne Rooney hails ‘outstanding’ Arsenal, Man Utd and Liverpool transfer target",
