So he signed a two-month loan deal to return to the Emirates Stadium in January 2012.\n\"When it comes to Arsenal my heart will always do the talking,\" he announced at the time.\nHenry openly accepted that he wasn't coming back to be the main man. His old number 14 shirt wasn't available, so he settled for the vacant number 12 instead, a jersey he already knew well and had worn throughout his international career with France.\nIt was actually the shirt he had first wanted 13 years earlier.\n\"When I arrived at Arsenal [in 1999], I wanted number 12, but Christopher Wreh had number 12,\" the legend told 90min to celebrate the release of Venom: The Last Dance, looking back at his glorious return.\nThe number 12 would indeed play a huge part in one of modern football's best loved moments.\nBack with Arsenal, Henry was prepared to sit on the bench, or even just be an experienced and inspirational voice in the dressing room if that was how he could best help the team.\nBut when the Gunners were facing Leeds United at the Emirates Stadium in the FA Cup third round just three days after his return became official, the stage was set beautifully.\n\"That game, the Leeds game, the scenario was perfect because it's 0-0. You come on, in my mind, I'm like…'Just imagine if I score the winner',\" Henry recalls thinking.\nIncredibly, he did. And it was a vintage Henry finish too, as he took up position to the left-hand side of the box and opened up his body to find the far bottom corner with his right foot.\n\"When I came back, I had number 12…in 2012. I scored with 12 minutes to go. That was my 12th game against Leeds and my 12th goal against Leeds,\" he says, reflecting on the series of stunning 12-related coincidences at play.\n\"I left the stadium that day at 1:30 in the morning. I still had my shin pads and my shorts on. I didn’t want to move.\"\nHenry went on to score once more for Arsenal before he returned to New York, netting the 91st minute winner in a Premier League victory over Sunderland in his last game on English soil. His final Arsenal tally, standing at 228 goals in 377 appearances.",
