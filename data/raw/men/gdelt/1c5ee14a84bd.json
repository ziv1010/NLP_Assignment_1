His first taste of success came in the 2015/16 season as he guided City to an undefeated championship-winning season in the A-League Women competition.\nHe then made history in 2017 as the first Australian to manage Arsenalâ€™s Womenâ€™s Team, lifting multiple trophies during his tenure, including the Womenâ€™s Super League during the 2018/19 season.\nIn 2021, Montemurro joined Juventus Women, where success continued to follow as he led them to the Serie A title in the 2021/22 season, several domestic cup triumphs, and a rise in continental competitiveness. 2024 saw him appointed as head coach of European powerhouse Olympique Lyon, where this year he was at the helm as they claimed the 2024/25 domestic league title in France.\nHis appointment was announced ahead of the Matildas' friendly match against Argentina in Canberra on Monday night, which will be the final game in charge for interim head coach Tom Sermanni.\nIt comes 10 months after the departure of previous head coach Tony Gustavsson, who guided Australia to the semifinals of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nMontemurro's first games as Matildas head coach will be a pair of friendlies against Slovenia on June 26 and 28. His first major tournament will be the 2026 Asian Football Confederation Women's Asian Cup, which will be hosted in Australia.",
