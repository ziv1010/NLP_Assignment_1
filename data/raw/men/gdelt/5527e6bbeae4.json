Below, find a complete list of everything new on Paramount+ in January 2026.\nNew releases on Paramoun+ in January 2026: Top picks\n'Girl Taken'\nThis six-episode scripted thriller, based on Hollie Overton’s novel \"Baby Doll,\" follows twin sisters Lily (Tallulah Evans) and Abby (Delphi Evans), whose lives are torn apart when Lily is abducted from their rural English town by a teacher. Years later, Lily escapes captivity, only to face a painful reality: The world she dreamed of returning to has moved on, and freedom is terrifying enough on its own.\nPremieres January 8 on Paramount+\n'Coldwater'\n\"The Walking Dead\" alum Andrew Lincoln returns to British TV as a seemingly ordinary man whose life changes after he crosses paths with someone extremely dangerous. Told over six episodes, the series delves into how a normal marriage and supposedly unassuming (and unobtrusive) life can spiral into something dark and unpredictable. It's all about manipulation and how far it can go, which, from what we've seen so far of \"Coldwater,\" looks quite terrifying.\nPremieres January 9 on Paramount+\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\n'Starfleet Academy'\nThis modern \"Star Trek\" series explores a new generation of hopeful cadets training to become Starfleet officers. Sure, they've got tons of coursework to handle, but now they've also got friendships, rivalries, and even love in the mix making things even more difficult. It's hard enough to become a Starfleet officer without having to grow up at the same time. And they’re forced to grow quickly under the pressure of their instructors and a looming threat that puts both the Academy and the Federation at risk -- familiar stuff, but through a different lens.\nPremieres January 15 on Paramount+\nEverything coming to Paramount+ in January 2026\nORIGINALS, EXCLUSIVES, PREMIERES & EVENTS\n1/1: Barron’s Cove - Paramount+ Exclusive*\n1/8: Girl Taken - NEW Paramount+ Original Series\n1/9: Coldwater - NEW Showtime Original Series*\n1/11: 83rd Annual Golden Globes (CBS)**\n1/15: Star Trek: Starfleet Academy - NEW Paramount+ Original Series\n1/20: Handsome Devil: The Charming Killer - NEW Paramount+ Original Series\n1/22: Canada Shore - NEW Paramount+ Original Series\n1/23: Zuffa Boxing on Paramount+ Debut\n1/24: UFC on Paramount+ Debut\n1/25: NFL AFC Championship Game\n1/28: School Spirits: Season 3 - Paramount+ Original Series\nNew shows\nJanuary 7\nHarlan Coben’s Final Twist: Season 1**\nJanuary 8\nGirl Taken | Paramount+ Original Series\nGolden Eve** (CBS Special)\nJanuary 9\nColdwater* | Showtime Original Series (new episodes weekly)\nJanuary 11\nET: Live on the Golden Globes Red Carpet**\nJanuary 14\nBar Rescue: Season 9\nPeppa Pig: Season 10\nJanuary 15\nStar Trek: Starfleet Academy | Paramount+ Original Series (Episodes 101 & 102 drop on Jan. 15, followed by new episodes weekly)\nJanuary 20\nHandsome Devil: The Charming Killer | Paramount+ Original Series\nJanuary 21\nSpongeBob SquarePants: Season 15\nJanuary 22\nCanada Shore | Paramount+ Original Series (new episodes weekly)\nJanuary 27\nCollege*\nJanuary 28\nSchool Spirits: Season 3 | Paramount+ Original Series (Episodes 301-303 drop on Jan. 28 followed by new episodes weekly)\nJanuary 30\nInside the 68th Annual Grammy Awards**\nJanuary 31\nThe Hundred-Foot Journey*\nNew movies\nJanuary 1\n10 Cloverfield Lane\n50 First Dates\nA Man Called Horse\nA.I.
