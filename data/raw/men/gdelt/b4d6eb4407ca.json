  "body_text": "Manchester United were held to a dismal draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Old Trafford this evening — with Casemiro’s performance summing up his team’s woeful performance.\nRock Bottom against Rock Bottom\nThe Red Devils had the chance to jump into the top four with a win against the a side stranded at the bottom of the Premier League table.\nBut, as has become customary this season, Ruben Amorim’s men conspired to squander their golden ticket into the Champions League places.\nWolves had only managed two draws, with zero wins and 16 losses, before the trip to the Theatre of Dreams. But they had chances to grab all three points, with Senne Lammens making crucial saves to spare United’s blushes.\nAmorim had overseen an uptick in performance in recent weeks with an adaptation to his 3-4-2-1 system. But the Portuguese coach reverted back to his favoured set-up — and the result spoke for itself, with every player bar the goalkeeper looking a shadow of themselves from the Boxing Day triumph over Newcastle.\nCasemiro stood out as particularly poor, however, with the experienced Brazilian looking every bit of his 33 years of age at the heart of the the team.\nA transplant has never been more urgent to revive the failing midfield, and INEOS must reconsider their plan to wait until the summer to address the problem position.\nThe Bumbling Brazilian\nWith a host of United’s most influential attacking players absent, either through injury or international duty, this was an opportunity for Casemiro to stamp his authority in a must-win match.\nBut the former Real Madrid star was a shadow of the defensive midfielder who dominated European football at the Santiago Bernabeu.\nHe finished the match with only one interception, two recoveries, zero blocks and seven lost duels. He surrendered possession nine times and was dribbled past twice, making two fouls and just four successful tackles.\nCasemiro fared better when distributing the ball, completing 41 of 49 accurate passes (84%), and creating one great chance which Benjamin Sesko failed to convert.\nStatistics provided by Sofa Score\nBut the Brazil international — the best paid player at the club — should have been more impactful in possession against a side destined for relegation.\nHis contract expires at the end of the season, though United retain the option to extend it by twelve months. There is zero appetite to activate this clause, however, with INEOS desperate to be rid of his exorbitant salary.\nThere had been suggestions a new extension, on drastically reduced terms, was in the works — but tonight’s performance, or lack thereof, should be the final nail in the coffin of Casemiro’s career at Old Trafford.\nFeatured image Michael Regan via Getty Images\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade.
