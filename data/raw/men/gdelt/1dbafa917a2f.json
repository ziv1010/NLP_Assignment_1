At national level, incidents include players and fans being involved in a brawl during a Euro 2016 qualifier against Albania, causing riot police to be called in and the match to be abandoned.\nIvan Bogdanov, a notorious Serbian ultra and convicted football hooligan, was among those who broke onto the pitch.\nEngland’s curtain-raiser has been judged ‘high risk’ by Uefa and the German authorities, with a local police chief in host city Gelsenkirchen expressing a concern that up to 500 ‘violence-seeking’ Serbian hooligans will travel to the host nation in the run-up to the game.\nPeter Both also told The Guardian that more than 1,000 German police officers will be on duty for the match, backed up by spotters and a riot unit.\nHowever Serbia is far from the only participating nation with a hooligan problem; ugly incidents involving followers of French, German and Polish club sides have arisen in recent years.\n‘If they are anything like the Russians at Marseille, they will be far more organised and you could say professional in how they go about things,’ Hope said of the Serbian hooligans.\n‘England fans on the main will be young groups of lads, many going to their first tournament, looking to have a drink and enjoy the tournament.\n‘Thousands will not have tickets and there may be anti-social behaviour but as we saw last season, the level of disorder we’ve regularly seen in central Europe has not been present in England very often.’\nThe UEFA competition kicked off on June 14 and will take place across 10 venues, with at least 500,000 England and Scotland fans expected to make the trip to Germany.\nScotland were thrashed 5-1 by Germany on Friday, with the Three Lions playing Serbia at 8pm in the 55,000-capacity Arena AufSchalke stadium.\nThe majority of the British fans are expected to travel to Germany without tickets and are likely to descend on fan parks set up in the host cities.\nHope pinpointed the ability of the British and Germany police to understand England and Scotland fans as key to preventing crowd trouble.\n‘The behaviour by a minority of fans can then be managed taking into account the tolerance levels on both sides, preventing a wider escalation when otherwise well-behaved fans view police action as unwarranted and get drawn into the disorder,’ he said.\n‘With Serbia, the questions are how well their police know who the ultras are and how they monitor their movements and how pro-active they are in assisting the Germans in managing those groups when they arrive.\n‘This is true on a country-by-county basis.’\nThe former Royal Marine’s research into safety at games includes his work with the Keele-led ENABLE project, which has involved bringing together academics, the English Football League, police and clubs to enhance the way matches are policed and stewarded.\n‘The sophisticated and embedded UK approach which has been in operation for many years is probably the model of best practice among the nations taking part,’ he said. ‘British police will have to work hard in order to manage these challenging dynamics.\n‘But if they are utilised effectively by their German counterparts it should be a successful operation keeping any disorder to a minimum as thousands of England and Scotland fans enjoy the games.’\nMore Trending\nThe current Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office advice states there is a ‘high threat’ of a terror attack in Germany affecting UK interests and British nationals.\nThe office says that the host nation’s authorities ‘regularly’ report that they have disrupted plots and made arrests.\nBritish nationals travelling to Euro 2024 are advised to sign up to email updates and download the official app and to follow basic safety advice such as keeping personal belongings and valuables safe and respecting local cultural sensitivities.\nMORE: Russian thugs ‘want to take the hooligan crown from the English’\nMORE: Euros are security challenge ‘on steroids’ with fears of terror and right-wing violence\nMORE: England fans face violent Serbian ultra army at ‘high risk’ Euros 2024 clash\nDo you have a story you would like to share?
