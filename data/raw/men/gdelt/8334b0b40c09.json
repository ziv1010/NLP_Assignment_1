  "body_text": "Gael Clichy arrived at Arsenal in 2003 as a 17-year-old with only 15 appearances in the French third division. He walked into a dressing room where the doyen of the managerial world at the time, Arsene Wenger, was a god-like figure. He was flanked by Patrick Vieira and Robert Pires, giants of the game in their own right, but Thierry Henry was the idol of every French teenager.\nAdvertisement\nIt was Henry who tapped Clichy’s shoulder 10 months later as they stood on the Highbury turf celebrating the unparalleled feat of winning the Premier League without losing a single game. Take it all in, he urged. It would be over in a flash.\nTwo decades later, in the summer of 2023, as Clichy contemplated one final stint in a 22-year playing career, Henry was in his ear again. Only, this time he was not imparting words of wisdom. He was seeking Clichy’s counsel.\n“I don’t think I was ready to stop playing football,” Clichy, now 40, tells The Athletic.\n“I was two days away from signing for Paris FC. With the Olympics coming, I thought I could play a season and maybe be one of the three over-23 players.\n“But me and Thierry had been talking for the last year or so about how we see the game and he wanted me to be his assistant with France Under-21s and the Olympics team. The best way for me to start as a player had been in that dressing room with the Invincibles and as a coach, the best start would be to follow Thierry. I had to go for it.\n“The fact he came for me — it was an important job for him as he still had to prove he was still capable of delivering — was a big honour. I was really surprised by the man I found as a coach.”\nIn his first managerial role, Henry had endured a chaotic time at Monaco, where he inherited a decimated squad and had to use 40 players, many of them novice youth players. Having been appointed in October 2018, he lasted just 20 games and was dismissed the following January. His 14-month tenure at Montreal Impact was more fruitful, guiding the MLS club to the play-offs for the first time in four years and reaching the Concacaf Champions League quarter-final.\nSome had questions over his potential as a coach, however. There was an impression he may be one of those genius players who struggled to relate to inferior talents as a coach. Not Clichy, however.\n“I saw a different person from the man I knew at Arsenal,” says Clichy.\nAdvertisement\n“People never really knew Thierry as a smiley face. He was always scoring goals and being super focused, so some people saw him as arrogant. I didn’t. A relationship with Thierry is about how you behave and conduct yourself. He is very demanding and if you don’t fall into that category as a coach or a player there is no relationship. You need to respect the game. I understand this attitude.\n“The media work in France, England, CBS (in the U.S.) has helped, as you see his true personality come out, but the main change is that he is more attuned to people and their feelings. He didn’t have to be before. He knew if it was 0-0 and Arsenal needed a goal, he could take the ball and do it. He understands that as a manager, you need a team behind a team and have to make everyone feel right.”\nClichy recalls an example of Henry’s mellowing when deciding the logistics of a mid-camp rest period before the Olympics started. “We were making them work hard but had the opportunity to give two or three days off to the players,” says Clichy.\n“Thierry wanted three and the other staff were only thinking of two because the players could take a plane and go wherever they want. But Thierry asked about the other staff — the doc, the physios, the kit man. Some of them would need to take a taxi, a train for five hours and another taxi to get home. They would have to do the same journey back so would have less than 24 hours. If we gave them three days, they will have two days with their family. Nobody had thought of that.”\nFrance claimed the silver medal, losing 5-3 to Spain in the final despite coming back from 3-1 down to force extra time.\nOne player who played little part in that Olympic campaign was Manchester City’s Rayan Cherki. The midfielder, then at Lyon, was already one of the most experienced players in the squad but made only one start in six games.\nAdvertisement\n“As a manager, he can be frustrating for many reasons but it is very rare you see anyone with this much quality. Knowing that, you always want to see more from him as he can do things no one else can do.\n“The under-21s was always too easy for him. What I saw with him was a consequence of being the best player everywhere since he was six. When you have been dealing with the feeling of always doing whatever you want because the coach knows you will make the difference, you can understand how Rayan built himself to be the player he is.\n“But as you grow up, you need to do more than just ball work. You need to track your run, close the angle of passes, and work for the team. At 21, it is not the case that he doesn’t want to do it, it is just that he almost had to reset himself. To know that he can do it — and has to do it.”\nCherki has started the last two Premier League games under Pep Guardiola, who has sought to find a way to provide him with freedom without compromising team stability.\n“This is the most important challenge Pep will have with Rayan because when you play against low blocks every weekend, it is very rare to find players who can unlock those situations with the ball at their feet. If you can turn him into doing the important bits off the ball — I’m not saying have him run 13km — he is going to be a tremendous player.\n“Pep will tell him, ‘When you have the ball, just be who you are. This is why we signed you’, but nobody wanted to touch Rayan because of that uncertainty over the work out of possession.\n“He is a great guy but as a coach, you need to understand the Premier League. Yes, we want you for those moments in the half-spaces but teams are going to pick up on any weaknesses and you don’t want to be that weakness that we are defending with one man down.”\nWhen Henry resigned after the Olympics, Clichy stayed on to assist new under-21s coach Gerald Baticle but then stepped down in September to pursue his ambition to become a manager in his own right. “I knew I was going to like coaching but I didn’t know I was going to love it this much,” he says.\nAdvertisement\nThoughts of a coaching career were ignited when he spent a year witnessing how alive it made Guardiola. Clichy was intoxicated by it. He began taking notes, building his thoughts and ideas on the game as he spent his final playing years in Turkey and Switzerland with Istanbul Basaksehir and Servette, preparing for a move into management.\nClichy played under Wenger for eight years and was at City in Guardiola’s first year in England. They were two modernisers who shaped different eras of English football, but while Guardiola is developing his latest iteration at the Etihad, the criticism of Wenger was that he did not adapt his central idea enough to ensure Arsenal remained rigorous enough to compete.\nNow FIFA’s chief of global football development with genuine levers to change the game, Wenger’s proposal in December 2009 to replace throw-ins with kick-ins was mocked by those who viewed it as an admission that his teams could not cope with the so-called ugly side of the game.\n“His methodology was based around the affinity he had with a certain type of player,” says Clichy. “He loved a player who could execute a first touch better than anyone else but it meant we were less physical than the others. Bolton and Stoke took advantage, but not just us. I do feel we were short on two players: a dominant centre-back and a dominant No 6. Perhaps we couldn’t afford them at the time with the mortgage for the Emirates.”\nClichy does share Wenger’s commitment to playing attractive football. The rise of long throws and set pieces this season has led to questions about whether this trend has made football boring.\n“Unless we change the rules to encourage teams to play offensive football (that could become a problem),” says Clichy. “Say you are losing 4-2 but scoring a third goal in a game counts as 0.5 points. It means you can still get something out of it rather than a team defending, which is counterproductive to the love of the game.\n“Every time there is something in place, it is hard to make changes. When you talk about what I just said about 0.5 points or a throw-in becoming a kick-in, people are going to laugh but remember a few decades ago when you could pass the ball back and forth with the goalkeeper (picking the ball up)? The person who proposed (changing that) that probably got laughed at too, because change is uncomfortable.”\nAdvertisement\nThe former France left-back knows that feeling. After eight years in north London, he left Arsenal for Man City in July 2011, in a period in which the North London club lost at least one key player every season between 2007 and 2012.\nHenry and Alexander Hleb’s moves to Barcelona started the exodus, then Emmanuel Adebayor, Kolo Toure and Samir Nasri moved to the Etihad. Robin van Persie joined Manchester United, while Cesc Fabregas and Alex Song moved to the Camp Nou.\nClichy moved to City to win more silverware. The current Arsenal team have finished Premier League runners-up for three consecutive years. Would he be getting itchy feet if he were in the shoes of William Saliba, Declan Rice or Bukayo Saka, all entering their peak years?\n“The club is now up there with the top spenders, so the players would be assessing the situation differently from my time. But they will need to actually win silverware soon because a career goes fast and it’s already been three years. A nearly-there message will not be good anymore.\n“Arsenal, back in the day, with the Invincibles, had eight of the top 30 players in the world. You can’t compare this to any player they have today. I feel this year they have seven or eight players who can go and be world beaters but they are not there yet.”\nHe has great admiration for the job that Mikel Arteta has done since taking over in December 2019 and has little time for those who seek to besmirch the transformation by putting it down to their set-piece prowess.\n“Mikel has changed how people see Arsenal. In the Premier League, if you are disrespecting the physicality of the game and the set-play moments, you have a big problem. Mikel has done what he felt was needed for Arsenal to win.\n“They are first and you still have people arguing that they don’t play the Arsenal way. It doesn’t make any sense. The Arsenal way is to win trophies. Pretty or not, the fans will be happy.\nAdvertisement\n“We keep on talking about Wenger’s Arsenal playing really good football 20 years later. This is not the same game. It is not the same league. It is not the same generation of players. People who still think Man United need to play with the same DNA of (Sir Alex) Ferguson and are comparing that side to the current one. It is not the coach who is wrong. It is the people who are still comparing these teams.\n“If Arsenal win 1-0 with a set piece, then that is all we need to know. We need to accept the coach has a different vision. In the end, you need to win because then pretty much everyone will say it is good enough.”\nGuardiola and Wenger each has their own managerial disciple in Bayern Munich’s Vincent Kompany and Como’s Cesc Fabregas. Like Clichy, the latter also spent a year under Guardiola, and he hopes to merge both schools of thought in his own coaching.\n“Cesc was not someone very loud. He was a performance leader, always delivering on the pitch but he never struck me as the next manager. Vincent was different. He was already practising himself as a coach, with his leadership and his desire to improve.\n“Pep has specific positions which help you grow into the game. If we lose the ball, we are covered in transition. You use one, two, three touches, not more and when you get to the final third with the special players, they are allowed to dribble. It is actually a very simple way of seeing football but only for a player of a certain level of understanding.\n“You always have one, two, three, four options and the top players, like Kevin De Bruyne, will find option A. Others might find option B. I probably found option C but when you learn under him, you usually pick the right one because he makes it so easy to understand the game that you become a very good player.\n“I wasn’t as talented as (Dennis) Bergkamp, Pires, David Silva, (Sergio) Aguero. When you (are not as) talented, like me, something has to compensate. That was the desire to understand the game and never give up working.”\nAdvertisement\nThe dearth of French managers in the top leagues of Europe — Sunderland’s Regis Le Bris is the only one operating in the top flight of England, Spain, Italy or Germany — is an an anomaly given the national team won the World Cup in 2018, the Nations League in 2021 and has reached at least the semi-final stage in four of the last five major tournaments.\nWhereas Spain has capitalised on periods of dominance by exporting coaches all over the world, Clichy believes a factor may be that there is not the same prevailing football identity in France. That suits his coaching ambition of not falling into the trap of becoming an ideologue.\n“There is nothing wrong with being influenced by what is good. You want to be influenced by the top coaches because it is pretty and efficient. But I know that if I go for a second-division team, then some players will not be able to do what I have in mind.\n“The best managers are those who influence and improve players to get closer to what they want but who also understand that if you are in the third division, maybe they won’t be able to ping it 60 yards to the winger with their weaker foot. It sounds logical but people die because of smoking and a lot of people still do it.”",
