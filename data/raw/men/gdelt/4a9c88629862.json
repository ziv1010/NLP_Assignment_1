  "body_text": "The UEFA Champions League is returning tonight - but not as fans know it.\nIt’s an exciting new era for one of Europe’s top club competitions, with Manchester City, Arsenal, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Celtic among the 36 teams competing in a single league format for the first time.\nThe shake-up will see each club play eight opponents, with four matches at home and four away fixtures.\nThe top eight sides will automatically qualify for the knockout stages, while teams finishing ninth to 24th will take part in a two-legged play-off for a place in the last 16. The bottom 12 teams will exit the competition.\nWe’ve teamed up with online sports betting company bet365 to bring you the odds ahead of this week’s opening round of fixtures.\nYoung Boys v Aston Villa\nAston Villa make their long-awaited return to European football's biggest stage after more than four decades away when they take on Swiss Super League champions Young Boys.\nVilla head for the Stadion Wankdorf following their dramatic 3-2 win over Everton and having won both of their Premier League away games this season.\nMeanwhile, Young Boys have struggled to recapture last season’s form and find themselves bottom of the Super League with three draws and three losses in six games.\nYoung Boys 4/1, Draw 31/10, Aston Villa 13/20\nResult/Both teams to score:\nTo score:\n- Ollie Watkins: – First 15/4, Last 15/4, Anytime 11/10\n- Jhon Duran – First 6/1, Last 6/1, Anytime 15/8\n- Leon Bailey – First 13/2, Last 13/2, Anytime 21/10\nAC Milan v Liverpool\nTwo of Europe's heavyweights go head-to-head as AC Milan entertain Liverpool at the Stadio San Siro on Tuesday night.\nThe Rossoneri have had an unconvincing start to the Serie A season, registering two draws and a defeat before finally getting their first win at the weekend when they swept aside Venezia 4-0 at the San Siro.\nMeanwhile, Liverpool made a blistering start to the Premier League campaign by winning their first three games without conceding a single goal. But they go into this evening’s match on the back of a surprise 1-0 loss to Nottingham Forest at Anfield.\nAC Milan 14/5, Draw 14/5, Liverpool 10/11\nResult/Both teams to score:\nTo score:\n- Mohamed Salah – First 9/2, Last 9/2, Anytime 7/5\n- Darwin Nunez – First 5/1, Last 5/1, Anytime 8/5\n- Diogo Jota – First 11/2, Last 11/2, Anytime 7/4\nMan City v Inter Milan\nPep Guardiola’s side have already been installed as favourites to win this year’s competition, and their opening game sees a repeat of the 2023 final as they host Inter Milan at the Etihad Stadium.\nOn that occasion, City triumphed thanks to Rodri’s 68th-minute strike. But they appear set for a stern test this time around. Having won Serie A last season, finishing 19 points clear of rivals AC Milan, The Nerazzurri remain unbeaten four games into the new campaign.\nCity have won all their Premier League matches heading into this fixture, with Erling Haaland in devastating form. The Norwegian has already scored nine Premier League goals, making him favourite to net the first goal of the game.\nMan City 8/15, Draw 10/3, Inter Milan 21/4\nResult/Both teams to score:\nTo score:\n- Erling Haaland – First 11/4, Last 11/4, Anytime 5/6\n- Kevin de Bruyne – First 17/2, Last 17/2, Anytime 3/1\n- Jeremy Doku – First 10/1, Last 10/1, Anytime 7/2\nAtalanta v Arsenal\nMikel Arteta’s men head into this match against last season’s Europa League winners on the back of an impressive win over Tottenham.\nIt’s the first time these teams have met, and Arsenal are likely to once again be without injured captain Martin Odegaard for the trip to Italy.\nThe Gunners sit second in the Premier League, but have won just one of their last five in this competition.\nThey also face a huge challenge against table-toppers Manchester City on Sunday, which could further impact Arteta’s selection for Thursday night’s fixture.\nDespite their European success last season, Atalanta have struggled for form in Serie A. They currently sit eighth in the league, with six points from four games, making Arsenal favourites for an away win.\nAtalanta 29/10, Draw 14/5, Arsenal 17/20\nResult/Both teams to score:\nTo score:\n- Bukayo Saka – First 11/2, Last 11/2, Anytime 2/1\n- Kai Havertz – First 13/2, Last 13/2, Anytime 9/4\n- Gabriel Martinelli – First 15/2, Last 15/2, Anytime 11/4\nBet £10 and receive £30 in free bets - T&Cs Apply*\nSignificant open account offer T&Cs:\nAvailable to new customers only.
