And on paper, things didn’t look too bad. He finished his final season at Paris Saint-Germain with a career-best tally of 44 goals in all competitions. He then made the semi-finals of the European Championship with France last summer and, a week later, was presented to an adoring Santiago Bernabeu crowd after fulfilling his childhood dream of joining Real Madrid.\nAdvertisement\nBut as he traipsed through the final weeks of his seven-year spell at the Parc des Princes, as he drifted anonymously through a succession of matches at the Euros and as he struggled to find his feet in his early days in the Spanish capital, the thought occurred: when was the last time Mbappe did something that got you out of your seat? When was the last time he left an elite defence in tatters with a single, eviscerating burst of speed? When was the last time he forced the entire footballing world to sit up and take notice?\nThe sparkle in Mbappe’s game had faded quietly but, when it returned, it came back with a bang.\nAway against Atalanta in the Champions League in early December, he brilliantly allowed a pass from Brahim Diaz to run across his body on the edge of the box, taking Marten de Roon out of the game, before bludgeoning the ball into the bottom-left corner of the goal. Facing Barcelona in the following month’s Spanish Super Cup final, he blew past Alejandro Balde with a trademark stepover and coolly clipped a shot beyond Wojciech Szczesny. His hat-trick away to Valladolid a couple of weeks later demonstrated that, contrary to reports of its demise, the combination of lethal pace and dead-eyed finishing with which he first made his name remained fully and thrillingly intact.\nFinally settled in Madrid, fully up to speed physically and increasingly in tune with his new team-mates, the now 26-year-old has been able to freely move through the gears once again.\nSpeed has been part of Mbappe’s footballing armoury ever since his very first steps in the game. But how he has used it, and how it has been utilised by his various coaches, has been a process of constant evolution.\nHis father Wilfried was a football coach and his mother Fayza Lamari a handball player, so Mbappe inherited genetic advantages that predisposed him towards high athletic performance when he was still in the womb.\nAdvertisement\nIn early footage of him as a footballer – as a 10-year-old in the green and white halves of local club AS Bondy, as a sparkling prospect first at the national training centre in Clairefontaine and then in Monaco’s academy – his speed is evident. When he exploded into the professional game with Monaco at the age of just 16, it was the first thing that caught the eye.\nThe Athletic asked Dr David Lunn, senior lecturer in sport and exercise biomechanics at Leeds Beckett University’s Carnegie School of Sport, to review video from Mbappe’s time at Monaco and break down the physical characteristics that enabled him to cross the turf at such pace.\n“From a biomechanical perspective, sprint speed is driven by two key factors: step length (the distance covered from one foot to the next) and step frequency (the number of steps taken per second),” Dr Lunn says. “The footage highlights Mbappe’s ability to outsprint his opponent, primarily due to a longer step length. Multiple examples show him taking a similar number of steps (as his opponent) over the same period of time, but consistently winning the foot race, suggesting longer step length.\n“This longer step length ensures optimal take-off distance (the distance from foot placement at ‘touchdown’ to his centre of mass at take-off), maximising force production. He achieves this through a claw-like action, characterised by strong hip extension that propels him forwards, which is particularly crucial during the acceleration phase of sprinting.”\nFrom a mechanical point of view, Mbappe is precision-engineered for moving at speed.\nWhen Nelson Caldeira first started working with him, however, it wasn’t so much his raw physical pace that stood out as the way he weaponised it. Caldeira was head coach Leonardo Jardim’s assistant at Monaco and in early November 2015, with the boss away on a scouting trip in Argentina, he found himself presiding over a training session that would immediately lodge itself in his memory.\nAdvertisement\n“I remember the impact Kylian had in his very first training session,” he says. “It was an international break, so we were missing a few players, and our B team coach, Souleymane Cisse, said we should have a look at him. Of course, everybody who watches him can see his speed, but what I noticed was the way he would use his upper body to throw a feint before he received the ball and how he would accelerate at exactly the right moment.\n“It’s not just the speed. The impact of his accelerations was much higher because he chose the exact moment when his opponent was unbalanced or changing direction.”\nThe temptation with quick, young forwards is to play them on the wing, but a tactical experiment in an away game against his future employers PSG towards the end of Mbappe’s first season at Monaco revealed how dangerous he could potentially be alongside another centre-forward.\nPlaying off Vagner Love in that March 2016 fixture, the 17-year-old produced an enterprising performance as Monaco won 2-0, inflicting PSG’s first home league defeat in nearly two years. “That’s the story that leads to Kylian playing in a two,” says Caldeira.\nThe following season, with Radamel Falcao now the striker at his side, Mbappe burst across the football firmament like a comet, inspiring Monaco to a stunning Ligue 1 title and a sparkling run to the Champions League semi-finals.\nIn the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium, he catapulted himself to global attention with a brilliantly-taken goal straight off the training ground.\nAs Fabinho aims a lofted pass down the inside-right channel, Falcao comes deep…\n… creating space for Mbappe to run through and score past Willy Caballero.\n“If you’re playing against an opponent with a high defensive line, runs in-behind are very important,” explains Caldeira. “We’d create a zone on the pitch in training and we’d say, ‘This is the area where Falcao needs to come into, approaching the midfielders. If Falcao approaches, this space (in-behind) will be released and Kylian will have space to attack’. We worked on that on a daily basis.”\nMbappe had arrived and no opposition defender was safe.\nAdvertisement\nMbappe’s €180million (then £166m/$200m) transfer to PSG in the summer of 2017, a record fee for a teenager, introduced him to a new club environment, a new set of team-mates and a new role on the pitch.\nWith Neymar, also signed in that summer for a world-record €222m, on the left and Edinson Cavani playing through the middle, Mbappe invariably found himself out on the right for PSG, as shown by this goal in the early stages of a 3-0 win over Marseille in February 2018.\nThe teenager enjoyed a successful first season in the French capital, notably winning a second successive league title, but his goals total dipped from 26 in all competitions the previous campaign to 21. Attacking from wide areas, it turned out, was less straightforward than driving into the box through the middle.\n“The thing is, I expend a lot of energy on the wing,” Mbappe told French newspaper L’Equipe in June 2018. “At Monaco, I played centrally. I might have made intensive runs, but they were 20-metre runs and they finished with a goal. Now, when you’ve come back into the (defensive) block, you do a 65-metre run, you arrive in front of the goalkeeper and your tongue’s hanging out! But you have to remain lucid. Because sometimes you only get one (chance) and if you miss it, that’s what you’re judged on.”\nPlaying wide on the right did not prevent him from making his mark with France at that summer’s World Cup, where his exhilarating sprint through the Argentinian defence in the last 16 – with a top speed clocked at 37km/h – cemented Mbappe’s status as the game’s quickest and deadliest young forward.\nNearly seven years on from that tournament in Russia, he is still to relinquish his crown as football’s sprint king – as demonstrated by this chart put together using data firm SkillCorner’s Game Intelligence model.\nThomas Tuchel, who became PSG head coach in summer 2018, made multiple attempts to field Mbappe in a central position alongside a strike partner – initially Cavani, then Mauro Icardi – but struggled to find a formula that didn’t leave the team dangerously unbalanced.\nAdvertisement\nBy the time the German, now England head coach, left the job in December 2020, it had become apparent that Mbappe was at his happiest on the left, which allowed him to cut inside onto his stronger right foot. With both club and country, it is the area of the pitch he has been drawn towards ever since.\nIn the summer of 2021, Mbappe granted an interview to magazine France Football on the theme of speed. He talked about his childhood love of watching big cats, divulged a fondness for fast cars and said that he had spent time studying footage of the Brazilian striker Ronaldo, who he described as “the master” when it came to off-the-ball movement.\nBy this time, his coach at PSG was Mauricio Pochettino. While waxing lyrical about the joys of life in the fast lane, Mbappe also revealed that the former Tottenham coach had been spending time with him on the training pitch showing him how to… slow down.\n“I needed to improve my finishing by adapting it to my profile,” Mbappe said. “When I arrive in front of a goalkeeper, I’m going at 37-38.5km/h (around 23mph). It’s not exactly the same thing as a player who arrives at 26km/h (16mph). I needed to learn to decelerate a bit as I got closer to goal, so as to better control that speed… I also need to adapt to others. When I’m heading for goal, sometimes I wait for my team-mates a bit, so as not to find myself all alone. That’s another thing that I’m controlling better than before, when my speed sometimes isolated me from the rest of the team.”\nHaving studied footage from this part of Mbappe’s career, both our biomechanics expert Dr Lunn and his MSc Sport and Exercise student Neeraj J N Konwar independently pinpointed deceleration as a weapon the Frenchman has made increasing use of over the years.\n“In later clips, Mbappe seems to shift his sprint posture, showing more of a forward lean, which enhances his ability to apply force in the direction of travel,” Dr Lunn explained. “While maintaining top-end sprint speed, Mbappe also demonstrates the ability to rapidly transition between acceleration and deceleration. This allows him to quickly change direction, outmanoeuvre opponents and create space for shooting opportunities.”\nA member of Pochettino’s coaching staff at PSG, speaking anonymously to protect relationships, told The Athletic: “There’s not much you can explain to Kylian. He understands space, he understands when to receive the ball to feet and he learns actions quicker than anyone else in the world. And when he’s feeling super-fit, his confidence goes over the moon. But what we would say is, ‘When you are in the box, take your time.’\nAdvertisement\n“What makes a difference is what they can produce at the end of the action, when the legs have run out of energy. Something we’ve always worked on is that finishing happens under stress, finishing happens under fatigue. You never finish with fresh legs, unless it’s the first action of the game and it’s a rebound or the second ball from a corner.\n“We worked on the final actions: finishing, trying to put your opponent on the floor or forcing your opponent to turn twice before (shooting). He loved to practise one-v-one. He’d work with other strikers in a group, and with great application, but he loved working on one-v-one actions.”\nLionel Messi’s arrival at the Parc des Princes in summer 2021 created a tactical conundrum that neither Pochettino nor his successor a year later, Christophe Galtier, would prove capable of solving. With Mbappe, Messi and Neymar all assured of a place in the first XI but all reluctant to break a sweat defensively, PSG became a team who would effectively split in half the moment the ball was lost: defenders and midfielders all scrambling to get into their proper out-of-possession shape, forwards disinterestedly watching on from afar.\nWhen Messi first signed, however, Mbappe had outwardly expressed an acceptance that he would have to do some extra legwork on the veteran Argentinian’s behalf. “When you have Messi in your team, you know he needs to do a bit less (defending) in order to have more juice and to be more lucid when it comes to scoring,” he told L’Equipe that first October. “So if you have to do it, you do it. There’s no problem – there’s an established hierarchy. I’m happy to run when Messi walks, no problem!”\nThe choice of language was revealing. The word Mbappe used to describe the state that Messi needed to be in to score goals – ‘lucid’ – was the same one he had used in his interview with the same publication three years earlier when he spoke about the difficulty of remaining clear-headed in front of goal after charging into the box from the wing. The implication that lucidity will inevitably be sacrificed when a forward commits to playing a full part in his team’s defensive work might help to explain why Mbappe has often seemed to down tools the moment his teams cede possession.\nCaldeira, for one, is sympathetic.\n“He’s not a player that can make efforts all the time,” says the former Monaco coach. “It wasn’t the case that Kylian didn’t understand or didn’t want to (defend). But the offensive actions that he is so good at are very demanding from a physical point of view. He needs recovery time.”\nAdvertisement\nUnlike other players of his generation, Mbappe has tended not to employ the services of a personal fitness coach. When he decided that he needed to tune up physically in summer 2022, he did so in fitness sessions back at Monaco’s La Turbie training ground that were overseen by his father, Wilfried, alongside his younger brother, Ethan (then a PSG team-mate, now at Lille), and his older adoptive brother, Jires Kembo Ekoko (formerly of Rennes).\nThat 2022-23 season was split in two by the World Cup in the November and December, but Mbappe seemed to take the convoluted campaign in his stride, scoring eight goals to carry France to within a whisker of back-to-back glory in Qatar and then returning to propel PSG to yet another Ligue 1 title.\nMbappe generally started games on the left at that World Cup, but frequently found himself shifting to centre-forward – most notably before scoring his historic hat-trick against Argentina in the final.\nHe protested about being asked to play as “un pivot” with his back to goal by Galtier at PSG, notoriously captioning an Instagram story photograph with the sardonic hashtag “#pivotgang” after a dreary 0-0 draw at Reims in October 2022. But as time has gone on, it is a role he has gradually – albeit perhaps a little begrudgingly – come to embrace.\nHaving started what would prove to be his final PSG season in his preferred left-wing role, Mbappe found himself switched to centre-forward by new coach Luis Enrique during a tactical reshuffle in the second half of a Champions League group-stage draw at home against Newcastle United in the November. This new system enabled Luis Enrique to deploy Bradley Barcola and Ousmane Dembele in their preferred roles either side of Mbappe, and as the chart below shows, PSG’s new centre-forward accepted the assignment, coming short to facilitate his team’s build-up play with more frequency than ever before.\nMbappe’s evolution into a more traditional central striker has only accelerated since his move to Spain.\nWith Madrid’s left flank the preferred domain of Vinicius Junior, the Frenchman has learnt to forage for openings in the inside-left channel (see earlier heatmap), while his runs in-behind (witness his infamous tally of eight offsides against Barcelona in October) and into the box to attack crosses from wide areas are both on the up.\nMbappe’s opening goal in a 2-0 win against Real Betis in September served to illustrate the extent to which he is now operating as a penalty-box predator.\nAdvertisement\nWith the ball wide on the right, he takes up a position in the penalty area and within the width of the six-yard box.\nAs Rodrygo drives infield from the right, Mbappe turns his back to goal in order to open himself up to the play…\n… before spinning in behind to collect Federico Valverde’s flick and score.\nLike all the great football speedsters who have gone before, the time will come when Mbappe has to adapt to the loss of his searing top-end pace.\nWith the France captain still 10 months shy of his 27th birthday, that day doesn’t look likely to arrive any time soon. But the transformation in his game that it will inevitably demand might already be taking shape.\n(Top photo: Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)",
