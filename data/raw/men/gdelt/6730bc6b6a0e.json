A coach representing a club of this size must be one with the ability to bring this team to the levels we demand and give us the titles we desire.\"\nAccording to football transfer journalist Fabrizio Romano, this winning coach could well be Mourinho.\n“Benfica are in advanced talks with José Mourinho after Bruno Lage got sacked overnight,” Romano wrote.\n“Understand Mourinho has opened doors to Benfica move as he wants to return to coaching immediately.\n“The agreement could be sealed soon,” he added.\nIf Mourinho were to sign with the club before the weekend, his first game back would fall on quite a coincidental date: Benfica is set to play AVS Futebol on September 20 - 25 years to the day after the club first appointed Mourinho in 2000.\nMourinho first came to prominence at Benfica's domestic rivals Porto, winning the UEFA Cup in 2003 and Champions League in 2004.\nHe joined Chelsea soon after that Champions League success and steered the Blues to Premier League titles in 2005 and 2006, plus the 2015 crown in his second stint in charge.\nHe was a Champions League winner at Inter Milan in 2010 and, while he was unable to restore Manchester United to greatness, he did guide them to the Europa League title in 2017.\nHis time at Tottenham ended without a trophy, though he was sacked days before the team were due to take on Manchester City in the 2021 League Cup final.\nHe was a Conference League winner at Roma in 2022 before taking charge at Fenerbahce in the summer of 2024.",
