  "body_text": "The Athletic has live coverage of Ruben Amorim’s sacking by Manchester United.\nIt was difficult to find many people who were speaking positively about Ruben Amorim’s fortunes at Manchester United back on September 1.\nFour days earlier, 20-time English champions United, one of the great clubs in world football, had been eliminated from the Carabao Cup by Grimsby Town, who play in League Two, English football’s fourth tier. Noise around Amorim was at an all-time high as he approached a year in charge at Old Trafford, and little of it was positive.\nChicago Fire assistant coach Filipe Celikkaya was a rare exception.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s not about how you win that will make you succeed. It’s how you pass the difficult times,” Celikkaya, who managed the reserve team at Sporting CP during Amorim’s tenure as first-team head coach at the Lisbon club, told The Athletic that day. “It’s the fidelity, to be focused on the process. One of the most important things is the values and the objectives and the long-term vision of the club. And even if you have two bad games, three bad games, you need to stick with it. Even though you have pressure, you need to stick with it.”\nAlmost three months on, Celikkaya’s words are relevant again.\nAfter a much-improved run where United went five games unbeaten in the Premier League, with Amorim named the top flight’s manager of the month for October, that streak ended with a limp 1-0 defeat at home against Everton on Monday. That Everton played with 10 men for 80 minutes following an early red card did not reflect well on Amorim and his tactics.\nThe Athletic spoke to Celikkaya again over the November international break, so before that loss, and he explained why his faith in his old Sporting colleague has not wavered.\n“It’s a matter of process,” the 40-year-old says. “People think that the coach is about tactics. I don’t think it’s just tactics. It’s much more than that. When you enter a club and you need to make some changes, the changes are not only on the field, in training, on a daily basis. It’s all about rules. It’s about ambition. It’s about putting everyone on the same path.”\nIn summer 2020, Amorim recruited longtime acquaintance Celikkaya to lead Sporting’s reserves. Celikkaya had spent the 2019-20 season as assistant manager with Ukrainian title winners Shakhtar Donetsk. They competed in the group stage of the Champions League before dropping into the Europa League, where they reached the semi-finals.\nAdvertisement\n“Sporting wasn’t in the Champions League that season,” Celikkaya said. “So I left Shakhtar as a national champion, playing in the Champions League (Shakhtar had qualified for the group stage of the 2020-21 edition), to go to Sporting to build something together.”\nWhat they built is impressive. Amorim’s senior team won two league titles before his departure to Manchester, helped by a solid pathway from Celikkaya’s reserves.\n“One of the objectives was to put Sporting back at the highest level, looking into the academy and promoting young players to the first team,” Celikkaya says.\nWingers Geovany Quenda and Geny Catamo are among those who successfully progressed to the first team. Quenda, 18, will move to Chelsea in 2026 for a fee in the region of €45million to €50m (£39.5m-£43.8m/$52.1m-$57.9m at the current rates), where he will join Dario Essugo, 20, another former Celikkaya pupil who joined the Londoners for £18.5m (€21m at the current rate) this summer.\n“(We were) building the foundations again, and the values of the club, demanding of the players — but not only the players,” Celikkaya says. “It’s a club where a lot of people work. So the demanding must be of everyone.”\nThis week’s defeat to Everton shows how much more demanding still needs to happen at United. “These five weeks everyone was praising our evolution, and I am always saying the same things: we are not near,” Amorim told journalists after the match. “They were the better team. We deserved to lose. We didn’t play with the right intensity.”\nCelikkaya describes himself and Amorim as “demanding” but with “empathy and passion”. He recalls the strict standards placed on Sporting’s players around punctuality and effort from a young age.\n“The players that are now in Man United, they have the mentality of the coach,” he says. “They will work. I’m sure about that. The players that are not in United (anymore), it’s because they don’t share the same values. And the values of Manchester United are this: every day at the top level, to perform at the top level, to win titles. It takes time.\nAdvertisement\n“You need to suffer in training to be ready for the game. That’s the most important thing. And I share the same mentality.”\nCelikkaya has ambitions of being a head coach, and of working in the Premier League, but for now, he is part of a rebuilding project at the Fire.\nThe MLS club have a new training facility and are also building a soccer-specific stadium, which is expected to open in 2028. They appointed former USMNT manager Gregg Berhalter as director of football and head coach in 2024, with Celikkaya joining as an assistant in January this year. Chicago have just finished a promising campaign where they qualified for the end-of-season title play-offs for the first time since 2017.\n“We wanted to capture the attention of the city and play football that resonated with the fans,” Berhalter said in November. “We did that. We played really attacking soccer, our games were entertaining, and we scored goals. We set the foundation, but we need to improve.”\n“Creating that identity, that culture, that process takes time,” Celikkaya says. “(Reaching the play-offs) was a big step. I’m enjoying building up a culture, an identity, and putting the club in the right place to win a championship, an MLS Cup.”\nCelikkaya and Amorim were briefly reunited in the summer, when United shared the Fire’s training facilities during the Chicago leg of their three-game pre-season tour in the United States. Since their success at Sporting, both men have left their birth country of Portugal for new leagues and challenges, but Celikkaya believes much of Amorim’s management remains similar.\n“When you have different players, different groups, you need to adapt to different people,” he says. “But the authenticity, how you coach, is still the same because it’s you. You don’t change the person because you are in different clubs. When they wanted to sign him, it was because of the way he coached, the way he presented himself.\nAdvertisement\n“He never hides behind a wall. He shows humanity, and that creates connections and stronger connections. Even when you have small fights. And I think the players believe in what he’s doing.”\nAmorim will adapt, but he will not change. To Celikkaya, who has seen him at his most successful, that is no bad thing.",
