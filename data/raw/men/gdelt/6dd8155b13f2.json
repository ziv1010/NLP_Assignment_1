She also helped England retain the European Championship this summer.\nIn the Womens Young Player of the Year category, Chelsea are represented by Thompson and Kaptein. The former has shone in her first season in English football, with the Americans six goals making her our top scorer in the WSL.\nKaptein, meanwhile, has continued to build on her impressive first season with the Blues after being nominated for last years Ballon dOr.\nOur final nominee is Chelsea stalwart and womens captain Bright, who has been nominated for the Womens PFA Player in the Community Champion award, which honours player-led community initiatives during 2025.\nThe winners of all the categories will be revealed at the 2026 London Football Awards ceremony at Exhibition White City on Thursday 5 March.\nGood luck Blues!\n( Press Release Image: https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/350350/350350-1.png )\nWebWireID350350\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.
