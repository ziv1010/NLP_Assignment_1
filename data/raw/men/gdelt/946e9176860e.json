  "body_text": "Manchester United got dominated by Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday but escaped the Vitality Stadium with a 2-2 draw.\nThe hosts had 20 shots as compared to United’s eight and could have scored a lot more if not for some fine goalkeeping from Andre Onana and some poor finishing.\nThe Cherries took advantage of Erik ten Hag’s poor tactics and easily bypassed the initial United press who were far too easy to play through.\nThe same inadequacies have been on display since the season opener and it seems the Dutchman will not change and more and more players are becoming disillusioned with how the season is fizzling out.\nGarnacho hits out at substitution decision\nUnited were trying to compete for a place in next season’s Champions League but now look likely to finish in their lowest-ever position since the Premier League started.\nApart from a flawed playing style, his treatment of certain players has also caused division among the players. It started with Jadon Sancho accusing the manager of making him a scapegoat while favouring the ineffective Antony.\nGarnacho’s liked tweets 🤯🤯🤯 pic.twitter.com/AEyW1hmrjz\n— Football Tweet ⚽ (@Football__Tweet) April 13, 2024\nNow Alejandro Garnacho has liked two divisive social media comments which hint at the former Ajax coach preferring Marcus Rashford over the Argentine despite his disastrous displays this season.\nOn Saturday, despite hardly offering any threat, it was the Mancunian who stayed on while Garnacho was subbed off with the manager pointing to defensive lapses on the right side.\n“I think we had to repair over that right side. We didn’t play well, the spaces were there in possession, we had to bring a sub there,” the manager said after the game.\nThe 19-year-old did contribute to Bournemouth’s opening goal but he did make amends with the equaliser and was unlucky to be subbed off.\nHe has not been on the top of his game recently but has still produced more consistently as compared to the England international.\nEven Amad Diallo, who came on in the second half, deserves more chances. It would have been more apt for the Ivorian and Garnacho to be on the wings.\nEtH backing the wrong stars?\nThe manager also faced criticism for his continued backing of Scott McTominay earlier in the season and for not picking Raphael Varane in the first half of the campaign.\nThe Manchester Evening News journalist Samuel Luckhurst also pointed out brewing tensions on the field between skipper Bruno Fernandes and Andre Onana over the team’s ineffectiveness while playing out from the back.\nFernandes and Onana have been bickering over whether to play it out from the back or go long. Ten Hag told Fernandes to calm down but he wasn't having it, so Ten Hag had a moan at him. Fernandes ended it by wagging his finger. #mufc\n— Samuel Luckhurst (@samuelluckhurst) April 13, 2024\nThe captain and the manager did not see eye to eye with the ultimate decision and with rumours of Antony not being happy with his lack of minutes, a mini-rebellion against Ten Hag has erupted ahead of United’s crucial FA Cup semifinal against Coventry City at Wembley.\nCasemiro has revealed his displeasure at the current season, as has the captain and Ten Hag’s goodwill among fans is going down rapidly.\nThe team is losing motivation fast and a disappointing ending to the season awaits for fans. And if further bad blood erupts between the manager and players, things could turn ugly even before the season ends.
