  "body_text": "In early summer, the American sports calendar starts to slow down. The National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL) finals are winding down. Football is yet to truly ramp up. Baseball is ongoing, but in a 162-game season, it's tough to remain invested at all times; there's talk of the dog days of summer dragging on for a reason.\nThis year, though, there's an extra addition to the calendar—the FIFA Club World Cup. The tournament will feature a newly expanded field, bringing more clubs to the United States ahead of the 2026 World Cup.\nAnd while there's room to debate the wisdom of fitting another event into a crowded football calendar, the Club World Cup will provide an opportunity to check out some big-time players from around the sport.\nFeeling a bit spoiled for choice and unsure of who to focus on? We've got you covered.\nLionel Messi (Inter Miami)\nWhen it comes to individual attractions, the living legend is arguably the Club World Cup's biggest draw. Messi has accomplished just about everything possible on the football pitch and, despite getting up there in age, he's still going strong.\nThe Inter Miami attacker should also be worth watching regardless of your stylistic preferences. Want to see goals? He's capable of finding the back of the net. Prefer silky smooth dribbling? He's got you covered.\nAnd when you consider the fact that we probably don't have much longer to watch Messi on the global stage, there's even more reason to tune in.\nErling Haaland (Manchester City)\nPicking attacking players for this list can feel a bit cheap. They generally score goals, and that makes them exciting to watch. Haaland, though, is a unique talent.\nDoes the Norwegian score goals? Of course, and few are better at putting the ball past the goalkeeper. What's arguably more interesting, though, is how he goes about his work. Haaland barely touches the ball during open play, but makes those touches count. He's also big, strong and fast; if he was playing North American sports, we'd have long since labeled him a unicorn.\nKylian Mbappé (Real Madrid)\nOn paper, the move from Paris to Madrid was supposed to be what lifted Mbappé's career to the next level. In reality, though, things haven't gone according to plan, and the French forward hasn't always looked his best at striker (and shoehorning three left-wingers into a front three probably compromised Real Madrid's performance.)\nWith that being said, though, Xabi Alonso has replaced Carlo Ancelotti on the sidelines; will that change Mbappé's fortunes?\nAnd, from a pure entertainment perspective, there are few things more fun than seeing a pacey striker break through the defense and bare down on the goal.\nOusmane Dembélé (PSG)\nYou might be thinking, \"Another French forward, how original.\"\nBut even though Dembélé might not have the name recognition of Mbappé, he's worth watching based on his current form. The current PSG man was always someone with plenty of talent and potential, but injuries and inconsistency kept him from putting it all together.\nDuring the second half of the 2024-25 campaign, though, he stepped up as a genuine game-changer and helped PSG complete a treble that included the elusive Champions League crown. Dembélé is also in the conversation for the Ballon d'Or, which honors the previous season's best player.\nWill a strong Club World Cup be a key to that title? Probably not, but a strong performance could provide that extra boost that places him at the front of the voters' minds.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold (Real Madrid)\nAfter four attackers, we finally have someone who plays further back on the pitch.\nAlexander-Arnold made headlines this year after running down his contract at Liverpool to join Real Madrid as a free agent. The right back isn't always the most natural defender, but his playmaking ability is second to none.\nThe Club World Cup will provide an early glimpse of how he'll fit into Alonso's system. Under Ancelotti, the front three didn't really have much defensive responsibility; that, however, would force Alexander-Arnold to sit back and highlight his weaknesses rather than his strengths.\nAnd, if that sounds a bit tactically nuanced for you, just sit back and watch him uncork a few perfected weighted through balls. There are few things more satisfying than watching the pass roll just out of the opposition's reach into the attacker's stride.\nHonorable Mentions\nRodri (Manchester City): The Spanish midfielder's game isn't flashy, but he's indispensable for City. It's unclear how much he'll play as he returns from an ACL injury, but it will be interesting to watch him fit back into the club's midfield. Will he have lost a step?\nVinicius Jr. (Real Madrid): Mbappé has stolen many of the headlines in Madrid, but Vini Jr. is still a world-class attacker in his own right. If you want to see individual excellence in and around the box, he's worth the watch.\nEstêvão Willian (Palmeiras): Want to see the next Brazilian wonderkid before he (potentially) bursts onto the European scene? Well, this is your chance.\nWillianwill actually join Chelsea this summer, but the Club World Cup will be his last ride with his current Brazilian club. That provides the perfect opportunity for him to break out all of his skills and put on a show.\nLiam Delap (Chelsea): From a future Chelsea player to a current one, Delap arrived at Stamford Bridge this summer to compete for the striker job.\nWill the Club World Cup determine who's the starting Number 9 when the Premier League campaign begins? Probably not, but it will be interesting to see how Delap starts fitting into the squad.\nThemba Zwane (Mamelodi Sundowns): Part of the fun of big tournaments is getting to see players who would normally fall in your blind spots. And with all respect to the South African game, it's safe to say that Zwane isn't a household name for most North Americans.\nHe's a legendary player for the Mamelodi Sundowns, though, finding success for both club and country. It will be interesting to see what he can do on the global stage.\nFranco Mastantuono (River Plate): While South America obviously has a rich soccer scene, many fans don't really see those players until they make their way into the biggest European leagues. The Club World Cup, however, will bring Mastantuono to a larger audience this summer.\nThe 17-year-old Argentine midfielder is far from the finished product, but he's already playing for one of his home country's biggest clubs and has appeared for the senior national team.\nNow's your chance to say you've watched him before his big move abroad.\nThomas Müller (Bayern Munich): On the opposite end of the spectrum from Mastantuono, Müller is 35 years old and playing his final matches for the Bavarian club.\nIs the most exciting player to watch? Probably not, and it's unclear exactly how much we'll even see him on the pitch. But Müller is incredibly talented with a unique skill set that boils down to using space and scoring goals.\nIf nothing else, this is a chance to close out the main chapter of his career in style.",
