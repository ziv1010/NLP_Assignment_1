Andre Onana’s horror pass led to Casemiro getting a red card and the Turkish champions winning a penalty, which Mauro Icardi missed but quickly atoned for when racing through to dink home.\n“We need to get some points now if we want to play in Champions League after the group stage,” Hojlund said ahead of matches home and away to former club FC Copenhagen.\n“I am looking forward to playing against them because it’s a former club, my brothers are playing there, and I have a big heart for Copenhagen.\n“But now I play in Manchester United and we need to get some points out of them.”\nUnited players kept their heads down as they walked through interview area after a chastening loss in which Hojlund’s display was the only highlight.\nThe Old Trafford giants went for promise over a proven goalscorer when signing the 20-year-old international from Atalanta in the summer and he enjoyed his breakout moment on Tuesday.\n“It’s about getting in there,” Hojlund told MUTV. “For me, I always try to get into the dangerous positions.\n“Today I got the ball three times (there), if you count the offside goal as well.\n“I’ve been bought to be scoring goals and now I was happy to score two today.\n“Marcus (Rashford) and I talk to each other and he knows that I’m going to be there.\n“He knows that I can keep up with his pace when we go on the counter and we saw a glimpse of that today.\n“(The second goal) was a good feeling. I got cheated a little bit before because of the offside (with my second goal) but, yeah, it was an incredible goal.\n“I like to call that a signature Rasmus goal – on the left side, running a lot so, yeah, it was nice.”",
