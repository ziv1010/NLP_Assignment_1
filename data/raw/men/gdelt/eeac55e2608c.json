  "body_text": "Real Madrid head coach Carlo Ancelotti has admitted that he does not regularly speak to Eden Hazard but insisted that his relationship with the Belgium forward was not “cold”.\nHazard stated on Monday that he and Ancelotti do not talk to one another.\nThe 32-year-old has made just seven appearances in all competitions for Real this season and has not featured in La Liga or the Champions League since returning from the 2022 World Cup.\nAdvertisement\n“The relationship is not cold,” Ancelotti said. “Look, you have to appreciate both things: Hazard has been honest, because I don’t talk to him much, it’s the truth.\n“Talking is a question of character, you feel more comfortable with some people than with others. But the most important thing for me is that if we don’t talk a lot and if he doesn’t play a lot, he respects me, just like I respect him in the same exact way\n“Why doesn’t he play? Because there is a lot of competition and in his position there is a player who is contributing a lot, which is Vinicius.”\nAncelotti was vague when asked if he would be “counting” on Hazard next year.\n“For next year, I am counting on the players that the club puts at my disposal,” the Italian added.\nHazard joined Real from Chelsea for an initial €100million (£88.3m) in the summer of 2019 but his time in Spain has been disrupted by injury.\nGO DEEPER\nHazard was Real Madrid's record signing. Now he's an outsider who looks set to leave\nSpeaking to Belgian broadcaster RTBF on Monday, Hazard said: “There’s respect between Ancelotti and me. But, I’m not going to say we talk to each other, because we don’t. But there will always be respect. I have to have respect a guy like Ancelotti. For what he represents for football, and for what he’s done in his career.”\nReal return to action on Wednesday when they face Liverpool in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.\nThe Spanish side will be without David Alaba due to a hamstring injury but otherwise have a fully fit squad for the clash. Alvaro Rodriguez has been named in the squad despite not training with the first team on Tuesday and Ferland Mendy returns after being sidelined for six weeks with a thigh injury.\nDespite taking a 5-2 lead into the second leg, Ancelotti said his side will not just sit back and defend their advantage.\n“It’s quite clear, simple: don’t make calculations and try to play the best we can,” Ancelotti said. “We have to try to play a game like the first leg. We want to play from the first minute with maximum intensity and enthusiasm.\nAdvertisement\n“We haven’t talked a lot, we haven’t looked much at the first leg, where we did a lot of things well, but mostly offensively. That’s what we have to approach, we’re not going to approach a game with the fact that we have the advantage. We will want to attack. We think more about attacking than defending”.\nGO DEEPER\nReal Madrid vs Liverpool: Who makes our experts' combined XIs?\n(Photo: Getty Images)",
