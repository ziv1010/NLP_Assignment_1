On the morning of Thursday 7 August, full of Barça-related nominations, the club could not be left out of the running for Club of the Year—for both the women’s and men’s teams. The trajectories of Pere Romeu’s side and Hansi Flick’s squad this past season have earned them this double nomination from France Football magazine.\nIt’s becoming something of a tradition for Barça Femení to be nominated for this award. The team has scooped the prize in each of the last two editions: 2024 and 2023. The constant expansion of the club’s trophy cabinet plays a big role in these golden accolades, as the blaugranes continue to collect titles one after another. This past season, they claimed a domestic treble with victories in the Copa de la Reina, Liga F, and Spanish Super Cup. Strong credentials as they go up against Chelsea, OL Lyon, Orlando Pride, and Arsenal for the honour.\nThe men’s team under Hansi Flick matched that achievement. With dazzling, passionate football, the culers captured the Spanish Super Cup, La Liga, and the Copa del Rey. More than enough merit to be in contention for Men’s Club of the Year, alongside Botafogo and others.\nIn addition, both Barça teams came agonisingly close to European glory. Pere Romeu’s side lost the Champions League final to Arsenal, while Flick’s men fell at the very last moment in the semi-finals. Still, there’s no doubt that Barça Femení and the men's team are doing things right—and these two new nominations from France Football are a clear reflection of that.\n- label.aria.viber Viber\n- label.aria.whatsapp WhatsApp\n- label.aria.twitter Twitter\n- label.aria.facebook Facebook\n- label.aria.messenger Messenger\n- label.aria.link label.aria.tick Copy link",
