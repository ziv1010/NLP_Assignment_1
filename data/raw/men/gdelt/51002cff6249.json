Local engagement thrived through fruitful collaborations with ambassadors.\nIn 2025, 1xBet even organized an ambassador tour to Morocco for CAF events, demonstrating the brand’s deep ties to African football.\nSpotlight on Women’s Empowerment: 1xWoman\nA true highlight was the growth of 1xWoman, a pioneering initiative supporting women in sport, on and off the field.\n1xWoman delivered live podcast, educational content, to inspire girls and women, coaches, journalists, and creators.\nThis movement will continue in 2026 and will not only support careers, but will change perceptions and build a network of support, proving that investing in women means investing in the future of sports.\n1xCup and Social Impact\nThe 1xCup project, together with the expansion of women’s initiatives, underlined 1xBet’s role as a driver of social progress and community growth.\nLocal tournaments and educational programs not only celebrated sporting talent but also supported youth development and inclusion, reflecting the brand’s ongoing commitment to making a difference off the pitch.\nStandout Promotions, Technology & Fan Engagement\nNigerian fans enjoyed a year packed with excitement as 1xBet rolled out headline promos like WOW Promo and Big Match, drawing record participation and awarding big cash prizes that fueled a true sense of community.\nThe brand’s mobile app, the Hyper Bonus (now up to 600,000 NGN), and ongoing user interface improvements made the 1xBet platform more accessible and rewarding than ever, while dedicated customer support ensured a seamless betting experience.\nAlongside these features, 1xBet Nigeria kept fans engaged throughout 2025 with a vibrant calendar of social media promotions and interactive contests, nearly 30 unique competitions that rewarded activity, creativity, and passion. Around 400 winners received exclusive promo codes, prizes, and special experiences, with many contests organized in collaboration with local partners and influencers to amplify the excitement and build a strong, connected community.\nAFCON Anticipation & The Pulse of Nigerian Sport\nAs the official sponsor, 1xBet is proudly at the center of anticipation for AFCON 2025, Africa’s biggest football event. The brand’s sponsorship fuels new opportunities for athletes and fans, cementing its reputation as a trusted ally of Nigerian sport.\nFootball remains the top passion, followed by basketball, esports, local leagues, and tennis. The UEFA Champions League Final and FIFA’s major tournaments were key sporting moments, generating nationwide excitement. The 1xBet brand further united fans by launching match viewing zones in Ibadan, bringing the thrill of live events to local communities.\nLooking Ahead\n2026 promises even more: the next edition of 1xCup, new ambassador projects, expanded viewing zones, the continued support of women in sports and more on responsible betting.\nWith the close of 2025, 1xBet thanks all fans, partners, and ambassadors for their passion and trust!\n1xBet’s focus on innovation, and fan connection means Nigeria can look forward to a future where sport, community, and opportunity go hand in hand.",
