The main issue surrounding the documentary at the time of writing is that no streaming services have yet secured the rights to broadcast.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nDisney+ were, and still are, believed to be leading the race to secure ownership rights, although no such deal is in place just yet.\nWhen is it expected to be released?\nThe documentary was initially expected to be released in August 2024 to align with the start of the new Premier League season.\nHowever, while this has not yet been denied, the lack of ownership confirmation means this timeframe is not yet confirmed either.\nMore Liverpool stories:\nLiverpool make key transfer decision ahead of new manager's arrival: report\n'If I speak there will be fire' – Mohamed Salah and Jurgen Klopp clash as Liverpool title hopes fade with draw at West Ham\nDarwin Nunez warned over Liverpool future as forward set to ‘lose biggest ally’\nJames Ridge is a freelance journalist based in the UK.
