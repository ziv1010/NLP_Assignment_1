  "body_text": "Fresh from a resounding victory over Brighton on Friday night, our Gunners turn their focus back to the UEFA Women's Champions League.\nWe travel to Italy to take on a Juventus side unbeaten in the past four games, with a win meaning we overtake them in UWCL Group C.\nLAST TIME AROUND\nWe last met Juventus in a Champions League group stage just two seasons ago, when they were still led by former Arsenal manager Joe Montemurro, and we went unbeaten against the Italian side.\nFor the away leg at Allianz Stadium, the scoresheet was an all-Dutch affair: Lineth Beerensteyn opened the scoring for Juventus before Vivianne Miedema headed home to equalise ten minutes later.\nMiedema scored again in the reverse fixture as we ran out 1-0 winners at Emirates Stadium in December 2022.\nWHAT THE MANAGERS SAY\nSlegers on Juventus: \"It’s a different kind of football than what we usually play against in the WSL. We're expecting them to make it really hard for us in the way they defend.\n\"From a WSL perspective, it's unorthodox. They're a little bit more player-for-player in the way they play. So that's a new challenge for us, and we’ve tried to prepare the girls as best as possible to be able to exploit this defending system in the best way.\"\nCanzi on us: “Arsenal are a side in good health right now, they’ve overcome a tough period and they have a lot of quality on an individual and team level. They have their way of playing despite having changed coach recently, and they’re a team with a lot of strengths and not many weaknesses.\n\"We’ll take them on by playing our game, we’ve worked on our style of play in these last few months and by now we have our own identity both with and without the ball, so we’ll take them on by looking to play to our strengths, but aware of theirs too.\"\nMATCH OFFICIALS\nReferee: Jelena Cvetković\nAssistant referees: Ivana Jovanovic and Aleksandra Kostić\nFourth official: Jelena Pejković\nTEAM NEWS\nAfter Mariona Caldentey missed Friday's clash with Brighton & Hove Albion, Renee confirmed that she was back in contention for Juventus: \"It was a little problem but she was back in full training today. It was a muscle problem.\"\nLaura Wienroither and Lotte Wubben-Moy also travelled to Italy with the squad.\nHOW TO WATCH\nOur Champions League clash kicks off at 5.45pm UK (6.45pm local time) and is available to watch via the DAZN website.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
