That's definitely the case.\n\"We have other reasons for an optimistic view because of the atmosphere our people created in the last home game.... All these kinds of things are absolutely the basis for a fantastic future so we don't have to make it bigger than it is. It's a football season.\n\"We didn't deliver what everybody wanted and everybody expected, rightly so, but we are still really united and that's the good thing about it.\"\nKlopp acknowledged Liverpool would take a financial hit as a result of their failure to qualify for the Champions League but said he was still looking forward to next season.\n\"From a financial point of view that's the only problem really,\" he said. \"That's a big problem in football, I know that. But besides that we have European nights next year.\n\"Instead of Tuesday, Wednesday, it's a Thursday. Who cares? Great games, atmosphere, we have the chance to do it all.\n\"The FA Cup will happen again, the League Cup will happen again, so great, we have the chance to do that. Obviously the Premier League is there as well so let's give it a go.\n\"When everything goes in the right direction it's always easy to feel this togetherness. If it's not going in the right direction it's much more challenging. I didn't want to prove that point but we did and for me that's the trophy we won this year.\"\n© 2023 AFP",
