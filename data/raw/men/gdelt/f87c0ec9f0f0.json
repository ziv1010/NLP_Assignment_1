  "body_text": "Enzo Maresca confirmed that Cole Palmer will undergo a scan after missing Chelsea’s Premier League defeat to Arsenal with a muscle injury.\nPalmer has endured a frustrating period following another impressive start to the season, failing to score in his last ten appearances in all competitions.\nAnd the 22-year-old was unable to put an end to that poor form on Sunday after being ruled out with an injury sustained in training late last week.\nMissing their talisman, Chelsea fell to a 1-0 defeat at the Emirates, with Mikel Merino’s first-half header proving the difference in a game devoid of attackng quality.\nPalmer was set to go away on international duty next week having been called up to Thomas Tuchel’s first England squad.\nHowever, Maresca hinted that the midfielder may now be unavailable after his latest knock.\n‘I don’t think so (that Palmer will be available for England) to be honest because his injury was from yesterday’s (Saturday’s) session,’ the Italian said post-match.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

It could be good.’\nMore Trending\nMaresca, however, rejected the notion that it was Palmer’s absence that cost his team on Sunday and pointed to several other injuries within their attacking line that have also inhibited their creativity in the final third.\n‘No, to be honest, I didn’t have this feeling because probably if Noni [Madueke] was there, or Nico [Jackson] was there, then probably the game is different.\n‘It’s not just about one player. When I say we cannot rely on Cole, it’s correct to say because you cannot rely on one player.\n‘It’s about the team and don’t give too much pressure on Cole.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Jamie Carragher tells Liverpool to sign two players after Carabao Cup final defeat to Newcastle\nMORE: Mohamed Salah sets unwanted record as Liverpool star flops in Carabao Cup final",
