Incredible energy, amazing people & a night to remember thank you for having me.'\nThere was also a set by Manchester-based house music DJ Lewis Barlow, 'official DJ' for the Blues, who said it had been a 'full garden takeover'.\nUltrabeat had a number two chart hit in 2003, with a cover of Pretty Green Eyes.\nAs well as the music, there was a nod to the footballer's pastime- with 'Foden bait shop' stall filled with sweet treats, and a fish themed cake.\nEntertainment also included a 'bucking bronco' and son Ronnie, six, even performed on a drum kit.\nA post on Ronnie's Instagram page – followed by four million people – said: 'The best night ever for my dad's surprise fishing themed birthday party Thank you to everyone who came and made it such a special night.'\nPhil Foden's family threw a 'surprise' early birthday party at his five-bedroom lakeside mansion\nThe party featured music from singer Holly Ellison, who was once a finalist on The Voice\nAs well as the music, there was a nod to the footballer's pastime- with 'Foden bait shop' stall filled with sweet treats, and a fish themed cake\nThe celebrations came days after heartbreak for Foden, who turns 25 on Wednesday and his teammates after they lost 1-0 to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup Final at Wembley.\nCity, currently third, travel to face Fulham at Craven Cottage today in their final league game of what has been a disappointing season – by their recent standards.\nPosts on TikTok and Instagram show several dozen people, believed to be family members, partying in the garden of the £1m country home.\nFoden - who was in dressed-down attire for the party, wearing a black tracksuit and silver chain - and his family previously faced complaints from neighbours over loud parties at their former address in Prestbury.\nBut people living close to their new home today said Foden and his family have been 'good neighbours' - and that they weren't disturbed by the birthday celebrations.\nOne said: 'We were away when the party happened but, honestly, you don't hear a thing. They're good neighbours'.\nAnother added: 'They couldn't be better. We've heard nothing since they've been here.'\nThe party came days after Foden stepped out with his long-term girlfriend Rebecca Cooke for City great Kevin De Bruyne's leaving party in Manchester.\nDressed in all-black for that occasion, Rebecca picked a plunging, sleeveless jumpsuit that showed off her cleavage, toned midriff and golden tan, as Rebecca also wore a big smile while posing for pictures with her footballer boyfriend.\nTheir most recent appearance came after the couple sparked engagement rumours when Rebecca was spotted wearing a large diamond ring on her ring finger in February.\nAt the time, it was reported that the Premier League star whisked Rebecca away on a romantic trip to Paris for New Year's Eve, where he reportedly proposed.\nThe party came a week after Foden stepped out with his long-term girlfriend Rebecca Cooke for City great Kevin De Bruyne's leaving party in Manchester\nTwelve months ago, Phil Foden was on top of the world, scooping the Premier League Player of the Year award having just fired his Manchester City side to a fourth consecutive league title.\nThe then-23-year-old had scored a brace against West Ham on the final day - sticking one in the top corner from 35 yards out - and the world was finally his oyster. The Euros with England. Hopes of another Treble. The rest.\nExcept it didn't work out that way. Foden started every game for England but struggled out in Germany. He would have a slow start to the season with City and endure a campaign light years away from his last. It was all, simply, going wrong.\nEarlier this season, Foden blamed 'mental fatigue' for his poor form. 'I just need a few weeks off it without playing football and obviously I can't get it at the moment,' he said.\nNow Foden has been left out Thomas Tuchel's second England squad on the back of fatigue and an ankle injury and will be able to enjoy some time off before the Club World Cup with City next month.\nThat could mean more time at home with his family. Still only 24, Foden has three children with Ms Cooke - son Ronnie, born in 2019, a daughter born in 2021 and another child born during Euro 2024.\nLast month, Foden's old home - where neighbours include Slade singer Noddy Holder, TV antiques expert David Dickinson as well as his former Manchester City team-mate Kyle Walker's family – was put on the market for £3.25m.\nPosts on TikTok and Instagram show several dozen people, believed to be family members, partying in the garden of the £1m country home\nThe sprawling four-bed modern home features its own gym, bar, hot tub and extensive gardens with a swing and a trampoline.\nThe detached home, which is down a private road with an electric security gate, also boasts a ground-floor leisure suite.\nOne of Foden's former neighbours said: 'They are a lovely family and Phil and Rebecca seem devoted parents.\n'I saw them take Ronnie out on a bike he'd been given for Christmas and they seemed just like a young family having fun.\n'He moved out a while ago now but has finally put in on the market.'\nA raucous late-night party at Foden's house in August last year, led to police being called.\nOne neighbour said it was 'louder than Glastonbury' with booming gangster rap music.\nRebecca and Ronnie celebrated with Foden after Manchester City beat Inter Milan at the UEFA Champions League in 2023\nThe couple with their firstborn Ronnie\nAnother dialled 999 over the blaring music after complaints it was so loud it was 'like being in a nightclub'.\nCheshire Police confirmed they were contacted over a noise complaint but officers did not go to the house.\nNeighbours said the kids party started around 4pm and went on until nearly midnight.\nSnoop Dog's 'Drop It Like It's Hot' and a Queen Latifah hit were heard being blasted from a PA system, as kids screamed and Foden's Doberman guard dog barked.\nIn March 2022 the England player also sparked noise complaints after having a Mother's Day 'music festival' at home, where he blasted out Whitney Houston hits.\nAt the time, it was claimed by neighbours that 'things got out of hand'.\nThe Premier League winner's next door neighbour for more than two years was his City team-mate Kyle Walker.\nHowever Walker was thrown out by his WAG Annie Kilner after it was revealed he had fathered a second child with his former mistress Lauryn Goodman.\nWalker now plays for AC Milan in Italy.\nFoden bought his parents a house just half a mile away in the same village but that is now also on the market.\nFoden and his family with the Premier League trophy on May 19, 2024\nHis mother has made the decision to move house just a week after she was on the receiving end of disgusting abuse from Manchester United fans.\nClaire Rowlands, 45, became the subject of appalling chants from Red Devils supporters during a recent drab 0-0 Manchester derby at Old Trafford.\nThe England midfielder was targeted by sections of the home support who abhorrently labelled his mum a 's**g' before his substitution in the 58th minute.\nFoden and Rebecca welcomed their first child Ronnie in 2019, followed by their daughter True in 2021.\nIn an interview with Manchester City, Foden spoke about being there for the birth of Ronnie, saying: 'I was there for the birth. I walked out of the room, gave it a little tear and then went back in like nothing happened'.\nHe briefly left the England camp during Euro 2024 in Germany, to fly home for the birth of his third child.\nFoden is the youngest player to win six league titles, helping Manchester City secure their fourth consecutive Premier League last season.\nThe lifelong City fan has also won the Champions League after his side beat Inter Milan 1-0 in 2023.",
