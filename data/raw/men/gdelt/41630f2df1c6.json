And bookies Betano are getting in on the action. New customers can back Aston Villa to beat Manchester United at 35/1 enhanced odds.\nAston Villa enters this match buoyed by recent successes on the European stage, having clinched a notable victory against Bayern Munich in the Champions League. Under the strategic management of Unai Emery, Villa has shown resilience and tactical acumen, making them a formidable side at home. Their recent domestic form, however, has been mixed, with a 2-2 draw against Ipswich highlighting areas for improvement. This match against Manchester United presents an opportunity for Villa to demonstrate their growth and ambition within the Premier League.\nMeanwhile, Manchester United comes into this fixture under significant pressure. After a disappointing 3-0 defeat to Tottenham, manager Erik ten Hag faces scrutiny over his tactics and team selections. The team's recent 3-3 draw against Porto in the Europa League further underscores their need for consistency and cohesion on the pitch. For United, this match is not just about securing three points but also about regaining confidence and stability in their campaign.\nHere is how you can claim your Betano offer:\nCan't see the widget above?
