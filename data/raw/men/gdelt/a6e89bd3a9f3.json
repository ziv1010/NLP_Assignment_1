Definitely.’\nCity simply could not cope with Madrid’s array of attacking talent and Shearer believes it must be a ‘dream’ for the likes of Jude Bellingham, Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and Mbappe with the amount of opportunities Ancelotti’s side create in matches.\n‘It must be a dream, a treat, for those guys with the amount of chances that they create and the amount of ability that they’ve got,’ he added.\n‘So Real Madrid are very, very strong and they are, without doubt, my favourites to win.’\nShearer continued: ‘The three or four of them are brilliant at rotation so if Vinicius Junior wants to come down the middle then Kylian will go out wide.\n‘They’re all equally as good wherever they are.\n‘Say what you want about the defending. The defending was blummin’ awful at times from Manchester City and you can’t give anyone the amount of space that they did.\n‘But to give it to him [Mbappe]… and the three goals were also so very, very different. Three great finishes but very different ones.’\nMore Trending\nParis Saint-Germain cruised past Brest to reach the round of 16, winning 10-0 on aggregate, and Shearer feels Luis Enrique’s side could be ‘dark horses’ for the trophy.\nAfter Gary Lineker picked out PSG as an outside bet for the title, Shearer replied: ‘I agree.\n‘Over two legs I think they will give anyone a good game. They’re more of a team now than they have been.\n‘Whether they’re good enough this season to go and win it, I’m not sure but they’ll be a real test for anyone left in the competition.’\nAre Real Madrid the Champions League favourites?\n-\nYes\n-\nNo\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: What time is the Champions League last-16 draw?
