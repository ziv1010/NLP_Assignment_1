Here are your latest Nottingham Forest headlines from NottinghamshireLive on Wednesday, March 8.\nNottingham Forest transfer twist as surprise €12m negotiations give summer window hope\nNottingham Forest have been handed a transfer boost in their pursuit of Brazilian wonderkid Angelo.\nThe Reds reportedly made a bid for the 18-year-old, which would have seen him move to the City Ground on loan until the end of the season. If Forest were to avoid relegation, he would then have made a permanent move for €19million.\nForest and Santos did not reach an agreement in January, with the teenager staying put at his current club. But it has now emerged that Santos are struggling financially and are negotiating the player's sale with fellow Brazilian top flight club Flamengo.\nNottingham Forest director makes future admission in Italy outburst\nNottingham Forest sporting director Filippo Giraldi has addressed the possibility of returning to Italy in a recent interview.\nThe 49-year-old became the Reds sporting director last October, shortly before head of recruitment George Syrianos and head of scouting Andy Scott were sacked by the club. He was previously Watford's technical director and also worked behind the scenes at Italian clubs AC Prato and Brescia Calcio.\nGiraldi says he is open to one day making a return to his native country to work in Serie A, but has given no indication that he will walk away from Forest in the near future. “It will happen sooner or later, but only under certain conditions. I hate the word ‘project’ but I don’t want improvisations either,” he told Tuttosport (via Football Italia ).\nAntonio Conte makes honest admission ahead of Premier League return vs Nottingham Forest\nTottenham Hotspur manager Antonio Conte has said that he is \"feeling good\" after returning to training following emergency surgery, but admitted he \"under evaluated\" the recovery that he would need.\nThe Spurs boss did return for two games following gallbladder surgery last month, but was advised to take more time off by his doctors. He has been watching from afar for the last four games in all competitions, but has since returned to action ahead of the weekend’s Premier League clash against Nottingham Forest.\nThe Reds travel to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday afternoon (3pm kick off) as they look to build on the 2-2 draw with Everton at the City Ground on Sunday. While Forest have a full week to prepare for the game, Spurs are in midweek Champions League action as they take on AC Milan in the second leg of their round of 16 tie.\nFormer Nottingham Forest star delivers theory on why Brazilian duo have been dropped\nFormer Nottingham Forest midfielder Lewis McGugan has backed Steve Cooper's decision to scale back Gustavo Scarpa and Danilo's involvement in the first team.\nScarpa, 29, has featured once in the last five games as he started in the 2-0 defeat to Fulham, while Danilo, 21, has played once in four when he started against Manchester City.\nBoth were not in the squad which drew 2-2 with Everton at the weekend, although Cooper has not yet confirmed if the pair were left out for injury, tactical or personal reasons.\nREAD NEXT:\n- Nottingham Forest to rival Tottenham for transfer as 'enquiries' made\n- Nottingham Forest forward handed major injury blow\n- Nottingham Forest told transfer stance as manager confirms high-level talks\n- Forest tipped to 'reach high in the future' as they build an identity\n- How Nottingham Forest's record defeat compares with Liverpool’s 7-0 thrashing of Man Utd",
