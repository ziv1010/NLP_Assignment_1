  "body_text": "Senegal and Morocco will meet on Sunday in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) final, the first time the teams have ever faced each other in the competition.\nMorocco have home advantage in Rabat but have not won the tournament since 1976. This is Senegal’s third final in four editions, winning in 2021 after finishing runners-up in 2019.\nJay Harris and Max Mathews, both in Morocco, analyse what we can expect from the final.\nAdvertisement\nDo we have the best two teams in the final?\nHarris: The infrastructure and consistent investment from the Senegalese and Moroccan football federations over an extended period of time mean it is not a huge surprise that both sides have reached the final.\nSenegal have performed at a high level over the past decade. They have qualified for three World Cups in a row and won AFCON 2021. This might be the last chance for veterans Edouard Mendy, Sadio Mane and Kalidou Koulibaly to lift this trophy again, so they will be desperate to make their mark.\nMorocco’s head coach Walid Regragui has evolved the squad since their famous run to the semi-finals of the last World Cup. Tricky wingers Hakim Ziyech and Sofiane Boufal have been replaced by an exciting new generation which includes Abde Ezzalzouli and Ismael Saibari. Morocco have not been perfect — it took them a while to break down Tanzania and Comoros — but they have never looked like losing.\nMathews: Teams tend to find their level in elite tournaments and it is rare that sides advance far beyond their capabilities.\nMorocco and Senegal deserve their place in the showpiece but Nigeria are unfortunate not to be there. Had this match been played on neutral territory, without the tilted field of home advantage, they may well have edged out Morocco in the semi-final.\nYou could say Ivory Coast and Cameroon were talented enough to make the semi-finals, South Africa, DR Congo or Burkina Faso the quarter-finals, or Gabon the knockouts…\nBut this tournament has gone mostly as expected, with few shocks or upsets. The finalists are the two strongest teams.\nWhat has impressed you most about both teams?\nHarris: Morocco’s squad has the perfect blend of youth and experience. Brahim Diaz has been the best player at this competition and Achraf Hakimi’s return from a nasty injury was expertly managed. They have exciting options from the bench, including Ilias Akhomach and Hamza Igamane, who can freshen things up if needed. There has been a huge amount of pressure on this team but they have not cracked.\nAdvertisement\nSenegal’s head coach Pape Thiaw has effortlessly built upon the solid foundations put in place by his predecessor Aliou Cisse. Senegal did not create many clear chances against Egypt in the semi-final but the way they completely nullified their opponents’ threat on the counter was impressive. They had 65 per cent possession and penned Egypt in their own box. Senegal kept probing until Mane popped up with a crucial strike.\nMathews: Senegal have a deep squad. Their youth football setup is strong and is feeding a pipeline of talented young players into the senior team.\nThey have also come through different kinds of matches: where the opposition has had a player sent off, where they have had a player sent off and breaking down low blocks.\nMorocco’s defence has been excellent, considering Adam Masina, who has spent a lot of time as a left-back, is covering at centre-back for the injured Romain Saiss.\nThey have conceded only once — a penalty for Mali in the group stage — in six matches, including one extra-time period.\nWill home advantage have a big impact?\nHarris: It is going to be huge. Morocco are unbeaten in their past 39 matches at home. The last time they lost was the defeat by Cameroon in November 2009.\nSenegal need to cope with the intimidating atmosphere much better than Nigeria. When Samuel Chukwueze, a 121st-minute substitute, stepped up to take a penalty in the semi-final, you could see in his eyes how taken aback he was by the overwhelming noise from the crowd.\nThere was never any sense of frustration from the fans during that game. They stuck with Morocco throughout extra time and did not appear to be nervous. If Senegal take the lead, expect supporters to respond by becoming even louder.\nTo make things even worse for Senegal, 11 out of the 14 previous host nations to have reached the final have gone on to win. The only hosts to lose an AFCON final in open play were Tunisia in 1965. Senegal must prepare for a long night.\nMathews: Very much so. The sheer scale and ubiquity of the din inside the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium for the semi-final was headache-inducing.\nAdvertisement\nAside from the inspiration it gives the Moroccan players, the constant whistling, booing and chanting put opposition players under severe pressure in a highly uncomfortable environment.\nNot to mention what it does to the referees, who have made some bizarre ‘home’ calls, especially against Cameroon in the quarter-final.\nSpeaking after Nigeria’s semi-final loss, Bright Osayi-Samuel explained that the refereeing was not the reason his side had lost, but said: “The refereeing was appalling. It’s really painful to see refs like that in a game like today.”\nRegragui has hit back on several occasions when asked about comments on his side receiving favourable refereeing.\nWhere will this game be won and lost?\nHarris: Morocco have incredible attacking options but they are stubborn defensively. They have only conceded once this tournament — that penalty from Mali’s Lassine Sinayoko in the group stage.\nWith 14 goals, Nigeria are the top scorers but they only recorded two shots and 11 touches in the box in their semi-final defeat by Morocco. Senegal need to find a way to break their opponents down to have any chance of winning. Otherwise, they will be suffocated by the host nation.\nMathews: Good question!\nWhether Morocco’s tricky wingers Brahim and Ezzalzouli pin back Senegal full-backs El Hadji Malick Diouf and Krepin Diatta as successfully as they did Nigeria’s flyers will dictate how isolated Senegal’s wider forwards are.\nSpeaking of which, Iliman Ndiaye will be keen to probe that channel between Noussair Mazraoui and Adam Masina with Diatta’s help, and it will be interesting to see how the attack-minded Hakimi deals with the cunning and sometimes unorthodox positioning of Mane. Neil El Aynaoui could be pulled out of position to cover.\nFinally, I am really looking forward to seeing how Lamine Camara — if he replaces the suspended Habib Diarra — interacts with his likely opposite man Saibari, and how their orbits intertwine in midfield.\nAdvertisement\nWhich under-the-radar player should I watch out for?\nHarris: Masina was thrust into Morocco’s starting XI after veteran centre-back Saiss suffered an injury in their opening game. Masina was fortunate not to concede a penalty in the 2-0 victory over Cameroon, and possibly a red card for clattering Karl Etta Eyong, but he performed much better against Nigeria’s Victor Osimhen. It will be interesting to see how the 32-year-old handles Senegal’s vibrant and unpredictable attacking options.\nMathews: Senegal’s Mamadou Sarr, the 20-year-old, could start at centre-half and has big boots to fill in the totemic figure of 34-year-old captain Koulibaly, who is suspended.\nAs a likely bench option, 17-year-old Ibrahim Mbaye of Champions League holders Paris Saint-Germain has positively impacted several matches here in Morocco.\nFor the hosts, I like Jay’s Masina shout, plus vibrant striker Igamane of Lille, who could come on to replace probable starter Ayoub El Kaabi.\nIf Regragui’s substitutions are bold, Eliesse Ben Seghir and Chemsdine Talbi, both 20, are technically gifted attacking midfielders who could steal the show.\nWho do you see as favourites and why?\nHarris: Morocco. Backed by home advantage with a tight defence and balanced attack, it is hard to see them losing. For a long time it has felt like they are destined to win this tournament.\nMathews: Anywhere else in the world and it’s a toss-up. Senegal’s midfield edges Morocco’s; Morocco’s defence is tighter than Senegal’s.\nIt is hard to look beyond the hosts as favourites given the fierce home support, but Senegal are battle-hardened after reaching three of the previous four AFCON finals since 2019.\nMorocco have only reached two in their history until now — one in 1976 (they won), and one on Valentine’s Day 2004 (they lost). Regragui played in that 2004 match, when five of his current squad were yet to be born.\nMorocco are favourites, but I’ll go against the seemingly unstoppable tide of inevitability and say Senegal will win.",
