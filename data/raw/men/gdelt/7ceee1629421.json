  "body_text": "Real Madrid 2-0 Atalanta (Valverde & Mbappé). Another trophy in the cabinet. Here is my reaction to the first match of the season. More celebrations on the way: Player ratings, post game quotes and the podcast.\nEuropean SuperCup Immediate Reaction: Real Madrid 2-0 Atalanta\nA first Real Madrid trophy for Kylian Mbappé…\nFans would have to wait no more to see Kylian Mbappé walk onto the field of play in a Real Madrid kit, with the Frenchman getting to opportunity to lift some silverware from the get go on his debut. Europa League winners Atalanta formed a SuperCup final with Real, after their Champions League triumph last season. Kylian started as the number nine, in a front three with both Rodrygo Goes and Vinícius Júnior. Jude Bellingham sat in the midfield with the new number eight Fede Valverde. Despite finishing training early with an injury, Eduardo Camavinga made the bench tonight. Dani Carvajal captained the team tonight.\nThe first fifteen minutes consisted of pure entertainment, mixed with relief that the Kylian Mbappé transfer saga was over, and he was finally ours. Some nice touches and link-ups with his new teammates was good to see - but Atalanta quickly grew in confidence at the other end. They had the first two real chances, with a deflected cross bouncing off of the crossbar, and a long ranged effort flying wide. Aurélien Tchouaméni had a funny first half, getting in the way of Thibaut Courtois twice, and almost making his side pay with a sloppy sideways pass on the half-way line. Rodrygo Goes almost sent Madrid into half time perfectly, with his surprise effort hitting the bar after a great pass from Vinícius Júnior to find him. Half time, 0-0.\nCourtois was needed early on in the second half with a world class save to tip a headed effort away. Atalanta then attacked again with a wide shot missing the target. The Italians were having a decent spell, before Madrid inevitably pushed back. Vinícius sped past a defender before setting up Fede Valverde to score his first goal with the number eight on his back, and Madrid’s first goal of the season. The Brazilian then should have scored himself immediately from kick-off after being sent through, but his shot was saved. Jude Bellingham then joined the party with an effort of his own well saved. Jude would then turn the provider in a huge moment, as his lay-off allowed Kylian Mbappé to spike the ball into the top of the net to score his first goal as a Real Madrid player. 2-0, and cruising towards another trophy. Luka Modrić came on to receive the captains armband and lift the trophy, as the game finished 2-0 to Real Madrid. What did you think about this one?",
