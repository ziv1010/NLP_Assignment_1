City dominated the first half but were unable to add to their advantage.\nPep Guardiola's men would rue their wastefulness as Josko Gvardiol levelled the score for the hosts in the 70th minute, rising highest to head the ball home as Ederson was caught in no man's land.\nThings are all level as this matchup heads to England for the second leg on March 14.\n(Photo: Getty Images)\nThanks for following along!\nThat's all for this blog, but be sure to come back tomorrow for our live coverage of a massive Europa League second leg between Manchester United and Barcelona at Old Trafford!\nRose: 'Better late than never'\nMarco Rose told BT Sport what he said to his players at half-time: \"We should start to play and fight. It was a really difficult first half, 26 per cent possession isn't enough.\n\"We were too passive in every situation. They moved the ball and they moved us. We had no power.\n\"The second half was totally different. Better late than never.\"\nPost-match reaction from Leipzig players\nBenjamin Henrichs: \"When we play like we did in the second half, you can see that we can compete with Man City. During the break, the head coach told us to stay calm.\n\"We got (Szoboszlai) into the game more after that, which helped us become more dangerous.\"\nXaver Schlager: \"The first half wasn't good, but the second half was. We needed to be calmer on the ball and that was the difference in the second half.\n\"Our passes were finding the mark and that put them under a bit more pressure and then they make the mistake.\"\nPep tells players to keep heads up\nPep Guardiola on huddling with his players on the pitch after the match: \"They were heads down. I said, 'Why are you heads down? Be heads up. It was really good the way you play. If people don't like it it doesn't matter.'\"\n(Photo: Getty Images)\nLeipzig are no pushovers\nEverybody I spoke to before the game was very wary of RB Leipzig and expected a tough game, so it's no surprise that they actually caused problems for Manchester City.\nBut the swing in performance between halves is alarming for City. Given Leipzig are dangerous, I'm more concerned about City's attacks breaking down.\nPep defends City's performance\nAfter the match, Pep Guardiola pushed back on any criticism of his side's performance in the second half:\nAround the Champions League\nIn today's other Champions League match, Inter Milan beat 10-man Porto 1-0 in Italy thanks to a goal in the 86th minute from second-half substitute Romelu Lukaku.\nPorto were reduced to 10 men when Otavio was sent off in the 78th minute for a second yellow card.\nItalian sides took a perfect three wins from three matches in their first legs, Inter joining AC Milan and Napoli in victory.\n(Photo: Getty Images)\nA game of two halves\nThis graphic from Opta does a great job of illustrating just how little Leipzig offered in attack during the first half:\nHow rare is no subs?\nManchester City have become the first team to make no subs in a Champions League game since Manchester United did so in a group stage match in October 2018 against Juventus.\nGerman sides can't beat City\nManchester City continue their strong run of form against German sides in the Champions League.\nThe club have now lost just one of their past 18 such matches, alongside 14 wins and three draws.\nLeipzig end knockout goal drought\nJosko Gvardiol's equaliser ended a three-game goal drought for Leipzig in Champions League knockout matches.\nTheir previous three knockout matches in the tournament were a pair of 2-0 defeats to Liverpool in this round in 2021, and a 3-0 loss to Paris Saint-Germain in the 2020 semi-final.\nEnglish teams not looking so Premier\nThe Premier League's four representatives in the last 16 of the Champions League failed to win any of their first-leg matches:\nCity made no subs\nSo strange that Pep didn’t make any subs. City looked so flat in the second half.\nSet for competitive second leg\nWhat a strange game of football!\nThe Manchester City fans who headed to Germany (and many others at home, for that matter) expected a very tough game here in Leipzig. In the end that proved to be the case.\nCity were immaculate in the first half but often struggled to cope with Leipzig's re-found vigour after the break. The draw is a fair reflection of how the two halves went, although Leipzig will probably think they had a couple more clear-cut opportunities that they could have taken.\nThe second leg is set up very nicely.\nFT: RB Leipzig 1-1 Manchester City\nCity shout for a handball against Leipzig in the closing seconds, but nothing doing as the whistle blows.\nTruly a game of two halves.\nCity thoroughly dominated the first half and perhaps should have scored more than once.\nBut things completely flipped in the second half. Leipzig didn't dominate like City had, but they deserved their equaliser.\nStoppage time\n90+1' RB Leipzig 1-1 Manchester City\nTwo minutes are added on here.\nHenrichs is booked after clattering into Gundogan.\nLeipzig make final change\n89' RB Leipzig 1-1 Manchester City\nRaum comes on for Halstenberg.\nLeipzig have made all five of their subs, while City are still yet to make a single change!\nCity pressing for winner\n87' RB Leipzig 1-1 Manchester City\nCity have retaken control of the match a bit, dominating possession like they did in the first half.\nHowever, other than Blaswich's save on Gundogan's chance, they've yet to really threaten the visitors' goal much this half.\nDouble change for Leipzig\n82' RB Leipzig 1-1 Manchester City\nHaidara and Poulsen replace Schlager and Silva.\nLeipzig have just one sub remaining, while City have yet to make a single change.\nTeam Stats\nRBL\nMCI\nGame Details",
