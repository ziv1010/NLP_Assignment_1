  "body_text": "Who can win in the Champions League?\nBy Joseph Barnett\nAfter three compelling rounds of Champions League Football, the time feels right to survey which teams look capable of going deep into the competition.\nParis St-Germain, the defending champions, sit at the top of the table. They have scored the most goals in the competition, putting seven goals past Bayer Leverkusen last time out. Great teams win trophies, but the greatest teams change the way football is played and Enrique’s PSG certainly fit into this category. In a movement away from Tika Taka football, their style of play combines direct, counter attacking play spearheaded by Ousmane Dembele, with midfield technical excellence orchestrated by Vitinha and Fabian Ruiz. One can see how a more direct style of play is being used to great effect by teams like Bournemouth in the Premier League. For years, the Parisian side were expensive failures in Europe. A team that always crumbled under pressure. However, in a post Mbappe era, PSG have stumbled on a winning formula, and no one would be surprised if the French team made it two in a row.\nPSG’s upcoming game against the Bayern Munich will tell us more about both sides – Bayern are second in the league table, unbeaten, and have an incredibly exciting attack fronted by Harry Kane who is the competitions top scorer so far. The ‘favourites’ tag will be warranted for the winner of this game.\nOutside of the French and German champions, the biggest challenge will come from the Premier League, with Arsenal the most likely contenders. Their centre back pairing of Gabriel and William Saliba is probably the most formidable in the World as demonstrated by how Arsenal have only conceded three goals in the Premier League this season (meaning they are on track to break Chelsea’s 20-year-old league record). Added to this, they have signed talented attackers Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke, making them less reliant on the fitness of Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard. We have already seen the benefits of this abundance of riches with Gabriel Martinelli and Leondro Trossard coming off the bench to score late goals in 2-0 win against Athletic Bilbao. All the ingredients to win the Champions League are present but can Arsenal deliver in the moments of maximum pressure later in the competition.\nManchester City could also pose a challenge. They are a team in transition; but they do possess the world’s most destructive striker and accomplished manager. Erling Haaland has scored City’s first goal in every Champions League game so far, reflecting his talismanic status and treble winning players such as Phil Foden are also starting to show a return to form. Questions remain about whether this City team will reach the heights of 2022, but what cannot be doubted is Guardiola’s commitment to prove people wrong and win Europe’s biggest prize once again.\nDespite a string of defeats, Liverpool are also worthy of consideration. In some ways, the early season slump may enhance Liverpool’s chances. After Christmas, they may decide to prioritise Europe giving them an advantage over teams that will be fighting on multiple fronts. By the time the knockout stages start, Liverpool may have also integrated their new signings and rediscovered their usual defensive solidity. If they can get these things right, Liverpool’s late first-half performance against Eintracht Frankfurt illustrates their destructive potential.\nThe Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid are perennial Champions League winners, and such is the history of the respective clubs that both sets of supporters will expect another European Cup victory. Barcelona may no longer splash out on big signings, yet their academy La Masia makes up for this, producing superstars such as Lamine Yamal and Pedri. Add into the mix, the resurgent Marcus Rashford and the tactical nous of Hansi Flick (2020 Champions League winner) and Barcelona will surely hope to at least match last year’s run to the Semi Final. Much like America is the ‘one indispensable nation in world affairs’, Real Madrid are the dominant force in Champions League history. They are not the most cohesive team – more a collection of individuals – however Real Madrid play incredibly well under pressure as shown by their latest El Classico win, making them extremely hard to beat over two legs, especially if they play the concluding leg at the Bernabeu. The paragraphs above feature a selection of the standout teams; however, the Champions League can produce an unexpected winner. No one would have predicted an ageing Chelsea side winning the 2012 Champions League. Teams like Newcastle, Dortmund or Simeone’s Atletico Madrid all could go far in the competition. In fact, after four rounds in last season’s competition PSG were in 25th place and went onto win the competition. Supporters throughout the land should feel hope: if you make the knockout stages anything is possible.\nImage Credit: LauraHale via Wikimedia Commons.",
