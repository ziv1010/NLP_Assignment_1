  "body_text": "The January transfer window is open which means clubs across Europe are busy trying to maintain or rescue their season with a transformative signing or two.\nBig-money arrivals make all the headlines but there’s a satisfaction that comes from the sort of clever analysis and scouting which unearths emerging talent before they join the A-list, whether that’s this month or at some point in the future.\nAdvertisement\nHere, our writers pick out 10 of the most impressive under-the-radar performers of the 2023-24 season so far…\nSamuel Omorodion, Deportivo Alaves (on loan from Atletico Madrid)\nSamuel Omorodion — or “Samu” — may not have been on your list this season.\nA modest five goals in La Liga is unlikely to impress you, but there is excitement swirling around the potential of the 19-year-old. After Atletico Madrid signed him from Granada this summer, Sami was instantly loaned to Deportivo Alaves until the end of the season — and he has shown he is ready to mix it with the big boys.\nStanding at 6ft 4in (193cm), Samu’s pace and strength are more reflective of a seasoned, peak-age striker than a teenager in his maiden season in Spain’s top division — much in the same way that a young Romelu Lukaku was roughing up defences for Anderlecht and West Bromwich Albion before celebrating his 20th birthday.\nHe is not an all-action No 9, with just 14.1 passes per 90 among the bottom 10 per cent of forwards in La Liga this season. Nor is he the most clinical finisher across Europe. However, Samu’s tendency to arrive in lucrative areas to score ensures his shots are predominantly between the width of the six-yard box.\nOnly a handful of La Liga players can boast a stronger average shot quality than Omorodion this season, with his 0.21 xG per shot highlighting that the efforts he takes have a good chance of resulting in a goal.\nOne example of this was Samu’s goal against Barcelona — incidentally, the fastest goal conceded by Barcelona in a home league match in the 21st century.\nAs shown below, Samu begins his run on the blind side of Barcelona’s defence. As the ball reaches Alaves’s Javi Lopez, Samu is onside but crucially goalside of Barcelona’s centre-backs to arrive at the six-yard box for a simple one-touch finish.\nBorn to Nigerian parents, Samu does have the option to add to Nigeria’s golden generation of forwards but has shown allegiance to his native Spain — receiving a call-up to the under-19 and under-21 Spanish national team.\nAdvertisement\n“Spain has given me the opportunity and I am very grateful for it,” Samu said earlier this season. “I don’t think about Nigeria. My goal is to debut with the senior side and have my career in Spain.”\nAs far as domestic football goes, the teenager might not be on the move this January — but should Atleti wish to grant Samu another loan in the summer, there should be plenty of clubs keeping an eye on his performances in the second half of the season.\nMark Carey\nMatias Soule, Frosinone (on loan from Juventus)\nNo player in Europe’s top five leagues — not Leroy Sane or Nico Williams, not Khvicha Kvaratskhelia or Jeremy Doku, not even Kylian Mbappe — has dribbled past more opponents this season than the 20-year-old Argentine right-winger and attacking midfielder Matias Soule, who skips past some poor schlub four times a game.\nBy comparison, Juventus, the club that sent Soule out on loan to Frosinone this season, complete seven take-ons per match as an entire team. Please picture some very specific Italian hand gesture emphasising how ridiculous these numbers are.\nIf torching dudes was all Soule did all day, he would already be in demand. A lot of top clubs are relying on dribbly wingers to tear down low blocks one-v-one — think of a Champions League contender and you probably already know who their go-to wide guy is. But that’s just a fraction of Soule’s surprisingly well-rounded game.\nSome more statistiche al dente to chew on: at the time of writing, Soule is eighth in Serie A for progressive passes per FBref’s definition, between the likes of Manuel Locatelli and Hakan Calhanoglu, and 13th for progressive passes received, one slot above Inter’s speedster Marcus Thuram — a rare combination of on-ball creator and off-ball runner. He’s seventh for expected assists and perched atop the entire league for shot-creating actions. Oh yeah, he’s also scored eight goals. When you realise that he’s doing all this for an attack that’s barely above relegation tier, you’d be forgiven for drooling a little.\nYet even that sells Soule short. Unlike your usual highlight-reel faves, he’s also an all-gas-no-brakes defender who pays scrupulous attention to positioning and pressing angles. His body language can get a little sulky when team-mates don’t match his defensive energy, but can you really blame the kid? He’s pouring his heart out every minute he’s on the pitch.\nAdvertisement\nAdd it all up and you get a player who contributes more value at his role, according to Mike Imburgio’s expected goals added model, than any 20-year-old not named Jude Bellingham or Florian Wirtz. That kind of company makes it tough to believe reports that Juve are willing to shop him around, but no matter where he lands next, you’ll be hearing a lot more about Soule soon.\nJohn Muller\nJean-Clair Todibo, Nice\nOK, so not exactly under the radar considering links with Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur in recent weeks — but it wouldn’t be a transfer window without a talented Ligue 1 centre-back making a move to a top-five European league, would it?\nThat pathway is more than trodden, and exactly why Ligue 1’s branding of Le Ligue des Talents is more self-aware than self-indulgent: Benoit Badiashile, William Saliba, Axel Disasi, Nayef Aguerd, Sven Botman, Wout Faes, Loic Bade, Mohamed Simakan, Gabriel, Wesley Fofana and Jules Kounde have all cut their teeth in France’s top tier since 2019 before moving on. Nice’s Jean-Clair Todibo should be the next name on that list.\nTodibo joined Barcelona from Toulouse in 2019, but had three loans to Schalke, Benfica, then Nice in February 2021, before joining permanently that summer. He played 70 of 78 league games across 2021-22 and 2022-23, as Nice finished fifth and then ninth.\nTodibo and Dante have been the bedrock of Nice’s excellent start to 2023-24 under Francesco Farioli. The headline is they went unbeaten in their first 13 games, kept 10 clean sheets and only conceded four, without going behind at any point. Dante has called his partner “well-rounded”, adding that “he has found real balance in his game between taking risks, dribbling out from the back because it’s the best thing to do and having fun on the pitch.”\nGO DEEPER\nThe cautious contenders: How Nice became the most effective team in Ligue 1\nNice’s high pressing means Todibo is regularly asked to mark a No 9 tightly, having to use his athleticism and defensive nous in wide one-v-one duels, or control and restraint to follow a striker into their own half. His ability to eat up ground and backwards defend — running towards his own goal — is similar to Saliba.\nAdvertisement\nHe shines in possession, ranking inside the top 10 per cent of top-five league centre-backs this season for passes, successful take-ons and tackles, and the top 20 per cent for progressive passes and interceptions.\nTodibo is ripe for a high-possession, build-up-heavy team, as Nice regularly build short from the back, with the under-pressure centre-backs tasked with finding passes into central midfielders or playing long to the front three to break the press. He made 188 touches in Nice’s 1-0 away win over Metz this season, the most by Opta on record (since 2006-07), and one of six occasions in which Todibo has made 100+ touches in a game this season.\nFarioli joked in the summer that rumours about Todibo’s departure were so strong that Nice “developed antibodies against them”. “He’s a quality player, he would be very hard to replace. I hope the rumours stay rumours,” he added.\nHistory tells us they do not stay rumours — though it will take a sizeable fee for Nice to part with a player they have contracted for another three years.\nLiam Tharme\nJan-Niklas Beste, Heidenheim\nJan-Niklas Beste has just experienced six months that most assumed he never would.\nIn May 2023, the 25-year-old winger was part of Heidenheim’s miracle promotion. In that now famous 11 minutes of stoppage times played in Regensburg, he scored one of the goals they needed from the penalty spot and then provided the cross for Tim Kleindienst to finish the other.\nThat took Heidenheim and head coach Frank Schmidt to the Bundesliga in which, despite their tiny budget, they have again punched above their weight and sit ninth in the table. Beste grew up in the Borussia Dortmund academy and then spent four years at Werder Bremen without having so much as a kick in their first team. Finally, he is now a top-flight player.\nAdvertisement\nBeste’s role since Heidenheim’s promotion has been two-fold. A slight, but physically intense player (ranked 11th for the most sprints in the Bundesliga), he has proven to be the ideal component within Schmidt’s quick-breaking side. On average, FCH progress the ball up the field at 2.23m/second, making them comfortably the most vertical team in the Bundesliga, and he is often their most dangerous player when they pour forward.\nHe has end product. He has scored against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena and against Augsburg. Against Werder Bremen in a 4-2 win, too, which he must have enjoyed. He is predominantly left-footed but can finish with both feet, and he provides a steady beat of crosses into the box from open play.\nBut from set pieces, Beste is among the most gifted players in Germany. Heidenheim have scored 10 goals from dead balls so far this season. His whipped free kicks against Union Berlin and Hoffenheim account for two of them — look those up — and FCH have scored five more directly from his corners and free kicks. Part of that is good design because Schmidt and his coaching staff know that it is an area in which their team needs to excel to survive, but that scheming would not be nearly as profitable without Beste’s delivery.\nHe is a component. Not a superstar or a player upon whom a club’s fortunes can change, but a highly coachable, whole-hearted footballer who has more quality than many realise and who keeps adapting to new levels of the game.\nSebastian Stafford-Bloor\nMiguel Gutierrez, Girona\nNot only do Girona keep on winning in La Liga this season, they keep on evolving.\nSitting top of the table with Real Madrid on 48 points — seven clear of Barcelona and 10 of Atletico Madrid — their astonishing start to the season has been built on fluid possession football and constant shapeshifting, players launching themselves into dangerous situations to pull their opponents out of shape.\nAdvertisement\nFew have been as fearless in that regard as Miguel Gutierrez, a player seemingly able to squirm out of any situation. Unfazed by opposition pressure, even the spectator can feel uncomfortable watching the 22-year-old receive the passes he demands from his team-mates, but Miguel is two-footed and light on his feet, head swivelling as he jumps from pocket to pocket, always looking to help his team move up the pitch.\nLike most modern full-backs, Miguel inverts into midfield to receive passes from his centre-backs, as the below graphic illustrates against Getafe. But Miguel can do so much more. A strong ball-carrier, he can take on opposition structures with the ball at his feet. He can attack the flanks; see the Osasuna game, in which he covered over 300metres with his surges down the line.\nBut he can also, as his latest performances have proven, pick his moments to attack the penalty area with purpose, quadrupling his touches in the penalty area for the season in his last seven games alone, taking nine shots and scoring once along the way.\nWith such a versatile skill set, Miguel helps to keep Girona fresh. Despite his young age, he has proven a reliable wildcard; an adventurous player who understands which spaces to attack.\nIt is easy to understand why top Premier League clubs are on high alert, although Real Madrid, having kept 50 per cent of his rights after his 2022 move to Girona, have first refusal on any potential move.\nFootball increasingly hinges on mini passing battles in perilous parts of the pitch. With a player such as Miguel floating around, those battles become a lot easier to win.\nThom Harris\nAntonio Nusa, Club Bruges\nIt can be a risky game to build up a teenage talent.\nFor some players, the hype is justified. For others, it adds an undue weight that can be overbearing at such a tender age.\nAdvertisement\nClub Bruges’s Antonio Nusa appears to be thriving under the praise being showered upon him. The 18-year-old has already clocked up over 1,000 minutes in the Belgian Pro League, scored in the Champions League, and earned a handful of international caps for his native Norway.\nGO DEEPER\nEuroWatch: Antonio Nusa - the teen compared to Neymar and Haaland who deserves the hype\nWhen watching Nusa, you can understand why. His strength is running with the ball at his feet, with no attacking midfielder or winger in Belgium’s top division averaging higher than Nusa’s 10.3 attempted take-ons per 90 this season.\nHis frame might look as though a strong easterly breeze could knock him over, but there is a wiry toughness to the teenager. His “get-off-me” energy allows him to regularly shrug off opposition defenders who dare try to stop him in his tracks — with a drop of the shoulder that can unbalance even the most experienced full-backs.\nWhile capable of playing on the right flank, Nusa is most effective on the left side, able to twist, turn, and — crucially — come in on his stronger right foot to shoot or create for others. In a recent game for his country, Nusa’s run into the channel looks to have little threat as two Cypriot players converge towards him — but a sharp turn and a cheeky nutmeg allow him to wriggle out of the cul-de-sac to get a shot away from a tight angle. It is an exemplar of the Norwegian’s style.\nAlongside some injury niggles, Nusa’s minutes are — rightfully — being managed by his club with just six league starts in 2023-24, but his potential is rapidly growing.\nWith the Belgian Pro League being a hotbed for young talent, the obvious next question is whether Nusa can show similar promise within a stronger league. The teenager confirmed that Chelsea tried to sign him at the end of the summer transfer window, and interest from other clubs continues to be rife.\nIn truth, the most sensible option would be to continue his development in Belgium for a little longer, but the temptation of snapping up such an exciting attacking talent might prove too great for some of Europe’s elite sides this January.\nMark Carey\nAdvertisement\nMika Marmol, Las Palmas\nWatch the 22-year-old defender Mika Marmol play for Las Palmas for any length of time and you’ll come away with a new appreciation for how much of a centre-back’s job is about taking tiny little steps.\nWaiting for a pass, he’s always adjusting: backwards and sideways to open wide angles and dare would-be pressers to close long distances, or forward into a vanishing gap to receive in stride and dribble at the defence. On the ball, he takes arrhythmic, almost invisible steps that keep opponents guessing about where his next pass will go — often somewhere short but unexpected, almost always with a weight and placement that tell his team-mate where to play next.\nThen there are the little steps he takes in defence, snaking a leg around an opponent to cut out a pass or lunging to win a tackle without seeming to make any contact at all. He tracks runs in behind almost before they happen but knows when to let them go and turn back to the play. He’s aggressive in pursuit of dropping forwards but rarely caught out. His most important steps are the ones at just the right moment to catch an opponent offside, which Las Palmas do more than all but one team in Europe’s top five leagues.\nNot all of that work shows up in stats, but it builds a degree of trust that’s rare for a young defender. Last season, playing for FC Andorra in the Spanish Segunda, he completed 3,105 passes — an unthinkable 42 per cent more than any other player in the league in at least five seasons. Since joining Las Palmas, he’s been an every-game starter for former Barcelona B coach Garcia Pimienta, who has known Marmol since his youth career at La Masia.\nHow does a smart, elegant, Barcelona-trained centre-back suddenly burst onto the scene at 22? He’s got here by small steps, but he plays a style that top clubs demand — assured in the build-up, comfortable in a high line — and already looks prepared to take the next big step up.\nJohn Muller\nVangelis Pavlidis, AZ Alkmaar\nThere tends to be natural scepticism about recruiting from the Eredivisie, but with goalscoring No 9s back in fashion, AZ Alkmaar’s Vangelis Pavlidis is a worthwhile risk this window.\nAdvertisement\nThe 25-year-old is in his third season at AZ, recording 25+ goals plus assists in the previous two seasons in all competitions, with goal tallies of 20 and 17, as an ankle injury limited his minutes at the start of last season. This campaign, he has already hit 18 league goals (no penalties), joint-top with Feyenoord’s Santiago Gimenez, and over half of AZ’s total goals (35). Including his three UEFA Conference League goals, he has already had his best scoring season (21) at senior level.\n26 – Vangelis Pavlidis is the second @AZAlkmaar player in club history to score 26 @eredivisie goals in a single calendar year, after Kees Kist (31 in 1977, 29 in 1978). Olympian. pic.twitter.com/xi6stkXwG4\n— OptaJohan (@OptaJohan) December 9, 2023\nHis biggest strength is being varied; Pavlidis has all the raw materials of a top striker. He can drop off or pull wide, finish crosses one-touch, link play, press the back line and run in behind to attack through balls. He has as many right-footed shots as left-footed shots (26 each) in the league this season and is particularly excellent at taking angled shots across the goalkeeper from the half-spaces — watch his two carbon-copy left-footed goals on the angle away to Vitesse this season.\nThat variety makes him effective against different opponents; he scored in 10 consecutive Eredivisie games earlier this season, the first person to do so since Wilfried Bony a decade ago. Only once in the league this season — AZ’s 4-0 loss away to PSV Eindhoven — has he failed to register a shot.\nAZ’s ball-dominant style means they face a lot of deep defences, where Pavlidis will roam and show quick footwork to receive, turn, shift the ball out of his feet and shoot. He helped AZ to the Conference League semi-finals last season, netting twice in the second leg to overturn a 2-0 first-leg deficit against Anderlecht in the quarter-finals.\nEven better were his goals in the home and away legs against Lazio in the round of 16 — both goals were assisted from the left but very different finishes. In the away leg, a near-post dart and right-footed flick from a cutback, following a high turnover. At home, in an organised attack, he held his run on the edge of the box, received a low cross, opened his body and drilled a bottom-corner finish.\n🔴 Perfectly placed from Pavlidis ⚽️#UECL pic.twitter.com/6iJWxay67n\n— UEFA Europa Conference League (@europacnfleague) September 21, 2023\nThe caveat: his finishing is running pretty hot, on 22 goals from 13.8xG, and while he has been in the green in the past three seasons, buying players at their best form can be risky.\nThat said, his underlying numbers are still good — second for total non-penalty xG and top 10 for xG per shot — and his consistent European performances prove he can make the jump.\nLiam Tharme\nAdvertisement\nJonas Wind, Wolfsburg\nWolfsburg do not attract big crowds. Currently, Wolfsburg are not all that good, either.\nThe first part explains why, to an extent, Jonas Wind’s goalscoring went unnoticed early in the season. By the end of September, Wind had scored seven times in six Bundesliga games. However, the second issue — the quality of the team around him and their deteriorating form — describes why Wind’s ratio has since dropped to nine in 16.\nHis shots per 90 sit beneath 2.5, comparing unfavourably with every player above him in the goalscoring charts. Serhou Guirassy, Harry Kane, Deniz Undav and Lois Openda are all averaging between 3.5 and 4.6, while Bayer Leverkusen’s Victor Boniface is closer to 5.0.\nSo, there is a supply problem. Or, at least, trouble with how VfL are functioning as a side and Niko Kovac is not the most secure coach in the Bundesliga. But there is also an issue of image in that Wind does not score pretty goals. Rebounds, tap-ins, headers that just creep over the line; that is more his game. Physically, he is quite bullish and bustling, too, so the impression can be of a clumsy or unrefined forward and that, inevitably, affects perceptions of his worth.\nLook beyond that, though. Wind’s goalscoring speaks to the different ways in which he can score goals — and that he is also a fine penalty taker — and the quality of his anticipatory movement, too.\nHe might actually do some of his best work away from goal. Again, because he does not look like the creative, artisanal type, it is easy to miss just how much influence he can have on possession phases around the box. A one-two, a knock-down, a dummy run — little contributions that are not always present in the data but are key functions of how a team attacks.\nPut him in a better side, perhaps one who enjoy more control and possession (VfL have an average possession of 48 per cent this season) and, most likely, all Wind’s virtues should multiply.\nSebastian Stafford-Bloor\nAdvertisement\nRayan Cherki, Lyon\nNow, I know we said “under the radar” and Rayan Cherki’s abilities are hardly unknown — but such has been the catastrophe in Lyon this season, both on and off the pitch, that keeping one of Europe’s most effortlessly talented players is no longer the priority. The club need cash, and his expiring contract is a growing cause for concern.\nStill just 20, Cherki plays with audacity and freedom that has largely been drilled out of the modern game. He is a maverick, blessed with an innate ability to control a football, who operates with a perennial smirk on his face. Extremely two-footed, he can strike through the ball or cushion a perfect pass on either side, also able to rip through the gears to burst past opposition defenders at will.\nAn elegant dribbler bursting with flicks and tricks and a creative front-footed passer, there are few more complete attacking players in the world when Cherki is in the mood.\nCherki calling 🇫🇷💫 pic.twitter.com/fdUhfl9yb5\n— Ligue 1 English (@Ligue1_ENG) July 12, 2023\nFinding his rhythm consistently has not always been easy, and Cherki has been moved across a struggling team this season, operating on both flanks and through the middle in an all-action No 10 role.\nDespite his interrupted game time, however, no Lyon player has taken more touches in the attacking third this season, also completing the most take-ons and carries into the penalty area. Only Alexandre Lacazette has taken more shots, and only Maxence Caqueret has created more chances.\nEven when things are not quite clicking, Cherki is invariably fizzing away. There are aspects of his game that need to be improved — namely his commitment to his out-of-possession responsibilities, which can sometimes be forgotten between roving runs and skilling sprees.\nBut the talent can hardly be more obvious, and the opportunity to test Lyon’s resolve this January will be incredibly tempting for just about every top team on the continent.\nThom Harris\n(Top photos via Getty Images)",
