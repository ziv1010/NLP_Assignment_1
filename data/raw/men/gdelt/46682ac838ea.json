Rice succeeded Mark Noble as Hammers captain over the summer and is among Gareth Southgate’s most trusted generals with England.\nDuring the Qatar World Cup, Rice once again reiterated his desire to play Champions League football. Try as they might, that’s not a demand West Ham are likely to satisfy any time soon.\nRice has previously rejected three contract extensions put forward by West Ham. The latest would’ve seen the midfielder sign an eight-year deal worth £200,000-a-week.\nHis contract doesn’t expire until 2024 and there’s also a club option for an extra 12 months. However, the Athletic previously reported the Hammers are internally resigned to the fact Rice must go at season’s end if they’ve to extract maximum value.\nArsenal are believed to be the frontrunners for his signature at present. The fact they bid heavily for Moises Csicedo in January proves they had money to spend. Italy veteran Jorginho ultimately arrived, though only for £12m and he’s already the wrong side of 30.\nMan City and Chelsea are expected to make Arsenal’s life difficult over the move. However, according to Football Insider, all three could be usurped by Man Utd.\nThey report Erik ten Hag’s side ‘hope to blow Arsenal out of the water’ and are ‘hopeful’ of convincing him to join the Dutchman’s revolution.\nTheir remarkable turnaround under Ten Hag is a factor they’ll likely play up. Their presence in next season’s Champions League (barring a late-season disaster) could also come into Rice’s thinking.\nRice is understood to favour remaining in London and that is an obstacle United will have to overcome. However, United reportedly believe they can sway Rice’s mind and add him to the likes of Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in what is quickly becoming a world class midfield.\nA previous FI report claimed West Ham may recoup as little as £70m-£80m in the event only one suitor bids.\nHowever, given Man Utd, Man City, Arsenal and Chelsea all seem intent on making a move, any such bidding war is likely to see the £100m mark threatened.\nMAN CITY TABLE FORWARD OFFER\nMan City have lodged an offer that would improve Julian Alvarez’s terms, though Barcelona are sizing up what would be a shock loan raid, per reports.\nThe Argentine, 23, signed for City back in the winter window of 2022. Alvarez remained with River Plate until the summer before linking up at the Etihad in pre-season.\nAlvarez has looked incredibly bright in limited minutes for City thus far. The presence of Erling Haaland has blocked a regular pathway into the eleven, though he’s still bagged 10 goals in just 1,451 minutes of action. That roughly equates to a goal every game-and-a-half.\nPer Fabrizio Romano, Man City have liked what they’ve seen and put a one-year extension to Alvarez. His current deal expires in 2027 and if the new proposal is signed, will add an extra 12 months.\nAlvarez is reportedly yet to make a decision and will be given roughly a two-week period to respond before the offer could be rescinded.\nElsewhere, Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo reports Alvarez is a shock loan target for Barcelona.\nThe publication confirm Alvarez is in discussions over adding a year onto his City deal. However, it’s remarkably claimed he ‘does not rule out a loan’ to the Camp Nou.\nThe claim is he’s desperate for more prominence under Pep Guardiola – something that’s difficult to achieve with Haaland leading the line.\nAlvarez can play wide or in a front two, though Pep has the likes of Phil Foden, Jack Grealish and Riyad Mahrez to choose from on the flanks. The Spaniard doesn’t select a two-man frontline all that often either.\nBarca are sensing an opportunity and have reportedly explored whether a surprise loan deal for the 2023-24 campaign would be ‘feasible’.\nThe player may be willing, but logic would dictate City won’t be. In the event Haaland picks up an injury Alvarez would become the regular starting centre-forward.\nWhat’s more, despite his restricted minutes, Alvarez has still made a hefty 30 appearances across all competitions this season.\nWhether Alvarez signs the contract extension or not, a loan to Barcelona seems highly unlikely.\nCHELSEA SQUAD TO GROW EVEN LARGER\nChelsea’s squad will bloat even further over the summer after Inter Milan’s CEO confirmed Romelu Lukaku will return to Stamford Bridge.\nThe Belgian – a £97.5m signing in 2021 – was loaned back to former club Inter last summer.\nLukaku has struggled with form and fitness while back in Italy, though there’s always been talk a second loan spell or permanent move would be agreed.\nNow, speaking to Sky Sport Italia, Inter CEO Beppe Marotta confirmed Lukaku will return to London when the campaign concludes, though he does retain hope of forging a new agreement from scratch.\nMarotta said: “Will Lukaku stay at Inter? Talking about it now is premature.\n“At the moment we have the goal of finishing the season in the best possible way, then we will have to think about the hypotheses on the teams for next year and in this sense, [Inter sporting director Piero] Ausilio is doing a concrete job to identify the players in the positions righteous.\n“Lukaku is a Chelsea player today, at the end of the season he will return there and then a new scenario will open up and we’ll see what to do.\n“He wants to stay, it is an intention that he has expressed several times and certainly knowing him we will see if it will be the case to be able to negotiate his return with us.”",
