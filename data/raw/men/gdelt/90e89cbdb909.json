While walking from Haymarket Metro station towards the ground, I was tempted by a poster in the window of a branch of that omnipresent Gosforth-based bakery chain.\nThe details say as much about food price inflation as they do about my enormous appetite for unhealthy comestibles: four warm jumbo sausage rolls for £1.\nConsider it a tribute to the songwriting genius of the late Alan Hull that the challenge was accepted and polished off before I reached the turnstiles. That quartet of savoury porcine-centred snacks were certainly not “slippin’ down slowly”, though one or two might have been “slippin’ down sideways”!\nAny football fan worth his salt (not that it was needed that night) will tell you apparently random incidents can have a causal effect on your team’s fortunes. Thus, I felt duty-bound to repeat the awesome foursome trick on my next visit to the Cathedral on the Hill, especially because we had been in poor form when kicking off against the Hammers.\nThank goodness the coincidence proved to be just that; two unconnected but equally memorable events. Further culinary research confirmed beyond doubt that the goalscoring prowess of the lesser-known Best was in no way influenced by my consumption of meaty pastries. Trust me, I tried . . .\nThe 14 years since that remarkable night seemed to pass in a flash when I boarded the 13.36 at Brighton on Saturday, bound for the Amex, to be greeted by the unmistakable aroma of Greggs. Four United fans were squeezed round a table in carriage five, tucking into the usual fare, though they seemed to be sticking to the sensible rule of one mouth, one pastry. If only they had eaten not wisely but too well, they might have returned to Tyneside with three points . . .\nAll of which brings me back to this season, last season and the two before that.\nConsidering King Eddie has guided United to finishes of fourth, seventh and fifth so far, all highly creditable in the circumstances, his team have started each campaign no more than moderately.\nIn 2022-23, we garnered 11 points from two wins and five draws in the opening eight games, losing only once. That defeat, incidentally, featured the first recorded appearance at Anfield of an infamous Swedish striker. Whatever happened to him . . .\nThe season ended with four wins and three draws from our final eight games, a haul of 15 points that secured our return to the Champions League for the first time in a generation. In the home straight we stumbled rather than stormed to fourth place but we were good enough to total four points more than Liverpool, with a far superior goal difference.\nWouldn’t it be sweet if history repeated itself.\nThe 2023-24 Premier League campaign started with that 5-1 defeat of Aston Villa, the first of four wins and a draw in eight games. A decent tally of 13 points from a possible 24 looked promising. What a curse the word “promising” can be, as Cassandra discovered in Greek myth.\nBeset by injuries and the long-term suspension of Sandro Tonali, we fell away in mid-season. Six defeats between December 7 and January 13 cost us any chance of a top four finish. Despite those blows, the eight-match run-in featured five wins and a draw for a total of 16 points. A pattern is emerging here.\nLast season, free of European commitments, we managed three wins, three draws and two losses in the first eight games. Twelve points is better than mid-table, though not much better. Fair to middling, you might say.\nSix consecutive league wins between mid-December and mid-January were far more than middling. They helped to build the momentum that carried us to glory at Wembley on March 16.\nThe Premier League run-in was not as impressive as in previous seasons: we lost three of the final eight games, won four and drew the other to accrue 13 points. Despite those defeats, United extended their record under Howe of gaining more points on the last lap of the season than on the first.\nIn 2022-23, four more. In 2023-24, three more. Last season, one more.\nIs this the sign of a high-energy team who run out of gas before the job is done? From where I’m looking, it suggests a team with the ability and spirit to recover from an uncertain start. United string together winning runs when the chips are down, as long as sausage rolls are avoided!\nOur next two Premier League fixtures, at home against Fulham and away to West Ham, at first glance seem eminently winnable. The bookies have made us odds-on to claim six points. A total of 15 from the first 10 games would do wonders for morale.\nTake a closer look, however, and the picture becomes murkier.\nLewis Hall and Tino Livramento are big misses. The same cannot be said with certainty for Yoane Wissa, simply because he is yet to play for us. What is obvious, though, is that Nick Woltemade needs at least one other forward to share the burden.\nConsider the schedule. The Fulham match will kick off about 90 hours after the Champions League tie against Benfica ends. There is even less recovery time between the League Cup game against Tottenham and the trip to “the London Stadium”.\nAs if all that didn’t add to the challenge, we host Bilbao on Guy Fawkes Night, three days after playing West Ham. Four days later, away at Brentford. Busy, busy, busy.\nYou might think the November international break will be a welcome interlude for our overworked players but, using the first half at Brighton as a yardstick, such interruptions to the club’s season do more harm than good.\nSearching for positives, we were the better team in the second half at the Amex. Jacob Ramsey is fit again, Lewis Miley did well as a substitute and Jacob Murphy looked dynamic.\nWhatever happens between now and November 9 will go a long way towards shaping our season. Onward and upwards, lads.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
