  "body_text": "Tottenham Hotspur legend Erik Lamela retired from football two weeks ago, ending a 16-year professional football career that started with River Plate in his home country of Argentina and ending at AEK Athens in Greece. His longest stop was at Spurs, where he spent eight years and was one of the ubiquitous “Bale Seven” in 2013. He recently hung up his boots and joined Sevilla, where he spent a few years after leaving Tottenham, as a member of their coaching staff, but he has repeatedly said that he’ll always be a Spurs fan.\nMan City 0-2 Tottenham: Player ratings to the theme of Erik Lamela moments\nBuild the statue.\nLamela was supposed to be a monster footballer with limitless potential when Spurs purchased him from Roma, but he never quite lived up to his expectations. He didn’t become a world-beater and only scored 17 league goals in 177 appearances. Instead, Spurs fans loved (and still love) him for the way he embraced the club, becoming as big of a Spurs supporter as any fan. He was a quintessential shithouse and a master of the Dark Arts — a hard-tackling, trolling, banteriffic player who wasn’t afraid to put the shiv into a dude on the pitch and was painfully, almost shockingly one-footed. He became a Spurs cult favorite for his on-pitch antics and for just being an incredible guy. He was one of those players whom you loved if he was on your team and would loathe to the core of your being if he played for literally any team.\nI miss him. Build the statue.\nSo after a fantastic (and hilarious) 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Emirates that briefly took Spurs to the top of the Premier League table, let’s remember Erik Lamela. Here are your Tottenham Hotspur player ratings for their latest win over Pep’s City to the theme of Erik Lamela Moments™.\nFive stars: That rabona goal\nYeah. That goal ruled, especially because it came against Arsenal. It continues to astound me that Lamela was so left-footed that he found it easier to wrap his left around his right rather than actually attempt a right-footed shot.\nPape Sarr (Community — 4.5): I did Pape a little dirty in the post-match, but only because my bullet was focused on his first half performance and how he didn’t exactly fit what I expected from a 10. I don’t especially like him at that position, but I love the guy to bits and I can’t argue with the results. He was all over the place vs. City, breaking up play and covering every inch of grass. Outstanding overall performance against a very good team. My MOTM (and the league’s).\nPalhinha (Community — 4.5): Look. I said what I said about Palhinha before he signed and I hold to the opinion that he was not the kind of player I was hoping Spurs to sign. But that doesn’t mean I can’t appreciate a rock solid performance. Palhinha will never be a good passer, but he was an outstanding lock-down defensive midfielder against City, and took his goal well. I probably need to start appreciating what he does more than what I wish he did.\nThomas Frank (Community — 4.5): If this is what we can expect from a Thomas Frank coached side, I think we’re in for a lot of fun. Even though we all expected a back three, you could see Frank’s plan from the beginning and his player executed it perfectly.\n4.5 stars: That other rabona goal\nAs much as I love the Arsenal goal, I personally think this one, against Asteras Tripolis in the 2014 Europa League, is my favorite. This was the first time he’d done the rabona and it was one of the most absurd things I’ve ever seen in a live Tottenham match. Literally couldn’t believe it.\nCuti Romero (Community — 4.0): I criticized him for his performance against Burnley but he bounced back in this one and basically pocketed Haaland. His best tackle, among many, was the one he got booked for on Oscar Bobb, which was a ridiculous call by the match official. Wonderful game.\nRicharlison (Community — 4.0): Didn’t score, but not for lack of trying. Excellent pass to Johnson for the assist, and went close a couple of times including a couple of miscued header. Pressed the hell out of everyone. Put one in the net and it’s an easy five star match for Richy.\nMohammed Kudus (Community — 4.5): An absolute beast on the right for Spurs. City could barely keep him contained. His dribbling ability caused havoc with their back line; the ball just seemed to stick to him whenever he received it. Also did some solid defensive work against Doku.\n4 stars: That time he called Jack Wilshere a “p***y”\nLook, I don’t like that word. I find it offensive, misogynist, and extremely disrespectful. But holy crap was it hilarious when this happened in 2018, a 1-0 Spurs win. It sparked a full-time brawl and was glorious to watch. That image of Lamela smirking at an obviously incensed Wilshere is a strong candidate for the inevitable Erik Lamela statue.\nGuglielmo Vicario (Community — 4.0): Spurs’ defense was good enough that Vic probably wasn’t as active as we all expected, but he made a number of outstanding stops. His only blemish was a miscommunication with Micky van de Ven on a rolled ball that nearly led to a goal.\nMicky van de Ven (Community — 4.0): Flew in for a number of good blocks and used his pace well to harness City’s attackers. Was lucky not to give away a penalty for stepping on Bobb’s foot.\nDjed Spence (Community — 4.5): Tested a few times in transition, but had an excellent overall performance and linked up well with the offense.\nRodrigo Bentancur (Community — 4.0): A quietly excellent performance. I’m not sure I can point to any one thing he did that stood out, but he definitely didn’t put a foot wrong in midfield.\n3.5 stars: That time he stepped on Cesc Fabregas’ hand and pretended he didn’t see him\nLamela was a shithouse king and this perfectly illustrates why — a 2016 match against Chelsea where Lamela casually walks past a grounded Cesc Fabregas, stepping on his hand in the process. I mean, even if you want to give Erik the benefit of the doubt, there’s no way that a) he didn’t see him and b) that wasn’t 100% intentional. And just a perfect play-dumb-face from that moment on. THAT is what I think his statue should be.\nBrennan Johnson (Community — 4.0): First things first: lovely goal and well taken. I’m going to say it again: Brennan Johnson is a limited player who does a lot of things mediocre-to-fine and one thing really really well: making runs into space and scoring goals. Players like that are super useful, and I’m glad we have a poacher on our team, but that doesn’t make Johnson immune to criticism for things like making bad passes/crosses, not pressing effectively, poor touches, and lazily getting back from offside positions which killed several attacks in this match. I think it’s awesome he scored on Saturday and that, like Nacer Chadli, he keeps popping up to bang in goals. I cheer just as loud as the rest of you when it happens. I just wish he did a lot more than that, and I thought his overall performance on Saturday was mediocre. Feel this rating is generous.\nPedro Porro (Community — 4.0): Weird game for Pedro. Lashed a shot into side netting after putting a free kick into the wall, had a couple of decent crosses in, but got torched a couple of times against Marmoush, nearly gifted City an easy goal, and his defensive struggles meant he never really got going offensively. Not a poor match, but not a great one either.\nWilson Odobert (Community — 3.5): I tried to loan Odobert to Roma this week and while if Savinho comes he’s still looking at a reduced role, he looked quite bright when he came on vs. City, including blitzing past Rodri. Fun cameo.\n3 stars: That time he two-foot tackled a Burnley player and then nicked a water bottle from the Burnley physios\nThis is just quintessentially Lamela — putting in a hilariously bad studs-up tackle on Burley’s Dwight McNeil that resulted in McNeil receiving treatment from the physios, only for him to casually walk by and steal a water bottle from the Burnley physios. It was one of those “Wait… did he just do what I think he did?” moments and it still makes me giggle.\nDominic Solanke (Community — 3.5): Probably should’ve scored a goal, didn’t. Oh well. Pressed well in his late cameo, and I assume he’s still being worked into full fitness.\n2.5 stars: That time he nutmegged Andros Townsend so bad he had to get hair plugs\nThis is such a rude thing to do to a friend and former teammate. If you look close, you can actually see the exact moment Andros’ soul leaves his body. You can’t really see it here, but Danny Rose is in the background going full Surrender Cobra in amazement. I can only assume Andros’ subsequent hair transplant was an attempt to no longer be recognized as “the guy Lamela did THAT to.”\nNo players here, just filling out the categories.\n2 stars: That time he got Anthony Martial sent off for getting lightly slapped in the face\nClassic Erik. Just before a corner in a COVID-era match against Manchester United, Lamela baited Martial into lightly slapping him in the face. Erik went down like he had been shot, and the match official gave Martial a straight red card. Replay showed it was the lightest of light touches, Lamela was 100% faking injury, and had forearmed shivered Martial in the scrum just seconds before the incident. Amazing example of the Dark Arts, but gotta admit it was just a little embarrassing.\nJust filling out categories.\n1 star: His (singluar) red card\nDon’t have a video of this, but aside from the rabonas and the shithousery, the other thing Lamela was known for was never getting sent off. All those hard tackles, the shithousing, the Argie-bargie… he never earned more than a yellow card, right up until that NLD where he scored the rabona and he picked up two yellows in the 2-1 loss. It was one of his last matches for the club, but it only very slightly diminishes his legacy.\nNo Tottenham Hotspur players were as bad as Lamela picking up a red card and being sent off in a North London Derby.\nTom Carroll Memorial Non-Rating\nLucas Bergvall, Kevin Danso",
