Credit to Steve Kay from Football Transfers for shedding light on the Gunners’ latest interest, as the North London club sets its sights on the promising 19-year-old Israel international.\nScouting Mission in Austria\nDuring a recent Austrian Bundesliga clash against FC Blau Weiss Linz, Arsenal’s scouts were present to witness Gloukh in action. Despite the match ending in a 1-1 draw, which left Salzburg only three points clear at the top of the table, Gloukh’s performance did not go unnoticed. The young midfielder, who operates effectively as a No.10, showcased his skills with four shots and five key passes, touching the ball 81 times and winning 71% of his duels.\nGloukh’s Growing Influence\nSteve Kay notes, “The competition to land the player is set to be steep, with Barcelona among the clubs monitoring the teenager.” This speaks volumes about Gloukh’s rising stock in European football. Since his move from Maccabi Tel Aviv for €7 million just over a year ago, he has been a revelation, contributing six goals and seven assists across all competitions this season, including vital goals in the Champions League against heavyweights like Benfica and Inter.\nMarket Value and International Recognition\nFootball Transfers’ algorithm places Gloukh’s Estimated Transfer Value (ETV) at €16.4m, a substantial increase from €6.1m in the summer. This sharp rise reflects not only his club performances but also his impact at the international level, where he has scored three goals in 12 matches for Israel.\nArsenal’s Strategic Move\nAs Arsenal continues to scout Gloukh, their proactive approach indicates a keen interest in nurturing young talent capable of making a significant impact. With Barcelona also in the mix, the race to secure Gloukh’s signature will undoubtedly be intriguing. Arsenal’s presence in Austria to scout him directly underscores their serious intent and commitment to strengthening their squad with top-tier young talent.\nIn summary, Oscar Gloukh represents a beacon of potential for clubs across Europe. Arsenal’s targeted scouting of the Salzburg wonderkid, as detailed by Steve Kay, highlights the competitive nature of modern football’s talent acquisition strategies. As the summer transfer window approaches, all eyes will be on Gloukh’s next move.\nStatistical Analysis by EPL Index: Oscar Gloukh’s Emerging Talent\nOscar Gloukh, the Red Bull Salzburg prodigy, has been turning heads with his exceptional performances on the pitch. Thanks to comprehensive performance data and stats provided by Fbref, a deeper analysis into Gloukh’s contributions can be undertaken, revealing why he’s such a sought-after talent.\nPerformance Data: Impressive Creative Metrics\nGloukh’s data from the last 365 days, against attacking midfielders and wingers, positions him in the upper echelon of young prospects. His performance chart illustrates a player with remarkable attacking prowess, particularly in areas critical for an advanced midfielder. His non-penalty expected goals (npxG) and expected assists (xA) numbers are striking, showcasing his ability to not only create chances but also to finish them.\nWith an impressive percentile rank in non-penalty goals, Gloukh demonstrates a lethal edge in front of goal. This is complemented by his shot-creating actions, highlighting his role as a catalyst in offensive plays. Despite a moderate percentile in total shots, his precision and decision-making when opting to shoot contribute significantly to his team’s attacking threats.\nStats Spotlight: Passing and Possession\nIn possession metrics, Gloukh’s performance is equally noteworthy. His pass completion percentage and the number of progressive passes he’s made place him among the most reliable and forward-thinking midfielders. Such stats underline his vision on the field, his understanding of the game’s flow, and his technical quality in distributing the ball.\nThe data underscores Gloukh’s tendency to drive play forward, evidenced by his rank in progressive carries and successful take-ons. These stats not only speak to his confidence with the ball at his feet but also his ability to break lines and challenge defences with directness and agility.\nTactical Impact: Defending and Duels\nWhile primarily an attacking force, Gloukh’s stats indicate a well-rounded approach to his game. His percentile for aerials won, while not at the top, suggests a willingness to contest and contribute in various phases of play. This aspect of his game may not be his headline attribute but reflects a versatile player capable of adapting to different tactical requirements.\nIn conclusion, Oscar Gloukh’s performance data and stats reveal a player with a blend of creativity, precision, and an all-encompassing skill set that makes him an invaluable asset to any team. With his current trajectory, it’s no surprise that elite clubs are keeping a close eye on his development.",
