They might be the best team in Europe at this moment,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said of playing City.\n\"We have all the confidence in the world. If you want to win the Champions League, you have to beat City.”\nKylian Mbappé's path to a first Champions League title with Paris Saint-Germain in his farewell season there will next go through Barcelona.\nPSG hosts the first leg as coach Luis Enrique faces his former club, which he led to the 2015 title with a Barcelona team that included Lionel Messi and Neymar - who were later reunited in Paris for two seasons.\nArsenal was drawn to play the first leg at home against Bayern Munich, whose star striker Harry Kane will go back to north London after leaving the Gunners' archrival Tottenham this offseason.\nThe trophy is displayed ahead of the 2023-2024 UEFA Champions League football tournament quarter-finals and semi-finals draw at the House of European Football in Nyon, on March 15, 2024. (Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP)\nAtletico Madrid was paired with Borussia Dortmund in the other game, with the German club having the advantage of hosting the second leg. Atletico under coach Diego Simeone showed again they are a fearsome force at the Metropolitano Stadium by ousting Inter Milan on Wednesday.\nDortmund coach Edin Terzic called Atletico \"a strong opponent which is especially a little monster in knockout games.” The Real Madrid-Man City games will be the top attraction even despite their many recent meetings. City also beat Madrid in the round of 16 in 2020.\n\"We need to remember that we beat them last season in the semifinal and we played at home in the second leg,\" Man City director of football Txiki Begiristain said, recalling a 4-0 win last May after a 1-1 draw in Madrid.\nUEFA also made the draw for the semifinals, which ensured Mbappé and PSG cannot meet Real Madrid - the team he is expected to join in the summer - until the final.\nThat draw arguably put the four strongest teams in the same half. When the new Champions League format takes effect next season, the two strongest teams in the expanded eight-game first phase will be seeded in a tennis-style knockout bracket and could not meet until the final.\nThis time, the winner between Real Madrid and Man City - who were the only teams to win all six games in the group stage - will be away in the first leg against Arsenal or Bayern.\n\"We certainly have the most difficult path ahead of us that you can imagine,” Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel said.\nBayern fans will be banned from the first leg against Arsenal in London because of a UEFA punishment for supporters setting off fireworks and throwing them toward the pitch at two previous games this season.\nA potential Arsenal-Man City meeting in the semifinals would make it three games between them in less than six weeks.\nThey play in the Premier League in Manchester on March 31 in a game that could have a major impact on a tight Premier League title race also involving Liverpool.\n\"We have been winning all games so we hope that we can keep this rhythm. Mentally we are strong,\" Begiristain said.\nArsenal reached the quarterfinals for the first time since 2010 by beating Porto on penalties and leads the Premier League on goal difference ahead of Liverpool.\n\"We are not scared of anyone,\" Arsenal sporting director Edu said. \"We are in a good momentum as a team.”\nAtletico or Dortmund will host the first leg of its semifinals against PSG or Barcelona.\nThere was a familiar and powerful look to the draw. It featured five European champions - who have combined to win 27 of the previous 68 titles - and three beaten finalists: Arsenal, Atletico and PSG.\nThe semifinals are played between April 30 and May 8. The final is on June 1 at Wembley Stadium in London.\nThe last Champions League final played at Wembley was a German derby in 2013 that Bayern won 2-1 against Dortmund. A repeat is still possible after Friday's draws.\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
