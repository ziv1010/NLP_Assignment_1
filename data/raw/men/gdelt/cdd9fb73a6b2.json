It will be a really exciting tie. I’m really excited about the way my team are playing.”\nHe did admit that results have not gone the way he had planned, but he is content with the performances. He also highlighted the challenge of playing Juventus, a team who play in a very different style to what they are used to facing.\nSkinner also claimed that United would do everything in their power to finish ahead of the Italians in the table. Juventus are currently one point but five places ahead of United in fourth.\nElaborating on this, he stated the Italians will have different strengths in comparison to Lyon and added, “I think it’s just big-game moments, a different style of refereeing as well – that also plays a part. We just need to make sure we’re fully focused on what we are, who we are with the ball. If we can do that, we can cause problems for any team.”\nUnited will face Juventus at the Allianz Stadium and Skinner commented, “it’s such an iconic stadium, and I think both teams will enjoy playing here. It’s part and parcel of being in the best competition in Europe, and we’re looking forward to the challenge.”\nGrowth of Women’s football in Italy\nSkinner also added that he has not only been impressed with how the Old Lady have conducted themselves in this year’s tournament but also the general growth of women’s football in the country.\nHe added, “it shows a lot about the growth of the Italian league that a player like [former Arsenal midfielder] Lia Walti has come to play for Juve. I see a lot of talent in their team and a lot of talent in this league.”\nSkinner finally stated, “to take on an Italian giant like Juve in this final game is fitting and it’s a good thing for us to do.”\nJess Park\nThe summer signing was alongside Skinner in the press conference and expressed her joy at being a part of this United team.\nShe explained, “you can tell by the way that I’m playing at the moment how much I’m enjoying it. I love every single one of the girls and I love playing for United. I’ve competed in it [the Champions League] before. I enjoy any game, any challenge and I think this is the biggest competition, so of course I’ll try to bring that as well.”\nFeatured image Ben Roberts Photo via Getty Images\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade.
