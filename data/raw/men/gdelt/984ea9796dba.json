  "body_text": "According to a report by South American outlet Bola VIP, Chelsea have withdrawn from negotiations for Club Brugge’s Joel Ordóñez. It was said that Stamford Bridge was the player’s preferred destination, but the London club’s withdrawal has paved the way for a move to Liverpool FC. However, Inter Milan is said to be still monitoring the situation closely.\nRumour Mongering: Chelsea Drop Out of Ordoñez Race\nThis seems to pave the way for a Liverpool move.\nThe 21-year-old Ecuadorian defender is actually a familiar name from earlier this summer, as he was also briefly linked with a move to Anfield before Liverpool eventually settled on Giovanni Leoni.\nIt may seem a little curious why Liverpool would ask a defender playing in the Belgian Pro League to make a giant leap towards playing in the Premier League, but Brugge had a very good Champions League campaign for their standards last season, and about 20% of Ordóñez’s 100+ appearances for the club have been made in Europe’s premier competition.\nOrdóñez’s standout traits include his passing and general composure on and off the ball, which have made him one of the more promising young centre-backs in European football. Liverpool seem to be prioritising defenders who are good on the ball, with the failed chase for Marc Guehi and the signing of Leoni over the summer highlighting their desire for defenders of that profile.\nWith Leoni out for the season, Liverpool need some bodies in that department, and they can fulfil both long- and short-term needs if they choose to pursue Ordóñez. The player is expected to cost around €40m. Liverpool do have some good history with centre-backs named Joel, so we’ll see if this one gains further traction as the winter transfer window opens.",
