  "body_text": "Bahrain's Al Ahli Club were yesterday drawn in a tough Group C for the opening round of the all-new Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Challenge League.\nThe AFC Challenge League is the third-tier continental club competition under the AFC banner, below the top-rung AFC Champions League (ACL) Elite and the ACL Two.\nThe Bahrainis are joined in their pool by Al Futowa SC of Syria, Hilal Al Quds of Palestine, and Al Seeb Club of Oman, who will host the group matches.\nEach group has a centralised host, with every side playing their opponents once over three match days from October 26 to November 2.\nYesterday’s draw took place in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It split the 18 participating clubs into the AFC Challenge League’s five groups – three of which are in West Asia comprising four teams apiece, with the other two in East Asia involving three teams each.\nJoining Oman as group hosts from West Asia are Bhutan and Kuwait, while Myanmar and Mongolia are the hosts from East Asia.\nThe other countries being represented in the competition are from India, Lebanon, Bangladesh, Turkmenistan, Maldives, Kyrgyzstan, Chinese Taipei, Laos, Indonesia, and Cambodia.\nAhli claimed their place in the AFC Challenge League after losing to Kuwait SC in their single-game play-off for a place in the ACL Two.\nFollowing the group stage, the three West group winners and one best runners-up will join the top two finishers of each group from the East to form the eight team quarter-finals. This will comprise double-legged ties to be contested between March 5 and 13, 2025.\nThat will then set the stage for the semi-finals, which are scheduled from April 9 to 17, and then the final will be held on May 10 next year.\nThe AFC Challenge League has replaced the tournament formerly known as the AFC President’s Cup, which ran from 2005 to 2014. It has been rebranded by the AFC for the upcoming 2024-25 season and beyond.\nThe winners of the inaugural AFC Challenge League will pocket $1 million, while the runners-up will get $500,000.\npatrick@gdnmedia.bh",
