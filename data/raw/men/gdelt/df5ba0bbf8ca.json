The intense match at the Estadio Alfredo Di Stefano showed that the reigning champions had set their heart out on retaining their title.\nOn the flip side, it was a difficult night for Chelsea FC after a second succeeding defeat in the semifinals of the Champions League.\nReal Madrid's Commanding Lead Over Chelsea\nAs per a report by Straits Times, Real Madrid began the game with a controlling lead versus Chelsea, as they played at their home in the Estadio Alfredo Di Stefano. Even at the start, the reigning champions have control over the game's tempo.\nAfter 21 minutes since Kepa Arrizabalaga tipped a Vinicius Junior, Karim Benzema scored a close-range goal.\nEven if Madrid had its dominating possession and controlled game from the start, it took the team a while to score their second goal. To be precise, Asensio netted the second goal at the 74-minute mark of the match, giving the 14-time winners a commanding lead against Chelsea.\nThe coach of Real Madrid, Carlo Ancelotti, notes in an interview that while they are well pleased with the performance in their match against Chelsea, it is far from being over. Ancelotti said in an interview, \"[they] are satisfied with the result, for the performance.\" But despite that, he reminds everyone that \"it's not over yet. We have to fight and sacrifice for another 90 minutes at Stamford Bridge.\"\nHe does not expect Chelsea to back down easily, adding that the opposing football club \"will try to [give] everything next week.\"\nRead Also : NFL WR Michael Jefferson Suffers Serious Injuries Requiring Surgeries in Multi-Car Crash in Alabama\nChelsea Plans Overturn 2-0 Deficit in Second Leg\nThe interim boss of Chelsea, Frank Lampard, still sees a bright fate ahead despite suffering two successive defeats, according to BBC. He trusts that they could still turn things around even if they are suffering from a 2-0 deficit in the hands of Madrid. After all, they must do so if they wish to advance to the Champions League semi-finals.\nHowever, BBC notes that if they want a stark overturn, the players of the Chelsea interim boss need to show us something they failed to do in their recent games. The British news outlet adds that they need to score twice in the match against Madrid next Tuesday.\nWith that in mind, Lampard feels that \"special things can happen\" in the meetup of the two football clubs, wherein the Blues have to give it their all to turn around their deficit. Nevertheless, ESPN reports that Chelsea's interim boss still admitted that it would be a big challenge for them to turn things around \"against a team with the quality of Real Madrid.\"\nRelated Article : YouTuber Jake Paul, Ex-UFC Star Nate Diaz Boxing Match Confirmed-Date, Time, Location\n© 2026 HNGN, All rights reserved.
