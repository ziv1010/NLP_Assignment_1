Luckily she did not get a concussion from the powerful strike.\nCommenting on her heroes in the team she added, “when I was younger, I was actually a forward player. There’s lots of favourites, but I used to love Rooney. I just loved his attitude and his desire, his resilience. He just didn’t care about anything other than playing football, and you could see that in his performances.”\nShe also revealed her admiration for the defensive partnership of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic. The 28 year old was impressed generally by the whole side and claimed, “we had an unbelievable team and it’s a great one to remember.”\nUnited way\nGeorge stated that Marc Skinner’s side would be proud to emulate some of the traditions of Sir Alex Ferguson’s great sides in Europe.\nShe elaborated, “as a Manchester United fan you always knew about ‘Fergie Time’, with them coming back to score late on in games. I’d like to think that’s something that we can do if we need to. It’s about digging deep and showing that Manchester United mentality. That’s what it’s all about.”\nGeorge also revealed that she has met Sir Alex a couple of times but that she is “gutted” that she has never been able to get a photo with the great man.\nFinal aim\nThe defender spoke of her joy as a supporter when Paul Scholes rifled in the winner versus FC Barcelona in the 2008 semi-final to take the team to the Champions League final.\nShe then claimed that the Women’s team would love to match this achievement this year by asserting, “growing up and being a fan, living through these moments, I think it would be amazing for us to go and do it. We’ve got a long road ahead of us but I think the mentality that we show as a team, every game we want to try and win – nothing changes, whether it’s Champions League or the league.”\nGeorge continued, “it would be an amazing moment, not just for us but the club in general. We would be the first Manchester United women’s team to do it, but like I said we take one game at a time and see where it takes us.”\nHistoric night\nNext week’s match will be the first ever Women’s Champions League match at Old Trafford and George cannot hide her excitement as a local.\nShe concluded, “it’s going to be amazing and very special for the history of the club. We’re not here just here to make up the numbers and have these special days out. We’re here to compete at the highest level and that’s what we want to do on the day.”\nGabby George career stats\nSouce: Wikipedia\nFeature image Alex Livesey via Getty Images\n–\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade.
