A final decision has not yet been reached but a number of officials at the club believe Conte's position is untenable.\nHow did we get here?\nTottenham's surge into the top four last season had fans and neutrals convinced of a potential title charge this time around. However, things simply never got off the ground and Spurs have failed to produce consistent performances.\nThe north London side's season was still alive in early March but exits from the FA Cup and Champions League stunk of mismanagement and poor tactics before Conte let loose at Southampton following a 3-3 draw.\nHe accused his players of being 'selfish' and insinuated the club's board had fostered a culture of continual failure.\nREAD NEXT\nConte said: “The coach is responsible, the club is responsible...the players have to take their responsibility because what we have seen in the last few months, I don’t like. I’m not used to seeing these types of situation. I see a lot of selfish players and I don’t see a team.\n“Tottenham's story is this. 20 years there is the owner and they never won something. Why?\n“Until now I try to hide the situation. But there are ten games to go. People think we can fight? Fight for what? With this attitude, this spirit, this commitment. For seventh? Eighth place? I am really upset.\n“If they want to continue in this way, they can change the manager, a lot of managers, but the situation cannot change. Believe me.“\nWhat is next for Tottenham?\nIn the immediate short-term, regardless of the manager who fills the dugout, Spurs have ten games left to secure a top four spot and Champions League football next season. Newcastle are now in the driving seat, sitting two points behind Tottenham with two games in hand.\nHarry Kane is still giving his all in an attempt to haul in Erling Haaland in the Golden Boot race, though his 21 goals rank firmly second to the Norwegian giant's 28.\nThere's plenty that needs to be fixed at Tottenham before they can start challenging at the top of the Premier League again. Why not take a look at who 90min blame for their horrendous state of affairs?",
