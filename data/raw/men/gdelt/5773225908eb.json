Forward, Australia\nThe Australian helped Chelsea to their fourth straight English Super League title this year in another dominant season for the London club.\nKerr joined the Blues in 2020 after playing in the United States.\nHowever, her senior career started as a 15-year-old with Perth Glory in the W-League, and at the same age she played her first international.\nThe now 29-year-old has played the most games and scored the most goals for her country.\nShe competed in the 2011, 2015 and 2019 World Cups and the 2016 and 2020 Olympics.\nKerr played a prominent part of their 2020 Olympics scoring a hat-trick in one game and helping her side to a fourth place finish.\nShe has regularly been nominated for Player of the Year awards and it was announced she would be the first female player to feature on the cover of the Ultimate edition of the FIFA video game.\nAustralia will be relying on the forward's scoring talent to make an impression in the World Cup and progress past the quarter-finals for the first time.\nChristine Sinclair - Forward, Canada\nIf experience counts for anything then the ageless Canadian forward must count as one of the greats of the game.\nThe 39-year-old has played 324 games for her country and scored 190 goals ... a world-wide leading tally.\nAfter making her debut for the senior team at the age of 16, Sinclair helped Canada to a fourth place finish at the 2003 World Cup.\nShe played her 300th match during the Tokyo Olympics, helping her side to the gold medal with an upset win over the United States in the semi-finals and then a penalty shootout win over Sweden in the final.\nThe Canadians did not have the smoothest build-up to the tournament with players striking over pay equity at the beginning of the year.\nSinclair has been nominated for the FIFA Women's World Player of the Year Award seven times and has been named Canada's Player of the Year 14 times.\nThis World Cup will be her sixth, and despite her age, it should not be expected that she won't be at the top of her game.\nShe is fast and physical with great ball skills and will again be a danger in front of the goal as Canada look to carry their Olympic form into the World Cup.\nLena Oberdorf - Midfielder, Germany\nThe young midfielder was one of the standout players at last year's European Championship, winning the young player of the tournament award and helping her side to the final.\nShe is tireless on attack and defence and is at the heart of the German midfield.\nOberdorf has a great pass and is also praised for her ability to win the ball in the tackle, while many praise her for her maturity on the field despite her young age.\nThe 21-year-old played a significant part in her club Wolfsburg's progress to the final of the Champions League this year, where they were beaten by Barcelona.\nShe played for the German under-15 side in 2014 and has progressed through the age group system every year since and made her debut for the senior side in the build-up to the 2019 World Cup.\nHer emerging talent has many in Germany optimistic about the national side in the coming years.\nAlongside captain and star striker Alexandra Popp, Oberdorf and the rest of the German side should be contenders to make the final.\nAsisat Oshoala - Striker, Nigeria\nThe striker is the standout player in a lowly ranked Nigerian team and her performance at the World Cup will play a big part in how the African nation performs.\nOshoala played a big part in Barcelona's La Liga title last season, scoring 20 goals in 19 games.\nShe also scored four goals in Barca's campaign to win the Champions League title - becoming the first African to win the title.\nThe 28-year-old has also be named African Women's Footballer of the Year five times and has been described by many commentators as the greatest African female player.\nPlus, she is the only African player to be nominated for the Ballon d'Or.\nAfter starring in the 2014 Under-20 World Cup, Oshoala was picked up by Liverpool before moving to Arsenal and then to China before landing in Barcelona.\nShe was vice-captain of the Super Falcons team at the 2019 World Cup, helping her side to the round of 16 where they were beaten by Germany.\nOshoala has a number of nicknames including \"Seedorf\" after male footballer Clarence Seedorf, \"Agba Baller\" meaning legendary footballer, and \"Superzee\" by her team-mates.\nOshoala has a foundation supporting young female players in Africa.\nAlex Morgan - Striker, USA\nThe American striker was destined to be a star of the game after being the number one pick out of college in 2011.\nShe went straight into the US squad for the 2011 World Cup and has played in every tournament since, helping them to the title in 2015 and 2019.\nMorgan was runner-up in voting for the FIFA Best Women's Player Award in both 2019 and 2022.\nMorgan first played for the USA at under-20 level helping them win that title in 2008 and has now played more than 200 games for the senior side, scoring 121 goals.\nMorgan gave birth in 2020 and was back in the national side six months later and scored a goal against New Zealand at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 on their way to the bronze medal.\nThe 34-year-old is a dominate forward with speed to go with her aggression and with a top quality team around her can be expected to be in plenty of goal scoring situations during the 2023 tournament.\nChloe Kelly - Forward, England\nKelly was known as the super-sub for England, but, after scoring the extra time winning goal in the 2022 European Championship final against Germany, she has cemented her place in the starting line-up.\nShe missed almost 11 months of action after suffering an ACL injury in 2021, which forced her to miss the Olympics, but returned just in time for the Euros.\nKelly debuted for Arsenal in 2015, before moving to Everton and then onto Manchester City in 2020.\nSince joining City, she has scored 16 goals in 48 appearances and hit the back of the net six times in 25 appearances for the Lionesses.\nThe 25-year-old forward plays primarily on the right and is know for her deliveries into the box as well as her finishing.\nEngland are without some key players because of injury, including captain Leah Williamson and fellow forward Beth Mead, so a lot will be expected of Kelly to push England into at least the semi-finals.\nMarta - Forward, Brazil\nThe Brazilian legend is set to play her sixth and likely last World Cup. The 37-year-old is considered by many to be the greatest women's player of all time and has been named FIFA World Player of the Year six times.\nHer first World Cup was in 2003, while in 2007 she won the Golden Boot with sevens goals, helping Brazil to the final where they lost to Germany.\nMarta Vieira da Silva has scored 115 goals in 175 games for the national side. She holds the record for most goals scored in the World Cup with 17, and she became the first player (female or male) to score in five World Cups.\nMarta has also played five Olympics, capturing silver medals twice and in 2021 she became first player to score in five Olympics.\nShe is recovering from injury but she should provide Brazil with goal-scoring opportunities up front.\nMarta has exceptional skill and still has plenty of speed, but this year her greatest asset for Brazil could be her leadership.",
