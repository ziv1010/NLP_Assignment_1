Morocco, meanwhile, had already confirmed their spot at AFCON back in March.\nThat's bad news for Manchester United, however, who will therefore be without Cameroonian goalkeeper Andre Onana and Moroccan midfielder Sofyan Amrabat for at least a couple of weeks in January, with AFCON running from January 13 until February 11 next year.\nOnana started in the victory over Burundi upon his recall to the national team, just eight months after manager Rigobert Song sent him home from World Cup 2022 due to Onana's criticism of Song's long-ball tactics. The goalkeeper announced his retirement from international football in December 2022, but has since reneged on that decision after reconciling with Song.\nDepending on each nation's progress in AFCON, the pair could potentially miss up to nine games in total for Manchester United. Four Premier League games, against Tottenham Hotspur, Wolves, West Ham United and Aston Villa, are scheduled during the course of the tournament, while both legs of the League Cup semi-finals - if United reach that round - as well as the third and fourth rounds of the FA Cups fall within AFCON.\nThe first leg of the Champions League last 16 is also played just two days after the AFCON final, meaning it's unlikely either Onana or Amrabat would play if their country reaches that stage.\nVIDEO: What really happened between Jadon Sancho and Erik ten Hag\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nTen Hag will therefore need to turn his attention to new signing Altay Bayindir to replace Onana for those missed games, with the Turkish goalkeeper signed for £4.3m from Fenerbahce on deadline day.\nThe 25-year-old has played five times for his country, but is a slightly more traditional goalkeeper than Onana. While Onana loves to play with the ball at his feet, Bayindir is more comfortable and shot-stopping. He is forthright in his actions, though, and is confident at coming off of his line to claim crosses or close down the space for onrushing strikers.\nAmrabat, meanwhile, will have Casemiro and Scott McTominay playing in midfield instead of him.\nMore Manchester United stories\nUnited will be without Antony after the international break, with the winger delaying his return to training so that he can address assault allegations.\nMeanwhile, amid his public spat with Erik ten Hag after being dropped from the matchday squad, Jadon Sancho could be offered a lifeline by former club Borussia Dortmund.\nAnd Mikael Silvestre has reminisced in his United debut against Liverpool in an interview with FFT.\nRyan is a staff writer for FourFourTwo, joining the team full-time in October 2022.
