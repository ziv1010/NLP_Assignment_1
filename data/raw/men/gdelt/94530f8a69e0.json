Three days after that they will host Manchester City at the Santiago Bernabeu in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final.\nDuring the match against Almeria, Benzema scored his hat-trick in the first half and Rodrygo added the fourth early in the second for Madrid, while Lazaro and Lucas Robertone scored for the visitors.\nBenzema was denied by the woodwork in the final stages, while Madrid substitute Marco Asensio hit the post twice as Ancelotti´s side toyed with Almeria.\nThe hosts played eye-catching football despite the fact that the pitch at the Bernabeu has deteriorated, with the club planning to replace it before City visit in May.\n\"In attack the team is very dangerous, with the quality of Karim, Vini, Rodrygo, with the ball we play very well,\" Ancelotti told reporters.\n\"There are games where the offensive level looks very good, like today.\"",
