But I think that’s great. When he was little, I was playing for Mallorca. At that time, he supported Mallorca and Real Madrid, but then he was surprised when I moved to Barcelona, and he found it difficult to change.\nAdvertisement\n“I have no problem watching El Clasico with him. Sometimes, we’ve been travelling together and have watched the match together. It’s entertaining to watch it with a Madrid fan and a Barcelona fan, because the same image seems like different plays — not even VAR has fixed it! Rafa experiences the sport more intensely, I experience it more calmly, and what I like now is to watch a good match.\n“It’s intense, but it has improved. I think education in football has been improving. There are no ultras in both clubs, so I think that in sporting terms, it’s handled in a more tolerant way.”\nJorge Valdano: “There is a nationalist fervour concentrated around Real Madrid. But on the other hand, there is another element that contributes to the civility of El Clasico, which is that there are very few visiting fans at the matches. That would be unthinkable in England, for example.\n“Let’s say that it’s not a game associated with conflict, but rather with honour, and that ends up having a dimension that transcends sport.”\nCayetano Luis Martinez de Irujo y Fitz-James Stuart: “I think the rivalry depends a lot on who the manager is. There have also been chairmen who have turned it into a kind of pitched battle. Thankfully, they are the exceptions.”\nLorenzo Mila Mencos: “There’s always some nonsense, but in general it’s a healthy and fun rivalry, especially when you live in Madrid like I do and Barcelona win. The next day, no one talks about football.”\nFather Juan Manuel Gongora: “It’s a rivalry that has grown over the decades, fuelled from a political point of view by Catalan separatism since the 1990s, which has artificially distorted the nature of the sport. I think the rivalry reached its peak when Jose Mourinho took over as manager of Real Madrid and managed to put a stop to a historic period for Barca.\n“We could draw a Biblical parallel with the struggle between Jacob and Esau for Isaac’s birthright. Even though it was a terribly bitter relationship between strength and cunning, in the end, they reconciled.”\nAdvertisement\nSister Lucia Caram: “Rivalry is good; competition makes us grow. But we must try to ensure that money and interests that pervert the existence of football, which is what we are seeing, do not overshadow the best of the game and turn El Clasico, and football, into a market.\n“Barcelona is more than a club, and should be so not only on the pitch but also off it. It has to play to unite. El Clasico is passion, pride and soul, and God willing, they will score five goals again and we will give them (a goal).”\nDavid Campoy: “There is generally respect between the fans of both teams, but as everywhere else, there are more extreme people. I’m part of a group where about 80 to 90 of us get together every week to rehearse, and during the week of El Clasico there’s always a healthy rivalry between the Barca and Madrid fans.”\nDaniel Hernandez: “It’s one of the biggest rivalries I’ve ever seen, not just in football. A Barcelona fan will say one thing and you can’t contradict them, and the same goes for someone from Madrid. They’ll never admit anything. They’re yin and yang.”\nWhat’s your earliest memory of it? And what’s your favourite moment?\nNadal: “I have many memories of all the Clasicos. We won 5-0 once (in January 1994). It’s an important day for me. You feel something different at every moment; when you arrive at the stadium, when you step onto the pitch. In the intensity of it all, there are so many emotions. It attracts 100,000 spectators in the stadium and 500million people around the world. The thing is, when you’re a player, you’re more focused on the sporting side of things, and you realise more when you’re retired.”\nValdano: “My first memory is of a Clasico I played where I had to mark (German forward Bernd) Schuster, and then I scored. What surprised me most was the atmosphere.\nAdvertisement\n“If you ask me which one I remember most, it’s definitely (Luis) Figo’s return (to former club Barca as a Madrid player). What I experienced that night was something I had never seen before. I was a director and I remember sitting next to Alfredo di Stefano, who had been watching football for more than 60 years. He told me he had never seen anything like it; in Spain, Argentina or Colombia. He was completely blown away. It’s proof that when you love something so much, you hate it in equal measure.”\nMila: “Johan Cruyff and Hugo Sotil’s 5-0 win at the Bernabeu. I must have been 13 and I wasn’t very interested in football, but I often saw Johan Cruyff because he took his children to school, in that huge Citroen SM of his, next to my house in Barcelona. But my favourite moment is the 6-2 (victory for Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona) in 2009. I had a wedding to go to that day and, while looking for parking, I ran into a friend who supports Madrid. He teased me about them having already gone 1-0 up. By the time we found a place to park, it was 2-1, ha-ha.”\nFather Gongora: “My first memorable memory was the 5-0 win at the Santiago Bernabeu in January 1995. I was six years old, and that Saturday at the end of Christmas was a real gift from the Three Kings. As for my favourite moments, I can mention two: Zinedine Zidane’s goal in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals in 2002, and Cristiano Ronaldo’s tremendous goal from Angel di Maria’s cross in the 2011 Copa del Rey final.\nSister Caram: “Barca’s 5-0 defeat of Madrid in 2010 at the Camp Nou with Guardiola and Mourinho (as the two managers). It was a display of football, beauty, art… the statistics seemed miraculous. More than 700 passes; it was a symphony that drove the opposition crazy. The most curious thing is that, at the peak of my compatriot Lionel Messi’s career, he did not score in that match. But he did make a play that led to the third goal after dribbling past half of Madrid.\n“Messi looked up to the sky like no one else sees it and opened the door to paradise. Guardiola’s team preached with the ball, and the world of football understood it from that day on.”\nHernandez: “The galacticos era, with Raul, Roberto Carlos, Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane… those Clasicos were incredible for me, some of the best there have ever been. Football has changed. Now it’s more tactical and more physical. Before, players weren’t covered as much and it was easier for them to work their magic. Raul and Sergio Ramos were examples of what it means to be a pure Spaniard. We shared many experiences with Ramos, and when he was at Madrid, I told him that my favourite player was Isco. He agreed that he had played three incredible matches but that the most consistent player was Luka Modric.”\nWhat does El Clasico mean to you?\nCaram: “Without a doubt, El Clasico is more than just a match. I’m not going to say it’s a matter of Faith, but it is a way of experiencing football and football passion. Incidentally, it must be said that Barcelona is God’s team and it is impossible to surpass God, so we ask Madrid for a little humility and less arrogance.”\nAdvertisement\nNadal: “I experienced it intensely, with the mindset of knowing that it’s a match with a special impact. It stirs the emotions of a lot of people, even though there are only three points at stake. The players’ motivation in this match is different. Whether you like it or not, you live it throughout the week, it grows little by little, even in training. It’s a match that can shake your confidence a little, you can end up hurt. It’s the rivalry between the two main teams in Spain and almost in the world.”\nValdano: “Firstly, it’s the mainstay of La Liga right now. Secondly, it’s a match with sociological, cultural and political connotations. Thirdly, it’s a fascinating footballing duel because it tends to reveal the strengths and weaknesses of both sides in the most brutal way.”\nMartinez de Irujo: “It’s a world-class match of the highest calibre. Even though I switched to Atletico Madrid about 16 or 17 years ago, because I felt much more identified with them, I’m not anti-Real Madrid. What I value is the quality of the sport, and obviously these two teams are two of the 10 best teams in the world. There’s always an exceptional quality of play and sport that’s very enjoyable to watch, and that also reflects elite sport at its best.”\nMila: “El Clasico is tense and fun, especially if it is at the Bernabeu, because Barcelona really enjoy playing there.”\nGongora: “My family has been passionate about football and Real Madrid for generations. El Clasico has always been a family event, where we enjoy the victories and cheer each other up in defeat.”\nCampoy: “For me, El Clasico is the first match that really gets you nervous from the start of the day. They are always special, not only because of the match itself, but also because of all the build-up and the celebrations afterwards. It’s a day marked on the calendar.”\nHernandez: “El Clasico decides the season; it’s those three points you win or lose that can mean winning the league or not.”\nAdvertisement\nHow would you describe Real Madrid vs Barcelona in three words?\nNadal: “Rivalry, standards, ambition.”\nValdano: “Sports and socio-politics.”\nMartinez de Irujo: “High-level competitiveness.”\nMila: “Intense, historic, social.”\nGongora: “History, passion, entertainment.”\nCaram: “Competition, excitement, hope.”\nCampoy: “Tradition, passion, emotion.”\nHernandez: “Passion, effort, rivalry.”",
