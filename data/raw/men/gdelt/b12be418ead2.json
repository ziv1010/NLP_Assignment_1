Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Would be interesting to see how much he's getting paid at Leeds compared to what we were offering...as long as he is happy. Interested to hear his signing-on interview. Being a smart guy, he'll get the tone right.\n13 Posted 13/08/2025 at 11:46:41\n\" a DCL hatrick\"\nThe first... a thunderbolt from well outside the box.\nThe second... a mazy run which takes out three defenders and ends with an unerring finish into the top corner from an acute angle.\nAnd the third, a one on... naw nothing to fear here.\n14 Posted 13/08/2025 at 11:52:42\n15 Posted 13/08/2025 at 11:55:12\n16 Posted 13/08/2025 at 11:57:43\n17 Posted 13/08/2025 at 12:00:54\n18 Posted 13/08/2025 at 12:03:34\nGot me thinking of USM and Usmanov.\n19 Posted 13/08/2025 at 12:06:29\nNow relegation favourites beckon. And maybe even second or even third choice. Wonder if he's on more than a year contract. Fan forums are worried about biscuit like tendency and about getting a 'new Bamford'.\n20 Posted 13/08/2025 at 12:08:00\nPleased that Calvert-Lewin has found a club. Injury free, maybe now, and injury free, he can get his head back on football. I'm sure he will get a decent reception when he returns to Everton.\nNot quite meeting his criteria of wanting to play for a team challenging for Champions League, but at least he'll be back to playing football.\n21 Posted 13/08/2025 at 12:11:11\nLike others, I was expecting him to be picked up by Newcastle Utd or Man Utd as a back-up striker or go abroad tbh, to join a team playing in Europe. Yes, he's a Yorkshire lad but to go to Leeds and fight relegation for a season – I thought he was looking for a change, ha ha ha!!!\nWish him well as I was a fan of his but no wonder he sacked his agent as he's royally cocked up this move.\n22 Posted 13/08/2025 at 12:15:58\n23 Posted 13/08/2025 at 12:27:45\n24 Posted 13/08/2025 at 12:29:47\nDon't like his attitude to Everton tbh.\n25 Posted 13/08/2025 at 12:36:56\nThis is one reason why there were lots of dry eyes in the McNulty household once DCL decided to move on.\nI wonder how easily he will pass his medical? If he does play against us and is involved in a one-on-one, a star will rise in the East if he scores.\n26 Posted 13/08/2025 at 12:46:29\nHave they still got that other injured all the time striker to go with their new injured all the time striker? Bamford wasn't it?\n27 Posted 13/08/2025 at 12:57:03\n28 Posted 13/08/2025 at 12:58:42\n29 Posted 13/08/2025 at 13:06:23\n30 Posted 13/08/2025 at 13:10:33\n31 Posted 13/08/2025 at 13:17:04\n32 Posted 13/08/2025 at 13:23:09\nWhat do they know?\nHope DCL proves everyone wrong.\n33 Posted 13/08/2025 at 13:52:53\nI wish him well and hope he continues to operate in the premier league, I don’t care if he scores against us next Monday as long as we win.\n34 Posted 13/08/2025 at 14:01:18\nI also understood why he would want a change given the crap football that he got to 'spearhead' for so long.\nI was convinced he must have had an overseas deal tied up when he announced his departure. As it is, he's taken a backward step at a time when Everton have added the creative players he must have craved when he was in blue.\nJust odd. But good luck to him, after Monday.\n35 Posted 13/08/2025 at 14:16:37\n36 Posted 13/08/2025 at 14:25:09\n37 Posted 13/08/2025 at 14:31:35\n38 Posted 13/08/2025 at 14:34:45\nHe won't be fit enough to do 90 minutes….\n39 Posted 13/08/2025 at 15:05:01\n40 Posted 13/08/2025 at 15:10:19\nThe money can't be that much that it would make a difference to him, surely.\nWish he had stayed and I hope he does well, but not against us.\nChristy, I'm thinking he's saying, why the fk didn't I stay at Everton.\n41 Posted 13/08/2025 at 15:13:22\n42 Posted 13/08/2025 at 15:16:21\n43 Posted 13/08/2025 at 15:23:41\n44 Posted 13/08/2025 at 15:26:06\n45 Posted 13/08/2025 at 15:33:54\n1-2 to the Mighty Blues. Grealish to score the winner!\n46 Posted 13/08/2025 at 15:40:23\nHe did however play in a very dour Everton side ( struggling against relegation)in the last couple of years.\nAlso injury concerns didn’t help.\n47 Posted 13/08/2025 at 15:55:32\n48 Posted 13/08/2025 at 16:37:30\nHe's also been referred to as 'ACL' instead of 'DCL' which is pretty funny really.\nIt seems the view of him from the outside is one of gentle derision.\nLeeds fans are not happy.\n49 Posted 13/08/2025 at 16:41:40\nAs to the 130k wages I assume that’s why he sacked his agent cause apparently they baulked at his demands last month. Presumably he went back and asked for a more reasonable sum. I think his agent filled his head with nonsense given his comments about leaving Everton for champions league and trophy. That ship sailed after the Ancelotti season.\nI doubt he will play Monday as he’s had no pre season. Grealish at least was still employed by a club so training as normal if not featuring in pre season matches. Presumably it will need a few u21 or behind closed door games to get DCL match fit.\n50 Posted 13/08/2025 at 16:44:32\nHats off to them, they're really going for it, they've stolen our Crown Jewels… but I wish them all the luck in the world.\n51 Posted 13/08/2025 at 16:46:18\nI feel a bit sorry for Harrison Leeds fan hate him cause of that video of his Mum saying she hopes he doesn’t go back to Leeds. No fault of his. He seems like a decent pro he’s just not that good. I don’t think he’s a villain deserving of booing in the Maupay mold.\n52 Posted 13/08/2025 at 16:46:21\n53 Posted 13/08/2025 at 16:49:42\nIt must have been soul destroying for him (It was for me, just watching).\nWhen Moyes came in and pushed the full backs up, allowing the midfield to support the striker, for two games he looked a different player. Then got the injury that left us with a team playing to his strengths, but with Beto in his place.\nIf his new club allow players to support the centre forward, he will thrive once he is fully fit.\nHe always gave everything he could for the club. And as others have said, from next Tuesday on, I wish him well.\n54 Posted 13/08/2025 at 16:49:50\n55 Posted 13/08/2025 at 17:01:32\nI can never forgive Dominic turning his nose up at a new contract after being nurtured for 3 years and hardly playing a game for us.\n56 Posted 13/08/2025 at 17:06:46\nThe only difference being they think the similarity is they're both shite.\n57 Posted 13/08/2025 at 17:40:45\nHe must surely be regretting leaving us now?\n58 Posted 13/08/2025 at 18:06:49\n59 Posted 13/08/2025 at 19:40:48\n60 Posted 13/08/2025 at 21:43:50\nChances of DCL scoring against us may have just improved slightly.\n61 Posted 13/08/2025 at 22:32:21\n62 Posted 13/08/2025 at 22:32:56\nNever ever said a bad word about Everton, and he definitely could have the way he was treated by some fans.\n63 Posted 13/08/2025 at 22:36:27\n64 Posted 13/08/2025 at 22:42:15\n65 Posted 14/08/2025 at 03:15:38\nWhen he left I assumed he must have had a club lined up.\nBut it does it now look like he wanted out of Everton regardless of where he might end up? Maybe the treatment of him did have an effect.\n66 Posted 14/08/2025 at 05:04:06\nWe'll never know, of course.\nBest of luck to him. He always gave us his best.\n67 Posted 14/08/2025 at 06:52:05\nI recall we offered to extend his contract so we must have wanted to keep him, but not at £130k.\n68 Posted 14/08/2025 at 06:57:14\n69 Posted 14/08/2025 at 07:21:12\nNo wonder his legs went. His only role, in his latter years at Everton, was to try and out jump two giant centre-halves after a long punt upfield by Pickford.\nAll the best, Dom. And wear whatever the fuck you want to in the future.\n70 Posted 14/08/2025 at 07:30:01\nObviously we don't know the ins and outs of the deal on offer but surely he could have earned similarly with us whilst playing better football in a new stadium? I imagine his ego will have taken a dent that nobody in the Champions League wanted him, not even in Turkey! Regardless I wish him well.\n71 Posted 14/08/2025 at 08:05:24\nBut the most telling point is that he sacked his agent. I believe Dom, like most players, put his trust in his agent who clearly had no idea of the value of an injury prone striker. I think he was more interested in his own bank balance than his clients career.\nWhatever, I wish him and his family well\nfor the future and hope he can enjoy the rest of his playing days and his life in good health.\n72 Posted 14/08/2025 at 08:44:16\nHe only seemed to go flat out for 2 games a season, the rs and Arsenal.\nNow he's moved it'll be 3 a season, with us being the third.\nHe's sacked his agent and got a good deal cash wise.\nHe can go 110% balls out Vs us and then get to know the new physios better while his dosh mounts up in the bank.\nIf he only has 1 blinder in a season, we all know who it will be against.\nIf he does that and never kicks a ball for Leeds ( dirty dirty leeds) he might count that as a job well done in the revenge stakes.\nGot to be worth a tenner for first scorer.\n73 Posted 14/08/2025 at 09:00:49\nI bet he's signed a shorter deal and less wages than our offer, with a club that will be in a relegation dogfight.\n74 Posted 14/08/2025 at 09:08:15\n75 Posted 14/08/2025 at 09:14:15\nMy niece is a sports physio and her view is that some bodies simply can't cope with the pressures put on them by elite sport. Could be due to a number of reasons, physiological, genetic, body shape etc.\nHope Branthwaite isn't one.\n76 Posted 14/08/2025 at 11:55:29\nHe will play some part in Monday's game and will probably score. You all know how it goes with strikers who haven't scored against us and he hasn't ever. 😂\n77 Posted 14/08/2025 at 14:28:01\nPerhaps he has gone for first team football opportunities with a club close to family.\nI assumed he'd get a move to a better placed club (home or abroad) where he would be one of a few forward options from the bench. Suits his standard and injury record. Wonder what his other offers were.\nAt Leeds, I think there is a good chance he will be reunited with Dyche this season - with the current manager sacked by the January window for shipping too many goals.\nShame in a way because he could have done well under Moyes alongside better players as we rebuild the squad. But I think both parties probably needed a ch a change.\n78 Posted 14/08/2025 at 20:16:37\n79 Posted 14/08/2025 at 22:33:18\nI’m pretty sure Koeman played him right back on one occasion, didn’t he?\n80 Posted 15/08/2025 at 10:55:51\nHe always thought he was better that he was. Will have a look on the Leeds forum in a few weeks time.\n81 Posted 15/08/2025 at 11:04:32\n82 Posted 15/08/2025 at 12:52:31\n83 Posted 15/08/2025 at 12:57:18\nGet on the No Red Shite Here league, much better.\n84 Posted 15/08/2025 at 14:48:03\n85 Posted 15/08/2025 at 15:18:12\n86 Posted 15/08/2025 at 15:49:06\nHeld Everton to ransom, thought he could do even better and ends up at Leeds earning less.\n87 Posted 15/08/2025 at 15:53:32\n88 Posted 15/08/2025 at 15:59:11\n89 Posted 15/08/2025 at 16:17:51\nHe must feel like a right pillock.\n90 Posted 15/08/2025 at 17:45:41\nAlso seems to have been primarily about wages and greed too. Good riddance.\n91 Posted 15/08/2025 at 18:53:30\nListening to Moyes today, he was looking for massive wages, and I agree he's definitely on less money than we offered, and Leeds were never in his plans. Beggars can't be choosers, sadly.\n92 Posted 15/08/2025 at 18:59:39\nHe certainly put them on the table over DCL, despite his kind eulogy he wanted to bleed the club, I wish him well but glad he has gone. Good luck with Leeds??\nBeto got a huge defensive thumbs up and support from the Manager, who respects his hard work and willing to learn. Beto will score a lot of goals this will really be his breakout season.\nI don't think it will be long before that right side is sorted, plus a number 6 brought in.\n93 Posted 15/08/2025 at 21:00:16\nWill be a tough game there Monday. If we had our full defence I'd be relaxed. The thought of Keane in a bouncing Elland Rd scares me.\nIs Myko fit? Are we looking at 3 centre-backs? McNeil and Garner as wingbacks?\nGet £100M player for next to nothing and still we are looking at crisis mode before a ball been kicked. Wouldn't be Everton if we weren't fighting something or someone.\n94 Posted 15/08/2025 at 22:48:39\nWhether you agree or not, he might believe he was played up front in some dreadfully defensive teams, mismanaged by the medical team, rushed back into the side repeatedly, taunted by fans for his fashion choices, had his mental health publicly questioned by his manager, and had his wife abused by online trolls.\nMaybe he just wanted to get out. I wouldn't have believed it because he never said anything but good things about Everton and Evertonians, but leaving without a deal agreed elsewhere does smack of a guy being prepared to take his chances rather than stay.\nThe glee from some fans in him struggling for a team and then turning up at a newly promoted team isn't a good look, in my opinion. And shows a lack of any kind of collective self reflection.\nHe's made the decision to move on and show some class in his words, and a portion of our fans would be well advised to do the same.\n95 Posted 15/08/2025 at 23:01:21\nErnie I didn't say DCL shouldn't have left, souldnt have run his contract down, shouldn't have carried s handbag or worn a skirt.\nI said he had been badly advised.\nIn my opinion, he's gone from us an established PL club( one fighting relagation year on year)\nTo Leeds ( one yo yoing year on year )\nFair enough if you feel your time is done and move on.\nTo be without a Club at his stage of his career was a bit strange.\nEverton, by Moyes statement wanted him to stay.\nI always liked him, tried hid best, put his body on the line, gsve his all, in some terrible teams and times.\nBut he was no isakk, he was no haaland.\nHe could potentially have had his best season here with the signings we've made.\nGood luck to the lad. Just not Monday!\n96 Posted 15/08/2025 at 23:07:47\n97 Posted 15/08/2025 at 23:08:13\nWe don't necessarily know the full story - hence the glee from some isn't a good look. And there is another thread on here that is full of glee.\n98 Posted 15/08/2025 at 23:29:54\nFiring one's agent in the middle of a transfer window is highly unusual.\n99 Posted 15/08/2025 at 23:38:05\nI think some blues would love to believe he sacked his agent while saying through tears... you made me leave the club I loved, we should have taken the lower wage, you said I was too good for Everton.\nIt could be true, but it's probably just a bit comfortable for Evertonians to believe. Big life decisions tend to be a bit more nuanced.\n100 Posted 16/08/2025 at 00:14:16\n101 Posted 16/08/2025 at 02:19:48\nWhat we do know is what you reminded us on, abuse of his wife, derision of his choices outside football, and abuse on the pitch playing as a lone attacker for Sean Dyche. Let me say that again, a lone attacker for Sean Dyche. The man who was sacked because of his inability to get the best out of the players we had. David Moyes proved that.\nFor years he has been the only striker we have had and scored some beauts. His injury record in the past few season is not great, but again, the pressure on him to return as the only forward was immense. It didn't help, and probably contributed.\nHe is gone. It's the best thing for him and us, but he served us well. The stats might say one thing but they do not show the quality of the manager he was playing for, or the players around him that were supposed to provide chances.\nThe striker's life is a game of averages, get three chances, score one. We were lucky to get single chances in most games under Dyche. Remember that?\n102 Posted 16/08/2025 at 04:03:56\nYou can’t blame Dyche for the pitiful attempts one one-on-one. A striker being paid over £100k a week.\nYou can’t blame Dyche for his failings. He’s shite in front of goal, sorry.\n103 Posted 16/08/2025 at 05:47:15\n104 Posted 16/08/2025 at 06:26:59\nI personally believe he never recovered from the boos he got when he fractured his cheekbone. No real coming back from that and you are right Ernie, we are the ones who should be reflecting on that. We have some of the best support in the land but I'd love for us to find a way to stop turning on our own sometimes.\nI am rooting for Dom to do well (just not against us, though I wouldn't be surprised if he was a real handful Monday night!) and yes I imagine he is not where he'd hoped he be but had to leave.\n105 Posted 16/08/2025 at 07:30:51\nHe had run his contract down, was made an offer to stay, but the club and player couldn't agree.\nHe did spend a lot of his time at Everton playing as an isolated and frustrated Everton striker. He won't have enjoyed that much. Probably his only consistently productive run was under Ancelotti.\nAs for the fashion display, I found that irrelevant to the debate about him as a footballer. There may have been mutterings around Old Trafford when Beckham embarked on his fashion career, but they were supportive of the footballer.\nInjuries are injuries and they happen. I often think due to the nature of our paper thin squad, the way he was asked to play and his style of play, he was run into the ground from a young age, which may have contributed.\nThen a few tipping points.\nBooed by a few of his own supporters for having to go off at Villa Park with a facial injury after a collision with their goalkeeper.\nAnd what happened to his wife. The internet is a tool that provides information at our fingertips, brings people together and keeps people in touch. Unfortunately some \"brave\" keyboard warriors use it to hurl abuse. Fortunately, as the couple joined the squad on the lap of appreciation at the last Goodison fixture, they got a warm reception and both applauded the supporters back.\nFinally, maybe it was just time to go. £1.5m, and gave us the best part of 10 years. He's not our player any more. He never hit the heights of expectation, but neither did the Everton teams he played in.\n106 Posted 16/08/2025 at 08:59:35\n107 Posted 16/08/2025 at 09:12:30\nI just thought that Dom was completely delusional.\n108 Posted 16/08/2025 at 09:20:12\nDCL's agent appeared to have an inflated sense of his worth. DCL himself appeared to be somewhat delusional about where his career was and is after all the injuries and struggles in front of goal, before reality came knocking.\n109 Posted 16/08/2025 at 09:35:30\n110 Posted 16/08/2025 at 10:29:53\nAgree with your last sentence.\nDcls header v Palace & header v lpool will live long in the memory.\nI wish he stays fit and enjoys the rest of his career, just not too much when he plays against us!\nThe one thing we do need to act upon as a club is identifying which players are running their contracts down and get shut off them for a fee. We have lost a fortune on them.\n111 Posted 16/08/2025 at 18:29:33\nCalvert-Lewin is apparently on £80,000 a week, the poor lad should have stayed with us, don't know how he'll manage on that.\n112 Posted 16/08/2025 at 18:46:34\nThe Newcastle links probably swayed his thinking; ironically, the Barcodes don't have a single centre-forward in their squad now.\nTiming is so key in these situations. They are probably thinking he would have been a good squad player now.\nI feel Dom and Everton missed the real peak of his attraction to other teams before he had his long injury. Everton missed the opportunity to cash in!\nLeeds could be good for him. For most teams, success is judged totally differently. Scoring 10 and Leeds staying up, they would probably love him, 10 for us and we would be looking at his wages thinking \"Is that value?\"\nIs he getting more wages at Leeds? Who knows?\nI think Barry will contribute more goals this season, Beto was better last season, so I'm not worried we will miss him. He will miss Everton more!\nHe should be welcome back after he's finished playing. He's not a legend, but he's part of some real amazing memories of this club!\n113 Posted 17/08/2025 at 15:29:18\n114 Posted 17/08/2025 at 15:56:09\nOver the years I’ve had my pet hates (nothing personal) eg Iwobi, Pembridge, John McGlaughlin, Bryan Hamilton etc… Simply because they were all shite.\nDCL played out of position. Played up top on his own. Received no service at all. Never had any support etc… I loved the lad for the effort he put in in every game. He never hid. He never shirked. He never disrespected the club but for some he’s the devil incarnate.\nI wish him nothing but the best.\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
