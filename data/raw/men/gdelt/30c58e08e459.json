  "body_text": "Liverpool are reportedly interested in signing the PSG attacker Bradley Barcola, but they will have to pay a substantial amount of money.\nAccording to TBR Football, Liverpool are long-term admirers of the French attacker, but he will cost over £100 million. Even though he was not a regular starter for PSG last season, he was outstanding for them, and he registered 42 goal contributions in all competitions.\nGraeme Bailey said: “There is some interest from Liverpool. They are one of the sides who have a long-standing interest.\n“Intermediaries have been busy, checking on potential clubs he could join. Much would depend, like Rodrygo, on the player pushing. Liverpool won’t just bid for no reason. If they think the player wants to move they may look to do a deal.\n“As it stands PSG are strong in their stance – Barcola is not for sale and it would take crazy money to get him. £100m plus. However, if the player pushes, I am told it could become interesting. But PSG insist they have heard nothing.”\nBradley Barcola would improve the Reds\nHe helped PSG win the league title and the UEFA Champions League. There is no doubt that he is a world-class talent with a bright future, and he could be an exceptional acquisition for Liverpool. Luis Diaz has left the club, and they need to bring in another wide player. Darwin Nunez is closing in on a move to Saudi Arabia as well, and Federico Chiesa could be sold this summer.\nAnother attacker would be ideal, and Barcola certainly fits the profile. He is one of the best young attacking players in European football right now, and the 22-year-old would be an asset for Liverpool. It will be interesting to see if they can afford him.\nCan Liverpool afford Barcola?\nThey have already spent substantial amounts of money this summer, and they are interested in the Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak as well. The Swedish International is likely to cost a British transfer record fee. It is fair to assume that they will not be able to afford the French attacker if they sign Isak. It will be interesting to see if they decide to make a move for the PSG attacker if they miss out on the Newcastle star.\nBarcola is capable of operating on either flank, and he will add some much-needed unpredictability to the Liverpool attack.",
