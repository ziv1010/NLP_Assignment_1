The other thing is that when these other teams have good players, they are bought by these big teams…The next thing you hear they are at [Mighty] Wanderers or at Bullets.”\nOn the team’s performance at the regional showpiece, the former Dynamos FC and Zimbabwe National Football Team coach said despite failing to register a win and scoring, the team did well.\nPasuwa said his focus is building a team that can qualify for 2027 Africa Cup of Nations.\nHe said: “So, in building up a team, you, at times go into risk mode, where you need to see each and every player.\n“We went [there] to compete, unfortunately, we didn’t win a game or even score a goal.\n“But remember, we said we are trying to build a team [and] I can now easily say that I have players who can be part of the squad and those are some of the positives.”\nPasuwa also claimed that there were some fellow coaches who were impressed with the Flames’ performance and even thought that some of them play in Europe.\n“We had some coaches, especially from Angola, asking how many of our players play in Europe, but we only had locally-based players. So, [these were some of the positives in terms of how these boys faired. It’s only that we didn’t get goals,”\nOn dropping some key local-based players for the tournament such as Alick Lungu, Lloyd Aaron and Nickson Mwase. the coach said: “We need to bear mind that we need youngsters for the future.\n“And I thought maybe we had most of them [experienced players] in the Chan [African Nations Championship] squad, who played well, very positive in terms of playing structured football.\n“People should understand that Lungu and Aaron were already spotted and these are among our regulars.”\nHowever, football analyst George Chiusiwa, posting on his Facebook page said: “The indefinite, never-ending and continuous ‘we are building a new team’ song is now sickening and we are tired of petty excuses when the team falters. It’s crazy!\n“Today, it is strange and laughable to hear the coach and FAM telling the nation that we have started ‘building a new team’ again. Until when will we lament like this? We can do better.\n“Let us be honest for Malawi to meaningfully and genuinely transform and reorganise the game. Otherwise, we will continue groping in the dark.\n“By the way, the football gods cannot smile at the Flames if we continue cheating ourselves and living in denial. We need to change our mindset and face the reality of our football in this country.”\nAt the Cosafa tournament, Malawi lost to Lesotho’s Likuaena and Angola’s Palancas Negras by 1-0 margins and drew against Namibia’s Brave Warriors 0-0 to anchor Group B.",
