  "body_text": "Tottenham Hotspur sporting director (singular, as I assume Fabio Paratici has already left the club) Johan Lange has a new video and an interview out on the club’s website that dissects the now-finished January transfer window. I’ve read through the interview, and quite frankly, if you were to design in a lab the most anodyne and bland public response to a disappointing transfer window, you’d probably get this one from Johan Lange.\nJohan Lange dissects Tottenham’s transfer window, says nothing\nJohan Lange speaks without saying anything, really.\nIt’s a general assumption by Spurs fans that this window was disappointing. Tottenham brought in two players — Conor Gallagher to enhance central midfield, and Souza, a promising but unproven left back from Santos in Brazil. Spurs were linked to any number of players, offensive and defensive, but weren’t able to get them in over the line before the window slammed shut.\nIn my piece yesterday, I acknowledged the reality that a) January windows are a terrible time to do actual business, and b) this was a historically quiet January window even by those standards. These are objective truths. So it shouldn’t surprise anyone to see Lange bring those two points up as background to his dissection of Spurs’ transfer business. Lange also noted that teams were less likely to want to sell or do business in the mid-season window due to the new European football group stage format stretching into January, as well as the impact of injuries within football squads, including (but not limited to) Tottenham’s.\n“Yes, firstly, this is always an issue I enjoy doing because I think this gives me and us a great opportunity to communicate directly with the fans around the transfer periods. I saw this window here as one of the quieter January windows across not only the Premier League, but across football in general. I think there were, including free transfers, 33 transfers across the Premier League. That is a result of especially the new format in Europe. Now we have clubs competing in either Champions League or Europa League during December and of course during the last part of January as well - 48 teams progressing further in the European competitions after the window. I think we saw that a little bit last year and I think we saw even more this year that have changed the dynamic a little bit of the January transfer window, with just less business is being done. Of course, a knock-on effect of the increased fixture schedule is also that not only us, but a number of clubs would say that they have too many injuries. That meant that there were simply not many available players across the whole marketplace during January.\n“When we go into January, we didn’t anticipate that we’ll have seven injuries during the month of January. So, that of course changes things during the course of the window. It’s very important, even though that is highly frustrating with all the injuries, to remain disciplined because, A, the players are coming back and, B, if you then, can you say, go in and make a stress purchase of any football players, then yes, the immediate feeling gives you is nice, but there’s no point in signing players that have not helped us in the short term, in the medium term, or even in the long term. So, even though that is highly frustrating with all the injuries, the majority of the players will return this season here, hopefully a few very soon. It is important as a club to remain disciplined and make sure to do our best, our ability only to sign players that can generally help the team now or in the future.”\nSo Lange’s not wrong about this, but the implications are significant. It suggests that one of the reasons Spurs didn’t pull the trigger on some of their proposed moves last month was because they are anticipating that injured players will return to the squad. That’s not the most helpful or encouraging thing for fans, especially with Spurs 14th in the table and with a squad that resembles the walking dead. But it is at least a reasonable rationale, whether or not you agree with it.\nThere’s also some message discipline at play here — Frank, when asked in press conferences about adding to the squad, was clear that the club’s direction was towards making sure any signings coming in would be part of the overall plan for the season, and that the club would be hesitant to “panic buy.” In this interview, Lange sticks to the club line.\n“We were very clear before the window that if there were players available that we were able to sign in this window that could help the team now, but of course also in the future, then we were ready to go. But when during the window you can see that some doors remain open, like, for instance, with Conor, some other doors close, then it’s very important that you don’t, can you say, force yourself in to make a stress purchases, because that normally doesn’t end well for anyone.”\nLange also looks towards the future and hints at what could be significant changes in the summer window.\n“The summer market is where eight or nine out of 10 players, they move clubs, so we will go into the summer window with big ambitions of strengthening the team. We know there’ll be more movements, we know there’ll be more opportunities, so the plans are already, can you see, drawn up. We have a clear picture of which position and also which profiles. Could we have brought one or two more in this January window? We would have been delighted to do so. but that was not a possibility. So, we are looking forward to the summer, now we focus on the rest of the season and that is very, very important as well because we have big objectives. We’re still in the Champions League. We want to, of course, be higher in the Premier League and then myself and others will have our eyes already now directed towards the summer transfer window.”\nThe irony is that, while not really saying anything, this is pretty much the kind of statement you’d expect from a competent Director of Football, even if things were going well. I would argue, and have, that things are NOT going especially well, but I can appreciate the message discipline. These are not statements that are going to appease a fan base that’s jittery about the slim but concrete possibility of relegation and that is already mostly over Thomas Frank as head coach. It kicks the can forward, but doesn’t really offer much for us to sink our teeth into. That’s almost certainly by design.\nI’ve stated, and I hold to this, that Lange has not shown sufficient competence in his job at Spurs thus far to keep his job. This interview is anodyne and corporate. It doesn’t rock the boat in any one direction, maintains that there is a plan (even if we plebeians can’t see or understand it), and is almost certainly exactly the kind of interview he should’ve given, no matter the circumstances. It’s a nothing interview about what is more or less a nothing transfer window. Makes sense!\nBut he should still be fired, because he’s lost the confidence of the fan base that he can engineer a turnaround.",
