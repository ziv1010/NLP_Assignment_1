  "body_text": "The Premier League title race continues to thrill after some massive results this week, with a defeat for Liverpool seemingly all but extinguishing their hopes.\nJurgen Klopp’s side were soundly beaten 2-0 by Merseyside rivals Everton at Goodison Park on Wednesday night, with the departing manager saying afterwards that his side are now relying on crises at Arsenal and Manchester City.\nThat does not look likely, though, with the Gunners bouncing back from their Champions League exit against Bayern Munich to record back-to-back wins against Wolves and Chelsea – hammering the latter 5-0.\nCity, meanwhile, travelled to the south coast to face Brighton on Thursday evening and were three goals up after barely half-an-hour, seeing out the contest 4-0 to lay down a statement victory.\nAlthough Pep Guardiola’s side are still in second place, they have a game in hand on Arsenal – and a kinder fixture list – with some huge matches on the horizon that could decide the destination of the title…\nARSENAL\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nCurrent position: 1st | Points: 77 | Goal difference: +56\nArsenal's remaining matches\nApril 28 – Tottenham (away) – PL\nMay 4 – Bournemouth (home) – PL\nMay 12 – Manchester United (away) – PL\nMay 19 – Everton (home) – PL\nIt briefly looked as though Arsenal’s season might be on the verge of implosion after back-to-back losses against Aston Villa and Bayern Munich, but six points in the space of four days has changed the mood dramatically.\nFrom being entirely written off in the title race by many, the Gunners will be top until Sunday at least when they travel up Seven Sisters Road to take on north London rivals Tottenham, who will be itching to do what Everton did to Liverpool on Wednesday night.\nThere are still other challenges awaiting Arsenal on the home straight, with Bournemouth’s high-pressing outfit certainly capable of springing an upset, while an away trip to Old Trafford to face a Manchester United side in need of points represents a huge test despite how leaky Erik ten Hag’s side have been defensively.\nBiggest game remaining: The north London derby\nUndoubtedly the most eye-catching game left for Arsenal is a trip to face north London rivals Tottenham on Sunday. Last season’s 2-0 win for the Gunners was their only victory in their last nine Premier League visits to N17, while Spurs have a strong record against the top six this season. They have also had two weeks’ rest before the game.\nWhat the pundits are saying:\n‘There just seems to be an air of confidence, steeliness, I think there’s been a learning from last year. Mikel Arteta’s composure in the week before this, where they lost against Aston Villa and they lost against Bayern Munich going out of Champions League.\n‘You wouldn’t be up in arms if the wheels had fallen off, you would kind of expect that, but the way he’s gained composure himself, but also his team on the pitch, has been something for me, a new-found respect for him at this stage.\n‘Yes, they’ve still got a lot of work to do, and they still have to get over the line and win the league, but just even that little area, I think, is a big shift from last season.’ — Rio Ferdinand on TNT Sports\nMANCHESTER CITY\nCurrent position: 2nd | Points: 76 | Goal difference: +48\nMan City's remaining matches\nApril 28 – Nottingham Forest (away) – PL\nMay 4 – Wolves (home) – PL\nMay 11 – Fulham (away) – PL\nMay 14 – Tottenham (away) – PL\nMay 19 – West Ham (home) – PL\nAfter falling four points and two games behind Arsenal due to their FA Cup participation, City needed to lay down a marker and did exactly that with a dominant performance away to Brighton – a fixture which, on paper at least, looked like it would be a bigger test.\nGuardiola’s side now face three bottom-half clubs in a row with only Sunday’s opponents Nottingham Forest having something to fight for. With no European football to contend with, it is hard to look past City even without the injured Erling Haaland.\nWolves have caused the top sides plenty of problems this season but are still missing a number of important players and actually have the sixth-highest Expected Goals conceded in the division. Fulham are one place below them while West Ham rank third (second away from home) and City will surely have too much firepower.\nBiggest game remaining: Tottenham away\nFor all three sides, fifth-placed Tottenham are probably the most challenging team they have left to face. That is particularly true of City, with Spurs something of a bogey team. They may have won in north London in the FA Cup earlier this year, but Guardiola’s side had never previously even scored a goal at the stadium. Then again, how motivated will Tottenham be to aid Arsenal’s title bid?\nWhat the pundits are saying:\n‘If you are there, five games to go, out of the Champions League, they will know how to rest and this game against Nottingham Forest, I will not say that it will be the same as tonight, but this team know how to deal with it.\n‘That’s why they are contenders. The [Opta supercomputer probability of 71%] doesn’t mean much, but the history and the past of what they’ve done over the last 10 years is the reason why they will deal with it. Because they know how to do this. Champions know.’ — Gael Clichy on Sky Sports\nLIVERPOOL\nCurrent position: 3rd | Points: 74 | Goal difference: +41\nLiverpool's remaining matches\nApril 27 – West Ham (away) – PL\nMay 5 – Tottenham (home) – PL\nMay 13 – Aston Villa (away) – PL\nMay 19 – Wolves (home) – PL\nMany pundits felt Liverpool actually had the easiest run-in of the three challengers but defeats against Crystal Palace and Everton – 14th and 16th in the table respectively – has severely damaged their title hopes and even got Jurgen Klopp looking over his shoulder.\nSuddenly the Merseysiders are talking about consolidating their position in the top four despite being 14 points ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham, though there is a fear their season could fizzle out with some testing matches ahead.\nThe visit of Spurs at the start of next month has now become a must-win game, while an away trip to face fourth-placed Aston Villa a week later is even more difficult. If Wolves get their key players fit enough for the season finale, they too could prove to be a very challenging opponent – particularly when you factor in their strong record against the big six.\nBiggest game remaining: West Ham away\nMore Trending\nFacing a team that lost 5-2 last time out might not seem like a huge test but make no mistake, if Liverpool do not win in east London their title hopes are firmly over. The early kick-off time – something Virgil van Dijk complained about straight after the Everton defeat – will be a factor, especially with West Ham enjoying a week off, and the Hammers are always capable of an upset. But Liverpool must find a way to bounce back.\nWhat the pundits are saying:\n‘This is the end of the title run for Liverpool. They just have to make sure they finish the season strongly. They had enough chances in the game but at the moment they are not clinical enough in both boxes.\n‘I don’t think you can get too angry with the team or Jurgen Klopp. It’s been a great ride and a great journey. But tonight is Everton’s night and you have to take it on the chin.’ — Jamie Carragher on Sky Sports\nWho will win the Premier League title?\n-\nArsenal\n-\nManchester City\n-\nLiverpool\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Chelsea issue injury update on Enzo Fernandez after groin surgery\nMORE: Real Sociedad star Martin Zubimendi responds to Arsenal transfer link\nMORE: Arne Slot confirms Liverpool talks and speaks out on replacing Jurgen Klopp",
