  "body_text": "Arsenal have been told they should have approached Liverpool to discussa surprise deal for Darwin Nunez during the January transfer window.\nMikel Arteta was keen for Arsenal to strengthen his attacking options in January after losing Gabriel Jesus to a season-ending injury at the start of the month.\nThe Gunners were linked with moves for Dusan Vlahovic, Benjamin Sesko, Alexander Isak and Victor Osimhen before making an official offer for England striker Ollie Watkins.\nAston Villa rejected Arsenal’s bid and the north London club decided to keep their powder dry in the final few days of the window.\nThat decision almost immediately looked regrettable, however, as just two weeks after the window closed first-choice Arsenal striker Kai Havertz suffered a hamstring injury that is expected to rule him out for the rest of the season.\nArteta now faces a huge period of Premier League and Champions League football with just Leandro Trossard, Raheem Sterling and teenager Ethan Nwaneri as the recognised forwards in his squad.\nDietmar Hamann insists Arsenal’s depleted attacking options will ‘harm their chances’ of securing silverware this season and says the Gunners should have made a surprise move for Liverpool forward Nunez.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nLiverpool signed Nunez from Benfica in 2022 for an initial £64m but the Uruguayan has underwhelmed at Anfield, scoring 39 goals in 130 appearances.\nHe has, however, popped up with some important contributions and Hamann believes he would have been a ‘brilliant addition’ to Arsenal’s squad.\n‘Obviously, this is an unfortunate situation for Arsenal because Kai Havertz hasn’t had too many injuries since he came to the club,’ the former Champions League winner told Prime Casino.\n‘I said that before, I don’t see them winning the Premier League or the Champions League unless they sign a centre-forward like Ollie Watkins.\n‘I don’t know how serious that was, but [Jhon] Duran went to Saudi, so I think it was always unlikely they’re gonna let Watkins go, still being in the Champions League.\n‘I think the team is well equipped, but the lack of a centre forward is obviously what I think harms their chances.\n‘The only real question mark I have about Arsenal’s squad is the centre forward position. And I think even Darwin Nunez, I think Nunez would be gold for Arsenal.\n‘Because I think if you’ve got somebody up top who bullies defenders, who draws defenders in, he always gets the attention of two or three defenders.\n‘Obviously, he’s a big unit. He’s quick. The game changes. If you’ve got somebody up top with a physical presence, with pace, it’s a different ball game.\nMore Trending\n‘They always find space, Arsenal, but it also makes it easier for the likes of Saka and Martinelli and Odegaard when they get into these pockets because quick players stretch teams. They simply haven’t got it.\n‘I think even a Nunez would be a brilliant addition to the squad, but it’s too late for that now and they have to make do with what they have.’\nNunez was linked with a move away from Anfield in January, with Saudi clubs interested in a deal, but Liverpool blocked his exit ahead of a demanding and vital final few months of the season.\nArne Slot’s side are seven points clear of Arsenal at the top of the Premier League and favourites to win the Champions League after finishing the group phase with a near-perfect record.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Phil Jones tips Manchester United’s new academy ‘animal’ to help Ruben Amorim\nMORE: Jamie O’Hara says Man Utd star ‘looks like he hates football’ under Ruben Amorim\nMORE: Everton’s new Hill Dickinson Stadium: How much it cost, capacity and reason behind the name",
