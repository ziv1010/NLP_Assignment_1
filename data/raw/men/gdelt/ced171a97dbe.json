Moments after Alex Remiro's error almost handed Barcelona the lead, Elustondo was dismissed for his last-man foul on Dani Olmo as the attacking midfielder looked to race through on goal.\nThe Basque outfit's ten-man resistance lasted just eight minutes before the hosts celebrated their opener. Olmo, who was the decisive factor in last weekend's win over Las Palmas, found left-back Martin inside the penalty area and the 23-year-old emphatically swept home his first goal for the club.\nCasado would enjoy the same feeling just four minutes later as he opened his Barcelona account. Fortune favoured the holding midfielder as Olmo's venomous strike ricocheted off his knee and beyond the helpless Remiro.\nThe second half was all about damage limitation for La Real but they allowed Barcelona their third just ten minutes after the restart. Having just seen Pedri power a thumping strike off the crossbar, the visitors couldn't prevent Araujo turning home from close range at a corner.\nBuoyed by his effort several minutes earlier, the Uruguayan defender proceeded to set up Lewandowski as Barcelona poured more misery on their visitors. The Poland international stuck out a foot to divert his teammate's long-range effort beyond Remiro, claiming his eighth goal in the space of ten matches in the process.\nWith the points firmly in their back pocket, Barcelona understandably took their foot off the gas in the closing stages as they cast one eye towards Wednesday's Champions League clash with Benfica.\nPlayer ratings\nCheck out player ratings from Barcelona 4-0 Real Sociedad here.\nAdvantage Barcelona in La Liga title race\nHaving seen an underwhelming Madrid beaten in Seville on Saturday, Barcelona were well aware of what they needed to do against a stubborn Real Sociedad side who had only been narrowly defeated by Los Blancos in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday evening.\nImanol Alguacil's men don't concede many and are capable of frustrating even the most dynamic of opposition - something they proved in victory over Barcelona earlier this term - but an early red card made the victory far too comfortable.\nA potentially problematic encounter swiftly turned into a cakewalk for the home side, who are now in pole position for top spot come the end of the season.\nDani Olmo fuels Barcelona procession\nOlmo's position in the starting lineup has not been guaranteed since the turn of the year but the Spaniard proved his credentials to Flick on Sunday. Having changed the game from the bench last weekend, he proved the difference-maker from the off against La Real.\nThe 26-year-old was instrumental in the three key moments of the first half, winning the foul that saw Elustondo dismissed before setting up both strikes. His first assist was sumptuous as he demonstrated his remarkable vision to pick out Martin at the far post and his presence in the penalty area consistently unnerved Real Sociedad's defence.\nOlmo finished the encounter having created five chances, as well as completing 92% of his passes and taking ten touches in the Real Sociedad box. La Real simply couldn't handle him.\nPerfect preparation for the Champions League\nIt couldn't have been a much rosier afternoon for Barcelona in terms of their charge for the title, but it was also perfect preparation for their upcoming Champions League last-16 first leg against Benfica on Wednesday evening.\nHaving wrapped up victory by the half-time whistle, Hansi Flick was able to make several early substitutions in the second half to rest key first-teamers ahead of the trip to Lisbon, with the trio of Pedri, Raphinha and Pau Cubarsi all withdrawn before the hour mark.\nLa Blaugrana should have plenty of fresh legs ahead of their Portuguese adventure and they will prove pivotal in overcoming a talented Benfica side. Barcelona's visit to Estadio da Luz earlier this season ended 5-4 in controversial circumstances as Bruno Lage's side continually caused them issues with darting runs in behind and swift counter-attacks.\nKnockout football is often a matter of fine margins and Barcelona's effortless victory on Sunday may give them the extra energy needed in Europe.",
