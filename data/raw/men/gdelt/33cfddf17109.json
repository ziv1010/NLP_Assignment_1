  "body_text": "Real Madrid vs Barcelona: El Clasico combined XI\n- Real Madrid and Barcelona go head-to-head for the third time this season on Sunday\n- Carlo Ancelotti's side looking to take a huge stride to the Spanish title with victory\n- Both sides boast some of the most exciting talents in world football\nWhile Clasico clashes between Real Madrid and Barcelona may not be quite as star-studded as they once were, this fixture still sees some of the world's best duke it out.\nLocked in a rather one-sided title race in La Liga, Barcelona can reduce Madrid's lead at the top of the table to a slightly nervy five points should they triumph at the Santiago Bernabeu this weekend.\nHaving seen their rivals make it to the semi-finals of the Champions League midweek as they crumbled at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain, Clasico bragging rights would be much appreciated for Xavi's side.\nBut overcoming the table-toppers will be an almighty challenge for Barcelona given their recent woes in this fixture, including two defeats already this season. For all their talented stars, the Catalan club still don't quite have the same 'X factor' as their fierce foes.\nWith that in mind, here's the most complete XI that can be pieced together from those available.\nGK: Marc-Andre ter Stegen (Barcelona)\nThibaut Courtois' injury makes this a rather straightforward choice. No offence Andriy Lunin.\nBarcelona's Ter Stegen has always been a reliable pair of hands for the Catalan giants and has been a strong performer in spite of his side's defensive difficulties this term. He has often been asked to perform miracles as a result of a porous backline and he tends to oblige.\nRB: Dani Carvajal (Real Madrid)\nThe experienced Spaniard showed his reliability against Manchester City in the Champions League midweek and there is a reason that Real haven't rushed to replace the 32-year-old with a traditional 'superstar'.\nCarvajal continues to be the first-choice right-back under Carlo Ancelotti and has shown few signs of slowing down any time soon as he chases more glory in the capital.\nCB: Antonio Rudiger (Real Madrid)\nThe fierce centre-back would make the cut regardless of injuries, but the absence of his teammate David Alaba makes his inclusion even simpler. Rudiger is one of the world's best defenders and the kind of opponent that few strikers relish facing.\nHe kept Manchester City's Erling Haaland quiet over two legs in the Champions League and not many forwards can outdo him when it comes to physicality, pace or aggression.\nCB: Pau Cubarsi (Barcelona)\nThe 17-year-old's swift rise to the top has been pretty frightening and the fact that he has already muscled some of his teammates out of this team speaks volumes.\nCubarsi has shown his class and maturity during his breakout season in Catalonia and the teenager has never been fazed by the big occasion despite regularly being thrust into the spotlight.\nLB: Ferland Mendy (Real Madrid)\nBarcelona don't even come close in the left-back department, with Mendy head and shoulders above the options that the Catalan side possess.\nThe reliable Frenchman may not have the glamour of his predecessor Marcelo, but he has proved a steady provider for Real in a key area.\nCM: Federico Valverde (Real Madrid)\nEduardo Camavinga and Toni Kroos may feel hard done by - the latter still a world class operator at the age of 34 alongside long-time chum Luka Modric - but there's few better midfielders in world football right now than Fede Valverde.\nThe Uruguayan can do absolutely any job asked of him, and seemingly has a Duracell battery that would outdo any bunny put in front of him. If it's the sublime you're looking for, look no further than his magnificent volley against Manchester City in the Champions League.\nCM: Pedri (Barcelona)\nMidfield is arguably the toughest area of the pitch to decide between, with so many brilliant options for both sides. However, Pedri offers the perfect combination of relentless energy and classy playmaking.\nFrenkie de Jong ticks things over nicely for Barcelona but there's only one player whose future at the club is absolutely secure.\nCM: Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid)\nOne man who was guaranteed a spot in midfield is Madrid's shiniest new recruit. The summer signing has been astonishing since arriving from Borussia Dortmund and showcased his best qualities during the Clasico clash in La Liga earlier this season with two huge goals.\nBellingham can play as a number ten and has even proven himself as a centre-forward this season, with the youngster arguably the best midfielder on the planet at present.\nRW: Lamine Yamal (Barcelona)\nBarcelona's young talents have lit up a pretty bleak season so far and Yamal has shone brightest for Xavi's side. The 16-year-old continues to do simply astonishing things for someone who still can't legally drive himself to and from training.\nAn electric burst of speed and an eye for goal, Yamal has swiftly become Barcelona's most devastating attacking threat on that right flank.\nST: Vinicius Junior (Real Madrid)\nWhile Vinicius Junior still prefers to play from the left flank, he has proven himself as an effective attacking option through the middle under Ancelotti. The Brazilian's pace and sharp feet make him a handful for full-backs and centre-backs alike, with few players more entertaining in full flight.\nA hat-trick in the Supercopa de Espana final against Barcelona earlier this term was one of his best displays of the season, although there have been plenty to choose from.\nSorry Robert Lewandowski, you're out.\nLW: Rodrygo (Real Madrid)\nThere are few forwards more underappreciated than Rodrygo in world football and his usefulness is likely to rather harshly diminish upon Kylian Mbappe's arrival this summer. However, the Brazil star is still a sensational winger, who has often proved to be the difference-maker on the big occasion.\nBarcelona would certainly be keen to have someone of Rodrygo's pace and power in their front line and there are few who could deny him a place in this combined XI.",
