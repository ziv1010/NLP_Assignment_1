Saturday 11 February, 12:30 (GMT)\nWhere is the match being played? Academy Stadium\nTV channel/live stream? Sky Sports Football/Premier League/Showcase\nWhat time does coverage start? 12:00 (GMT)\nReferee? Rebecca Welch\nMan City team news\nDemi Stokes is struggling with illness and is set to miss out, while Esme Morgan is progressing as she continues her recovery from the injury sustained against Aston Villa, but Taylor admitted it was 'unlikely' she would feature.\nThe City boss explained that his squad was otherwise in good shape despite playing 120 minutes on Wednesday evening.\nArsenal team news\nLia Walti returned to the Arsenal bench against City following a short spell on the sidelines, while Beth Mead and Vivianne Miedema continue to miss out for the Gunners with ACL injuries.\nEidevall opted to play a back five for the first time during Wednesday's Conti Cup victory - will he stick or twist on Saturday?\nMan City vs Arsenal score prediction\nMan City saw their 16-game unbeaten run come to an end on Wednesday as they came out second best in a tightly-contested encounter. Although they will be cheered on by a sell out home crowd on Saturday, it could be more of the same.\nIf the service can be cut to the destructive Chloe Kelly and Lauren Hemp on either wing, then City can often struggle for a plan B. The change of shape and impact subs that Arsenal were able to bring on demonstrated the adaptability that the Gunners have, and could see them again edge out an even contest.",
