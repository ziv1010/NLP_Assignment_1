Los Blancos came out on top again, winning 1-0 thanks to a Gonzalo Garcia header in the Club World Cup round of 16.\nXabi Alonso's side come into this match with two wins out of two in the Champions League but are suffering a spate of injuries that are primarily defensive.\nDavid Alaba, Dean Huijsen, Ferland Mendy, Antonio Rudiger, Dani Carvajal and Trent Alexander-Arnold are all either doubts or confirmed absentees on Wednesday and beyond.\nIgor Tudor and Juventus might have an opportunity to exploit that situation, though Real Madrid naturally have adequate understudies across the back line.\nThe Bianconeri have some issues of their own. Juventus are winless in six matches in all competitions – Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Como followed a run of five successive draws that included both of their Champions League matches.\nThey started with a 4-4 draw against Borussia Dortmund and a 2-2 draw at Villarreal.\nJuventus are averaging a goal conceded every game in Serie A this season and are in seventh place after seven matches despite losing only once.\nFourFourTwo's prediction\nReal Madrid 3-1 Juventus\nHome advantage and historical superiority should help Real Madrid overcome defensive absences but it's Juve's poor form that will really make the difference.\nWe test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses.
