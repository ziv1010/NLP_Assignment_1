Pathetic. On principe alone we should not be entertaining this nonsense.\nA proper prestige friendly to whet the appetite please. Not a nothing club.\nHow difficult is it to arrange one fixture! Just a phone call perhaps.\nWhy has life become so difficult.\nWe always jointly considered our clubs to be on an equal par regarding honours, stadiums, support, although I always had champions of England as the ace up my sleeve!\nUnfortunately for us, since their victory over us in the play offs and their stay in the top flight, the gulf between the two clubs is huge. As much as it pains me to say, this is the reality.\nLet's hope this fixture goes ahead.\nIt will give the new manager his first experience against premier league opposition and a yardstick to the task ahead.\nPlus it will give me a chance to listen to stories of the icf, how they all go to watch Leyton orient when west ham are away and how they and everyone else with a slight essex accent were in the blind beggar the night Reggie shot George Cornell.\nMust have been the busiest pub in London on a Tuesday night.\nI bloody hate west ham fans\nThey have just got promoted and would bring loads of fans over for a proper trouble free party---why cant our blinkered leaders see this?\nWe do not seem to offer the same courtesy that Dusseldorf gave us--very sad.\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
