  "body_text": "Group C: Spain (FIFA world ranking: 6), Japan (11), Costa Rica (36), Zambia (77)\nGroup C is wide open, considering the relative inconsistency, unpredictability and chaos surrounding some of the teams in this group. Spain are the favourites, but given the continued dispute between the national federation, head coach Jorge Vilda and some key players, it’s unclear how they might fare. If Spain do struggle, it could open the door for a surprise package to charge through.\nAdvertisement\nFixtures in full\n- July 21: Spain v Costa Rica (08:30 BST, 03:30 ET).\nWatch on BBC in the UK, on FS1 and Telemundo in the U.S. - July 22: Zambia v Japan (08:00 BST, 03:00 ET).\nWatch on BBC in the UK, on FS1 and Universo in the U.S. - July 26: Japan v Costa Rica (06:00 BST, 01:00 ET).\nWatch on ITV in UK, on FS1 and Universo in the U.S. - July 26: Spain v Zambia (08:30 BST, 03:30 ET).\nWatch on BBC in the UK, on FS1 and Telemundo in the U.S. - July 31: Costa Rica v Zambia (08:00 BST, 03:00 ET).\nWatch on ITV in the UK, on FS1 and Universo in the U.S. - July 31: Japan v Spain (08:00 BST, 03:00 ET).\nWatch on ITV in the UK, on FOX and Telemundo in the U.S.\nThe standout match is likely to be…\nThe opening fixture in this group is Spain vs Costa Rica, and it could be an exciting start to the tournament. The inexperience and rawness of Costa Rica could cause a troubled Spanish side problems and see them off to a shaky start. It has been a positive few years for Costa Rica, including a fourth-place finish at the 2022 CONCACAF Championship, but they have historically struggled against stronger opposition.\nA story to look out for…\nThe chaos surrounding Spain. Last year, 15 players from the national-team squad sent an email to the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) saying they did not want to be selected again until there were massive changes in the team’s coaching structure.\nThat original list of players included some of Spain’s biggest and best names, such as Barcelona team-mates Patri Guijarro, Sandra Panos, Mapi Leon, Claudia Pina, Aitana Bonmati and Mariona Caldentey. Some of the 15 have since recommitted to the team and will be part of the World Cup squad but Leon, Guijarro and Pina all opted to miss this tournament.\nEven without some of their Barcelona core, Spain have plenty of individual talent and that should be enough to get them to the round of 16 at least. But how deep they go in this tournament will depend on how they can ride through the disarray that surrounds them and work with Vilda.\nSpain have never made it to the quarter-finals of a Women’s World Cup, albeit they have qualified only twice before getting to this one.\nThis group’s galactico is…\nAlexia Putellas heads into this World Cup as a back-to-back Ballon d’Or Feminin winner and having just celebrated her second Champions League triumph in three years. She is the biggest name in women’s football and the fact she returned only in April from a 10-month absence because of an ACL injury — and is making a comeback amid an internal dispute involving her team-mates — makes this tournament even more dramatic for the Barcelona midfielder. This is not her first major tournament with Spain, having played at the past two World Cups and Euro 2017, but this time her star has reached new heights and all eyes will be on her.\nAdvertisement\nThis could be a breakthrough tournament for…\nMaika Hamano. The 19-year-old Japan forward, who will play for Chelsea next season, has been lighting up the Swedish league with Hammarby and will be one to watch this summer. She is rated as one of the best young strikers in world football, having already starred at the Under-20 World Cup a year ago. Hamano signed off at Hammarby by helping them claim a first Swedish Cup since 1995 and has been one of the most in-form strikers in Europe. With Mana Iwabuchi not making the squad, Hamano could be the answer as Japan, World Cup winners in 2011 and finalists four years later, attempt to re-establish themselves as a force at this level.\nYou might not know this but…\nThis is Zambia’s first appearance in the Women’s World Cup. At 77th in FIFA’s rankings — which is the highest they’ve ever been — the Africans are undoubtedly the minnows of Group C. Their debut on the global stage came at the Olympics in Japan two years ago and, despite conceding 10 goals in losing to the Netherlands and four in a draw with China, they still left their mark on the competition. Star striker Barbra Banda’s hat-trick against the Dutch was particularly memorable. Banda, who plays her club football in China, is a potent goalscorer and a genuine threat, but Zambia’s defence is likely to struggle against the more experienced sides in the group.\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)",
