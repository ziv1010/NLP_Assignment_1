  "body_text": "Arsenal centre-half Gabriel Magalhaes has suffered a muscle injury in his right thigh while on international duty and will miss Brazil’s friendly against Tunisia in France on Tuesday.\nThe centre-back appeared to be in pain and walked gingerly off the pitch holding his right leg in the 65th minute of Saturday’s friendly international against Senegal at the Emirates Stadium.\nAdvertisement\nIn a statement on Sunday, the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) said: “Arsenal player Gabriel Magalhaes was re-evaluated this Sunday (16) and underwent imaging tests that revealed a muscle injury in his right thigh.\n“Therefore, the player will not be travelling with the team to the match against Tunez in Lille. No other player will be called up to replace him”\nGabriel, who covered his face with his shirt in frustration as he left the field, had spent several minutes receiving treatment on the pitch before Brazil’s head coach Carlo Ancelotti replaced him with Roma’s Wesley Franca.\nThe 27-year-old defender has played every minute across Arsenal’s 11 Premier League matches to date this term, alongside starting in each of Mikel Arteta’s side’s four Champions League games.\nGabriel has played a pivotal role in Arsenal’s strong defensive record, with the side conceding just five goals across those 15 games in the Premier League and Champions League.\nEarlier on Saturday, Arsenal left-back Riccardo Calafiori withdrew rom the Italy squad before their final World Cup group-stage qualifier against Norway.\nCalafiori, 23, missed Italy’s victory over Moldova on Thursday, and head coach Gennaro Gattuso said while he could have played against Norway, this would not have been “fair” on the left-back or Arsenal.\nArsenal were without the injured Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Martinelli, Victor Gyokeres, Noni Madueke and Kai Havertz before November’s international break.\nThey return to action with a north London derby against rivals Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, November 23.",
