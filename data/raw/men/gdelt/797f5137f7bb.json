  "body_text": "Robert Lewandowski vs Karim Benzema: Who will win the Pichichi?\nRobert Lewandowski's goals helped proper Barcelona to the La Liga title, but could Karim Benzema yet pinch him to the Pichichi Trophy?\nLewandowski, after emerging as the world's leading marksman during his time in the Bundesliga, took little time to silence those who wondered whether or not he could score goals in another country.\nThe Pole isn't continuing to operate at his previous over a goal per game level, granted, but his impact at Barcelona has been felt greatly. His fine debut season in Catalonia peaked on Sunday night as he scored twice in a 4-2 derby victory over Espanyol which secured La Blaugrana the La Liga title with four games to spare.\nOver in the capital, it's been business as usual for regular goal-getter and 2022 Ballon d'Or winner, Benzema, although the Frenchman's campaign has been disrupted by niggling little injuries that often affect a player coming towards the end of their career.\nBarça's title triumph has been obvious since their triumph in the March Clasico, and Benzema's attentions have turned to the Champions League as Real seek to win their second consecutive European crown.\nThe two are well clear of Spain's other regular goalscorers and will now go head-to-head in the final stretch of the season to become the latest winner of Marca's famed Pichichi Trophy.\nRobert Lewandowski\nEyebrows were raised when Lewandowski pushed for a move to Barcelona from Bayern Munich, with many assuming that the Pole's opportunity to play for another big club had slid by because of his advancing years.\nNow 34, Lewandowski won everything there is to win in Germany multiple times over but is now on the cusp of adding the Pichichi Trophy to his impressive individual trophy haul after helping Barça to the La Liga title.\nLewandowski took his tally for the La Liga season up to 21 after he scored twice against Espanyol on Sunday night. Those strikes have come from just 30 appearances at a rate of 119 minutes per goal, with his shot accuracy for the season standing at 55% and his contribution in the build-up phase also impressive - six assists show as much.\nBarça's remaining fixtures also appear to be favourable for Lewandowski. La Blaugrana face three teams in the bottom half of the table before the season draws to a close, including Real Valladolid, who boast the fourth-worst defensive record in the division. Thus, the Polish hitman should have plenty of opportunities to extend his lead at the top of the scoring charts.\nBarcelona and Lewandowski's remaining fixtures\nKarim Benzema\nKarim Benzema has already cemented his legacy as one of Real Madrid's, La Liga's and even football's greatest ever strikers, but his thirst for goals shows no sign of drying up.\nThe 35-year-old bagged 27 in La Liga and 44 in all competitions during 2021/22 to win a maiden Ballon d'Or, and that ratio of scoring hasn't really dropped this season. The only that has prevented Benzema from usurping Lewandowski at the top of the scoring tree is injury problems - he has been limited to just 21 La Liga appearances at the time of writing.\nNevertheless, Benzema has still smashed in 17 goals for Real Madrid in that time, but Lewandowski's recent efforts have seen him extend his lead over the Frenchman at the top of the La Liga scoring charts. Benzema is now four behind the Pole with four games left.\nReal Madrid's remaining fixtures include tricky trips to Valencia and Sevilla as well as home bouts against Rayo Vallecano and Athletic Club. Carlo Ancelotti also has the Champions League to consider, and if Real were to advance into the final at Man City's expense, it's likely that Benzema would be preserved in bubble wrap ahead of the showpiece in Istanbul.\nReal Madrid and Benzema's remaining fixtures\nRobert Lewandowski & Karim Benzema - current La Liga goal record\nRobert Lewandowski or Karim Benzema: Who will win the Pichichi?\nAll signs currently point towards Lewandowski picking up the Pichichi Trophy in his first season.\nBarcelona enjoy a pretty simple run after facing Real Sociedad, and the Polish striker will certainly fancy his chances of extending his lead over Benzema further.\nReal's season concludes with a couple of tricky away encounters, and there's no guarantee that the Frenchman will feature in all of Los Blancos' remaining games given his struggles with injuries this term.\nLewandowski's lead is surely far too great for Benzema to make up with just four games remaining.\nWho has won the most Pichichi Trophies?\nYou might not be surprised to know that Lionel Messi holds the record of most Pichichi Trophy wins, having scooped the top scorer prize on no less than eight occasions.\nMessi's first triumph came during 2009/10, when he scored 34 goals in 35 appearances, but his crowning glory was to come during 2011/12 - the Argentine scored 50 goals in just 37 appearance en route to scoring an incredible 73 in all competitions.\nCristiano Ronaldo won three Pichichi Trophies during his time at Real Madrid, with Luis Suarez the only other player to win one between 2010 and 2021.",
