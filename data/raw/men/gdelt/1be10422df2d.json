  "body_text": "This summer transfer window is set to be another important one for Tottenham Hotspur.\nThe Lilywhites have been transformed under Ange Postecoglou and are still in with a chance of qualifying for next season’s Champions League.\nConsidering the landscape when the Australian was unveiled, with thoughts of how the club would fare if Harry Kane was sold, even if Spurs didn’t make it into the premier European competition, the 2023/24 season should still be seen as a success.\nOne player that has done well despite some personal challenges in the current campaign is Richarlison.\nTottenham could cash in on Richarlison this summer\nAccording to WhoScored, he’s managed 11 goals and three assists, including nine in his last 15 games.\nThose figures are decent enough for any striker, let alone one that has clearly been struggling away from the pitch.\nWhilst that won’t reflect badly on the Brazilian, it appears that the North Londoners are still ready to cash in on him.\nAccording to football.london (h/t The Boy Hotspur), the club are looking for a prolific goalscorer and may be willing to accept a lucrative offer from Saudi Pro League sides or otherwise.\nIt isn’t clear if the player himself would be amenable to any switch, though if it’s a choice between playing second fiddle or not, the likelihood is that Richarlison would want to be the main man.\nWith six games of their 2023/24 campaign still to play, there’s plenty of time for the striker to be able to make any notion of a move away moribund.\nIf his goals help to fire Tottenham into the Champions League, it may make the board think twice about cashing in on the Brazilian.\nIn many respects, it’s down to the player to show now, perhaps more than at any other point in the season, that he has what it takes to be a success in North London.",
