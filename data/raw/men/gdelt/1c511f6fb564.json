  "body_text": "The Allianz Arena looms as the car slows in the traffic.\nIt’s three hours until the Bundesliga’s biggest game of the season — Bayern Munich against Borussia Dortmund — and as we inch forward, Philipp Lahm is describing to The Athletic what it’s like to win the World Cup.\n“Actually, when you’re given the trophy — when it’s handed to you — you don’t think about the millions watching or how big the moment is. It wasn’t really like that.\nAdvertisement\n“As I was lifting it, I thought about what it had taken to get there. All the way back to the beginning at Bayern, when I was just a boy, and we had to fight for our place in the academy every year.\n“And you never really imagine winning the World Cup then, because it’s too big. First, you just want to make it in football. Then, it’s to play for Bayern and Germany. But the dream just gets bigger and bigger until one day, you’re holding the World Cup.\n“That 2014 team had been through a lot. We had won a lot of matches, but lost important ones too. And there were all these memories. From losing to Italy in 2006, Spain in 2008 and 2010, and Italy in 2012. Really hard moments.\n“And then you’re there with everyone with whom you’ve been on that journey and it’s just… finally, finally it’s ours.”\nLahm captained Germany 51 times, including on that famous day in Rio de Janeiro, in 2014. He captained Bayern Munich, too, and has won every trophy in reach.\nLahm is one of the greats of his era. A right-back, a left-back, a holding midfielder. A winner. But now he’s someone living a different football life.\nThe World Cup is not really what he wants to talk about. Hours earlier, Teutonia Munich took on FT Gern.\nCowbells clanged and parents hollered from a mound above the pitch. Coaches boomed their instructions from the sideline. It was a local derby, and it felt like it.\nLahm was on the touchline, too. Three times a week, he is Gern Under-14s’ assistant coach.\nIt’s where it began for him. Before Bayern, Germany and the rest, it was his first club. He joined when he was five, following in a family tradition. His father, grandfather and uncle all played for Gern. His mother was head of its youth department for 20 years, and his son, Julian, plays for the under-14s.\n“Gern was my second home as a boy,” he explains later. “My family was always involved with the club. My mother is on the board now, my father and uncle are here too. And I grew up five minutes away.\nAdvertisement\n“Last year, when the assistant coach had to stop, the head coach — one of my oldest friends — asked me if I wanted to help. And of course: why not?\n“The kids have got used to me. I’m just another coach. Another dad. It’s wonderful to be able to come back now and see so many people who knew me all those years ago. A lot of the people who make the club run have been helping out for decades. To them, I’m not Philipp Lahm who played for Bayern Munich, I’m just Philipp.”\nHe watches the game quietly from the bench and sees his son, a winger, score, as Gern take a 2-0 lead in the first half.\nThis was not the route he was expected to take. Back in 2017, Lahm was 33. He had a year left on his Bayern contract but decided to retire. Carlo Ancelotti, then his head coach, invited him to become one of his assistants. Lahm, celebrated by Pep Guardiola as the most intelligent player he had worked with, seemed destined to follow in those footsteps.\nBut Lahm said no to Ancelotti. As far as his coaching ambitions go, Gern is the extent of it: two training sessions a week and a match on Saturdays. It’s community football.\nGern cannot hold their lead. They concede three goals and lose, and at full time their young players troop to the dressing rooms.\n“This is grassroots football!” Lahm says cheerfully, waving away the commiserations. “We’re not trying to create professional players. And we shouldn’t, because how many ever get that chance?\n“For us, it’s more important to teach the boys what it means to be in a team. Every child has different strengths, so at this level it’s about bringing all of those abilities together, whatever they are, and then teaching these kids how to win and lose, and to get better together.\n“I know football well. Yes, I can help explain the game. But the values are worth more: team spirit, fair play, respecting the rules of the game, togetherness and friendships — building confidence in young people is essential.”\nAdvertisement\n“And,” he says, pointing back to the scene of the derby defeat, “so is coping with setbacks and difficulty.\n“For me, it’s fun — and I get to spend time with my son — but these things matter in life, whatever direction someone goes in as they get older.”\nThis is not some post-retirement jaunt. Lahm established his foundation in 2007, in the middle of his career, after a pre-2010 World Cup visit to South Africa. In the almost two decades since, the Philipp Lahm Stiftung has helped support disadvantaged children in Germany and South Africa, promoting the value of health, nutrition and education, and providing access to sporting facilities that encourage participation across social boundaries.\nLahm was also Euro 2024’s tournament director and its public face.\nBack in 2006, when Germany hosted the World Cup, he was part of a young national team that captured hearts during what became known as the ‘Summer Fairytale’. Germany were eliminated by Italy in the semi-final, but not before the beautiful weather and their bold, exuberant football had revived a sagging national mood.\nIt meant that when the DFB — the German Football Association — were looking for a public face for 2024, Lahm’s connection to 2006 made him an obvious candidate.\nHe took the job, helming Germany’s successful bid, but it was on the condition that he would then serve as the tournament’s director.\n“A huge challenge,” he says, laughing gently, “but also fascinating. I played the World Cup at home in 2006, and I’ll never forget the atmosphere. Not only in the stadiums, but around the country and in the fanparks. It was wonderful for Germany and indescribable to be at the centre of it.\n“I didn’t really know what to expect when we delivered the tournament or how much would be involved. You deal with the government, the different states, UEFA, policing; there were so many parts of that that were new to me. But it was my life for nearly six years; it takes so much more time than you realise.”\nLahm enjoyed being out of his comfort zone and inhabiting rooms that footballers so rarely see.\nAdvertisement\nHis role also allowed him to channel part of the tournament’s energy back into grassroots participation. In the aftermath, he launched Treffpunkt Verein — Club Meeting Point — with the aim of buttressing Germany’s amateur sports clubs and other associations by connecting them with powerful partners — companies, foundations, even government agencies.\nIt’s an ally, during a time when resources are stretched and clubs are fighting for attention and support.\nLong after the youth game has finished, with the car edging into Allianz Arena’s underground parking lot, Lahm is reflecting on why this has become such a focus of his post-career life.\n“Because grassroots sport is so important for our country. That’s why I always wanted to help.\n“It matters because everyone can go and be part of something. There’s a grassroots club for everyone — or there should be. It’s not about where someone comes from in society, or about whether they have money or not, or even how talented someone is.\n“They help people — they can help them fit in. People who are shy or who are new to the country, there’s such value in allowing them to belong to something.\n“I was really lucky, because my experience was privileged, but I want others to have that too. Football for me was always fun, but it was so much more than that. I loved the game and what it felt like to be part of a team — to be more than you were alone.\n“Gern was where it began for me. Bayern, Germany, everything. And it started there because, originally, I wanted to play football. But it gave me a new family and a big community, and people who are still in my life to this day.\n“I wasn’t coaching those boys today because I used to be captain of Germany. It was because one of my oldest friends asked me to come and help him out.”\nIn October 2025, in recognition of his services to the community, Lahm was awarded Germany’s Order of Merit by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.\nBut why did he never coach professionally? After all, German clubs, especially Bayern, are full of former players living second acts, all the way up to the boardroom.\nHe takes a minute as the car pulls to a stop.\nAdvertisement\n“I had Pep Guardiola as a coach, and I saw how he thought about the game. All day, every day. It was everything to him. It was football, football, football, even when he wasn’t coaching or planning matches, and I’m sure it’s still that way for him now.\n“But it wasn’t the right thing for me. When I do something, I also want to do it properly — fully, 100 per cent, like Pep does — but coaching every day was not what I wanted to dedicate myself to. It’s not really who I am.\n“And I wanted distance from football. Remember, I joined the Bayern academy when I was 12 years old, so it had dominated my life for nearly 22 years by the time I finished. It’s not a bad idea to get some distance.”\nSome distance — but not too much. Lahm works with Stuttgart as a consultant, supporting long-term sporting decisions, working with sponsors and stakeholders, and providing an external perspective for the club.\nAnd he is part of the DFL’s Legends Network. While the Bundesliga has the second-highest domestic broadcasting contract (behind the Premier League), its overseas rights are growing more slowly and face more of a challenge.\nWith the 50+1 rule prohibiting majority investment and the strength of the native fan culture ensuring that staging competitive games outside the country is impossible, the DFL has to be creative. Lahm is part of a community of 18 ex-players — which includes Lothar Matthaus, Lukas Podolski, Claudio Pizarro, Jurgen Klinsmann and Jay-Jay Okocha — who help sell the league to the outside world.\nIt’s a stellar cast and for the Bundesliga’s biggest occasions, Lahm’s role is to run a gauntlet of media appearances before, during and after the game. He extols the homespun virtues of German football, trying to make sure the world understands why its regionality and atmosphere matter, and are worth as much as the glamour in England or Spain.\nAdvertisement\nWhat’s it like to walk around Allianz Arena with Lahm?\nIt’s like being Lorraine Bracco in that famous scene from Goodfellas, during which Ray Liotta leads her through the kitchens and into the restaurant.\nChildren lean from the stands before the game, begging him to sign shirts and take photos as he walks the perimeter of the pitch. At the foot of the Suedkurve, a shirtless, heavily tattooed ultra, pink from the autumnal cold, reaches over the top of the terrace to embrace him and welcome him back.\n“When I was a player,” he says, asked about what it was that made him a successful captain, “I think I knew what it was to represent the club, both on and off the field. That means with the armband, but also with the media and the supporters, inside and away from the stadium, giving time to people to whom the club matters.”\nSuddenly, Bastian Schweinsteiger appears from a tunnel to wrap him in a bear hug. They turn away together, right to the touchline, looking out across the pitch on which, together, they achieved so much.\nLahm drifts in and out of appointments. Serbia’s TV Arena. Sky Mexico. At a roundtable with South American journalists, a Brazilian reporter — still hurting — asks whether there’s anything new he can tell him about Germany’s 7-1 win in the semi-final of the 2014 World Cup.\n“I’m really, really sorry about that,” he begins, as the room laughs.\nBayern Munich like to describe themselves as a family. There’s an earnestness to that which feels misplaced in modern football — disingenuous, even, given the size of the club and its commercial muscularity.\nBut their stadium is full of people who have been there for a long time. Lahm is one of them. He was a ballboy at the Olympiastadion, the club’s home from 1972 to 2005. He worked the night of the 1997 Champions League final, when Lars Ricken scored the famous clinching goal immediately after coming on as a substitute.\nAdvertisement\nSecurity guards and doormen greet Lahm like old uncles. When he arrives at the media centre, one of the women working comes running out from within the alcove to wrap their arms around him and take a photo.\n“They were here when I first joined.” he says. “They’ve watched me grow up.”\nLothar Matthaus appears, suddenly, marching purposefully in from somewhere, with his 150 caps for Germany and a cheerful “Philipp!”\nMatthaus is also one of Sky Deutschland’s headline pundits, and he and Lahm — alongside Julia Simic — are on half-time duty, during which they disagree about the decision to award Bayern the first goal against Dortmund.\nAfter Lahm steps off the set, fans reach out from the stands again. Pens, phones, shirts. Standing aside, trying not to get in the way, a red and white scarf drops on my head and knocks my glasses off. I look up to see a stern young boy, pointing his finger at Lahm.\nI do as I’m told.\nBayern win 2-1 and the crowd drains happily out of the Allianz Arena and into the night.\nInside, it’s getting cold; winter is on its way. But there are more media duties. As Lahm is conducting a long interview with the DFL with his back to the pitch, a mother and daughter approach down one of the vacant rows to ask how long he will be.\nAt least 20 minutes, a producer warns, scrunching his face in apology.\nThey wait. When the interview is over, the mother takes her daughter by the hand and introduces herself to Lahm. Her father, the girl’s grandfather, is a huge Bayern fan, but is not well.\nCould they take a picture?\nLahm takes the camera as mother and daughter gather around him, and records a video, talking to the grandfather as the young girl gently sobs.\nLahm knows who he is and what he represents here.\nAnd this is a full life he’s leading. Before Lahm disappears into a hospitality lounge full of people who want to hear about Brazil, the World Cup and all his yesterdays, The Athletic asks whether he misses playing.\n“No,” he says, with a definitive shake of the head.\nBut not even on days like this, when the stadium is full and the whole world is watching?\nHe pauses. Then a slight smile.\nAdvertisement\n“Maybe the dressing room. Those minutes before the game, when you’re together and you can feel all the readiness and the adrenaline.\n“Bastian Schweinsteiger would be loud. I would be talking to Arjen Robben or Franck Ribery, then I’d be speaking with my centre-backs or whoever was playing around me, knowing that everybody was with you and understood their jobs. That’s a special place and I had that from the age of five.\n“So I do miss it. Just a bit. But I’m happy with what I have now.”",
