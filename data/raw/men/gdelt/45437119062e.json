The governing body said each of its licensed clubs must have a dedicated \"disabled access officer,\" and noted that accessibility guidelines compiled in collaboration with AccessibAll were launched in September. The guidelines stipulate that wheelchair-user spaces shouldn't be located only in home supporter sectors.\nOne of the first initiatives similar to Atletico's came in 2015, when more than 1,000 disabled fans attended a local match in Poland, according to UEFA. Little else has been done since then, with Betis' initiative coming nearly a decade later.\n\"We found that it’s time to launch more than a record, it’s time to launch a movement,\" AccessibAll CEO Olivier Jarosz told the AP. \"When we think about disability, we tend to think that it’s people on wheelchairs. And actually wheelchair users are 7%, so it’s a true minority. The majority of disabilities are non-visible. It could be visual, it could be mental, it could be cognitive. And there are many, many different challenges.\"\nAccording to data from the European Union, 27% of the EU population over the age of 16 had some form of disability in 2023.\nMayo said Atletico was already contacted by other European clubs, without specifying them, to get more information about the initiative.\n\"We decided to do it in a UEFA match because the visibility is bigger,\" Mayo said. \"And I think that if this helps to invite the rest of the teams to join in similar initiatives, it would be great.\"\nMany times clubs don't take action because they think there are not enough fans with disabilities interested in attending their matches, so initiatives like the ones by Atletico should help show them that there is a demand for better services.\nGermany is likely the country better prepared for fans with disabilities, Jarosz said, in part because it has \"the best stadiums\" that were used recently in the European Championship. He said the fact that clubs are traditionally owned by fans also helps, and society in general in the country is more used to servicing people with disabilities.\nHe said France also has improved recently, thanks to Paris having hosted the Olympics and the Paralympics.\n\"Certainly things are changing, but they are not moving enough,\" Jarosz said. \"It’s very difficult to tell you on the global scale the situation, but certainly the governing bodies like FIFA and UEFA realized that this is important because it’s part of the population.\"\nAtletico attracted fans with disabilities for Wednesday’s match by selling tickets to them at reduced prices and working with its fan groups to spread the word about the campaign.\nMayo said Atletico prepared an \"intensive operation\" to host the match. There will be specific parking places reserved for supporters with disabilities, and employees dedicated exclusively to help them.\nAtletico’s 70,000-capacity stadium is one of the newest and most modern ones in Europe, and is considered to be fully equipped to welcome fans with disabilities. Access to and from the stadium in the Spanish capital is also considered to be adequate.\nThere will be activities before the match at Metropolitano, with exhibitions of wheelchair soccer and stands with information about different types of disabilities. Actors from the Spanish movie \"Campeones,\" a highly successful comedy about the importance of inclusion, were set to be on hand, as were members of the Spain blind soccer team.\n\"These types of actions help make the people aware of the importance to think of them,\" Mayo said.\nThe Spanish government, through its inclusion ministry, was also involved in the initiative.",
