  "body_text": "Six English teams playing in the ‘Champions’ League is an absurdity\nNowhere was the news that Tottenham Hotspur will meet Manchester United in the Europa League final celebrated with more gusto than in the two clubs’ accounts departments.\nNever mind the evidence it delivers of the strength of the English club game, never mind the potential silverware, never mind the glory, it means the pair are now just one step away from the thing considered most important in modern football: access to the hundreds of millions of pounds of additional revenue that come with Champions League qualification.\nAnd it is money, naturally, that speaks loudest in modern football. Because, for those with no financial skin in the game, it might be thought nothing could be as bizarre as two sides destined to finish in the lower boondocks of the Premier League still in with a shout of qualifying for Europe’s senior competition. How did that happen?\nWell, as Boris Johnson might put it, them’s the rules. The winners of the Europa League have for some time now been promoted to the main event for the next season. Besides, that is not the only ridiculousness associated with a tournament bulked up to aid the cash flow of the continent’s leading clubs.\nThanks to coefficients, ratios, place demarcation and other methodologies for ensuring the rich remain rich, five teams from the Premier League will make it into the tournament next season from their league position.\nA sixth finding their way via this forthcoming all-English Europa final, is but an additional layer of absurdity. Yes, whoever wins in Bilbao, it means next season that 30 per cent of the Premier League will be playing in Europe’s senior competition.\nIt is way too late for those who believe in a certain integrity in their sporting contests to complain about the relentless watering down of the Champions League’s purpose.\nThe time has long gone to hark back to the glorious days when the only way two clubs from the same country could make it into the European Cup is for one of them to have won the thing the previous season.\nMoney long ago put paid to that sort of assumption. Just as it did the kind of open draw in a wholly knock-out process which pitted Liverpool (the holders) against Nottingham Forest (the English League champions) in the first round in the autumn of 1978.\nThe very idea that whichever outfit wins it this year are guaranteed but two games in next season’s edition would be laughed out of every boardroom across Europe.\nBut there was something in the jeopardy of such a draw that made the European Cup such a compelling concept, an attraction that has long since been lost in ever expanding group stages designed solely to bolster the bottom line.\nMaybe the problem we hopeless nostalgists have is in its name. After all, as titles go, the Champions League does offer the suggestion that this is a place where you can only find the champion club of each participating country.\nThat, though, was a ship that sailed long ago. Since the mid nineties, when the competition expanded to cater to the financial demands of the big clubs, such a concept was greedily dispensed with.\nUnited and Spurs are not the first to benefit. For a decade Arsène Wenger was lauded for getting Arsenal up to the fourth place to ensure qualification, indeed Liverpool have twice lifted the trophy since the turn of the century without having previously won their domestic league.\nAnd it’s only getting worse. These days, in the early, bloated, league stages, when clubs qualify who would require the services of the Hubble telescope to spot their domestic champions disappearing over the horizon, league winners make up an increasingly diminished proportion of the entrants.\nOf course should Manchester United or Tottenham defy all expectations and lift the giant trophy next season, for their fans such caveats will be redundant.\nBut for those who once cherished the ultimate in elite competition, just the tiniest of asterisks will be applied to their record. These, after all, would be the champions who qualified via the emergency exit.",
