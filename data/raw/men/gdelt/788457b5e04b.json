Asked if there was a point at which he would consider stepping aside, he snapped back: “No, that’s not going to happen”.\nBut with the atmosphere at the club growing restless, the decision may be taken out of his hands. Shortly before kick-off on Wednesday evening AFCA, the second largest Ajax supporters’ club, released a statement calling for Heitinga to be replaced.\nTen Hag, who led Ajax to the semi-final of the Champions League in 2019, is a free agent after being sacked by Bayer Leverkusen in August just three matches into his reign, though he has also been linked to the vacant manager’s job at English Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers.\nHeitinga has been at the helm since Francesco Farioli’s abrupt departure at the end of last season, but fans see his lack of experience as a first-team coach – he was previously assistant to Arne Slot at Liverpool – as evidence that the club lacks ambition.\n“Huge respect”\nAFCA said it had “huge respect for Johnny Heitinga as a player”, referring to the seven years he spent as a defender at the club between 2001 and 2008. “But we are judging him now as the coach of the Ajax first team,” they said.\n“After 11 league matches, eight points behind [Feyenoord and PSV in the Eredivisie], the miserable performances in the Champions League and a style of football that’s enough to make you weep, the only conclusion we can come to is that Johnny is not the right head coach for Ajax. It’s time for a new coach with experience!”\nHeitinga replied in the post-match press conference: “I haven’t seen the statement, but it’s obviously disappointing to hear. I’m a real son of this club, I’ll give my all for Ajax.”\nTo rub salt into the wounds, Farioli, the coach who took Ajax within a whisker of winning the league title last season, is back in the Netherlands with his new club, Porto, who are playing Utrecht in the Europa League.\nFarioli keeps counsel\nPorto are top of their domestic league with nine wins from 10 games and in contention to progress in Europe’s second-tier competition. But the Italian deflected questions about whether the fans’ growing appreciation of his achievements since Heitinga took over made him feel proud.\n“What would have made me feel proud was giving the title back to Ajax,” he said. “But unfortunately it wasn’t possible.\n“I’m watching the games as a supporter from a distance,” Farioli said when asked his former club’s current predicament. “I don’t think it’s kind to comment.”\nAjax have a chance of salvaging some pride in their next Champions League match on November 25 when they take on Benfica, the only other team with no points from their opening four games. The question is whether Heitinga will still be in a position to take advantage.\nThank you for donating to DutchNews.nl.\nWe could not provide the Dutch News service, and keep it free of charge, without the generous support of our readers.
