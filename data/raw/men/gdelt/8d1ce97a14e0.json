It wasn’t our day.\nFull time still had to be celebrated though, as Howe’s miracle work came to the fore again.\nSince December he has overseen 46 points from 20 games. Absolutely phenomenal. The man is turning water into wine.\nPope saves and Callum’s tears\nOur custodian had a good game.\nIt was a reminder of how important Nick Pope is to the cause. He’s nearing his peak and I expect he will be our number one next season – and rightly so.\nHe made some good saves, capping off a good season after previous injury problems.\nA final mention for Callum Wilson. This appeared to be his final game for Newcastle United, with his emotional goodbye at the end a hint that he’s going to be leaving the football club after five years.\nHe’s done his bit. He arrived when Ashley was still owner and played a vital role in two seasons of Premier League survival when Steve Bruce was in charge.\nWithout that contribution, the takeover of the club may never have happened.\nThe injury problems have blighted him, which was a big shame. He’s a great finisher when he’s fully fit. All the best to him on his next challenge.\nResults elsewhere\nOf all the permutations on the final day, not many will have seen a Newcastle loss allied to that Man Utd side seeing off Aston Villa, as the final act of this unreal football season.\nYet that’s exactly what has happened. You couldn’t make it up.\nThere was huge controversy with the VAR at Old Trafford, so you’d have to say that the final twist really did go our way.\nWith the Villa keeper also sent off – another huge moment – Emery’s side have slipped up, big time, allowing us to pinch that Champions League spot.\nI’m sure the Villa board are now assessing the financial implications of that. Our last gasp draw at Brighton a few weeks ago also now looks absolutely huge.\nSunday wasn’t the way anyone wanted the final day to play out but it’ll certainly live long in the memory.\nNEGATIVES\nTactical misfire?\nThree at the back didn’t work. Murphy needed to be higher up the pitch and we seemed to miss the extra man in midfield.\nOne for the manager to review and learn from.\nForm, injuries and burnout\nWe ended the season with a few questions.\nThe form of Anthony Gordon is a slight concern – is he carrying a knock? Is he unsettled?\nThere was much talk about the fitness of Isak too. He made the starting line up but is that groin injury nagging away at him?\nJoelinton has been a huge miss since he succumbed to a knee problem. How bad is that one?\nFinally, after such a hard season, there was maybe some burnout. Tired minds and legs in the final lap just let it slip against an Everton side having a mini revival under Moyes.\nSquad depth\nWe desperately need some fresh blood this summer.\nA phase two of the project since the takeover – if you want to call it that.\nWe just seem to be lacking in a few areas in terms of depth. An extra attacking option, something new in midfield, and more bodies at the back to share the load.\nAfter three transfer windows of standing still it’s a huge summer. Finances permitting, the club has to invest.\nHowe’s post-match quotes about working quickly on deals was significant.\nHe clearly wants the board to work faster – like many other clubs do – to get deals done.\nIt’s a case of over to the Sporting Director, Paul Mitchell.\nThe Champions League is going to be so tough. It will stretch that squad. We need at least three of four players in. Maybe even a few loans?\nThe hard work starts here.\nNewcastle 0 Everton 1 – Sunday 25 May 4pm\n(Stats via BBC Sport)\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nEverton:\nAlcaraz 65\nPossession was Newcastle 66% Everton 34%\nTotal shots were Newcastle 17 Everton 14\nShots on target were Newcastle 6 Everton 6\nCorners were Newcastle 12 Everton 3\nTouches in the box Newcastle 28 Everton 13\nNewcastle team v Everton:\nPope, Botman (Trippier 63), Schar, Burn, Livramento, Gordon (Willock 46), Tonali, Bruno, Barnes (Osula 88), Isak, Murphy (Wilson 70)\nUnused Subs:\nDubravka, Lascelles, Longstaff, Krafth, Miley\n(BBC Sport comments from ‘neutrals’ – Interesting on Newcastle United after Champions League qualification – Read HERE)\n(Newcastle United deserved Champions League – Eddie Howe – Read HERE)\n(Newcastle 0 Everton 1 – Instant Newcastle United fan/writer reaction to Champions League qualification!
