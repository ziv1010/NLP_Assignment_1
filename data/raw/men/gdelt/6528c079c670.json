  "body_text": "Arsenal have formally announced the signing of goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga from Chelsea on a long-term deal.\nThe Gunners had Neto as their backup shot-stopper behind David Raya last season. The Brazilian made just one appearance in the Champions League where he was largely error-prone.\nNeto recently returned to Bournemouth after his season-long loan. Arsenal have now confirmed Arrizabalaga as his successor. He has been signed for his £5 million release clause.\nArrizabalaga told the club’s official website: “I’m really, really happy to be here, really excited and looking forward to what is coming.\n“The ambition that is shown in this club, when I talk with Mikel [Arteta] and Inaki [Cana], how much they show me their desire to win.\n“I think we are so close to winning and, hopefully, altogether, we can achieve it.”\nArrizabalaga had a tough career with the Blues, but he fared much better away from the club last term.\nThe Spaniard spent the campaign on loan with Bournemouth. He made almost 100 saves in the league and had a save success rate of 71 percent – the fourth best in the division.\nArrizabalaga also kept eight clean sheets for the South Coast outfit. He has had a weakness against long-range shots in the past, but conceded just twice from such situations.\nThe Athletic Club graduate had the opportunity to play regular first-team football elsewhere, but he has now accepted the deputy shot-stopper position behind Raya.\nThe 30-year-old, who was on £75,000 per week at Chelsea, should represent a good signing for the Gunners, considering his vast Premier League experience with 140 appearances.\nArsenal were previously keen on landing Espanyol sensation Joan Garcia for £21m, but sporting director Andrea Berta had reservations over spending big for a backup.\nGarcia eventually chose to join Barcelona instead. In the process, Arsenal have saved £16m in transfer funds, which should be added to the budget to bolster the attack.\nStats from Sofascore.com & Capology.com",
