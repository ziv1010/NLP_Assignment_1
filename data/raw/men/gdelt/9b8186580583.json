Football has gone very modern and much more international. Look at the major clubs in England, for instance, Arsenal, it is owned by foreigners. Manchester has gone the same way, Liverpool and almost all the other clubs have gone that way. If the owner can probably set tradition aside and get investors whether they’re Ghanaians, foreigners or whoever who will come and join the club because they have invested money in it and they expect returns I’m sure they will work better,” he stated.\nOwusu Bempah, who is also a football historian, expressed concern about how people are selected to the club’s Board.\n“The way things are right now, where people are called to join the Kotoko board in an effort to extol the owner will never work for Kotoko. So we need serious investors and we can get the investment whether the person knows that he or she or the individual or organization owns part of the club and therefore they think that where you’ve invested your money you will never allow some of these mediocre things happening in the club to derail your investment,” he said.\nAsante Kotoko were last eliminated in the preliminary stage of the CAF Champions League by RC Kadiogo of Burkina Faso and are currently fifth on the Ghana Premier League table, eight points adrift league leaders Aduana Stars.\nLatest Stories\n-\nThe Accra Mandate: Securing Africa’s AI Future through Local Data and Ethical Governance\n19 minutes -\nAquafresh donates to National Chief Imam ahead of Ramadan\n44 minutes -\nAdopt a mix of bond and short-term finance to address financing challenges in cocoa industry – Professor Peprah to government\n46 minutes -\nNSA introduces dual authentication system for 2025/26 enrolment exercise\n2 hours -\nFuel prices to increase from Feb. 16, influenced by cedi’s depreciation\n2 hours -\nGNFS to launch automated fire safety compliance system to modernise regulation\n3 hours -\nNALAG president commends Local Gov’t Minister for payment of assembly members’ allowances\n3 hours -\nIs having a physical security operations center in your business worth it?\n3 hours -\nAsiedu Nketia recounts fierce political wars in Ajumako-Enyan-Essiam constituency\n3 hours -\nNRSA sets up committee to probe road crashes involving Toyota Voxy\n3 hours -\nCocoa farmers decry the adverse impact of producer price cut on livelihoods\n3 hours -\nFamilies who lose relatives to ‘no bed syndrome’ must sue health facilities – Dr. Nawaane\n3 hours -\nGhana Sports Fund: Dr. David Kofi Wuaku outlines vision for Youth Empowerment growth through sports\n3 hours -\nNUGS President urges sustainable digital governance\n3 hours -\nNational Investment Bank kicks off Ghana Sports Fund with landmark seed donation\n3 hours",
