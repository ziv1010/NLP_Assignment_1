  "body_text": "Wednesday night saw Hansi Flick up against his old club, Bayern Munich, for the first time.\nThree talking points from Barcelona 4-1 Bayern\nHansi Flick’s reunion couldn’t have gone better\nA club side that inflicted Barca’s heaviest defeat (8-2) in 75 years back in August 2020 when Flick himself was in charge.\nAhead of the test against the Bavarian giants, the hosts didn’t need reminding that it was way back in 2015 when they last got the better of Bayern.\nIn the six separate attempts since, Barca had lost them all, scoring only twice in a meaningless 2015 Champions League semi-final second leg, and two more in the 8-2 hammering. In every other match-up, the Blaugranes hadn’t found the net.\nTherefore the odds were clearly stacked against the hosts....let’s look at the talking points from Barca’s brilliant 4-1 win.\nTour de Force from centurion Raphinha\nOn the occasion of his 100th appearance for the club, Raphinha was in sensational form.\nThe Brazilian has consistently been Barca’s best player in 2024/25, and he showed once again that he’s the go-to guy for the big occasion.\nA cool, calm head saw him slide in the game’s opener in the first minute, and his control and purpose after receiving Marc Casado’s sensational pass, ensured that his second on the night was never in doubt.\nHis third was arguably the best of the bunch, controlling Lamine’s pass on his chest before powering home past a despairing Manuel Neuer.\nIt wasn’t just the goals that elevated his performance above his contemporaries, however.\nRaphinha was everywhere, hurrying and hassling the opposition and never allowing Bayern a moment’s peace.\nFrankly, it was a ridiculously good individual performance and undoubtedly one of the best of the season.\nCounter-attacking excellence\nIf Wednesday night’s game taught us anything, it’s that Barcelona can finally play effectively on the counter attack - and against one of European football’s most storied clubs to boot.\nThe Catalans ceded two-thirds of the possession against an attacking Bayern side, who played almost 200 more passes than the hosts.\nWhen it mattered, however, Barca were clinical.\nFour goals from four shots on target tells its own story, Robert Lewandowski getting in on the act for the first time against his old employers.\nPedri and Marc Casado often got the better of potential Barca target, Joshua Kimmich, as well as Joao Palhinha in central midfield, and that allowed the Blaugranes to play more expansive and incessantly attack down the wings.\nHansi Flick’s tactics were spot on... again.\nConcerns ahead of El Clasico\nAlthough it’s difficult to criticise Jules Kounde and Alejandro Balde after such a brilliant victory, they still gave Flick enough to worry about on the night and ahead of El Clasico.\nBoth got forward with ease, though often found it difficult to penetrate in the wide areas when given the opportunity.\nDefensively they were ok without being outstanding, but they were often found wanting in terms of their positioning.\nIt was something Balde was particularly guilty of and by consistently coming inside, he left acres of space in behind.\nHe was lucky that Bayern were unable to capitalise on many occasions and against the pace of Kylian Mbappe and Vini Jr. both full-backs will have to be much more disciplined.",
