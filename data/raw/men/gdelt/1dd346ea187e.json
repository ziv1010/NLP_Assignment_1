In the second half they had 49.2% possession and a passing accuracy of 84.7%, facing six shots. Swing. pic.twitter.com/qHVX5ioT1M\n— OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) February 22, 2023\nOne of 11 unused substitutes that night was Phil Foden, whose season has sparked back into life after four goals and an assist in City’s four games since, putting him right into contention for a Champions League start.\nAble to punch through the defensive lines with incisive forward carries, as we saw against Newcastle United last weekend, the 22-year-old will undoubtedly add an extra edge to Guardiola’s multi-pronged attack.\nThe speed with which Foden was able to control the switched pass here before driving into the space between the lines and into the penalty area demonstrates the potency that he can offer — particularly if Leipzig find themselves penned in and defending deep.\nAdvertisement\nAfter the self-confessed “lowest point” of his career recently, Foden has attempted 31 take-ons across his last 407 minutes of football – nearly seven a game – an illustration of the renewed vigour in his game.\nWhile Guardiola repeatedly stated his desire for “control” in the first leg, being particularly wary of the threat Leipzig possess on the transition, perhaps Foden’s energy can help City turn that side-to-side possession into a more focused forward thrust.\nRB Leipzig\nNow heading into his fourth Champions League knockout-phase match – all against City, bizarrely – Leipzig coach Marco Rose’s courageous tactical switch-up during half-time of the first leg means we still have a tie on our hands.\nReplacing a more defensive Lukas Klostermann with wing-back Benjamin Henrichs, the former Borussia Monchengladbach boss encouraged both full-backs to attack more aggressively in the second half, looking to exploit the wide space behind City’s advanced defensive line.\nFocusing their attacks down the left – with 60.2 per cent of their attacking touches coming down that flank in an encouraging second half – left-back Marcel Halstenberg didn’t hesitate to attack around the outside of an adventurous Kyle Walker.\nHis attacking team-mates were also brave, attempting to overload the left flank to drag Nathan Ake inside, leaving Henrichs with space to attack over on the right.\nLeipzig’s best chance before their eventual equaliser came from such a move…\nFor a side renowned for their counter-attacking capabilities and quick, transitional play, Leipzig were surprisingly measured in their build-up, recording their lowest direct speed in their Champions League history. In fact, all six of Rose’s European games as their coach fall in Leipzig’s bottom 10 in that regard, outlining a team with increased confidence in their technical ability to build slowly alongside their more familiar sudden bursts forward.\nAdvertisement\nStill able to launch those devastating attacks, as shown below, getting in behind City’s advanced full-backs may well be a more reliable attacking route for them — certainly away from home.\nWithout the electric Christopher Nkunku for the second leg because of a thigh injury – the Frenchman scored a hat-trick last time he played at the Etihad Stadium – it will be up to Timo Werner to pick up the attacking reins, following his sensational near-post drive in the 3-0 win over Borussia Monchengladbach at the weekend.\nThere are few players more adept at getting in behind – now would be the time to prove he has that clinical edge we saw little of in his Chelsea days.\nPorto vs Inter Milan\nFirst-leg result: Inter Milan 1-0 Porto\nPorto\nIn arguably the most finely-poised tie of the four, Sergio Conceicao’s Porto will be looking to make up for a wasteful first leg performance, in which they lost to a late Romelu Lukaku volley in Milan.\nThe Portuguese side battled well, accumulating 1.7 xG (expected goals) from their 10 shots on goal, and will be relishing the chance to make their Estadio do Dragao a cauldron as they look to claw back a slender, very attainable deficit.\nBefore losing the influential Otavio to a second yellow card, Iranian striker Mehdi Taremi probably should have given them the lead, seeing his close-range volley – which had an expected goals on target value of 0.82 – miraculously saved by a grounded Andre Onana.\nDespite that miss, Taremi continued to look incredibly dangerous around the penalty area and will certainly be Inter’s biggest headache tomorrow (Tuesday).\nOf all players in the Champions League this season, Porto’s No 9 has generated the highest individual xG tally of 5.5 (with penalties included). With nine chances created and 18 shots from inside the box alone, Taremi’s movement and awareness in tight spaces set him apart.\nAdvertisement\nIn the following example from the first leg, his desire to offer an option in behind – even when the opponents’ back line is so deep – shows his tireless work rate, darting in on the blindside of Alessandro Bastoni…\n…before producing a deft backheel to tee up Marko Grujic for the shot.\nWith elusive penalty box movement and alert, incisive decision-making, don’t be surprised to see Taremi make a mark on the second leg.\nInter Milan\nHaving watched their city rivals see out a 1-0 aggregate win over Tottenham in London last week in this round of 16, Inter will be desperate to defend their own one-goal lead and join them in the quarter-finals.\nIf it happens, it will be the first time in 17 years both Milan clubs have made it through to that stage of the Champions League.\nHakan Calhanoglu has played for both clubs very recently, but it’s in Inter colours that the Turkey international has really kicked on, quickly becoming a key creative component in Simone Inzaghi’s non-negotiable 3-5-2. An excellent tempo-setter who is very adept at retaining possession and moving his side up the pitch, Calhanoglu has developed into a quietly well-rounded midfielder, to go alongside his eye for the spectacular.\nAnnouncing his arrival on the European stage back in 2014 with an outrageous free kick against Borussia Dortmund, the 29-year-old certainly hasn’t lost his appetite for a long-range effort, as shown by his shot map since joining Inter two seasons ago.\n(If you’re struggling to see where he scored his fifth goal from, by the way, try looking to the corners…)\nMore importantly, though, with 17 assists to his name across the past two seasons – 11 of those coming from dead-ball deliveries – Calhanoglu’s wicked set-piece delivery has seen him retain an average of 3.0 shot-creating passes per 90 minutes this season.\nAdvertisement\nWith the prolific foul-winner Lautaro Martinez leading those precious breakaways, drawing four in the first leg, his deliveries could be a valuable pressure-reliever in northern Portugal tomorrow.\nParticularly after the weekend’s loss to Spezia – winning their first home league game for almost six months – the hosts will be looking to pounce.\nNapoli vs Eintracht Frankfurt\nFirst-leg result: Eintracht Frankfurt 0-2 Napoli\nNapoli\nWith an unassailable 18-point lead at the top of Serie A, along with what looks to be an unassailable lead in this tie, Napoli are on the verge of history.\nNot only are Luciano Spalletti’s side closing in on their first Serie A title in 33 years, but a first-leg 2-0 win in Germany leaves them just 90 minutes away from the club’s first-ever Champions League quarter-final.\nThe data suggests they should secure their place in the draw comfortably.\nHaving smothered their opponents away from home, accumulating 2.9 xG to their hosts’ 0.45 while having 70 per cent of the ball, Napoli welcome a faltering Frankfurt to a stadium where they have lost just one of their past 16 games, and thumped Liverpool and Juventus 4-1 and 5-1 respectively this term.\nEven after a recent defeat to Lazio took the wind out of their sails, the Italians should have enough to see this one through.\nAnd while there’s been plenty of admiration for the unstoppable duo of Victor Osimhen and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia of late, South Korean defender Kim Min-jae has been equally colossal at the back.\nAs well as making the second-most passes of any player in Europe’s top five leagues this season, the 26-year-old also maintains the second-highest tackle win rate against dribblers across the continent, with an astonishing 88.2 per cent of his tackle attempts ending with his side back in possession.\nSuch defensive abilities allowed Kim to completely annul the threat of the tricky Randal Kolo Muani in the first leg, with his five tackles, alongside a 100 per cent aerial duel win rate and a huge 125 passes, capping off another immense performance at the back.\nAdvertisement\nAn even remotely similar shift on Wednesday and Kim will be guiding Napoli safely through to the last eight.\nEintracht Frankfurt\nNot only do last season’s Europa League winners have two of the continent’s most terrifying attackers to contend with, but Frankfurt will be without their own as 16-goal Kolo Muani serves his suspension for a first-leg red card.\nAble to complete just 247 passes, their lowest tally of the season in the first leg, and mustering just nine touches in the Napoli box, things are looking rather bleak for their hopes of being in the quarter-final draw.\nWithout the France international to lead the line, much of the attacking impetus will be placed on 23-year-old Jesper Lindstrom, who is enjoying a fine second season in Germany after firing his hometown side Brondby to their first Danish Championship in 16 years.\nExpected to be working with slim pickings once again, Lindstrom’s ability to drive the ball forward and into dangerous areas will be crucial if Frankfurt are to pick up any scraps on the counter-attack.\nOnly two players in the Bundesliga have carried the ball into the opposition penalty area more often than the Dane this campaign, while his eight in the Champions League are more than double the total of any available team-mate.\nHaving seen their heroes reach the knockout stages of the Champions League for the first time since the old European Cup’s reinvention in 1995, Frankfurt fans can’t be too dismayed with this season’s European journey.\nSo long as it doesn’t get embarrassing in Naples, anyway.\nReal Madrid vs Liverpool\nFirst-leg result: Liverpool 2-5 Real Madrid\nReal Madrid\nFor a side so often in crisis, there quite simply is no other side like Champions League Real Madrid.\nDespite going two goals down at Anfield in the first leg, Carlo Ancelotti’s men scored five without reply to record a scarcely believable comeback win.\nAdvertisement\nSince then, however, they have dropped four points in their quest to catch Barcelona in the race for La Liga, either side of losing to their eternal rivals at home in the first leg of a Copa del Rey semi-final – falling into a mini-slump, effectively.\nAs always in this competition, though, Real Madrid have history on their side. Having progressed from 26 of their previous 27 Champions League/European Cup knockout ties following a first-leg away win, the competition’s 14-time winners have one foot and at least another toe in the quarter-finals already.\nDespite a handful of lacklustre performances in domestic competition of late, Federico Valverde has continued to shine.\nIn a 0-0 draw at Real Betis the weekend before last, the Uruguayan was almost uncontainable on the right side of a midfield three, charging into attacks down the right half-space and unleashing two incredible drives from distance to add to his collection of 34 outside-of-the-box shots this campaign.\nA revelation this season, Valverde’s unmatched ability of keeping blockbuster strikes under control has seen him over-perform his expected output by almost four goals — a remarkable improvement on his previous shooting seasons.\nAncelotti famously claimed he would retire if he couldn’t get the Uruguayan to score 10 goals in a season.\nAs Valverde will be aiming for his 13th of 2022-23 on Wednesday at the Bernabeu, the Italian can safely say he’s done his job.\nLiverpool\nIn the most extraordinary two-week period, Liverpool have been both bludgeoned and blessed by the xG gods.\nThat 5-2 defeat to the Spanish, European and world champions, in which their opponents overperformed their expected goal value by 3.4, has been followed up by a 4.2 over-performance of their own, dramatically putting seven past their fierce rivals Manchester United, before losing to the Premier League’s bottom club Bournemouth on Saturday.\nAdvertisement\nIn a first leg marred with defensive errors, goalkeeper Alisson conceded five goals for the first time ever in a Liverpool shirt and only the second time since he moved to Europe from Brazilian side Internacional in 2016.\nThe other time, you ask? Also a game that finished 5-2 at Anfield – this time to Liverpool, when Alisson was playing for Roma.\nIf Liverpool are to miraculously find a way back into this tie, this season’s Champions League top scorer Mohamed Salah is almost certainly going to have to play a starring role. The Egyptian has surged back into form, with two goals and two assists against United, and was one of few bright sparks for the home side in the opening leg.\nOf Liverpool’s touches this season, 40.4 per cent have come down their right-hand side in the Premier League (only Wolves have focused their attacks more intensely down that flank), with some encouraging triangles reemerging between Trent Alexander-Arnold, Harvey Elliott and Salah.\nAlready so far behind in this tie, Liverpool have an opportunity to let loose.\nIt’s not every day you beat Manchester United 7-0. It’s also not very often you have a free hit at the Santiago Bernabeu.\nWhichever way it goes, we’ll surely see goals.\n(Top photos: Getty Images)",
