Probably not. But everyone always likes to see, is he a winner or has he won a championship?\n\"So if you want to call it a monkey off the back, whatever, it doesn't really faze me, but I'm rapt.\"\nThe former Socceroos captain's early days as Adelaide United coach included coaching a young Mathew Leckie and taking the Reds to an Asian Champions League Final and ALM decider.\nBut those achievements were arguably overshadowed by Vidmar's outbursts, which included calling Adelaide \"a pissant town\" and blaming \"politics\" for his team's 4-0 semi-final loss to Victory in 2009.\n\"Well, when you're young, you sometimes do some silly things,\" Vidmar, now 58, said with a laugh.\n\"You regret it when you get a little bit older, but sometimes you've got the passion, and those moments sort of just pop up and things happen.\n\"But it is what it is. I'm so rapt for everyone here, the players are really working their backsides off and really deserved that last night.\"\nVidmar hopes to keep most of his squad together, including Marco Tilio, whose loan from Celtic is ending.\nGrand final goal scorer Yonatan Cohen is off-contract.\nIn finishing second behind Auckland FC, City were the highest-ranked Australian team and qualified for the Asian Champions League Elite.\nVidmar noted that would help on the recruiting front as City attempt to stay at the top.\nHe can't wait to return to Asia after City flopped in the group stages in their last involvement in 2023.\n\"It's a great competition,\" he said.\n\"Some of those nights have been the most memorable nights in my football career and there's so much more respect for it than it used to be 10, 15 years ago.\n\"Now we've seen all the money that's been thrown out to the Saudis, for example; theirs are going to be strong. The Japanese are always going to be strong.\n\"So a great tournament. We deserve to get there. So looking forward to that. It's going to be special.\"\nAustralian Associated Press",
