Chance of starting regularly: Moderate.\nSamuel Chukwueze — AC Milan (Serie A)\nChukwueze endured an inconsistent first season at Milan, partly due to injuries.

While competition exists, his consistency last term suggests he will start most matches.

He will almost certainly retain his starting role under Marco Silva.

As the club’s leading striker, he will be central to their Champions League campaign.
