  "body_text": "Al-Nassr are being viewed as serious contenders to sign Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli, based on a report from journalist Ben Jacobs.\nThe Brazilian attacker has grown into one of Arsenal’s key forward players since his arrival, playing an important role across several seasons.\nDespite his status in the squad, there have been ongoing talks around Arsenal strengthening their left side with new attacking options.\nThose discussions have led to fresh reports suggesting Martinelli could become available if the club decide to reshape that area.\nArsenal open to changes on the left side\nThe report claims Arsenal are planning to sign a new left winger ahead of the 2026/27 season, as part of their long-term squad plans.\nAs a result, Arsenal are believed to be open to offers for Martinelli if the right proposal arrives. The club are said to be assessing their attacking options as they look to improve balance on the left-hand side.\nMartinelli has been a regular feature in the squad over the years, but competition in wide areas continues to grow.\nThis situation has opened the door for interest from clubs outside Europe, including teams from Saudi Arabia.\nAl-Nassr show serious interest\nAl-Nassr are now being mentioned as genuine contenders in the race to sign Martinelli, according to the same report.\nTheir interest comes at a time when Martinelli has endured a mixed start to the current league campaign.\nIn the Premier League, the winger has managed only one goal from 17 appearances so far this season.\nThose numbers represent a slower return compared to his previous league performances for the club.\nDuring the 2022/23 season, Martinelli scored 15 goals and added seven assists, demonstrating his quality at the highest level.\nHowever, his form in Europe has painted a very different picture this season. In the Champions League, Martinelli has scored five goals and added one assist for Arsenal.\nThat contrast has highlighted his continued ability to deliver on the big stage when chances arrive.\nDespite the uneven league form, Martinelli remains a player with strong attacking qualities and pace.\nMartinelli originally joined Arsenal from Ituano Futebol Clube back in 2019, beginning his journey in English football.\nSince then, he has developed into a recognised first-team player with experience at the highest level.",
