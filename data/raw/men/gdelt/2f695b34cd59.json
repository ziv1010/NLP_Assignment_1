  "body_text": "Brazil announce Carlo Ancelotti start date - despite hiring another new boss\nCarlo Ancelotti will become Brazil manager next summer, in time for the Copa America, after seeing out the final year of his contract with current employer Real Madrid\nCarlo Ancelotti will become the manager of Brazil next summer when his Real Madrid contract expires.\nAncelotti has been strongly linked with the Brazil job and Brazilian Football Confederation president Ednaldo Rodrigues has now announced the plan. In an intriguing move, Fluminense boss Fernando Diniz has been appointed on a 12-month contract and will then make way for Ancelotti in June 2024.\nThe Italian has never managed an international side before but will join the Selecao ahead of the Copa America in the United States. Real Madrid are yet to comment on the news, which Rodrigues announced on Wednesday.\n“His (Diniz’s) game plan is almost similar to that of the coach that will take over at Copa America, Ancelotti,” he said. “We won't call him an interim coach of the national team. He will come and make the transition in Brazil for Ancelotti.”\nREAD MORE: Transfer news LIVE: Arsenal make Rice breakthrough, Man Utd bid incoming, more Chelsea exitsREAD MORE: David Beckham's private text to Jude Bellingham after big-money Real Madrid transferDiniz will take charge of the Brazil national team while also continuing in his role with Fluminense. Ancelotti had been under pressure at Real following their 4-0 thrashing by Manchester City in the Champions League semi-final second leg in May, but he has kept hold of his job.\n“I have a contract until June 2024 and the club has already guaranteed I will see out my contract. Everyone knows that’s exactly what I want to do,” he said at the time, emphasising that he had the backing of club president Florentino Perez.\n“We spoke yesterday, as we do most weeks. We had a meeting, assessed the match and he showed me his affection and support,” he said. “We also spoke about the last couple of seasons and we will continue moving forward with the same or greater hunger to do a good job.”\nIf he gets through the 2023/24 season without being sacked, Ancelotti’s time at Real will end on one of two dates. The LaLiga season is scheduled to finish on May 26, while the Champions League final is on June 1. With the Copa America beginning on June 20, he will not have much time to switch roles.\nDiniz is excited to keep the seat warm for Ancelotti in the meantime. \"I’ve worked with some of the players when they were younger, Bruno Guimaraes and Antony, for example,” he said.\n“I have followed the growth of that entire generation a lot. I was also an adversary of some and I have ended up admiring many others playing in Brazil and abroad in Europe.”\nSpeaking in June, Neymar made it clear that Ancelotti would have the backing of the Brazil squad. “We all know him, we know how amazing he is,” he said. “To have him in the team would be very important. But there is nothing confirmed as of yet. We hope that he comes after his contract ends.”",
