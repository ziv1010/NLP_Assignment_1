  "body_text": "From Paul Breitner’s equaliser in the 1974 World Cup final to Andreas Brehme’s 1990 winner, countless shootout triumphs and Michael Kutzop’s iconic miss in 1986, penalties have played an outsized role in German football history.\nAnd now there is a good chance a first non-penalty will make the canon as well — Sascha Stegemann’s refusal to blow the whistle when Karim Adeyemi was fouled by Danilo Soares in the box on Friday night could well go down as the decisive moment in the most memorable title race in over a decade.\nAdvertisement\nBochum and Borussia Dortmund were tied 1-1 in the “little” Ruhr derby and the away team were pushing for the lead. Julian Brandt put in a low cross in the 65th minute that Adeyemi and Soares failed to connect with but hang on — was the Germany forward not wiped out by the defender’s clumsy challenge in the process? Stegemann didn’t think so. Neither did the VAR. The Bundesliga official highlights video sheepishly omits the controversy altogether but have a look here. Soares was already on a booking, too.\nAfter Dortmund had gone on to miss a few more good chances and seen a last-minute shout for a handball in the box turned down, their players and officials were predictably outraged. They could have opened up a four-point lead before Bayern Munich’s home game against Hertha Berlin on Sunday.\n“We’ve looked at ourselves in recent weeks and not pointed fingers at others. But today, the referee decided the game,” said Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl. The 43-year-old’s complaints included a possible push on Emre Can before Anthony Losilla’s dreamy fifth-minute opener but he was mostly upset by Stegemann’s failure to go over to the monitor.\n“There are five games to go, it’s a decisive moment for the championship. It’s negligent, cowardly and completely wrong not to make use of the technology and have a second look,” Kehl said, and darkly hinted at bias from the officials.\n“I don’t want to know what would have happened if Bayern Munich had played here. Things were dodgy.”\nMats Hummels used more moderate language and made the salient point that Dortmund would have still needed to convert the spot kick, but he, too, found the decision itself baffling. “I can’t understand why there are tons of dubious penalties but VAR didn’t intervene in one of the most obvious situations in recent years,” Dortmund’s veteran defender wrote on Instagram.\nAdvertisement\nStegemann, to his credit, admitted his error in a series of interviews after a sleepless night. He explained that he had mistakenly thought Adeyemi had initiated the contact and he revealed the VAR had not found ”clear and obvious” enough reasons to recommend a review.\n“There was no signal from (the VAR centre in) Cologne, and protests from the players were muted. I didn’t have any doubts on the pitch. But it would have been very helpful to check the situation on the monitor.”\nThe affair once again exposed the tension of how the VAR system is applied in Germany. Although players and supporters want to keep disruption at a minimum and support a high threshold for VARs getting involved, the relatively frequent use of the monitor by referees in recent seasons has raised expectations that complex and crucial decisions will be reviewed.\nIt is hard to reconcile both ideas, especially as long as ”clear and obvious” continues to be such a nebulous concept. Would 99 out of 100 experts have to agree that a decision was categorically wrong to urge a rethink? Or is it enough for three out of 10 to be unsure that the referee got it right?\nIn Adeyemi’s case, VAR Robert Hartmann applied strict criteria, deciding that there was just enough uncertainty to stick with the original call. Stegemann and the German FA (DFB) disagreed, however.\n“The defender lunges into the tackle with both feet and only connects with the opponent, it’s a foul and a penalty,” the DFB said. “It’s to be expected that referees will decide such matters correctly on the pitch, without the need for support from the VAR.”\nAnd that is the crux of the matter… Stegemann should have seen the foul in real-time. When he did not, the VAR should, at least, have told him to check again. In all probability, the refereeing team would have arrived at a better decision as a result.\nAdvertisement\nSadly, some idiots cannot countenance human error. Stegemann and his family reported violent threats to the police over the weekend, and there has been talk of him being put under protection. He is now wondering about taking a break, too. Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke, who is the DFB’s vice-president and an executive board member of the Bundesliga, has issued a statement in support.\n“Hostilities of any kind, disparagement or threats, whether in person or anonymously via social media channels, are not something that we can even begin to tolerate,” the 63-year-old said.\nAs much as traditionalists bemoan the perceived loss of immediate emotions in the age of VARs, the angry and, at times, deranged reactions to officials’ decisions show that referees do need all the help they can get. They and the technology they use receive no credit whatsoever for the thousands of correct calls across a season.\nBut the undeniably lower rate of error for key situations — such as penalties or offsides — since the introduction of TV reviews has only made everyone less accepting of the odd clanger that does get through.\nIt is naive, bordering on irresponsible, to believe that in a VAR-less utopia, supporters and players would simply accept grave mistakes as a reasonable price to pay for keeping celebrations inside the ground spontaneous.\nFor Dortmund, lamenting sinister interference by higher powers might temporarily soothe their wounded souls. If their title challenges does falter, the “Adeyemi pen” will surely echo in infamy in Westphalia.\nBut deep down, Edin Terzic and his players must admit to themselves that winning a game against their relegation-contesting neighbours should not have come down to a bit of refereeing misfortune. Faced with an historic opportunity to wrest control of the Meisterschale from a wavering Bayern, they were first and foremost sloppy for allowing themselves to get unlucky.\nAdvertisement\nOver in Munich, by contrast, there was an air of relief (maybe even celebration) after their 2-0 win over Hertha saw them leapfrog Dortmund at the top. “We will win that thing, write that down,” a happy Thomas Muller shouted at reporters in the Allianz Arena mixed zone.\nBayern had made painfully hard work of the match against the spirited, bottom-placed visitors, betraying low levels of confidence once more. On the plus side, they scored two finely worked goals (Serge Gnabry and Kingsley Coman) and controlled proceedings throughout.\n“We kept our shape and our heads,” said Joshua Kimmich, which is more than could have been said about the disappointments in recent weeks. With momentum in the title race back on their side, the unseemly power wrangle in the boardroom can take a breather. Still, it was noticeable how club president Herbert Hainer did not back chief executive Oliver Kahn after the final whistle.\nThe former goalkeeper has been heavily damaged by speculation about his imminent dismissal. Winning the league aside, his best hope is that the supervisory board will fail to come up with a viable replacement in time for their meeting on May 22.\nAn 11th straight title by Bavaria’s finest soap opera ensemble would be greeted with limited excitement but there is an argument that the Bundesliga’s anachronistic ‘organic growth’ model has never been more vindicated than this year: traditional members’ clubs Union Berlin (who drew 0-0 at home to Bayer Leverkusen) and Freiburg (a 1-0 win in Cologne) are in the top four and close to gate-crashing next season’s Champions League without selling a single share to outside investors.\nThe duo’s unlikely success has been made possible by formidable trade-craft — clever scouting and top coaching — but is reliant on comparable sides not taking shortcuts to the top through easy money.\nAt the less fragrant end of the table, Schalke have given themselves a chance of getting out of trouble after all. Liverpool loanee Sepp van den Berg, back from a six-month injury lay-off, and Dominick Drexler won the game against Werder Bremen 2-1 with two goals in the last 10 minutes, prompting a severe outbreak of ‘limbs’ in royal blue colours at the Veltins-Arena.\nAdvertisement\n“The supporters carried us to victory — this can give us new energy in the relegation battle,” said Schalke coach Thomas Reis.\nHis surprisingly resilient Schalke side are just one point behind the relegation play-off spot, which is occupied by Bochum, and two off outright safety (given 15th-placed Stuttgart’s superior goal difference). The miracle is on.\n(Main image: Jude Bellingham and Emre Can lead the Dortmund protests. Photo: Federico Gambarini/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
