The INEOS chairman has assumed responsibility for all football operations inside the club.\nTen Hag a dead man walking as INEOS target fresh start\nRatcliffe has already made his presence felt inside Old Trafford, appointing Omar Berrada as the club’s new chief executive in a major coup from local rivals Manchester City.\nUnited have also made a move for Newcastle United sporting director Dan Ashworth, who was recently placed on gardening leave by the Magpies after signalling his intention to leave.\nWith results still inconsistent, TEAMtalk can reveal that Ten Hag is now regarded as a dead man walking by club insiders with the Dutchman likely to be relieved of his duties at the end of the season.\nSources suggest Ratcliffe’s new regime is keen to appoint a new man in the summer, with some players no longer believing in Ten Hag and his methods.\nSpeaking recently to selected media, Ratcliffe stopped short of giving his full backing to Ten Hag – claiming it would be “inappropriate” to comment on his future.\nHe said: “I’m not going to comment on Erik ten Hag because it would be inappropriate to do that.\n“But if you look at the 11 years that have gone since David Gill and Sir Alex Ferguson have stepped down, there have been a whole series of coaches, some of which were very good.\n“And none of them were successful, or survived for very long.\n“And you can’t blame all the coaches. The only conclusion you can draw is that the environment in which they were working didn’t work.”\nManchester United are due to face Man City on Sunday in what could prove to be another nail in his managerial coffin at Old Trafford.",
