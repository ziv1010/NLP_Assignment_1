He penned a one-year contract extension last season, and his deal at St James’ Park is set to expire next summer.\nAccording to Shields Gazzette, Newcastle are not planning to offer the 31-year-old another extension and are ‘could be tempted’ to accept a cut-price sale in January to avoid losing him on a free transfer.\nThe report claims that Danish side FC Copenhagen, who compete in the Champions League, are interested in signing Krafth, and the Swedish international could be interested in a move closer to home.\nKrafth joined Newcastle in 2019 from French side Amiens. He has made 106 appearances for the Tynesiders, with the latest coming in the 3-1 defeat to West Ham in the Premier League last weekend, as he deputised for Kieran Trippier, who was sidelined due to illness.\nREAD MORE ⚫⚪ Newcastle complete massive signing coup as three Premier League rivals brushed aside\nNewcastle will consider selling star in January\nWhile Krafth has been in and around the squad this term, the reality is that the majority of his involvement has been limited to cameos off the bench.\nNewcastle have other right-back options in Trippier and Tino Livramento, so it makes sense for them to sell Krafth and get some money for him while they can.\nKrafth’s start against West Ham was his only one in the Premier League so far this season.\nLivramento has been heavily linked with a move to Manchester City, but with his contract running until 2028, Newcastle are in a strong position to keep the 22-year-old right-back.\nLivramento has been out since October with a knee injury. There is hope of a return relatively soon – but should that issue persist then Howe could opt to keep Krafth beyond January.\nBut Copenhagen are reportedly primed to strike and lure the defender away from St James’ Park this winter.\nDON’T MISS 👉 Liverpool aim to capitalise on Newcastle ‘delay’ for star as Magpies speed up ‘priority’ call\nGet the inside story first by joining our TEAMtalk Facebook channel to receive the latest breaking and exclusive news straight into your Messenger inbox.",
