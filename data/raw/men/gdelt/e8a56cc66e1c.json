FourFourTwo, meanwhile, understands that Quenda is the most likely of Sporting's stars to follow Amorim to Old Trafford.\nQuenda is worth €30m, as per Transfermarkt. Manchester United take on Tottenham this weekend as Premier League action returns.\nJames Ridge is a freelance journalist based in the UK.
