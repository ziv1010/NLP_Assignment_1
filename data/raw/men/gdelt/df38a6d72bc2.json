Back in 2015/16 season, they were beaten by eventual winners Real Madrid in the semis.\nIn the 2020/21 season, they managed to beat Paris Saint-Germain to reach the final, where they played Chelsea.\nIn the 2022/23 season, they beat Real Madrid easily in the semifinal, 5-1 on aggregate, to book their place in the final.\nHow many times have Man City won the Champions League?\nBig European nights at the Etihad Stadium\nMan City’s Etihad Stadium is the place to be on European nights. The atmosphere created by the fans, who always feel that their team are going to win, is a sight to behold.\nThe stadium has a capacity of 53,400, filled completely with the fans to witness some of the best players in the world.\nThey have experienced some of the best European matches at this stadium.\nFrom the classic 4-3 win against Bayern Munich in 2013, inspired by Sergio Aguero to the 5-3 win against Monaco of Kylian Mbappe and Radamel Falcao, City have always managed to put on a show for their fans when they play at home.\nHowever, the best Champions League match that the Man City faithful have experienced at home is the semifinal of the 2022/23 season against Real Madrid.\nMan City won the match 4-0, completely outclassing their opponents with their attacking skill and their tactical superiority. Not many teams have been able to do that to Real Madrid.\nBUY TICKETS FOR MAN CITY VS INTER MILAN\nThree Man City players to watch in the Champions League this season\nErling Haaland\nJust like the water is wet and the sky is blue, Erling Haaland scores goals. He was born to score goals and in Man City, he has found the perfect team to showcase his talent to the best of his ability.\nWhether it is the Champions League or the Premier League, Haaland knows where the back of the net is. Pep Guardiola’s team heavily rely on him to score the goals for them and he answers their call most of the times.\nHis record on the European stage is phenomenal, not only for the Sky Blues but also for his former clubs.\nKevin De Bruyne\nThe Belgian midfielder makes Man City tick. He creates opportunities for his teammates with his passes, crosses and the runs he makes.\nHis ability to score from anywhere is something that has helped the Premier League club win crucial matches in the competition.\nNow De Bruyne has the experience of winning the competition, he will once again be crucial for them if they want to win the prestigious trophy.\nRodri\nThere are two Man City sides, one with Rodri and one without Rodri, that is how important he is. He is their midfield commander who not only supports them in attack and but also while defending.\nRodri is one of the best readers of the game and his ability to control the tempo of the match with his passing is massively underrated.\nAfter scoring the winner in the final back in 2023, he will be hoping to go all the way again with the Sky Blues this season.",
