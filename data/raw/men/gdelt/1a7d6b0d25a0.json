  "body_text": "Liverpool vs Real Madrid LIVE score: Champions League result as Real come from two goals down to win\nLiverpool resume their Champions League campaign with a difficult test in the round of 16 when they take on holders Real Madrid. This clash is a repeat of the 2022 final which saw Carlo Ancelotti’s men lift the trophy after a heart-breaking 1-0 victory over the Reds.\nJurgen Klopp’s side have a poor record against the Spanish champions. They have not beaten Real Madrid in any of the last six meetings - a run which dates back to March 2009. During this time Liverpool have managed just one draw, a goalless affair in the 2021 quarter-final second leg, which saw Madrid progress through the round after a 3-1 victory at the Bernabeu.\nYet, this match comes at a decent time for Liverpool. Klopp’s men have recorded back-to-back wins for the first time this year and their forward trio of Mo Salah, Darwin Nunez, and Cody Gakpo seems to finally be clicking. Madrid, meanwhile, are on a four-game winning run which has seen them win the Fifa Club World Cup following a 5-3 victory over Al-Hilal. They are in confident form and will be targeting consecutive Champions League wins with Barcelona eight points clear at the top of La Liga.\nCan Liverpool defeat the Champions League winners at Anfield?\nFollow all the action as the last-16 knockout stages get underway:\nLiverpool vs Real Madrid\nLiverpool host Real Madrid in Champions League last-16\nFixture is a repeat of 2022 Champions League final which Madrid won 1-0\n47’ GOAL! - Militao powers Real Madrid into the lead (LIV 2-3 RMA)\n36 GOAL! - An error from Alisson gives Vinicius his second of the night (LIV 2-2 RMA)\n30’ SAVE! - Alisson leaps across to deny Vinicius Jr (LIV 2-1 RMA)\n21’ GOAL! - Vinicius Jr pulls one back for the visitors (LIV 2-1 RMA)\n14’ GOAL! - Salah pounces on Courtois’ mistake (LIV 2-0 RMA)\n4’ GOAL! - Nunez backheels Liverpool in the lead (LIV 1-0 RMA)\nLiverpool FC 2 - 5 Real Madrid CF\nFT Liverpool 2- 5 Real Madrid\n22:00 , Michael Jones\nFull-time: Liverpool 2- 5 Real Madrid\n21:57 , Michael Jones\n90+3 mins: It’s all over at Anfield.

Nunez goes down as the ball bounces over his head hoping for a penalty.\nThe referee plays on and VAR doesn’t even check the incident.\nLiverpool 2- 3 Real Madrid\n21:12 , Michael Jones\n50 mins: Now Liverpool have things to think about.

There is nothing in the world that could justify that. Imagine if I say yes, that would be completely insane.”\n‘Nothing in the world could justify that’: Klopp decries racist abuse of Vinicius Jr\nLiverpool vs Real Madrid\n19:30 , Michael Jones\nLiverpool are winless in their last six matches against Real Madrid, drawing one and losing five. Those five defeats include the 2018 and 2022 finals.\nThe Reds had actually won their previous three meetings between 1981 and 2009.\nLiverpool vs Real Madrid\n19:25 , Michael Jones\nIf Jordan Henderson features he will enter the list of the Reds’ top 10 appearance makers in Europe, joining Phil Neal on 74 matches.\nLiverpool owner John W Henry insists FSG are not selling Premier League club\n19:20 , Michael Jones\nLiverpool owner John W Henry said the Merseyside club is not for sale now.\nHenry and Fenway Sports Group had revealed in November that the club was on the market but now it is more likely they get a minority investor. The American consortium are in talks with possible partners.\nFSG bought Liverpool for £300 million in 2010 and may have been looking for £4 billion to sell the club but, unlike Manchester United, they are not thought to have received any concrete offers and will now concentrate on finding someone to purchase a smaller share of the club.\nHenry told the Boston Sports Journal: “I know there has been a lot of conversation and quotes about LFC, but I keep to the facts: we merely formalised an ongoing process.\n“Will we be in England forever?

No,” Henry told the Boston Sports Journal. “Are talking with investors about LFC? Yes. Will something happen there? I believe so, but it won’t be a sale.”\nSalah closing on Liverpool record\n19:10 , Michael Jones\nMo Salah is one goal away from becoming Liverpool’s outright top scorer of all time in European competition.\nCurrently level with Steven Gerrard on 41, the Egyptian will move clear in the history books if he nets in Tuesday night’s Champions League tie with Real Madrid at Anfield.\nLiverpool’s Cody Gakpo relishing chance to prove himself in the Champions League\n19:05 , Michael Jones\nLiverpool’s January signing Cody Gakpo admits he still has to prove himself in the Champions League.\nThe 23-year-old may have played in a World Cup quarter-final against eventual champions Argentina but his experience in Europe’s elite club competition extends to just seven minutes in one substitute appearance in a group-stage draw against Tottenham in October 2018.\nGakpo had struggled with his form since arriving from PSV Eindhoven for an initial £37m last month – not helped by Liverpool’s struggles on the pitch as a team – but the Netherlands international has now scored in back-to-back matches against Everton and Newcastle.\nAnd his first Champions League start could be in the last-16, first-leg tie at home to Real Madrid.\nLiverpool’s Cody Gakpo relishing chance to prove himself in the Champions League\nLiverpool’s previous defeats\n19:00 , Michael Jones\nLiverpool have bad memories of facing Real Madrid in the Champions League:\n2022 - Real Madrid beat Liverpool 2-0 in the final.\n2021 - Real Madrid beat Liverpool 3-1 on aggregate in the quarters.\n2018 - Real Madrid beat Liverpool 3-1 in the final.\n2014 - Real Madrid beat Liverpool 3-0 and 1-0 in the group stages.\nCan the Reds finally get one over on the Spanish champions tonight?\nLiverpool vs Real Madrid\n18:55 , Michael Jones\nTonight’s venue.

We didn’t for the one reason: that we didn’t score and conceded. But apart from that, we should have won this game.\n“Carlo is the most relaxed manager I ever met in my life, one of the best people you can meet – fantastic person, humble person, super-smart and nice.\n“Obviously his man-management is a completely different level to all of us and I respect that a lot, I admire that a lot. So yes, with this world-class team, which they were last year, brought in super-exciting young players.\n“Maybe [they] struggle a bit in the league – I don’t know if you can call that struggling, but Barcelona is just a few points ahead – but apart from that, they are always super, super-competitive and super-difficult to beat.\n“So, this combination is a difficult one – that’s true – but I think it makes absolute sense to try it anyway.”\nCarlo Ancelotti says Real Madrid’s Vinicius is fully focused on Liverpool game\n18:45 , Michael Jones\nReal Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti believes Vinicius Jr is fully focused on football despite being targeted with racist abuse, and backed him to show his quality against Liverpool once again on Tuesday.\nThe Brazil international, who has scored three goals in his last three meetings with Jurgen Klopp’s side – including the winner in May’s Champions League final – has found himself the subject of sickening insults in Spain.\nIt has included a mannequin wearing the player’s shirt being hung from a bridge outside Madrid’s training ground last month.

A 4-1 defeat to Napoli in their opening group game meant that Jurgen Klopp’s men were not only searching for wins but big ones at that.\nAfter four consecutive victories, against Ajax and Rangers (home and away), the Reds notched up an impressive goal difference but Napoli matched them every step of the way.\nThe final group game was played between the two teams with Liverpool needing to win 4-0 to overtake the Italian side at the top for Group A. Klopp’s side could only manage a 2-0 victory which sent them through to the knockout stages in second place and means they now have to face Real Madrid in the last-16.\nLiverpool vs Real Madrid\n18:30 , Michael Jones\nThe last time Liverpool defeated Real Madrid at Anfield, Fernando Torres, Steven Gerrard (x2) and Andrea Dossena all scored in a 4-0 romp for the home side.\nHere are the highlights from that game in 2009:\nA special Anfield night against Real Madrid in 2009 ✨⏪#LIVRMA | #UCL pic.twitter.com/bQE4p1b19T\n— Liverpool FC (@LFC) February 21, 2023\nJurgen Klopp on facing Real Madrid\n18:25 , Michael Jones\nLiverpool have a bit of history with Real Madrid. They have not beaten the Spanish giants in six games, two of which were Champions League finals.\nJurgen Klopp was asked whether Liverpool’s poor run of form against Madrid would come into play tonight and he replied:\n“Different things happened to us with Real Madrid. If you want, to me; at Dortmund I had already a Real Madrid story. One of the biggest clubs in the world, one of the most successful clubs for sure, won this competition I don’t know how often. Super-experienced.\n“In our own story, just recently if you want, we played this final in Paris and I didn’t watch it back since then – until this weekend. The thing I realised immediately: now I know why I didn’t watch it back. But I had to and it was proper torture because we played a good game and we could have won the game, and that’s the decisive word: we could. We didn’t, they scored the decisive goal and we didn’t, that was the reason.\n“You could see in this game how experienced Madrid is, how little they are fussed when the other team has chances. They don’t lose confidence in one second, they know, ‘Our chance will come’, they are there for that and they defend with legs, deep defending together. So, this is this team and that’s the competition and that’s what you can learn from them, definitely.\n“But that’s seven, eight months ago. Before that, the last time when they knocked us out, we played there on the training ground and here in an empty stadium. Here the game was really good, it was a really good 0-0 where we let them run, let me say it like this, we let them work hard for the money and that was good.\n“But this is now different teams. Same clubs, different teams, different times. There’s a history. In the last few years one of us was kind of always in the final, that’s how it feels at least.\n“And usually if you want to go to the final it’s always you have to kick us out or them. This time we play each other, so let’s see who can go through.”\nThe ‘proper torture’ Jurgen Klopp endured to prepare for Real Madrid rematch\n18:20 , Michael Jones\nJurgen Klopp subjected himself to a video nasty recently, watching back one of Liverpool’s defeats. “It was proper torture,” he said. He was not talking about the 2023 losses to Brentford, Brighton and Wolves, matches that could rank among the worst of his reign at Liverpool.\nInstead, the torturous element was the sense that his side did a lot right. Reliving the 2022 Champions League final for the first time was a different sort of agony. “We played a good game and could have won the game – and that’s the decisive word because we could but didn’t, because they scored and we didn’t, and that’s the decisive reason,” he said.\nKlopp, the great proponent of heavy-metal football, watched it with the sound off, immersed in his thoughts, sat on his own. “Unfortunately,” he said. “There was a feeling of here and there and with an extra spark we could have made this thing [happen].”\nHe felt his team were too cautious at times. “We did not take enough risks in little moments, we were not adventurous enough,” he explained. With a bit more boldness, Liverpool could have pulled off a historic cup treble.\nInstead, he remains a one-time Champions League winner. It puts him three behind the nonpareil Carlo Ancelotti. A rematch with Real Madrid may not be a revenge mission, but it feels like a clash of opposites. Perhaps Real are Liverpool’s kryptonite.\nKlopp’s brand of football, after all, is based on the speed and intensity to create chaos. And then there is Real, the veterans who play the game at their own pace, who seem utterly unworried when trailing or dominated, a side with the personality of the managerial king of cool.\nThe ‘proper torture’ Jurgen Klopp endured to prepare for Real Madrid rematch\nLiverpool vs Real Madrid prediction\n18:15 , Michael Jones\nSaturday’s performance against Newcastle will provide Jurgen Klopp’s side with a much-needed confidence boost ahead of this crunch tie.\nStefan Bajcetic will face a huge task in central midfield against vastly experienced opposition, while Liverpool’s defence will have to work hard against a pacy and clinical Real Madrid front line.\nUltimately, these fine margins might make the difference in this clash between two European heavyweights.\nLiverpool 1- 2 Real Madrid.\nReal Madrid starting line-up\n18:13 , Michael Jones\nReal Madrid XI: Courtois, Carvajal, Militao, Rudiger, Alaba, Camavinga, Modric, Valverde, Rodrygo, Benzema, Vinicius Jr\n📋✅ Our starting XI 🆚 @LFC!#UCL pic.twitter.com/MhzLE0v6II\n— Real Madrid C.F. 🇬🇧🇺🇸 (@realmadriden) February 21, 2023\nLiverpool vs Real Madrid predicted line-ups\n18:10 , Michael Jones\nLiverpool: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson; Bajcetic, Fabinho, Henderson; Salah, Gakpo, Jota\nReal Madrid: Courtois; Carvajal, Militao, Rudiger, Alaba; Ceballos, Modric, Valverde; Rodrygo, Benzema, Vinicius Junior\nWhat is the early team news?\n18:05 , Michael Jones\nLuis Diaz, Ibrahima Konate, Thiago Alcantara and Calvin Ramsay are confirmed absentees for Liverpool. Arthur Melo remains a doubt as he continues to recover from a long-term thigh injury which hasn’t seen the midfielder play since Liverpool’s 4-1 loss to Napoli in the group stages.\nNunez was forced off before the hour mark against Newcastle on the weekend with a shoulder injury, with Klopp saying there is “a chance” the Uruguayan will feature in Tuesday’s clash.\nThe visitors will be without Mariano Diaz and Ferland Mendy with the pair out with long-term injuries. Ancelotti confirmed that Dani Carvajal has fully recovered from a lingering muscle injury and will be available while neither Toni Kroos nor Aurelien Tchouameni will feature having missed Madrid’s weekend game through illness.\nKarim Benzema also missed the game against Osasuna but is also expected to return for the midweek fixture.\nHow to watch Liverpool vs Real Madrid\n18:00 , Michael Jones\nThe match will kick off at 8pm on Tuesday, 21 January at Anfield.\nThe match will be available for fans to watch on BT Sport 1 and BT Sport Ultimate. Coverage starts on both at 7pm.\nLiverpool vs Real Madrid\n16:46 , Michael Jones\nGood evening and welcome to The Independent’s coverage of tonight’s Champions League action as Liverpool host Real Madrid in the first leg of their last-16 clash.\nThis fixture kicks off at 8pm and is a repeat of the 2022 final when Madrid defeated Liverpool 1-0 in Paris thanks to Vinicius Junior’s second half strike. Thibaut Courtois was named player of the match that night due to his incredible display between the sticks and he’ll be hoping to repeat that performance at Anfield tonight.\nReal Madrid have had an indifferent campaign in La Liga this season - for their standards anyway - and find themselves trailing Barcelona by eight points in the league. That means Carlo Ancelotti is likely to focus on European football as Madrid’s best chance of collecting silverware. They’re unbeaten in six matches against Liverpool, last losing to the Reds in March 2009, and will be confident of defeating Jurgen Klopp’s men once again.\nLiverpool’s domestic season has been equally underwhelming. They are eighth in the Premier League and trying to get into the race for the top four but only a run of victories will see them achieve that. Another possibility of securing European football next season is by winning the Champions League. That won’t be easy but Klopp’s team have won back-to-back games for the first time this year and have built a bit of momentum going into their biggest match of 2023 so far. Can they finally defeat Real Madrid?",
