No England team has ever previously enjoyed such a deep run.\nWednesday 23 July 2025 03:21, UK\nWhen all seems lost, these Lionesses find a way to rescue it.\nThe comebacks queens, always coming back for more.\nAnd now into a third consecutive final with a chance to defend their European crown.\nBut even Sarina Wiegman feared they would be flying home today when the clock hit 88 minutes in the semi-final with Italy and they were still trailing 1-0.\nJust why had the defence been picked apart too easily again in the first half to concede to give Barbara Bonansea the space and time to score?\nJust why were Alessia Russo and Lauren Hemp, in particular, not clinical enough?\nJust why are they always relying on the substitutes?\nMaybe that is a recipe for success rather than a desperate rescue mission.\nRead more from Sky News:\nTop global banker sounds warning to Reeves on tax and regulation\nOzzy Osbourne's life in pictures\nBecause when Wiegman saw there would be seven minutes of stoppage time, suddenly there was hope again.\nEspecially as five minutes earlier, the manager had brought on Michelle Agyemang.\nIt's a lot to rely on a 19-year-old. But this is a striker who scored 41 seconds into her international debut as a substitute in April.\nAnd she scored the equaliser that sent the quarterfinal into extra time last week before England beat Sweden on penalties.\nNow the weight of the nation was on her shoulders again - and she delivered in the sixth of the seven minutes of injury time.\n\"She has something special,\" Wiegman said. \"She's very mature, she knows exactly what she has to do.\n\"When you talk about little things that she picks up straight away, because she's not only in the 18-yard box very dangerous but when we have to go to her as a target player, she keeps the ball really well too.\"\nThe Arsenal forward even hit the crossbar in extra time before the Wembley winner from the final three years ago showed again why she's a super-sub.\nJust when it seemed England would need to win another shootout, Beth Mead was brought down and now they had one penalty to win it.\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\nChloe Kelly was denied but alert to pounce on the rebound.\nAnd with a 2-1 win, England will go the distance for a third tournament in a row. No England team has ever previously enjoyed such a deep run.\nFor Kelly it will be a second final of the year after winning the Champions League with Arsenal.\nBut it is a year that began despondent at Manchester City before securing a move to the Gunners.\n\"The moments when in January I felt like giving up football makes you so grateful for these moments here today, and this makes you enjoy every minute of that,\" Kelly said.\n\"I think confidence comes from within, but from around you as well. The players that we stand side by side with on the pitch, give confidence in each other.\"\nAnd England will certainly feel confident.\nThese Lionesses never give in. How many teams would want to bottle up that fighting spirit and resilience?\n\"When it finishes like this I am enjoying it but it's a little bit dramatic,\" said Wiegman, who has now reached an unprecedented five tournament finals with the Netherlands and England.",
