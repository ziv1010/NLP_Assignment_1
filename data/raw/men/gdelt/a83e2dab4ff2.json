Use a VPN to watch the Premier League with your subscription from anywhere.\nDespite there being a lot of concern about the lack of investment in the Wolves squad and Julen Lopetegui leaving just days before the start of the new season, Wolves impressed at Old Trafford for their opening game. While they lost 1-0, they had much better chances and should even had been awarded a penalty in the final of the game.\nThe signs are certainly encouraging if one game is anything to go by, but they'll face Brighton who comfortably swept aside Luton 4-1 at the Amex in their first match. Picking up where they left off last season, Brighton dominated the game with plenty of possession, shots and chances created. Wolves could be in for a tough afternoon if they fail to turn up.\nKick-off is at 3pm BST. Make sure you know how to watch the Premier League wherever you are.\nTeam news\nWolves' new manager Gary O'Neil has a fully fit for his first home game in charge.\nFor Brighton, Adam Webster has been declared fit and starts. Billy Gilmour also returns and Adam Lallana makes the bench. Jakub Moder remains out with a knee injury.\nWolves XI: Jose Sa; Nelson Semedo, Dawson, Kilman, Ait-Nouri; Pedro Neto, Joao Gomes, Lemina, Nunes; Fabio Silva, Matheus Cunha\nBrighton XI: Steele; Milner, Webster, Dunk, Estupinan; Gross, Gilmour; March, Enciso, Mitoma; Welbeck\nForm\nWolves: L\nBrighton: W\nReferee\nAndy Madley will be the referee for Wolves vs Brighton.

Peter Bankes is the VAR, with Steve Meredith the assistant VAR.\nStadium\nWolves vs Brighton will be played at Molineux in Wolverhampton, which has a capacity of 32,050.\nKick-off and channel\nWolves vs Brighton kick-off is at 3pm BST on Saturday 19 August in the UK.

See below for international broadcast options.\nVPN guide\nUse a VPN to watch Premier League football from outside your country\nIf you’re out of the country for a Premier League fixture, then you won't be able to watch on your domestic streaming service as usual. The broadcaster knows where you are because of your IP address (boo!) and blocks you from watching it. You can use a VPN to get around that, though, without resorting to illegal feeds you’ve found on Reddit.\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN), assuming it complies with your broadcaster’s T&Cs, creates a private connection between your device and t'internet, meaning the service can’t work out where you are and will let you watch. And all the info going between is entirely encrypted, anonymous and safe – and that's a result.\nThere are plenty of good-value options out there. For the Premier League, FourFourTwo currently recommends:\nExpressVPN including a 30-day, money-back guarantee\nFourFourTwo’s brainy office mates TechRadar love its super speedy connections, trustworthy security and the fact it works with Android, Apple, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, PS5 and loads more. You also get a money-back guarantee, 24/7 support and it's currently available for a knockdown price. Go get it!\nInternational Premier League TV rights\n• UK: Sky Sports and TNT Sports are the two main players, but Amazon also have a slice of the pie in 2023/24.\n• USA: NBC Sports Group are the Premier League rights holders, with the Peacock Premium streaming platform showing all 380 games in the season.
