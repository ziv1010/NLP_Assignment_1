This has to be clear for everyone.”\nIf Spurs are to salvage their season and secure Champions League qualification again, blocking out the external noise will be key.\nI struggled a lot after that (Sheffield United) match. I learned something but I want to keep this learning with me and not tell you because I don’t want to repeat that situation.\nCristian Stellini\nConte has contributed towards that with his explosive rant at Southampton where he let rip at his “selfish players” who have won “no trophies”.\nBut Stellini, who worked with the former Chelsea boss at Juventus and Inter Milan, appeared to suggest no wholesale changes will be required despite Tottenham’s wildly inconsistent 2023 producing eight wins and seven defeats.\nHe added: “I prefer to not change the dynamic. The only change is that I take decisions now.\n“We have to follow the process we had because we are in fourth position at the moment. We know very well that the other teams have games in hand, but we are where it is important that we are.\n“We can challenge everyone and we know very well that with our team we can beat everyone. We just need to play like we did in the past against important teams.”\nConte’s frustration with Tottenham’s lack of stability boiled over at St Mary’s and ultimately accelerated his exit.\nIt has been a tumultuous season for the Italian, who lost three close friends over the winter and even his trusted assistant admitted it took a lot out of him.\n“With all the situation he had around him, this was absolutely the best because I have never seen Antonio not work at his best,” Stellini insisted.\n“Probably that was his best and he forced himself many times to get over the situations around him and that maybe created for him an effort that was too big.\n“It could be a reason the decision was taken – although it is not up to me to say. All I can say is that Antonio pushed himself the best for everything at every moment.”\nThe responsibility of Spurs’ top four charge now falls to Stellini, who has taken charge of six matches this season and, despite notable results against Manchester City and Chelsea, it was defeat at Sheffield United in the FA Cup where he learnt the most.\nHe added: “It was a good learning, this match. I struggled a lot after that match. I learned something but I want to keep this learning with me and not tell you because I don’t want to repeat that situation.\n“Me and the players, we know the difference. We have to take care that that never happens again.”",
