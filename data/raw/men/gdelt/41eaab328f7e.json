Nothing changes in my eyes. I just love playing football and having fun.\n\"Since the Euros, I have spent loads of time with my family, which is special to me. I have switched off completely from the game and social media and focused on myself and what I need to do to keep going. I am excited now for the season to start and I cannot wait to get back on the pitch.\"\nKelly's back-to-back Euros glory came after winning the Champions League for Arsenal in what has been a dream summer for the player who re-signed for the Gunners last month following a loan period from Manchester City.\nBut she continued: \"It is definitely not hard to get going again. You want to get going straightaway. We have got competitions to win this season that we are so hungry for, and once you taste success you want more of it, and we will continue to do that.\n\"For me, I just want to win everything that is possible, and my eyes are set high for this season with Arsenal, and future tournaments for England, too.\"\nKelly was speaking alongside two of Arsenal's other summer signings, Olivia Smith and Taylor Hinds, who have both joined from Liverpool.\nArsenal made Smith, who netted seven times in her debut Women's Super League season, the first £1million player in the women's game after agreeing a world-record fee with the Reds.\n\"It is definitely an honour, to come with such a hefty price tag for such a young player like me,\" said the 20-year-old.\n\"Arsenal see the potential that I have, and they see my mindset. I am hungry, driven, I want to learn, I want to grow and I want to win things ultimately.\n\"The money is not really a big deal for me. It is more about being around these girls and to keep growing and learning in this environment.\"\nArsenal will open their bid to dethrone Chelsea as WSL champions against London City Lionesses on September 6.",
