  "body_text": "This weekend marks the beginning of an exciting new era for Australia's most celebrated annual knockout competition, as the Hahn Australia Cup 2025 gets underway.\nFootball Queensland Far North Regional Men sides Redlynch Strikers United FC and Mareeba United Men FC will share the honours of opening the Hahn Australia Cup 2025 when they face off on Saturday, 1 February at 7.00pm AEDT at Calanna Park, Cairns in the first official game of the tournament.\nOver 500 teams have registered so far for the Hahn Australia Cup 2025, with that number expected to eclipse last year's number of 759 entrants as registrations remain open in multiple Member Federations. Football VIC, Football West, and NNSW Football will commence their respective preliminary rounds throughout February, with Capital Football, Football NSW, Football NT, Football SA, and Football TAS kicking off in March.\n2025 also marks the beginning of a new chapter, with the Australia Cup officially becoming the 'Hahn Australia Cup', a partnership that unites one of Australia's iconic beer brands with the nation's premier grassroots-to-professional football competition.\nSince its modern establishment by Football Australia in 2014, the competition has gone from strength to strength each year, delivering exciting 'Cupsets' and countless magical moments.\nThe 2024 edition of the Hahn Australia Cup saw a record four Cupsets, the most of any previous year of the tournament, and marked the first time a Cupset was won by more than one goal, with Oakleigh Cannons FC (Football VIC) prevailing 3-1 over Sydney FC and Heidelberg United FC (Football VIC) defeating the Central Coast Mariners FC by the same score.\nTeams from community grassroots leagues up to the semi-professional National Premier Leagues (NPL) will compete in each preliminary round to advance to the Round of 32, where Isuzu UTE A-League teams join the competition. They will then strive to progress through the Round of 16, Quarter Finals, Semi Finals, and the Final to be crowned the Hahn Australia Cup 2025 Winners.\nFootball Australia CEO, James Johnson said: \"The start of the Hahn Australia Cup 2025 is a moment of pride and excitement as we embark on a new chapter for this iconic competition.\n\"Partnering with Hahn, one of Australia's most loved beer brands, is a testament to the growing stature of this tournament and together, we're ready to bring fans a bigger, better, and more engaging experience than ever before.\n\"As we kick off a new season, the Hahn Australia Cup continues to stand as the only national competition that unites grassroots and professional clubs in a shared pursuit of glory. It's a stage where the true spirit of Australian football comes alive.\n\"The Hahn Australia Cup also provides a unique pathway from community to international club competition, with the Hahn Australia Cup 2025 Winner to represent Australia in the 2026/27 AFC Champions League 2.\n\"We anticipate a tournament that not only promises to showcase the extraordinary skills and enthusiasm of the Australian footballing community but also herald in a new era for the competition which witnesses the excellence, growth, and widespread passion for the sport throughout Australia,\" concluded Johnson.\nFootball Australia would like to acknowledge the support of Australia Cup 2025 naming rights partner Hahn, as well as the continued support of commercial partners Mitre, Network 10, Qantas, and Subway.",
