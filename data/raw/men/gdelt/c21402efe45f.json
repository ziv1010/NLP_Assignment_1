They were effective in the last part of the pitch and we made some mistakes, it is hard to accept that. If you make mistakes you pay for that.\n“Their press worked. We tried to put in front of their goal as many chances as possible but we weren’t so effective in the last part of the pitch.\n“But the scoreline is excessive. The result is so big for them. But I think we didn’t deserve that result.”",
