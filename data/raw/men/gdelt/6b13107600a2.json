We’re a breeding ground for very good players.”\nRiver manager Marcelo Gallardo noted: “What we have to do is support him; he’s a kid who has his feet on the ground, but it’s not a bad idea to support him and make him feel like he has to keep growing.”\nLatest Real Madrid news: Sesko offer response, Rodrygo demands\nMadrid have been offered the chance to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.\nArsenal are in talks with Leipzig and Sesko, but a Spanish report has claimed that Los Blancos have now been handed the chance to bring the Slovenia international striker to the Santiago Bernabeu.\nMadrid have responded to the offer to sign Sesko.\nMadrid forward Rodrygo has told Arsenal his wage demands if he is to join the Premier League club in the summer transfer window.\nArsenal are keen on a summer deal for the Brazil international forward and are in talks over bringing him to the Emirates Stadium.\nMeanwhile, Alonso has reportedly told his Madrid bosses to sign a £63million striker.",
