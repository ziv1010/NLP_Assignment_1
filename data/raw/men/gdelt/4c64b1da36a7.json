That in itself is gigantic progress for Mauricio Pochettino's side.\nThe Blues have clearly improved in recent weeks, winning three on the bounce in the Premier League and booking a place in the Carabao Cup final.\nOne of Pochettino's former clubs, Tottenham Hotspur, are also catching the eye. With their star players slowly returning from injury, expect them to be in the power rankings once again very soon.\nAxed this week\nBologna, PSV Eindhoven, Bayern Munich, Arsenal\nOk, there's quite a few so let's take them one-by-one.\nBologna: Since they beat Inter their form has fallen off a cliff, and they're now without a win in their last four games.\nPSV Eindhoven: The team who won every single league game so far this season finally didn't win a league game this past week, drawing with Utrecht and then losing to Feyenoord in the KNVB Cup.\nBayern Munich: They signed Harry Kane and yet, somehow, still aren't top of the Bundesliga due to silly defeats to Eintracht Frankfurt and Werder Bremen either side of Christmas.\nArsenal: They couldn't buy a goal for about a month.\nThe 10 current best teams in Europe\n10. AC Milan (new entry)\nFollowing a rather so-so start to the season, AC Milan have finally found their groove in recent weeks.\nTheir six wins on the trot have seen them rise up to third in the Serie A table, and looking set to rather comfortably quality for the UEFA Champions League again next season.\n9. Real Madrid (down 5)\nDown five this week largely thanks to being knocked out of the Copa del Rey by arch rivals Atletico Madrid (who'll we talk about very soon).\nThe win over Almeria didn't do too much to stop their slide down the rankings either, they needed a lot of help to get over the line against a team who haven't won a single game of football this season.\n8. Atletico Madrid (re-entry)\nAs mentioned, Atleti famously knocked their Madrid rivals out of the Copa del Rey recently, and that win came thanks to their new all-time top goalscorer Antoine Griezmann.\nThe France forward is still one of the very best footballers around. Give the man his flowers, he's earned them.\n7. Aston Villa (down 6)\nAfter a stunning first half of the 2023/24 season, Aston Villa's form has noticeably dipped recently.\nThe Villans are still in top four contention, but the draw with Everton and defeat to Manchester United seriously dented their Premier League title aspirations.\n6. Juventus (re-entry)\nNow 18 games unbeaten, and having reeled off seven impressive wins on the spin, it's time to officially say it: Juventus are back to their best.\nA lot of that form has been down to the wonderful performances of their watertight back three, but let's also give kudus to the recent form of Dusan Vlahovic too.\nThe Serbian has been scoring goals for fun in 2024, netting five in five already.\n5. Manchester City (re-entry)\nIf Kevin De Bruyne's cameo appearance against Newcastle United is anything to go by, then Manchester City are going to be as scary as ever in 2024.\nThe midfielder ran the show upon his return from injury, and if he can stay fit his team will be favourites to win every single game and every single trophy available throughout the rest of the season.\n4. Inter (up 6)\nSpeaking of trophies, Inter won on this past week.\nTheir dramatic win over SSC Napoli, courtesy of a last minute strike from Lautaro Martinez (who else?), secured the Supercoppa Italiana for I Nerazzurri.\nIf their recent form in the league and on the continent is anything to go by, it won't be the last trophy they win this season either.\n3. Girona (-)\nIt's late January and Girona are still top of La Liga.\nAnd they are top of La Liga because they're actually just really bloody good.\nTheir 5-1 win over Sevilla on Sunday evening was even more proof of that.\n2. Liverpool (up 5)\nCup final? Check. Top of the Premier League? Check.\nThings are going quite well for Liverpool at the moment.\nJurgen Klopp's side are scoring goals for fun, and not conceding too many at the end either thanks to the brilliance of Virgil van Dijk. That is how you win games of football...if you didn't know already.\n1. Bayer Leverkusen (-)\nAccording to their Wikipedia page, Bayer Leverkusen have already won the 2023/24 Bundesliga title.\nAnd while they haven't actually won it yet (it's January), they're certainly on their way to.\nLeverkusen are now four points clear atop of the Bundesliga table thanks to their remarkable unbeaten first half of the season.",
