But sadly, that won't be the case anymore\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nBoth Bertakis and Bleakley have decided to hang up the boots and gloves respectively in the Illawarra Premier League, ending a 20-year playing association with their beloved club.\nThe pair have been part of the SCU furniture for half of the club's 40-year history, but now are stepping aside to let the next crop of young talent come through the ranks.\nBleakley knew that 2024 would be his final year for some time. But for Bertakis, it was an entirely different story. The crafty forward informed his coach and long-time friend Valic just a few days prior to SCU's final game of the season against Tarrawanna that it would be his last.\nWhilst Bertakis' playing time has been limited somewhat in recent times, there's no doubting that when fully fit, the striker has very much still got it. And in his final game at Tarrawanna Oval, SCU's no.11 marked the occasion with a goal from the spot to cap off a stellar career, which you can watch below...\nHe said finishing his career in front of family and friends was the perfect way to cap it all off.\n\"My final was game a special day for both Jason and I in front of family and friends,\" Bertakis said.\n\"There was plenty of emotion around the ground and in the dressing sheds. To have my son run us out onto the ground and to score the goal was the icing on the cake of a joyous playing career with South Coast United. To have played 20 years of first grade in the club's 40th year is quite special.\n\"To remain relatively injury free and to play for so long is rare. To have done it with Jason and many others was a real honour, something not too many people get to experience.\"\nSCU is one of those all to rare clubs these days where there is a real passion for the jersey and everything it stands for. Those at the club like Bertakis and Bleakley emulate this. As a result, the club, and those two players in particular, are widely respected within the Illawarra football community.\n\"It's a changing of the guard,\" Bertakis continued.\n\"At one time, it was not uncommon for us to have six or seven players in the squad that were there for 10 to 15 years. We always had a good culture and good morale, and everyone stuck around for the right reasons. Not for the money, just for the club.\n\"You don't stay for the accolades, you stay for the joy of it. It's a great little club with the best facilities in the Illawarra and I would encourage any aspiring footballers to come to play for our club.\"\nBleakley's best\nVeteran shot-stopper Bleakley highlighted any time the team would beat rivals Albion Park as a standout for him in his 20-year association with SCU.\nThere was in fact one year when the goalkeeper moved away from SCU to Corrimal, but he quickly realised he needed to come back.\n\"That's probably my only regret out of the whole thing,\" Bleakley said.\n\"But after the last game against Tarrawanna [last week] we went back to the pub with the Tarra boys, just Ricky, me, and Greg. And they made a special mention to us about how you don't really see this kind of commitment anymore. Those days are gone. But we've got a couple of young blokes coming through that are proudly Croatian. So hopefully they can stick around and kind of take over from where me and Rick left off.\n\"They'll be fine without me and Ricky. Ricky and I have just always loved the culture and the people and the committee. From day dot I just loved it, and that's why I think I stayed so long.\"\nAs mentioned, Bleakley had many of fond memories of beating rivals APWE, as well as playing alongside the likes of former A-League player Brendan Santalab and former Asian Champions League winner Cho Byung-kuk in more recent times.\n\"To this day with the team we had, I don't know how we didn't win the league,\" he continued.\n\"I fell in love with the club straight away. The committee just welcomed you. I started playing youth grade at 15 with Cringila, but there was just a different feeling at South Coast. It was all about promoting youth, and they're still about that. That's why I think I fell in love with the club and stayed for so long.\n\"Obviously I've met heaps of mates like Ricky and Greg and others. That'll stick with me for a long time.\n\"Probably the memory that sticks out the most was beating Albion Park in a semi-final years ago now. We had a good crowd, it was hammering down rain. I just remember that game like it was yesterday. We went one-nil up early and then held on before scoring late. Just beating Albion Park obviously with that rivalry made it special.\n\"The whole crowd came into the shads after the game to sing the team song and you couldn't even hear yourself. You could see how much it meant to everyone at the club.\"\nWhilst both Bleakley and Bertakis weren't exactly sure what the future holds for them in the football space, both of them said they would be proud SCU supporters for life.",
