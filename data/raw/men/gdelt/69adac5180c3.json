  "body_text": "Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem has warned that there will be “no life” for Lebanon if authorities confront the Iran-backed movement, as tension over Beirut's plan to disarm the group escalates.\nThe Hezbollah secretary general accused the government of effectively handing Lebanon over to Israel by pushing for disarmament.\nThe Lebanese government last week adopted the objectives of a US proposal that includes the disarmament of Hezbollah, despite all Shiite ministers storming out of the cabinet meeting where the plan was being discussed.\nThe cabinet decision drew praise from the US, but sparked street protests in areas where Hezbollah has support.\n“Are you satisfied that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu congratulated you?” Mr Qassem said, accusing the government of following US and Israeli demands. “The government is implementing an American-Israeli order to end the resistance, even if it leads to civil war and internal strife,” Mr Qassem said.\nIn response, Prime Minister Nawaf Salam posted an excerpt of an interview he gave to the Asharq Al Awsat newspaper on X, in which he said Mr Qassem's comments \"carry an implicit threat of civil war\".\n\"No one in Lebanon today wants a civil war, and threatening or hinting at it is completely unacceptable,\" he said. \"The talk that the Lebanese government is implementing an American-Israeli project is baseless,\" he said, insisting that decisions taken were \"purely Lebanese\".\n\"No party in Lebanon is authorised to bear arms outside the scope of the Lebanese state,\" he said. \"No one has demanded that Hezbollah's weapons be handed over to the Israeli enemy, as some promote, but rather to the Lebanese army.\"\nWhile Hezbollah has repeatedly rejected the government's plan to disarm it, Mr Qassem's speech is the strongest statement yet by the group. He called on authorities to build the country together, respecting all sects and religions. He spoke at an event to mark Arbaeen, which comes 40 days after the commemoration of Ashura.\n“This is our land together, this is our homeland together, we live with pride together, and we build its sovereignty together,” he said. “Or there is no life for Lebanon if you try to confront us and eliminate us.”\nHe criticised the government, holding it responsible for failing to stop Israel's daily bombings of Lebanon and for not pursuing Israel over the five points of Lebanese territory it occupies.\n“The resistance will not surrender its weapons while aggression continues, occupation persists, and we will fight it … if necessary to confront this American-Israeli project no matter the cost,” he said.\nHezbollah has repeatedly said it will not discuss a national defence strategy until Israel withdraws from Lebanon and ceases its bombing.\n“There is still room for discussion, for adjustments, and for a political resolution before the situation escalates to a confrontation no one wants,” Mr Qassem said.\n“But if it is imposed on us, we are ready.”\nMr Qassem said Hezbollah and the Amal movement, its Shiite ally, had decided to delay street protests against a US-backed disarmament plan because they still believe there is room for dialogue with the Lebanese government. But he threatened that protests could reach the US embassy in Lebanon.\nThe Hezbollah leader's speech was also criticised by some of the group's opponents.\n“Naim Qassem's party brought occupation, humanitarian catastrophe and economic collapse to Lebanon,” said Ashraf Rifi, an MP and former interior minister. “Today, after its defeat, it threatens the Lebanese state and people, presents itself as a victim and accuses the majority of treason.”\nMr Qassem's speech follows a meeting this week with Ali Larijani, Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council. He was visiting Beirut and held a number of tense meetings with Lebanese officials.\nIn a powerful rebuke of the group's main backer, Lebanon's President and Prime Minister told Mr Larijani of their deep dissatisfaction over Iran's criticism of plans to disarm Hezbollah.\nLast week the government gave the army until the end of the month to prepare a plan to bring all weapons under state control by the end of 2025.",
