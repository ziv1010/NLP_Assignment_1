Stevenson, who was with the side he supported as a youngster from July 2007 and February 2010, was at last night’s first leg at Airdrie which ended 0-0.\nThe 27-year-old has fond memories of scoring a goal in a play-off against the same opposition which took the Honest Men into the First Division in May 2009: “Nothing beats scoring the winner for your home town team to clinch promotion,\" he told the Ayrshire Post. \"I have always had a special relationship with Ayr and have supported them since I was a boy.\n“That goal will always mean so much to me. I missed the first leg through suspension then came back to score the winner.\n“The whole occasion and the celebrations afterwards were amazing. The significance of the goal means I will never forget it. I’m now back home and will be at both games against Airdrie to roar on the lads. I still get twinges when I see Ayr and wish I could play.\n“Ayr are my team. Goalie Kevin Cuthbert was the best man at my wedding, so I have a great affinity with the club.”\nStevenson, who joined the Blues from Hearts for £50,000 in January, is back home in Troon with his wife Hannah and son Carter, who was born nine weeks ago.\nThe midfielder, who walloped in his first Blues goal in the 3-2 victory at Doncaster on the final day of the season, expects Town to make a better showing in his first full season at Portman Road: “After I signed in January, we went on a great run and in the end were unlucky not to make the play-offs. We’ll have a real go next season.”\nPhoto: Action Images\nPhoto: Action Images via Reuters\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nPerhaps some of \"our\" comments on these web-pages have even put players off from even considering coming to PR.\nI've lived in Scotland and, believe me, the passion of the fans of Ayr, of Airdrie, of Aberdeen et al, is just as fervent as at any other club. Are we also forgetting a certain George Burley who was a passionate footballer from Ayrshire?\nAlso, please remember that all these press comments are on the spur of the moment, and even misquoted. Most of the words attributed to Ryan here are from 2009. His quotes about us being \" unlucky not to make the play-offs,\" and, \"We'll have a real go next season,” should be interpreted as positive ones. Forget details, it's the commitment that counts. Ryan, it seems, is determined to be an ITFC hero, and we should be behind him, not nitpicking.\nGood luck to him!\nSnip at 50k and with a good pre-season behind him, he will only improve.\nSome of these posters on here are cyber budgies and many others dont even know where Portman Rd is, let alone travel away.\nCome on...\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
