  "body_text": "After over a decade of consistency under Diego Simeone, Atlético Madrid arrive at the Club World Cup ready to chase a long-awaited international title. Backed by experience, structure, and a hunger to finally go all the way, they look to make their mark on the global stage.\n1) Who will Atlético Madrid face at the Club World Cup?\nAtlético Madrid have been drawn into Group B and these are their group stage fixtures:\n15 June: vs Paris Saint-Germain. Rose Bowl, Los Angeles.\n19 June: vs Seattle Sounders. Lumen Field, Seattle.\n23 June: vs Botafogo. Rose Bowl, Los Angeles.\n2) History of ups and downs\nAtlético Madrid have always been a big club in Spanish football; only Real Madrid and Barcelona have won more La Liga titles, with los Colchoneros' most-recent pre-Simeone title coming in 1996, although they were relegated four years later, spending two seasons stuck in the Segunda División.\n3) Transformation under Diego Simeone\nSince being appointed manager just before Christmas in 2011, Diego Simeone has completely transformed Atlético Madrid into the global powerhouse we know today. Los Colchoneros won the Europa League just six months later and then the Copa del Rey a year after that, historically defeating fierce rivals Real Madrid after extra time in the final at the Bernabéu no less.\nAtleti's consistency is most evident in their league positions, finishing no lower than fourth in La Liga in 13 successive seasons, having only achieved a trio of top four finishes across the previous 20 campaigns. They've been Spanish champions twice under el Cholo, capturing the title in both 2014 and 2021, the only non-Barça or Real winners since Rafa Benítez's Valencia 21 years ago.\n4) Chasing the Champions League dream\nAs well as their two La Liga crowns, los Rojiblancos have reached two Champions League Finals under Simeone, but were heartbreakingly beaten by rivals Real Madrid both teams, conceding a 94th minute equaliser in 2014, before a gut-wrenching penalty shootout loss two years later.\nHaving also been beaten by Bayern Munich in a replay in 1974, Atleti are the only club to have featured in three European Cup Finals without ever getting their hands on the trophy, although they have hoisted aloft two Europa Leagues and three UEFA Super Cups in the past 15 years.\n5) Another trophyless campaign\nThis season was ultimately a disappointing campaign for Atlético, finishing third in La Liga, 12 points adrift champions Barcelona. Following a last-gasp victory at Montjuïc just before Christmas, Atleti were top of the table at new year, but surprise away defeats at the hands of Leganés, Getafe, Las Palmas and Osasuna in the second half of the campaign completely derailed their title bid.\nOverall, since they were last La Liga champions four seasons ago, Atleti have not captured any silverware, not so much as reaching the final of any competition. This year, they were ousted by Barça in the Copa semi-finals, before being dumped out by, you guessed it, Real Madrid in the Champions League round of 16 on penalties.\n6) Past Club World Cup expirence\nAtlético Madrid will debut at the FIFA Club World Cup this summer. They did though win the competition's precursor the Intercontinental Cup in 1974. After Bayern Munich declined to participate, Atleti took on Copa Libertadores winners Independiente, beaten 1-0 in Buenos Aires, before capturing the trophy following a 2-0 victory back at the Vicente Calderón.\n7) Atlético Madrid players to watch: Antoine Griezmann\nFew players are more closely associated with Atleti's rise across the last decade or so than Antoine Griezmann. Across two spells, the French international has made 442 appearances for los Rojiblancos, only six men have more, while his tally of 197 goals is a club-record, surpassing Luis Aragonés' tally of 158, a record that had stood since 1974.\nNow 34, their are signs that Griezmann's powers are waning, having not scored a goal since 25 February, failing to find the net in any of his last 16 La Liga appearances. Nevertheless, he remains a key figure for Simeone, so will continue to be one of the first names on the Atleti team sheet.\n8) Atlético Madrid players to watch: Jan Oblak\nAt the other end of the field, since joining from Benfica in 2014, goalkeeper Jan Oblak has racked up 492 appearances for Atleti.\nThis leaves him behind only Adelardo, who played for the club between 1959 and 1974, as well as current teammate Koke on the all-time list, unlikely to catch the latter's tally of 681, and counting.\nThe Slovenian picked up yet another Ricardo Zamora Trophy this season, the award given to the La Liga goalkeeper with the best goals-to-game ratio, becoming the first-ever six-time winner of the accolade. He is widely-considered to be one of the best in the world and will be key to their chances this summer.\n9) Alexander Sørloth's super sub scoring spree\nThis was Alexander Sørloth's debut season at Atlético Madrid and he ended the campaign as the club's top-scorer in La Liga. This is remarkable considering 20 of his 25 league appearances came as a substitute, still unable to force his way into Simeone's regular first choice XI.\nOf his 24 goals across all competitions, 13 were scored as a substitute, including a 25 minute hat-trick against Girona at Montilivi on the final day of the season. A few weeks earlier, Sørloth scored four in the first half against former club Real Sociedad, the first three of which came just three minutes and 57 seconds apart, the fastest treble in Primera División history. Fair to say, he's in good form.\n10) Atlético Madrid: amongst the favourites?\nAtlético Madrid have to be amongst the favourites to make a deep run at this summer's Club World Cup. They commence their campaign by taking on another European heavyweight Paris Saint-Germain at the Rose Bowl, before meetings with Seattle Sounders and Botafogo.\nMost expect Atleti to finish in the top two of Group B, before being favourites whoever they face in the last 16, although they could then run into Bayern Munich or Chelsea in the quarter-finals.",
