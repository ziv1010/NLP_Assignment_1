  "body_text": "Galatasaray vice-president arrived in England yesterday to hold talks with Manchester United over two players, according to an explosive report from Türkiye.\nPushing for Ugarte\nThe Turkish giants, who are currently three points clear at the summit of the Süper Lig with only one loss this season, have been strongly linked with a move for Manuel Ugarte this month.\nThe 24-year-old midfielder has struggled with the physicality of Premier League football since arriving from Paris Saint-Germain in 2024. Despite costing a total of £50.5 million (£42.1m + £8.4m in add-ons), the Uruguay international has done little to justify this exorbitant price, even after being reunited with Ruben Amorim.\nThe pair both established themselves in European football with Sporting CP, with Ugarte’s performances for the Lions earning him a move to PSG in 2023.\nHowever, Amorim told Ugarte he did “not recognise” the player he knew in Lisbon, accusing him of having become too “comfortable” in a team meeting at Carrington last year. His performances this season have done little to absolve him of this allegation, even after Amorim’s departure earlier this month.\nGalatasaray had planned to sign a new No. 6 in January, with Ugarte quickly emerging as a key target.\nUnited were understood to be open to their midfielder’s departure, provided a replacement could be sourced. But this would have required a permanent exit, or a loan with an obligation to buy at the end of the season, rather than the straight loan deal Galatasaray were pursuing.\nA report relayed by The Peoples Person revealed the Süper Lig champions had “agreed personal terms” with Ugarte, suggesting hope a deal could be struck despite the Red Devils’ reluctance.\nGalatasaray faced Manchester City in the Champions League last night, falling to a 2-0 defeat at the Etihad. But this gave the perfect opportunity for the club’s vice-president, Abdullah Kavukcu, to hold talks in the red half of the city.\nTurkish journalist Ertem Şener (as relayed by Sports Witness) reveals Kavukcu will “sit at the table” with United’s hierarchy for a “very serious transfer negotiation” today – with Ugarte expected to be the main topic of conversation.\nMainoo also on the menu\nHowever, in a shock twist, the report also states Kavukcu will enquire about the availability of Kobbie Mainoo.\nThe 20-year-old midfielder was desperate to leave this month before INEOS axed Amorim, as the Portuguese coach had relegated him down the rankings at Old Trafford due to his discomfort in the 3-4-2-1 formation.\nThe arrival of Michael Carrick – along with a 4-2-3-1 system – has reignited Mainoo’s United career, with the England international one of the best players in the back-to-back victories over City and Arsenal.\nThere is zero chance the Red Devils would countenance an exit for Mainoo after these developments, meaning Kavukcu should stick to the starlet’s Uruguayan midfield partner during negotiations.\nFeatured image Michael Regan via Getty Images\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade.
