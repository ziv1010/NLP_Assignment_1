  "body_text": "Liverpool reportedly have a free run at signing a highly-rated South American centre-back in 2026.\nJohn Aldridge has called for the Reds to strengthen defensively during the January transfer window, describing a prospective swoop for Marc Guehi as a ‘must’ for the Merseysiders, but whether Richard Hughes can persuade Crystal Palace to sell their captain mid-season is another question.\nReports from overseas have now suggested that the Premier League champions are in pole position to land a Champions League participant with whom they were first linked just over a year ago.\nLiverpool reportedly leading the race to sign Joel Ordonez\nAccording to Bolavip, Liverpool are the frontrunners to sign Joel Ordonez from Club Brugge, with Chelsea withdrawing from negotiations over a potential €40m [34.8m] move for the Ecuador international despite Stamford Bridge seemingly being his preferred destination.\nThat has seemingly ‘cleared the way’ for the Reds to make their move for the 21-year-old, although Inter Milan continue to monitor the situation with a view to potentially gazumping the Merseysiders.\nWhat qualities could Ordonez bring to Liverpool?\nOrdonez has accrued a wealth of high-level experience in European football, having recently surpassed a century of appearances for Club Brugge, with nearly 20% of those coming in the Champions League (Transfermarkt).\nAs evidenced below by underlying performance metrics comparing him with other centre-backs across Europe in 2025 (via FBref), the Ecuadorian stands out for his ball-playing abilities, traits which were evident from his teenage years at Independiente del Valle in his homeland.\nThe big unknown about the 21-year-old is how he would adapt to playing in the Premier League, which’d be a significant step up from the Belgian top flight, although his experience of Champions League football should stand him in quite good stead.\nGuehi would still be the most desirable centre-back acquisition for Liverpool in January, given his homegrown status, proven ability in England and his obvious fit for what the Reds are seeking in a player, given the club’s pursuit of him during the summer.\nHowever, if the Palace captain proves to be unattainable next month, Richard Hughes may well give serious consideration to exploring a move for Ordonez, especially now that Chelsea have seemingly pulled out of the race for the youngster.\nLet’s see if this one develops any further throughout the January transfer window.",
