  "body_text": "In the latest instalment of a series talking to Manchester United fans around the world, Andy Mitten travelled to Dublin in August for a sold-out pre-season friendly against Spain’s Athletic Bilbao at the 51,000-capacity Aviva Stadium.\nOther groups of United supporters around the world The Athletic has already visited: San Diego, New York and New Jersey, Jeddah, Islamabad, Oslo and Adelaide.\nAdvertisement\nWhy United?\nLouise Berney: “I’m 40, a Dubliner from the northside and was born a Red. I’m named after Lou Macari. My dad is a big Man United fan, yet his two brothers are Leeds fans. My nana’s best friend was engaged to (United legend) Johnny Carey. We have a young Alex and a Ryan in our family now.\n“I go to Old Trafford for most games. I have a season ticket and we’re part of the Dublin supporters’ club, where I’m the membership secretary. We organise trips to every home game and usually go by ferry, as we like to travel in a group. We have just under 400 members from Dublin — that is official United members who can apply for tickets. It used to be called the Ireland branch and started in 1969, but we’re now proud that there are branches all over Ireland.\n“For a 3pm kick-off on Saturday, we’d normally get the 2am ferry and dock at Holyhead in Wales at half-five. We then drive to a Wetherspoon’s pub in Sale (a Manchester suburb) for breakfast, then to the Railway Club in Stretford for a drink. We then get back to Holyhead for the half-eight ferry at night. It’s a 24-hour trip for a 90-minute game and most people stay awake for the duration.\n“If it’s a half-five kick-off (on a Saturday), we get the ferry at 8am on matchday and you don’t get back to Dublin until six the following morning. I might go to bed for an hour or two but then I go to work in the head office of a retail company.\n🇮🇪 Our connection with Ireland will always be special.\nUntil next time, Dublin 🙏#MUFC pic.twitter.com/noyEc0axFf\n— Manchester United (@ManUtd) August 6, 2023\n“I’ve been to three Champions League finals, plus a Europa League final and numerous domestic cup finals. Moscow in 2008 for the Champions League final was the best, my high point as a fan. I’d broken my foot and was in a cast and on two crutches when I travelled to Russia. I danced on my one good foot after the penalties there. It cost me €2,500 (£2,160 $2,730), and that didn’t include a hotel, but it was worth every penny. I feel blessed and privileged to have experienced what I have at my age.”\nAdvertisement\nBrian Murphy: “I support United because of my nan. She had Sky Sports before we did. I went to her house and couldn’t understand why she was so passionate shouting at the TV when I went to see her. I was about five. ‘That’s Man United, that’s my team’, she said. ‘They always have Irish lads playing for them’.\n“My dad was also a fan and I watched games with family. I’d go to the odd match and then when I became an adult I started to go to games all the time. Now, I’m a season-ticket holder and I go to 20 to 25 games per season home and away and in Europe, where I’m on the full seven credits from past games attended. I also run the supporters’ club in West Limerick. We have between 200 and 300 paid-up members — a mix of people who go a lot and people who go once or twice per season.\n“A typical trip involves getting up at silly o’clock and going to the airport with a lack of sleep. Cork is 90 minutes away, Dublin almost three hours. I’d fly into anywhere we can get into: Manchester, Liverpool, London. The flights are usually at six or seven o’clock in the morning, so I’d leave home five hours before that.\n“I’m shattered, so I go straight to the pub when I arrive in Manchester — whichever pub is open earliest. There’s a good few of us go over and we have mates in Manchester. Liverpool and Leeds are also popular in Limerick. Rugby is also big (Munster, one of Europe’s most successful rugby union teams, play home games in Limerick) and hurling is massive.\n“We meet new people all the time following United. I’d arranged to meet one Irish Red at Villa Park, who I’d only spoken to via Twitter. I went to the pub where we’d arranged to meet and there was a man who collapsed. There wasn’t much I could do, I’m a plumber, so I made space while the paramedics came.\n“Drinks were flowing, I was getting nicely merry and it was heading towards kick-off when my phone rang. It was my long-lost mate from Twitter. He was late. I answered the phone and it’s an English lady with a thick Brummie accent. ‘Is that Brian? Your friend is outside the bar in an ambulance, there’s been a bit of an incident and we need a friend of his to come to him’.\nAdvertisement\n“I was s******* myself because a) I didn’t actually know the lad; b) I was half-pissed; c) I’m not exactly great in situations of severity, especially when someone’s in medical trouble. The ambulance lady opened the door and calmly walked out to me. ‘Now look, he’s not in great shape, so don’t be alarmed when you go into him’, she said. I explained the situation, that I’ve never met the fella and only knew him off Twitter.\n“He’d had an epileptic seizure, his first in a decade, and dropped like a sack of spuds. I was the only person he knew in Birmingham. I stuck my head in the door and saw a man who looked a mix of grey and green. ‘Hiya, mate. I’m Brian. Nice to meet you’, I said.\n“We walked down to one of the burger vans near the ground and I thought, ‘A bit of fresh air and he’ll be right as rain’. But he wasn’t and said he wanted to sleep it off at the hotel. I didn’t see him again until Atletico Madrid away (in 2022), where he was in much better spirits and had no seizures to report since.”\nDale, 27: “I started supporting United because I enjoyed winding up my grandad — a Liverpool fan — in Clonmel, Tipperary. Liverpool and United are huge in Clonmel, while hurling is the most popular sport.\n“English football is so popular and you’d see that in the pubs and bars, though less so now with the price of drinks and cost of living. More watch it at home, but there’s the geography, England’s close and a lot of Irish players have played there, including for United. Some of United’s greatest ever players were Irish: George Best, Roy Keane, Johnny Carey and a Busby Babe in Liam Whelan. There aren’t many now, but I don’t think it will affect the support much here.\n“I’ve always felt welcomed when I’ve gone to Manchester. I spoke to older lads who said that wasn’t always the case in the 1980s, but I get looked after. It’s like family and I see Manchester as a second home. I love it. I went on my first European trip this year to Seville, a fantastic city and trip, but the less said about the game the better.”\nDerek Berney: “I’ve been involved in the Dublin branch for 33 years and was the chairman of the supporters’ club for many years. I’ve been a regular at Old Trafford since 1975 and first joined the club after the 1979 FA Cup final against Arsenal. I’d been to that game and got tickets — in the Arsenal end, which wasn’t ideal. I didn’t want to make that mistake again.\nAdvertisement\n“One of the biggest challenges we had for a long time with the supporters’ club was hotels. Manchester didn’t have many and we’d stay near Stockport at times. That has all changed.\n“We’ve travelled by boat for a long time. We run a trip, usually a coach, to every single home game — that was three or four coaches 20 years ago, when you could get tickets. Demand for tickets is now much higher. We could bring multiple coaches if we had tickets again. The club have been good to us over the years, though, they try to help us.”\nHow would you describe the football support in Dublin?\nLouise: “Phenomenal. United, Liverpool and Celtic are the most popular. I know of only two Manchester City fans. There are lots of fans who also support local clubs, too. My cousin goes to Old Trafford but is a big Bohs (Dublin-based League of Ireland club Bohemians) fan. I’ve never had much interest in the local teams.”\nDale: “There’s a massive Irish United following and I’m very proud of it. We’re speaking in Dublin, where the game sold out in no time. United haven’t been here for six years and I think they should play here more often.”\nDerek: “I feel for the kids here today in Dublin, where the game sold out in no time. I get to see the first team at Old Trafford all the time, but the kids here won’t see the star players (United sent a second-string having faced Lens of France in Manchester the previous day). That said, I support whoever wears the crest.”\n(Top photo: The Athletic’s Andy Mitten with Dale; Andy Mitten/The Athletic)",
