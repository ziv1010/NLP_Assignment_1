For me, it's a signal. The league is playing too safe and has forgotten how to take risks,\" Kahn wrote on his personal LinkedIn account.\n\"(The question is) whether we want to remain a league that creates talent and loses it -- or whether we want to create the conditions for talents to stay here.\"\nKahn did not directly call for the abolition of the 50+1 rule, but said that structural restraints meant \"bold decisions don't emerge\".\nUnder the 50+1 rule, German clubs must be majority owned by club members -- mostly fans -- thus restricting external investment.\nThe only two clubs which have an exception to that rule, Bayer-owned Leverkusen and Volkswagen-owned Wolfsburg, have won league titles in the past 20 years.\nDouble winners in 2023-24, Leverkusen lost eight members of that team this summer, with five moving to the Premier League.\nLeverkusen's sporting director Simon Rolfes told DAZN this season: \"when a domino falls in England, it will fall here. As a club you have almost no choice but to let the player go.\"\nAs Europe's largest nation and a traditional football powerhouse, some view the rivers of Premier League gold as an opportunity.\nThis summer, Borussia Dortmund, Leverkusen, RB Leipzig and Stuttgart each sold at least one player to the Premier League for a fee of more than 50 million euros.\nRolfes said the \"key factor in offsetting the Premier League's economic advantage\" was the \"professionalisation of youth academy programmes\".\nThe wealth available has the potential to change a German club's fortunes.\nIn 2024, Porsche paid 100 million euros to take a minority stake in Stuttgart, providing the side with financial security. Stuttgart qualified for the Champions League in 2024, the first time in 15 years, and won the German Cup a season later.\nIn August, Stuttgart received 85 million euros for Woltemade, who arrived on a free a season earlier.\nOne of Europe's biggest clubs, even Bayern have not escaped the ripple effects. Despite courting Wirtz and Woltemade, both players moved to the Premier League.\nEarlier this season, Bayern sporting director Max Eberl said \"certain things weren't possible during the transfer window because we want to be very financially prudent.\"\nAsked at a press conference on Friday to assess the appeal of the Premier League this transfer window, Bayern coach Vincent Kompany gave a one-word answer: \"money\".\nIn Germany, Bayern's woes are unlikely to win them too much sympathy. The growing financial might of the Premier League presents a real challenge to Bayern's status as the league's apex predators.\nWinners of 34 German titles -- no other side has hit double figures -- Bayern have built their success on the back of plucking their rivals' best, particularly in recent seasons.\nThis summer shows competition from the Premier League is making that more difficult.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
