  "body_text": "Real Madrid and Lyon have agreed a deal for Brazilian striker Endrick to spend the second half of the season on loan with the Ligue 1 club, both sides announced on Tuesday.\nEndrick (front) of Real Madrid attempts a overhead kick during the Copa del Rey semifinal 2nd leg football match between Real Madrid and Real Sociedad, in Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, Madrid, Spain, on April 1, 2025. (Photo by Gustavo Valiente/Xinhua)\nLyon will pay Real Madrid around one million euros (1.18 million U.S. dollars) for the loan, which does not include an option to make the move permanent at the end of the campaign.\nThe 19-year-old joined Real Madrid in the summer of 2024. He scored one goal in 22 La Liga appearances last season, most of them as a substitute, but netted five times to help the club reach the Copa del Rey final.\nThis season, Endrick has lost playing time due to injury, making just three appearances -- one each in La Liga, the Cup and the UEFA Champions League. The loan move is expected to give him more minutes as he looks to secure a place in Brazil's squad for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.",
