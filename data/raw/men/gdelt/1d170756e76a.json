Sir @davidbeckham!!!\n“What an honour, I couldn’t be prouder of you. Your dedication to the things that matter most — your country, your work, your passion, and most of all, your family — has never wavered.\n“The way you’ve touched so many lives over the years with kindness and humility speaks volumes about the man you are and continues to inspire us everyday.\n“But above all else, I’m so, so proud to call you mine. I love you so much xxxx.”\nThe football star, who was formerly appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2003, responded to the post by expressing his love for his family, mentioning each of his children and adding “I love you all”.\nSir David first made his Premier League debut for United in 1995 and was part of the team that earned a dramatic Champions League final victory in 1999 when they beat Bayern Munich with two late goals.\nIn total he scored 85 goals and collected honours including six Premier League titles and two FA Cups as a footballer, before retiring from the sport in 2013.\nAlongside his footballing career, the sports star is also a supporter of a number of charity causes including being a founding member of the charity Malaria No More UK’s leadership council.\nSir David was also named as an ambassador last year for the King’s Foundation, an educational charity established by the King in 1990 and has been a Goodwill Ambassador for the humanitarian aid organisation Unicef since 2005.\nIn a statement to the PA News Agency, Sir David said: “Growing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honour.\n“To have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career and literally a boyhood dream come true.\n“Off the pitch I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to represent Britain around the world and work with incredible organisations that are supporting communities in need and inspiring the next generation.\n“I’m so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I’m grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment.\n“It will take a little while for the news to sink in but I’m immensely proud and it’s such an emotional moment for me to share with my family.”\nThe businessman is also the co-founder of Studio99, the production company behind the hit Netflix series, Beckham, and is a part-owner of MLS side Inter Miami.\nHe is also known for his fashion and was named most stylish man of the year by GQ magazine in 1998, has modelled for the likes of H&M, Armani and Boss, and was appointed ambassadorial president of the British Fashion Council (BFC) in 2018 where he assisted in its search for young British talent from all backgrounds.\nSir David is not the only fashion star in the family, with his wife Lady Beckham launching an eponymous fashion label in 2008 followed by a beauty brand in 2019.",
