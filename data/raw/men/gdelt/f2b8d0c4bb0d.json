The top two teams from each group will advance to the quarterfinals and secure their places at the global showpiece.\nHosts Saudi Arabia headline the tournament as top seeds, joined by Asia’s leading youth football nations and several emerging teams that impressed during the qualification phase. The draw balanced traditional powerhouses with ambitious newcomers, promising closely contested matches throughout the group stage.\nScheduled to take place from May 5 to May 22, 2026, the 21st edition of the AFC U17 Men’s Asian Cup will once again serve as a key platform for the continent’s brightest young talents to showcase their potential on the international stage.\nWith the groups now confirmed, preparations intensify as teams turn their focus toward tactical planning and squad development ahead of what is expected to be a thrilling tournament in Saudi Arabia.\n- Group A: Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Thailand, Myanmar\n- Group B: Japan, Indonesia, China, Qatar\n- Group C: South Korea, Yemen, Vietnam, UAE\n- Group D: Uzbekistan, Australia, India, North Korea\nSport\nAfghanistan’s semi-final hopes hang in the balance after two T20 World Cup defeats\nFollowing two consecutive losses, Afghanistan currently sit third in Group D with a net run rate of -0.555.\nAfghanistan’s campaign in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup has taken a serious hit after suffering back-to-back defeats, leaving fans concerned about the team’s chances of progressing to the semi-finals.\nFollowing two consecutive losses, Afghanistan currently sit third in Group D with a net run rate of -0.555.\nNew Zealand and South Africa lead the group standings with four points each from two matches.\nWith four matches scheduled per team in the group stage, only the top two sides will advance to the next round.\nDespite the setbacks, Afghanistan have not yet been eliminated from the tournament. However, their path to qualification has become significantly more complicated.\nTo secure a place in the Super 8 stage, Afghanistan must win their remaining two matches against the United Arab Emirates and Canada — and do so by substantial margins to improve their net run rate. At the same time, they will need either New Zealand or South Africa to suffer heavy defeats in their remaining group fixtures.\nIf these conditions are met, Afghanistan could still break into the top two based on a superior net run rate. While the scenario is challenging, qualification remains mathematically possible — keeping Afghan hopes alive in the tournament.\n-\nSport5 days ago\nChampions League Elite action continues as qualification race tightens\n-\nInternational Sports4 days ago\nIPL 2026: Franchise sales gather pace as global investors circle teams\n-\nSport5 days ago\nEarly medal leaders emerge as Winter Olympics continue in Italy\n-\nLatest News4 days ago\nTerrorist activities observed along Afghanistan borders, says Lavrov\n-\nWorld5 days ago\nHong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai sentenced to 20 years in jail in national security trial\n-\nLatest News5 days ago\nPakistan president claims situation in Afghanistan is ‘similar to or worse than pre-9/11’’\n-\nBusiness4 days ago\nUzbekistan approves feasibility study agreement for Trans-Afghan Railway\n-\nSport2 days ago\nAfghanistan’s semi-final hopes hang in the balance after two T20 World Cup defeats",
