  "body_text": "Real Madrid presented Álvaro Arbeloa as the new coach of the first team, and was asked how he would define the team he will build, following Xabi Alonso’s plan to build a “rock and roll” side, and Arbeloa said, “this club is about winning, winning and winning again. It’s about being demanding to win trophies and fill the trophy cabinet. That’s our guide. When I was a player, people taught me those values and they are still present today, that’s what’s most important. We have to excite our fans and fill the trophy cabinet. That’s my obsession I will live with every day.”\nÁlvaro Arbeloa: “Real Madrid is about winning, winning and winning again”\nThe new coach spoke for the first time\nÁlvaro Arbeloa on his new role\n“It’s a special day. As have been all the days I’ve been part of Madrid. I’m almost 43 and I’ve been here for 20 years, half of my life. It’s the best club in history. I’m aware of the responsibility I have and I’m very excited.”\nÁlvaro Arbeloa on if he’s spoken to Xabi Alonso\n““Yesterday afternoon, I was informed that Xabi and the club had reached an agreement and that they wanted me to take on the responsibility. Of course, I have spoken to Xabi. Everyone here knows how close we are. I appreciate him very much and I love him. I know it’s mutual. And it will continue to be that way.”\nÁlvaro Arbeloa on if he’s a caretaker or permanent coach\n““I’ve been here for 20 years and I’ll stay as long as Real Madrid wants me to. This is my home, that’s how I feel.”\n“What I discuss with Xabi stays between us. I’m really looking forward to my first game, we’re playing for everything in the Copa. I have an extraordinary squad at my disposal. I can’t wait for it to start.”\nÁlvaro Arbeloa on the commitment from his players\n“We’ve all seen in recent games how hard they worked in the Super Cup… We have a great squad with players who are willing to give their all. Let’s not forget that we have players who have won six European Cups. That seems to be quickly forgotten. That’s what has made Real Madrid the best club in history.”\nÁlvaro Arbeloa on managing stars\n“It’s not something I worry about. I think we have a squad of great professionals and football players with enormous talent. I think we have a great locker room, and no-one is more interested in winning trophies for Real Madrid than the players. I’ve been there, I know the feeling and the responsibility as a Real Madrid player. I know how that feels and they have to enjoy, be demanding of themselves and work hard. I’ve already seen that in my first day and I’m excited to see more in our first game together.”\nÁlvaro Arbeloa on what went wrong\n“I think we have a long way ahead of us. We have a long way to go in three competitions. Tomorrow in the Copa, then we are in a good position in the league and the Champions League. I focus on having all players available and sharing what we want, but what matters is having happy players and they have to enjoy representing this badge, it’s an honor for them to fight for these titles as the demands of his badge make clear.”\nÁlvaro Arbeloa on what playing well means to him\n“Real Madrid has 123 years of history, and it’s been rare that someone has recognized that we’ve played well. Some have won three Champions League titles and then gone to take care of their garden. I know the demands that we have at this club, and what I want to see as playing well, what our fans want our team to do and play to reflect what we have done throughout history which has given us all the trophies we have. The most important thing is to win.”\nÁlvaro Arbeloa on his relationship with Xabi Alonso\n“Our personal relationship didn’t get in the way of anything. He wished me the best, the same as I would have if it was the other way around. We have a friendship which is above anything else. We spoke yesterday for a good while. He wished me the best and I wish him the best, I’m sure it will go well for him in the future and we’ll be together as we have been for many years.”\nÁlvaro Arbeloa on youth players\n“For me Real Madrid’s youth academy is the best in the world. We’ve shown that for many years. There are players from La Fábrica all around the world. We’ll be lucky enough to play one tomorrow. I’ve played with many over the years. I think it’s the best in the world, the players know that they have an opportunity with a first team coach who knows them better than anyone. Real Madrid is demanding, but I count on them.”\nÁlvaro Arbeloa on Jose Mourinho\n“I knew this question was coming! I haven’t spoken to Jose yet. It was a privilege and an honor to be coached by him, I have a great relationship with him, but I haven’t spoken to him. He has influenced me a lot. I will be Álvaro Arbeloa, I won’t be scared of failure, but if I wanted to be Jose Mourinho then I would fail spectacularly.”\nÁlvaro Arbeloa on coaches influencing him\n“I have had many coaches in very different ways. They were very important in my professional career. They have all influenced me in their own ways. Everyone has their own way of being and tries to take the best from each. Many of the coaches I had are legends and have won everything and gone beyond football, or sport, but it was a privilege to learn from them and I hope I do half as good a job as they did.”\nÁlvaro Arbeloa on Antonio Pintus\n“It’s a privilege to have him here. He’s won five European Cups. He’s one of the best in the world, and he will take care of the fitness work. He knows many of our players well. He has his method, we know how well it has worked here and it’s a pleasure to work with him, learn from him and be alongside him. I’m very lucky, as are the players, to have him here.”\nÁlvaro Arbeloa on referees\n“I haven’t even had a game and you’re asking me about referees! I’m focused on the game tomorrow and preparing the team well for a victory. We are playing to progress in a competition. I am focused on the team, the players and our rival tomorrow. I can see you aren’t so focused!”\nÁlvaro Arbeloa on how he’d handle a Vinícius protest situation\n“I wouldn’t put myself in a situation which hasn’t happened. I’m focused on tomorrow’s game. I’m very lucky to count on Vinícius Júnior, who is a very exciting player and one of the most loved players by fans. We all want to see a Vinícius like on Sunday who can make a difference in a game like a Clásico and is smiling.”\nÁlvaro Arbeloa on what he’s found in training this morning\n“I’ve found a group of players who are very motivated. We have three titles to play for. Despite the efforts in the last week with demanding games, I have seen players very willing to be on the field tomorrow, and they are just as excited as I am to win and fight for everything.”\nÁlvaro Arbeloa on how to reset from Xabi Alonso\n“Obviously all of the players start from scratch with me. That’s evident. I don’t think they’ll ask the Castilla players how I behaved with them, but they can. This is a first game against Albacete tomorrow and a new start with its difficulties of a knock-out tie. The players have shown this excitement to continue the season very well.”",
