I don’t quite know how bad it is. It was enough for him to come off, so that’s a big worry.”\nThe Newcastle boss was unable to add to that at his Friday morning press conference, saying only: “No major update on Anthony. [There's] every chance he’ll miss this game, but we hope it’s not a serious injury and he’ll be back soon.”\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nGordon has been in good form for Newcastle this season with 10 goals and four assists in all competitions - though he has twice as many on both counts in the Champions League as he does in the Premier League. (If you fancy, you could set yourself a little maths question and work out the exact numbers if we also tell you he has a goal and assist apiece in the FA Cup).\nHowe is however a bit more hopeful on a few other big names for the Brentford game.\nHowe indicated that Guimaraes is 'getting closer', adding: “He did a training session on Wednesday and he felt pretty good. I’ll see him today and fingers crossed, he’ll be fit.”\nHe added that Lewis Miley does 'not have a serious injury' and that it is hoped he will be available for action 'soon'.\nNewcastle go into the Brentford game sitting four places behind their opponents in 11th, but thee is only a two point gap between them and Newcastle would leapfrog the Bees with a victory.\nUnited's last Premier League victory came in a dramatic 4-3 win at home to Leeds on January 7.\nSteven Chicken has been working as a football writer since 2009, taking in stints with Football365 and the Huddersfield Examiner.
