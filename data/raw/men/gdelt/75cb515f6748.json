  "body_text": "Former Tottenham winger Aaron Lennon believes Spurs’ silence on Ange Postecoglou’s future indicates that the club are planning to sack the 59-year-old this summer.\nPostecoglou guided Spurs to their first trophy in 17 years with a 1-0 victory over Manchester United in the Europa League final last month.\nHowever, the Australian’s future remains in doubt following Spurs’ woeful Premier League campaign which saw them finish 17th in the table with 22 defeats.\nDuring Spurs’ Europa League trophy parade, Postecoglou indicated that he would be staying on as manager by telling supporters: ‘All the best television series… season three is better than season two.’\nHowever, Lennon feels Spurs’ lack of clarification over Postecoglou’s future suggests a change of manager could happen.\nAsked if Spurs need to clarify Postecoglou’s position, Lennon told talkSPORT: ‘One-hundred per cent, and that’s for everyone, everyone to do with the football club and for the players to know where they’re going.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

A lot of people have been asking me and I’ve been scratching my head about this one.\n‘Because the thing I always take into account is how do I reckon the players are still playing for him, are the players still behind the manager? I do believe that they are.\n‘Normally when a manager is getting sacked or he has lost the dressing room you can see that, you can see the way the team’s playing, you can see it in their interviews after.\n‘But every player I’ve seen is so buzzing about Ange and they’ve always got so much good to say about him.\n‘It’s a difficult one, I wouldn’t be surprised if they got rid of Ange, I wouldn’t be surprised.’\nMore Trending\nLennon also insists Spurs will be making a mistake if they keep delaying a decision over Postecoglou and their summer transfer plans.\n‘For me, if I was a manager and even for the players, it’s so much better to get the players in early,’ the former England winger said.\n‘Get them in that group in pre-season, going on pre-season trips, getting them bonding, especially if they’re coming from different leagues, just to get them settled, their families settled, it’s vital.\n‘For me, Spurs’ squad at the minute is not good enough to play Champions League and to play three games a week at the highest level and then to be pushing up the league where they belong. They need to make investments and make them fast.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Ray Parlour tells ‘great’ Chelsea star to snub shock Arsenal transfer\nMORE: Man Utd make new Bryan Mbeumo offer with final warning to Brentford\nMORE: Liverpool set to sign Armin Pecsi as Golden Boy nominee travels to finalise transfer",
