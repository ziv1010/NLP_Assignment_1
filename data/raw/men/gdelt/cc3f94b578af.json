Managers have won the league and been sacked for not winning the Champions League.\n‘The pressure there is to beat Barcelona and now Atletico Madrid as well, they have the best players and the best manager, you have to win everything or it feels like a failure.\n‘Mbappe knew the scenario before he signed, that’s the life of a top player. If he didn’t want the pressure he should’ve signed for someone else. The higher up the food chain the more pressure there is.\n‘He will have to fire them to the top of the league and the Champions League, but he’s not failed in doing so yet. They have a habit of coming on strong and they’ll go on a great run when everyone is it.\n‘They will be the last team you want to draw in the knockout stages, people have spoken about Real Madrid like they are having a disastrous season, but you’d be very brave to dismiss them now.’\nSpeaking after Manchester City’s Champions League exit, Pep Guardiola described holders Real Madrid as ‘favourites’ but, like Owen, suggested three other teams could pip Los Blancos to the trophy.\nMore Trending\n‘Of course Madrid are a contender, definitely,’ Guardiola said. ‘But there are other good teams around. It will be an interesting Champions League season.\n‘Madrid are always favourites for this trophy. There are other teams who are having a very good season but Madrid are always favourites.\n‘But there are other teams that are playing very well. Liverpool are having a really good season up until now, Barcelona are amazing, Paris Saint-Germain, with my friend Luis [Enrique] in charge, are on the march.\n‘But obviously, Madrid are favourites.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Liverpool star misses training ahead of PSG clash as Luis Enrique reveals gameplan\nMORE: Liverpool can down PSG as cross-Channel rivalry gears up for another thrilling finish\nMORE: Andy Cole snubs Man Utd legends by naming Liverpool icon ‘best finisher ever’",
