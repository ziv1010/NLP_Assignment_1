Otherwise, we won’t go anywhere.’\nOn Arsenal academy graduate Nwaneri, De Zerbi added: ‘Ethan will become a top player, I’m sure about that.\n‘You can see the quality, the impact… he’s so good, same for [fellow January signing] Quinten Timber.’\nDespite joining Marseille on loan, Nwaneri is seen as a future first-team regular by Arsenal, who handed him a new contract until 2030 in the summer.\nBut his game-time dried up in the first-half of the season after Arsenal signed Noni Madueke from Chelsea and Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace.\nExplaining his decision to loan out Nwaneri, Gunners boss Arteta said: ‘I think the talented young players that we have need minutes, and in this case, Ethan wasn’t having enough minutes, and the last thing that we want is to cut his development because he’s such a talent and someone who lives and breathes football; that’s his life.\n‘After discussing it with him, his father, the agent, and the club, we decided the best thing to do was to leave and go on loan.\n‘Then we have to pick the right place, and having all the options, understand the experience that we had in Marseille as well with [William Saliba].\nMore Trending\n‘The fact that Roberto [De Zerbi] is there and he’s an incredible developer of young talent and he’s a really courageous manager in the way he plays, the way he plays with young talent as well and he has a big track record about that.\n‘I think it fits the way of playing for the qualities that we want to see for Ethan. So it’s going to be a great experience for him.’\nNwaneri’s next assignment for Marseille will be a Champions League clash against Club Brugge on Wednesday night.\nMarseille are currently 19th in the Champions League table with the top-eight advancing straight to the knockout stages and the next 16 sides going into a play-off.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Manchester United decide to sign two players to replace Casemiro\nMORE: Chelsea make Cole Palmer transfer decision after Man Utd and Man City links\nMORE: Arsenal vs Man Utd: Predicted lineup today and confirmed team news",
