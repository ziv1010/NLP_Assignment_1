Here, a look at the highest scorers in a season up until the start of the expanded Champions League in 2024/25...\n16.

Neymar\nWith Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi at their brilliant best, only one other player was able to finish as Champions League top scorer between 2008 and 2019.\nThat was Neymar in 2015. The Brazilian scored 10 times for Barcelona en route to the title, and the treble, including one in the final against Juventus in Berlin. But he still finished level with Ronaldo and Messi.\n13. Kaká\nKaká won the Champions League twice as an AC Milan player – in 2003 and 2007 – and finished as a runner-up in 2005 as Liverpool came back from three goals down to win in Istanbul.\nThe Brazlian midfielder scored 10 goals to finish as top scorer in the 2006/07 edition, including three as Milan beat Manchester United 5-3 on aggregate in the semi-finals.\n12.

His son, Rui Águas, also had two spells at Benfica and was joint-top scorer in the European Cup with four goals in 1987/88.\n9. Ferenc Puskás\nOne of the few men to score a hat-trick in a European Cup final and the only one to have achieved it twice, Ferenc Puskás won the trophy three times with Real Madrid.\nThe Hungarian great scored 12 goals in the 1960 European Cup as Real Madrid won the trophy for the fifth time in a row, including four in an incredible 7-3 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the final.\n8.

Karim Benzema\nKarim Benzema played a huge part in Real Madrid's success in the Champions League, winning the competition five times in his 14 seasons at the Santiago Bernabéu.\nOperating in a more sacrificial role due to the presence of Cristiano Ronaldo for much of his time in Madrid, Benzema became more prolific following the departure of the Portuguese. He hit 90 goal in the Champions League overall, including 15 en route to the title in 2021/22.\n3. Robert Lewandowski\nRobert Lewandowski is one of the highest scorers in Champions League history, converting consistently in the competition for Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich and Barcelona.\nThe Polish striker finished as the Champions League's top scorer in 2019/20, netting 15 times in total as Bayern claimed the title.\n2.
