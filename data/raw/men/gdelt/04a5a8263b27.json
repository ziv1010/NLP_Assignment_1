The focus isn’t on any individual, it’s on the group and that’s not going to change.\nMore Trending\n‘There’s always talk when you play for a club like this and you’re involved in a club like this, there’s going to be talk.\n‘But most importantly we need to be close in the changing room, in this training centre and if we’re compact in here then that’ll transfer onto the pitch.\n‘The speculation is speculation, ultimately.
