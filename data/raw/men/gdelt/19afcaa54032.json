  "body_text": "Has Martin lost backing to turn Rangers around?\n- Published\n\"We'll see\".\nThat was the answer Rangers head coach Russell Martin gave when asked if he was certain his board would continue to support him given what was unfolding at Ibrox.\nIt was far from convincing - and in stark contrast to his previous statements where certainty oozed out during what has now descended into a critical mess for the club.\n\"Will you resign?\" he was asked in his press conference, to which he responded with a firm \"no,\" after a fan media representative explained an overwhelming amount of the Rangers support want him to leave.\nThat exchange edged on hostile to say the least.\nThis all came after enduring the quite venomous wrath of a majority of fans, with the 2-0 defeat at home by Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts leaving Martin's side 10th out of the 12 teams after five winless games.\nIt's unthinkable for Rangers and a support given renewed, and long-awaited, hope of challenging Celtic earlier this year after a US-led consortium took control.\nFour draws and now this defeat is beyond a crisis given the demands of being in charge of the club. It's been 47 years since they failed to win any of their opening five league fixtures.\nYou then chuck in a humiliating exit in the Champions League play-off to Club Brugge.\nThe question now, after so much turmoil on and off the park since the former Southampton manager took charge in June, is whether he can turn this around or whether he will be given the opportunity to do so.\nIbrox turns toxic after another nightmare unfolds\nIt was clear at Ibrox that if things didn't go Rangers' way, there was a strong chance the support would be quick to turn, with Martin the focus of their ire.\nIt unfolded exactly like that. Boos were deafening at times and \"sacked in the morning\" was sung by some home supporters.\nMany simply left, it was all too much to bear.\nThe build-up had been dominated by his decision to continue to omit Belgium midfielder Nicolas Raskin despite claiming an issue with the player had been \"resolved\".\nThat issue seems far down the pecking order right now.\n\"Only results will convince them,\" Martin told BBC Scotland afterwards.\n\"My job is to convince the players and the staff inside the building after a difficult afternoon and give them enough support and detail to improve.\n\"It is not going to be an easy journey for me to win favour. It hasn't been from day one with a lot of people, but we'll keep working and make sure it does.\n\"Professionally, it hurts a bit because nobody sees how hard you work.\n\"No-one sees the stuff you have to deal with, but it is what it is and is the job of a football manager.\"\nVictorious Hearts manager Derek McInnes felt compelled to explain how unfair he felt Martin's treatment had been during the match.\nThat perhaps shines a light on how toxic this became.\nFormer Rangers winger Neil McCann was part of Barry Ferguson's interim coaching team last season, and has doubts whether Martin can survive this latest setback.\n\"I'm not sure,\" he said. \"I really felt for him and he looked really uncomfortable at the end of the game.\n\"I know he's not one for walking away but when the fans show their disdain and their displeasure like that then it's really difficult to come through it.\n\"He would have to go on an enormous run to turn that fanbase because they demand better.\"\nCase for the defence?\nMartin has only been in charge for just over three months. It is so early in his tenure and the level of change Rangers required was, and has been, drastic.\nMost observers would recognise that might take time to embed, but time is one thing you don't get at Rangers. Not anymore, at least, after sustained underachievement.\nMartin clearly believes the squad is now there to challenge for the title, but the horse may have already bolted in terms of taking on Celtic, or maybe Hearts given their current nine-point advantage over the Ibrox side. Brendan Rodgers' defending champions visit Kilmarnock on Sunday.\nMartin spoke of \"difficulty managing expectation\" and players \"feeling the weight of it\" as they try to establish themselves.\nHe insisted the pace of change, with a substantial squad overhaul, was required as they were \"not coming into a place that is winning a lot\", referencing a lack of trophies.\nThere does look the basis of a strong squad, but it already seems a long road back for Martin given the level of anger he endured against Hearts and in his post-match exchange.\nWhen you lose the fans, the outcome often becomes inevitable.\n\"The Rangers fans have had enough,\" said Billy Dodds, who was also an assistant to Ferguson last season.\n\"They needed to get results to dampen it all today and they've not done that.\n\"It's not nice when things don't go well at Ibrox. Four draws and a defeat, you're going to come under pressure.\"\nFan views: 'Martin could get Rangers relegated'\nWe asked for Rangers fans to share their thoughts after another dismal outing:\nHere's a selction of their views:\nPaul: This game may well be Russell Martin's last. This cannot go on any more, if there are Rangers fans still in the stands by the end of this debacle I will be surprised. The fans will vote with their feet in their droves. Martin isn't cut out for this, we need someone who knows what they're doing and we need it now!\nBrian: Russell Martin could get us relegated. He's the only person on Earth who thinks this is acceptable.\nBrian: Martin is deluded, heard him say before the game, \"we are in a good place at the moment\". What? After a draw at home with an awful Celtic team? Sack him, he is an embarrassment!\nLee: Martin surely has to go. If you don't have the players to play the way you want you have to adapt. He isn't being a manager he's being a dictator. You can't force players to play in a way that they clearly can't.\nAlex: How many chances does Russell Martin need to get? It is clearly obvious he is out of his depth and cannot manage. It was doubtful before he got the position and now it is firmly confirmed that he is the wrong person for the job.\nJackie: I think Martin needs to be given more time. Can't just keep changing manager after a run of bad results. At some point we have to stick to someone and see it through to the bitter end.\nBaz: I said it after the first game of the season how worried I was about Russell Martin's appointment and how long a season it's going to be. Sadly, I've been proven correct and if he isn't sacked tonight or tomorrow, the crowds will start dropping and the players confidence will get even lower if that's possible.\nGarry: Martin's tactics are the definition of insanity - doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results. No wins, no progress, and no prospect of being the manager by Christmas.\nRelated topics\n- Published18 June 2023",
