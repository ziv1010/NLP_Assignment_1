Under new boss Vincent Kompany, the Bavarians are entering a transitional phase that could define the club's trajectory for years to come. Despite being the biggest name in German football, Bayern's summer has been relatively quiet, with key departures, questionable squad depth, and looming doubts about their top stars. If they're to return to European dominance, serious issues will need addressing quickly.\nTransfer Inactivity Raises Eyebrows\nBayern's summer transfer strategy, or lack thereof, has raised concerns across the fanbase. Despite allowing 11 players to leave, including Mathys Tel, Eric Dier, and Joao Palhinha, only three new faces have come through the door. This has left Kompany with a squad that feels alarmingly thin in key areas, particularly in midfield and defence.\nThe central midfield, once the heartbeat of Bayern's dominance, now looks fragile. Kompany has handed minutes to 17-year-old Lennart Karl, while hoping for a swift return from Aleksandar Pavlovic, who is recovering from surgery on a fractured eye socket. Bischof, at 20, shows potential but lacks experience at the top level. That leaves the bulk of the responsibility on the aging shoulders of Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka.\nKimmich, once hailed as the ideal modern midfielder, came under fire last season for being caught too far forward in transitions. Goretzka, now 30, has lost some of his former mobility, leaving Bayern vulnerable when teams attack at pace. It's an issue that plagued them throughout last season, and with no reinforcements in sight, there's a real danger that it will persist.\nKane's Future in the Balance\nBayern's domestic dominance is rarely in question, but their season will ultimately be judged on the Champions League. That's where Harry Kane comes in. After a prolific debut campaign, the England striker remains central to Bayern's hopes. However, his long-term future at the Allianz Arena is far from secure.\nKane has a EUR74m release clause that becomes active next summer, and rumours are already swirling about a Premier League return--particularly with Manchester United and Liverpool showing interest. Tottenham also hold first option as part of the agreement that brought him to Germany in 2023.\nWith just 47 goals left to surpass Alan Shearer's all-time Premier League scoring record, the pull of English football could prove too strong to resist, especially if Bayern fail to challenge for Europe's top honours. Kane will be 33 by the time the 2026 World Cup wraps up, and it's clear he wants to make the most of his final prime years. Unless Bayern can offer a serious long-term project and silverware, Kane's second season in Munich could be his last.\nDefensive Instability\nWhile Bayern did manage to sign Jonathan Tah from Bayer Leverkusen, arguably the Bundesliga's top defender over the past two seasons, the backline still looks shaky. Tah has immediately taken a starting role ahead of Kim Min-jae, who has struggled to replicate his Napoli form in Munich.\nYet the decision to sideline Kim comes with risk. Although error-prone at times, the South Korean is better suited to Kompany's high-line, aggressive pressing style than Tah, who is more dominant physically but lacks Kim's pace and agility. The duo's chemistry with Dayot Upamecano also remains uncertain, adding another layer of instability.\nEven more problematic is the full-back situation. With Alphonso Davies sidelined until at least October due to an ACL injury, Bayern have had to improvise. Josip Stanisic is filling in at left-back--despite being more comfortable on the right--while Konrad Laimer, a central midfielder by trade, is being used as a right-back. Raphael Guerreiro and Hiroki Ito offer depth, but neither are currently at the top of their game, and neither solve the long-term need for specialist, high-level full-backs.\nKompany's High-Risk Task\nThis chaotic squad composition puts immense pressure on Vincent Kompany. The former Anderlecht and Burnley boss has a clear footballing philosophy: possession-based, high-line, aggressive football. But Bayern's current squad may not be fully suited to that style, especially with ageing midfielders and an unsettled backline.\nKompany's challenge is to implement his vision while simultaneously navigating internal transition, patchy squad depth, and sky-high expectations. With very little room for error, a slow start to the campaign could quickly see the pressure mount--not just from fans and media, but also from within Bayern's famously demanding hierarchy.\nFinal Thoughts\nBayern Munich remain favourites to win the Bundesliga, but that's merely table stakes for Germany's biggest club. The real question is whether they can reassert themselves on the European stage, and early signs suggest they may fall short once again.\nThe squad looks incomplete, key positions lack depth, and Kompany faces a difficult balancing act between youth development and the demand for instant results. If Bayern don't address these issues quickly, they risk not only falling short in the Champions League but also losing their marquee star, Harry Kane, just two seasons after his arrival.\nIn short, Bayern's season could go one of two ways: a smooth, dominant campaign led by a revitalised squad--or a frustrating, underwhelming year marked by missed opportunities and mounting pressure. For now, all eyes are on Kompany to see if he can turn potential pitfalls into a winning project.\nSection: Arts\nSection: Arts\nSection: Fashion\nSection: Politics\nSection: Fashion\nSection: News\nSection: Business\nSection: Fashion\nSection: Business\nSection: Arts\nBoth private Health Insurance in Germany and public insurance, is often complicated to navigate, not to mention expensive.
