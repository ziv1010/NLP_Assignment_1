  "body_text": "FOOTBALL – Bahrain champions Al Khaldiya will learn of their opponents in the round-of-16 knockout stage of the AFC Champions League (ACL) Two when the official draw takes place on Thursday.\nThe event will be held at the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) House in Kuala Lumpur.\nKhaldiya are one of the eight teams from the West region to successfully progress from the group stage. They are also one of four sides who have reached an AFC club competition knockout phase for the first time, with the others being Al Wakrah SC of Qatar, Lion City Sailors FC of Singapore, and Nam Dinh FC of Vietnam.\nThe draw, which will chart the pathway to the final for the contenders, will see the eight teams of the West and East regions placed into two pots – pot one for the group winners and pot two for the runners-up.\nTeams from the same group will not be drawn against each other and this group protection principle will be ensured by the draw software, which will also prevent deadlock situations.\nThe round of 16 is scheduled to be played in February next year, followed by the quarter-finals in March and semi-finals in April, before the tournament culminates in a single-leg final on May 17 next year.\nThe ACL Two is the second-tier club competition of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). Rebranded from the AFC Cup, it is one level below the AFC Champions League Elite and one above the AFC Challenge League.\nKhaldiya advanced to this stage after finishing second in their group during the preliminaries.",
