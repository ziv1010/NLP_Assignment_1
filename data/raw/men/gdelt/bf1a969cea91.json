  "body_text": "Bologna boss Thiago Motta has addressed speculation surrounding his future at the Serie A club even as he continues to be strongly linked with a move to Manchester United.\nMotta has been mentioned as one of the alternatives being explored by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS to potentially replace Erik ten Hag at United.\nIt’s looking increasingly likely that Ten Hag’s time at Old Trafford is up and in preparation for the possibility of his exit, INEOS are believed to be making plans to bring in a successor as soon as possible.\nMotta has earned praise this season for his attractive brand of football and fearless football philosophy, which secured Bologna European football for the first time in more than two decades. Even more impressive is that Bologna will be making their bow in the Champions League.\nMotta is also being eyed by Juventus and AC Milan.\nA recent report covered by The Peoples Person relayed that Juventus offered the former Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan midfielder a three-year deal to assume the hot seat in Turin.\nOn Friday, Juventus announced the sacking of Massimiliano Allegri, two days after the club won the Coppa Italia against Atalanta.\nThe Bianconeri attributed the parting of ways with Allegri to his antics on the touchline on that occasion. Allegri lost his cool in stoppage time as he ripped off his jacket and had an awkward encounter with match officials.\nAmidst interest in his services from outfits like United and Juventus, Motta has now weighed in on his situation and what the future holds for him.\nThe 41-year-old said (via Fabrizio Romano), “I’ll meet with Bologna president in the next few days to make my final decision.”\n“It’s time to decide now, but we’ve to discuss internally and respect all parties involved.”\n🚨 Thiago Motta on his future: “I’ll meet with Bologna president in the next few days to make my final decision”.\n“It’s time to decide now, but we’ve to discuss internally and respect all parties involved”.\n⚪️⚫️ Juventus have offered a three-year deal to Thiago, as reported. pic.twitter.com/8mNltII1ZF\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) May 18, 2024\nIt certainly seems like Juve are in the driving seat to land Motta unless United can make a late push to try to lure him to the Premier League instead.\nIt was after all relayed that Motta’s preference would be to leave Italy in favour of pastures anew abroad. There is a belief that he would be open to coming to England.\nWant to be the first to hear breaking Man United news?
