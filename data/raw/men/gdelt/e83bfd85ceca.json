  "body_text": "How much Kylian Mbappe will earn at Real Madrid compared to his new teammates\nKylian Mbappe has been unveiled as a new Real Madrid player and we’ve checked out how much the French superstar will be earning in comparison to his new teammates.\nThere can be little debate that Mbappe ranks among the best players in the world. From his exceptional record in the Champions League and World Cup to his freakishly good output in Ligue 1, he’s certainly one of the best in the business right now.\nMbappe decided to leave PSG at the end of his seventh season there and Champions League holders Real Madrid managed to finalise a dream deal for the French forward.\nHis new wage package at Real Madrid has been rumoured and we have compared how much Mbappe will be earning in Spain compared to the top 10 earners at the club currently.\nNote: wage figures have been gathered from Capology.\n=9. Eduardo Camavinga (£10.5m annual salary)\nAfter emerging in Ligue 1 with Rennes, Real Madrid bought Eduardo Camavinga in 2021 for the future of their midfield.\nThe Frenchman has progressed well since in a variety of roles, earning a new contract with a pay increase in November 2023.\n=9. Aurelien Tchouameni (£10.5m annual salary)\nA year after adding Camavinga to their midfield, Real Madrid raided France again for Aurelien Tchouameni.\nHe signed a six-year contract in the Spanish capital for a transfer fee worth up to €100m.\n=9. Rodrygo (£10.5m annual salary)\nReal Madrid snapped up a gem from Brazil when they arranged the signing of Rodrygo from Santos. The deal was agreed in 2018 and he arrived in Spain in 2019.\nRodrygo earned a payrise back in November when extending his Real Madrid contract for the long term. However, he might be one of the players fearing for his gametime after Mbappe’s arrival.\n=7. Antonio Rudiger (£12.3m annual salary)\nThe former Chelsea defender is earning a handsome £12.3m at Real Madrid which works out at around £235,000 per week. Rudiger is a regular starter under Carlo Ancelotti and continues to be an important player for the side.\nWith a contract that runs until 2026, it seems more than likely that the 31-year-old will be sticking around in Spain for the foreseeable future. Despite rumours clubs in the Saudi Pro League want to make him the best-paid defender in the world, it is a move he seems to have little interest in.\n=7. Eder Militao (£12.3m annual salary)\nReal Madrid fans didn’t have much of a chance to see Militao in action last season as the defender was recovering from an ACL injury since August 2023.\nThe 26-year-old penned a fresh deal with Real Madrid in January which will keep him at the club until 2028. According to Capology, he will earn an annual salary of £12.3m on his new deal.\n6. Thibaut Courtois (£12.8m annual salary)\nAnother star who missed the majority of the 2023-24 campaign through injury. When fully fit, Courtois is one of the best goalkeepers in the world and his wages reflect this.\nIn the absence of Courtois last season, Andriy Lunin and Chelsea loanee Kepa Arrizabalaga battled for the number-one spot. By next season, Courtois will no doubt reclaim his number one spot.\n5. Federico Valverde (£14m annual salary)\nThere have been some suggestions that one of Real Madrid’s big stars will have to make way for the incoming Mbappe, in order to free up some space on the wage bill.\nOne of the suggestions has been that Valverde could leave, although Real Madrid will surely be reluctant to lose the Uruguayan star.\nThe likes of Chelsea and Man Utd have been linked with Valverde in recent transfer windows, but he seems content enough to stick around in La Liga for the time being.\n=3. Jude Bellingham (£17.5m annual salary)\nSince making the move to the Santiago Bernabeu, Bellingham has been a resounding success. With 23 goals across all competitions, the 21-year-old ranks among the most clinical midfielders in the world.\nHis base salary of £17.5m already makes him one of the highest-paid players at the club. However, if he continues to develop at his current trajectory, he’ll no doubt be in line for a pay rise or two over these next few years.\n=3. Vinicius Junior (£17.5m annual salary)\nUpon Mbappe’s arrival, it will be fascinating to see how he links up with Vinicius. A potential front three of Vinicius, Mbappe and Rodrygo has the potential to be one of the best trios we have ever seen.\nIn October last year, the Brazilian penned a fresh deal with the Spanish giants which keeps him under contract until 2027. On the terms of that deal, he is believed to be earning a handsome annual salary of £17.5m.\n2. David Alaba (£18.9m annual salary)\nAfter joining Real Madrid on a free transfer in 2021, Alaba was handed a highly lucrative contract worth €22.5m a year.\nOver the course of his five-year contract, the 31-year-old will earn around a whopping £95m from Real Madrid.\n1. Kylian Mbappe (£26.3m annual salary)\nEver since Mbappe’s move to Real Madrid started to look more likely, there was widespread speculation about how much his salary would be.\nThere have been varying estimates, some more conservative than others. The latest reports in Spain suggest Real Madrid will pay Mbappe a gross salary in the region of €30m per season.\nBut there are some tasty bonuses in the contract that could as much as double his earnings.\nMbappe is also believed to have received a gigantic signing-on bonus worth €100m or more, and will also keep a larger percentage of his image rights than Real Madrid usually allow.\nREAD MORE: The best Bosman signings Real Madrid have ever made as Kylian Mbappe joins",
