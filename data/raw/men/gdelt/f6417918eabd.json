  "body_text": "NYON (SWITZERLAND) (ITALPRESS) – While waiting for the draw to be finalized, preparations are underway for one of the most anticipated events for football fans across Europe. The draw for this year’s Champions League domestic phase will take place in Monaco on August 28th at 6:00 PM and will follow exactly the same procedure as last year.\nThe 36 participating teams will be divided into four pots based on their individual coefficients, with the Champions League title holder, PSG, seeded in Pot 1. From Pot 1, a physical ball will be drawn before the automated software, already in use last year, will select eight opponents, taking into account the following principles: – Two teams from each of the four pots, with one home and one away match against the teams in each pot drawn at random by the software. – No team from the same association will be drawn against another. – No more than two opponents from the same association. The same procedure will be repeated for all other teams until all pairings have been drawn. The Champions League match schedule, including dates and kick-off times, will be announced by Saturday, August 30th.\nHowever, something changes for the Europa and Conference League draws. “This season’s new feature,” UEFA emphasizes, “is that for the first time the draws will be combined into a single special show, broadcast live from the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco, simplifying the content and maximizing the impact of both draws. The event will take place at 1 p.m. on Friday, August 29. The two draws will be conducted in a fully digital format, using the same digital technology used last year to instantly draw the opponents, allowing for a smooth, efficient, and fast draw process. The software will be the same as already in use. Thanks to its flexibility, the system can draw the opponents for all teams one after the other—as in the Champions League—or draw all the pairings instantly with the press of a button. The latter will be the case for the Europa League and the Conference League. No physical balls will be used on stage. The draw button is pressed once at the start of both draws, thus activating the random selection of opponents, including home and away teams. The teams will know all their opponents by the end of the draw. of the draws, however the match schedules with the dates and start times will be drawn up later and communicated no later than Sunday 31 August.\n-Photo IPA Agency-\n(ITALPRESS).",
