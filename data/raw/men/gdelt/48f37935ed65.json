The Reds have a long-term interest in the winger.\nTEAMtalk’s transfer correspondent, Fraser Fletcher, reported on June 4 that Liverpool were keen on a 2025 summer deal for Gordon.\nSources told TEAMtalk at the time that while Gordon was ‘not agitating to leave St James Park’, the winger ‘would be very keen on the move back to Merseyside, viewing Anfield as a dream destination’.\nLiverpool wanted to sign Gordon from Premier League rivals Newcastle in the summer of 2024 as well.\nWith Newcastle facing PSR issues at the time, talks over a move to Liverpool were at an advanced stage.\nHowever, with Yankuba Minteh joining Brighton instead, Gordon stayed at Newcastle and signed a new contract in October 2024 with ‘a release clause’, according to The i Paper.\nLiverpool fans will know everything there is to know about how good Gordon is, and the Anfield faithful will be encouraged to read what the great Jose Mourinho thinks of him.\nGordon played against Benfica in the Champions League in midweek, and after the game, the Newcastle winger revealed what the Portuguese club’s manager told him.\nThe winger told BBC Sport: “He said: ‘You’re too much’, which is a big compliment for me because as a kid, he was my favourite manager in the world.\n“It’s quite weird because he was quite a defensive manager, but I just love the way, even then, the bench was getting up [to celebrate].\n“He really creates a team environment – it’s like us against the world. I recognise that from my own game, so it was a big compliment.\n“It means an awful lot. Even if I hadn’t idolised him, a compliment from any coach at this level means a lot.”\nGordon is also a Liverpool fan and said in a televised episode of Sky panel show A League of Their Own: “I have no family members who support Everton. None, not one.\n“All Liverpool, so it was quite strange. So I was at Liverpool and they released me at 11, and then Everton signed me.\n“As long as they lost it was alright. Like, if I ever scored, they were like, ‘if you score great, but we still want you to lose’.\n“My family are really, really bitter Liverpool fans.”\nIn April 2024, Gordon said on The Overlap: “Steven Gerrard was my football hero growing up.\n“Coming from Liverpool, he was like a God in Liverpool, and he was an unbelievable player.”\nLatest Liverpool transfer news: Semenyo revelation, El Clasico scouting mission\nMeanwhile, Sepp van den Berg has revealed what Arne Slot told him before he left Liverpool.\nSources have told TEAMtalk’s transfer insider, Dean Jones, whether Liverpool would be able to sign forward Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth in the January transfer window.\nAnd finally, Liverpool will scout two Real Madrid midfielders in El Clasico against Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday.",
