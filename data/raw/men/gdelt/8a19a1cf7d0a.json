Now we need a crisis at City and Arsenal.\n“And we need to win football games. Because if they start losing all the games and we do what we did tonight, nothing changes.\n“And we are not safe in the Champions League [places] either, so we should just play better football. That would be really good.”\nWhen speaking to Sky Sports later, Klopp was asked again about their title chances.\n“That must happen a lot. They must come in a very bad moment, Arsenal and Man City, and actually yesterday it didn’t look like that,” he said in reference to Arsenal’s thumping 5-0 win over Chelsea.\n“I don’t know [if we’re still in the race]. I can only apologise to the people. Everybody who is with us knows how hard this is for us as well, but I know for other people it’s especially hard. So we should have done better but we didn’t and that’s why we lost.”\nSpeaking to Match of the Day, Klopp added: “Arsenal didn’t look very weak last night. We have to play better, that is it. We need points. We are not safe in the Champions League. Tottenham have played a lot of games less than us.”\nCarragher blames Liverpool duo for Everton defeat\nCarragher, meanwhile, was unhappy with Liverpool’s performance on the night and felt two players in particular let the Reds down at the home of their arch-rivals.\nCasting the blame at Liverpool’s defensive showing, Carragher then went on to point the finger at Ibrahima Konate for his efforts in keeping Everton out.\n“How many times have Liverpool given free kicks away? I mean, that is the name of the game for Everton,’ the Reds legend said on Sky Sports. “Liverpool need to sign a new defender because he’s not been good enough.\n“Everton have been fantastic, certainly with the set pieces, they’ve looked like scoring on every single one.\n“The amount of times Liverpool have given fouls away in their own half and Konate, what is he doing?! He doesn’t know where he is. He just sticks a leg out at it.\nREAD MORE ~ Next Liverpool manager’s to-do list: Five major tasks for Klopp successor, from contracts to transfers\n“But Everton definitely deserved to go in front and deserved to get a goal from a set piece.”\nKonate was subbed off after 63 minutes for Jarell Quansah, but the French defender was not the only player to be blamed for the defeat, with Argentina midfielder Alexis Mac Allister – often so reliable for Liverpool this season – also coming in for some strong criticism.\n“The naivety of Liverpool in terms of how you play a derby game. They got away with one with the penalty.\n“Forget this game, whenever you come to Goodison as a Liverpool player, there’s two rules that you’ll always do: You don’t give silly fouls away and get the crowd up, and you move the ball on quickly and don’t let tackles come in.\n“Mac Allister in midfield, who has been fantastic for Liverpool this season, he’s given so many fouls away and he’s taking too long on the ball and he’s allowing people to tackle them and it lifts the crowd.”",
