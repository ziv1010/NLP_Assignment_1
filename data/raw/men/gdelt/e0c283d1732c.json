I’d say about 80% of the squad is injury free, so I am happy with how our preparations have gone,” he said.\nAgainst Shosholoza, Doeseb scored a brace and Trent and Kulula one goal each, while their other scorers were Godwin Eiseb (two), Gianluca Kahingunga and Turipamwe Mbongora.\nBesides them, their squad is a fine mix of youth and experience with exciting newcomers like Kahingunga, Vevengapi Mbuende, Edmar Kamatuka and Jackson Eliakim vying for places alongside experienced campaigners like Charles Hambira, Ronald Ketjijere and Vitapi Ngaruka.\nMafoso said he expected a strong challenge from Vipers.\n“They compete in the Champions League just about every season and they regularly win the Ugandan league. In general Ugandan players are known for their athleticism and they are runners, so they will be tough opponents,” he said.\n“Four or five of their players haven’t played in the pre-season yet, and they also have a new coach, so they are a bit of a closed book. But the draw could have been worse and I’d say it’s quite open and anyone can win – we must just work on our finer details,” he added.\nThe return leg match will take place at St Mary’s Stadium in Kitende, Uganda on 27 September.\nIn an age of information overload, Sunrise is The Namibian’s morning briefing, delivered at 6h00 from Monday to Friday.
