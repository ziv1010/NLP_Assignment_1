  "body_text": "Ruben Amorim has been backed to make a return to management in the summer, replacing another former Manchester United boss when he does so.\nAmorim was sacked as Red Devils boss in January after an underwhelming spell in charge since November 2024.\nThe Portuguese took charge of 63 games and won just 24 of them, leaving with a win percentage of just 38.10.\nHis departure has not enhanced his reputation either, with Michael Carrick quickly improving things for Manchester United, winning four and drawing one of his first five games in interim charge.\nThe 41-year-old will not see his managerial career end with failure at Old Trafford, though, and is expected to be back in charge of a big club next season.\nHe was touted as one of the best young coaches in Europe when he moved from Sporting to Manchester United and memories of his success in Portugal have not entirely faded.\nIt is a return to his homeland that is being talked up, with ESPN expecting Amorim to return to the club at which he had most success as a player.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nAmorim played for Benfica from 2008-15, winning there Primeira Liga titles and picking up all 14 of his Portugal caps while he was at the club.\nCurrently in charge of Benfica is Jose Mourinho, who took the reigns in September last year after leaving Fenerbahce.\nIt hasn’t been entirely plain sailing on his return to Portugal, but a 4-2 win over Real Madrid in the Champions League, with a stoppage time goal from their goalkeeper sending them into the play-offs, will live long in the memory.\nThe ESPN report states that Mourinho is expected to be offered the chance to take over as Portugal boss after the World Cup, with current manager Roberto Martinez’s contract expiring after the tournament.\nShould the 63-year-old accept the offer, which he is expected to do, then Amorim will be the prime target to take over at the Estadio da Luz.\nGiven his standing at the club from his playing days, Amorim reportedly has ‘significant support among the club’s decision-makers,’ which would make Benfica his most likely route back into management.\nAs for Amorim’s permanent replacement at Manchester United, that story took a twist on Thursday morning as it was announced that Thomas Tuchel had extended his contract as England manager.\nMore Trending\nThe German was one of the favourites to take over from Carrick in the summer, but that seems much less likely after he signed up to be in charge of the Three Lions until 2028.\n‘I am very happy and proud to extend my time with England,’ Tuchel said in a statement, having initially only signed up to take charge of one major tournament.\n‘It is no secret to anyone that I have loved every minute so far of working with my players and coaches, and I cannot wait to lead them to the World Cup.\n‘It is an incredible opportunity and we are going to do our very best to make the country proud.’\nMan Utd manager for first game of the 2026/2027 season odds\nMichael Carrick 10/11\nOliver Glasner 5/1\nGareth Southgate 6/1\nJulian Nagelsmann 14/1\nLuis Enrique 20/1\nOle Gunnar Solskjær 22/1\nCarlo Ancelotti 22/1\nAndoni Iraola 25/1\nRoberto de Zerbi 25/1\nMauricio Pochettino 25/1\nNuno Espirito Santo 25/1\nThomas Tuchel 25/1\nOdds courtesy of SkyBet\nMORE: Gary Neville says Arsenal and Chelsea should have signed £65m Man Utd star\nMORE: Manchester United urged to raid Barcelona for ‘very good’ Casemiro replacement\nMORE: Joe Cole responds to claims Chelsea made ‘mistake’ signing Manchester United star",
