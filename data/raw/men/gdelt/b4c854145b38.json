  "body_text": "Zinedine Zidane’s son, Luca, has come under scrutiny following his involvement in a post-match brawl after Algeria’s 2-0 defeat to Nigeria in the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals on Saturday, PUNCH Sports Extra reports.\nThe 27-year-old Granada goalkeeper was at the centre of unsavoury scenes at full-time, clashing with Nigeria midfielder Fisayo Dele-Bashiru as tensions boiled over following Algeria’s elimination.\nWhat began as a heated verbal exchange quickly escalated into a shoving match, drawing in players and staff from both teams and bringing a sour end to the contest.\nLuca Zidane was seen confronting Dele-Bashiru before Nigeria players intervened to pull their teammate away, while the goalkeeper also exchanged words with Club Brugge midfielder Raphael Onyedika as the situation threatened to spiral further.\nThe altercation overshadowed an otherwise poor performance by the Dessert Warriors, as the Super Eagles secured their semi-final place with goals from Victor Osimhen and Akor Adams and will now face hosts Morocco in the last four.\nAlgeria had entered the quarter-final with confidence after a flawless group stage campaign, recording victories over Sudan, Burkina Faso and Equatorial Guinea, before edging past DR Congo 1-0 in the round of 16.\nHowever, Nigeria proved a step too far, limiting the North Africans’ attacking threat and asserting dominance to seal progression.\nReaction on social media was swift, with fans expressing shock at the chaotic scenes that followed the final whistle.\nNigerian journalist Tobi Adepoju wrote on X, “Like father, like son. It’s a Zidane family template,” while referencing the wider disorder that followed the match.\nAnother user, @john322226, echoed the sentiment, posting, “Zinedine zidane son was fighting after the match against Nigeria. Like father, like son.”\nOthers were more critical of Luca Zidane’s conduct.\nOne fan described the incident as a disgrace, while another said emotions had overwhelmed the players.\nA separate post claimed the goalkeeper would “never forget this day” after what was described as a humiliating end to Algeria’s campaign.\nLuca switched international allegiance earlier this year, opting to represent Algeria after previously being eligible for France, the country of his legendary father.\nHe made his international debut in October 2025 and was included in the AFCON squad soon after.\nA product of the Real Madrid academy, Zidane won the Champions League as part of the squad managed by his father during the 2017–18 season, although he made only two senior appearances for the club before leaving permanently for Rayo Vallecano in 2020.\nHe has since built a solid career in Spain’s second tier with spells at Rayo, Eibar and current club Granada, making 194 senior appearances in all competitions.\nWhile he has forged a respectable path away from his father’s shadow, the scenes at full-time in Morocco are likely to leave Luca Zidane reflecting on a moment when frustration overtook discipline, as his return to club football follows a disappointing and controversial end to his first major tournament with Algeria.",
