The match meant little for Spain because it had already secured its spot at Euro 2024. Local reports said Barcelona was considering making a formal complaint to the Spanish football federation.\nDe la Fuente said the Gavi injury was one of the “toughest” moments of his coaching career but noted that it had nothing to do with the knock he received earlier.\n“This can happen at any time. It was an accident,” De la Fuente said. “It’s a very difficult moment. It’s difficult for him, his club, his teammates, for me and for the federation. We are devastated.”\nDe la Fuente rested some of the other regular starters who had played in the team’s 3-1 win at Cyprus on Thursday, but the 19-year-old Gavi started again after playing the entire match last week.\nClubs receive financial compensation when their players get injured with their national team and miss more than 28 days, but Gavi’s absence will be felt by Barcelona because he was one of the key players in coach Xavi Hernandez’s squad that this season is on track to play in the knockout rounds of the Champions League after two consecutive eliminations in the group stage.\nMadrid, already in the next round of the Champions League and fighting for the Spanish league lead, will be without Vinícius for about two months because of a muscle tear the forward sustained in Brazil’s 2-1 loss at Colombia in World Cup qualifying on Friday. The 23-year-old Vinícius has scored six goals for Madrid this season, including three in the team’s last two matches.\nMadrid coach Carlo Ancelotti will also be without Camavinga for some time. The 21-year-old midfielder tore a ligament in his right knee while practicing with the French national team. Camavinga started all four of Madrid’s Champions League games and appeared in all 13 of its Spanish league matches this season.\nAnother Spanish club affected was Real Sociedad, which saw midfielder Mikel Oyarzabal — one of the key players for the sixth-place club in the Spanish league — leave Spain’s match against Cyprus with a muscle injury.",
