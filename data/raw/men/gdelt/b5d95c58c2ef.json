Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Chelsea the three other heavyweight clubs to show interest in a player released by the latter's academy aged 14.\nWest Ham are yet to respond to City's offer, which sources have confirmed to 90min does not include Kalvin Phillips in any way. The England international has struggled to command regular minutes at the Etihad Stadium following his £42m move from Leeds United, and is one of a number of players being eyed to potentially replace Rice.\nThe Hammers also hold an interest in Fulham's Joao Palhinha, who impressed in his maiden Premier League season after opting to leave Portuguese giants Sporting CP.\nLISTEN NOW\nOn this week's edition of Talking Transfers, part of the 90min podcast network, Toby Cudworth is joined by Graeme Bailey and Sean Walsh to discuss the latest transfer news. On the agenda is Arsenal's approach for Jurrien Timber, Kai Havertz and Declan Rice, the exodus of Chelsea players to Saudi Arabia, Moises Caicedo, Kyle Walker, Man Utd's goalkeeper plans & more!\nIf you can't see this embed, click here to listen to the podcast!",
