He could not continue playing. So, [it is a] bit of a worry.’\nIn his post-match press conference, Arteta added: ‘I don’t know the extent [yet]. But it’s not great news.’\nChris Sutton, meanwhile, who saw Calafiori suffer the injury in real time while on commentary duties, said: ‘I’m not a medical expert, but that doesn’t look good for Riccardo Calafiori.\n‘His right knee, he is put off balance and slips. Then it’s awkward the way he goes down. He tweaks his right knee. This is a real concern for Arsenal [with] all the talk of the big game at the weekend.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

He can play in the midfield role, he has the awareness for that.\n‘Calafiori will be a massive loss at the weekend. Arsenal need to find a way of muddling their way through.\n‘Tonight it is job done. There will be disappointment as Mikel Arteta would have liked things easier, but this is top level Champions League football. Arsenal are still a force.’\nCalafiori’s absence against Liverpool would be a significant blow given Arsenal are already without William Saliba while there are question marks over Bukayo Saka’s fitness too.\nMore Trending\nArteta cannot confirm if Saka will be ready to face Liverpool on Sunday after he missed the win over Shakhtar Donetsk.\nQuizzed on Amazon Prime if Saka was close to returning against Shakhtar Donetsk, Arteta said: ‘He wasn’t able to do the session in the way we wanted. He still isn’t feeling good. It wasn’t good news.’\nAsked if Saka would return against Liverpool on Sunday, Arteta added: ‘At the moment, I am not very helpful. Let’s see. We still have a few days. I don’t know. He wasn’t able to train yet so that’s unlikely.’\nArsenal currently sit third in the Premier League on 17 points after their opening eight games of the season. Arne Slot’s Liverpool, meanwhile, are top with 21 points, narrowly ahead of second-placed Manchester City.\nMORE: Fabio Capello urges Bayern Munich star to retire after Barcelona defeat\nMORE: Danny Welbeck injury ‘very painful’ as Fabian Hurzeler details nerve issue\nMORE: Martin Odegaard injury return ‘going to plan’ ahead of three huge Arsenal games",
