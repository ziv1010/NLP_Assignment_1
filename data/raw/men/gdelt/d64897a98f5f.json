  "body_text": "Manchester United should certainly look to bolster their centre back options with at least one signing this summer.\nThe Red Devils clearly need to focus on improving their attack and reports suggest that they are targeting striker and number 10 profiles such as Matheus Cunha.\nUnited will certainly have financial limitations this summer but with the side taking a three goal lead on aggregate back to Old Trafford in the semi-final of the Europa League against Athletic Club, they will be hopeful of progressing and winning the final. This would be a huge boost to their ability to spend and attract players this summer as a victory would ensure Champions League qualification.\nIn addition, the fine form of Antony and improved efforts of Marcus Rashford will give the club hope that they can raise significant funds from the sale of both players.\nRuben Amorim has been steadfast in his tactical approach of playing three centre backs, therefore United will need to have a strong selection to choose from.\nThe problem is that they do not have many players in their prime at this position. Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof are both slated to be leaving this summer at the end of their contracts.\nWhat’s more, Lisandro Martinez picked up yet another serious injury in February and looks like he will be out of action until well into next season. There have also been doubts that Amorim sees the Argentine as a long-term part of his back three.\nMatthijs de Ligt has impressed in his debut season at Old Trafford but had a reputation of being injury prone before his arrival at the club. He has managed to play 42 games this season but he was injured in March and had to be subbed off yesterday before half-time in only his second game after his return from the treatment table.\nLuke Shaw is also an option but he has never truly been able to stay fit for long periods of time and that is unlikely to change as he approaches his thirties.\nTherefore, United have Harry Maguire who is 32 years old and despite a renaissance, is not suddenly the answer at centre back for the club. Leny Yoro looks a shrewd signing who has gone from strength to strength. Nonetheless, he is still just 19 years old and needs time to grow.\nAyden Heaven and Tyler Fredricson have both started games this season and have largely impressed, even though the latter had his struggles in yesterday’s 3-4 defeat to Brentford.\nHeaven in particular looks a real prospect and will surely get more first team opportunities if he can recover from a knock before the season finishes in 20 days. Both players are very inexperienced however, and it is not fair to expect them to be major contributors to a consistent team yet.\nUnited clearly do not have the finances to spend big in this area but they can certainly attempt to bring in an experienced head. De Ligt and Martinez are the only defenders currently at the ideal age profile of their mid-twenties.\nNobody is denying that United don’t have some serious talent in defence but many of the youngsters need guidance over the course of a gruelling season.\nThe Red Devils have been linked to Jonathan Tah on a free this summer and the 29 year old could certainly be a good option to bolster the backline.\nUnited could also look to add an experienced head from the Premier League or La Liga, especially if they manage to qualify for the Champions League and need to negotiate more games.\nRuben Amorim has already claimed that his squad is not ready yet to be competitive in both competitions so a signing in the defence would only help.\nThe former Sporting CP boss may also look to his old side as United have been previously linked to moves for Goncalo Inacio and Ousmane Diomande.\nNonetheless, these two options may be beyond United’s spending capabilities this summer. While the Red Devils do have some exciting prospects in the centre of defence, it is vital they pick up at least one experienced head, especially if they are playing European football in the next campaign.\nFeatured image Lars Baron via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
