They are looking to bring in Joao Cancelo from Manchester City on an initial loan, while Atletico Madrid's Joao Felix is also a target.\n90min reported earlier this week that one player who could leave Barcelona to free up room on their wage bill is Fati. 90min understands that his agent, Jorge Mendes, has informed Europe's top clubs that the winger is open to a move prior to the deadline.\nREAD MORE FROM 90MIN'S TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM\nThis has alerted several Premier League clubs, with Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur all taking an interest, while Aston Villa are also keen. However, they are not totally convinced that the 20-year-old is indeed willing to leave Barcelona and so are only taking small steps towards a potential deal at this stage.\nArsenal will play Champions League football this season for the first time in six years and extra attacking depth wouldn't go amiss.\nNorth London rivals Tottenham are looking for a wide player and are leading the race for Nottingham Forest's Brennan Johnson, while Jota - who worked under head coach Ange Postecoglou at Celtic - is also an option. Fati scored against Spurs in a pre-season friendly earlier in August.\nOver in west London, Chelsea are on the hunt for another forward this week. 90min revealed on Tuesday they could yet rival Barcelona for Felix, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Stamford Bridge.\nLISTEN NOW TO 90MIN'S TALKING TRANSFERS PODCAST\nOn this edition of Talking Transfers, part of the 90min podcast network, Scott Saunders is joined by Toby Cudworth and Graeme Bailey to discuss Man Utd's links to Marc Cucurella and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Romelu Lukaku's impending exit from Chelsea, West Ham's attempts to revive a deal for Harry Maguire & more!\nIf you can't see this embed, click here to listen to the podcast!",
