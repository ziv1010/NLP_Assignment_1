Schlager, a versatile and energetic central midfielder with 49 caps for Austria, has been a reliable performer for Leipzig since his £12million move from Wolfsburg in 2022.\nThis term, he has featured regularly in the Bundesliga, contributing two goals in 15 appearances.\nSources indicate that Celtic made enquiries about a possible mid-season switch, with Leipzig said to be open to a modest fee of around £6m (€7m / $8m) to avoid losing him for nothing later.\nMartin O’Neill’s side viewed the player as a potential boost to their midfield options.\nHowever, Juventus have surged ahead in the pursuit. The Turin club are at an advanced stage in negotiations for a pre-contract agreement that would see Schlager arrive on a free transfer in July.\nJuventus, seeking to strengthen their engine room under their current management, see Schlager as an ideal addition given his experience in high-level competitions, including the Champions League.\nRB Leipzig are also open to extending. Indeed, sporting director Marcel Schafer recently confirmed positive discussions with Schlager over a potential contract extension, but a move to Juventus is seen as attractive.\nSchlager himself is understood to be weighing up his options carefully, with no firm commitment yet to extend his stay in Germany.\nWant more breaking transfer lines from original sources?

We revealed Celtic made an enquiry for the 22-year-old on January 20.\nAlthough, Redzic has greenlit a transfer to Red Bull Salzburg, and they are working to beat Celtic to a deal.\nCeltic transfer news: Lethal striker eyed; winger hijack\nCeltic launch move for deadly striker who dunked on Man City – he could decide SPL title race\nMartin O’Neill pushing Celtic to hijack Stoke City deal for explosive winger",
