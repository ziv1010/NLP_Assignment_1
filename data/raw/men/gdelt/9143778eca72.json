But he is back now and he is doing really well in training, so if you can’t give him perspective then I can see he has to play for his career and for everything.\"\nAnd Turkish giants Galatasaray, one of United's rivals in the Champions League this season, could be set to end the Dutchman's difficult spell in Manchester.\nAccording to a report in Turkish outlet Sporx, discussions took place while United were in Istanbul for the 3-3 draw against Galatasaray in the Champions League in midweek.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nVan de Beek is under contract at United until 2025, with the option of an additional year.\nThe midfielder has also admitted he may have to move in the near future as he seeks regular playing time.\n\"I need to start playing games very soon – if not at Man United then at another club,\" he said last week. \"I think I have to be ambitious. I have always been a lover of the game. I am absolutely crazy about football.\n\"I earn a good living at United, but money is not my motivation. I want to enjoy my work every day.\"\nMeanwhile, Football Insider claim United are in the market for another defensive midfielder in January, with Sofyan Amrabat yet to convince coaching staff at Old Trafford since signing on loan from Fiorentina in the summer.\nMore Manchester United stories\nManchester United preparing sensational swoop for £130m man: report\nManchester United's four-man winter wishlist revealed, with Erik ten Hag making big statement signings: report\nTottenham Hotspur to hijack Manchester United's main transfer target: report\nBen Hayward is a European football writer and Tottenham Hotspur fan with over 15 years’ experience, he has covered games all over the world - including three World Cups, several Champions League finals, Euros, Copa America - and has spent much of that time in Spain.
