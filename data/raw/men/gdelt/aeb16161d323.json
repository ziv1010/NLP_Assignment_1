  "body_text": "Blame it on Marcus Rashford arriving late, but I have a feeling Ferran Torres would have started this game against Getafe either way.\nBarcelona make easy work of Getafe as Hansi Flick pulls the right strings\nThe Blaugrana manager is showing his ability to influence games\nHansi Flick has been making all the right calls lately. From the rotations in his starting lineups, to the in-game management, the Blaugrana manager is showing he knows how to set up his team for success against a diversity of opponents.\nIt’s no surprise that Rashford was the man of the match against Newcastle. It was a game in a specific atmosphere, against an opponent that was going to allow for opportunities he could exploit.\nGetafe is Getafe. You are never going to watch a pretty game when they’re on the field. Under José Bordalás, you can double on that. Rashford had success off the bench because Barcelona had already pulled ahead. If you had started him, I think he would have struggled to make an impact.\nFerran Torres, however, was the perfect man for the occasion. But of course, changing Rashford for Torres isn’t like for like. Ferran is almost always a center forward under Flick. In this game, he was joined by Robert Lewandowski and Dani Olmo. Together, they were a handful for the Getafe defense.\nThis was not a game for the Barca wingers to shine. Lamine Yamal was out, Raphinha was benched at half-time, and Rashford wasn’t needed from the jump.\nFlick understood that he needed players who could play between the lines, intelligent disrupters off the ball. The opening goal was not an accident. It was the manifestation of the coach getting the players and the tactics right.\nWell done Ferran Torres, the best player on the night. Well done Hansi Flick for putting him in a position to succeed.\nBeyond that, Flick is doing an excellent job of rotating players, giving everyone across the roster a chance to play and contribute, sending the message that in order for Barcelona to achieve their ambitious goals, everyone will have to be involved. He is planting seeds that will blossom as the season grows.\nWithout Lamine Yamal, Barcelona not only hasn’t skipped a beat, they’re starting to play their best football.\nThere will be tough tests ahead, but for now Flick is laying a solid foundation. He counts on everyone, and that makes for a great team culture, and a positive atmosphere that keeps the collective invested in the common mission.\nMost important, he is making the right calls at the right moments. It’s not rotation for the sake of it. It’s knowing which players are better suited in which games.\nIt’s not thrilling football we’re watching at the moment, but the performances are very satisfying in how easy they’re making things look.\nThis is the way forward, because Real Madrid will be a tough rival to keep pace with this season.\nWhoever commits the fewer unforced errors will likely be the one who comes out on top.\nThat starts with the managers.\nThe Hansi Flick versus Xabi Alonso virtual chess match will be a fun one to watch week to week.",
