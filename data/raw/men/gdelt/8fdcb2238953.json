  "body_text": "Antonio Conte's stance on Tottenham future ahead of contract expiry\nAntonio Conte is not expected to commit his long-term future to Tottenham Hotspur with his contract set to expire at the end of the season, 90min understands.\nThe Italian first joined Spurs in November 2021 as a replacement for Nuno Espirito Santo, who only lasted four months in the job after Conte initially turned it down that summer.\nHe managed to steer Tottenham to a fourth-placed finish in his debut season, overtaking rivals Arsenal during the penultimate week of the campaign and cementing his popularity among supporters.\nBut what was meant to be a 2022/23 season spent challenging for honours has not panned out that way. Spurs are involved in another dogfight to finish in the top four and were recently knocked out of the FA Cup at the fifth round stage by Championship opposition for a second season running.\nSources have told 90min that Conte and Spurs are expected to part ways come the end of his current contract, despite the club retaining an option to extend it by another 12 months.\nREAD NEXT\nThe two parties tried to thrash out a new deal earlier this season, but they were not able to reach an agreement and one has never been close.\nConte has spent much of the last month recovering at home in Italy following gallbladder surgery, and while his absence has complicated negotiations, talks had not been ongoing leading up to that point anyways.\nHe will return to the touchline for Tottenham's crunch Champions League last 16 second leg against AC Milan on Wednesday night. Spurs trail 1-0 from the first leg and Conte has not won a knockout tie in this competition in 10 years.\nShould Conte leave Tottenham, 90min understands that Mauricio Pochettino would be interested in returning to the club. The Argentine, who led Spurs to their first and only Champions League final, is out of work after leaving PSG last summer.\nThe long-term future of managing director of football Fabio Paratici is also in doubt. He recently received a 30-month ban from Italian football for financial irregularities and false accounting while at Juventus, with the FIGC looking to extend this to a worldwide suspension.",
