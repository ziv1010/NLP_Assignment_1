  "body_text": "Manchester United have joined the race to sign Bayer Leverkusen’s attacking sensation Victor Boniface, setting the stage for a potential transfer battle with Chelsea, PUNCH Sports Extra reports.\nThe 23-year-old Nigerian striker has been in scintillating form since joining the German club in the summer of 2023, attracting the attention of several top European sides.\nBoniface’s impressive debut season saw him score 21 goals and provide 10 assists in 34 appearances, playing a crucial role in Leverkusen’s historic Bundesliga triumph that ended Bayern Munich’s long-standing dominance.\nThe forward’s stellar performances continued into the new season, notching seven goals and five assists in just eight Bundesliga appearances. He also recently opened his UEFA Champions League account with a decisive strike against AC Milan.\nAccording to Fichajes, both Manchester United and Chelsea are prepared to battle for Boniface’s signature, with the striker’s potential transfer fee estimated between €60 and €80m.\nDespite having recently signed young strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, Manchester United are still keen on bolstering their attacking options. The Red Devils view Boniface as a player who could provide the additional firepower they need upfront.\nChelsea, on the other hand, have been in the market for a world-class striker for some time. The Blues’ transfer strategy aligns with Boniface’s profile, as they focus on acquiring the best young talents in world football.\nBoniface’s current contract with Leverkusen runs until the summer of 2028, putting the German club in a strong negotiating position. The striker himself appears to be in no rush to leave, focussing on his performances for Xabi Alonso’s side.\nAs the January transfer window approaches, all eyes will be on the Nigeria international’s future, with both Manchester United and Chelsea poised to make a move for one of European football’s most exciting young talents.",
