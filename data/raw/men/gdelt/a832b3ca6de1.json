  "body_text": "Manchester United return to Premier League action with the end of the season in sight. Ruben Amorim’s side will be expected to get some good results under their belt, especially with the UEFA Europa League semi final first leg on the horizon. United have been uninspiring in the league this season but there is a glimmer of hope.\nUnited are out of the race for European football next season due to their lowly league position but winning the Europa League would see them in the UEFA Champions League next season, which would be quite funny to see. United are the only team in a European competition to be undefeated this season, which is a good thing.\nIt is a shame that this form was not in display in the Premier League this season. Amorim seems to be the right man for the job as he has made some positive changes at the Old Trafford club which will create a foundation for the club going forward. Blooding in talented youth players will be a major positive this season.\nManchester United\nOnana;\nShaw, Maguire, Yoro;\nMazraoui, Casemiro, Mainoo, Dorgu;\nGarnacho, Fernandes;\nHojlund\nSubstitutes\nHeaton; Lindelof, Evans, Amass, Fredricson; Mount, Eriksen, Ugarte; Obi\nBournemouth\nKepa;\nSmith, Zabarnyi, Huijsen, Kerkez;\nScott, Adams;\nOuattara, Kluivert, Semenyo;\nEvanilson\nSubstitutes\nDennis, Senesi, Soler, Araujo, Hill, Brooks, Tavernier, Cook, Jebbison\nUnited and Bournemouth have met each other 23 times in all competitions during the history of both clubs. United have won 14 times, drawn four times and lost five times. United have failed to beat Bournemouth in the last three meetings, losing 3-0 twice and also drawing 2-2. It was the 20 May 2023 when United last beat Bournemouth.\nThe Old Trafford club have a number of players out of action for this match, which is not going to help matters – especially with a UEFA Europa League semi final first leg clash with Bilbao on the horizon. But Ruben Amorim’s side will have to overcome the challenge of the South Coast club and try and get a win away from home.\nUnited have been largely poor in the Premier League this season, losing 15 matches already this season – seven of which were away from home. United have ten wins and eight draws to their name this season, which is the worst season United have faired in the English top flight in the Premier League era.\nWritten by Paul\nDiscover more from Daily Man Utd News\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.",
