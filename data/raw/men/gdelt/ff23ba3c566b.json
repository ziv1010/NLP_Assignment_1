Apparently, you don't win trophies with kids, I didn't know that.\n\"It is easily the most special trophy I've ever won. It's absolutely exceptional. I wish I could feel pride more often, tonight that's the overwhelming feeling - nothing to do with maybe my last game at Wembley. It was how everyone contributed.\n\"Seeing the faces of these kids. Nobody will ever forget this story - it's so difficult. This tonight, if you find the same story with academy players coming on against a top side and still winning it, wow.\"\nWhile the victory did add another trophy to Klopp's outstanding Liverpool legacy, the German insisted he is beyond caring about his personal CV and insisted his focus is solely on creating happiness for the people of Liverpool.\n\"I couldn't care less about my legacy, I'm not here to create one,\" he stressed. \"I'm here to do the job. We've learned so much in this time. From time to time you need something to really celebrate, this was so special.\n\"We had problems before before the game, injuries, we had a referee who wasn't up to the level of the game - no common sense again. You see tired players. I have no clue who can play on Wednesday [against Southampton in the FA Cup].\n\"We finished the game with players who have [injury] problems. But for tonight, it is a night I will never forget. If no one else sees it like that, no problem, but for me it's a really special memory.\"",
