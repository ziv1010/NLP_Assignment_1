Scott McTominay, a player who everyone is wondering why he can’t get a game for Manchester United at the moment because of his ability. John McGinn, who has been sensational since moving to England and Billy Gilmour who plays for one of the most exciting teams in the Premier League in Brighton.\n‘Steve Clarke has been very clever with what he’s done. He’s found a system that enables him to play all of his best players and has picked a shape that suits them.\n‘The good thing about this team is that they are all starting to mature at the same time – this isn’t a team of youngsters – this is a team of players who are mainly between the age of twenty-five and thirty and coming into their prime. They know the game. They have the energy and vibrancy.\n‘The way that Scotland played has evolved since the last time the two sides met. The system has changed, and the Scottish FA deserve credit because they’ve allowed Steve to get on with his job. That has really helped the development of his team.
