Chelsea will be in the Conference League.\nHow do the coefficient places work?\nGermany and Italy are the nations to have secured a fifth automatic spot in this season’s tournament.\nThe coefficient places, otherwise known as ‘European Performance Spots’, go to the associations who have the best collective performance by their clubs in the previous season.\nItaly will have five representatives in Europe’s premier competition after Atalanta won the Europa League.\nThe winners of both tournaments qualify automatically for the following season’s Champions League.\nWhat are the rules on squads for Uefa competitions?\nAfter the summer transfer window closes, each club competing in any Uefa competition must submit two lists of players.\nOn ‘List A’, clubs can submit a maximum of 25 players, with eight places reserved exclusively for “locally trained players”, also known as homegrown players.\nThese eight must be made up of at least four “club-trained” players and a maximum of four “association-trained” players.\nAccording to Uefa regulations, players who meet the “club trained” criteria have to have been on the club’s books, irrespective of the player’s nationality and age, for at least three years between the ages of 15 and 21.\nAn “association-trained” player is someone that has played in the same country as the club they are currently at for three years, irrespective of the player’s nationality, between the ages of 15 to 21.\nOn ‘List B’, a club can register an unlimited number of players for the 2024-25 season as long as they are born on or after 1 January 2003.\nWho has qualified for Champions League group stages?\nEngland: Man City, Arsenal, Liverpool, Aston Villa\nSpain: Real Madrid, Barcelona, Girona, Atletico Madrid\nItaly: Inter Milan, AC Milan, Juventus, Atalanta, Bologna\nGermany: Bayer Leverkusen, Stuttgart, Bayern Munich, RB Leipzig, Borussia Dortmund\nFrance: Paris St-Germain, Monaco, Brest\nNetherlands: PSV Eindhoven, Feyenoord\nPortugal: Sporting Lisbon, Benfica\nBelgium: Club Bruges\nScotland: Celtic\nAustria: Sturm Graz\nUkraine: Shakhtar Donetsk\nThe final seven slots will be determined via qualifying.\nHow has the Champions League format changed over the years?\nEurope’s most notable football competition began during the 1955-56 season as only a six-team invitational tournament, initially known as the European Champion Clubs’ Cup.\nFrom 1967, the competition grew to 32 teams, was called the European Cup and featured four two-legged rounds prior to a single-match final – this model would last for more than 20 years.\nThe Champions League as we know it began in 1992.\nA group stage was added with the last 16 entering a knockout phase.\nThere was a brief spell with two group stages, but this was reverted back to the single group-stage format for the 2003-04 tournament.\nAre the Europa League and Europa Conference League going to change too?\nYes. Both competitions will see similar changes to those of the Champions League.\nThe Europa League will follow the same format as the Champions League from next season.\nEurope’s third-tier competition, the Europa Conference League, will be rebranded as the Uefa Conference League and teams will play six matches against six different opponents in the league phase.\nBoth the Europa League and Conference League will also feature 36 teams.\nBBC",
