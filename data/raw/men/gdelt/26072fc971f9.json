  "body_text": "Jan Vertonghen has cheekily backed a call for the 2019 Champions League final between Tottenham and Liverpool to be replayed.\nThis follows Jurgen Klopp’s latest outburst on VAR, where he said he believes last Saturday’s match between Spurs and the Reds should be replayed due to a VAR error.\nThe PGMOL admitted a ‘significant error’ was made in disallowing Luis Diaz’s goal during that match, with Liverpool going on to lose 2-1 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nThe refereeing body released audio from the VAR decision on Tuesday evening, with the clip revealing how the blunder occurred – though this did little to appease Klopp.\n‘The audio didn’t change it at all. I was not interested in why it happened because I knew, I saw the outcome, I saw the goal we scored and it didn’t count,’ the Liverpool boss said in a press conference on Wednesday.\n‘But as a football person I think the only outcome should be a replay, that is how it is. It probably won’t happen.\n‘The argument is if we open that gate, it is so unprecedented. I am 56 years old, I am used to wrong decisions, all these kind of things. But something like that never happened.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nAs Klopp correctly points out, replaying the game would open a colossal can of worms, as many other clubs are still aggrieved at contentious refereeing decisions from over the years.\nThis includes some Spurs fans due to the somewhat controversial manner in which they lost the 2019 Champions League final in Madrid.\nLiverpool were awarded a penalty after just 24 seconds when Moussa Sissoko handballed in the box, though some felt it harsh given how close he was to the ball when Sadio Mane fired it in his direction, with the Reds going on to win 2-0.\nReacting to Klopp’s comments, Tottenham fan account The Spurs Web tweeted: ‘If the Liverpool match gets replayed it’ll set a huge precedent. See you in Madrid, Jurgen!’\nVertonghen, who started the final for Spurs, quickly retweeted the post, adding: ‘Count me in!’\nMore Trending\nThe chances of either match getting replayed are of course minimal at best, though the Diaz incident has prompted more discussion of how best to use VAR.\nCentre-back Vertonghen made 315 appearances for Tottenham over an eight-year spell, and the 36-year-oldis now plying his trade in his native Belgium with Anderlecht.\nMORE: Tottenham star ruled out for at least two months with serious knee injury\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
