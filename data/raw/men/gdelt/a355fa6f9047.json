  "body_text": "Six Gunneresses lifted the Euros with England on Sunday.\nFive had already achieved the feat three years ago, winning Euro 2022.\nSandwiched between, those five won the Women’s Champions League 2025 in May with Arsenal.\nWomen’s football in the UK was already on the rise when the Lionesses hosted the European Championships in 2022, but the moment the hosts were victorious in that final, they realised the history they had written went far beyond football.\nThey would be the names credited for inspiring a generation, changing attitudes, creating a legacy.\nThere would be individual perks. Some players are part of brand deals, have social media followings and perform in front of crowds they grew up assuming were exclusive to men.\nThat’s what has been fascinating about following this English squad over the years.\nThey have benefited from the women who came before them, yet still had to battle for the same professional standards afforded to the other sex.\nThat’s why every name that retained the Euros this weekend is unique. The majority will not be remembered for playing before or after female football blew up in Britain, but literally, they are the transition.\nThe pressure of carrying the baton\nThey carry the baton when it’s at its hottest. Where how far they run, and if they handle that baton safely, alters a future.\nBecause let’s be honest, there are those who wanted (and still want) that baton to fall.\nTo handle that pressure and yet have the mentality to be successful is incredible. Forget your own personal pressure that every athlete has. Most only have to worry about the desire to earn a medal. Very few have to do that knowing results impact a movement.\nThink about when the men’s senior team play at a major tournament.\nWhether the Three Lions crash out in the group or fall short in glorious failure, Wembley sells out either way. Companies still want to sponsor merchandise because the brand sells.\nWomen’s football still doesn’t have that luxury.\nWhether it’s the last couple of Euros, the last World Cup, the Champions League or the WSL, the players don’t have the same level of guaranteed support.\nLet’s rewind to Wembley three years ago.\nLet’s say Germany win that final. Or England had been eliminated earlier. Is it an exaggeration to say that could determine how many youngsters carry on watching Sarina Wiegman’s side?\nIs it easier for politicians and governments to feel less obliged to fund grassroots sport for young girls if the images from Euro 2022 and those celebrations don’t exist?\nHow many more might watch a few extra WSL matches after seeing Arsenal win the Champions League?\nEngland lost their opening game in Switzerland.\nDon’t win their second, and that’s the difference between a few more people asking for Russo on the back of their shirt.\nSweden convert one of three spot kicks, and Leah Williamson doesn’t get an increase in brand deals.\nItaly were seconds away from ensuring that Agyemang doesn’t become a household name.\nMeanwhile, how big a celebrity has Chloe Kelly just become?\nShe would have assumed that nothing could beat scoring the winner on home soil to win a trophy for your country.\nYet her story in 2025 will see every TV station, radio show, brand, and sponsor want a piece of the 27-year-old.\nA substitute in every game, the equaliser against Spain was her fourth goal involvement off the bench (I’m counting out the equaliser against the Swedes).\nThat’s before we talk about her being one of the few talents to keep her nerve in a shootout.\nThis from a player who, in January, was so fed up with how she was being treated at Man City she was ready to take a break from the sport because her mental health was being affected.\nA loan back to Arsenal saw her find her smile again, win the Champions League, re-join Arsenal on a permanent deal, get on the plane to Switzerland, and win the Euros… again.\nThe legacy lives on\nFor anyone who’s battled or is battling depression or anxiety, what a story that is.\nThat’s why this instalment of the Euros will be remembered – the stories.\nIt’s almost like every cliché in the sport was demonstrated by the champions.\nSports men and women often stress that the difference between success and failure can be decided by the smallest margins.\nThe Lionesses clearly have unlimited lives.\nIn every knockout round, they conceded first. In each, they were trailing at half time, and somehow have gone all the way despite never leading inside 90 minutes in the quarter-final, semi-final, or final.\nThe most bizarre stat? Winning two shootouts despite failing to convert seven penalties overall.\nLeah Williamson was shell-shocked as the magnitude of the achievement set in.\nThe 28-year-old had just captained her country to successive titles.\nOn and off the pitch, the defender has led a back four that has been unsettled, yet it sums up everything that the best defensive performance was saved for the world champions.\nAt Arsenal since the age of nine, she grew up with training facilities, accommodation, travel, pay, pitch quality, etc., very different to what the idols she looked up to experienced.\nThen it became her responsibility to campaign and fight for those standards to improve.\nWith her girl-next-door looks, she’s always been one of the first Adidas ask to model their kits. Yet she’s relatable, and perhaps her biggest gift is that even though she’s been able to make more money than she imagined doing what she loves (at one point assuming football couldn’t be her full-time job), she’s always stayed true to her roots and never forgotten where she came from.\nThe brand deals will only increase.\nOn behalf of the Just Arsenal family, congratulations to the European Champions, and our Gunners who were at the core of the action.\nYou made your nation proud!\nDan Smith\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nADMIN COMMENT\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans. Everyone is allowed to hold their own opinions even if you disagree with them. It COSTS NOTHING TO BE POLITE TO OTHER ARSENAL FANS.\nCALLING ALL ARSENAL FANS!
