  "body_text": "Michael Owen believes his ‘most underrated teammate’ should be regarded as a Premier League legend but ‘never gets mentioned’.\nOwen played for the likes of Liverpool, Real Madrid and Manchester United during his impressive 17-year professional career.\nThe legendary striker also established himself as one of England’s most prolific goalscorers, netting 40 goals in 89 appearances for the Three Lions.\nReflecting on a career that produced trophies in England and Spain and a host of individual awards – including the Ballon d’Or – Owen identified Liverpool hero Sami Hyypia as his ‘most underrated teammate’.\nHyypia spent a decade at Anfield following his £2.5m move from Dutch side Willem II, making 464 appearances for the Reds.\nRegularly captaining the side, Hyypia helped Liverpool win a cup treble in 2001 and then played a key role in the club’s iconic Champions League win in 2005.\nAsked who he regards as his ‘most underrated’ teammate, Owen told OLBG: ‘Sami Hyypia at Liverpool.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘I just think he was exceptional and when I listen to people talking about all the great defenders of all time in the Premier League he never gets a mention.\n‘He was exceptional, an unbelievable player. Little things that people maybe not pick up on but no he was very, very good and as underrated players go he would be my selection.’\nLiverpool offered Hyypia a coaching role as his playing career was coming to an end and while he rejected the offer in favour of a move to Bayer Leverkusen, he expressed interest in returning to Anfield as a coach at a later date, such was his affection for the club.\nHyypia left the Premier League having twice being named in the PFA Team of the Year, while he was named Finland’s Footballer of the Year a staggering ten times during his entire career.\nFellow Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher, who regularly partnered Hyypia in defence, has previously argued that the Finnish centre-back is the club’s best Premier League signing.\n‘I think sometimes we think of this team now [as the best] – and rightly so, they’ve done a lot more than the teams I played in – but if I think where Liverpool were in 1999, they were a team who were finishing sixth and seventh,” Carragher told Sky Sports in 2021.\n‘They couldn’t come out of the Roy Evans era, they’d gone close to the title and it was fading away; Gerard Houllier comes in and that Liverpool team is known as a weak team, they got bullied.\n‘[Hyypia] came in, he played for the club for 10 years, he was never injured. Liverpool went from becoming a soft touch to a team who were mentally and physically very strong, and he was a massive part of that.\n‘The success we had over the next 10 years with Gerard Houllier and with Rafa Benitez was built on defence.\n‘It wasn’t about being an exciting team going forward, scoring lots of goals. It was built on solidity, and that started with his signing.\n‘The price tag, the never being injured, the 10 years’ service he gave and the trophies he was part of winning.\n‘It was a toss-up between him and Mo Salah, he’s been top scorer, you think of what he’s won, it’s a tough one.\n‘Virgil van Dijk came in and made Liverpool the Champions League [winners] – don’t forget Sami Hyypia won the Champions League.\nIs Sami Hyypia a Premier League great?\n-\nFor sure!\n-\nNot quite...\n‘The only thing that team, or Sami Hyypia, didn’t win was the league. They won FA Cups, League Cups and UEFA Cups as well, and it was a 10-year period.\n‘Sami’s not a better player than Virgil van Dijk, but Virgil van Dijk was a world-record transfer, so you’re expecting that impact.\n‘Sami Hyypia came in and no one had heard of him, no one had seen him play. The impact he had at Liverpool was just instrumental.’\nMeanwhile, Owen has insisted he ‘does not regret’ his controversial move to Manchester United despite the affect it had on his relationship with Liverpool fans.\n‘When you get the opportunity to play for Sir Alex Ferguson and play for a great team, you have to do it,’ he told Midnite. ‘It came with the caveat that everyone is going to hate me.\n‘At the end of the day, you’re a footballer for a short time and you have one career. I wanted to win things, play at the top, with great players, and a great manager. I had to go.\n‘I loved the responsibility of Sir Alex giving me the number 7 shirt. I felt that I was the man to take that pressure.\n‘My role was to bulk up the squad and score a goal when they needed a goal. I could fill in and score important goals, and be experienced and supportive.\nMore Trending\n‘The derby goal in the 4-3 was incredible. Such an adrenaline rush. I knew I had to do something to endear myself to the United fans.\n‘All goals give you a great feeling, but the bigger ones give you a better adrenaline rush. This goal was right up there.\n‘I contributed a lot in that first year, but when I won the league, it was less of a contribution. I look back on it fondly, having some big moments and playing with the biggest legendary manager the Premier League has ever seen.\n‘To still be playing at that elite level when you’re nearing the end of your career, that is what I loved about it.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Gabriel Magalhaes reveals why he mocked Amadou Onana after Arsenal beat Aston Villa\nMORE: ‘Fortunate’ – Ian Wright says Arsenal star ‘got away with one’ after Aston Villa win\nMORE: ‘Terrific’ Premier League star sent transfer message amid Man Utd interest",
