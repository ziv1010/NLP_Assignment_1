  "body_text": "Every trophy Jurgen Klopp won at Liverpool\n- Klopp appointed as Liverpool manager in 2015 before 2024 departure\n- German succeeded Brendan Rodgers in Anfield dugout and delivered first Premier League title in 30 years\n- Champions League success another standout moment of Klopp's tenure\nJurgen Klopp will go down in history as one of Liverpool's greatest ever managers, of that there is no doubt.\nDomestic, European and world competitions have all been won by the Reds under the management of Klopp, who succeeded Brendan Rodgers in October 2015 after spending four months out of work following a hugely successful stint as Borussia Dortmund manager.\nThe German boss called time on his spell on Merseyside in 2024, having lifted the club back to its glorious heights during his reign.\nHere's every piece of silverware won by Klopp at Liverpool.\n1. UEFA Champions League (2018/19)\nThe first trophy Jurgen Klopp lifted at Liverpool was a fairly big one, both in reputation and sheer scale of trophy.\nThe Reds came close to winning the Champions League in 2018 - losing to Real Madrid in the final - but they were able to get their hands on European football's biggest prize one year later as goals from Mohamed Salah and Divock Origi saw off Tottenham Hotspur in the final in Madrid.\n2. UEFA Super Cup (2019)\nKlopp's Liverpool firmly cemented their place as the best team in Europe a few months after winning the Champions League, besting Europa League winners Chelsea in the Super Cup.\nAfter both sides played out a dramatic 2-2 draw, the Reds would score all five of their penalty kicks to win yet another European trophy.\n3. FIFA Club World Cup (2019)\nAfter conquering Europe, Liverpool would go on to conquer the rest of the world by the end of 2019.\nA fiercely contested Club World Cup final meeting with Flamengo was eventually won by an extra time goal from Roberto Firmino.\n4. Premier League (2019/20)\n30 years of hurt was finally ended by Jurgen Klopp's all-conquering Liverpool during the pandemic-hit 2019/20 Premier League season.\nThe Reds romped to the title, finishing 18 points clear of Manchester City and accumulating an astonishing 99 points from 38 league games.\n5. Carabao Cup (2021/22)\nThe 'Caoimhin Kelleher final'.\nThe young Irish goalkeeper was in inspired form in the 2022 Carabao Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley Stadium, scoring a penalty kick in a shootout to win the trophy for the Reds.\n6. FA Cup (2021/22)\nOne of the many, many things that made Klopp's Liverpool team so special was their ability to dig in and win when the pressure was really on.\nPerhaps the best example of this was the 2021/22 FA Cup final, when Liverpool were able to best Chelsea in a penalty shootout after a gruelling clash at Wembley Stadium.\n7. Community Shield (2022)\nKlopp guided Liverpool to the Community Shield ahead of his penultimate Premier League campaign at the helm.\nFacing off against 2021/22 Premier League champions Man City, Liverpool put in an electric performance inspired by new signing Darwin Nunez to win 3-1 at the King Power Stadium.\n8. Carabao Cup (2023/24)\nLiverpool finished a breathless Carabao Cup final against Chelsea with half their outfield players aged 21 or under. However, it was the relative veteran Virgil van Dijk who delivered the knockout blow, thumping in a towering head from a corner deep into extra-time.\nKlopp had announced his departure from Liverpool in the previous month and his fiercely loyal set of players ensured that he would depart as a champion. After the medal ceremony, the entire coaching and playing staff lined up in front of the travelling Liverpool support for an emotional rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone'.",
