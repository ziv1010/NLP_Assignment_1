  "body_text": "Joe Cole has picked out Moises Caicedo as ‘the best midfielder in the world between the boxes’ and claims he wouldn’t swap the Chelsea star for anybody else in the game.\nChelsea spent a then British-record fee of £115million to sign Caicedo back in 2023, with the Ecuador international having earned rave reviews for his performances on the south coast with Brighton.\nAnd after a steady start to life in west London, Caicedo has firmly established himself among the most highly regarded central midfielders in English football.\nCaicedo has started all but one of Chelsea’s opening eight matches of the Premier League season – only missing out against Nottingham Forest after he was only deemed fit enough for the bench.\nHowever, Caicedo was introduced as Enzo Maresca rang the changes at half-time and the 23-year-old was instrumental as the Blues won 3-0 thanks to a second-half demolition job at the City Ground.\nThe former Brighton man will be expected to return to Chelsea’s starting XI this evening when the Club World Cup winners resume their Champions League campaign at home to Ajax.\n‘He’s the best midfielder in the world between the boxes, and he’s improving at both ends of the pitch as well. I think he’s absolutely brilliant,’ ex-Chelsea winger Cole told Paddy Power when asked about Caicedo.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘In terms of breaking up play, playing it through the lines, being intelligent, driving the team forward, and he’s also adding goals to his game, and he scores great goals.\n‘I’m struggling to think of somebody I’d want in my midfield better than him at the moment, I really would. And that’s a massive shout.\n‘But I wouldn’t swap him for anyone now at Chelsea.’\nChelsea’s talisman last season, Cole Palmer, has had a deeply frustrating start to the campaign and widespread reports suggest he could be sidelined until the end of November due to a persistent groin problem.\nBut according to Cole, Chelsea’s greater strength in depth means the club should be ‘fine’ without the England attacker for the time being.\n‘If Cole Palmer would have been injured 18 months ago, the whole of the Kings Road would have been crying tears because he was that influential,’ the three-time Premier League winner said.\n‘I’ve never seen a player for many years be that influential on a Chelsea team since probably [Gianfranco] Zola.\n‘Cole Palmer was so influential, but then the team’s been built around him nicely, so I think Chelsea will be fine.’\nCole believes the fierce level of competition in the Premier League makes winning the Champions League a more realistic ambition for Chelsea this season.\nMore Trending\n‘They’re more likely to win the Champions League. As mad as it sounds, I think it’s slightly easier to win the Champions League,’ he continued.\n‘You can have a run at it, you can get lucky in three or four games. You still have to be a top side, I don’t want to discredit any team that’s won it, but to win a Premier League title [is different].\n‘There’s so much competition [in the Premier League] this year. Manchester City, Arsenal, Liverpool – it is going be brilliant.\n‘For Chelsea, I’m not saying for everybody, but Chelsea this year would be more difficult with the consistency [needed] to win the league, but they can beat anyone on their day.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Sean Dyche faces tough start at Nottingham Forest against formidable Porto\nMORE: Antonio Conte admits Napoli ‘mistake’ after Rasmus Hojlund and Kevin de Bruyne transfers\nMORE: Man Utd decide punishment for fan who attacked the supporter refusing to cut their hair",
