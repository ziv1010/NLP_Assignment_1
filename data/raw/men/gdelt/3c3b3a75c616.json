  "body_text": "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have reportedly asked new technical director Jason Wilcox to undertake a thorough audit of the job done by Erik ten Hag this season as the top brass contemplate whether or not to part ways with the Dutch coach.\nTen Hag’s job is far from secure after a very underwhelming and disappointing campaign that currently has United in seventh position in the Premier League after 12 top-flight defeats.\nThe Red Devils are almost certainly set to miss out on Champions League football and are facing an uphill battle to qualify for the Europa League, with their rivals rapidly closing in.\nTen Hag’s claim to remain in the Old Trafford dugout was dealt another significant blow last weekend as his side narrowly won on penalties to edge out Championship outfit Coventry City in the semi-final of the FA Cup.\nUnited had a commanding 3-0 lead with 20 minutes of regular time left on the clock but when Coventry scored their first of the game, the players completely crumbled. They surrendered their lead as Coventry forced the match to head into extra time.\nMark Robins’ side thought they had won it at the death but their winning goal was ruled out by VAR because Haji Wright, who supplied the cross, was deemed to have been offside. Luckily, United showed some stronger mental fortitude in the ensuing penalty shootout to sail through to the final, where they will face Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City.\nThe performance and manner of capitulation left a lot to be desired. Ten Hag himself admitted that the 20-time English champions got away with it despite his insistence that the win was not embarrassing.\nRatcliffe and Wilcox – whose appointment was officially confirmed by United on Friday – were at Wembley to watch the game.\nThe Telegraph reports that Ratcliffe has instructed Wilcox to immediately kickstart a review of Ten Hag before INEOS make a decision on whether to keep him or sack him at the end of the campaign.\nThe newspaper relays, “Erik ten Hag will effectively be on trial over the next month as Manchester United’s new technical director Jason Wilcox conducts an audit of the manager’s credentials and dressing room relations before the club makes a final decision on the Dutchman’s future.”\n“Telegraph Sport understands United have tasked Wilcox with providing a detailed assessment of Ten Hag’s strengths and weaknesses and relationship with the squad to better determine whether his approach can fit with the overarching style of play and philosophy they intend to pursue – or if a change of manager is necessary.”\n“Sunday’s implosion in front of United’s new kingpin Sir Jim Ratcliffe did Ten Hag no favours and there is an acceptance the situation could become unsustainable should United miss out on Europe entirely. But the starting point has been a desire to explore whether the manager can realistically operate within the so-called “game model” Wilcox and impending sporting director Dan Ashworth seek to implement.”\nJames Ducker further notes, “Wilcox – who was formally appointed as the club’s new technical director on Friday and at Wembley to watch United narrowly survive a huge scare to set up a rematch of last year’s Cup final with Manchester City – is expected to closely appraise Ten Hag’s training sessions over the coming weeks. He will also hold extensive talks with the manager, staff and players during his analysis.”\nIt’s understood that Wilcox’s remit will also be extended to include whether or not Ten Hag has fostered cordial relations with his players amidst suggestions of a falling out with Jadon Sancho and fractures in his association with Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.\nWilcox has also been tasked with determining whether United’s poor performances this term have been driven by the injury crisis that has plagued the team or whether there are deeper concerns such as players ignoring the coaching staff’s instructions and whether Ten Hag is not flexible enough to adapt to constantly changing circumstances.\nIf Ten Hag is found culpable, United will then decide whether Ten Hag would be open to a different approach. If not, the 54-year-old coach will be cut loose.\nThe Telegraph note, “The Old Trafford hierarchy recognise a decision on Ten Hag’s future must be made by the end of the season so Wilcox does not have long to provide his review. United’s final Premier League game is away to Brighton on May 19, with the Cup final against City due to take place at Wembley six days later.”\nIt’s believed that there is some reluctance to relieve Ten Hag of his duties because of the unavailability of credible or viable options to replace him.\nHowever, INEOS are of the opinion that there are “some very interesting and talented young coaches working in Europe” including Bologna’s Thiago Motta, Girona’s Michel, Brighton’s Roberto De Zerbi and Ruben Amorim of Sporting Lisbon. There is an acceptance that whatever appointment is made would carry a degree of risk.\nIf a managerial change is made, INEOS are eager to ensure the new head coach has the “character, personality and temperament” to succeed at a club the size and stature of United.\nIt’s also important that the new boss works within the right environment and under conducive conditions.\nWant to be the first to hear breaking Man United news?
