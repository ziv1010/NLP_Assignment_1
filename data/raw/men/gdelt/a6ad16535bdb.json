Who knows how it's going to end up?\"\nThe Spaniard, who has been in charge of Arsenal for four years, said the Premier League was a \"beautiful\" competition.\n\"We are so privileged to have the league that we have, to have the competition that we have, to have the uncertainty that we have every single game,\" he said.\n\"That's what drives this league and a lot of football supporters to watch it every time because it's beautiful.\"\n© 2023 AFP",
