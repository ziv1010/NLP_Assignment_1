  "body_text": "The man who kept a £1m Lowry under his bed\n'Even though I knew nothing about art at the time I built up an international business'\nBill Clark has sold 9,500 paintings in 25 years. But his legacy is not merely that of a charming, knowledgeable, passionate dealer with a flair for marketing. He has championed Northern artists and made demand for their work international.\nAnd it all came from creating a device to attach to buildings to deter birds from defacing and damaging them. His invention, thought up at a table in his then little flat in Lymm, was the catalyst for a very successful business.\nWhen he sold the company he gained the financial freedom to acquire something he had always wanted - a LS Lowry painting. He bought The Cricket Match - featuring a game on a green next to a mill. He touted it to professional cricketers who he thought might be interested but had no takers.\nREAD MORE: 'Our town centre is back from the dead - this is what we want from it now'\nThen, in a typically inspired move, he remembered John Paul Getty Junior loved the game. He bought the painting from Bill for £400,000. \"I realised at that point this could be quite a good path towards my retirement,\" Bill said. \"Even though I knew nothing about art at the time I built up an international business. I learned using the internet and marketing.\"\nAs he closes the door on his gallery in Hale today (Saturday Oct 5th) he can look back on the fact that he has put a string of artists into the spotlight and changed their lives forever - as well as feeding the souls of thousands whose lives have been enriched by art.\nAlong the way he survived a raid on his gallery in Ashley Road by professional art thieves. The £lm haul, which included a £400,00 Lowry work, was taken in a smash and grab burglary. Thirteen paintings were stolen. \"It was just a few weeks after we had opened the gallery and could have finished me. But we got through,\" Bill recalls.\nThe insurance paid out - but not to what was felt to be the true value of the works. But Bill astutely turned a negative into a positive. The raid made national and regional headlines and raised his profile. But, almost two decades on, none of the works taken has been recovered.\nBill believes they are probably being passed from one criminal gang to another as ‘collateral’ - possibly as a down payment for drugs.\nAt the time of the theft in September 2006 the haul had a retail value of £500,000. But art prices have rocketed in recent years and the paintings are now thought to be worth more than £1m.\nHe also ended up doing interviews for newspapers in Chile after a more upbeat episode. He organised a huge exhibition of northern art in the chairman's room at Manchester City's Etihad Stadium. The club's manager at the time, Manuel Pellegrini was curious and inquired as to what the display was.\nWhen he left City after winning the League Cup, Premiership, and leading the club to their first ever Champions League semi-final, the club gave him a leaving present. It was a £100,000 Lowry. \"It was a painting of a single figure. The newspapers in Chile wanted to speak to me to understand the significance of Lowry,\" said Bill.\nBill said: \"I started by buying Lowrys and then, through reading Peter Davidson's book (A Northern School) on art, I acquired works by Theodore Major, William Turner, Alan Lowndes, and Harold Riley.\n\"Then John Thompson contacted me and said: \"Do you want to sell my paintings?' I said to him that he needed to raise his profile. I wrote a book about him and we launched it in Manchester. Granada TV picked up on it and Channel 4 did a feature and off he went.\n\"We were inundated with requests for his work. It is because of John Thompson that I had the gallery. I had been working from home but when the Channel 4 feature hit I had hundreds of people wanting his paintings.\n\"Up until he died in 2011 we sold 2,500 of his works. It changed his life completely. He went from living in a council house in Oldham to a beautiful bungalow in Greenfield with a BMW M class and he was buying his caps from Burlington Arcade in Mayfair. He came on the opening night of his exhibition we staged wearing Gucci loafers.\n\"He really enjoyed the money and went on a trip on the QE2. Part of the joy of what I have done is that I have been able to develop artists like him. I have met all the people that knew Lowry, who are all dead now. I've absorbed all the knowledge from them.\"\nHis customers have included TV personalities and 'the more discerning football stars'. \"They want to know that work is not going to be worth less in the future. I tell people buying art is a bit like buying stocks and shares. An artist that was huge in the 1980s - like the Victorian watercolourists - you can't give away now. One thing about Lowry is that his work is a constant - there will always be buyers for Lowry.\n\"Lowry is an iconic 20th century artist. For northern buyers it is aspirational to own one - for southern buyers it is more of an investment. Good Lowrys still attract headline prices. He was not massively prolific, doing just 2000 to 2,500 oils.\"\nIf he was confined to a desert island, Bill has no hesitation in the three paintings he would want to take. The first is called The Procession by Lowry.\n\"I bought it in the early 2000s and it is a classic Lowry. It has a great perspective - a street of terraced houses, an industrial scene in the background and a procession of people going down it. I was very lucky to be able to buy it and later it became a milestone for me - it was the first million pound Lowry that I sold. I sold it for £1.25m. I was living in a flat at the time and kept it under my bed.\n\"I came from a very poor background - who would have thought that a lad from Cockermouth, Cumbria, raised in a two-up two-down tiny terraced house with an outside toilet would end up owning a £1m Lowry and selling it.\"\nBill's father was a door- to-door salesman and his mother worked in shops and was a cleaner. \"I think I picked up my work ethic from my parents. When I was young my mum would take me with her round all the cleaning jobs. It was drilled into me that you have to work to achieve things,\" he says.\nHis second choice of most treasured picture is, understandably, The Cricket Match by Lowry. \"It was the first Lowry I bought, and I had goosebumps when I bought it - spine tingling. It was like owning a piece of history.\"\nBut his third choice is the most poignant. By Theodore Major, the late Wigan artist, it is called 'Man and Sun' and is 4ft by 5ft. Bill said: \"He was a cantankerous old man who lived in a house in Wigan. You never see a picture of him smiling. He was hailed as one of the greatest artists of his generation. His pictures are painted with passion - very gritty.\n\"But as well as dark and industrial works he painted beautiful flower pictures, and religious pictures - his range was much wider than Lowry. If Major had sold to galleries he would have been an international artist. But he would tell dealers to get out of his house. He would say 'I don't want my pictures hanging in posh people's houses'. When he died there were 2000 pictures in his house.\"\nSpeaking of 'Man and Sun' he added: \"It is very grey, ethereal, with a single man with a white border around it, and that represents the working class. There is also an industrial landscape. So you see the drabness of the industrial area and the brightness and hope of the sun. It is visually stunning and one that always resonated with me.\"\nWhen he staged an exhibition of Major's work at his gallery it was packed. \"We couldn't get everyone it at one point. It was emotional too. There were people from Wigan with tears in their eyes as they looked at the paintings.\"\nThe painting's themes of dark and light were even more relevant to Bill in recent times. \"For the last two years I have been recovering from bowel cancer and I have had a pretty rough time with it. I have had multiple surgeries, chemotherapy, and other treatment. I have lots of bad times.\n\"When something like that happens it makes you reappraise what is important in your life. I have loved working in art for 25 years and dealing with people. But I am close to 70 and I think the time's right to pack up. I have a little grandson who I have a very close bond with and I want to spend as much time as I can with him.\"\nHe will not be walking away entirely from the art world. \"I will still work when required for the auction houses when they need a Lowry to be authenticated. I had to tell one person that the £30,000 Lowry they had bought was not a Lowry - but I managed to get her money back for her.\"\nBill has played an integral part helping ignite the careers of the new generation of northern artists by selling their work and applying his marketing genius. They include Liam Spencer, Stephen Campbell, Reg Gardner, and Ben Kelly. \"Liam Spencer was the first one of that generation - he set the trail. But there will never be another Lowry,\" Bill says.\nHis gallery has been an integral part of the fabric of Hale town centre since 2006. Its name is embossed on the sign of the railway station 20 yards away. There are artists across our region who he has helped lift to new heights, and, by focusing solely on Northern art, he has made it much sought-after.\nAnd Bill's tip for a rising star? \"Lucy Manfredi. Of all the artists I have represented she's had the quickest uptake. She has been selling through various galleries but I took her on a year ago and we have sold a huge number of her pictures to people locally, in London, and America.\"",
