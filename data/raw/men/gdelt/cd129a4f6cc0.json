The fan went straight to Felix, hugged the Portugal forward, and then pulled out his phone for a selfie, which the star obliged.“FC Goa failed to fulfil its obligation to: (i) comply with and implement existing safety rules and take every safety precaution demanded by circumstances after the match; and (ii) ensure that law and order was maintained in the stadium and its immediate surroundings, as one spectator invaded the areas surrounding the field of play during the match,” the disciplinary and ethics committee said after its meeting last week.Goa were found to be in violation of Article 64.1 of the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Code and were ordered to settle the fine within 30 days.Interestingly, Al-Nassr were also handed a fine of $10,000 for violating Article 22.2 of the AFC Champions League Two 2025/26 competition regulations for their clash against Goa at Fatorda. According to the disciplinary panel, “several individuals affiliated with Al-Nassr entered the Controlled Access Area without being in physical possession of the necessary accreditation.”\nEnd of Article\nFollow Us On Social Media",
