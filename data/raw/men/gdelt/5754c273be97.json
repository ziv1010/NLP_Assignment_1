  "body_text": "It’s a quiet week, diary-wise, as we get towards the end of summer, but we’ll be keeping an eye out next week for fallout from Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin’s meeting in Alaska today. That could mean further calls like the series we saw on Wednesday, or even preparations for a second summit involving both Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which Trump said he wanted to happen ‘almost immediately’ if things go well in Anchorage. It could also mean European leaders in crisis mode if the summit goes badly or Trump and Putin float terms that are unacceptable to Ukraine.\nLeading the week\nMonday (August 18): Former US Attorney General Bill Barr questioned in first deposition as part of Congressional investigation into Jeffrey Epstein; California legislature begins work on redistricting bill.\nTuesday (August 19): Edinburgh International Television Festival opens; Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz compete at US Open mixed doubles tournament; Professional Football Association awards.\nWednesday (August 20): UK inflation data; Kneecap member Liam O’Hanna in court on terror charges.\nThursday (August 21): GCSE results; Quarterly immigration statistics; Reading & Leeds Festival begins.\nFriday (August 22): England face USA in the opening match of the Women’s Rugby World Cup; US Fed chair Jerome Powell speaks at Jackson Hole economic symposium.\nSaturday (August 23): Notting Hill Carnival.\nSunday (August 24): US Open gets underway; Volodymyr Zelenskyy address to mark Ukraine Independence Day.\nAlso look out for…\nAugust 18\nCourt hearing for men charged with violent disorder at Epping protest\nJury selection begins in class action privacy case against Google\nChinese Foreign Minister expected to visit India\nMen’s and women’s finals at the Cincinnati Open\nAugust 19\nTrial begins for ‘Ketamine Queen’ charged over Matthew Perry’s death\nHearings continue in Glasgow’s Queen Elizabeth University Hospital inquiry\nUEFA Champions League qualifying play offs\nLondon Zoo and Whipsnade Zoo annual weigh-ins\nAugust 20\nDeadline for China’s response to Angela Rayner’s letter on embassy plans\nMade by Google launch event\nOlympic champion Keeley Hodgkinson makes return from injury at Lausanne Diamond League\nAugust 21\nPublic sector finance statistics\nUS ‘hitwoman’ sentenced over Birmingham murder plot\nParole board hearings for Erik and Lyle Menendez\nWorld’s oldest person turns 116\nAugust 22\nRetail sales figures\nBallot closes for Scottish Green Party co-leadership contest\nVerdict due in Thaksin Shinawatara lese-majeste trial\nColdplay begins 10-night run at Wembley\nAugust 23\nSouth Korean president Lee Jae Myung visits Japan to meet PM Shigeru Ishiba\nTaiwan referendum on nuclear restart\nVuleta a Espana begins\nAugust 24\nLee Jae Myung begins visit to the US\nNotting Hill Carnival Family Day\nKey statistics, reports and results\nAugust 18\nRightmove house price index\nAugust 19\nONS release on perceptions of the criminal justice system\nRegister of political donations\nCanada inflation\nFed interest rate decision minutes\nResults from: Home Depot, BHP Group, Medtronic\nAugust 20\nProducer price inflation\nPrivate rent and house price statistics\nEU inflation\nChina loan prime rate announcement\nResults from: Lowe’s Companies, Target, TJX\nAugust 21\nQuarterly knife crime statistics\nHMRC tax receipts and National Insurance contributions\nFlash UK PMI\nTrain Operating Company key stats\nResults from: Walmart, Hays\nAugust 22\nHMICFRS report on Northamptonshire child protection\nQuarterly stats on NHS bed occupancy and availability\nUK retail sales\nFitch sovereign review of the UK\nGfK UK Consumer Confidence Barometer Results from: BJ’s Wholesale Club\nThe news diary is provided in association with Foresight News.\nEmail pged@pressgazette.co.uk to point out mistakes, provide story tips or send in a letter for publication on our \"Letters Page\" blog",
