  "body_text": "Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti spoke to Radio Anch’io Sport about all things football. He spoke about Nico Paz, Milan, Roma, etc. Speaking about the latter, Ancelotti said: “I’m very happy here. Rainieri [who said he wanted Ancelotti to be the Giallorossi coach next season] is a friend and he’s doing very well at Roma. I’m very close to Roma. He’ll always be in my memory. But I’m very happy here. In Madrid, when you win a title, you’re already thinking about the next one. Now we’re thinking about the Super Cup. The circle at Real Madrid never closes. This certainly motivates me.”\nAncelotti: “At Real Madrid, when you win a title, you’re already thinking about the next one”\nAncelotti spoke to Radio Anch’io Sport\nAncelotti on Nico Paz\n“We follow him closely. I think this year of training away from Real Madrid will be very good for him. He is a player who we think will be the future of Real Madrid.”\nAncelotti on the importance of Spanish players at Madrid\n“It is true that Real Madrid’s squad is full of foreigners and that many young players have arrived in recent years. The latest cases, Guler and Endrick, are slowly entering the team. But the Spanish group is always very important because it determines the atmosphere in the dressing room. Real Madrid’s fortune in this last year has had to do with the fact that the Spanish group has been very serious, professional and very powerful.”\nAncelotti on whether Real Madrid will be his last team\n“I like to train every day. So the issue of the national team is complicated. Who knows if Real Madrid will be my last team? I have a contract for two years, but the contract can be broken or extended.”\nAncelotti on football these days\n“Football is changing and will continue to change a lot. Technology has improved refereeing; respect between referees and players has grown. It is changing for the better. What is striking right now is the number of matches. The calendar is exaggerated and very demanding for the players. It must change next year because it cannot move forward like this. It puts the health of the players at risk.”\nAncelotti on Champions League qualification\n“The main objective now is to qualify before thinking about a final. The Champions League road is not easy, we still have two games to go to advance to the next round. At European level, the only team that stands out is Liverpool, who have won everything in the Champions League and are playing very well. It is in March or April when you have to be ready to go for victory.\n“With this new format, what is clear is that there are many surprises and uncertainties. But in the end, I think there is time to catch up.”\nAncelotti on his relationship with the team\n“The relationship with the players is key, as is the one with the club. The group, the team, is the lifeline for the coach, who must be cordial, but professional in his roles. A good relationship is not only achieved by putting the players on the field, because you only put 11 out in each game, and the rest go to the bench. The seriousness must come from the coach and the player.”\nAncelotti on Milan and Fonseca\n“Sacking a coach is part of his job. I have been fired many times, because when there are problems in a team, the responsibility falls on only one man, who is the coach. It is inevitable that when things do not go well, the responsibility falls on the coach, even if it is not fair. Fonseca knows as well as I do that this can happen.”\n“In football, you never know. They played very well against us and deserved to win. Maybe he hasn’t found the continuity that the Rossoneri were asking for. It’s quite simple.”\nAncelotti on whether there should be 10 substitutions in the future\n“No, that’s exaggerated [laughs]. It’s enough to play fewer games. La Liga, UEFA and FIFA must come to an agreement. Will they find one? I don’t know. The key is there. We started training today, the 30th, and on January 29, a month later, we played nine games. To me, that seems exaggerated. That said, congratulations to everyone and I wish you a peaceful 2025.”",
