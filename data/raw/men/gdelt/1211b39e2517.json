  "body_text": "Ghanaian forward Hafiz Wontah Konkoni has completed a move to Ethiopian Coffee SC, signing a two-year contract after departing from Tanzanian giants Young Africans SC.\nKonkoni’s stint at Yanga was marred by injuries, which limited his appearances and overall impact on the team.Despite these challenges, he managed to score twice in five appearances, one goal in the Tanzanian league on his debut and another in the CAF Champions League. Konkoni spent the previous season on loan at Libyan club Olympic Azzaweya.\nOriginally joining Yanga from Bechem United, the forward struggled to secure a permanent spot due to his injury setbacks.\nEthiopian Coffee hopes that Konkoni’s arrival will bolster their attacking lineup, providing a much-needed boost as they aim to strengthen their offensive capabilities for the ongoing season.\nThis move marks a fresh start for Konkoni as he seeks to rediscover his form and make a significant impact in Ethiopian football. Konkoni is the second Ghanaian to move to Ethiopian Coffee this transfer window after former Asante Kotoko goalkeeper Danlad Ibrahim.",
