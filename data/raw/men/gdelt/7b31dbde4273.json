Some sides will welcome the pause in domestic fixtures as a time to reset, recuperate and get ready to go again for the run-in, while others will be cursing the interruption which can halt their momentum.\nDespite clocking up back-to-back wins in their last two fixtures, Manchester United are likely to find themselves in the former camp, as injuries and a threadbare squad have made manager Ruben Amorim’s life difficult in recent weeks.\nManchester United talk 'forbidden'\nThe Red Devils’ 3-0 win at Leicester on Sunday was not enough to see them move past 13th place in the Premier League table, with the club needing a dramatic improvement in their final nine games if they are to avoid achieving their worst-ever finish of the Premier League era - a mark set last year when they limped to an eighth-placed finish.\nAfter crashing out of the FA Cup at the hands of Fulham earlier this month, the club’s only hope of silverware is now the Europa League, after their 5-2 aggregate win over Real Sociedad saw them book a quarter-final tie against Lyon.\nThe French side dispatched Romainian team FCSB 7-1 over two legs in the last-16 to set up next month’s quarter-final, which will see Lyon host the first leg on April 10, before the return clash at Old Trafford a week later.\nWhile Lyon are currently 23 points behind Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain, they are in the mix for a Champions League spot, meaning boss Paulo Fonseca - who was ranked at No. 46 in FourFourTwo's list of the 50 best managers in the world last year - is conscious that he does not want his team to be distracted by the opportunity to advance to a European semi-final.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\n\"It's forbidden to talk about Manchester at the moment\" Fonseca - who was slapped with a nine-month matchday duties ban earlier this month - said at a press conference on Saturday, as per LyonFoot. “We only talk about Le Havre. We still have many important matches before the European Cup. We still have time to prepare and think about Manchester.\"\nLyon were able to ease past relegation-threatened Le Harve 4-2 to go into the international break on a high, but return from the break with a trip to Strasbourg, before hosting Lille - the two teams immediately below them in the table.\nNext month’s quarter-final pits two teams in contrasting fortunes together. The Europa League is Manchester United’s only chance of glory this term and will be the difference between playing European football or not next term - something which will play a huge part in their summer recruitment drive.\nFor Lyon, the tie gives them the opportunity to match their best-ever run in a major European tournament, with the club never having made it past the last four in either the Champions League or Europa League, but the club are very much in the hunt to be the best of the rest behind PSG in the Ligue 1 table at the end of the season.\nFor more than a decade, Joe Mewis has worked in football journalism as a reporter and editor. Mewis has had stints at Mirror Football and LeedsLive among others and worked at FourFourTwo throughout Euro 2024, reporting on the tournament. In addition to his journalist work, Mewis is also the author of four football history books that include times on Leeds United and the England national team. Now working as a digital marketing coordinator at Harrogate Town, too, Mewis counts some of his best career moments as being in the iconic Spygate press conference under Marcelo Bielsa and seeing his beloved Leeds lift the Championship trophy during lockdown.",
