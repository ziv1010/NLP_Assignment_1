This year though, has there started to be a powershift in Spanish football?\nWell, nine matches into this La Liga season, it is Real Madrid who lead the way at the top. Xabi Alonso has won eight of nine league matches since arriving as manager in the summer, most-recently seeing his side battle to a 1-0 victory over nine-man Getafe at the Coliseum last Sunday night. Kylian Mbappé, who else, the match-winner. However, one could argue los Blancos failed their only serious test so far, demolished 5-2 by Atlético Madrid in September's derby at the Metropolitano, a hammering that was even more emphatic than that scoreline may suggest.\nOn the flip side, on Wednesday, los Merengues did make it three wins out of three in the Champions League. Following victories over Marseille and Kairat, Real Madrid, just about, overcame Juventus 1-0 at the Bernabéu this week; Vinícius Júnior's attempt thwacking the post, with Jude Bellingham on hand to turn home the rebound. Now though, this is the biggest game of the season, or any season for that matter, so can los Blancos propel themsleves five points clear at the top with a win?\nMeantime, champions Barcelona have wobbled in recent weeks. Before the international break, Hansi Flick's side were hammered 4-1 by Sevilla, conceding twice late on at the Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán, after Robert Lewandowski had squandered an opportunity to equalise from the penalty spot. Then, last Saturday, Barça appeared set to drop yet more points when struggling Girona visited Montjuïc, the score 1-1 going into injury time, only for Ronald Araújo to snatch victory at the death. This leaves them two points behind the leaders, having drawn with Rayo Vallecano at Vallecas back in August.\nBarcelona are also not flawless in the Champions League, defeated 2-1 when holders Paris Saint-Germain came to Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys earlier this month. Nevertheless, Flick's side very much got back on track on Tuesday, annihilating ten-man Olympiacos 6-1 in Catalonia; Fermín López the hat-trick hero, Lamine Yamal converting a penalty and Marcus Rashford striking twice.\nAs already outlined, Clásico victories, and high-scoring ones at that, were integral to Barcelona's treble triumph last season, but they may travel to the Spanish capital as underdogs this time round. Goals should be guaranteed at the Bernabéu come Sunday afternoon, and the world will be watching, as everyone always is when these two juggernauts meet, but who will prevail in el Clásico?\nReal Madrid vs Barcelona head-to-head record\n- Matches Played: 261.\n- Real Madrid Wins: 105. Draws: 52. Barcelona Wins: 104.\nReal Madrid team news\nXabi Alonso is enduring a defensive injury crisis right now, given that Antonio Rüdiger, Dani Carvajal, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dean Huijsen, David Alaba and Ferland Mendy are all sidelined.\nSo, as was the case on Wednesday, Raúl Asencio will continue to partner Éder Militão at the heart of defence, with Fede Valverde, begrudgingly, filling in at right-back.\nFurther forward, Brahim Díaz and Vinícius Júnior came into attack against Juventus, but it would be no surprise if either Franco Mastantuono or Rodrygo or both got the nod this time. Mid-week scorer Jude Bellingham will keep his place in midfield at the expense of Eduardo Camavinga.\nReal Madrid predicted lineup vs Barcelona: (4-3-3): Courtois; Valverde, Asencio, Militão, Carreras; Tchouaméni, Güler, Bellingham; Mastantuono, Mbappé, Vinícius.\nReal Madrid player to watch vs Barcelona\nKylian Mbappé's late winner against Getafe last Sunday takes his tally to 15 goals already this season, thereby averaging one every 70 minutes. To date, the Frenchman has scored 11 goals in eight meetings with Barcelona, including five in his last three Clásico, notably bagging a hat-trick during a 4-3 defeat at Montjuïc in May, so will he be on the winning side in this fixture for the first time?\nBarcelona team news\nHansi Flick meantime is down to his third-choice goalkeeper. Joan García and Marc-André ter Stegen are sidelined so, as he did throughout last season, Wojciech Szczęsny will deputise.\nOut-field too, Barcelona are without Andreas Christensen, Gavi, Dani Olmo, Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski, but Lamine Yamal is back, starting the last two matches following a groin issue.\nIn the absence of Raphinha and Lewandowski, Marcus Rashford, scorer of a brace against Olympiacos, will likely be deployed on the left, with Ferran Torres leading the line. Frenkie de Jong will also return to midfield, having been rested in the Champions League on Tuesday.\nBarcelona predicted lineup vs Real Madrid: (4-3-3): Szczęsny; Koundé, García, Cubarsí, Balde; de Jong, Pedri, Fermín López; Lamine Yamal, Rashford, Torres.\nBarcelona player to watch vs Real Madrid\nLamine Yamal's spot-kick this week was his 28th goal for Barça already, scoring during three of the four Clásicos last season, registering two assists in the other, so will the 18 year old be the difference again?\nReal Madrid vs Barcelona prediction\nAs mentioned, the Clásico guarantees goals, but we can't split these two teams, hence why we're forecasting a draw. One thing is for certain, you don't want to miss this: Real Madrid 2-2 Barcelona.\nReal Madrid vs Barcelona FAQs - La Liga\nHow to watch Real Madrid vs Barcelona in La Liga on TV channel?\nReal Madrid vs Barcelona in La Liga will be available on the following TV channels;\n- UK: Premier Sports 1\n- USA: ESPN2\n- Canada: TSN3\nHow to watch Real Madrid vs Barcelona in La Liga on live streaming?\nReal Madrid vs Barcelona in La Liga will be available on the following streaming services;\n- UK: Premier Sports Player\n- USA: ESPN+\n- Canada: TSN+\nWhat is the date and kick-off time for Real Madrid vs Barcelona in La Liga?\nReal Madrid vs Barcelona takes place on Sunday 26 October 2025, with kick off at 15:15 (GMT), 11:15 (EDT) & 8:15 (PDT).",
