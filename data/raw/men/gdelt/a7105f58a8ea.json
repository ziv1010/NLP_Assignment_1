It’s a crazy world, right? Everything happens all around the world, not just in sport – issues. Nobody is away from that.\n“It’s not about United, of course, because United are beyond that person. They don’t defend what United is.\n“I know it’s happened sometimes in our club but it’s not a problem about a specific club, or specific department in world football. It happens everywhere.\n“If you take a look around you will realise we are not in the right path.”\nCity remain in a tight battle for Champions League qualification places and head into Saturday’s Premier League clash with Crystal Palace at the Etihad Stadium sixth in the table.\nThere has been some good news for all the challengers this week with confirmation that the top five will qualify for Europe’s elite competition, but Guardiola is taking nothing for granted.\nWhilst City remain favourites, the champions have been hampered by injuries to key players all season and Erling Haaland, Rodri, John Stones, Manuel Akanji and Nathan Ake are all still out.\nGuardiola said: “It’s better to have five teams instead of four with the situation we have, but there are seven or eight contenders, so it will be until the last moment.\n“We didn’t have the squad all season but we adapt. You can see it as a problem or a challenge. You could see the position as a disaster but it could be worse.\n“I’m really satisfied for the way we’ve handled it for the situation where we are.\n“Tomorrow is a team who have been in incredible, top form in the last two months and they have always been difficult, Crystal Palace, here.\n“I admire the manager (Oliver Glasner), the way they play, the talent and the physicality they have but, at the same time, I’m optimistic to finish well this season.”",
