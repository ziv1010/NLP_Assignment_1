He might have a way of getting the best out of him. He’s already on the books at the football club, so Hojlund will come into Carrick’s equation in the summer.\n‘I don’t care what’s gone on before, he’s obviously a top footballer, otherwise he wouldn’t have got to Manchester United in the first place.\n‘So I would say bring him back in, let’s give him a chance to see where he’s at and see where his mindset is when he comes back.\n‘We need to find out if he has still got the fire in his belly to play for Manchester United. Does he think he’s good enough himself? Does he want it? You go from there.\n‘Like I’ve said, things change very quickly in football. There’s a different manager in charge now, and there could be another different one in the summer who has a whole new outlook, so why not?’\nCarrick is in interim charge now, but whether he will be manager next season is yet to be seen.\nMore Trending\nThe 44-year-old has started has started his spell in charge perfectly, with wins over Manchester City and Arsenal, but club legends Roy Keane and Gary Neville believe that he should not be given the job permanently, even if he does brilliantly well for the rest of the season.\nWhether Hojlund returns to Old Trafford and competes with Sesko and Mbeumo up front, the next permanent manager would likely have a say in it.\nIt may still be preferable for the Red Devils to cash in on the Denmark international, with Napoli’s obligation to buy him in the summer worth around £38m.\nHojlund himself has also hinted that he fancies staying in Italy, given the choice.\nMORE: Phil Jones identifies the signing Man Utd must make next summer\nMORE: Cole Palmer injury update with Chelsea star’s mystery condition explained\nMORE: Why Keir Starmer gave Xi Jinping a football from an Arsenal match",
