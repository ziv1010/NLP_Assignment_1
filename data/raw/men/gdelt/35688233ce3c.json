There have been enough teams in recent years that have perhaps surprised some people. With a lot of clubs perhaps not taking the competitions as seriously, I see it as an opportunity.\n“Again, I can’t promise it, we’ve got Exeter [in the Carabao Cup], for instance, they’ll be doing everything they can to do everything they can to cause an upset. A nice short journey for us, but we will be going there trying to win the game.”\nHowever, that doesn’t mean he might not tweak his starting XIs for cup games: “I’m not going to promise that the team won’t be changed because what I want is to try and have a team which is capable of changing.\n“I think gone are the days where too many players play 50 games, 55 games or whatever. But at the same time every time I put a team out on the football pitch it will be very much with the thought that they can win that game of football.\n“That’s what I’ll be looking to do. I don’t like losing games, I didn’t like losing at Braintree as much as results don’t matter in pre-season in some respects. I was glad we didn’t lose any points, but I wasn’t happy about it.\n“If you heard any interviews or comments you probably understood that. I don’t like losing.”\nThe South Yorkshireman says he already feels at home at Portman Road and in Suffolk: “I’m settling in very well, I feel very welcomed from everyone at the football club and the area, if I’m honest, everyone I’ve come into contact with and it does feel like I’ve been here a lot longer than I have. In a good way, I better add that!”\nPhoto: TWTD\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nI know I'll take abuse......but happy to as league is important for us!\nNot only does our league form dive every time but for Christ's sake, cup games are great if you go on a run. No we won't win a trophy but it's nice to dream and surely that is what football is about?\nPlus it's about time we put ourselves back on the footballing map.\nWin against (be it a reserve team) of a big club would show that we have ambition attracting new players and that's without mentioning the revenue.\nJust to complete the domestic set before Hurst wins the champions league...\nAt least if we try to win cup matches, a repeat of that Lincoln debacle won't happen. That was a dark day in our history.\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
