For me, they are the best in the world.\n\"The trophies they have won are clear for all to see, but they are also the best footballing side out there.\"\nKovacic is a four-time Champions League winner having also enjoyed success in Europe's elite competition three times with Real Madrid before joining the Blues.\nThe midfielder, who began his career with Dinamo Zagreb before a spell at Inter Milan, has earned 95 caps for his country.\nCity director of football Txiki Begiristain said Kovacic was a versatile player.\n\"He can play as a 'six' or an 'eight', has plenty of experience at top-level clubs and he understands the Premier League.\n\"It was a very simple decision to bring him to City because he has the tactical and technical qualities we are looking for in a midfielder.\"\n© 2023 AFP",
