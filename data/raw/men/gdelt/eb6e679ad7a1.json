The full cycle of the last 12 months has been a very good journey. From playing in the Champions League, winning two games, then reaching the Durand Cup final, winning the League Winners' Shield to now qualifying for Asia again has been great,\" he added.\nJamshedpur FC made it tough for the Islanders but their quality shone through eventually. Buckingham credited his team's temperament for victory in this crucial fixture.\n\"We knew Jamshedpur FC's threats. They have some good players and are very strong on set plays and that's where they have scored from. Things can quickly unravel but there was no panic. The players that were on the pitch or the ones that came on were very clear about what they wanted to do, so that was very pleasing,\" he said.\nOn the other hand, Jamshedpur FC head coach Aidy Boothroyd felt his team were beaten by a much stronger outfit on the night despite their best efforts to thwart them.\n\"I thought we started the game very well but in the second half, they grew stronger and stronger and made it difficult for us,\" Boothroyd said.\nMumbai City FC and Jamshedpur FC will now be in action in the Super Cup that begins from April 8 in Kerala.\nDisclaimer: This story was supplied by an external content provider; we do not endorse or accept responsibility for its accuracy, completeness, or any outcomes from relying on it.
