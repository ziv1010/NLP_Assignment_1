  "body_text": "I would rather play Liverpool in the semis than…\nEven in defeat, there were wise thoughts and words from Brentford’s rational and astute manager, the aptly named Thomas Frank.\nHe told Eddie Howe that he hopes Newcastle United could go on and win the Carabao Cup after they had beaten his side 3-1 at St James’ Park.\nHe then said starkly, that it would mean more to our football club than it would to the rest left in the competition.\nNewcastle United are the only team left in the competition that isn’t part of the cartel of clubs who are protected by Richard Masters and his cronies at the EPL.\nAs we head into our second League Cup semi final in three seasons, now is the time to fear nobody.\nI have always said that when/if we finally win something, we would have to do it the hard way.\nI’m going to look for a few positives to go with the negatives of having the influential Bruno Guimaraes and Fabian Schar suspended for the first leg of our semi-final.\nFor starters, the likes of Spurs and Arsenal hate coming North to face Newcastle. We can beat either and regularly do.\nIf Manchester United were to overcome Spurs in the last remaining quarter-final, I would definitely fancy us to beat them over two legs.\nNew manager of not, this is the poorest Man Utd team since Sir Alex Ferguson’s side in the late 1980s (it wasn’t always milk and honey for the Salfords under Fergie and he nearly got sacked).\nLiverpool are the best team left and I would rather play them in the semis over two legs than in a one-off at Wembley.\nArne Slot’s side are top of the Premier League and have been impressive so far in this season’s Champions League. Players will be rotated and that is a lot easier for Liverpool to do than their rivals.\nDon’t let those wily scousers ever fool you when they come over all hard done to. They have spent fortunes on that squad.\nThere will still be some players that aren’t regular starters for Liverpool in the league, appearing in the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup though.\nIt feels good for Newcastle United to be only a couple of steps from the twin towers again. Just as good as it it did two years ago.\nLast time we beat Southampton home and away.\nIt will be harder this time but no matter who the Toon get in the semi-final draw, we are capable of reaching the final.\nThis could finally be our year. I and thousands of other Geordies of a certain vintage will have got that feeling again, after the win against Brentford.\nNewcastle 3 Brentford 1 – Wednesday 18 December 7.45pm\n(Stats via BBC Sport)\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nTonali 9, 43 Schar 69\nBrentford:\nWissa 90+1\nPossession was Newcastle 54% Brentford 46%\nTotal shots were Newcastle 23 Brentford 10\nShots on target were Newcastle 5 Brentford 3\nCorners were Newcastle 8 Brentford 5\nTouches in the box Newcastle 35 Brentford 23\nNewcastle team v Brentford:\nDubravka, Livramento, Schar, Burn, Hall (Trippier 77), Tonali, Bruno, Joelinton (Willock 46), Murphy (Barnes 65), Isak (Osula 77), Gordon (Almiron 77)\nUnused Subs:\nVlachodimos, Targett, Lewis Miley, Kelly\n(Two Newcastle United players pick up suspensions on Wednesday night – Harsh – Read HERE)\n(Newcastle 3 Brentford 1 – Instant Newcastle United fan/writer reaction – Read HERE)\nNewcastle United upcoming matches:\nSaturday 21 December – Ipswich v Newcastle (3pm)\nThursday 26 December – Newcastle v Villa (3pm) Amazon\nMonday 30 December – Man U v Newcastle (8pm) Sky Sports\nSaturday 4 January – Tottenham v Newcastle (12.30pm) TNT Sports\nSunday 12 January – Newcastle v Bromley (3pm) BBC iPlayer (FA Cup)\nWednesday 15 January – Newcastle v Wolves (7.30pm) TNT Sports\nSaturday 18 January – Newcastle v Bournemouth (12.30pm) TNT Sports\nSaturday 25 January – Southampton v Newcastle (3pm)\nSaturday 1 February – Newcastle v Fulham (3pm)\nSaturday 15 February – Man City v Newcastle (3pm)\nSunday 23 February – Newcastle v Forest (2pm) Sky Sports\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
