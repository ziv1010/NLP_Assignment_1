  "body_text": "La Liga is back.\nSpain’s top flight returns on Friday evening with two matches — including Sevilla v Valencia — before Real Madrid travel to Athletic Bilbao on Saturday and Barcelona get their title defence under way at Getafe on Sunday.\nHere, our writers look ahead to the 2023-24 season and consider some of the major talking points. Who will finish on top? Who will go down? And who will be the surprise packages?\nLet’s get straight to it.\nAdvertisement\nWho will win La Liga and why?\nTomas Hill Lopez-Menchero: I would have said Real Madrid before Thibaut Courtois’ ACL injury, but losing the Belgium keeper is such a significant blow that I think it puts Barcelona back in the driving seat.\nCourtois has consistently got Madrid out of sticky situations since he joined in 2018 and Andriy Lunin does not inspire the same confidence in his defenders — Madrid not signing a replacement seems unthinkable. Barca have plenty of problems of their own, but Real will need to solve their keeper situation if they truly want to challenge for the Catalans’ title.\nThom Harris: Tricky one. Madrid have brought in Jude Bellingham, but lost Karim Benzema, and Vinicius Junior thrived with the Frenchman’s support last season.\nAtletico Madrid look strong. Antoine Griezmann was untouchable during their fine run of just three defeats in the final 23 games last season, and the signing of Javi Galan will help solve attacking and defensive issues down the left.\nGO DEEPER\nAntoine Griezmann: The quietly brilliant playmaker and Atletico's 'soul' returns to Barca\nFor me, though, it’s hard to look past Barca. Ilkay Gundogan is a wonderful addition to a very talented midfield, while Oriol Romeu will allow Frenkie de Jong, Gavi and Pedri to push forward at will. Inigo Martinez is a great pick-up at centre-back too.\nDermot Corrigan: This could be the closest title race in a while.\nBarcelona surely cannot repeat the almost miraculous defensive record of last year, especially without Sergio Busquets anchoring their midfield.\nAt Madrid, Bellingham is an excellent long-term addition, but it is not yet clear where or how he fits into the starting XI. Their squad looks quite unbalanced, and Courtois missing a big chunk of the season is a huge blow.\nIf Atletico can sustain their form from last year they’d be in with a chance — and they should be much better this year.\nAdvertisement\nIf Madrid sign Kylian Mbappe from Paris Saint-Germain then they would jump back into contention — but barring that, this looks a great opportunity for Atletico.\nGuillermo Rai: Madrid need to bring in Mbappe to make the step up. Without him, they don’t look any better than last year; so Barcelona, as last season’s champions, would be favourites – especially now with Courtois’ injury.\nWho else will qualify for the Champions League?\nHill Lopez-Menchero: I’ll say Madrid will finish second and Atletico third — following a summer in which they have gone back to Diego Simeone basics by signing four defenders in Cesar Azpilicueta, Caglar Soyuncu, Galan and Santiago Mourino.\nIt’s between Real Sociedad, Villarreal and Sevilla for my final Champions League spot. But I’ll go for Sevilla. They haven’t brought in many players this summer, but they’ve kept the bulk of the team who finished last season so strongly under Jose Luis Mendilibar and won the Europa League.\nRai: My picks are the same, but fourth place goes to Real Sociedad. They seem best positioned to reach that position again, as long as participating in the Champions League this season does not affect them too much.\nHarris: I’m predicting the same top four — in the exact same order — as last season: Barca, Madrid, Atletico and Real Sociedad. La Real’s acquisition of Andre Silva is exciting – the striker scored 28 goals in 32 Bundesliga games for Eintracht Frankfurt just three seasons ago, while Umar Sadiq’s return from an ACL injury will only add more firepower up front.\nCorrigan: The fourth and final Champions League spot will be filled by… Real Betis.\nThey lost Sergio Canales but gained Isco and Marc Roca during the summer, which should give them greater solidity and nous throughout the season.\nWho will be relegated and why?\nCorrigan: There is real fear now at Valencia. Los Che just about avoided the drop last year, and now have a remarkably young squad (the average age of registered players at time of writing is 22.8 years).\nAdvertisement\nRayo Vallecano could struggle, having lost coach Andoni Iraola and some key players, while Rafa Benitez has really landed himself in a difficult situation at Celta Vigo.\nThe three promoted clubs all have impressive coaches, but Granada’s Paco Lopez and Alaves’ Luis Garcia have plenty of Spanish top-flight experience, while Las Palmas’ former Barcelona B coach Garcia Pimienta will have his work cut out in his first top-flight campaign.\nHarris: It’s set to be competitive, but I think Alaves, Cadiz and Las Palmas will be the ones to go, with Valencia close by, following a very quiet summer so far.\nRai: I’m going for Mallorca, Granada and Rayo.\nHill Lopez-Menchero: Deportivo Alaves, Valencia and Rayo Vallecano.\nGO DEEPER\nValencia's protesting fan groups and the plan to prise back their football club\nSadly for Valencia, I don’t see their situation improving anytime soon. I don’t think Alaves have enough quality, and Rayo have similar problems to Valencia in terms of fans’ discontent with their club’s owners. They might well struggle after the departure of Iraola, along with several of the players who were so vital to his style of play.\nWho will be top scorer?\nRai: Robert Lewandowski is once again the favourite. Only another big step forward in Vinicius Jr’s goalscoring would stop him (and that shouldn’t be totally ruled out).\nHill Lopez-Menchero: It’s hard to look past Lewandowski, the only world-class striker left in La Liga after the departure of Benzema. I’ll suggest new Villarreal signing Ben Brereton Diaz as my dark horse.\nCorrigan: Unless Madrid sign a new number nine, Vinicius Jr is likely to play much more centrally this season. The new shape might or might not work better for the team, but the Brazilian is likely to be playing closer to goal and will get more opportunities to score, including from the penalty spot.\nHarris: Another outside option could be Youssef En-Nesyri, who rediscovered his scoring touch with the arrival of Mendilibar at Sevilla last season.\nBut, yeah. Lewandowski. I think it has to be.\nAdvertisement\nWhich tactical innovation should we look out for?\nHill Lopez-Menchero: Carlo Ancelotti’s new diamond 4-4-2 formation is definitely worth keeping an eye on. It produced mixed results during Madrid’s pre-season tour of the United States, but the Italian is a master of moulding his system to the players at his disposal…\nCorrigan: Ancelotti’s plan looks good on paper, with Eduardo Camavinga or Aurelien Tchouameni at the base and Bellingham at the tip of that midfield diamond, but it did leave Madrid’s defence very susceptible to attacks down the flanks in pre-season.\nAncelotti’s future job prospects could depend on whether he can make it work, or come up with a better idea.\nHarris: Bordalas ball. The 59-year-old Getafe coach is the pantomime villain of Spanish football, hellbent on breaking up play and hitting on the break with direct, uncomplicated play. Former Barca boss Quique Setien once fumed that Jose Bordalas’s team made his “blood boil” with their “shameful” style of play. He isn’t to everyone’s taste.\nIt isn’t pretty, but it’s hilariously effective, and it will be great fun to see how La Liga’s other 19 teams deal with it.\nWhich player is going to have a breakout season?\nHill Lopez-Menchero: Can you say a player is going to have a breakout season if they’ve already become the youngest La Liga player in Barcelona’s history? Now 16, Lamine Yamal could be given even more opportunities to shine under Xavi this season.\nRai: If you like Pedri, keep an eye out for Alberto Moleiro. Also raised in the Las Palmas youth academy, he is set to make his La Liga debut this season after the Canaries’ recent promotion.\nHarris: Villarreal’s Alex Baena was excellent as he returned from a loan spell in the second tier, combining his appetite for a challenge with relentless creativity and a fantastic ability to strike the ball from range. Still just 22, he will bring a hefty fee for the Yellow Submarine in the near future.\nGO DEEPER\nDembele's departure, Lamine Yamal and the 'Messi dilemma' facing Xavi at Barcelona\nBarcelona’s Moroccan maverick Abde Ezzalzouli is an interesting one to follow. On loan at Osasuna last season, he still looked slightly raw when it came to the final ball, but no one can doubt the winger’s lightning feet and appetite for a dribble. He completed 3.5 take-ons per game last campaign, almost as many as Vinicius Jr.\nAdvertisement\nMy pick, however, is for the similarly electric Mohamed Ali-Cho. Last season the 19-year-old Frenchman played only 587 minutes between injuries at Real Sociedad, but in September we saw an exciting glimpse of his talent in a draw with Atletico Madrid in which he gave Jose Maria Gimenez the runaround down the left flank.\nWhich club will surprise everyone?\nRai: Sevilla could well be the surprise package. Last season was difficult but they still managed to win the Europa League (that trophy never eludes them…) and Mendilibar really turned things around.\nCorrigan: Real Mallorca have been making steady progress for a couple of years now under Mexican coach Javier Aguirre, and have made some clever signings (including Canada international striker Cyle Larin, and playmaker Sergi Darder soon to arrive from Espanyol). That leaves them well set to qualify for UEFA competition for the first time in two decades.\nHarris: I’m very excited to watch Girona again this season, a side with an abundance of exciting attacking options, not least the brilliantly-talented Viktor Tsygankov. Signed for just €5million last January, the Ukrainian is so dangerous drifting in from the right-hand side, and has looked seriously impressive in pre-season.\nHe will be able to link up with fellow countryman Artem Dovbyk, who joins off the back of a 24-goal league season with Dnipro, having netted a famous winner for his country to eliminate Sweden at the delayed European Championship in 2021. A sturdy, proven goalscorer, he should replace the goals of Taty Castellanos with ease.\nYoung winger Savio looks like a fun addition, while Pablo Torre, on loan from Barcelona, should link up well with the ultra-talented Aleix Garcia in midfield. Their full-backs are young and technically gifted too, with Arnau Martinez in particular an excellent defender who likes to advance into midfield.\nA slick-passing system teeming with creative talent, I think they have an outside chance of creeping into Europe, testament to the great work of coach Michel after just one season back in the top flight.\nAdvertisement\nHill Lopez-Menchero: Betis have done some intriguing business this summer and could make an unlikely push for the top four. Hector Bellerin, Roca and Chadi Riad (the latter two both on loan) are all solid signings, but the most exciting arrival is Isco. The former Real Madrid midfielder will be desperate to make up for lost time after mutually terminating his four-month spell with Betis’ city rivals Sevilla last season.\nThe only thing holding them back is their compliance with La Liga’s financial rules — Betis have been unable to register any of their new arrivals so far, so could face a tense start to the campaign.\n(Top photos: Getty Images)",
