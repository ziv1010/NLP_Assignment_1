A dominant first-half performance, featuring a Fabian Ruiz brace, cemented their status as clear favorites to cap an incredible season with the world title.\nParis Saint-Germain showcased their formidable prowess with a stunning 4-0 thrashing of Real Madrid, earning their place in the Club World Cup final against Chelsea. Just a month after their dominant 5-0 victory over Inter Milan in the Champions League final, Luis Enrique's side delivered another emphatic statement, positioning themselves to cap an already incredible season with a world title at New York's MetLife Stadium this Sunday.\nRead More ›\nAny lingering doubts about PSG's progression were swiftly eradicated during a rampant 18-minute spell in the first half. The onslaught began in the sixth minute when a heavy touch from Real Madrid's Raul Asencio inside the box allowed Ousmane Dembele to set up Fabian Ruiz for the opener. Three minutes later, a miskick from Asencio's centre-back partner Antonio Rudiger saw Dembele race through on goal and calmly slot past Thibaut Courtois, doubling Paris Saint-Germain's lead.\nReal Madrid was visibly reeling, and their woes deepened when Ruiz notched his second goal and PSG's third. The goal came from an exquisite passing move, culminating in Achraf Hakimi's precise cut-back to the Spanish midfielder. Despite Real Madrid having lost Trent Alexander-Arnold to injury before the game and bringing on Luka Modric for his final appearance for the club to try and regain a foothold, substitute Goncalo Ramos added a breakaway fourth goal, igniting further celebrations for Paris Saint-Germain.\nRead More ›\nAlready crowned European champions, Paris Saint-Germain will return to the MetLife Stadium on Sunday as strong favorites to defeat Enzo Maresca's Chelsea. A victory would add yet another piece of silverware to their collection, having already secured a domestic double alongside their Champions League triumph. For Real Madrid and their new head coach Xabi Alonso, the immediate challenge is to move past this embarrassing end to their Club World Cup campaign as they prepare for life after veteran midfielder Modric, who received a heartfelt salute from teammates and fans alike following the final whistle.\nEnrique hails 'perfect' Dembele, eyes Ballon d'Or\nParis Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique lauded his side's performance and heaped praise on Ousmane Dembele, suggesting the forward's exceptional season has bolstered his Ballon d'Or hopes. Dembele, playing his first Club World Cup match from the start after returning from a thigh injury, scored his 35th goal of the season.\n\"I feel great,\" Enrique told DAZN. \"It's difficult to play those kinds of matches against Real Madrid. I think we started the game very good and we're happy with the performance. Especially in these conditions - it's too much heat, for me. You need to play in different conditions to watch a better show but I think both teams did it great. We are in a special season, a special moment and I think we deserved to win.\"\nRead More ›\nRegarding Dembele, Enrique added, \"It's the first match in this Club World Cup we can use Ousmane as a normal player because he was injured with the national team and we tried to take care of him. I think he's the best player this season by a long way. He deserves to win everything because he gave everything to the team and the team is going to achieve trophies, which is the most important thing for a club.\"\nMORE FROM FANATİK\nLooking ahead to the final against Chelsea, Enrique remarked, \"We are going to try to win it. One more step against a good team like Chelsea. They performed the whole competition and now it's time for us to prepare for that, try to recover. Almost there; we want to make history for our club and then it's our holidays.\"\nRead More ›\nMidfielder Fabian Ruiz echoed his coach's sentiments, telling DAZN, \"It was an incredible game, a perfect performance, especially considering the heat, the temperature. It was a brilliant performance against a really top team and we're so happy we've gone through. I'm happy for the goals but mostly I'm just happy about the win. Now we just need to celebrate - we're through to the final. It will be difficult, we know they are a good team, but hopefully we can win it and finish the season in the best way possible.\"\nAlonso: A bitter end but there are lessons to learn\nReal Madrid boss Xabi Alonso urged his players to draw lessons from the heavy defeat and paid an emotional tribute to the departing Luka Modric.\n\"For sure we knew the task was really tough being 2-0 down against Paris after 10 minutes,\" Alonso told DAZN. \"At the moment the feeling is not the best but we have to try to learn from today. They are a team that have been building for two years and we are just starting. We have to take time but we have to learn.\"\nRead More ›\nAlonso acknowledged the challenge, stating, \"I think we have not been the last ones to face such a good team. I think, since February, they are in a top moment and today we have faced one of the best teams in the world.\"\nOn Modric's final appearance, Alonso added, \"It's a bitter end for a last game but apart from that he's been a legend of the club, a legend of football. I have been a team-mate, now his coach, but he's a great guy so he is going to be remembered by everyone at Real Madrid.\"\nChelsea faces 'mission improbable' in final showdown\nPSG's performance against Real Madrid was nothing short of exceptional. The team, having played 64 games in 11 months and already secured a treble, displayed relentless energy despite the 35-degree Celsius heat and a stadium packed with Real Madrid fans. Even with a 3-0 lead in the second half, they maintained their aggressive pressing and desire to win back the ball.\nThe current PSG squad appears to have no discernible weaknesses, boasting two of the world's best full-backs, a perfectly balanced midfield, and a sensational front three. Their comprehensive outplaying of Inter Milan last month cemented their status as the best in Europe, and they are now just one game away from becoming FIFA world champions.\nWhile the new Club World Cup may not be universally popular in Western Europe, it clearly holds significant meaning for PSG and the 31 other clubs that fielded full-strength teams in the US this summer. PSG has already defeated European giants like Arsenal, Aston Villa, Liverpool, and Manchester City in the Champions League this season.\nSo, can Chelsea stop this juggernaut, or is it \"mission impossible\"? While nothing is truly impossible, it certainly looks like \"mission improbable\" if PSG replicates this level of performance in Sunday's final.\nParis Saint-Germain will face Chelsea in the Club World Cup final on Sunday at the MetLife Stadium, with kick-off scheduled for 8 PM BST.",
