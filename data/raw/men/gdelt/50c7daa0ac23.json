  "body_text": "What was initially just purely an opportunistic cashgrab has threatened to turn into a real competitive event that we really care about. Chelsea have reached the Club World Cup final, where we could make some proper history by beating the current Champions of Europe and win the inaugural edition of this expanded tournament under FIFA’s new format.\nChelsea vs. PSG, Club World Cup final: Preview, team news, how to watch\nWho will be the Champions of the World?\nBut actually winning it may be a step too far. We’re not only the underdogs, we may be less favored to win than in any other final since the 2012 Champions League final. We are literally the side with the clichéd nothing-to-lose attitude. PSG may not be much older, but they have been all-conquering.\n“Most people around the world would expect PSG to win but we don’t think that in this camp. I remember the first time in this tournament when I did media I said that we’re winners — and we’ve made it this far. That shows I’m not lying. The players have got a really top mentality and we’re really excited going into this final. It’s where we belong to be. We’re confident in ourselves to win the game.”\n-Levi Colwill; source: Goal\nCan it be written in the stars, again?\nDate / Time: Sunday, July 13, 20.00 BST; 3pm EDT; 12:30am IST (next day)\nVenue: MetLife Stadium, East Rutherford, NJ, USA\nReferee: Alireza Faghani, with VAR (same referee we had in the semifinals)\nForecast: Hot and humid as usual, but not as extreme as in some other games; no thunderstorms forecast at the moment either\nOn TV: Channel 5 (UK); TBS, Univision (USA); none (India); SuperSport Premier League (NGA); elsewhere\nStreaming: DAZN (int’l)\nChelsea team news: Moisés Caicedo’s ankle is the main concern heading into tomorrow, with our Player of the Season back in partial training but probably not quite fully fit by tomorrow even in the most optimistic projections. He’s likely to be a gametime decision, with young Andrey Santos (or perhaps Reece James, if Enzo Maresca tries to overcomplicate things) set to deputize if Moi can’t go.\nThe other big decision facing Enzo Maresca is how to set up our attack (other than Pedro Neto and Cole Palmer, who are nailed-on starters). Liam Delap took over from Nicolas Jackson earlier in this tournament, but João Pedro’s arrival has changed the calculus and the new man had himself a most excellent first start in Chelsea Blue in the semifinals when Delap was suspended. Meanwhile, Noni Madueke has packed up and gone to Arsenal. Oh, and Christopher Nkunku is suddenly factoring into things as well, which is an unexpected but certainly not unwelcome surprise.\nThe defense will likely change from the semifinal as well, with Levi Colwill returning from his suspension and presumably getting his starting spot back from either Tosin Adarabioyo or Trevoh Chalobah.\nRoméo Lavia, Dário Essugo, and Benoît Badiashile will miss out due to injuries.\nPSG team news: PSG absolutely romped through the knockout rounds despite facing the likes of Bayern Munich and Real Madrid (and also Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami), scoring ten (10) and conceding zero (0). In fact, the only goal they’ve conceded in the entire tournament was in the shocking 1-0 group stage defeat to Botafogo, which, like Chelsea’s 3-1 loss against Flamengo, only served as a wake-up call.\nGiven their all-conquering nature, and a playing style that seems impossible to deal with in any phase, it’s hard to see how Chelsea could emerge as winners. That said, PSG did lose a couple games in the league — one of them to our BlueCo sister club, RC Strasbourg — and several games during their ultimately triumphant Champions League run, so they’re not invincible.\nPSG had some disciplinary issues in their match against Bayern, with key defenders Lucas Hernández and William Pacho both receiving red cards and suspensions for the rest of the tournament. They weren’t missed against Real Madrid however, with PSG romping easily to a 4-0 victory. Meanwhile Ousmane Dembélé is now back to full fitness and ready to put the finishing touches on his Ballon d’Or campaign.\nPreviously: PSG versus Chelsea used to be a regular occurence in the Champions League a decade ago, with the two teams meeting in three successive knockout rounds, the quarterfinals in 2013-14 (Chelsea advancing on away goals thanks to Demba Ba’s famous goal), the Round of 16 in 2014-15 (PSG winning on away goals thanks to David Luiz and Thiago Silva) and the Round of 16 in 2015-16 (PSG winning 4-2 on aggregate in a fairly straightforward manner). We also ran across each other in the group stage back in 2004. Overall, we’ve won just two of the eight matches, losing three, including the last two in a row.\nLet us Dare to Demba!",
