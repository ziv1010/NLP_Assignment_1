However, the hosts were soon up against it when Araujo was shown a red card in the 29th minute for denying Bradley Barcola a goalscoring opportunity.\nThe 25-year-old was visibly annoyed with his sending off, protesting his innocence, while coach Xavi also saw red in the second half to suffer the same fate.\nAraujo has now spoken after the disappointing exit, thanking his teammates and fans.\nPosting on X, formerly Twitter, he said: \"The football that gave me so much joy, now hits me hard. I thank all those who are unconditionally by my side, my teammates who left everything on the field, and the fans who believed in this team until the end.\n\"I am very sorry not to give you this joy. We will try again. Forca Barca, forever! God in control.\"\nWith Araujo off the pitch, Barca's 4-2 aggregate lead evaporated, with PSG scoring four times without reply to win 4-1 on the night and 6-4 overall.\nXavi was furious afterwards, blaming referee Istvan Kovacs for their exit. But his side will be forced to quickly put the loss behind them, when they face La Liga leaders Real Madrid on Sunday night.",
