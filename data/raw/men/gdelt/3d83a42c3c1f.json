But first, they’ll face Reims in the French Cup final this Saturday. While not their top priority, a win would secure PSG a domestic double, building confidence before their European showdown in Munich on May 31.\nCoach Luis Enrique is keeping his focus on both matches. “We’ve come this far playing our football. Now it’s about showing our full strength,” he said during a press conference this week. PSG have already dominated Ligue 1, finishing 19 points ahead of Marseille, and a Cup win would mark their 16th overall, and eighth in the last decade.\nStar forward Ousmane Dembélé, with 33 goals this season, echoed that sentiment: “We take one thing at a time. The French Cup is important—we want to win every trophy.”\nFor Reims, just reaching the final is a huge achievement—they haven’t been here since 1977. But the timing is tough. They’re in a relegation playoff against Metz, with the final sandwiched between the two legs. Wednesday’s first leg ended 1-1, adding to the pressure.\nDespite that, Reims coach Samba Diawara wants his team to enjoy the moment. “I want the players to savor the final without risking injuries,” he said.\nWhile PSG are clear favorites, Reims can take heart—they held PSG to two draws in the league this season. Still, with the Champions League in sight, Saturday is more about momentum than medals for the Paris giants.\nMore sports, gear and tickets\n- Where to watch NASCAR Truck Series at Daytona tonight: Free live stream\n- How to watch Syracuse lacrosse vs No. 1 Maryland today for free\n- Where to watch USA women’s hockey vs. Italy today: Winter Olympics free stream\n- Where to watch men’s singles figure skating final today: Winter Olympics free stream\n- Where to watch Syracuse women’s lacrosse vs. North Carolina for free today\nGenerative AI was used to produce an initial draft for this story, based on data provided to Syracuse.com.
