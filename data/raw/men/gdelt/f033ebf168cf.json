This means they host the second leg of the tie, which the City boss admitted was an advantage.\n“When you finish 22nd (out of 24) you cannot ask any favour, you cannot ask anything that you didn’t win,” Guardiola said ahead of Tuesday’s first leg at the Etihad.\n“Always I believe what happens in football, normally you have to deserve it and we didn’t deserve it.”\nThe Catalan said he still had faith in his team after a decade of success despite their struggles this season, during which he has had to cope with injuries and a loss of form.\nCity have won six out of the past seven Premier League titles, including the last four in a row, but they are currently in fifth spot and realistically out of the title race.\n“I will not deny how I trust the players that gave us the incredible decade, all of us, winning a lot of things and playing at high standards and I know what we are capable of,” he said.\n“The team has something special and hopefully Tuesday (today) we can prove it.”\nAnd defender Ruben Dias said he believes City can still achieve something “beautiful” this season.\n“Since I have been here this is maybe the most difficult season so far, but I am a firm believer that in the most difficult scenario you can still achieve something beautiful,” the Portugal international said.\n“We know it will be difficult to get there but we have to believe in what we have in the dressing room. With the right belief, we are able to do anything.”\nThe second leg of the playoff tie takes place at Real’s Bernabeu stadium on 19 February.\nTONIGHT\nMan City v Madrid\nBrest v. PSG\nJuventus v. PSV\nSporting v. Dortmund",
