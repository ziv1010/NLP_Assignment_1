In fact, he was all for it!\nThe energetic midfielder admitted: “When the gaffer sat me down and said he was going to rest me I have to confess that I felt I was ready for it. Not only that, having had my rest I definitely felt better for it when I returned to the team.\n“March was incredibly busy and I also had a little dip in form so I could understand the gaffer’s point of view, even if I’m the sort of player who hates missing games.\n“Overall, I think I have done okay. I’ve only missed a few games since I returned from my loan spell at Crawley and it’s not as if I was only in the side to make up the numbers. I won my place — and kept it — on merit.\n“I used to look at the likes of Jimmy Bullard and Lee Bowyer, when they weren’t in the side, and it made me feel good that I was keeping them out. It also made sure I stayed on my toes and took nothing for granted.”\nDrury loves his role in the Town engine room, driving the side on, and he added: “I like to be in the thick of the action. In midfield I always feel as though I’m involved in the game, even if I’m not on the ball.\n“My role isn’t specifically to sit in front of the back four and protect them, nor is it to be bombing forward looking for goals. It’s a bit of both in the manager’s eyes and I just make sure I give 100 per cent all the way through.”\nDrury has come a long way since his part-time days with Sittingbourne, his home-town team, and he is keen to play his part in winning promotion back to the Premiership for Town.\nHe said: “There are a lot of reminders of what Ipswich stands for as a football club. For example, we see a lot of club legends like John Wark and everybody knows what he achieved in the game.\n“John turns up at the training ground quite regularly. He comes into the canteen and likes his grub, but he is held in high esteem by the lads because he’s been there and done it at the very highest level. He likes to pop in for a chat and he’s a top bloke.\n“We recently had six members of the title-winning side of 50 years ago at Portman Road for the renaming of the Sir Alf Ramsey Stand and we made sure we paid our respects to them. They are the heroes from the past and today’s players all want to do their bit in re-establishing Ipswich in the top flight, which is what we are all working hard to achieve.”\nPhoto: Action Images via Reuters\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\nWe have a squad for a reason, but Drury has shown why he is in the team and in my opinion, a cheaper version of Bullard as the creative element of our central midfield.\nUnlike Bullard, he can tackle though and still has that vision at this level to be a good solid player. Drury on probably £5k a week or Bullard on £20k? Doesn't take much to figure out we could spend that £15k difference in wages on a couple of quality up and coming players from the lower leagues and strengthen the squad for the future.\nBowyer could hardly have been worse against Leicester and I suspect he will be released in the summer, so I hope to see Drury start against Palace. Most of us feel Leadbitter will be leaving, so there is an argument to playing Hyam ahead of him too.\nCentral midfield 3 for next season...\nDrury or Leadbitter (if he signs up - if not, a new signing) to do the role above\nHyam or new signing (one of the Derry / Whitehead types we keep missing out on...) to protect the back 4\nI think we're sorted for the role behind the striker with Martin, JET, Stevenson and Bullard\nWhat's with Warky popping down to the old soup kitchen all the time? \"He likes his grub\" alright.\nIf he is tired and plays - and plays badly he will be slagged off, if he admits he is tired he is slagged off.\nI like him - he has energy, can tackle, positionally is not bad, passing is quite good and he has a few tricks that can open up the game. great goal vs bristol, His first real season with us and I see him as a regular next year.\nDoes this just reflect how low my expectations of Ipswich players has dropped to?\nImagine this, Champions League Final : Ipswich 5-1 Barcelona, we'd all be heaven, would be too much to handle, but there is a contingent (we all know who they are) who would critise poor old ALB for letting in that Messi wonder strike and Delany for letting him through and Leadbitter for not sitting tight enough on Xavi for the initial pass and so on......\nNonsenical, totally hypothetical and much exagerrated scenario out of the way to prove my point.......I'm pleased with the way Drury has come on since returning from his loan spell, how we all thought he was going to be sold.\nAs for the rest, as I've said before, it's such small margins that lead to 'player tiredness' and too many games could result in a small reduction of alertness and stamina which could be costly in a game. Jewell and his coaching staff are looking for this type of thing throughout games and training, despite the season we have had, I think Jewell and co are much more qualified than any of us to evalute player fitness and ability.\nPerhaps I could ask my boss for a rest? Paid?\nThis club is very badly run.\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
