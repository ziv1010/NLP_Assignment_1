  "body_text": "FOOTBALL – The revamped Champions League will feature a tennis-style seeding system for the last-16 knockout phase, Uefa said yesterday as it detailed changes to its elite club competition. A semi-automated draw will also replace the manual draw which has become a feature of the competition.\nNext season’s competition will expand from 32 to 36 clubs with the current six groups of four replaced by a single group in which teams face eight games against different opponents. The top eight clubs will automatically qualify for the last 16 while those finishing ninth to 24th face a playoff round to determine the other eight.\nUnlike the current open draw for the last 16, clubs will be seeded in a tennis-style draw depending on their performance in the group phase. This will mean the first and second seeds cannot meet until the final and cannot play the teams seeded third and fourth until the semi-finals at the earliest.",
