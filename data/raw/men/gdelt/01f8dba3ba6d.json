  "body_text": "There was plenty for Mikel Arteta to discuss after we beat Olympiacos 2-0 in our first home Champions League game of the season.\nIn his post-match press conference he was asked about the performance, Martin Odegaard's display, squad depth, Viktor Gyokeres, Gabriel's fitness and more.\nHere's a full transcript...\non his thoughts on our win tonight:\nWell, very happy, obviously winning the Champions League is always very complicated, keeping another clean sheet, we make something like 11 in 14 games, which is remarkable from the boys. I think we started the game really well, I think we looked a real threat, really dynamic, really playing forwards around a lot of threats. Generally to the goal another two or three big chances and we don't put them away in this competition. You have to be careful, the first arrival David had to make an incredible save to deny the goal, which you need in this competition as well.\nAnd after that we had moments of a lot of dominance as you said, and some others that without control and dominating in a direct play we got a little bit deeper, and every time they put balls in the box with the crosses, it's a team that is very, very dangerous. At the end, again, missed two big chances, but at the end found a way with Bukayo to score a goal and breathe a little bit in the first few minutes because it's a team that ended the game really well, I think they won five already this season in the last few minutes, and we discussed that they were going to keep believing until the end, and they made it difficult until the end.\non Odegaard’s performance:\nHe's got all the licence in the world to go forward, Martin, and to play with that freedom and to play with that level of threat especially, not only with the passes, but the way he was taking the ball, carrying the ball, making runs, and arriving in really dangerous areas. I think he put three people through today to score a goal, he should have scored a goal as well, so great to have him back, he played some very good minutes in Newcastle to help us to win the game, and I think today he was phenomenal.\non the depth in our squad this season:\nYeah, with all respect, last season we were looking and we had five academy players there that probably never played professional football in the Champions League, so yeah, it makes a difference. Today we decided to change six players, I think it was, because I want everybody to really be involved and feel part of it, and it was great and we had the feeling as well that physically we were dropping because we played a really intense match in Newcastle a few days ago. The ones that came in, again, they lifted the level and they helped us to win the game, and that's great.\non Gabriel’s fitness after coming off:\nYeah, I think he's going to be OK. He felt something, I think it was a kick, I'm not sure, in the first half, and he was a bit uncomfortable, and towards the second half he was there. He could carry on, but we decided not to take any risks because he's played a lot of games, he's coming from a long-term injury as well, and we need to look after him.\non the history between Arsenal and Olympiacos:\nWell, I don't know, there are stats, and hopefully we broke that one, which wasn't a very positive one. Credit to them, I think the atmosphere they created as well with the away fan, I think it was incredible. I talk about the manager, I know really well as a team, that through their simplicity they become really, really efficient at what they do, and we knew that, and they presented a very tough game, as we expected.\non Gyokeres chasing his next goal:\nWhat I sense is that he's doing better and better things every game, and today he was denied a few times on one of the blocks, and then he hit the post, but I think overall his performance was exceptional. Again, his work was really good, and yeah, we want him to be scoring goals, but if he doesn't do that, at least to do everything as he's doing for the team, because he's helping the team a lot.\non whether the floodgates will open for Gyokeres once he scores again:\nI don't know, but hopefully, yes, and hopefully it will be on Saturday.\non Odegaard’s creative actions tonight:\nI think we have to play in our qualities, and we have a front three with that pace as well, with those timings in the runs, and we have plays we can activate, and we have to do that 100 per cent. He did it in Newcastle a few times in 15 minutes, and that's a game that I want from him.\non Lewis-Skelly’s performance:\nVery good. I think he played a really, really good game. Every level, defensively and attacking, and he looked really focused, he understood really well when to take chances, when to keep the game flowing and very simple, and I'm very pleased with what I've seen today.\non Odegaard’s challenge of being a leader and creator:\nI think that creativity part is his nature, so it doesn't bring any pressure to him because it's his best ability to generate things that not a lot of players can do, and he has total freedom from my side to do and to explore and to tailor his content and to feel the moment and where he needs to generate those spaces, and I think he's certainly done that in the last two games.\non the importance of protecting players with rotation:\nYes, especially with Bukayo because he comes from a long-term injury, he played 45, 60, 70 minutes in a really short period, and today it was more risky, so we decided to keep him.Gabby did really well I think on the right as well and with Declan because he had some incredible outputs three days ago, he's played so many games, he's going to have to play so many games as well, and it's great to have someone like Mikel come in and perform really well and when we need a different profile, bring him in on the pitch.\non facing his former coach Jose Luis Mendilibar:\nWell, great to see him, so glad that he's doing so well, very happy for him. And it's strange at the same moment because he was my coach, so when you have to play against your former coach, it's always something weird. I'm getting older, which I think is good, I learned a lot from him, from my time with him, and it was a good experience, thank God we won the game and I wish him all the best.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
