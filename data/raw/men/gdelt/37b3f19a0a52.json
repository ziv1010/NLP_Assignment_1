  "body_text": "Renée Slegers held her pre-AS FAR press conference at Brentford Stadium on Tuesday evening.\nShe spoke to the media about the latest team news, her thoughts on the FIFA Women's Champions Cup ahead of Wednesday's semi-final and more.\nHere's everything she had to say on the following subjects...\non team news:\nChloe [Kelly] will make her comeback in the squad tomorrow, so she is available for a couple of minutes to build her back. Frida [Maanum] is back in the squad, she’s okay, she trained the full session today, so she’s fully available. For Leah [Williamson], this game comes too soon, but hopefully very soon, she’ll be back with us as well. Kyra [Cooney-Cross], she’s with us, she will be with us tomorrow, but we just have to be really smart with how we manage her and bring her back to full fitness.\non facing an opponent who are used to being dominant in their domestic league:\nThey have been very dominant in their league, they are a lot on the ball, they have quality on the ball, technical players, so we’ll see what they do coming out against us, but from what I understood, they want to leave a mark at this stage and they want to show who they are. So I’m expecting a fearless team out on the pitch tomorrow, and what exactly that means and how they’re going to attack this game we’ll see, we have to plan for different scenarios, but I expect a team wanting to show their identity and be fearless on the pitch tomorrow.\non her thoughts on the Champions Cup:\nWell first of all, very proud that we are part of this competition. We are part of this competition because we won the Champions League last year, and it will be interesting and challenging to measure ourselves against top teams from other continents, so we’re looking forward to the game tomorrow.\non navigating a hectic schedule against opponents who are in their off-season:\nScheduling is important for us because there’s a lot of games, but like I said we’re proud to be in this competition and we want to compete. We want to compete for trophies, this is a new trophy in women’s football. I think Arsenal have been trailblazers for long and we want to be part of that and we want to make history as well. So again, we’re very proud to be in this competition.\non our style compared to the other teams in the competition:\nI want to believe that we have a little bit of everything. I think we have very intelligent and technically gifted players in the squad. We have a clear identity on how we want to play. We like to dominate the ball. We want to have the ball as much as possible. But we also want to be direct in moments. The physical side of the game is important in the league we play in and getting more and more important in Europe as well. So we need to impose ourselves physically as well. I want to believe that we have a little bit of everything.\non strengths we can use against AS FAR:\nWhat we have to understand, as a team, is that there will be unknowns. We have to be comfortable with not knowing certain things, because we've never played against this opponent. We've seen them, you watch the video, but then what is it going to be like to actually play against them? So, that's going to be important for the players. Of course, they have an identity and a style of play. We have an identity and a style of play. How are both teams going to match that against each other? What does that mean for them, that we are a team that likes to be on the ball and likes to dominate possession? They have been doing that in their leagues. How are they going to adjust to that? How are we going to adjust to a new team that we haven't played against with a lot of passion? There's athleticism, there's rotations, there's ideas and bravery on the ball. So, it will be, like I said, an unknown. We have to be comfortable not knowing exactly that when the game starts. But we are, of course, in a good place as a team. We have been playing a lot of games back-to-back. We got a good result against Chelsea. We've had good performances. So, we're in a good place. So, we have to come here, of course, and present ourselves with a lot of confidence going into this game tomorrow.\non what winning the Champions Cup would mean to her:\nWe're in four competitions and we want to go for every trophy. So, winning trophies is always going to be special for players, for me and my role as well. Like I just mentioned, it's the first time so we can make history here. That will be very special for us.\non if she’d have preferred the semi-final and final to be at a different stage of the season:\nIt's the scheduling again. We are playing a lot of games at the moment. But we also have a lot of players available. So, we have a squad to be able to manage these schedules. And it's always a puzzle to make that work as good as possible. But, we're ready for it. We're ready for it tomorrow and we're ready for the weekend.\non how important the prize money could be:\nThe game is growing, so, it's good, I think, that there is more money to be invested back into the game. So, that's really positive. It's needed to be able to grow all areas in the game at the same speed. What we are focused on, what I am focused on, is the silverware that we can win. I think us as staff and players, we want to win trophies.\non what it would mean to the WSL for an English team to win the competition:\nI think we're talking scenarios now. And hypothetically speaking, if that would happen, then I think England should be very proud as a country. That's, I think, what we mentioned after winning the Champions League as well. We won it as Arsenal last year, but it says something about how the country, the FA and the clubs have been investing. And that would be exactly the same for this competition.\non AS FAR and the importance of this competition for countries like Morocco:\nI think it's very good that there is a platform and I understand AS FAR coming here and participating in this tournament, because I think they were probably an unknown name for a lot of people. So they get the opportunity, get the platform to show themselves globally, which is very good for the growth of the game. And I think what's positive, hopefully tomorrow, you see a really good game of football, two teams presenting something really positive, and the game grows. And to be fair, I don't know exactly all the names of the teams in Morocco in the league. I try to keep track of my own league and the closest ones! But it's something positive, I think, that it's happening, and it gives them a great platform. And it's positive that the game is growing in all areas.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
