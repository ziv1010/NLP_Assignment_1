He is extremely successful and will serve Galatasaray for many years,” the 76-year-old said in quotes revealed by Fanatik.\n“It may be said that the amount we transferred (to Napoli) was high, but today the price of the football public service is low and the player’s value is much higher.\n“Every footballer’s contract we make is very transparent. Contracts in accordance with the rules of TFF and UEFA. Our values that suit Galatasaray and our march to success will continue unchanged,” the Turk concluded.\nThe club’s vice president, Abdullah Kavukçu, also joined in to laud the former LOSC Lille striker for his brilliance in front of goal.\n“There are players in the world worth €140m, but Osimhen is more talked about. They put in a bid much higher than ours in Naples, you can confirm.\n“There’s been a lot of talk, we got it in the final. We had money like that, we got it! Galatasaray is a very big community.\n“He’s worth it, and it’s been done. It’s not right to talk about this right now! We’ve seen what he’s doing in a game in the Champions League. We’re so happy he’s with us,” the 52-year-old concluded.",
