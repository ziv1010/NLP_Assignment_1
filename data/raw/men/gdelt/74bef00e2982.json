Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nBefore he suffered the knock, Saka massively impressed on his injury return for Arsenal and caused Real Madrid all kinds of defensive problems.\n‘He was key,’ Arteta added. ‘Again, he elevates the level of the team. There’s a fear factor every time he’s on the ball. Teams step off him and that creates space.’\nAlan Shearer, who was on commentary duties for Amazon Prime, claimed Real Madrid defender David Alaba ‘didn’t have a clue’ how to handle Saka.\nDuring the match, Shearer said: ‘Bukayo Saka is causing all sorts of problems. David Alaba doesn’t have a clue if he’s going to cut in on his left or go down the outside of his right.\n‘That’s all you can do as a winger. Your job isn’t always to pick a player out, it’s just to put a ball into the middle.’\nMeanwhile, Arteta was left delighted with his team’s overall performance against Real Madrid and Rice’s two world-class goals from free-kicks.\n‘So happy, so proud of the team,’ Arteta added. ‘We have the opportunity to make a lot of people proud and we certainly have done that.\nMore Trending\n‘I’ve never seen the stadium like this. Before the game they were already singing and already playing the game.\n‘For big European nights you need the big stadiums that create atmosphere and you need individual magic moments and there you go.\n‘That’s the beauty of whoever invented this sport. We hadn’t scored a free-kick since September, 2021.\n‘And tonight, against Real Madrid at home in the Champions League, we scored two in 13 minutes.’\nMORE: Wesley Sneijder disagrees with Declan Rice free-kick ‘magic’ after Arsenal beat Real Madrid\nMORE: Real Madrid suffer two injury concerns during Arsenal defeat in Champions League",
