After all, Los Blancos have proven the doubters wrong time and time again when European silverware is the prize.\nHowever, the 53,000-strong crowd at the Etihad may have witnessed the passing of the continental torch, as Man City tore the reigning champions to shreds with goals from Bernardo Silva (2), Manuel Akanji and Julian Alvarez, making them the firm favourites to finally end their Champions League hoodoo in Turkey.\nSince teaching their La Liga adversaries a footballing lesson, Man City successfully defended their Premier League title with 89 points to stave off the threat of Arsenal – whose challenge was a floundering one at best late on – before winning just their second FA Cup under Guardiola versus bitter rivals Manchester United.\nRead Also: Man City must disregard history in UCL final, says Guardiola\nAmid incessant speculation surrounding his future, Man City’s end-of-season specialist Ilkay Gundogan sparkled in the Wembley sunshine – netting a beautiful opener within just 12 seconds, the fastest goal ever scored in an FA Cup final – before letting fly with another volley in the second half to render Bruno Fernandes’s penalty inconsequential and put Man City on the brink of a terrific treble of trophies.\nFor all of their Etihad excellence this term, Man City’s triumph at Wembley marked just their third win from their last seven games away from their headquarters, with Guardiola’s side failing to win either of their last two European road matches against Real Madrid or Bayern Munich, but few Citizens supporters will be overly concerned with recent failures on Brighton & Hove Albion and Brentford’s territory.\nScoring at least once in each of their last seven Champions League affairs, Man City could become the fourth team from England to lift the Champions League trophy aloft in the tournament’s current format. Only one other nation also boasts three previous victors in the competition, and they will be sending a crop of resilient representatives indeed. Inter’s attempts to thwart Napoli’s Serie A title mission proved futile, but while the pre-match discussions may be centred on Man City’s bid for a domestic and continental treble, a similar haul of success is on the line for Simone Inzaghi’s knockout gurus.\nFour months on from trouncing city rivals Milan 3-0 in the 2022-23 Supercoppa Italiana, Inter posted an identical triumph over their Rossoneri foes in the final four of the Champions League – albeit over 180 minutes rather than 90 this time around – to return to Europe’s grandest stage in some style.\nFollowing a 2-0 first-leg success where they were billed as the ‘away’ team at San Siro, Inter extinguished any wafer-thin hopes of a Milan fight back through Lautaro Martinez’s second-half strike in the second leg on May 16, thereby advancing to a European final for the 11th time in their illustrious history.\nEight days later, Inter clinched a Supercoppa Italiana and Coppa Italia double by putting Fiorentina to the sword 2-1 in the showpiece of the latter – the first of two final heartbreaks for the Viola, whose dreams of Europa Conference League glory ended in tears against West Ham United – and Inter will be out to avoid sharing the same fate as their Calcio counterparts when they step out for just their second Champions League final.\nTwo-time winners of the European Cup in its old format, Inter’s dry spell in the Champions League now stands at 13 seasons since serial continental champion Jose Mourinho – at least until this year – oversaw a 2-0 win over Bayern Munich in the 2010 final, where Argentina’s Diego Milito was the two-goal hero in Madrid.\nThe Argentine’s legacy is certainly being continued by one of his countrymen in Martinez, who alongside ex-Man City striker Edin Dzeko should form the two-man strikeforce hoping to fire the Nerazzurri to a seventh continental honour; the Italian powerhouses also have a trio of UEFA Cup coups from the 1990s to boast about.\nMuch has been made of Man City’s affinity for goal-laden showings, but Inter’s dogged defence has kept five clean sheets in six Champions League knockout matches in 2022-23 – the one aberration being their 3-3 quarter-final second-leg draw with Benfica – and only Arsenal’s beaten finalists in 2005-06 have recorded six knockout shut-outs before.\nA springtime lull prevented Inter from staking their claim for another Scudetto, but the Nerazzurri board the plane to Istanbul having won 11 of their last 12 games across all competitions, while they have only failed to make the net ripple in one of their last 17 contests.\nInzaghi’s charges will walk out to the Champions League theme as just the fourth team to reach the final after losing their opening match of the tournament, after Milan in 1994-95, Bayern Munich in 1998-99 and Tottenham in the 2018-19 season. However, all three of those outfits ended up walking past the trophy en route to collecting their runners-up medals, and Inter will join that unwanted club unless they can discover the formula to prolong Man City’s European gloom.",
