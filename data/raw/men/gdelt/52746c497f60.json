  "body_text": "Tottenham Hotspur are now stepping up their pursuit of the Liverpool attacking midfielder Harvey Elliott.\nThe 22-year-old has been linked with a move away from the Premier League champions. He needs to play regularly at this stage of his career, and Liverpool will not be able to provide him with that opportunity.\nElliott has been linked with RB Leipzig as well.\nHarvey Elliott needs a fresh start\nThe move to Tottenham could be ideal for him. According to a report from football transfers, Tottenham manager Thomas Frank has personally outlined his plans for the 22-year-old. The north London outfit are now ready to step up their pursuit of the player.\nIt remains to be seen whether they can get the deal across the line. Elliott has proven himself to be a quality player for Liverpool, and he has shown his ability during his cameos. He was outstanding for England during the under-21 Euros earlier this summer as well.\nSpurs could use Elliott\nThere is no doubt that he has the quality to develop into a top-class Premier League star. He is capable of operating on the flanks as well as centrally. He will help create goal-scoring opportunities for his teammates and find the back of the net as well. James Maddison has been sidelined for several months with ACL damage, and Tottenham need to replace him. Signing the Liverpool player would be a wise decision.\nLiverpool are unlikely to stand in his way if there is a substantial offer on the table. It remains to be seen whether Tottenham follow up on their interest with an official proposal to get the deal done.\nMeanwhile, the 22-year-old will look to get his career back on track with regular football as well. He will want to compete at a high and Spurs would be the ideal destination. They could offer him Champions League football for the next season.",
