The match restarted around 20 minutes later after Atletico players spoke with balaclava-wearing supporters in the stands, with home striker Angel Correa eventually scoring a 95th-minute equaliser to cancel out Eder Militao’s opener.\nSo what happened and what could the consequences be?\nWhy was the game stopped?\nThe trouble started after Militao’s 64th-minute strike. As Courtois celebrated, objects were thrown towards him from the section of the ground where Atletico’s radical ‘ultra’ fans congregate, behind the goal at the south end of the Metropolitano.\nCourtois, who played for Atletico from 2011 to 2014, brought this to the attention of referee Mateo Busquets Ferrer and an announcement was made over the stadium loudspeakers, following La Liga protocol in such circumstances, saying the game could be suspended if the behaviour didn’t stop.\nMeanwhile, Busquets Ferrer gathered both teams near the centre circle. Atletico captain Koke spoke with Courtois and then he and Atletico defender Jose Maria Gimenez ran behind the goal to speak with the fans. Manager Diego Simeone also approached them, making a ‘calm down’ gesture.\nBoth teams then went down the tunnel as the stadium announcer confirmed a 10-minute suspension and a warning that “if this behaviour does not stop, the game will not be finished”.\nAfter around 10 minutes had passed with both teams in the dressing rooms, another announcement told supporters that the game would restart in five minutes. There were then loud whistles as Madrid’s players returned and began a warm-up. Courtois also went back to take his place.\nTV cameras showed Simeone giving his players a pep talk in the tunnel before they returned to restart the game. Simeone then gestured again to the Atletico ‘ultras’ behind Courtois’ goal, putting his fingers to his head, asking them to think.\nBusquets Ferrer’s report later stated that objects, including three lighters and a bottle of water, were thrown towards Courtois in the 64th, 65th and 67th minutes. The report said captains and delegates from both teams, match directors, the security coordinator and a Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) delegate gathered in the match officials’ dressing room and were warned the game would be suspended if the throwing of objects continued. Play eventually resumed 17 minutes after the stoppage, according to the referee’s report.\nAdvertisement\nCorrea bundled home a goal in the fifth minute of stoppage time to give Atletico a point, with Marcos Llorente also shown a red card in the 99th minute for a challenge on Real substitute Fran Garcia.\nWho are the Atletico ultras?\nThe ‘Frente Atletico’ fans group was formed in the 1980s and has a reputation for holding radical right-wing views and being involved in violence.\nIn 1998, Real Sociedad supporter Aitor Zabaleta was attacked and killed by Frente Atletico members in a bar near Atletico’s old Estadio Vicente Calderon stadium.\nDeportivo La Coruna ultra Javier ‘Jimmy’ Romero Taboada died after a pre-organised fight between Deportivo and Atletico fans before a game at the Calderon in November 2014.\nIn May 2018, an Atletico ultra was fined €3,005 (£2,500; $3,400 at current rates) and banned from all sports facilities for 12 months after launching a balloon featuring a Nazi swastika symbol from the crowd during a goalless draw at home to Real Betis the previous month.\nThat year, Atletico were also ordered to close a section of their stadium after fans displayed a far-right banner during the Europa League final against Marseille. In 2022, they were ordered to do the same after a supporter made a Nazi-style salute — although this was overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\nIn recent years, Atletico’s decision-makers have taken steps to distance the club from their radical fans, moving to end links that had included space to store flags and material in the Calderon and preferential access to match tickets for home and away games. In 2014, Atletico de-registered Frente Atletico as an official fan group.\n“We cannot expel the entire sector because there are some good people in that (area of the ground),” club chief executive Miguel Angel Gil Marin told Spanish TV station Cuatro after calls for the Frente Atletico to be banned outright following Taboada’s death in 2014. “It is impossible to have control over those who say they are Atletico fans and then behave outside the values of sport.”\nAdvertisement\nAtletico continue to have an emotional connection with their more hardcore supporters. Players traditionally celebrate good results with that section of the stadium after games, a ritual that also took place on Sunday night.\nWhy was there so much tension around this game?\nThere has been plenty of controversy around the Madrid derby in recent years.\nVinicius Jr has regularly been the subject of racist abuse before, during and after matches, most notoriously last year when a mannequin dressed to resemble the Brazilian was hanged by its neck from a bridge near Real’s Valdebebas training ground before a Copa del Rey derby. In December, four members of Frente Atletico were charged over that incident.\nFans have previously chanted, “Vinicius, you are a monkey!” outside the Metropolitano and, in the build-up to Sunday’s derby, posts on social media, apparently made by Atletico fans, called on fans to wear masks to the game so they could abuse Vinicius Jr with impunity. No racist abuse of Vinicus Jr was reported by authorities immediately following the game.\nBefore kick-off on Sunday, Atletico president Enrique Cerezo said nobody at the club was “anti-racist or racist” — before backtracking and saying “we all have a responsibility to fight against racism” later in the day.\nThe Athletic did not witness any racist chants against Vinicius Jr in the vicinity of the Metropolitano before kick-off, but it was far from a calm atmosphere.\nHundreds of fans chanted, “Vinicius, you are different!” at the entrance to the stadium’s south end, where Atletico ultras tend to sit. There was also tension when some fans passed by wearing Real Madrid shirts against the backdrop of a heavy police presence.\nThere were chants of, “Sons of b****es” aimed at Madrid supporters and some fans threw bottles and leftover food at them. Some supporters who filmed the scenes on their phones had objects thrown at them.\nAdvertisement\nHome fans did not forget Vinicius Jr once inside the stadium. His name attracted the most jeers of all the Madrid players when the line-ups were read out and he was whistled whenever he touched the ball.\nWhy was Courtois picked out?\nCourtois has regularly been a target for Atletico supporters since he joined Real Madrid in 2018. He spent three years at Atletico during one of their most successful periods, winning La Liga and reaching the Champions League final in 2014 (where they lost to Real).\nAtletico fans have been angered by Courtois’ comments since he joined Madrid, which they have taken as a lack of respect for his former team. The Belgian has a plaque, which is often vandalised before Madrid derbies, on Atletico’s Centenary Players’ Walk as he made more than 100 appearances for the team.\nGO DEEPER\nCourtois and Atletico: Stuffed rats, smashed plaques and angry letters\nCourtois’ plaque was once again full of debris on Sunday night and during the match, he was whistled every time he touched the ball.\nHave matches in Spain been stopped before?\nIn January 2022, a Copa del Rey round-of-16 game between city rivals Real Betis and Sevilla was abandoned after an object thrown from the stands hit Sevilla midfielder Joan Jordan on the head.\nThat game was replayed behind closed doors at the Benito Villamarin stadium 24 hours later, with no fans admitted. The RFEF ordered a partial closure of Betis’ ground as punishment, but the club overturned the ruling on appeal. They were ultimately fined €36,000.\nWhen Valencia fans racially Vinicius Jr at their Mestalla stadium in May 2023, play was temporarily stopped while the stadium’s speaker system broadcast calls for abuse from the stands to stop.\nThe RFEF at first ordered a partial closure of Mestalla for five games, which was reduced to three games on appeal. Valencia were eventually fined €27,000.\nGO DEEPER\nThe shocking abuse Real Madrid's Vinicius Jr faced at Valencia revealed in new report\nJust last Thursday, Espanyol’s game against Villarreal in La Liga was temporarily suspended after a fan threw a bottle of water at the referee.\nAdvertisement\nThere have been many other incidents of objects being thrown onto the pitch. When speaking after Sunday’s game, Simeone recalled when Courtois was hit by a lighter thrown at him by fans at Real Madrid’s Estadio Santiago Bernabeu, when Atletico won the 2013 Copa del Rey final at their neighbours’ home. No action was taken.\nCristiano Ronaldo was hit by a lighter thrown by Atletico fans at their old Calderon home in February 2014. Atletico were then fined €6,000, with the RFEF committee deeming the offence to be “light”.\nWhat did managers and players say?\nSimeone blamed his side’s ultras, but also said Courtois should not have provoked fans. He reminded reporters that the same thing had happened to Courtois as an Atletico player at Real’s Santiago Bernabeu ground in 2013.\n“The club will have to take a decision on those who have provoked these incidents,” he said at a press conference. “We don’t need those people. But that doesn’t justify the situations that incite that. Be careful: sanction the one who provokes and the one who throws the lighter.”\nAtletico captain Koke also spoke after the game. “What we wanted was to play and for it not to happen anymore,” he said. “Our people said they felt provoked and that’s why they wanted to defend themselves. But they can’t throw things.”\nMadrid manager Carlo Ancelotti said: “Nobody liked stopping the game, but he (the referee) did the right thing.”\nWhat punishments could Atletico face?\nThe RFEF will analyse Busquets Ferrer’s match report before deciding what action will be taken.\nThe decision will be made by the RFEF’s disciplinary committee, which regularly meets on Wednesdays. On Monday, La Liga’s anti-violence committee was due to hold a session at which the events of last night’s game would be discussed. The anti-violence committee only has the power to propose a sanction, while the RFEF’s disciplinary committee will ultimately rule on what action will be taken.\nAdvertisement\nThere are various punishments available to Spanish football authorities, including fines and a total or partial stadium closure, depending on how severe the offence is judged to be.\nAfter the game, Atletico released a statement: “Atletico Madrid wishes to express its rejection of the throwing of objects that took place from a section of the south stand in the 68th minute of the match vs Real Madrid.\n“The club’s security department has been working with the police to locate those involved, one of whom has already been identified. The club will apply the internal regime foreseen for very serious cases to the people involved in this incident.\n“These attitudes have no place in football and tarnish the image of a stadium that has experienced a spectacular atmosphere with more than 70,000 spectators in the stands, the vast majority of whom have shown exemplary behaviour.”\nOn Monday, Spain’s minister of education, vocational training and sports Pilar Alegria condemned Sunday’s “intolerable” events and expressed her “total rejection of violent behaviours that are damaging Spanish football”.\n(Top photo: Oscar del Pozo/AFP via Getty Images)",
