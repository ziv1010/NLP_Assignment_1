If you have an astrological mind, you know that the occurrence we just experienced is also the symbol of realignment, fate and destiny *cough, cough USWNT*. I’m Emily Olsen here with Meg Linehan, Steph Yang and Jeff Rueter — welcome to Full Time!\nYEAH, SCIENCE! 🌒☀️ pic.twitter.com/sXLA14aQgC\n— U.S. Women's National Soccer Team (@USWNT) April 8, 2024\nRoad To Paris\nUSWNT advances to SheBelieves Cup final\nThe U.S. women’s national team is headed to the final of the ninth edition of the SheBelieves Cup thanks to a 77th-minute penalty kick goal from Lindsey Horan in a 2-1 win over Japan. The tournament continued Saturday with Canada coming back to beat Brazil on penalties.\nAdvertisement\nThe U.S. will face Canada in the final on Tuesday, April 9 at 7 p.m. ET in Columbus, Ohio a month after their fateful, and waterlogged, meeting in the semifinal of the inaugural CONCACAF W Gold Cup. This time the winner will get a trophy. (I am intentionally not saying anything more about the weather).\nThe match against Japan was played in front of 50,644 fans, the largest USWNT domestic crowd size since the 1999 Women’s World Cup final, and the U.S. showed an element of joy that was lacking during last year’s World Cup.\nJapan struck first, becoming the first opponent to score against the USWNT in the opening minute since 2003. Despite the early setback, the U.S. was soon on the front foot, utilizing an aggressive, high-pressing style of play.\nJaedyn Shaw found the equalizer in the 21st minute, set up by midfielder Sam Coffey. If becoming the first USWNT player to score in her first five consecutive starts wasn’t enough to make Shaw an Olympic lock, the versatility she showed dropping into the role of playmaker did. At least in my book — but from here on out it’s up to head coach Emma Hayes.\nJae's stunning strike 💫💫💫#USWNT x @att pic.twitter.com/kAqdNpDEB4\n— U.S. Women's National Soccer Team (@USWNT) April 7, 2024\nOn the ground in Columbus\nI would be remiss if I didn’t check in with Steph Yang, who was in Atlanta and now Columbus for the games. How is training going for the two finalists?\nSteph: The USWNT practiced at the host venue Lower.com Field, while Canada was at Ohio State’s Jesse Owens Field. The setups track with what the teams did in Atlanta: the U.S. practiced at Atlanta United’s $60M training grounds in Marietta, and Canada practiced on Georgia State’s somewhat cramped but still nicely kept field downtown.\nIt’s not entirely fair to call it a reflection of each team’s respective investment from their federation; Canada had the option of using Lower.com, and the Brazil WNT also trained at the host venue. But there are logistical tradeoffs. Ohio State allowed Canada more flexible timing, but Canada staff spent time scooping goose droppings off the field with practice cones to clear it for the players while the Ohio State women’s pole vaulting team practiced in the background.\nAdvertisement\nThe Olympic question\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics start on July 25 for the U.S. against either Zambia or Morocco. The USWNT will look to add to its four gold medals (1996, 2004, 2008, 2012), one silver (2000) and one bronze (2020).\nGO DEEPER\nUSWNT draws Germany, Australia for Olympics\nOnce Hayes arrives in May, the team will have two windows of international friendlies to get the final pieces in place for the 18-player roster. There will be some tough decisions come July.\nTalent isn’t the only thing considered for roster spots. Versatility is also (if not more) important — which brings us to how interim head coach Twila Kilgore deployed Shaw against Japan.\nShaw has previously been slotted in on the wing, but on Saturday she lined up in the playmaking No. 10 role and delivered. Her growing chemistry with her San Diego Wave teammate Alex Morgan can only help both with their Olympic hopes.\nRight now, I’d say my locks for Paris are Shaw, Horan and Naomi Girma. Morgan and Coffey elevated their stock with the performance on Saturday and Swanson is nearly a lock, but she only just returned to the team after a year away.\nGirma, who has cemented herself as a must-start player for the U.S. defense left the game against Japan in the 18th minute. After the game, Kilgore said she was being evaluated for a right thigh injury.\nThe Athletic’s Steph Yang details how the USWNT’s chemistry was on display against Japan, showcasing a revitalized attack.\nMeg’s Corner: The main event(s)\nUp here in Vermont, we were in the path of totality for the solar eclipse. This whole weekend felt like one big lead-up to the main event, so there was plenty of eclipse talk — but I also heard plenty of women’s basketball discussions too, about Caitlin Clark, the national championship game, and TV records falling one after the other.\nWe’ve been dreaming and expecting and waiting for times like these for how long in women’s sports? These moments keep coming so often that it’s the new normal.\nThis weekend, Atlanta set a new record for USWNT attendance for a friendly. On Monday, U.S. Soccer also broke ground on its new national training center and headquarters in Georgia.\nThe location opens many new doors for U.S. Soccer, and some potential complications too, especially considering legislation in the state on reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ people, and guns. That’s a story for another day, with much greater nuance than I’m getting into here — and it’s not just a U.S. Soccer issue, either. What is specific to the federation and sport is the motto of One Nation, One Team, and what U.S. Soccer has a chance to physically — and symbolically — build.\nAdvertisement\nAhead, there’s potentially a massive opportunity with the 2026 World Cup, maybe the 2027 World Cup, then the 2028 Olympics. The same way so many of us were shaped by 1994 and 1999 and the mark those tournaments left, the sport is preparing for another formative, foundational change.\nWe’re in historic times, after all. Happy eclipse season!\nHi, my name is: Lily Yohannes\nThough she’s not officially cap-tied to the U.S., 16-year-old Lily Yohannes received her first call-up to the senior team as part of the SheBelieves Cup roster. Last year, she became the youngest player to start a group stage match in the UEFA Champions League, and it’s clear the Ajax midfielder is one Hayes is keeping tabs on.\nTamerra Griffin traveled to Amsterdam for The Athletic to meet Yohannes, and has the exclusive look at who she is, the risk her family took to pursue football dreams and the Virginia Habesha community that helped raise her.\nRead more about the player Hayes called a “tremendous talent.”\nThe latest on Korbin Albert\nAnother player on the USWNT fans’ radar is Korbin Albert, but at the moment it’s for off-field reasons. Albert subbed into the match against Japan and is available for selection against Canada amid public backlash for her social media activity, which included anti-LGBTQ+ messaging.\nOn Saturday, Albert subbed on for Coffey, who was being evaluated for a head injury, as part of a triple change in the 78th minute, alongside Macario and defender Crystal Dunn. There was some reaction from the crowd in Atlanta when her name was announced in the stadium. Fans in the stands reported heavy booing, but from the press box, the reaction registered as more scattered.\nMORE: Can U.S. Soccer punish Korbin Albert for social media activity?\nOn Wednesday, Horan and Morgan delivered a prepared statement to reporters addressing Albert’s social media activity.\n“We’ve worked extremely hard to uphold the integrity of this national team through all of the generations, and we are extremely, extremely sad that this standard was not upheld,” Horan said.\nAdvertisement\nCheck out the latest Athletic newsletter\nGet the top stories in international soccer directly to your inbox with our latest newsletter, The Athletic FC.
