In their first full season under Eddie Howe last year, they finished 3rd in the league, above the likes of Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham.\nAnd they are planning to build on to their success from last season by investing further into the team as they prepare for Champions League football next season.\nThey are reportedly on the verge of clinching the signing of Sandro Tonali from AC Milan for a whopping €70m. Fabrizio Romano confirmed that a deal has been reached between all parties and that the deal is ‘done and sealed’.\nSandro Tonali deal is completed but will not be announced today or this week as it takes time to complete formal details. ???? #NUFC\nAll documents are in place, the deal is done and sealed. No doubts. Contract will be valid for 6 years. https://t.co/FfbkzFsMiH\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) June 23, 2023\nAnd according to the latest report from the Italian transfer expert, Newcastle plan on shifting their focus on James Maddison next.\nThey have been strongly linked with him since last year. They made two bids for the midfielder last summer but saw both rejected by Leicester who demanded £60m.\nNow that Leicester have been relegated, Maddison is expected to leave and both Newcastle and Spurs have been linked with a move for him.\nSpeaking with GiveMeSport, Romano claimed Maddison remains a target for the Magpies:\nHe said: “It’s true that they want Tonali and they are closing in on him. For sure he was on the list at Newcastle alongside of course Maddison, who remains a target for Newcastle and Tottenham.”",
