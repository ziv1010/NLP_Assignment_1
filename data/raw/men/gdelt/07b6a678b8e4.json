The game was pretty much in the balance, a big moment in our season.\n“I think Sandro has done really well since returning from suspension, he trained very well during his ban, he was outstanding with his attitude.\n“He really saw it as a chance to develop his game, he spent a long time on the training pitch doing that.\n“Without 11 v 11 work, or match action, that is very difficult to do.\n“I think in fairness we have also seen a big uplift since he has changed position.\n“I think that was maybe a turning point in his career here.\n“I think he looks a lot more comfortable in the position he is playing now.\n“I have to say that defensively, I think he has been outstanding for us, with his athleticism and ability to read danger.\n“That has been of the highest level and it goes without saying, technically he is very good.\n“He makes very good decisions on the pitch consistently and that’s what makes him the player he is.\n“Not necessarily outstanding moments, but when you add them together, a very forceful performance from midfield.”\nEddie Howe on Alexander Isak:\n“You are defined by your ability to score goals in this league.\n“Your attacking players really have to take on that responsibility.\n“I think he has done that unbelievably well since he’s been here, not easy to do.\n“I don’t think this was his finest game and I don’t think he will be surprised at me saying that, but he was right place, right time, maybe got a bit of luck with the finish.\n“But he has done that consistently, always in the right place.\n“I think on another day he would have scored more, but I don’t think he was one hundred per cent, so that is why we withdrew him. We hope that it’s nothing too serious but he just wasn’t feeling one hundred per cent in his groin.\n“He was just a little bit unsure in his movement and so that’s why we withdrew him.”\nEddie Howe on Kieran Trippier:\n“He said that it was like a cramp sensation in his groin.\n“We hope it’s nothing serious.\n“We have got a few niggles and we just hope they are nothing serious.\n“We have such a small squad, as you could see from our bench, so we can’t afford to pick up any more injuries.”\nEddie Howe on Joelinton:\n“I think Joe epitomises the mentality that we need.\n“It is win at all costs.\n“He is always there for you in training, he is always there for me.\n“He’s a standard bearer in that respect and you need players like that, to set the example for everyone else to follow.\n“I think his knee was causing him a bit of discomfort today, it is the knee that he has suffered from before.\n“I don’t think he was one hundred per cent fit but it would have taken a lot for Joe to have come off the pitch.\n“We need to assess every little niggle we have and make sure everyone is okay for Monday.”\nNewcastle 2 Brentford 1 – Wednesday 2 April 7.45pm\n(Stats via BBC Sport)\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nIsak 45+2, Tonali 74\nBrentford:\nMbeuno 66 pen\nPossession was Newcastle 48% Brentford 52%\nTotal shots were Newcastle 21 Brentford 12\nShots on target were Newcastle 4 Brentford 3\nCorners were Newcastle 4 Brentford 5\nTouches in the box Newcastle 35 Brentford 37\nNewcastle team v Brentford:\nPope, Trippier (Krafth 89), Schar, Burn, Livramento, Joelinton, Tonali, Bruno, Barnes (Miley 98), Isak (Wilson 66), Murphy (Willock 66)\nUnused subs:\nDubravka, Shahar, Longstaff, Osula, Neave\n(Match Report – Either a celebration of all things Newcastle, or a crashing reality check… Read HERE)\n(Newcastle 2 Brentford 1 – Match ratings and comments on all the Newcastle United players – Read HERE)\n(Newcastle 2 Brentford 1 – Instant Newcastle United fan/writer reaction – Read HERE)\n(3 Positives and 3 Negatives to take from Newcastle 2 Brentford 1 – Read HERE)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
