  "body_text": "As Erik ten Hag addressed reporters in a media suite at the club’s Carrington training ground, he opted for the oldest trick in the book of any Manchester United manager: go after a man from Liverpool.\nSir Alex Ferguson was never shy in reminding the BBC how many former Liverpool pundits the national broadcaster had on its books. In 2012, Ferguson accused the ex-Liverpool defender Alan Hansen of criticising United publicly as a favour to his friend and then Liverpool boss Kenny Dalglish in a bid to rile United before a cup tie between the two clubs.\nAdvertisement\nEven last week, the new United part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe described Liverpool as “the enemy” and repeated Ferguson’s previous taunt, stating an ambition to knock Liverpool “from their perch”.\nYet on Tuesday, Ten Hag chose to criticise Jamie Carragher, the former Liverpool defender and now leading pundit on Sky Sports in the United Kingdom and on CBS Sports/Paramount+ in the United States. It followed a piercing segment of analysis on Sky’s Monday Night Football programme, in which Carragher identified flaws in Ten Hag’s setup during United’s 2-1 defeat by Fulham on Saturday afternoon at Old Trafford.\nCarragher presented clips from 20 seconds into United’s game against Fulham, highlighting huge swathes of space between the team’s midfield and defence.\nCarragher said: “Over the last few weeks, Manchester United have been in great form but still, the underlying numbers have been really poor.\n“They’ve been very fortunate, so we’re not talking about them now just because they lost to Fulham.\n“It’s about performances. They defend like a team I’ve never seen before. They like to press high with a deep block. It’s impossible. They like to do two things at the same time — you can only do one or the other.\n“We’re all pressing high or we’re all defending deep. They’re trying to do both.”\nIn response, Ten Hag took the bait. “Some analysts are very objective in their comments, very good advice, some are very subjective. Jamie Carragher, from the first moment on, he has criticised and now he wants to make his point.”\nUnsurprisingly, some of the more impulsive sections of the United fanbase online lapped up the Dutchman’s riposte. There is a part of every United fan that will immediately become defensive when a man from Liverpool underlines flaws in their rivals.\nTen Hag has previously been irritated by the speed at which Carragher cast doubt on the suitability of Lisandro Martinez for the Premier League, as the pundit questioned whether the player’s height (5ft 9in; 175cm) could see him exposed by the physicality of English football.\nYet while Carragher would never wish to see United thriving, his analysis on Monday appeared utterly objective, shorn of tribalism and backed up by the evidence of clips and overwhelming data. The only subjectivity at play in this episode may be Ten Hag’s unwillingness to see the weaknesses in a system that has been exposed all season long.\nAdvertisement\nTen Hag did acknowledge issues in the first half-hour against Fulham, arguing that the opposition’s midfield setup surprised him, but he then argued that United’s issues stemmed from a lack of “willingness, spirit and passion”.\nThis seemed a harsh charge to make against his players. The pattern of the match against Fulham has been consistent through a dismal campaign, with United eight points adrift of the top four in the Premier League. They were also knocked out of the Champions League and Carabao Cup before the turn of the year, but they will play Nottingham Forest in the fifth round of the FA Cup tonight.\nOn Saturday, Fulham registered 17 shots against United, following 22 for Luton Town, 23 for Aston Villa, 22 for West Ham United, 16 for Wolverhampton Wanderers, 17 for Newport County and 16 for Tottenham Hotspur in 2024 alone. And these underlying numbers have been recorded during United’s best run of form — in terms of results — in over a year.\nCarragher presented statistics to show that United have faced at least 16 shots in 14 games in the Premier League this season — the same as Sheffield United and Luton — while Arsenal (whose annual wage bill is £97m lower than United’s) have not once faced that many shots in a league game all season long and Manchester City have done so only twice.\nEven in matches from which United have emerged with credit — such as the 0-0 draw at Liverpool or 3-0 win at Everton — United have often ridden a storm, facing 34 shots at Anfield and 24 shots at Goodison Park.\nThe figures are clear not only in the Premier League but also in the Champions League, in which United faced 16 shots home and away against Copenhagen and 30 shots across two matches against Galatasaray. Ten Hag’s side finished bottom of their group.\nAs such, few United supporters will be fooled or distracted by Ten Hag’s attack on Carragher, nor will they buy the argument that United’s failures can be attributed to passion when the tactical failings appear so consistent.\nAdvertisement\nTen Hag is not the first manager to aim rather irrational criticism towards pundits. Jurgen Klopp once responded to Gary Neville’s criticism of his under-performing goalkeeper Loris Karius by saying “he is not interested in helping a Liverpool player”, while Pep Guardiola responded to negative analysis of his team’s performances this season by pointing out that Carragher had never won the Premier League.\nSuch responses, while petty and a little unreasonable, can be used as devices to stir a siege mentality within a sporting institution, which can be a valuable weapon in the pursuit of unity and success.\nAnd this may be all that Ten Hag is doing here. Yet it is hard to resist the view, increasingly, that Ten Hag is imagining enemies and bad faith where it does not exist. Take another answer on Tuesday, when the United manager suggested that he had received criticism for promoting the 18-year-old Kobbie Mainoo.\n“I brought in Kobbie Mainoo,” Ten Hag said. “Now, after six weeks, the same people who were questioning it are saying he has to go to the England squad.”\nIt was a strange comment, simply because it is difficult to recall anybody in any position of prominence questioning Ten Hag for introducing Mainoo, although the coach does deserve credit for recognising the midfielder’s potential during the club’s pre-season in the United States.\nTen Hag said the same about the progression of young winger Alejandro Garnacho, claiming that critics questioned: “What is the manager doing?”\nNone of these events matter in isolation but, collectively, they begin to build a picture of a man under pressure and eager to recover his public standing. By now, the arguments of this season are well-worn, with all manner of on-field issues, injuries, disciplinary processes and a takeover complicating United’s campaign, all of which conspires to make Ten Hag’s culpability debatable.\nAdvertisement\nAnd perhaps that is understandable when this season has been so disappointing and the new INEOS regime has stopped short of throwing its support behind the new manager. It probably does not make the manager any more comfortable that every press conference is now pockmarked by questions from the media enquiring about the nature of his conversations with Ratcliffe and the extent of the support he feels from the minority owner.\nDuring an interview with members of the media last week, Ratcliffe was careful in his words, acknowledging that other managers had failed in United’s poor sporting culture over the past decade, which may not have maximised a coach’s chance to succeed at Old Trafford. At the same time, however, he did not reel off a list of things about Ten Hag that INEOS had been impressed by.\nYet he did make clear that a distinct style of play was a priority and insisted Champions League qualification is crucial. As a shapeless United continue to exhibit the same blemishes, perhaps the precision of Carragher’s takedown on primetime television led Ten Hag to feel the ground shaking that little bit more violently beneath him.\n(Top photo: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
