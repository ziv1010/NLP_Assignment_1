  "body_text": "Andre Onana will need several more solid outings, clean sheets and a lot less dramas to convince supporters that Manchester United have found their long-term No.1.\nThe Cameroon international made eight saves and was generally top, or close to it, in most of the United player ratings after the 0-0 draw against Liverpool, at Anfield. He parried a couple of shots that he could have held on to but there were a couple of fine reaction stops in there.\nAhead of what was a daunting trip to league leaders Liverpool, Onana told Sky Sports. “We are not facing a good moment. I hope things will change as soon as possible.\n\"But listen, you want to tell me in six months the best goalkeeper in the Champions League last season can become the worst in the world? No. Everything is temporary. I know it'll be alright. If not today, it will be tomorrow, if not tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.\"\nFollowing the scoreless draw, in from of a record Premier League crowd at Anfield, a reporter cheekily told Onana 'there's sort of a myth about the atmosphere here'.\nAsked if he noticed anything different, Onana replied, \"Nothing. At Manchester United, you have to be ready for everything.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/RedMarrow_/status/1736642039822078182\nFans pile in on Andre Onana kicking\nWhile Andre Onana had eight saves to two from Alisson Becker, his opposite number, the distribution stats were more marked.\nAlisson had a 97% pass completion rate, attempting 37 and only giving away possession once. Onana attempted 43 passes and only found a teammate on 27 occasions [63% success rate]. Only Diogo Dalot was more sloppy in possession, for both sides.\nOn multiple occasions, including four times in the latter stages of the first half, Onana's kicks went straight out for Liverpool throw-ins, up the pitch. It led to a mix of football fans cribbing about his vaunted distribution skills, while others wondered if he was kicking the ball dead on purpose [almost like a rugby player would, to find touch].\nhttps://twitter.com/simoncoolston/status/1736657151962018089\nhttps://twitter.com/andykiko/status/1736441460684198334\nhttps://twitter.com/Eben_Ik/status/1736434811776995346\nhttps://twitter.com/Eojaa_/status/1736441004973068664\nhttps://twitter.com/M_v_Baron/status/1736441668146962564\nFor the most part, Andre Onana pinging kicks up-field and leaving Liverpool to their throw-ins was a safe enough option until near the end of the match.\nOnana rushed from his goal-line and the plan was definitely not to shank a clearance into the stands. He jogged back as Mo Salah took a quick throw-in, which almost led to a Luis Diaz goal.\nAll told, though, the record books will state the United goalkeeper kept his league-leading sixth clean sheet of a rollercoaster season.\nRelated links:\nHe could have left this one in the drafts Robert F Kennedy Jr has made a bizarre confession during an episode of the show This Past Weekend of podcaster Theo Von, as he talked about his drug use in the past.
