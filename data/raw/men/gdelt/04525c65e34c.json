They also state that ‘Juventus have already made their move’.\nThat mooted price tag does appear low though for an international player performing at the top of his game and still under contract at Newcastle for three more years.\nIndeed, any bid in the region of that figure could be met with short shrift, unless the player himself is genuinely pushing for an exit in the summer transfer window.\nDON’T MISS ➡️ When does the summer 2025 transfer window open? All the key dates…\nTindall raves over ‘exceptional’ Tonali\nTonali’s performance against Palace was the latest vindication of his talent after returning to action in August last year after a 10-month suspension from competitive football.\nAnd speaking after the midweek contest, stand-in boss Jason Tindall was left purring about the midfielder’s qualities in the middle of the park.\nHe told reporters: “He’s got so many great qualities, has Sandro. He’s exceptional on the ball whether it’s one-touch, two-touch, he always makes really, really good decisions, very, very quick, reads the game extremely well.\n“The midfield three at the minute have got a really good balance, they complement each other very well and I think everybody is starting to see that.”\nTonali has actually been pushed into more of a defensive midfield role this season, allowing the likes of Joelinton and Bruno Guimaraes to play further forward and have more impact on Newcastle’s attacking play.\nDespite playing deeper, the Italian has still managed to notch five goals and three assists in a campaign where the Magpies have celebrated their first major trophy in 70 years and are currently well placed to secure Champions League for next season.\nLatest Newcastle news\n⚫ Sources: Eddie Howe intervenes as Liverpool, Arsenal chase Newcastle superstar\n⚫ Liverpool plotting to shatter British transfer record with stunning striker swoop\n⚫ Ornstein confirms Arsenal interest in Newcastle ace – it’s not Isak",
