  "body_text": "Liverpool are working on plans to replace struggling manager Arne Slot after a disappointing season.\nHaving spent a massive amount on new signings last summer, Slot has struggled to keep the club competitive at the top level.\nSince October, Liverpool have struggled to keep up pace with Arsenal and Manchester City at the top of the Premier League standings.\nAlthough their performances have been impressive in the Champions League, they have failed to have the same impact in the Premier League.\nThe signings of Alexander Isak, Florian Wirtz and others have so far not completely lived up to expectations, possibly without the exception of Hugo Ekitike.\nLiverpool identify Alonso as managerial target\nAlthough nothing is decided at the moment, according to Fichajes, the Reds are interested in appointing Spanish manager Xabi Alonso as the next leader of the club.\nAlonso was recently sacked by Real Madrid and despite his tough spell in Spain, he is still highly rated for his impressive work with Bayer Leverkusen where he ended the dominance of Bayern Munich.\nThe young manager has earned plaudits for his playing style and tactics and the hierarchy at Liverpool have now made up their mind to target the former Liverpool midfielder.\nReds face competition from Premier League rivals Man City\nIt won’t be straightforward for the Reds though since Manchester City are expected to be in the race to appoint Alonso as Pep Guardiola’s successor.\nGuardiola’s future at the Etihad Stadium is uncertain and a report has claimed that he is on the shortlist of Man City to replace the legendary manager.\nFormer Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has praised Alonso in the past, calling him ‘exceptional‘.\nAlonso knows the club well, he knows the sentiments of the fans and the type of football they want to see at the club.\nHe would be the ideal replacement of Slot at the club and players at Anfield would respect him due to his past success at the club as a player.",
