  "body_text": "Eberechi Eze potential destinations - ranked\n- Eze has been linked with a move away from Crystal Palace\n- There's a £60m release clause in his contract\n- Assessing the England international's options\nEngland international and Crystal Palace star Eberechi Eze has been one of the most talked about Premier League players of the summer transfer window.\nAnd thanks to his incredible talent and the rather reasonable £60m release clause attached to his current deal at Selhurst Park, it's easy to see why.\nSo where should Eze go this summer?\nWe at 90min have taken a look and assessed his options...\n4. Tottenham Hotspur\nTottenham Hotspur fans have been crying out for their club to make a big-name signing this summer, and Eze would certainly fit that bill.\nAnd while Eze would thrive under an attacking manager like Ange Postecoglou, the lack of UEFA Champions League football on offer in north London may hurt the Lilywhites' chances of signing the England international.\nFit: 4/10\n3. Arsenal\nOne of the biggest problems Arsenal have had over the last few seasons is the lack of an alternative option to Bukayo Saka on the right flank.\nThat lack of options has led to Saka playing basically every game in the last three years, and led to some fans becoming concerned that the club may be running their 'Starboy' into the ground.\nThat's where Eze could come in.\nThe England international would alleviate the pressure on Saka on the right flank, slotting in when required. And he could even do the same for club captain Martin Odegaard in the attacking midfield role too.\nWould a rotation role be enough to entice Eze to the Emirates Stadium though? Potentially not.\nFit: 6/10\n2. Manchester City\nYep, another club at which Eze will be a rotation option.\nThe reason why Man City are placed higher in the ranking than Arsenal, however, is Pep Guardiola.\nOne would expect Guardiola, like he has done with a countless number of players throughout his career, to help Eze develop into the absolute best footballer he can be.\nThat fact, and the allure of plenty of silverware, make Man City one of Eze's better options this summer.\nFit: 8/10\n1. Liverpool\nThe reason why Liverpool are Eze's number potential destination this summer is very simple:\nLiverpool are the biggest club that Eze can go to and be a star player for.\nHe would slot seamlessly into the Reds starting XI, and provide Arne Slot's side with some much-needed goal threat from a central midfield position - something the team sorely lacked during the 2023/24 season.\nFit: 10/10",
