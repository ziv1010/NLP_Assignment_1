  "body_text": "It turns out right-backs are boring. So here's a sexier article to get the mouth watering instead.\nBy the way, I don’t for a moment think that we will buy a striker in January. Probably a slim chance that we would loan one. But the collective mood on ToffeeWeb is that a striker is what we need – so this is a case of giving the people what they want. These are the strikers I think could be vaguely available to us.\nThe acid test, though: might they score more than 12 goals in season one? I think there are only two who could do that – although others could achieve that (and more) in future seasons. And although that sounds disappointing, there is some serious talent listed here – and it is several notches above the sorts of players I'd have been listing out in recent years.\nBig fee and vaguely gettable\nAgahowa: The big 21-year-old Spaniard at Porto is a quality young striker with a Champions League career ahead of him. It was part of the sad fact of modern football that he was let go by Atletico Madrid for the favourable accounting treatment arising from the sale of youth products. He would probably cost £60M(+) and has 8 in 9 this season, albeit for a top club in a weak league. One of the two who might score more than 12 goals in season one with us.\nStrand-Larsen: The second-best big Norwegian in the Premier League. After a cracking 14 in 35 league games last season, he has 0 goals in 6 this season for struggling Wolves. He nearly joined Newcastle Utd in summer but they found the cash to sign Woltemade instead. Priced at £50M when touted for that Newcastle move. Now off the boil... Hard to gauge what level he’s really at.\nTalent\nCosta: Technically excellent 21-year-old Argentine at Genoa. Plays like a young Lautaro Martinez and looks destined for a Champions League career. Just 1 goal in 8 this season but… I think Costa is the biggest talent of all in this group of options. It’d be a big fee for potential though – perhaps even as high as £45M to £55m in today’s market.\nStassin: Technically gifted Belgian 20-year-old playing in the French second division for 90s indie pop band St Etienne. Tempted there for a €10M fee and the chance of meeting Sarah Cracknall (very obscure reference). 4 goals and 3 assists in 9 this season – but at a very mediocre level.\nAbline: Technically gifted French 22-year-old playing for Nantes in the French top-flight. Not having a big scoring season. No goals and 1 assist in 8 so far.\nBeier: Decent 23-year-old German striker at Dortmund, reduced to substitute appearances behind Guirassy and (ex-Wolves striker) Silva. Just 1 in 10 this season. Good technique, physique and pace... but limited track record as a goalscorer.\nBreakout season\nAsllani: Big 23-year-old German / Kosovan at Hoffenheim hitting good figures at the start of the season and now attracting unlikely links with Barcelona. 4 goals and 1 assist in 7 this season. But barely anything of note previously. Very hard to tell if he’s actually any good.\nEtta-Eyong: Powerful 22-year-old Cameroonian playing for Levante in Spain after leaving Villarreal in summer. Unlike our mate Barry, Etta-Eyong has banged in 5 goals and 3 assists in 9 so far this season. That was for just €3M. Did we buy the wrong Villarreal striker?\nKaua Elias: 19-year-old Brazilian playing for Shakhtar Donetsk after a €17M move in January. Previously wanted by Thelwell (along with links to about 50 clubs in Europe). Got 5 in 16 so far this season (all competitions). Could be good.\nAnsah: Towering 20-year-old German / Ghanaian at Union Berlin, with 4 goals and 1 assist in 7 this season.\nLoan in January\nEndrick: Short-arse 19-year-old Brazilian completely frozen out by Alonso at Real Madrid. Very gifted striker. Personally, I think he’d be entirely unsuited to our (lack of) style of play... but it would be fun to have him on loan.\nGimenez: Powerful 24-year-old Mexican who was banging them in at Feyenoord but has found life tricky in Serie A after a £30M(+) move to AC Milan. Has just 1 assist and 0 goals in 7 this season. They might be prepared to let him move on.\nWahi: Repeatedly linked 22-year-old French striker of very high technical ability and pace. After allegations of various unpleasant misdemeanours, he hasn’t quite got going again. He was bought by Frankfurt in readiness to fill the boots of Marmoush and Ekitike but it’s new signing Burkardt who has done that with Wahi consigned to the bench. If he could regain form, he could become outstanding. Like a French Mason Greenwood, he might have too much baggage despite the ability – and may even tarnish the name of the club.\nLoan (or even buy) in Summer 2026\nFerguson: I have it on good authority from Conor McCourt that he’s playing well for Roma despite the lack of goals. Personally, I think he’s a big talent and would be an excellent bit of recruitment for us. Still looking to get himself back on track from a goalscoring point of view though, hence he may be available.\nDelap: Due to Chelsea’s weird recruitment policy and uncertain managerial situation, I wouldn’t rule out the possibility of a loan for Delap next season. Alongside Agahowa, he’s the other who might score more than 12 goals in season one with us.\nDavid: A fairly short Canadian who looked like he would have been an excellent signing when banging them in for Gent when a youngster in Belgium. Shone at Lille and earned himself a move to Juventus on a free this summer. But hasn’t really worked out (1 goal in 8) since they also have Openda and Vlahovic.\nBy popular demand\nRicharlison: Without this man’s guts and determination, we could well be playing third-tier football and resolving administration issues. I’m not mad keen on the idea of going back, but who knows... Why not? If he’s available (especially on loan), then it could be like Ross and Rachel finally getting together in Friends with the spell at Spurs being “we were on a break”.\nNot a striker\nZirkzee: It could be a case of third time (at least) lucky with a player who we’ve been linked with since he was 16. Often described as a striker when he is, in fact, not a striker. He is a highly technical Number 10 – like, say, Cantona – and not suited to the Number 9 position at all (unless playing in a Klopp-style 4-3-3 where the goals, pace, and running in behind comes from the wing-forwards).\nReader Comments (42)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Brasil.\nWhy are we not able to pick up bargains like that?\n5 Posted 22/10/2025 at 21:52:30\nCharly Alcaraz is on the phone for you.\n6 Posted 23/10/2025 at 02:10:01\nA player I really like is Martin Terrier of Bayer Leverkusen. Excellent technique and can score and create. Primarily a winger but can play anywhere across the front line and also in the false 9 position.\nHe's 28 years old though, and has had some bad injuries the last few years, so probably never going to happen. But he'd be a serious upgrade to what we have and could replace Grealish when he goes back to Man City.\n7 Posted 23/10/2025 at 02:39:32\nHe's 28 years old and has 66 career goals at various levels beneath the Premier League.\nRobert,\nI'd go with Ferguson. I don't know why he suddenly fell out of favor at Brighton before being injured. But in his better times he reminds me of his namesake Dunc only without all the disorderliness. Remember Andy Gray? Had some rough years then became an icon? I think Ferguson has similar attributes.\n8 Posted 23/10/2025 at 07:04:11\nScored five in the tournament, including a hat-trick against Spain, after racking up 8 goals in qualifying. Played #10 in the tournament but he's tall, lightning quick and a natural finisher who will definitely move up top.\nAnd he's just starting his top-level pro career in Brazil, so still undiscovered.\n9 Posted 23/10/2025 at 07:12:55\nAll roads point to Ivan Toney at the moment. I'd imagine plenty of other teams are thinking the same thing though.\n10 Posted 23/10/2025 at 07:32:21\nKaio Jorge: now 23. Hit 15 in 25 after struggling as a teenager at Juve and various loans.\nVitor Roque: now 20. Hit 13 in 25 after struggling at Barca and Betis.\nOtherwise the Brazilian scorers chart is dominated by the very old or the very mediocre. Regularly linked Yuri Alberto has 7 in 19.\nThere are a handful of big striker talents as teenagers but none scoring more than 2 or 3.\nThe biggest scoring young talent is 19-year-old Rayan a fast powerful right-winger with 11 in 27. So not a striker.\nThe only vaguely interesting striker in Argentina is Veliz - who (age 22) has 5 in 11. But he is already with Spurs.\nAlong with European clubs, Saudi and the MLS take the best teenagers as soon as they emerge in South America now. You have to get them very young… and therefore not first team ready.\n11 Posted 23/10/2025 at 07:48:58\nIn terms of Toney, is there any suggestion at all that he's looking to return from Saudi? He's doing fine there and earning an astronomical amount of money too. I would have thought Al-Ahli would want their £40m back at least.\nAs with all of these players, you then have to ask if we are set up for him to score goals. At Brentford, the focus was on width and pace. Unfortunately these are the two things we are sorely lacking in. Until we remedy that, we will struggle to find a regular goalscorer (which is why I did the right-back article first).\n12 Posted 23/10/2025 at 09:01:21\nThe 'Needs-assembly and running in' talents, need time and patience, à la Barry, something we don't do.\nIf we had a couple of dependable veterans, 'Get me home' tyres if you like, we could have sent Barry on a 6-month or season's loan in the Championship to learn his craft.\nIt would of at least have helped if our one 'dependable veteran' could hit a barn door with a banjo this season.\n13 Posted 23/10/2025 at 12:55:19\nBarry gave up Champions League football to join us.\nIf we have money we can buy a striker. The biggest attraction for most players is money.\n14 Posted 23/10/2025 at 15:43:07\nI watched Monaco against Spurs yesterday and was quite impressed by Balogun, a USA player.\nPerhaps Mike Gaynes can give us a better opinion on him.\n15 Posted 23/10/2025 at 22:21:51\nI also agree that we need a better striker but is Beto's 1 in 8 as good as most of the above stats? I also keep saying that, although Beto has very limited ball control, we are playing to his strengths. Our play out from the back is way too slow.\nPlan A is to play Grealish, who has great ball control but holds up play, which allows defenders to set up. His options then are to play sideways to bring in Garner or Dewsbury-Hall in midfield or cross into a crowded area.\nOn the other side, when Jake goes forward, he invariably passes back inside to the same midfield. If you look at City's first goal on Saturday, we were backpedalling, so when the ball was crossed accurately, Haaland only had to hang back and pick his spot.\nFerguson has also been mentioned, I saw him recently against Armenia; while he did score the goal, he had other opportunities which I would have expected a good striker to put away. (Even Beto!)\n16 Posted 24/10/2025 at 07:05:13\nOnce our attacking play is in a good rhythm, with the glaring problems of (lack of) width and pace resolved, then our strikers (whoever they are) will start scoring. The same way Barry was scoring in a high-quality, competitive league last season -- for a well-structured Villarreal side.\nYou can't just swap in some currently in vogue forward into our current attacking play and get the same goals output. It would be very Everton to put together a deal to sign Toney only to find his goals dry up on arrival.\nIt is no coincidence that big scoring seasons (few as they are) for our strikers in the Premier League era coincide with an overall team with pace and width and creativity.\nI expect it will improve as the new players start to acclimatise and Moyes settles on a better shape. But it's obviously going to be a low-scoring season again.\n17 Posted 24/10/2025 at 07:20:54\n18 Posted 24/10/2025 at 07:54:55\nThe service to the strikers isn't great. Firing the ball at their head or into their body, when it's vs 2 centre-backs, is a tough battle.\nThis agricultural approach to attacking play has to go. If the tactic is fire it up there, and let them scrap for it, then Barry will struggle and Beto will lose a lot more than he wins.\nThe lack of a top-quality right-winger for the here and now remains a problem. Our most creative player is wasted out there, and Dibling is miles off it. I was against that buy, as it presented more problems than it solved with a big price tag.\nI've question marks over both current full-backs, right-wing, and Number 10, and then most of the rest of the side is the wrong side of 30.\nIt perhaps highlights it is a side in transition, and it'll take more than one transfer window.\n19 Posted 24/10/2025 at 08:38:40\nIf we were looking to save money, then for me the question mark is over the signing of both Dewsbury-Hall and Alcaraz for circa £40M. We only needed one of them.\nIf we'd bought a proper right-back instead of Dewsbury-Hall, then I expect Moyes might be more comfortable having a talented rookie at right-wing.\nWe also don't know whether Grealish will be with us beyond this season, so Dibling offers us a similar player long term.\n20 Posted 24/10/2025 at 08:53:26\nTo be fair, Rangers are a total shit-show at the moment, everybody's struggling there.\n21 Posted 24/10/2025 at 08:54:06\nI did notice an error in my post which meant to say we were not playing to Beto's strengths -- nor, as you pointed out, any other striker either.\nI don't know enough to be able to solve it. That's what managers are for, namely to get the best out of the resources which are available to them.\nMoyes did that very well when he came in a replace Dyche. He is doing reasonably well at the moment but I do believe there is a better performing side in there somewhere if he can find the right mix that works for in attack and defence.\nMoyes's default is to make sure we are strong defensively, which he does well again given the players he has available. It is the middle third of the field where he has all the options.\nFor example, I thought Alcaraz was overrated, yet when he came on against Palace, he changed the game. His first instinct is the move forward at pace, which also suits Beto, but if we lose the ball, we are totally exposed at the back.\nDewsbury-Hall covers acres of space and is very good on the press but I'm not sure he has the same creativity as Alcaraz. Hence that's why I think Moyes prefers Dewsbury-Hall.\nAlso, Alcaraz didn't do himself any favours when he was selected against Wolves. Just one of the dilemmas.\nOthers include what to do with Iroegbunam, Dibling, Röhl -- not only as to how to get the best of their undoubted talents but how to find a combination where they fit in a team. We tend to always look and blame the individual but a team is based on the sum of the performance of all its players.\nI once heard a very successful manager say that in their post-match analysis that each aspect of play was analysed, down to where a player may have made an intercepted pass. The focus of the analysis was not on blaming the player but to focus on what part of our coaching failed to guide the player to the correct decision.\nOver to you David Moyes to find the correct combinations of the players available to get the best out of the side and to put pressure to find alternatives in January to complete the jigsaw.\n22 Posted 24/10/2025 at 08:57:38\nWere joint 10th in terms of these “big chances” created.\nHere’s the snippet on us:\n“ Everton have shown marginal improvement in big-chance conversion. Having recorded a rate of 25 per cent in the first eight matches of three consecutive seasons, they have begun 2025-26 at 33 per cent.\nFive of their 15 total chances came against Crystal Palace, and they converted two to get their biggest result of the season. They also finished two of three in the 3-2 win over Wolves. Everton did not create a single big chance against Liverpool and West Ham, while they frustratingly spurned three in the 0-0 draw with Villa.\nJames Garner and summer arrivals Jack Grealish and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall lead the team, with three big chances created each. Iliman Ndiaye has scored all three of his big chances but his success is offset by Beto and Thierno Barry converting just one of their combined six.\nThis miss by Beto against Manchester City was worth 0.84 xG, making it the third-worst miss after Haaland against Manchester United (0.93xG) and Ismaila Sarr against Villa (0.91xG).“\nWhole article here:\n23 Posted 24/10/2025 at 10:23:37\n1) If we are not scoring goals, that does not solely fall as the responsibility of the striker. Neither of our strikers have had as many chances presented to them as the likes of Haaland (obviously) or Mateta, Welbeck, Gyökeres, Woltemade, Sesko etc. We are not creating enough good chances. Though I do think Beto should be on 2-3 goals rather than the 1.\n2) There is a real dearth of viable strikers who would come to us and do significantly better.\nIn terms of your list, rather than Costa at Genoa (who I don't think exists?) I assume you mean Castro at Bologna who looks a talent but has a similar return to Beto this season.\nAgahowa is a talent but wouldn't be cheap and would probably have better offers and the same is probably true of Strand-Larsen.\nMost of the others on the list would be in the same category as Barry: good young players who would probably take time to adjust to the Premier League.\nEvan Ferguson is yet to find the net in 400 or so minutes for Roma despite playing well. Perhaps he is an option in the summer but I imagine he'll stay at Roma this season.\nThe reality is that we bought our promising young striker who managed more last season than most on this list. We have to give him time to adapt and flourish.\n24 Posted 24/10/2025 at 13:04:16\nSargeant (Norwich), Thomas Asante (Coventry) to name two. Lawrence Shankland (Hearts) another.\nWe have bought too many foreign strikers who have never done well, besides Lukaku and say Jelavic.\n25 Posted 24/10/2025 at 14:02:15\nI am very pleased to champion Championship players and Scots too. However, the ones you mention are rubbish.\nWe'd need to be relegated twice before Shankland was a sensible option.\n26 Posted 24/10/2025 at 14:30:11\nComparatively expensive, and offering nothing. It did mention it's a tough time to come in there but apparently some of his misses have been lacking in both technique and conviction. Meanwhile, apparently behind the scenes, Thelwell is still championing him as a future star.\nIt just illustrates that it is difficult to predict how a player will fare. Especially a young or inexperienced one, and that is before you factor in injuries -- of which he has had a few.\n27 Posted 24/10/2025 at 15:00:34\nNot a word about Victor Osimhen?\nWhat think yee of him?\n28 Posted 24/10/2025 at 15:39:51\nKone at QPR might be the best option and he's only just made the step up. Ivanovic at Milwall seems to have struggled so far this season.\n29 Posted 24/10/2025 at 16:37:12\nVictor Osimhen moved to Galatasaray less than 3 months ago for €75M. A very good striker. But won't be joining Everton any time soon, so I didn't include him in my list.\nSam # 23, yes, I got my Castro mixed up with a (imaginary?) Costa!\n30 Posted 24/10/2025 at 17:29:53\nA team that has no right-back or established right-winger seems to be a bigger issue. The money was there, so it wasn't as if it was a choice of one or other, they just couldn't get deals done.\nDibling is very much for tomorrow, but the team is crying out for delivery on the right now. My fear remains that we don't have the patience to wait for him to deliver.\nWe were goal shy last season, and still lack players that will get more than 5 -- and probably way off double figures. I can only see Ndiaye getting there, and that's probably with some penalties.\n31 Posted 24/10/2025 at 17:33:52\nI promoted Balogun here a while back after he established himself as the most talented striker the USA has ever had (admittedly a low bar to clear). Glad we didn't go for him then as he then went down for almost a year with an injury.\nHe's the full package of quality in a forward but staying healthy is a problem. Assuming he's in one piece, he will definitely start up top for the USA next summer.\n32 Posted 24/10/2025 at 17:59:33\nHe looked quite threatening against Spurs the other night but, like all strikers, you need to assess them over a longer period.\n33 Posted 24/10/2025 at 20:17:34\nAlthough I like both players, buying both robbed us of the money to buy a right-back, and it's hurting our style of play badly.\nIf it's not fixed in January, it will be a difficult low-scoring season.\nMike: it's been a while since Balogun had his one good scoring season at Reims. Do you really think he's still good? I left both him and Pepi out …\n34 Posted 24/10/2025 at 21:23:46\nBig, powerful, strong centre-forward. Looks like he can head the ball.\n35 Posted 24/10/2025 at 21:54:11\nDewsbury-Hall has the ability to play at Number 10, centre-mid, left-wing, and I'd say left-wingback, whilst he's played 82 games in defensive midfield (per TransferMarkt). That to me demonstrates fair versatility when we are light in midfield.\n36 Posted 24/10/2025 at 22:46:23\nIt's interesting that many signings in the summer for many Premier League clubs have not hit the ground running, so to speak.\n37 Posted 24/10/2025 at 22:50:38\nHowever, our main creative sources, Ndiaye and Grealish, spend a hell of a lot of time faffing about, trying to beat as many players as they can, so that, by the time they do release the ball, whichever striker plays is, unsuitably for them, in the middle of a crowded penalty area.\nnb: This is not in any way a criticism of our creative players -- two of the most exciting players we've had in the last 20 years, but a call for a change in how the wide men interact with our strikers.\n38 Posted 25/10/2025 at 08:12:31\nIt is a sad fact that -- quality though Grealish obviously is -- we might have been better off bringing in a very fast wing-forward to create width, stretch the play, and speed up the delivery of the ball to our strikers.\nAt the moment, we have no-one in the squad capable of performing this role. Maybe we need a poor man's Doku to supply our poor man's Haaland (Barry)?\n39 Posted 25/10/2025 at 10:55:01\nI think Ivan Toney has the quality and confidence to score in our current set up, so don't see that as a problem. As for your other question, no I don't think there is much suggestion that he wants to come back other than a natural assumption that surely he doesn't want to waste the final peak years of his career playing at such a low level.\nI'm certainly not the only one making that assumption, as there's all kinds of speculation out there, but nothing credible or claiming to be linked to the player himself.\nI still think our current strikers would be scoring more if we set up more positively with Garner at right back, Dewsbury-Hall deeper and Alcaraz at ten. Moyes is Moyes and will always take the cautious option, meaning that any striker will struggle for long periods.\n40 Posted 25/10/2025 at 11:19:54\nTo be honest, though, I am not sure Saudi is that low a level.\nI would have thought Toney's present club Al Ahli (managed by Inzaghi) would certainly give us a run for our money - with players like Mendy (ex Chelsea GK), Demiral (ex Juve CB), Kessie (ex AC Milan CM), Millot (ex Stuttgart ACM), Mahrez (ex City) etc etc. And Al Ahli are only a mid-table club.\nSaudi is not just a retirement home - it is now a career choice for players in their prime and young and upwardly mobile players from across Europe and South America.\nToney is rubbing shoulders with some very, very good players out in Saudi.\n41 Posted 25/10/2025 at 14:02:35\nMoyes was given the opportunity to divulge his feelings in his presser with the reporter phrasing a question about Jimmy's and Jake's flexibility and how important that is in light of Jarrad's injury.\nShe was essentially asking \"Are we likely to see Garner at right-back and Jake centrally?\" -- in a more subtle and encouraging way without getting the fallback.\nThe manager was stoic in his response that Jake will be the right-back for the foreseeable with Tarkowski's role not up for debate. Keane only was an afterthought, whom he had to nearly correct himself after almost forgetting, getting tied up by the questioner framing it about the versatility of Garner and O'Brien.\nYou view this as oversight and proffered that it will take another round of spending for us to be able to push up and play like a 'big team'. I would bet that, if Moyes oversees another 3 windows before his contract ends, you would still see the name Tarkowski in his last team sheet.\nUnfortunately, I think you are looking at summer time before we get the overlapping full-back and pacey winger you crave.\nGreat thread this, by the way, a bit like ToffeeWeb of old, with some excellent contributions from Pete and Neil.\n42 Posted 25/10/2025 at 21:03:20\nDoes that mean Moyes wouldn't have liked a quality right-back? No. In the same way, I am pretty sure he'd have liked Ekitike and / or Isak (instead of Barry), I am pretty sure he'd have been pleased to sign the likes of Frimpong, Mukiele, or even Tchatchoua and Kayode as a new right-back. But what can you do when the budget runs out?\nIt may well be summer 2026 before we sort out some of the glaring issues with the squad -- by which time we might (who knows) have seen the last of Grealish in an Everton shirt.\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
