  "body_text": "Liverpool\nPremier League • England\nMo Salah agent responds in no uncertain terms to Liverpool summer exit reports\nThe agent of Liverpool forward Mo Salah has responded to fresh reports that the Anfield favourite will quit the club if they miss out on Champions League qualification this season.\nJurgen Klopp’s men are having a season to forget, both domestically and now in Europe after their Champions League humbling against Real Madrid on Merseyside last week.\nThe Reds face an exit from Europe’s premier cup competition after being beaten 5-2 in the first leg of their last-16 clash, having led 2-0 early in the game.\nThat, coupled with them crashing out of both domestic cups and sitting seventh in the Premier League table, leaves Klopp already starting to plan for next season – with Champions League football very much in doubt.\nLiverpool are currently nine points behind fourth-placed Tottenham, although they do have two games in hand so finishing top four is not out of the question.\nHowever, a report from Spanish publication Fichajes claimed on Monday that Salah will quit in the summer if the Reds are not dining at Europe’s top table.\nThe Egypt international only signed a new contract with the club last summer. That deal runs until 2025, but it’s not stopped rumours of the talismanic forward moving on.\nSalah agent shoots down exit talk\nThe player’s agent, however, has seemingly put an end to those rumours on Twitter.\nRamy Abbas Issa tweeted, when replying to the report: “Nonsense. This was never discussed or thought about. Not qualifying to the Champions League hasn’t even crossed our minds.”\nSalah‘s form this season has largely mirrored Liverpool’s troubles. Indeed, the forward has scored just twice in his last 10 Premier League outings.\nThe Reds are back in Premier League action on Wednesday evening when they host Wolves in the Premier League.\nVictory will see them move above Fulham into sixth on goal difference. However, they will have to show much more cutting edge than they did in the 0-0 draw with Crystal Palace over the weekend.",
