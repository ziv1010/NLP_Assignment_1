  "body_text": "President Andrea Langella of Juve Stabia and Daniel McClory, Executive Chairman of Brera Holdings PLC, announcing the partnership in Naples on December 9, 2024\nDublin, Ireland and Milan, Italy, Dec. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brera Holdings PLC (\"Brera Holdings\") (NASDAQ:BREA), an Ireland-based, Nasdaq-listed, international holding company focused on expanding its global portfolio of men's and women's sports clubs through a multi-club ownership (\"MCO\") approach, today announced the details of its three-step acquisition process that will result in the acquisition of a majority equity ownership interest in Italian Serie B football club SS Juve Stabia SpA (\"Juve Stabia\" or \"the Club\").\nBrera Holdings previously announced the signing of a binding term sheet for the Juve Stabia acquisition at a press conference in Naples on December 9, 2024, and it marks a significant expansion of the Company's MCO model, strategically designed to drive operational synergies, enhance shareholder value, and unlock long-term growth opportunities.\nJuve Stabia, an historic Serie B football club celebrating 117 years of tradition, now known as \"The Second Team of Naples,\" continues to showcase its competitive strength, highlighted by last weekend's 1-0 victory against Cesena FC. Juve Stabia now sits alone in fourth place in the Serie B table, with 28 points and 2 points over fifth-ranked US Cremonese – just behind Sassuolo, Spezia, and Pisa. The top three Serie B teams are promoted to Serie A at the end of the season, with the first two automatic qualifiers, and the third is determined by a playoff among teams finishing the season standings ranked three through six.\nKey Highlights of the Acquisition Process:\nStrategic Rationale for the Acquisition\nBrera's acquisition of Juve Stabia underscores its commitment to scaling its MCO model, which targets achieving potential operational efficiencies, cost synergies, and streamlined talent development across its portfolio. By integrating Juve Stabia into this model, Brera strengthens its ability to enhance revenue growth and create long-term value for shareholders.\nLooking Ahead\nAs Brera Holdings progresses through the Juve Stabia acquisition timeline, Mr. McClory said the Company remains committed to supporting the Club's ambitions on and off the field. With a focus on scalable operations and strategic partnerships, we believe Brera is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the global football market.\nABOUT BRERA HOLDINGS PLC\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCompany Contact Information:\nDan McClory, Executive Chairman, Brera Holdings PLC\nEmail: [email protected]\nAttachment\n© 2026 Benzinga.com.
