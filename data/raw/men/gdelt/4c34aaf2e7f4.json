  "body_text": "Alan Shearer has provided us with his latest round of Premier League predictions heading into another packed weekend of action.\nArsenal are seven points clear at the summit and host a Manchester United side once again showing signs of life under Michael Carrick on Sunday afternoon.\nBefore then, Burnley can pile the pressure right back on Thomas Frank when they host Tottenham on Saturday with Liverpool on the road at Bournemouth.\nNewcastle United and Aston Villa meet in what could be a thriller at St James’ Park while Crystal Palace will hope to end a thoroughly miserable week on a high at home to Chelsea.\nAs ever, England legend and Betfair ambassador Alan Shearer has revealed his Premier League predictions to Metro.\nWest Ham United vs Sunderland\nI obviously criticised West Ham heavily for their defeat at Wolves, but everything that was missing in that game came out in the performance at Spurs. They played on the front foot, were confident, and at least had a go, a fight, and a scrap. All those things you need. It was much better, and they deserved their victory, albeit in the last minute.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nSunderland won last time out, but they are away from home this time. They’ve proven this season that anyone going head-to-head with them has to play well to beat them.\nPrediction: Draw\nBurnley vs Tottenham Hotspur\nI know Spurs won in the Champions League this week, and Dominic Solanke getting his goal will do him the world of good, despite their poor home form.\nTheir away form is different; I guess the shackles are off when they travel. Burnley haven’t been very good, despite the point at Liverpool. Just for the sake of Tottenham being away from home, where they seem more comfortable, I’m not with any huge confidence, but I will say Spurs.\nPrediction: Tottenham win\nFulham vs Brighton\nIt is difficult to predict Brighton. Because of the standards they’ve set over the years, you maybe view them differently, but I had them somewhere around mid-table, and that’s where they’ll end up. We know what their model is. This is another tough one to predict, but I’m going to go with Fulham.\nPrediction: Fulham win\nMan City vs Wolves\nI know Man City have been in a rut, and the last two performances have been unacceptable. But they’re back at home against the bottom club. I know Wolves have found a bit of form they are unbeaten in four and took a point off Newcastle – but I can’t go against Man City at home against the bottom club.\nWe have said before that “if you want a game, you want Wolves,” but it is a slightly different Wolves now with the improvement over the last four games. However, I still think City have too much for them at home, and I wouldn’t be surprised if Haaland got back on the scoresheet with a couple or more.\nPrediction: Man City win\nBournemouth vs Liverpool\nBournemouth is a tough place to go. Liverpool are unbeaten in 13 now, but we don’t know what to expect from them. If the Liverpool that played at Marseille turn up, then they’ll win the points, but that hasn’t always been the case in the league. Because of that uncertainty and them playing away from home, I’m going to sit on the fence.\nPrediction: Draw\nBrentford vs Nottingham Forest\nBrentford were unlucky against Chelsea; they had three or four really big chances and missed them. They are back at home, and even though there was a mix-up with the fixtures, I’m sticking with them. Because of how they are playing and the chances they are creating, I think they’ll make it very difficult.\nForest are in a relegation battle, there’s no doubt about it. I think the three who are in the relegation zone will go down.\nPrediction: Brentford win\nCrystal Palace vs Chelsea\nChelsea are winning, which is a positive, but they haven’t really been that impressive performance-wise.\nThere is probably no better time to play Crystal Palace than right now, with all the turmoil regarding the manager and players leaving or wanting to leave. Just because of that situation with Palace, I’ll back Chelsea.\nIt’s too early to tell with Liam Rosenior, he’s played in every competition and he’s had a good start in terms of results.\nPrediction: Chelsea win\nNewcastle United vs Aston Villa\nBruno Guimarães going off injured for Newcastle is a worry depending on how bad it is, but Newcastle’s home form has been superb. I wouldn’t go against anyone with Newcastle at St James’ Park; it’s been very different to their away form. For that reason, I’m backing them.\nPrediction: Newcastle win\nArsenal vs Manchester United\nWe know the way United are going to play. They will want Arsenal to attack them so they can hit them on the break, a classic example was the Mbeumo goal last week against City.\nHowever, I was in Milan on Tuesday watching Arsenal; Arteta made six or seven changes to the team that played Forest, and they were still very impressive. They also don’t have to worry about Europe next Wednesday because they are guaranteed first or second, so they can play their strongest team without distraction.\nMore Trending\nDespite what we saw from Man United last week, I think Arsenal will edge it. It’ll be a really tough game, likely decided by one goal.\nPrediction: Arsenal win\nEverton vs Leeds United\nWhat a result for Everton last week at Villa; not many thought they could go there and win. But I’ve been impressed with Leeds, just their attitude and how the manager has them playing. I think they’ll go to Goodison Park and get something.\nPrediction: Draw\nMORE: ‘He was interested’ – Ruben Amorim wanted Man Utd to sign £35m star this month before sacking\nMORE: Michael Carrick reveals Man Utd star has ‘impressed’ him ahead of Arsenal clash\nMORE: Viktor Gyokeres replacement? Arsenal make contact over move for £82m superstar",
