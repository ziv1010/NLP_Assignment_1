Goals were hard to come by in his first three seasons with the Athens-based side, netting four, four and seven in the league in those campaigns.\nNevertheless, his form was good enough to see him win the first of his 11 full caps - two goals - in 2022, having already played at U18, U19 and U21 levels.\nLast season, however, Ioannidis, whose father Vasilios also played professionally in Greece, netted 23 times and picked up nine assists in all competitions, 15 in the league, seven in Europe, Panathinaikos having narrowly missed out on the group stage of the Champions League before entering the Europa League.\nThat led to interest from clubs abroad including Sporting and Girona in Spain, while Ioannidis is reported to have turned down interest from French side Lille.\nIf Town were to land Ioannidis, the striker’s fee would be the biggest in the club’s history, with the £4.8 million paid to Sampdoria for keeper Matteo Sereni in the summer of 2001 still the club record. Ioannidis would also be the first player signed from an overseas club since the takeover.\nMeanwhile, the Blues continue to be linked with Tottenham centre-half Joe Rodon, who spent last season on loan with Leeds United.\nThe Whites are keen to sign the Wales international permanently, but Football.London reports that Town are among the other suitors along with fellow promoted sides Leicester and Southampton.\nSwansea-born Rodon came through the ranks at his hometown club, spending time on loan at Cheltenham while with the Swans.\nThe ball-playing centre-half’s form with the Welsh club in the Championship led to Spurs signing him for £11 million in October 2020 on a five-year deal which is up next summer.\nSince then, he has made 14 starts and 10 sub appearances for Tottenham and has spent spells on loan at Rennes and then last season Leeds, where he made 49 starts and one sub appearance as the Whites missed out on promotion in the play-offs.\nElsewhere, former Town loanee Jeremy Sarmiento says he's yet to have discussions regarding his future with parent club Brighton.\n“I have pre-season to do, where I'll go back with Brighton. Then we'll see what happens,” the 22-year-old said having scored on his birthday for Ecuador in their 2-1 victory over Honduras yesterday, his first international goal.\nWhen Sarmiento joined the Blues on loan in January, it was understood that the deal included the potential for the forward to return to Portman Road this summer.\nMeanwhile, former Town loanee Callum Connolly joined League Two champions Stockport County over the weekend after leaving Blackpool.\nThe 26-year-old was with the Blues in 2017/18, making 30 starts and five sub appearances, scoring four times.\nPhoto: Sipa USA\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\nAdd him to our squad and we’ll only get feta and feta.\nIf this link and fee is true this is certainly an insight into the transfer policy we’re adopting and makes me more hopeful they might be willing to splash the cash on Omari as long as we can fend off the interest from Champions League football at Stuttgart.\nIf the first player we are linked with is 22m Euros i thinks it's fair to say we will mush more than most to spend. We won't be in Man City's league signing players at 80m plus each, but i expect us to recruit heavily and it would not surprise me if we spent 80-100m in total\nApparently a move to Sporting Lisbon is already nearly a done deal though\nDefence and goalkeeper should be out signing priorities.\n'Bobble' have you not had therapy yet mate? How can you make such ridiculous comments?\nI'm sure McK is far beyond what we mortals think in regards to strengthening the side anyway...\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
