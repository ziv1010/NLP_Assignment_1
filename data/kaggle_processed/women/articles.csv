6,'We know how good we are' - Will Sweden end England's Women's Euros hopes?,"Magdalena Eriksson, the Sweden defender and Chelsea captain, was speaking to the press about her nation’s Women’s Euro semi-final opponent, England. Next to her was Kosovare Asllani – the team’s No.9 by shirt, but No.10 by nature. “They’ve looked stable and worked well defensively,” Eriksson said before glancing at her team-mate with a smile. “But maybe Kosovare can open it up a little bit. You never know.” Before all the talk of ‘It’s coming home’, Sweden was the nation tipped by many to win this Euros. Last summer, they were outstanding at the Olympics Games, losing only on penalties in the final. In 2019, they reached the last four of the World Cup, eliminated in extra-time before beating England to third place. After constant improvement through each experience, they occupied a large amount of the pre-tournament talk – and rightly so. This is a balanced, consistent and well-coached team. It has all the ingredients to win the title. “We know how good we are,” Fridolina Rolfo, the Barcelona star, said when asked by GOAL about that hype. “We know what it feels like to lose games and we know we don't want to have that feeling again. But also, we are even better now. “We have a really good defence. We have many fast players, so we can use counterattacks to score goals. We are strong on set-pieces, too.  ""Maybe we have more technical players now [compared to last summer] – skilful, with fast movement. I think perhaps that is something we have added to the squad.” They are yet to set the Euros alight but got better with each game in the group stages, sealing top spot ahead of the reigning champions, the Netherlands, with a 5-0 win over Portugal. That set-up a quarter-final tie with Belgium that many expected them to cruise through, but their opponents were tough and while England fans watching the eventual 1-0 win may have concluded there was nothing for the Lionesses to worry about, there was important context to note. In the build-up to the game, Sweden lost Hanna Glas and Emma Kullberg to Covid-19, with Jonna Andersson another confirmed case on the day. The former and the latter are their two first-choice full-backs and their absences were felt massively, with the team struggling for joy out wide. It was Linda Sembrant’s stoppage-time winner that secured passage to the semi-finals. The 35-year-old only played nine league games all season due to injury, but she came up big on her first start of the summer. “Holding a clean sheet with a newly-composed backline, with players who haven’t played a lot in this tournament, who haven’t had the best way to prepare, like Linda who has been injured – I’m really, really impressed with how those players stepped up,” Eriksson said after. It summed up a real strength of Sweden's – depth.  It was on show in the group stages, too, particularly when Hanna Bennison, the 19-year-old named GOAL’s NXGN winner last year, came off the bench to score a late winner against Switzerland that would help secure first place. It was her first international goal. #NXGN 2021 winner Hanna Bennison with a stunning winner for Sweden at #EURO2022 https://t.co/3jsg9Nrsck That squad strength has been needed with the Covid cases and an injury to captain Caroline Seger, who holds things together in midfield. In addition, star striker Stina Blackstenius started the tournament with a knock. The unity of the group is important in that sense, too. “[We’re] a team that will do everything [we] can to win a game,” Eriksson added. “We never give up, we always fight, we run for each other, we work really, really hard.” Sweden will be facing a stronger team than Belgium this time, but the general consensus among the players is that it will be a game that suits them more. While their quarter-final opponents sat deep and defended in a block, England will want to dominate. “It will be a totally different game. I think they will attack and be more offensive and I think that's good for us,” Johanna Rytting Kaneryd, the winger who has formed a potent partnership on the right with Glas, who will return for the semi-final, told GOAL. Gerhardsson has options with pace, quick feet and good decision-making. He also has one of the stand-out playmakers on the planet, in Asllani, who has been one of the best players in England this summer. They will have to defend more and nullify the incredibly dangerous and talented players the hosts have, too, but, as Rolfo says, that’s one thing this team excels at. They also have the ability to press high, which England did not enjoy against Austria in their opening fixture. ""Stina Blackstenius is one of our best defenders,” Gerhardsson explained. “She’s tactically very clever and works very hard. I have clips from the Olympics where she chases four or five players and wins the ball. “Kosovare Asllani is also one of our best. She has such good awareness of the game play. She’s incredibly good in the defensive work. They’re very good in a high press."" ‘Even against England?’ one journalist asked. ""Even against the United States in the Olympics,” Gerhardsson responded. “Even against England in the World Cup in 2019."" After coming so close to glory in recent years, Sweden are hungry. There has been so much talk about them, but on Tuesday, the pressure will be off.  It’ll all move onto the team on the other side of the pitch, who will be buoyed by a vocal home crowd – but an expectant one. England know they’ve been good. They know they have what it takes to finally turn a major tournament semi-final – their fourth in a row – into a final. But their opponent is certainly capable of stopping them. “We want to win the tournament,” said Rolfo. “But we know we have to work.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/women-euros-sweden-england-semi-final/bltae7d25f645c9ac5e,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
30,"CONCACAF Women's Championship 2022: USWNT & Mexico fixture schedule, TV channels & rosters","The 11th edition of the CONCACAF W Championship took place this summer, serving as qualifiers for both the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup and the 2024 Summer Olympic Games. The tournament was last held back in 2018, when the United States lifted its eighth title by beating Canada 2-0 in the final. In the end, the U.S. secured their place atop CONCACAF once again by taking down Canada, sealing a 1-0 win in the tournament finale The 2022 edition of the CONCACAF W Championship was held in Mexico, with all matches played in the Monterrey region of the country. Two venues were chosen to host the 16 games that will be played. One is the Estadio BBVA in Guadalupe, which has been home to Monterrey since it opened in 2015 and has a capacity of 53,500. The other is Estadio Universitario, the home venue of Tigres which can welcome up to 41,615 fans. Despite hosting the tournament, Mexico still had to go through the qualifying process and were one of the six teams to secure its place by winning its respective qualifying group. The United States and Canada both were granted automatic qualification to the tournament, while the other participating nations finished the qualifying process on April 12. The qualified nations are below. The group stage draw for the tournament was completed on April 19, following the confirmation of the eight qualified nations. The teams that finished in the top two in the group stages qualified for the Women's World Cup and advanced to the knockout stage of the CONCACAF W Championship. The two teams that finish third in the group stages will progress to the inter-continental play-off stage of World Cup qualifying. Only the winner of this tournament, the U.S., automatically secured its place at the 2024 Olympics Games. There will be one other CONCACAF representative in France that summer, and that will be determined by a play-off between Jamaica and Canada.

32,The incredible story of Alex Popp: Germany's record-breaking Women's Euros debutante,"As the ball hit the back of the net for Germany’s fourth goal against Denmark, Alexandra Popp looked for a split-second like she was about to wheel away in celebration. But then the emotion hit her. She sank to her knees, her head hit the grass and she smacked the ground repeatedly as her team-mates swarmed and congratulated her. This wasn’t just a cherry-on-the-cake goal for Germany, as they swept aside the 2017 Women’s Euros runners-up in their opening fixture of this summer’s edition. It was Popp’s debut in this competition and she’d marked it with her first goal – at 31 years old. Since then, she’s scored five more times, becoming the first player ever to score in five successive Women’s Euro games. On Wednesday night, her brace sent Germany into the 2022 final, helping them to overcome France by a 2-1 scoreline. A three-time Champions League winner and a footballer widely – and rightly – recognised as one of Germany’s best, her record-breaking run and chance to finally shine on this stage has been one of the stories of the summer. Since making her senior international debut in 2010, Popp has twice been cruelly denied the chance to represent her country at a Euros. In 2013, fresh off the back of her second European club title, it was an ankle injury that stopped her being part of the Germany team that won its eighth trophy on the continent. Four years later, a knee injury was the problem. In fact, had this summer’s tournament not been delayed a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, she’d have missed it again due to another terrible knee injury, this one sidelining her for 11 months. The way she is playing in England, you can see the positive impact of those negative experiences – the enjoyment, the value she is placing on every moment. “It means a lot to me [to be here], I have to admit,” she explained on Wednesday evening. “You saw it on the first goal but also in the other games – I am more emotional than I used to be because I know how I have arrived at this point. “Being here, having this opportunity to perform like this, being fully fit at this stage, that makes me very proud, but I also have to say a big thanks to everyone who has been there with me. “The medical staff who have always motivated me in the rehab. My coaches at my club and the national club, they kept believing in me and gave me the opportunity to get to where I had to be to be here.  ""That makes me extremely proud and I'm very happy that I'm allowed to play here and that we've reached the final. “It’s an incredible story and I hope we will have a very nice happy ending.” It’s been six years since Germany won a major title – Olympic gold at Rio 2016. For a team as well-decorated as this one, both historically as a national team but also given the individuals in the squad who are used to winning trophies, that’s a long, long time. Thanks to Popp, though, they are one step closer. Alex Popp this tournament 🔥 #WEURO2022 pic.twitter.com/yMDT7e2l9b It’s not just her goals that have played a huge role in the road to Wembley. As captain of this side, she leads in many ways. One of those is in her performances on the pitch. Another is in her personality as a winner and a motivator. But her experience and how she deals with situations in a game is crucial too. “We need their experience and their calmness when there are obstacles,” Martin Voss-Tecklenburg, Germany’s head coach, explained when asked about the importance of the older players in her squad, such as Popp. Her comments came after her striker had spent the first 10 minutes of the post-match press conference taking questions, before heading off to celebrate with her team. Voss-Tecklenburg spent that time smiling at Popp and nodding as she batted away questions about her records, the Golden Boot race – which she is now joint-top of with England’s Beth Mead, and anything to do with individual glory, reiterating that it was about the collective. “I've been in this team for 10 years now,” she said. “The team spirit that we have in this team, I've never experienced anything like that. This makes it so special.” On top of her own form, that is another factor that is making this tournament so much fun for Popp. Having endured such a long and arduous path to this point, it’s something she is savouring even more. “To be honest, I have the impression that at the moment I can experience these moments a lot more,” she added. “I'm enjoying these moments a lot more.  ""The football, I like it even more than before. That sounds silly. It doesn't mean I didn't like football before but it kind of became a bit pedestrian. “Now, to have the moments on the pitch, to play here, I value that a lot and that makes it very special to be here.” On Sunday, she’ll get to enjoy a Women’s Euros final at a sold-out Wembley Stadium, as Germany play hosts England for the trophy. If she and her team keep playing like this, she’ll still be enjoying it come full-time as well.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/incredible-story-alex-popp-germany-record-breaking-women/blt511a8d64ddfe4ea2,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
57,USWNT prospect Rodman feuds with Gotham FC keeper Harris in Twitter spat over dribble move,"United States women's national team prospect Trinity Rodman was involved in a feud with Gotham FC goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris on Twitter over a dribble move in an NWSL contest on Friday. Rodman and Harris lined up on opposite sides in a 1-1 draw between the Washington Spirit and Gotham FC in the Challenge Cup group stage on the artificial turf at Segra Field. After the match, the home side posted a video of Ashley Sanchez leaving Ali Krieger on the floor with a neat piece of skill on the right wing, which provoked an angry response from the latter's team-mate Harris. The Washington Spirit's post included the caption ""Hey Gotham FC, too soon?”, to which the Gotham No.1 replied: ""Get us a professional field and then we can talk.  ""Until then take your amateur sh*t back to your high school field.” Hey @GothamFC, too soon? pic.twitter.com/F3kkXz4OAP Washington Spirit forward Rodman, who made her debut for the USWNT in February, hit back at Harris by claiming that no one else struggled to stay on their feet during the game. ""I didn’t see anyone else fallin like that? U can accept her ankles got broke,"" said the 18-year-old. Harris couldn't resist getting in the last word after Rodman's intervention as she poked fun at her lack of experience at international level, with the 36-year-old having represented the USMNT on 25 occasions herself. ""Oh my bad… one camp in and she’s feeling confident hunny,"" she replied.

137,Norway star Hegerberg pays tribute to shooting victims as teams provide emotional support to grieving country,"Norway star Ada Hegerberg paid a touching tribute to the victims of this weekend's nightclub shooting by raising her rainbow captain's armband after scoring against New Zealand on Saturday.  The Scandinavian nation was rocked by the attack in the early hours of Saturday morning outside a popular gay nightclub in Oslo.  Two other venues were also targeted, with at least two people killed and 21 injured. Hegerberg, who plays her club football for Lyon in France, played for Norway on Saturday just hours after the shooting.  And after hitting the net against New Zealand the forward held up the rainbow band as a mark of respect, later publishing a photo of the gesture on Twitter alongside the message ""Love"".  🤍🏳️‍🌈 #Love pic.twitter.com/BywpxHaF6V The 26-year-old is one of women's football's premier stars, lifting the 2018 Ballon d'Or.  She is also known for her activism, particularly when it comes to the issue of equal pay.  Hegerberg stepped down from international duty for several years due to a dispute with the Norwegian FA over the treatment of women players, before returning in 2022 ahead of the European Championship.  ""It was tough at so many [international] camps. I have been broken mentally,"" she said to Josimar in 2019 in explaining her decision to miss that year's World Cup. ""It has been a deeply depressing feeling. I had nightmares after being with the national team, you shouldn't have things like that. If you want to get anywhere in life you have to make choices.

148,'I went to the games and then straight to the tattoo shop!' - Football fans and their ink,"2022 marks the year of the UEFA Women's Euro and the FIFA Men’s World Cup. All this week, VICE and GOAL will be collaborating to publish insightful, interesting stories from the world of football and fan culture, introducing VICE fans to GOAL and GOAL fans to VICE. Footballers and tattoos walk hand in hand nowadays, with it rare for a top-flight game to go by without at least a handful of players sporting some ink on their body. For most players, their tattoos are a small reflection of their personalities, offering an insight into more than just their public image. Meanwhile, in the stands, increasing numbers of supporters are also keen to show off their tattoos, particularly those with a footballing theme. Supporting their club is an aspect of their personalities that these fans are keen to display, so we spoke to four such die-hards to understand the inspiration behind their tatts: VICE x GOAL: What’s your name? Harry Brinkley. How old are you? Twenty-three. And how many football tattoos do you have? Four in total, but it forms one big sleeve. How long have you had that for? It started in 2019 and it finished roughly late last year. So, all in all, two-and-a-half to three years. Why did you get it? Growing up, I was always massively into football. I always loved Barcelona. When I was a kid, Messi was my favourite player, so it sort of went together. Where did you get it done? I got it done by Sammy Kent. She used to work at a different tattoo shop, but she’s opening her own shop soon. She did all of it. Do you have any funny stories about tattoos? Erm, more so now I’ve got it finished. All the time in London on tubes and stuff, I’ll be on an escalator and I feel the person behind taking pictures of me, or stuff like that. That must be annoying? I’ve been stopped so many times, in places like the Nike shop in London. How do you feel about that? It's a bit awkward, especially when they don’t ask. The guy on the escalator, I literally turned around and saw this flash going off. I was like, ‘What are you doing?’ And he said, ‘I really like your tattoo’, which is cool, but he could have asked first! Do you have any plans on getting anymore of an extension on it? I think I will be getting the top done at some point, but that’ll be Chelsea-themed, because I support both. Do you have a design ready for that? I’ve got a few pictures in mind that I want to get on it. But it’s just a case when I’m sort of free and have the money to get it done. I can imagine it’ll be quite expensive. How much has it cost so far? I lost count halfway through! It’s definitely over £2,000 ($2,600), easily. I’m not sure of the grand total. Have you seen Barcelona play? I’ve been a few times. I’m actually going in May this year. With lockdown and stuff, it’s been hard recently. What’s your name? Manuel. And how old are you? I’m 55. So, how many football tattoos do you currently have? One here (points to his arm), the back of the head and one on this leg. And I’ve got the badge, but it’s all bandaged up on the leg due to an abscess. That's the reason why I can’t get to any of the matches. But I’ll be going next season when it starts, in October-ish time. You’ve got a season pass already? Yeah, I've got all of that. Two grand… I’ll go to all the home games and that. Where do you sit in the stadium? I sit near the flag, where they take the corner. That’s my area. No one can take that area. I want to see them taking the corners. When did you get your first tattoo and which one was it? This one (points at the back of his head) was eight years ago. What was the reason for it? It’s not to show people I’ve got a tattoo on the back of my head, it’s just like... Arsenal has always been my team. And this is the only way. I told the tattoo artist to put it there, so now everyone knows. I’ve got the jacket too in the wardrobe. I’ve got three jumpers of theirs. The jackets cost me £150 ($200) each. Bloody hell, that’s quite expensive! Yeah. Do you go to the same place to get your tattoos done? Yeah, I go to the same place. I go to London to get it done, up the Angel. It's a man I know there who does it cheap. Did he do your other non-football tattoos too? Yeah, he does. Does he do other people's football tattoos? Nah, he just did this one as a favour for me. He can’t touch anyone else’s, but he did that for me because I know the guy. Do you have any plans for anymore tattoos? No, because I think the prices have gone up. I guess you don’t really need anymore? My sister has loads of tattoos. Is it a family thing? Yeah, my dad, sister and the rest. What’s your full name? Trisha Bergonzi How old are you? I turned 73 on St. Patrick's Day. What a great day to have a birthday! It’s the best. Your football team is...? Liverpool. How long have you been a supporter of Liverpool? Since I was 12. And is there a reason as to why you became a supporter of Liverpool? Erm, it’s maybe because one of my cousins was a red hot Liverpool fan and I copied them, which wasn’t very nice for my father as he was an Evertonian! There were seven in my house, they were all Evertonians and I was the only one that wasn’t. Every Saturday morning, the buses used to go past mine, we had a pub in Scotland Road. The buses used to go past, they’d stop at the bus stop and they’d all be getting on, all the tough guys except me. I’d be hanging out of the window crying my eyes out. My dad locked me in and then he used to let me out at half-time. But I thought bugger him, I’m going to go anyway! So, I sneaked out and ran all the way to Anfield, which is quite the journey up a hill. Were you living quite far from the ground? Not too far. In a car it would take about eight mins or so. At full-time, I’d come back down to the pub and my father was sitting in the parlour with customers and friends. I stood with my hands behind my back, looking down. And I’d say to him, ‘Guess where I’ve been dad.' ‘Where you been, girl?’ ‘I’ve been to Anfield…’ It was murders, he had me by my hair and swung me all around! Bloody hell! It was serious business. Where I lived as well – the famous road, Scotland Road – that used to be the main road that all the lorry drivers used to go from the continent, from the Liverpool Docks to Scotland. Is the pub still in the family, or...? They knocked it down. Like most pubs? Yeah, they built the motorway. I think there were 156 pubs on Scotland Road. There’s two now. That’s sad. Yeah, I was born there and the flat we lived in is now listed. I used to play football there and they had these big black railings out in the street and they’re still there. It was the place we all played footy and that, you know, and they’re still there ‘til this day. That’s great, it's nice to know there’s something still there that you can remember. Lots of history in Liverpool. How many football tattoos do you have? Just the one. What was the reason for getting that? To pay homage to Liverpool Football Club. Where did you get it done? I got it done in Clerkenwell – Family Business Tattoo. The manager’s name is David – we call him Elvis because he’s got a big curled quiff! When did you get it done? Probably 10 years ago now. I wouldn’t go to anyone else and wouldn’t recommend anyone else either. How did you find out about the parlour? He was a customer of mine. Do you have other tattoos? No, just the Liverpool one. That’s amazing, I love that. Originally, I wanted to get the two birds, one on each arm. Do you have funny anecdotes or stories about your time supporting Liverpool? The best time was when we won the Champions League in Istanbul. I went out there… It was absolutely brilliant, the stories – you’d be here all day! I can imagine… I had all the players in front me on the plane in first class. It was just amazing. Such a great time. What’s your name? Nathan Jarvis. And how old are you? Forty-nine. How many tattoos do you have in total? In total, about 18 tattoos. And how many are football related? Six Chelsea ones. Nice, and can you talk me through them? The Chelsea emblem on the side of my leg, I had that done when Chelsea won the double in 2010. I got the European Cup one because I went to Munich to watch the final we won in 2012. And the following year we went to Amsterdam, Chelsea won the UEFA Cup in 2013. Did you get them done in Amsterdam and Munich? I went to the games, literally came home and pretty much went straight to the tattoo shop. Do you go to the same place every time? These three are all from the same place in Sunbury by Jason Davies. He's done all of them. What was the reason you got the first one? What spurred you on to get your first football tattoo? I’ve been going Chelsea since I was eight years old. My brother used to take me. As I got older, then I started getting tattoos.  I decided to get a small Chelsea emblem and then the other ones followed really. Going travelling around watching Chelsea and then going to European games and deciding to get the trophies tattooed on me. Do you plan on getting anymore? Probably not, no. Now that I'm approaching 50 I probably won’t have anymore tattoos. Well, football tattoos anyways. Do you have any stories or anecdotes to go with the tattoos? The trophy ones on my leg are about travelling away to Europe, and I don’t really remember too much about either of the trips! There is a bit of a story from when we were in Munich. Me and the group of friends spent time just outside of the town in a bar, because in the middle of the town it got really busy, so we stayed most of the day. It got to about 4 or 5pm, and we decided to head over to the game. Went to the train station and it was shut. So, we literally had a bit of panic, there were no taxis available as you can imagine everyone at that sort of time was going to the game. There was an open top bus going down the road. I decided to jump in the road and stop it. It was a Corona beer promotion bus full of Munich supporters, and after a bit of conversation with them, they let me and my four friends onto the bus and they drove around Munich. We had Chelsea flags on top of the bus and they dropped us at a station, and we just got on the train and got to the game! That’s funny, it’s kind of the opposite of how you’d want it to play out, jumping on a bus full of Munich supporters. Yeah, we literally got to the point where we knew we couldn’t get to the game. Obviously, we travelled to Munich the day before and were drinking and whatever. Got right to the last minute and we were sure we’d miss the game.

155,Rodman earns first USWNT call-up as Andonovski names 25-player January camp roster,"Trinity Rodman has earned her first call-up to the U.S. women's national team (USWNT) as the Washington Spirit star headlined Vlatko Andonovski's 25-player roster for the team's January camp. The 19-year-old emerged as a breakout star in 2021, winning the NWSL Rookie of the Year award and leading the Spirit to the league title.  The USWNT's January camp will take place in Austin, Texas from January 19-28, and will not include any matches.  “Without any matches that we need to taper for, we can get in some more intense trainings and full-field scrimmages, which is great as we need to give this group as many chances as possible to play together in a national team environment,” Andonovski said in a federation press release.  Rodman is the youngest player on the roster and is followed by the top pick in the 2022 NWSL Draft, Naomi Girma, who is 21. Andonovski has left off a number of the team's veteran stars like Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, Tobin Heath, and Becky Sauerbrunn, as he aims to evaluate players looking ahead to the 2023 World Cup. Full roster Goalkeepers: Aubrey Kingsbury (Washington Spirit), Casey Murphy (North Carolina Courage), Alyssa Naeher (Chicago Red Stars) Defenders: Alana Cook (OL Reign), Abby Dahlkemper (San Diego Wave FC), Tierna Davidson (Chicago Red Stars), Imani Dorsey (NJ/NY Gotham FC), Emily Fox (Racing Louisville FC), Naomi Girma (San Diego Wave FC), Sofia Huerta (OL Reign), Kelley O’Hara (Washington Spirit), Emily Sonnett (Washington Spirit) Midfielders: Lindsey Horan (Portland Thorns FC), Jaelin Howell (Racing Louisville FC), Rose Lavelle (OL Reign), Kristie Mewis (NJ/NY Gotham FC), Samantha Mewis (Kansas City Current), Ashley Sanchez (Washington Spirit), Andi Sullivan (Washington Spirit) Forwards: Ashley Hatch (Washington Spirit), Mallory Pugh (Chicago Red Stars), Margaret Purce (NJ/NY Gotham FC), Trinity Rodman (Washington Spirit), Sophia Smith (Portland Thorns FC), Lynn Williams (Kansas City Current)",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rodman-uswnt-call-up-andonovski-january-camp-roster/blta59ed8df399960f5,By Seth Vertelney,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
179,Real Madrid accused of 'dangerous environment' for women's players,"Real Madrid Femenino have been accused of fostering a ""dangerous environment"" for players by outgoing forward Kosovare Asllani, who alleges the club pushes their squad members to play with injuries. The Sweden international first arrived at Las Blancas in 2019, and was their player of the season across the 2020-21 campaign. But reflecting on her time there as she prepares to depart as a free agent, she has now blasted Madrid's attitude towards their players, suggesting that they have been forced beyond their reasonable limits. ""I think there is a culture at the club which is unhealthy for players to be in,"" Asllani stated at a press conference. ""I have almost been forced to play injured. ""The management team has not listened to the medical team. It has become a very unhealthy and dangerous environment. I have done a lot for the club from the beginning and I have seen that the club has not treated players well over the years ""I think it's important for me to talk, since no-one else has. I have tried to make changes, but in the end, the environment created there is one of refusing to listen to the medical team and the players."" Previous reports had suggested that all was not well at the club, with previous coach David Aznar criticised for his training style before he was replaced by Alberto Toril last November. Asllani however felt that there was not enough of a change to sway her to remain, adding: ""It is no coincidence that I was injured there and had a setback, as you are constantly pushed to play injured. It is not a healthy environment. ""I care so much about the club, but I feel that it is in the wrong hands. I might have left last summer, but I gave it one last chance. I've been a big part of the club's history, but unfortunately it's an environment that is not healthy, and it's not just me. ""There are an incredible number of players who have had to go through a lot, which is not right at a top club. I think it's an environment created by just wanting results and seeing players as products.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/real-madrid-accused-of-dangerous-environment-for-women-s/blt463093969d52582f,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
182,Barcelona star Putellas in race against time for World Cup after ACL surgery,"Barcelona star Alexia Putellas has undergone a successful operation on an anterior cruciate ligament injury. The 28-year-old sustained the injury just days before the beginning of the 2022 Women's European Championship, ruling her out of contention for Spain. Now the Barcelona captain will be in a battle to ensure she can compete for the national team in next year's World Cup as it was confirmed she will be out for an extended period of time. Barcelona confirmed that the playmaker had an operation on Tuesday morning but expect her to be out of action for up to a year. A statement read: ""The FC Barcelona Medical Services are pleased to announce that Tuesday morning's operation on Alexia Putellas at Hospital de Barcelona was a success. 🚨 OFFICIAL | Alexia Putellas has successfully undergone surgery for the rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee and will be out for about 10 to 12 months. 🥺💔 pic.twitter.com/8IJDH4eEh2 ""The women's team captain and world player of the year has torn cruciate ligaments in her left knee, and will be out of action for between 10 and 12 months.

The game in Columbus, Ohio was widely expected to see Vlatko Andonovski's side score plenty of goals and that's what transpired after a slightly slow start. By full-time, the USWNT were one goal shy of hitting double figures and, in addition to Smith's personal milestone, Jaelin Howell and Ashley Sanchez scored their first goals for the national team. The USWNT took the lead on 26 minutes and, within 15 seconds of Uzbekistan kicking off, the hosts were 2-0 in front thanks to Mallory Pugh's goal.

210,"England Women's 2022 fixtures & results: World Cup qualifying group, Euros & Lionesses' match schedule in full","It came home. 2022 will forever be remembered as a defining year for England as the Lionesses won the Euros on home soil, defeating Germany in the final. The Lionesses had an eventful 2021, with three different people holding the role of head coach over the year, but ended the year in strong form under new boss Sarina Wiegman, scoring 53 goals and conceding none in her first six games. That good form continued on straight to the Euros, as Wiegman and England wrote their names into history with their Euros triumph. The Lionesses kicked off the year in February, with Spain, Germany and Canada all travelling to England for the Arnold Clark Cup. All four faced off in a round-robin tournament that began on February 17, with the winner crowned on February 23. It was indeed England that emerged victorious, after following up draws against Canada and Spain with a victory over Germany - only their second ever against a huge European rival. Spain also ended the tournament with two draws and a win, but the Lionesses topped the standings by virtue of goal difference. In April, Wiegman's team resumed its World Cup qualifying with a resounding 10-0 victory over North Macedonia, Beth Mead scoring four goals while Ella Toone netted her second senior international hat-trick. The team followed that up with another big win a few days later, beating Northern Ireland 5-0. In the build-up to the Euros, the Lionesses also won all three of their pre-tournament friendlies against Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland - the second result the most impressive, given the Dutch are the reigning European champions. They went on on to roll to the Euro 2022 final, where they took down Germany 2-1 in extra time. Just 34 days after that triumph, England then confirmed their place at the 2023 Women's World Cup by beating Austria 2-0, sealing the spot with a game to spare. In their final game, they maintained their perfect record in qualifying by beating Luxembourg. They then closed out the year with a series of friendlies, avoiding defeat in all to ensure Wiegman's unbeaten record as England coach remained in tact - with the win over the world champions, the United States, at Wembley a huge statement in particular going into next summer's World Cup. The Lionesses will next be in action in February 2023 when they host the second edition of the Arnold Clark Cup, a friendly tournament which they won last year in the build-up to the Euros. In April, as European champions, they then face Brazil in the first Women's Finalissima at Wembley, following the South American side's Copa America triumph, while their group stage fixtures for the Women's World Cup have also been confirmed.  Check out England's full schedule for 2023, which will include a women's Nations League for the first time, here.

216,John Terry-led 'True Blues' consortium attempts to secure 10% stake in Chelsea for £250m,"Chelsea legend John Terry and former women's football star Claire Rafferty are fronting up a £250 million ($329m) consortium called True Blues in an attempt to buy a 10 percent stake in the club.  With Terry having delved into the world of Non-fungible tokens [NFTs] recently, the bid promises a high-tech approach, allowing supporters, players and former staff to buy fan tokens for upwards of £100 in exchange for voting rights.  However, the group won't be able to fund a full bid so must insert itself into a wider deal involving UK, US or Saudi billionaires.  Although the True Blues consortium is headed up by two high-profile former footballers, there are several other people driving the bid. In documents seen by GOAL, one figure behind the bid is Chelsea supporter and prominent Tory party donor David Meller, alongside his son Jonathan. Harley Kisberg, founder of iTech Media, and Stanford Loudon, an investment banker, are also among fellow fans and founding members.  These connections have allowed those involved to speak with senior staff at the club before launching the bid.  Meller, whose wealth comes from his luxury property and family beauty business, could attract some criticism towards the group. He was awarded a lucrative £164m PPE contract during the coronavirus pandemic after supporting Michael Gove's Conservative Party leadership bid, with documents claiming he benefited from a controversial 'VIP lane' that allowed influential individuals an opportunity to circumvent the usual procurement process.  Furthermore, he was the chairman of the President's Club, a high-end, men-only charity event, which led to a sexual harassment scandal.  After the scandal, MPs subsequently lobbied for him to step down from a senior position in the Department for Education (DfE) after a report was released by the Financial Times.  Meller is also said to have previously worked with Chelsea in a charitable capacity. The plans, which have been seen by GOAL, suggest they will offer tokens to Kai Havertz for scoring his Champions League-winning goal and club captain Cesar Azpilicueta. It would effectively offer current players shares for their impact on the pitch.  The plans have already been presented to prominent fans ahead of the announcement in an attempt to begin a charm offensive.  It comes after the Chelsea Supporters Trust (CST), the west Londoners' most influential fan group, called for several measures including a 'golden share' to be issued.  That golden share would allow Blues fans veto power over matters relating to the club's identity including the club badge, kit or stadium, or playing in a different league. The last point is important after Chelsea were involved in the Super League project which was widely derided by the vast majority of the British public.  They went on to make six further requests but neither the UK Government nor Raine Group, who are conducting the sale, will enforce any such measures.  It remains on the negotiating parties to choose to bring in any fans through either the golden share or the True Blues consortium. However, for the True Blues consortium to even be considered, it will need considerable momentum from supporters.  The principal consortium partners now have until Friday at 9pm UK time (5pm EST) to make their offers.  The list will then be whittled down to three or four bids for further discussions and negotiations before a decision is finally made.  The government is not involved in any of the decision-making but is simply there to ensure Roman Abramovich doesn't take any of the money while he is sanctioned. The money will either be frozen or given to charity. ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/john-terry-true-blue-consortium-chelsea/bltca34870cca575d1e,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
221,Watch: Mount & Foden celebrate wildly in Wembley stands after England Women's historic Euros triumph,"Mason Mount and Phil Foden celebrated wildly together in the Wembley stands after seeing the England Women's team emerge triumphant over Germany in the Euro 2022 final. Ella Toone opened the scoring for the hosts just after the hour mark, but Germany's Lina Magull equalised late on to force extra time.  In the game's dying embers, Manchester City's Chloe Kelly tapped the ball home after a goalmouth scramble that ensured Sarina Wiegman's troops lifted the trophy - much to the delight of Mount and Foden. The two England men's national team stars were in attendance at Wembley to watch the Lionesses in live action, and were elated following their European Championship triumph. Chelsea midfielder Mount posted a video of the celebrations with Manchester City rival Foden as the pair sang along with the crowd and jumped up and down in jubilation after the final whistle. Tottenham striker Harry Kane, who plays alongside Mount and Foden for the England men's team, took to social media to congratulate the Lionesses and marvel at the ""unreal scenes"" at Wembley stadium. Absolutely unreal scenes at Wembley!! Massive congrats to the amazing @Lionesses!! @ellatoone99 take a bow for that finish too 👌 England's Raheem Sterling, Marcus Rashford and Harry Maguire were also among those to pay tribute to the Lionesses - who managed to bring their country's 56-year wait for major silverware to an end in style.

231,USWNT bounces back at SheBelieves Cup with assist from generous New Zealand own goals,"The U.S. women's national team was looking for an attacking spark after Thursday night’s scoreless draw with Czech Republic and they found it on Sunday – with a major assist from New Zealand. The USWNT took advantage of an unprecedented first-half hat-trick of own goals from Meikayla Moore – whose 50th international cap will be memorable for all the wrong reasons – as they cruised to a 5-0 victory in the second of three SheBelieves Cup matches. The Football Ferns offered a far more disjointed defensive performance than the Czechs did and the USWNT took full advantage as Sophia Smith and Midge Purce caused particular chaos on the flanks. Vlatko Andonovski will be happy to see his side bounce back ahead of Wednesday’s tournament finale against Iceland, but he’ll still have plenty to dissect as he looks to clinch the SheBelieves Cup with a win. Here are three observations from Sunday’s match at Dignity Health Sports Park Before Sunday, the USWNT had never been the beneficiary of three own goals in a game in its entire history. Against New Zealand it happened within 38 minutes, and all of them were scored by the same player. Ouch. When Moore was removed in the 40th minute it could have been read as an act of mercy from New Zealand coach Jitka Klimkova, but it seemed a bit harsh to shine a brighter light on the defender’s errors when she could’ve been more quietly taken off at the break. In her post-game press conference, Klimkova indicated she felt Moore wasn't up for the game mentally after her errors. ""A huge part in our game is mentality and if someone is ready to fight, then she's going to stay on the field,"" she said. ""Well, Meikayla is a thinker."" Of course, no own-goal hat-trick happens in a vacuum and it must be said that Moore was blameless on the second, and all three were the result of U.S. attackers putting in extremely dangerous services. It wasn’t Moore’s fault that American attackers had a free run on the flanks for most of the half. Ironically, Sunday should’ve been a day to recognize a major achievement for Moore, who already has a half-century of caps at age 25. But she’ll now have to simply take comfort in the fact that she is unlikely to ever have a tougher day in her career. One minute. Four minutes. Six minutes. That’s how long it’s taken Ashley Hatch to find the back of the net on her three most recent U.S. appearances. The NWSL Golden Boot winner continued making her case for more minutes at the No.9 position by scoring a 51st-minute header against New Zealand after coming on as a halftime substitute. She makes an instant impact...@ash_hatch33's last 3 caps:Nov. 27 — Scores 24 seconds after kickoffNov. 30  — Scores 3:16 after kickoffFeb. 20 - Scores 5:12 after entering match pic.twitter.com/EBh4NezCRN Hatch was only making her fifth USWNT appearances but the 26-year-old appears to be putting it all together for club and country at the right time, with Andonovski seemingly open to a generational change at his team’s attacking positions. Another NWSL star making her case is Sofia Huerta, whose first-half cross led to an own goal and whose second-half cross set up Hatch’s header. On Sunday Alyssa Naeher made her first start for the USWNT since last summer’s Olympics, and the goalkeeper returned to a different situation than the one she left in Japan. Casey Murphy had started the previous three U.S. games in goal and was hugely impressive, showing Naeher may have a fight on her hands to retain the starting role, particularly if she is unable to stay healthy. Naeher was not tested much against New Zealand but was solid when called upon. How Andonovski manages his goalkeeping situation, with NWSL standout Aubrey Kingsbury also on his roster, will be a storyline worth monitoring. In his post-game press conference, Andonovski hinted that Naeher is still his team's starter until proven otherwise. ""We have three super quality goalkeepers and just like in every other position, the goalkeeping position is a battle,"" the coach said. ""We know that Casey had a few good performances but we also know that it takes a little bit more than just two good games to be a quality international goalkeeper.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uswnt-bounces-back-at-shebelieves-cup-with-assist-from/bltc949799459203811,By Seth Vertelney,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

292,Former Venezuela WNT coaches banned after being found guilty of abusing players,"The Venezuelan Football Federation (FVF) has handed down bans to former women's team coaches Kenneth Zseremeta and William Pino following the conclusion of their investigation into allegations against the former of sexual abuse during his time in charge of the youth squad. An open letter signed by two-dozen players last autumn sparked an investigation into the pair's conduct during their tenure in the national set-up. With the conclusion of their operation, the FVF has now handed down lengthy sanctions to the duo, with Zseremeta banned for 20 years and Pino for eight. ""Given the public complaint made by some members of the women's team, based on the factual and legal considerations set forth, the Ethics Commission declared Zseremeta guilty,"" read an official statement. Additionally, the sentence ""prohibits for a period of 20 years their [Zseremeta ] participation in any type of activity related to soccer at the national level."" Pino was found ""guilty of infringing article 24 (protection of physical and mental integrity),"" the governing body added. Twenty-four Venezuelan women's footballers signed a statement last October, headed by Atletico Madrid's Deyna Castellanos, accusing former youth coach Zseremeta of sexual, physical and psychological abuse over a four-year period. The story broke following allegations against former North Carolina Courage boss Paul Riley over similar offences, and led to an investigation by FVF with Pino subsequently also drawn into the case.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/venezuela-wnt-coaches-banned-abusing-players/blt0f7cdc8f420a51f5,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

312,From dreamland to a horror trilogy: Xavi's Barcelona honeymoon is well and truly over,"Routing Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Napoli, and others - Xavi Hernandez’s arrival catapulted Barcelona into dreamland. But over the course of April, they have lurched into a much darker place. They awoke screaming, after losing three games in a row at Camp Nou for the first time in the club’s history, with Xavi’s honeymoon well and truly period over. For better or worse, it has been a whirlwind start in the dugout for the former Barca midfielder, who compared the 4-0 hammering of Real Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu to a sci-fi flick, but also admitted there have been “moments of horror”. There were further cuts from the latter genre screened at Camp Nou last week, as Barca fell 1-0 to relegation-battling minnows Cadiz on Monday, and then lost by the same score against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday. HIGHLIGHTS: #BarçaRayo 0-1⚡️ @RayoVallecano get their second win of the season over Barcelona!#LaLigaSantander pic.twitter.com/hRgYf50sND More instalments lie ahead, with Mallorca, another side fighting for their lives, visiting Camp Nou this coming Sunday. The script they need to follow to beat Barcelona was written by both Cadiz and Rayo. A low block, organised time-wasting, rotating through different players going down injured or with cramp and stopping the game with repeated small fouls. The Blaugrana's downturn in form has put their hopes of a second-place finish, and even Champions League qualification, at risk. The performances against Cadiz, in particular, was as disappointing and stolid as the end of the Ronald Koeman era. The sheen of Barcelona’s form at the start of the year, going 15 games unbeaten, has vanished. “I understand it’s not as motivating for the fans and players to fight for second place,” said Xavi, ""but we have to be in the Champions League, we want to hear the Champions League music next season. ""We have to go into the games better. In the first half, we were not good. In the second better. We tried everything but the situation is difficult. I recognise as a coach that I made a mistake in not motivating them."" Losing at home against Eintracht Frankfurt was also a brutal blow, not just for their hopes of winning the Europa League, but also for the team’s morale, in a stadium filled with jubilant away fans who revelled in seeing their team go 3-0 up. Eintracht supporters snapped up tickets for the game at Camp Nou, with a reported 30,000 in attendance, filling the iconic Plaza Catalunya and singing their way to Les Corts. The club’s ‘grada d’animació’ (singing stand) protested the club allowing so many visiting fans in by boycotting the clash with Cadiz, leaving a strange, hollow atmosphere inside the cavernous arena.  Although they returned against Rayo, the attendances for both games were in the mid 50,000s, figures put to shame by Barca Femeni, the club's women’s team. They have played twice at Camp Nou in the last few weeks, in the Women’s Champions League, with world-record attendances of over 90,000 there to see triumphant thrashings of Real Madrid and Wolfsburg, respectively. The Eintracht controversy also led to a club inquisition, where president Joan Laporta sought to blame some season-ticket holders who sold their passes and an archaic bookings system which got overloaded, without accepting much responsibility. On the pitch, Barca peaked at the Bernabeu before the international break and have suddenly run out of steam, similar to last season when they thrashed Real Sociedad at the same juncture and then threw away the title. Xavi has acknowledged that playing a high pressing game, something the club have not practised in recent years, has taken a toll on his players. Pedri’s injury has been a big problem, too. Xavi’s Barcelona hit full strength when the Canary Islander was at his effervescent best, running the show and feeding the forwards ahead of him, but he is now out for the rest of the campaign with a torn hamstring. From the moment he disappeared, the team deflated. Ansu Fati has also been missing, and his potential return as a substitute against Mallorca offers one glimmer of hope for the last five games of the season. The teenager raised morale at the club when he came back from injury against Levante in September, and the hope is he can do the same again. Xavi remarked with surprise upon his arrival that a lot of the players were not trained in Barcelona’s positional play, and that is still proving a challenge. Sergino Dest - another who is now out for the rest of the season due to injury - did not track Alvaro Garcia’s run well enough for Rayo’s goal, while Frenkie de Jong was substituted early after another poor performance. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, meanwhile, has been in resplendent goalscoring form but is struggling with hold-up play and control, which is a problem in a team that wants to keep the ball at all times. Against Real Sociedad on Thursday, Barca had less possession than their opponents, just scraping a 1-0 win thanks to profligate finishing from the Basques. There is a lot for Xavi to work on, both tactically and mentally, in what will be a long week in Catalunya before Mallorca arrive on Sunday, hoping to add a fourth horror film to Barca’s collection.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/dreamland-horror-trilogy-xavi-barcelona-honeymoon-over/bltbbc7eebc563354f2,Rik Sharma,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
314,What is the women's football attendance record?,"Women's football is playing catch-up with the men's game, but positive strides have been made in recent years as investment and interest grows. The scale of the growth can be charted in attendances at fixtures and the world record for a women's game was smashed twice in 2022, with fans of Barcelona in particular helping to surpass a high-point that had stood for 23 years. So what is the record attendance for a women's football game? GOAL takes a look at the biggest sold-out games in the history of the sport. The world record attendance for a professional women's football match is 91,648. It was set on April 22, 2022, when Barcelona Women played Wolfsburg Women in the UEFA Women's Champions League semi-final at Camp Nou.

320,'Barca changed the game but Lyon was here first' - Inside OL's Women's Champions League comeback,"As players sprinted onto the pitch from the Paris Saint-Germain bench, overjoyed and ecstatic, there was a striking contrast with the way in which their Lyon counterparts slowly walked through the pandemonium. The seven-time European champions had just suffered their first Women’s Champions League exit in seven years and only their fifth ever defeat to their arch-rivals. But while setbacks of this nature often result in those on the losing side falling to the ground, unable to hold back the tears, on this occasion, there was more a steely look of acceptance in the eyes of those leaving the pitch of the empty Groupama Stadium. They knew it wasn’t good enough. Some predicted that this result would be the beginning of the end for the greatest dynasty in women’s football – and one of the greatest in sporting history. With the league title also surrendered to PSG, it would be OL’s first trophyless season since 2006. But those who did write off this team certainly look foolish now. UWCL final stream links 👇 English - https://bit.ly/BarcelonaLyonEN Spanish - https://bit.ly/BarcelonaLyonES French - https://bit.ly/BarcelonaLyonFR This weekend, Lyon are back in the UWCL final and in search of a victory that would extend their record as the continent’s most successful women’s team. Yes, last season didn’t go to plan, but it’ll take more than that to take down a club like this. When GOAL asks Janice Cayman, the Lyon full-back who spent eight years playing for rival teams in France, what it was like to play against the club before she joined, her response is telling: “We called them a machine."" “They were so good with the passing, positioning, and it was just wave after wave coming,” she adds. “At some point, you know you're going to mess up somewhere and they're going to score and then it's even harder to stop them. “I was really looking forward to having that feeling being in Lyon, to be kind of invincible.” Invincible – that’s the reputation this club and these players have. Captain Wendie Renard has won seven Champions League titles and made more appearances in the competition than any other player. Sarah Bouhaddi, Eugenie Le Sommer and Amel Majri all have seven winners’ medals too, with Delphine Cascarino, Ada Hegerberg and Amandine Henry not far behind on five. They’re not used to being the team watching another celebrate, that’s for sure. “It was rough,” Cayman remembers. “We asked ourselves a lot of questions. We know we have the quality and the good players, but for some reason it didn’t match 100 per cent on the field.” “I think, if anything, it served as extra fuel for us this year,” Catarina Macario, the U.S. women’s national team forward who arrived early last year, tells GOAL. “It was like, 'Alright, we were nowhere close to where we wanted to be, or what OL is used to in their history', and so we knew that we really needed to take it up a few notches. “But not only that, it showed that other teams are catching up. We're no longer the only team to be beat. There are a lot of other teams that are really putting in investment and have really talented players in their squad. “It just means that we have to be even better than ever before. We took that almost like with a grain of salt, like, 'Alright, now the fight is back on'. That's what's been cool about this year, because we're fighting for something, you know? “It's been really cool to be a part of and to be in this new transitional period of the team and of trying to regain our European title.” The use of the possessive perfectly sums up the dominance Lyon has enjoyed in Europe over the past decade – but last season they would have to watch another team, Barcelona, lift the trophy. The last time they did that, in 2015, it was motivating. Two years in a row, they went out in the last 16 and, two years in a row, they had to watch the latter rounds of the competition from the comfort of their own homes. “I said: ‘I don’t want to watch it again on my TV. I want to play these games’,” Le Sommer said of that barren period in an interview with GOAL back in 2020. “It was a motivation for me, it was for the team too. This experience made us better and stronger in our mentality.” Barcelona Femeni v Lyon.The Women's Champions League is set 🍿 pic.twitter.com/jUb2m9cdOn After that came five successive titles. That’s telling of the mentality and resilience within these players. With that in mind, those at the club always knew that the response this season would be as good as it has been. “No one was happy with how last season ended,” Macario explains. “Even if we had won, we weren't playing good football. ""We wanted to use that as an extra motivation for us this year. The unhappiness and dissatisfaction from last year has definitely carried over.” But it is not just because of this motivation that Lyon are back in the final, nor is it only down to the squad’s insane mentality or world-class quality. It is all of this and more. In the aftermath of last season’s elimination, head coach Jean-Luc Vasseur was replaced with Sonia Bompastor. The 41-year-old has brought a lot of qualities to the role, but her experience of playing for Lyon and winning titles at the club is particularly special. “She's been in our situation,” Cayman says of Bompastor. “She knows sometimes the pressure is high as well. She was a very good player, and a very intense player, always giving it her all – a captain.” For Damaris Egurrola, the Netherlands midfielder, Camille Abily’s presence is also very important. “Every time she talks to me and tries to correct stuff, I'm really aware of it because I think she has been one of the best midfielders here in France and Lyon also,” she tells GOAL. “She was someone that I used to look up to and now she's the assistant coach, trying to help me perform and be better every day. I just try to learn every day from them. “They've been here a long time, also in the academies. They know how all the young girls work. They've been playing in this league for a long time, so they know all the teams, all the stadiums. ""In that sense, I think we prepared really well for the season because of their experience. That's really helpful for us.” The integration of some of those young talents – such as Alice Sombath, the teenage defender who ranked at No.6 in this year’s NXGN list – is promising for this club’s future. But it’s the return of some of their most established stars that has been a particularly significant factor in this season’s success. Neither Griedge Mbock Bathy – as reliable a centre-back as one could possibly hope to find – nor Ada Hegerberg, recipient of the 2018 Ballon d’Or, played a single minute of football last season due to injury. Their comebacks have been huge. “Those are two key players,” Cayman says. “It's very sad to see them not being able to play, but then when they get back, I think it's double the pleasure to see them doing what they're good at.” For Macario, one of the most promising young forwards in the world, to finally get to build that relationship with Hegerberg is big. Their link-up has been one of the most exciting things about Lyon this year. “She's not the greatest goalscorer in the history of the Champions League for nothing, you know? She's one of the best players in the world for a reason,” Macario laughs. “Having her back helps a lot! “It's not a one-person game – but she's Ada Hegerberg. She has a big presence on and off the pitch. In the locker room, she's almost like Wendie. “Wendie's a big captain, she's our captain. She's a big leader but Ada is definitely there with her in giving us that hype speech, in telling us, 'Hey, this is what we need to do', making sure that we all feel confident when stepping onto the pitch. “She is a big person that we definitely missed and it's so, so good to have her back. This is where she belongs and this is where OL belongs, too. This is what it's supposed to be like.” Ada Hegerberg silenced the Parc des Princes 🥶 pic.twitter.com/2OVCaieYTJ We are back to that familiar tale now of Lyon being in the final, but it’s a little different this time around because, for some, OL is not the favourite this weekend. It’s Barcelona – the reigning European champions, the team that just completed a perfect season in Spain’s domestic league, the team that has taken all of Lyon’s plaudits over the past 12 months. The French giants have long been considered the benchmark, but now Barca are being talked of as the example, of being the best. That’s another thing adding fuel to Lyon’s fire. ""There was women's football before Barcelona, ​​and it was played here for years,” Hegerberg told L’Equipe earlier this month. “We have to win again to regain our place in world football. We have the chance to do it this season. We have never lost against Barcelona."" It’s a feeling shared within the group. “I totally agreed when Ada said this,” Egurrola says. “With all respect for Barcelona, I think they changed the game in Spain. Everyone is crazy about them and it's really something that we need to give importance [to]. “They changed all the mentality of the people, all the crowd and everyone's reporting on Barcelona and Spain and that's really cool. Also, for us, it's a big change in women's football, that they came so strong. “But on the other side, I also think what Ada said, in the years before, Lyon was also here. They've been champions for the last 10 years and we don't have to forget that.” Barca certainly will not have forgotten as much. After all, they were on the wrong end of a 4-1 thumping in the 2019 final. They will see Saturday as a chance to get some revenge. But Lyon have that opportunity too. After PSG got the better of them last season, they thrust a dagger in their hearts at the Parc des Princes in the semi-finals, winning 2-1 to secure their ticket to Turin in front of the biggest crowd ever to watch the Parisians. Now, they can wrestle back their status as European champions from the team that took it from them. “We're really happy with how the season has gone,” Egurrola says, “but the best part is yet to come. We can't wait.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barca-lyon-story-behind-ol-women-champions-league-comeback/blta4a9018440faf514,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
336,Rivals? Chelsea justify Hayes' dismissal of Arsenal as Women's FA Cup triumph seals treble win,"“Playing against Arsenal as Chelsea manager is always a great game for us,” Emma Hayes told the press before Sunday’s Women’s FA Cup final against the Gunners. “But it has never been our rival game. Manchester City has always been that. “This is a London derby so it's slightly different. There's a lot more fan involvement, press interest, but I've always thought the bigger game was us versus Man City over the years.” It’s the type of quote that could have become infamous, one to fire up the opponent just days before the showpiece event at Wembley in front of a record crowd. In the end, the Gunners didn’t show too many glimpses of making Hayes eat her words. Chelsea were ruthless from the off, the frantic nature of the game suiting their transitional style best as only Arsenal goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger stopped them putting the game to bed before half-time. In the end, her efforts were in vain as the Blues emerged 3-0 winners. Arsenal didn’t have a shot on target all game. Chelsea had eight and hit the woodwork a further two times. Treble winners 🏆🔵 pic.twitter.com/eQnE6nMsfv With this the final from last season’s competition, due to Covid-19 disruptions, it doesn’t only make Chelsea FA Cup winners either. Indeed, after their league and Continental Cup triumphs, it makes them treble winners. In the latter competition, Arsenal were knocked out in the group stage. In the league, they finished third, nine points off the top. After the Gunners’ 3-2 win over the Blues at the Emirates to kick off the season, and their unbeaten league form that has them top of the Women’s Super League table, they are certainly making progress after a couple of difficult years under former coach Joe Montemurro. However, this game showed that those who doubted the significance of that result on the opening weekend had a point. With Sam Kerr and Fran Kirby among those on the Chelsea bench, after long summers with their national teams, the Blues weren’t at full strength. With ‘Kerrby’ on the pitch at Wembley, it was quite a different story. First goal – it was Kerr’s play that caused disruption in the Arsenal defence so Kirby could score. Second goal – it was Kirby’s pass that set Kerr free, and she did the rest. With Kirby substituted off when Kerr put away the third, it was just all about the Aussie’s skill, as she scooped the ball over Zinsberger to seal it. ""That was Fran's best game in a Chelsea shirt,"" Hayes said after the game. ""I thought she ran the show. She got on the ball in dangerous situations, she threaded Sam in on numerous occasions, but also herself was a real threat, a real handful throughout the game. ""I think Sam Kerr, so many wondered how she would handle the English game. As far as I'm concerned she's the best striker in the world and she displayed that when it mattered most.

346,Netherlands stars Miedema and Groenen test positive for Covid-19 in big blow to Euros holders,"Netherlands stars Vivianne Miedema and Jackie Groenen have tested positive for Covid-19, it was confirmed on Tuesday. The news comes as a big blow to the Oranje Leeuwinnen's hopes at the 2022 Women's European Championship, as the pair will likely miss Wednesday's clash against Portugal. The 25-year-old striker is the national team's top scorer of all-time and was the Player of the Match when they drew 1-1 with Sweden in their opening game of the campaign. Groenen, who has also long been a key player for the Dutch side, impressed against Sweden too and was confirmed to have contracted the virus. An update from Netherlands read: ""Vivianne Miedema has unfortunately tested positive for Covid-19 and will therefore be in isolation for the next few days.  ""When she no longer has any symptoms and tests negative, she can re-join the selection."" The same was said of 27-year-old Groenen. The news of the concerns surrounding Miedema and Groenen was confirmed just a day after the Dutch suffered a significant injury blow. Goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal was forced to leave the Netherlands squad after sustaining a shoulder injury during the match against Sweden. Feyenoord's Jacintha Weimar was called up to take her place, having been named on the team's standby list by coach Mark Parsons. Aniek Nouwen suffered an ankle injury in their first game of the competition and will likely miss the meeting with Portugal, but will stay with the squad. Miedema and Groenen are just the latest figures to have contracted Covid-19 at the tournament in England. At least nine players have tested positive so far. England's Lotte Wubben Moy, Lea Schuller at Germany, Finland's Tuija Hyyrynen, Laura Wienroither of Austria and Italy player Valentina Cernoia have all come down with Covid-19 at the Euros. Lisa Kolb tested positive before the tournament, meanwhile, and the figure could rise to 10 amid reports her Austria co-star Katharina Naschenweng has also come down with it.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/netherlands-miedema-groenen-covid-19-euros/blt00fc9fcfcccafe41,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

377,Watch: England players invade Wiegman press conference to sing 'It's coming home',"Sarina Wiegman's efforts to speak to the press following England's Euro 2022 victory were interrupted on Sunday due to a joyous invasion from her triumphant squad. The Lionesses were in a party mood after beating Germany after extra-time to lift their first Euro title. And they made their delight known to the world as Wiegman looked on, singing the famous 'Three Lions' anthem and climbing on the table to dance in front of their stunned, but amused manager. For the uninitiated, 'football's coming home' is a famous line from an iconic English football anthem called 'Three Lions'. The song, which was first released in May 1996 by Frank Skinner, David Baddiel and The Lightning Seeds, initially served as the soundtrack to Euro 96. A new version of the song was released ahead of the 1998 World Cup, but the chorus remained the same. 'Three Lions' was resurrected ahead of the 2018 World Cup and again at Euro 2020, with fans of the England women's team deploying it regularly at the Women's Euro 2022 along with 'Sweet Caroline'. Read GOAL's comprehensive guide to the classic 'Football's Coming Home' song.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/watch-england-players-invade-wiegman-press-conference-to-sing-it-/blte92d4a5511a29b76,Daniel Edwards,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
403,England to face USWNT at Wembley after Women's Euro triumph,"European champions England will face the world champions, the U.S. women’s national team, at Wembley on October 7. The Lionesses triumphed at the national stadium on Sunday evening to win the 2022 Women’s Euros, beating Germany 2-1 in extra-time. Now, they can look ahead to taking on another powerhouse of the game – the team that knocked them out in the semi-finals of the 2019 Women’s World Cup and has won the last two editions of the competition. The fixture is subject to England securing their place at the 2023 World Cup, but they only need a point from their final two qualifiers in September to do that and have won all eight of their games in the group so far. Speaking upon the announcement of this high-profile friendly, England head coach Sarina Wiegman said: “It is really exciting to have the chance to play the U.S. at Wembley if we can make sure of qualification for the World Cup. “It would be the perfect game for our squad to meet another strong team after so many tough games in the Euros. It is good we enjoy the moment we are in after this wonderful summer, but we know we still have to work to do to take the next step forward. “As a team, we take nothing for granted with our goal of reaching the World Cup and whoever we play at home in October, it will be special to have another Wembley fixture. ""After the positive experiences we have had this summer, it will be great to welcome as many fans as possible so that we can say thanks again for their incredible support.” Speaking on Monday at England’s victory party at Trafalgar Square, defender Lucy Bronze was already talking about her desire to secure that World Cup trophy next summer, and his fixture with the U.S. would serve as excellent preparation in that goal. “That will make [my trophy cabinet] full,” she said. “I think we’ve had a winning mindset for a couple of years now. We’ve been pushing that and just needed to match it on the field and we’ve finally done that. “It’s nice to be able to back up what we’ve been saying, that we’re good enough to win things, good enough to win tournaments and make finals. We’ve finally done that and we want to continue to do that. ""For a lot of the girls, that was their first tournament for England, and I think they think this is normal. That’s a great thing if they think that’s normal, then we have to keep getting to finals, that sets the standard.” Through the Football Association’s website, tickets for the game went on sale to My England Football members on August 2, with general sale beginning on August 3 at 2pm BST (6am PT/ 9am ET). Should England fail to secure World Cup qualification, and instead be involved in the play-offs in October, anyone with a ticket for the game would be entitled to a refund. The FA and U.S. Soccer would then work together to arrange a new date for the two sides to meet in the future.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-uswnt-wembley-womens-euro-triumph/blt0ab6f1cf9be9df25,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
433,'Xavi's comments made us really happy' – Barcelona star Rolfo relishing praise for women’s team ahead of Real Madrid clash,"Barcelona star Fridolina Rolfo says praise for the women’s side from Xavi is something that has pleased the whole squad – and that she and her team-mates want to show the world how good they are against Real Madrid on Wednesday. Xavi described Barca Femeni as “an example for the men’s team” after their league title triumph two weeks ago, Jonatan Giraldez’s side winning the trophy with a 100 per cent record. After a tough first leg in the Women’s Champions League quarter-finals against the club’s traditional rivals, Rolfo wants to back that praise up this week as the competition’s next round of games get underway – Barca to play theirs at a sold-out Camp Nou. Xavi lauded Giraldez’s team earlier this month, saying: ""For several years [the women's team] have been showing us the way with how they play, how they compete and the hunger they have despite winning everything last year. ""We have been watching them and it's a wonder to see them play. They are leading the way in the same way as the Dream Team did in their day or as Pep [Guardiola's] Barca side did later. They are an example for the men's team."" Asked about those comments on Monday, speaking to media ahead of Wednesday’s game, Rolfo said: “That's something the club are striving for - the playing style that we want to play, the typical Barca style. “Of course, it's something that makes us happy and I hope we can show the world and for women's football how we want to play and how good we are. That's the main goal.” Barca won the first leg of the quarter-final with Real Madrid 3-1, but only after the hosts went 1-0 up and competed with them like few teams have in the past two years. “I think it was good that we got this game because we were not happy with the first half,” Rolfo explained. “We were not playing well. We talked about it at half-time and we changed some things. I think we really showed a great mentality in the second half and got out there and were really performing. “Hopefully, we learned the lesson. Real Madrid, they were good - I don't know if it was a surprise, we know it's a great team, but if we compare it with the week before, it was another team that showed up there, if I have to say it like that. “It was tough, but I'm really happy that we could change the game, turn it around in the second half and we were performing really well. Hopefully, we learned something from this.” The return leg will be much different to any game these Barcelona players have played, as it will not only allow them to play in front of fans at Camp Nou for the first time, but the club has also sold all of the tickets. It did so in just four days, too. The spectacle it could be is something Rolfo admits she cannot help but think about this week, adding: “It's something we're really looking forward to and it's something I think about often. “It's a game that every footballer wants to play. You're practising for these games. For me, it's a dream coming true already, before the game started. I'm really excited.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/xavi-comments-really-happy-barcelona-rolfo-praise-women-real/blt0b0d805b85b45fbe,Amee Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

486,Not so fast! Lyon show new rival Barcelona they are still Europe's best in runaway Women's Champions League final win,"How many times have fans at a women’s football match needed to be escorted past rival supporters by the police? It’s a rarity, that’s for sure, but it was the case on Saturday evening in Turin, one of the most striking images outside the home of Juventus as Barcelona and Lyon prepared to do battle in the Women’s Champions League final. Barcelona were fuelled by their defeat to the French giants in the 2019 final, a 4-1 hammering that showed the Catalans the level they needed to reach in order to be European champions – a feat they finally achieved last May. But there would be no revenge here. Instead, it was a statement made by the now eight-time winners of this competition that their continental failure last year was merely a blip.  After a blistering start that included three strikes in the opening 33 minutes, Lyon emerged 3-1 winners in Italy and regained their status atop Europe. LYON BEAT BARCELONA TO WIN THE WOMEN’S CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 🇫🇷🏆 pic.twitter.com/VA602WramS However, Barcelona's strength cannot be dismissed on the back of a single outing.  On the night, yes, they were not as good as Lyon. The blueprint to beat the Blaugrana was exposed: you press them high, you make them panic and you take your chances. But it must be remembered that they enjoyed a near-perfect season in all competitions. This felt like the birth of a new rivalry, a back-and-forth set to unfold in the years to come rather than a powerhouse putting an upstart in its place. It was evident in the build-up to this game that there was a chip on Lyon’s shoulders. The plaudits Barcelona had won in the last 12 months have seemingly overshadowed the achievements of the French side, which have been and will be unmatched. ""There was women's football before Barcelona, and it was played here for years,” Lyon forward Ada Hegerberg told L’Equipe earlier this month.  “We don’t have to forget that,” midfielder Damaris Egurrola added, speaking to GOAL. In the press conference before the game, captain Wendie Renard took exception to the idea that Barcelona were the favourites in Turin.  “It’s the journalists that say we are outsiders,” she said. “We’ve got a final with two teams doing exceptionally well. For me, a final is 50-50. There is no favourite. There is no underdog.” Lyon win their eighth Women's Champions League title 🏆 pic.twitter.com/V4A2Xyn3eh There was the utmost respect between both sets of players going into the game, there is no doubt about that. But it’s no surprise that such a build-up created real spice in it. It wasn’t just the comments made, or the media’s words, but the presence of the fans, both sets so passionate and unwavering in their support for each side, too. Barcelona fans flooded Turin on Saturday, taking over entire streets with banners, drums and song. Lyon’s fans may have been outnumbered in size, but they made up for the numbers in voice, waving Norway flags in their corner of the crowd as an ode to Hegerberg, the talismanic figure who acted as conductor at times. As the Lyon goalkeepers came out for the warm-up, they were jeered as if the game was being played in Barcelona. When the teams were read out, it was the same. That atmosphere lay the foundation for what happened on the pitch. With the referee letting a lot of possible fouls go, it was an incredibly physical game with plenty of bite. After Lyon had raced into a 3-0 lead – thanks to Amandine Henry’s wonder-strike, Hegerberg’s back post header and Catarina Macario’s close-range finish – Alexia Putellas scored a superb goal to get Barcelona back in the game before half time. As soon as the ball had hit the back of the net, the Ballon d’Or winner was there to pick it up and run back to her own half, ready for kick-off. Before that though, she tossed the ball in the direction of Hegerberg, stood in the centre circle. ""Game on,"" the gesture suggested. Unfortunately for Barcelona, it wouldn’t be anything more than a consolation. They tried and tried to get another back – Patri Guijarro incredibly hitting the bar from halfway line – and the desire was evident in every moment on the pitch. When Griedge Mbock Bathy went down with an injury in the second half, Claudia Pina tried to get her off the ground and, when she did get up, Putellas picked up the bag of the medical team and moved it off the pitch. Moments before, Christiane Endler had pushed away Asisat Oshoala for closing her down more than she would’ve liked. It was a constant theme throughout the game but, once all was said and done, a baseline of respect remained in place. When the final whistle went, Putellas laid on the ground by the penalty spot, in the box nearest the thousands of Barcelona fans. Player after player went to console her, followed by staff member after staff member. It took a few minutes until she would pick herself up. When she did, over walked Hegerberg, one Ballon d’Or winner approaching another. She offered an embrace and a word in her ear. It was a moment which showed that while there is a rivalry out there, it is a rivalry built on respect. These are two exceptional teams and they help to push one another. For years, it was Wolfsburg that were Lyon’s biggest rival. It’s clear that now, it will be Barcelona. A picture that's worth 1000 words 😔 pic.twitter.com/v6HlLKyp5x “The memory of the 2019 final is bitter,” Putellas said this week. “It was a painful final. Our first final ended in the worst possible way. “It was very painful in the short term but in the long term I think it was good in some ways, because it showed us where we were as a team in terms of the level we needed to become European champions.” She and Barcelona came back from that and they will come back from this. When they do, it will continue the start of this incredible new battle among two of Europe’s most incredible sides. For now, though, the title of most incredible belongs to Lyon for a record eighth time - and it’s going to take something quite sensational to take it from them.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lyon-barcelona-womens-champions-league-final-rival/blt44ff2b2697c058b3,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
495,"'Should I play, or will I be abused?' - Rainbow Laces shines spotlight on transphobia in British football","""A ball was passed back to me, and to try and put me off the striker screamed 'go on big man'. For me, it was obvious that it was intended to abuse."" For Blair Hamilton, it was a moment of complete shock, followed by anger and upset - the first time she had suffered transphobic abuse from an opposition player on the pitch since coming out more than four years ago. Hamilton, who plays for Hastings United in the London and South East Regional Women's Football League, the fifth tier of the game in England, was playing in goal against Bromley in an FA Cup third-round qualifying match on October 24. Heading for a 2-0 defeat in the final minutes of the game, the sudden heckle from an opposition player stunned her completely. Speaking to GOAL, Hamilton says: ""I was shell shocked, to be honest. Straight away, I thought, 'did I just hear that?' Then I started screaming at the referee, and my centre-back, she heard it and started screaming at the referee. ""I was angry, upset - previous abuses I've had have never been direct to my face. Murmurings in the crowd, usually I don't hear them until someone lets me know afterwards. ""This is the first time in my four-and-a-half years in the women's game that anyone has abused me to my face. I won't lie, the red mist came down. Usually I'm composed, but I lost the plot, and I'm not embarrassed to admit that. You could have put six shots against me and I wouldn't have saved any of them, I was all over the place. I wanted justice. ""What I didn't get, our team was losing 2-0 and we were in the final five or 10 minutes. I couldn't get my head around why someone would do that when they're winning. You've got the upper hand, why do you feel the need to abuse someone? ""It has had a massive effect on me; luckily our game was cancelled the weekend after, because I went to training and my head was not in it. I trained terribly, I could not stop thinking about it."" It forms part of a trend, identified by transgender players and campaign groups, of a rise in transphobic abuse in football recently, as the matter becomes more of a point for toxic debate in social and traditional media. Football Association (FA) rules surrounding whether transgender females can play women's football are lengthy and stringent, however Natalie Washington, campaign lead for Football vs Transphobia, says she is hearing more and more about players being targeted with abuse both on and off the pitch, and that a more focused effort from the sport's governing bodies is required. She tells GOAL: ""Anecdotally, I am hearing more often from people who have experienced some form of transphobia in football. That cuts across playing or attending games. It speaks to a wider growth in transphobia. Transphobic hate is growing in society more generally, it is more at the forefront of peoples' minds. ""We are talking to FA and county associations, it is very early days in trying to get them to understand what transphobic abuse even looks like. I ran a session a while back with referees about how they can recognise transphobic abuse, and that is one of the big barriers. ""There is not a widely accepted definition of transphobia, it is a fast-evolving space, the language is different to 20 years ago but society has not necessarily kept up, so it is difficult for referees or FAs who are administering reports on harassment or discrimination to make the right decisions. ""We need to get to a point where transphobia is seen as real abuse and is taken seriously. Particularly with transphobic language, we can do better education to help clubs and academies to understand what it actually looks like, to give tools and resources to deal with that. ""Also, we have to have the processes to deal with incidents where people really want to hurt someone, and I would like to see county FAs make provisions in their policies for transphobia to show it is something that is taken seriously when reported. ""Kick It Out accepts reports of transphobic abuse through their app, but I still think we are at the stage where we are trying to make sure the football community at large has opposition to transphobia included in their policies."" That FA trans inclusion policy has been in place since 2014, from a review that began in 2012 - nine years ago. This is now being reviewed over the course of this season; the FA currently review player participation on a case by case basis. Edleen John, equality, diversity and inclusion director for the FA, says they continue to assert inclusion through their policies as much as possible. She tells GOAL: ""By participating in things like Rainbow Laces and making sure we are showcasing and talking about inclusion being our primary concern, and how we can put that into place in grassroots and recreational football, we continue to affirm and re-affirm that for us, football is for all."" Transphobia creating barriers to people taking part in football is an issue acknowledged by Jason Webber, equality, diversity, inclusion & integrity manager for the Football Association of Wales (FAW), who says they are working on ways to make victims feel they can be more comfortable reporting abuse, whether on the pitch, in the stands or online. The FAW has shown support for the LGBTQ+ community, most recently through extensive pride displays at Wales' World Cup qualifier against Belgium, but Webber acknowledges more consistent action has to be taken. He tells GOAL: ""The number of trans players we have in Wales is not as high as it should be. It's definitely something that we are conscious of, in regards to the environment within the game, ensuring that it is inclusive and that individuals are not getting transphobic abuse. I'm fully aware that it is something that is a wider societal issue, which has an impact within football.""We know all discrimination is under-reported, in Wales and elsewhere, in football and across other sports. It is something we try to be very vocal about, and we have seen a general increase following our campaigns and social media promotions. ""That visibility, while on its own can be a gesture, does form part of trying to raise awareness and ensuring people report these things and they are taken seriously. ""The way we are approaching this, it's not just for a couple of weeks then we're done, we're trying to be proactive with raising visibility and providing education throughout the year for fans around the LGBTQ+ community. ""We are aware that the reports we get are not reflective of reality, and we are working hard to ensure every incident is reported so we can support the victims and educate the perpetrators, and make sure there are serious sanctions in place as well."" 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️ Football is for everyone! Mae pêl-droed yn gêm i bawb. #RainbowLaces | #TogetherStronger pic.twitter.com/QWHjTRydoj Hamilton says she has had good support from Kick It Out and the PFA since reporting her abuse, but has had ""complete radio silence"" from Bromley and the FA - and that she and her team-mates have resolved to take more direct action should a repeat event take place. ""My captain, Rebecca Relf, has been very supportive,"" she says. ""We came to a decision afterwards that if this ever happened again, we would walk off as a collective unit. They say, we know this is a contentious topic, but we have played with you for eight months now, we win games and lose games, the fact you were assigned male at birth has nothing to do with it. ""It's great having all this support, but they can't make me forget what happened. I'm a Rangers fan, and last year you had the Glen Kamara racism incident. There are parallels; why would a player abuse someone just because they are 'different'? I've never truly understood how Kamara felt until that happened to me. I never thought that would happen."" Hamilton switched from male to female football in 2017 after beginning to medically transition, and was approached by the women's captain at the University of Aberdeen, where she was a student, asking if she wanted to join the club. For the 31-year-old, it is not the first time she has been singled out for complaints based on her gender - last season, she says, an opposing team filed a complaint to the FA despite recording a 3-1 victory, saying Hamilton kept the score down and the hit to their goal difference could cost them the title - but the recent increase in media coverage of trans people, especially in sport, has had an effect. In particular, a recent report by the Sports Councils Equality Group (SCEG), which said ""for many sports, the inclusion of transgender people, fairness and safety cannot co-exist in a single competitive model"" has given players like Hamilton concerns that they will be blocked from being part of football clubs that are central to their lives and well-being. It is a particular source of frustration for Hamilton, given that off the pitch she is a doctoral research student in ""the effects of testosterone suppression or supplementation on the athletic performance of transgender athletes"" - but says she and other scientists in the same area of research saw their findings ignored by a report she views as one-sided and not fit for purpose. She says: ""It went the same way as World Rugby, saying trans women are too dangerous to play in the women's category. They make the mistake of categorising trans women athletes as elite male athletes. That is not what you see in the clinical data, comparing trans women and cisgender men, they are nowhere near each other. ""They have ignored a lot of our research. We wrote a paper on this very topic, on trans women in archery and shooting, we talked about the process of safety and inclusion, and how you could do that with examples. This was completely ignored. ""One of the first lines of the SCEG report is 'no consensus could be found in the scientific community on this topic'. Hold the phone, we have the consensus of 70 of the world's leading sports medicine practitioners saying this is the route to go and you have just ignored it. ""It blatantly looks like they have taken one side of the argument and not balanced it off with the other, which is not the way science should be done."" Washington agrees, saying a golden chance to find an inclusive balance in British sport has been passed up in favour of giving renewed licence to the divisive rhetoric which characterises the transgender ""debate"". She says: ""It's a missed opportunity to really look at some of the ways in which we can improve inclusion in sport, it feels like a backwards step. There are many sports in the UK which have done really great work on inclusion for trans and non-binary people, and this really does not seem to pick up on that and move it forward. ""As the conversation around trans people's participation in sport has become more toxic, it is unsurprising that we see that playing out on pitches on Saturdays and Sundays up and down the country. People are consuming that narrative, and I think that gives people a licence to act up."" The divisive status of the SCEG report was further highlighted by new guidance from the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which confirmed there should be no assumption transgender athletes automatically have unfair advantage. Regarding the FA's own policy review for transgender footballers in England, John says they are working to make their rules as firm and fair as possible, and promised they would work with as many interested parties as possible. She said: ""We haven't mapped out the process in detail yet, we'll be working with our colleagues in governance, in the medical team, our research team. It will be a broad spectrum, the timeframe has not been mapped out yet. We will have partnerships with organisations like Gendered Intelligence, it will be broad in how we gather our information and form our policy. ""It is fair to say when applying our policy from 2014, it has been a successful application of case by case basis, which helps the FA remain fully sensitive to the needs of transgender participants, and that will be critical to bear in mind. In our review we will look at our policy and decide, is that the right approach? Does that still work, is it still relevant?"" Make Football Everyone’s Game. #TakeYourChance #RainbowLaces pic.twitter.com/lk476ZaRwd Webber is unconvinced by the SCEG and IOC reports and how much they realistically apply to trans sportspeople, and says the FAW will not be swayed from their support - even in the face of targeted online abuse. He says: ""I think you could question how much consultation has been done with all of those reports within the trans community, both within sport and those who are not in order to find out why not and what can be improved. ""From our perspective, our core is football for everyone, and we want out game is one where if you are transgender, you can be involved. Any barriers, or perceived barriers, need to be addressed. We know what those barriers are, they have existed for a long time. We are trying to lead the way ourselves, and not be governed, guided or forced by others in what we are doing. ""I've personally been targeted by anti-trans groups because of some of the work we're doing, but I'm fine with that. Over the last 18 months since I joined, some of the comments on our social media channels have been concerning, but I have seen and felt a shift in some of the attitudes towards the community, and I certainly feel the work we have done has had an impact. ""If all we are putting out is white straight non-disabled boys on all our comms, then people would not be represented in our game."" While Hamilton thinks little of the SCEG report as a scientist, as a footballer she admits the weeks since the report came out have been the first where she has actively considered whether she would be welcome on a football pitch. She says: ""From a personal point of view, after this report, for the first time I had the thought, should I go and play? Will I be welcomed? Will I be abused, attacked or heckled? ""I never usually think like that. I had to speak with my club about it, it put a lot of anxiety in my head, and has made me wonder if what happened at Bromley is going to start happening a lot more often. I know other trans female footballers who have felt very similar, it has put that seed of doubt in our minds. ""You think about the last year, with lockdowns but with sports teams allowed to train, for a good few months the only other people I got to see were the Hastings players, these girls have become like a family, we have these roots and bonds. And now this report saying I'm unsafe, with zero data from trans athletes, they are going to rip that away to be overly cautious. It's crazy. ""I have probably played 100 games in women's football and I have never once injured another player, never once been sent off. I've had games where I've conceded six, games where I have conceded none. Being assigned male at birth doesn't make a difference. ""If I was dominating the sport, would I not be up in the WSL? Scotland would be looking at me. They're not, and that tells you there are female footballers who can run rings around me and are much more talented. Sport is multi-faceted, and there is no magic wand to fix it."" Washington agrees that the potential loss of football for transgender people should the SCEG guidance be heeded could be devastating, and even more so for those who play at a lower and less competitive level than Hamilton - who, despite only playing in tier five of the English game, is among the highest level trans players currently active. Washington says: ""Football has been massively important in dealing with the difficult stuff that comes through transition, and building a new social circle, being on the pitch for a while and forgetting everything else that's going on, having some time away. ""I have thought about what might happen if I can't play, and know lots of others have had the same thought. ""If I can't play women's football any more, it's the end of me playing football. I have played football with men occasionally in a five-a-side kickabout, but physically I can't compete - I can barely compete with the women my age. Socially it wouldn't feel right either, like being forced to be someone I'm not again, and I'm done with that in my life. ""I also know it is putting people off getting involved; the ultimate losers in all of this are the trans people who self-exclude because they are worried they are not going to be welcome or think they will get banned, or have to out themselves in some rigorous process, and thus meaning they don't get the mental or physical health benefits, which is a real shame."" Asked about players feeling confident in reporting transphobia that they would be treated properly, John said: ""We view all discrimination as serious.  ""There is no sliding scale for one form of discrimination over another, we want it all to be absent from our game. We investigate any allegations of discrimination in a serious way to make sure we understand what has happened and take any action necessary. ""[Transphobia] isn't something we want in our game, we don't want anyone to feel that they cannot participate in a way that works for them. Rainbow Laces is broad, and we need to engage on multiple topics in that area."" While recent abuses and an uncertain future have put Hamilton and other trans footballers under immense pressure and scrutiny, she still regards her experiences in women's football as being primarily of feeling included, happy and belonging - with one memory from her time in Scottish football the particular standout. ""Dod Duncan, my old manager at Grampian Ladies, where I played before I moved south, something he said to me really rang through. After a game, he said: 'The one thing you need to realise is you're not Blair the transgender goalkeeper, you are Blair the goalkeeper, you are one of us'. ""It's a testament to the man, it's nice that someone can look beyond the thing everyone else is throwing their arms up about. To see me as the gender I align with, it really empowered me, and made me feel like he had massive belief in me. ""It's such a small thing as well; people ask, surely winning trophies or saving a penalty in a cup final must be your best experience, but it's the little things that count.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rainbow-laces-transphobia-british-football/blt52a3d9ca02720e30,Emma Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
516,'It's peace' - NWSL secures historic and badly needed CBA agreement after scandal-plagued 2021,"There were rare emotions flowing late Monday evening, feelings that had become maddeningly unfamiliar to anybody invested in the NWSL recently. Positivity. Optimism. Elation. Relief. All the result of the NWSL Players Association (NWSLPA) ratifying its first ever collective bargaining agreement (CBA). “This makes me feel so warm inside,” Kaiya McCullough, the ex-player who kicked off a league-wide reckoning last year said on Twitter. “I think it’s peace.” Indeed, the historic CBA averted a work stoppage on the eve of preseason and provided a desperately needed win for the league and its players after an autumn and winter of discontent. “We want a new, fresh NWSL, and the way to not relive the 2021 season and instead rebuild our league into what we know it can be, is to start from day one with a CBA,” NWSLPA executive director Meghann Burke told GOAL. “It’s something that everyone at the NWSL should be proud of,” Burke added. “It took a lot of collective work and effort and I think it really sets the NWSL on a positive trajectory for the future.” The unprecedented five-year agreement provides an essential level of stability and freedom to the NWSL’s players, many of whom have suffered indignities no employee – whether office worker or world-class athlete – should ever experience. The NWSLPA had been pushing for a CBA long before a cascading series of scandals in 2021, but those incidents added a new urgency to negotiations, and shaped what the PA prioritized. “I think the honest answer is that you can't untangle those things,” Burke said, referring to the reckoning over abuse in 2021 and CBA talks. “They were absolutely happening at the same time and on the minds of everyone involved.” Several of the provisions in the new CBA can be viewed as direct responses to the NWSL’s scandal-plagued 2021. A system of free agency has been introduced and while freedom of movement is something any pro athlete desires, it is especially vital in the NWSL after several players lamented the lack of an escape hatch when playing under abusive coaches. A boost in the minimum salary from $22,000 (£16,000) to $35,000 (£26,000) provides more financial stability to players on the bottom end of rosters – a group who, in several cases, were allegedly targeted by predatory coaches due to their lack of power and influence. And NWSL teams will be required to provide, among other medical personnel, a sports psychologist and team clinician to administer mental health services. Players will also be granted up to six months of paid mental health leave. Burke told GOAL that she believes this provision is the first of its kind in professional sports. “I think [the scandals] helped illustrate in a very human way why free agency was so important, why higher wages were so important, why players having more autonomy and control over their careers was so important,” Burke said. “[Having] up to six months paid mental health leave, there’s no better way to articulate why that's so important than to understand what happened last year.” In their press release announcing the deal, the NWSLPA included a poignant message to past players. Some had simply aged out, but others have been forced out due to abuse, inadequate pay, lack of career autonomy or substandard institutional support. “To the players who came before us: We stand on your shoulders. We hope we made you proud.” A statement from the Players Association: pic.twitter.com/7piQ0n9i0z Burke, a former pro player herself, said: “When we say we stand on the shoulders of those who came before us, it's a metaphor. ""But it's a fact that we would not be here without decades and maybe, if you go back that far, 100 years' worth of work and sacrifice, and players who never got to experience what the future generations will.” To be clear, the CBA is not some kind of magic elixir that will rid the league of the issues that have plagued it for years. Salaries are up but those on the lower end of the spectrum are still far from financially secure. Free agency provies freedom of movement for some, but not all. Investigations into alleged abuses are ongoing, with few tangible results as of now. There is still a frayed relationship between players and NWSL leadership that won’t be rebuilt by one CBA agreement. But suffice it to say, the last thing a beleaguered NWSL needed was a players’ strike to kick off a 2022 campaign during which it hopes to begin a long healing process. For the first time in a while, there is optimism about where the league is going.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/nwsl-secures-historic-badly-needed-cba-agreement/blt6f04a453d612bf6d,Seth Vertelney,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

563,"USWNT 2022 fixtures & results: SheBelieves Cup, Concacaf Championship & schedule in full","The U.S. women's national team put a difficult 2021 behind it in preparation for the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand next summer, where it will look to defend its title. In the first major tournament under Vlatko Andonovski, the U.S. underwhelmed, losing to Canada for the first time in 20 years in the semi-finals of the women's soccer tournament at the Olympic Games. Ultimately, the players did leave Japan with medals around their necks, beating Australia in the bronze medal match, but improvements were expected in 2022. The first fixtures for the USWNT in 2022 came in the SheBelieves Cup in February. Iceland, New Zealand and the Czech Republic were the three opponents for the U.S. this year, ranked 16th, 22nd and 24th in the world respectively. The tournament was not as straight-forward for the USWNT as some might have imagine, starting with a goalless draw against the Czech Republic, but Andonovski's side would go on to lift the trophy. The USWNT then played two friendlies with Uzbekistan in April, a nation ranked 45th in the world that failed to reach the final round of Women's World Cup qualifying in Asia, and a pair against Colombia in June in preparation for the CONCACAF Women's Championship in Mexico. The team went on to win that trophy, taking down Canada in the finale while not conceding a goal in the whole tournament. It also secured its place at the World Cup with its performances in the competition, as well as at the 2024 Olympic Games. Andonovski's side then closed out 2022 with a number of friendlies. It played Nigeria twice in September to kick off that run, beating the African nation on both occasions. The world champions came unstuck against England at Wembley, however, losing 2-1 to Sarina Wiegman's side and then lost to a heavily-depleted Spain team just a few days later. Defeat to Germany in November meant the USWNT had lost three games in a row for the first time since 1993, but a win over the same opponent just a few days later at least allowed this team to close out an up and down year on a high. Andonovski's side will be in action for the first time in 2023 in January, when it plays a double header against New Zealand and has an opportunity to scout out the venues it will play its Women's World Cup group stage fixtures at. Plenty more action will follow for the team throughout the year, including that huge tournament in Australia and New Zealand, with the eighth edition of the SheBelieves Cup also to come.

715,'We only knew when UEFA put it on social media!' - Inside Portugal's crazy qualification for the Women's Euros,"""Did you see that you’re going to the Euros?"" That Andreia Jacinto’s mother saw the confirmation of Portugal’s participation in the 2022 UEFA Women’s Euros before the midfielder sums up the chaos surrounding the Seleccao's qualification. Moments later, the 19-year-old was celebrating with friends having seen the announcement herself on television.  After not thinking about the tournament for months, following defeat to Russia in the play-offs over a year prior, suddenly Portugal had just 65 days to prepare for what promises to be the biggest Women’s Euros yet. It was April 2021 when Francisco Neto’s side were beaten over two legs by just a single goal, a result that had every player in tears.  “We knew that we could have done better in that play-off,” Jacinto tells GOAL. “Our goal was so close and we couldn't reach it. It was devastating.” However, in February, UEFA confirmed that Russia would not be allowed to compete in the Euros – one of the many sporting sanctions it has been hit with following the country's invasion of Ukraine. As those who failed to qualify for Euro 2022 were waiting to find out who would replace them, none waited quite as anxiously – or hopefully – as Portugal, the team Russia had defeated and the one with the best record of the sides that had failed to qualify. It would be three months until the decision was communicated – three long months of trying not to get their hopes up, while also focusing on World Cup qualification. Even things like end-of-season vacations had to be scheduled just right, just in case.  Jacinto made sure to plan hers for early June, while for Ines Pereira, the Portugal goalkeeper, her season would end on June 6, giving her just six days off in the end. Behind the scenes, the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) also needed to plan just in case the national team was to be given Russia's spot. They’d need the right friendlies to prepare, to think about camps and lots more. It was early May when the doubt was erased and plans could be properly put in motion. Pereira found out in quite a different way to most.  While the majority of her international colleagues had other team-mates around them, given all but two players in Portugal’s squad are based in their home country, the goalkeeper lines out for Servette in Switzerland. “We only knew when UEFA put it on social media,” she explains to GOAL.  Of course, taking Russia's place also meant being in the same group as Switzerland. “Right away, my team-mates started asking about Portugal and saying they are going to win,"" she continued. ""It's a good competition between us. I'm looking forward to playing against them and ensuring that Portugal is going to win. “It is a dream come true for me because the last time Portugal was at the Euros [in 2017], I was in the under-19 national team and I stayed at home, watching the games. “I called my family right away. I said, 'Portugal are going to the Euros and I'm going to work to be there'. “They congratulated me and the team and they said, 'The hardest part, it's already done. Now it's the easiest part because the hardest part is to go to the Euro.' ""Now, we have to enjoy it but work hard to be the best version of us.” The Netherlands, the reigning champions, and Sweden, many people’s favourites, are also in Portugal’s group, but the Switzerland game will understandably be special for Pereira. Meanwhile, Jacinto, another of the 10 players in the squad that has never played at a major tournament, will be relishing another. “I really like to watch [Vivianne] Miedema play and we are going to play against the Netherlands in the group stage,” she says. “I just really want to play against her. She's such a complete player, then she finishes so well.” It’s certainly a difficult group, even without the short notice confirmation of qualification. But maybe it will work in Portugal’s favour. Perhaps this team, who beat a fancied Norway side in February, will be underestimated. “People don't really expect something from us,” Jacinto believes. “We are just going to do our best and maybe we can surprise. “I think that the team really became more together [after the Russia defeat]. Failures are really important to grow, on the pitch and also mentally. Mentally, I think that we have really improved.” “You can see that in the Euro qualification, we got 19 points,” Pereira adds. “Some teams are at the Euros and they got less than that. “You can see that Portugal are a team that is really hard to beat. We only conceded two goals [in qualifying]. We have to score more, but if you don't concede a goal, you are closer to winning the game.” Here are 23 players who didn’t think they were going to play at a major tournament this summer, 10 of whom have never done so. After a crazy few months of waiting and wondering, they are not going to let this chance pass them by. “I think it will be encouraging to know that maybe some people think that Portugal is a team that only goes to the Euro because of Russia,” Pereira says. “But the truth is that we are going to show what we are, and we are going to try to do our best.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uefa-social-media-portugal-qualification-women-euros/blt02640addb3e32722,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
720,Houghton & Kirby named in England's provisional UEFA Women's Euro squad but Nobbs out through injury,"England head coach Sarina Wiegman has named Steph Houghton and Fran Kirby in her provisional squad for the UEFA Women's Euro, giving both the chance to prove their fitness ahead of the tournament. The 28-player group was announced on Tuesday afternoon and will be cut to 23 in mid-June, with that final list of players to represent their country at a home Euros. The Lionesses will play three friendly matches in preparation for the tournament throughout June, facing Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland before kicking off the competition at Old Trafford against Austria on July 6. The inclusions of Houghton and Kirby are the most notable, given neither have played for their club for several months. Kirby has been struggling with a fatigue related problem since February but has made good progress on that front, training all of last week with Chelsea in the build-up to their Women's FA Cup final with Manchester City, which they won in extra time on Sunday. Kirby was an unused substitute at Wembley, making the Blues' squad for the first time in three months. ""I don't want to put any pressure on her because I love that kid and she's been through a lot, but she looked like she hadn't even been away,"" Hayes said. ""She looked that good in training and it was nice to see the smile on her face."" Houghton, meanwhile, has not played since January and had surgery on an Achilles problem the following month. The doubt surrounding her participation this summer was highlighted by Wiegman's decision to confirm Arsenal defender Leah Williamson as the captain of the national team going forward. ""The past 12 months have been very difficult from a football perspective, in trying to overcome a number of injuries,"" Houghton, England skipper since January 2014, wrote in a statement after the decision was announced. ""Sarina and the England staff have been hugely supportive but with the injuries, I understand and respect Sarina's decision to name a new captain. ""For me, I don't feel my England story is complete and I continue to work hard with my rehabilitation in trying to make the squad for this summer's home European Championship."" Another noteworthy inclusion is that of Chloe Kelly, the Manchester City winger having made her return from an ACL injury in April and been in superb form since. Sandy MacIver and Lucy Staniforth are also back in the squad after some time away. One of the stand-out absences in the team is Jordan Nobbs, the Arsenal midfielder who was ruled out for the final weeks of the Women's Super League season after picking up a knee injury at the beginning of May. On Tuesday, the Football Association confirmed that she has now been ruled out for the summer and will therefore miss the Euros. It's more disappointment for one of the country's most talented footballers, who was cruelly denied a place at the Women's World Cup just three years ago because of an ACL injury. Speaking upon the announcement of this provisional squad, head coach Wiegman said: “The Euros are getting closer, and this is a big step towards the tournament. We have a settled squad and I know we have players in our team that will give everything to make it a summer to remember. “It is important the players have the chance to get some rest now after a very busy season before we get back to our work. We then have a series of prep camps coming up and it is important we use this time to build an even closer connection on and off the pitch. “We also look forward to welcoming those who have been working individually and with their clubs on their fitness in the past few weeks. We are hoping to have them back on the pitch when the series of prep camps start, so we can see where they are at.” England's first pre-tournament friendly is on June 16 against Belgium, with a game against Wiegman's home country, the Netherlands, to follow on June 24. The Lionesses' preparation will finish with an away fixture against Switzerland on June 30.

727,2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup: Who are the coaches of the 12 participating teams?,"The 2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup is ready to rumble from January 20, 2022. This will be the 20th edition of the quadrennial international football tournament in Asia. The competition has been expanded to 12 teams this time which would see more teams competing for the Asian title. The championship will also act as the final stage of Asian qualification for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Five teams will qualify for the main event directly while two of them will progress to the inter-confederation play-offs.  Japan are the defending champions of the Women's Asian Cup, having won it in 2018. However, China and Australia will be looking to dethrone the Nadeshiko. India have qualified by virtue of being the host nation. Mumbai's Football Arena, Navi Mumbai's D.Y.Patil Stadium and Pune's Balewadi Stadium would host all the games of the competition. Let us take a look at the head coaches of each of the 12 participating teams.  The Swedish manager took over the reins of the Indian women's national team in August 2021.

734,'I don't regret a word' - Souness refuses to take back 'man's game' comments after criticism from Lionesses,"Graeme Souness has refused to backtrack on comments he made during Sky Sports' broadcast of Chelsea's fiery 2-2 draw with Tottenham on Sunday, despite receiving criticism from Women's Euro 2022 winner Bethany England and Lionesses legend Eniola Aluko. During his analysis of the hotly-contested fixture, Souness controversially remarked: ""It's a man's game all of a sudden again"". Souness was later criticised for his words by Aluko and England, with the latter telling him to 'get in the bin'. After his initial response to the controversy sparked further backlash, he has since released a statement saying football is ""for everyone to enjoy"". The former Liverpool boss insisted that he did not have any regrets when asked about the incident on talkSPORT. “Not a word of it,"" he said. ""Let me explain. I’ve been advocating for years that the referees have such a major part to play in the success of the Premier League. “We’ve got to be careful what we say today and I’ve not been very good at that, but we were becoming like other leagues. “They were blowing the whistle all the time and it wasn’t a good watch. Our game has always been unique, more meaty, more in your face and more intense and we got away from that. “My comments yesterday were saying we’ve got our game back. That is the kind of football I remember playing in. “I enjoyed two games of football yesterday where men were playing men and they got about themselves and were falling out with each other.“ After initially failing to backtrack on his comments, Sky Sports eventually released a statement from Souness in which he claimed that 'football is a game for everyone'. ""To clarify my comments from yesterday, I was referring to the two Premier League matches I watched live on Sunday afternoon, rather than the sport of football,"" he wrote. ""Football is a game for everyone to enjoy."" Graeme Souness has issued the following statement: pic.twitter.com/cASVCpLl5S It was little surprise that a notoriously fierce competitor like Souness approved of Sunday's London derby.

754,Portland Thorns defender Kelli Hubly on her journey from temporary player to NWSL mainstay ,"Kelli Hubly has spoken to GOAL about her rise to prominence in the NWSL, which has taken her from believing her career was over after a traumatic college experience to starring for one of the league's best teams. Hubly is about to begin her sixth year in the league, and has become an integral part of the Portland Thorns after entering as an unheralded national-team replacement player in 2017. But Hubly almost never reached the pro level, revealing last year that she played under a coach in college who nearly drove her to quit the game entirely. Amid a reckoning in the game over abusive coaches last year, Hubly took to Twitter to share her own story in December. Hubly said that in college at the University of Kentucky, her coach called her ""lazy"" after she failed a fitness test and suspended her from the team, though it later turned out she had an autoimmune disorder called Graves' disease that held her back physically. ""A lot of people still don't know that about me,"" Hubly told GOAL on All of US: The U.S. Women's Soccer Show. ""And when I posted that they were like, 'Wait, what? I had no idea.' ""It was a good time to share my story. Everyone coming out this past year is giving people support that they can come out as well. ""I felt alone and I want people to know that there are other people who have gone through this. You're not alone. It's not embarrassing. ""I wanted to help other girls who've gone through it. Like see someone come out the other end on top, and [know] there is a light at the end of the tunnel. You can still achieve any dream you want to after going through that."" Though she entered the league as an unheralded player, Hubly managed to stick with the Thorns and has developed into a key defender for last season's NWSL Shield winners. But after Hubly left the University of Kentucky and transferred to DePaul University in her hometown of Chicago, she simply wanted to rediscover her love for the game. After sitting out a year she starred at DePaul and, though she went undrafted, she landed a short-term deal in Portland when the Thorns were in need of reinforcements with players away on international duty. ""My first year I just went [to Portland] and was like, 'OK, I'm going to try, if I hate it, I'll leave.' ""I needed that first year here not being rostered to grow into the player I wanted to be. I still needed to get my mind working again, because it was hard not doing anything for a year. ""At that moment, I don't think I ever saw myself being where I am today. But I also knew I had a lot of potential that I'd never even tapped into. ""So I feel really fortunate to have landed in a place where they have helped me grow. They've given me the freedom to find who I am as a player and embrace that. And each year I feel like the ceiling just keeps getting taller – there is no ceiling for me.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/portland-thorns-kelli-hubly-journey-nwsl-mainstay/bltbedbb4a8f9bed612,Seth Vertelney,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

774,Abramovich has been forced out of Chelsea - Are Man City and Newcastle's owners next?,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shone a spotlight on international funding in the United Kingdom, with sport a particularly visible and prominent vehicle of investment. Oligarchs and wealthy Russians close to Vladimir Putin have been sanctioned by the UK government and the ownership of Chelsea made Roman Abramovich the highest-profile case. With assets frozen, the club's existence was under threat and only a special licence allowed the men's and women's teams to continue playing. However, we are now moving towards the final stages of a takeover, which is being overseen by Raine Group, and there are at least four bidders in the mix. Of course, Abramovich, who has owned Chelsea since 2003, has been blocked from benefiting financially from the sale. The billionaire faced sporadic criticism about his links to the Kremlin during almost two decades at Stamford Bridge, but was still free to invest as much money as he pleased in Chelsea, who won five Premier League titles and two Champions Leagues during his stewardship. However, the Premier League has now come under pressure to expand its criteria for assessing prospective owners, particularly in relation to human rights. “We’re looking to see if more tests need to be added, if we need to be more transparent and whether those decisions should be approved by an independent body,” Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said at the recent Financial Times Business of Sport Summit. Roman Abramovich has been disqualified as a director of Chelsea by the Premier League. While there has always been scepticism surrounding the motives and practices of several American investors, the biggest political and moral objections have been made in relation to Middle Eastern involvement. For example, Amnesty International renewed calls for a human rights-compliant owners' and directors' test following the takeover of Newcastle United by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. Its chairman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been accused of presiding over a regime that has led a coalition in the long-running armed conflict in Yemen, as well as instigating a major human rights crackdown. Other Gulf states have invested heavily in sport, including 2022 World Cup hosts Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, which have both been condemned for their human rights records. Manchester City owner and UAE deputy prime minister Sheikh Mansour has spent more than £1 billion ($1.3bn) turning the club into one of the most successful in the world. However, Labour MP Chris Bryant, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Russia, questioned if he was a ""fit and proper person to be owning a football club"". Despite criticism, the UAE has also fostered close ties with the UK, which makes any potential intervention difficult. Indeed, in September, the UAE announced a £10bn investment partnership with the UK government on technology, infrastructure, and energy transition. ""The British government actively encourages investment from the Middle East – it has done for a long time,"" Geopolitical Economy of Sport expert Professor Simon Chadwick tells GOAL. ""In terms of business and lucrative sources of revenue, we know that the likes of Saudi Arabia and others spend lots of money on, for instance, weapons. ""Post-Brexit, the British government has obviously had to plug some gaps in terms of trade relationships and inward investment. ""And, over the last two or three years in particular, the British government has really doubled down on its selling in the Gulf region. ""In the main, the relationship is reasonably good without being exceptionally good. There are some issues. ""One thinks particularly of the scrutiny that the ruling family in Dubai have recently had in the treatment of some of their female family members. ""But there has also been some outcry from Britain regarding the war in Yemen."" A recent meeting between Sheikh Mansour and Syrian president Bashar al-Assad drew comment with a Foreign Office spokesperson saying such meetings ""undermine the prospect"" of peace in Syria, where a civil war has been fought for 11 years. The UAE has also so far remained neutral over Russia's invasion of Ukraine despite pressure from the United States and Europe. ""Whilst the UAE will not want to disaffect Europe and the West, it will equally not want to disaffect Russia either,"" Chadwick adds. ""They're going to hedge and wait and see before they make a decision. ""Whilst we're expecting Abu Dhabi to support Europe and the United States, they've also got to try to protect themselves as well. ""They are acutely aware that literally a matter of tens of miles across the Persian Gulf, they have Iran – a big ally of Russia and also a serial provocateur in the region. ""It's a dangerous part of the world and you can imagine the UAE trying to position themselves as intermediaries in the debate between Russia and the West."" Sport has helped promote UAE on the world stage. Abu Dhabi hosted last year's Cricket World Cup, as well as the engrossing final race of the 2021 Formula One season. Emirati citizens have also played a major role in transforming horse racing in the UK. Football, of course, has been the UAE's most visible marketing tool, with the Dubai government’s Investment Corporation-owned airline Emirates sponsoring Arsenal’s stadium, the FA Cup, Real Madrid and Chelsea amongst others. The City Football Group, in which Silver Lake and China Media Capital now have significant minor shareholdings, has Manchester City as its jewel and contains 10 clubs across the world including a foothold in potentially major markets in New York, China and India. Accusations of 'sportswashing' – the practice of using sport to clean a tarnished reputation or public image – has often been touted as one of the driving factors behind Middle Eastern investment. OFFICIAL: Newcastle United’s Saudi Arabia-backed takeover has been completed 💰 pic.twitter.com/epraQN17ue However, Professor Chadwick believes that financial benefits and an increase in soft power are bigger motivating factors. ""If you look at the national development strategies of Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Qatar, Bahrain, the national development strategies of these countries are centred upon generating incomes from overseas investment projects,"" he says. ""They are about positioning themselves as important members of the global sporting community, diversifying their economies away from a dependence on oil and gas. ""It's about affecting societal change, for instance, by promoting gender equality through sport. ""It is also about projecting soft power and that's an attractive power because it's essentially about trying to engage overseas audiences with who you are and what you do, and trying to persuade other nations that you want the same things as they do. ""Many people in the Gulf region would see this as soft power projection, not as sportswashing. I think sportswashing is simply a lens through which some nations view what is happening in these countries. ""That lens is obviously one which casts the likes of Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia as using sport negatively, for divisive and possibly even destructive reasons. ""I'm not discounting the possibility that this is the case. However, I do think there is more to what is happening in these countries than simply trying to convince the world that they're good guys."" Whatever the truth, one thing is clear: there is now greater scrutiny than ever before on where the money is coming from in English football.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-abramovich-english-football-man-city-newcastle-next/bltc26632032a17da4e,Jonathan Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

798,From unsuccessful trials to scoring against Barcelona aged 32: The ‘insane’ story of Jordan Clark,"Usually, when you glance up at the jumbotron during a game at the Johan Cruyff Stadium, home of Barcelona’s all-conquering women’s team, the list of goalscorers almost exclusively features the names of the European champions' biggest stars. Ballon d’Or Feminin winner Alexia Putellas has netted 14 times at the venue this season. UEFA and FIFA’s 2017 Player of Year Lieke Martens has hit 10 goals. Jenni Hermoso, the all-time leading goalscorer for Barca and Spain, has six. In October, though, for 11 minutes, there was just a single name on the board – and it was on the away team’s side. It remains the only time a team has taken the lead against Barcelona this season and it was the first goal they’d conceded in the 2021-22 campaign. The name up there? That of Jordan Clark, a 32-year-old playing her third match as a professional footballer. In the end, Barca would emerge victorious against Deportivo Alaves, winning 9-1. When the full-time whistle went, Clark looked up at the electronic scoreboard. She was outnumbered by that stage, but she was still there. “I saw my name and took it in that I'm in their stadium, on that field and had that kind of moment… All of that just kind of hits you in a wave,” Clark tells GOAL. “Everything I've fought for and had blood, sweat and tears for on the way over here, for it to lead to something like that, scoring against the best team in the world, and being the first in the season to do so, is just insane.” 17'⏱ | 0-1⚽️ ¡¡Gol gol gol de Clark!!#BarçaAlavés #GoazenGloriosas 🦊 pic.twitter.com/sbcFlRGngz Two months before that goal, she had landed in Vienna on her 32nd birthday to chase her dream of being a professional footballer. Achieving that ambition has been difficult. When Clark graduated from college in the United States, the country's top league had folded, so there wasn’t a college draft to enter. An opportunity in Germany didn’t turn out to be the springboard she’d have hoped. Clark returned home and went to as many trials as she could afford for several years, but it’s a demanding process, particularly while she was trying to keep her and her fiancé financially stable as he worked his way towards being a pilot. In April last year, she was settled into a full-time job and had bought a house with her partner. Then, in August, an opportunity to go to Europe and chase that dream presented itself again. Clark threw herself into it. “This is just something that's been burning out of me since I can remember,” she says, noting the “massive impact” the United States’ iconic 1999 World Cup-winning side had on her desire to become a professional player. “I grew up following Michelle Akers, Mia Hamm, and that definitely sparked a ton of inspiration. That was absolutely where I think I got my drive from. “I don't even know if I knew that there was really a pro league. I was just like, 'I want to do what they're doing. That's super cool.'"" She left a family holiday to fly to Austria and, after impressing in a trial that included a game against Bayern Munich, the feedback was pointing towards a contract. “Unfortunately, in the end, it came down to it being complicated with a foreign transfer from the U.S. and some budget issues,” Clark says. “To me, it was looking like, 'Yes, yes, yes!' I thought for sure it was going to be a go. Then, at the last second, it was like, 'Oh, no!'"" Clark was stuck in Vienna. Sola Abolaji, a former pro himself, was putting feelers out for another trial while she stayed with his friend, but things weren’t looking good. Last week we got you the fantastic story of Clark who with help from CMG @emasar3 gets to live her dream , playing in the Spanish league. Now the girl just scored a goal! Against Barcelona! This is a true fairytale. pic.twitter.com/FOgZveQRyR “I was on the phone with Sola and he was like: 'I have called everyone. The transfer window is narrowing, our timeline is closing. I've tried, there's just nothing out there right now. I think it's going to have to be time to go home',” Clark remembers. “He said those words, and I kid you not, he's like, 'Hang on, I'm getting a call right now. I have to take this.'"" On the other end of the phone was Ella Masar, a former U.S. international who played for Paris Saint-Germain, the Chicago Red Stars and the Houston Dash, among others, before moving into player representation. She knew of an opportunity with Madrid CFF, the team that finished seventh in Spain’s top flight last season. They wanted a defensive midfielder, Clark’s position. She flew straight to Spain but, to her surprise, found herself playing at full-back in a trial match against Real Madrid. Despite it going well, the club realised they needed to fill that position instead. “I didn't actually have anything in the wind for after that,” she recalls. “They even asked me, 'What are you going to do now?' I'm like, 'I don't know. I have no idea.'"" Masar kept ""working her magic"" though and Clark was on her way to Alaves within two days. It was there she would finally get her break – a reward for never giving up, thousands of miles from home. It’s been going very well, too. The newly-promoted team are tenth in the league, well clear of any sort of danger, and were at one point just six points off a Champions League spot. There’s clear ambition within the club when it comes to the women's team and performances are encouraging. In a way, it makes sense that Clark ended up with this team, their underdog statuses aligned perfectly via a crazy path. They both possess ambition beyond what people may expect, too. “I would love to battle for a Champions League place if we can make that happen,” Clark says. “I've never known if I was going to get this opportunity, but I want to see where I'm capable of going in the time that I have left. ""I'm not even sure of the potential but I would like to make it as high as I can. Playing in a Champions League game, at some point in my career, would be just phenomenal. “I've known that this is always what I wanted. As much as you still question after hearing no, after no, after no, I felt deep down like it was something I could do. That I had the capability, if I was just given a real shot.” She’s certainly making the most of that shot now.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/unsuccessful-trials-scoring-against-barcelona-aged-32-insane/blte8999f59ee4d4412,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
818,Lionesses star Kirby keen for 'surreal' Euro 2022 fever to energise England support,"England forward Fran Kirby says the team hope they can continue to help the nation celebrate as they angle for a first major final in over a dozen years, with the Chelsea attacker admitting it has been a ""surreal"" experience as Euro 2022 fever grips the nation. A year on from the pan-continental Euro 2020 men's tournament seizing hearts and minds on home soil as the Three Lions - de-facto key hosts - reached a maiden European Championship final at Wembley Stadium, the Lionesses could match their compatriots when they face Sweden in Tuesday's semi-final at Bramall Lane. Sarina Wiegman's side mounted a sensational extra-time fightback to defeat Spain in the quarter-finals and Kirby is aware of the feelgood factor she and her team-mates are helping to contribute to, particularly amid a trying summer for the public, especially if they can go all the way. “If we get the chance to win in the semi-final and get through to the final, I think it will be incredible for people in this country to have something to celebrate and enjoy,” the forward was quoted by the Guardian. ""As much as we want to win, we want to put a smile on people’s faces. ""They may be going through a hard time in terms of the rising fuel costs and the cost of living right now. Hopefully we can give people an escape for 90-plus minutes when they turn their TVs on, they will have something to cheer about and will see how passionately we play for this country. ""Hopefully it gives them a sense of pride and they can switch off from everything that is going on. It’s a bit surreal when you’re just walking down the street and people are out the windows clapping you. Hopefully it means that we’re making people proud and we’re inspiring them and showing them what women’s football can do in this country.” It's going to take a good team to stop England at #WEURO2022 🔥 pic.twitter.com/4Io4Jh4SLL A year after Gareth Southgate's side slipped to penalty shootout heartbreak, their counterparts - a prolific last-four major tournament presence under Wiegman's predecessor Phil Neville, yet unable to make that penultimate step to the final - are in a familiar semi-final position. Kirby is aware England's spectacular group stage results set expectations, but the attacker is hopeful they can deliver on them, adding: “It’s a difficult one because we have been here before and done this previously so you could say there is that expectation there. For us, and me personally, I know how tough tournaments are and how difficult it is. I wouldn’t say there is an expectation from us to get there, even if people expect it from us.

824,What does England's Arnold Clark Cup triumph say about the Lionesses' chances of winning the Euros?,"When the Football Association set up the Arnold Clark Cup, it was to prepare England for this summer’s UEFA Women’s European Championships. Olympic gold medallists Canada were invited. Eight-time European champions Germany joined them on the guestlist – as did Spain, a national team on the rise. After six games, it was England that emerged as winners, drawing with Canada and Spain, before beating Germany 3-1 on Wednesday night. How much did this tell us about the Lionesses’ chances of winning the Euros? It’s hard to know. The first few months of head coach Sarina Wiegman’s tenure has consisted of World Cup qualifiers in which her team hasn’t conceded once, but has scored 53 times. This, then, was the international window where her team would really be tested, facing three nations ranked among the world’s top 10. There have been real positives. The first half performance against Canada was exhilarating and worth the stir it caused among the England fans. Unbeaten ✅ Beaten a bogey team in the process 🇩🇪Eyes now heading towards the Euros 👀The @Lionesses have won the @ArnoldClarkCup 🏆🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 pic.twitter.com/qRsmqJmOh6 The double pivot partnership of Leah Williamson and Keira Walsh – one of the things Wiegman wanted to test out the most in this competition – was key, with Lauren Hemp electric out wide. In the clash with Spain, Wiegman made nine changes. Playing the strongest opponent in the tournament, it was a team few expected – but when the XI took to the pitch, the idea behind it became clear. Pressing, harrying and running themselves into the ground, they didn’t allow Spain time on the ball. They disrupted the rhythm of a team that, when in full flow, is pretty difficult to stop. During the 2019 Women’s World Cup, Wiegman was one of few coaches to come out with a genuinely effective plan to stop the U.S. women’s national team, who were eventual champions. This was a friendly, but it was a glimpse into the tactical nous she can bring to England. In the final match against Germany, her tactical tweak was certainly a little more English. With the scores 1-1 as it ticked into the last 10 minutes, centre-back Millie Bright went up front and, two minutes later, scored. After Fran Kirby put the gloss on the scoreline in stoppage time, Bright posed for a picture alongside Spain’s Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas and the Golden Boot they would share. A moment none predicted would happen, it was also a glimpse into England’s shortcomings, which it was also important for this tournament to highlight. The Arnold Clark Cup was a low-scoring affair for all, but there will still be concern about the lack of goals from the forward areas in this England side. “It doesn't really matter who scores the goals as long as we score a goal,” Wiegman said earlier this week, before adding: “We want to do better in our final third and that's about decision making, about connection, about scanning how the situation is too, and then being ruthless.” Reflecting on this tournament win for the Lionesses is also not complete without the caveat of the strength of two of the elite opponents they faced. Germany were massively limited, missing at least 17 players, and were under-strength and without key experience – although still a good side. Canada weren’t at their best either, with head coach Bev Priestman warning before the tournament that they wouldn’t be “perfect”. “I think there is a reality that 50 per cent of our team just started pre-season in North America,” she said. England could only play what was in front of them though, and they still got plenty out of this past 10 days, including a trophy. “I think we have been able to try out things, to see players in different positions and to develop our style of play against three opponents, but also three different styles of play,” Wiegman said after her team’s triumph. “That’s really good to see.” What does this mean for England’s chances for the Euros, then? In truth, we probably won’t know until the tournament kicks off in July, but it has highlighted plenty of strengths and weaknesses for Wiegman ahead of the big kick-off. “I am happy with this tournament - but we got lots of information about ourselves and where we are in our style of play,” she added. Now, she and her team have just over four months to do the work needed to take advantage of this opportunity to learn. That will be the next crucial step before they can think about turning the Arnold Clark Cup into a major tournament title.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-arnold-clark-cup-triumph-lionesses-chances-winning/blt57f5122c143c474a,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
857,Pele congratulates Saudi Arabia women after winning first ever match,"The Saudi Arabia women's team won their first ever international match when they beat Seychelle's on Sunday. Saudi Arabia ran out 2-0 winners in the friendly in Maldives. The team was established just last month and travelled to Maldives this week to play matches against the host nation and Seychelles. Monika Staab's team took the lead just 14 minutes into the tie when Al-Bandari Mubarak found the net. They went 2-0 up early in the second half when Maryam Al-Tamimi scored a penalty. Saudi Arabia coach Staab said after the game: “Our goal is for the players to gain the experience necessary to play international matches, in addition to our aim for our official entry into the FIFA classification.” The Saudi side will face Maldives in their next match on February 24.

873,'We are going to spend' - New U.S.-based Lyon owner claims he can match PSG's financial influence,"Lyon's American investor John Textor says that he believes his club can go toe-to-toe with Paris Saint-Germain as he says he intends to spend in an effort to compete in Ligue 1. Lyon have not won the French title since 2008, while PSG have established themselves as the dominant club in French football.  But, despite finishing seven spots and 27 points behind the Ligue 1 winners, Lyon's new owner believes that his team will soon be able to take down their free-spending rivals. ""I don't like these models like PSG,"" Textor said at a news conference. ""Great team, whatever, great athletes, we all love to watch them. ""I think over the few years we want to go after them. We want to win titles here. We are going to show up and we are going to spend."" He added: ""We can have as much capital at play in our football club as the Emir of Qatar."" Textor is a businessman that was formerly the Executive Chairman of fubo TV.  The American promised big spending as part of his purchase, which saw him promise a cash injection of €86 million ($90 million) as part of a deal that valued the club at around €800 million ($840 million). The purchase also included Lyon's dominant women's team, which has been crowned European champions in six of the last seven seasons, as well as the club's stadium. With the purchase, Lyon joined Textor's portfolio that also includes Crystal Palace, Brazilian club Botafogo and Molenbeek in Belgium.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/new-us-based-lyon-owner-match-psg-financial-influence/blt8e3c17bae695e514,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
884,From Hegerberg's impact to Bayern's spirit: What we learned from the Women’s Champions League,"Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, Wolfsburg and Lyon were confirmed as the final four in the 2021-22 UEFA Women’s Champions League this week, after the completion of the second legs of this season’s quarter-finals. A world-record attendance for a women’s game watched the first game on offer, 91,553 turning up at Camp Nou and being treated to a thrilling Clasico. That spectacle would be a tough act to follow, but Thursday’s action didn’t disappoint, with plenty of drama as the last of the semi-finalists were revealed. Here are some of the things we learned in the process... After an exciting 5-2 win for Barca on Wednesday, the recipient of the Player of the Match trophy would be the same talented winger as last week, when the Catalans beat Real Madrid 3-1 in the first leg. Caroline Graham Hansen has been one of the game’s best players for a few years now – last year, one could make a strong case for only her Ballon d’Or-winning team-mate, Alexia Putellas, having had a better season. Yet, as Putellas collected that award, the Norway international's name wasn’t even nominated. Directes als llibres d'història pic.twitter.com/YuKLYMsF8N That she continues to be omitted from the shortlists for these individual prizes doesn’t bother her in terms of searching for personal glory – not while she is winning trophy after trophy with her team. However, it continues to be unjust that the best wide player in world football is not often recognised as so. After working so hard to pull a goal back late on in a disappointing defeat in their home leg against Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich’s chances of getting the victory they needed in France were dealt an almighty set-back before the second leg even kicked off. The German club were missing seven players because of Covid-19. Their bench was bare – two of their four substitutes were goalkeepers, all were under the age of 19 and only two had played for the first team before – for a combined total of 36 minutes. Lyon vs PSGBarcelona vs WolfsburgThe Women's Champions League semi-finals are here 🍿 pic.twitter.com/HrLZmrKGD9 The performance Bayern put on, then, was incredible. They were 2-1 winners on the night in Paris, taking the tie to extra time. It’s the first time PSG has lost at home in 90 minutes since March of last year, to French rivals Lyon. It was also the first time a team other than Lyon had managed that since Wolfsburg, seven years ago. The lack of fresh legs would inevitably hurt them, with PSG substitute Ramona Bachmann winning the tie for her team, but what Bayern did was truly impressive. With the spirit and talent they have, mixed with the club's ambition, there is exciting potential in this team. As Wolfsburg beat Arsenal on Thursday, Svenja Huth ran the show. She’s been one of the most consistent performers at the top level over the last few years, but to watch her perform like that also reminds one of how her talent isn’t talked about anywhere near as much as it should be. As a German player, she’s not alone in that sense. There were no players from or based in the country on the Ballon d’Or shortlist last year, despite Bayern dethroning Wolfsburg domestically and reaching the Champions League semi-finals. In 2018, after Wolfsburg had reached the final in Europe, only losing to Lyon after extra time, only one of their players was nominated. Jill Roord's goal against her former side helped Wolfsburg advance to the Women's Champions League semi-final 👀 pic.twitter.com/fPz5YkEUzI This season, German teams have flexed their muscles in Europe – Hoffenheim hammering Arsenal, Wolfsburg doing the same to Chelsea and Bayern beating Lyon. With teams like Bayer Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfurt growing and investing, it’s a league with a bright future, too. Sadly, it’s a league that isn’t so widely broadcasted, though. That is likely a large part of why it flies under the radar and it’s a shame, because there are so many players and teams that deserve to be showered in more praise. When Lyon endured their first trophyless campaign in 15 years last season, it was down to many reasons. Ada Hegerberg’s absence was one of them. The first ever Ballon d’Or Feminin winner made her return to action back in October, after 21 months out injured, and has already scored 12 goals since – including the opener on Thursday night as the French club overturned a 2-1 deficit in the second leg of their quarter-final against Juventus. She’s one of the world’s best but it’s not just on the pitch that she galvanises this team. Speaking to GOAL after ranking at No.6 in this year’s NXGN list, Lyon’s teenage defender Alice Sombath explained how the Norwegian brings “joy” to the dressing room with her character, too. After last year’s disappointments, the seven-time European champions are into the semi-finals again and in pole position to reclaim their league title. New head coach Sonia Bompastor is a big reason why they’re getting back to their best, but Hegerberg’s impact certainly shouldn’t be overlooked either.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/hegerberg-impact-bayern-spirit-women-champions-league/blt6861317fe5e2eddd,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
893,Neville loving life in America as ex-England boss eyes long Inter Miami stay,"Phil Neville says that he is loving life in Florida as head coach of Inter Miami, with the former England women boss admitting that he hopes for ""longevity"" in his position at the MLS expansion outfit. The former Manchester United defender linked up with the Fort Lauderdale-based outfit - part-owned by onetime Class of 92 team-mate David Beckham - last term, and guided them to an 11th place Eastern Conference finish in his first year in charge. Yet the ex-Lionesses supremo has no plans to go anywhere in the future and says that he has aspirations to help build the club's fortunes over the coming years, stressing that he and his family have gone all in on embracing their life stateside. “We are committed, we don’t go half measures,” said Neville, at a launch event for the new MLS season. “We’ve got no house or property in England, there’s nothing to come home for apart from family. “We love living in the US and we as a family, and me personally, want this to be a success. I want longevity in this role. I think there’s nothing better than a manager in place for a long time. ""That’s what longevity means and I think that breeds success. I want to be successful and I want to repay the faith that David and (co-owner) Jose (Mas) have put in me.” Despite several glowing signings and high hopes for quick success, Miami have arguably underperformed against expectations over their first two campaigns in MLS, and Neville is aware that their is ground to be covered. “We had to send a strong strong statement because the first two years for this franchise weren’t good enough, weren’t acceptable from the top down to the very bottom,” the 45-year-old added. “So we had to make major changes to get what we wanted. I think last season taught me an awful lot and probably the thing I learned the most was this league is the hardest thing in the world too win.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/neville-loving-life-in-america-as-ex-england-boss-eyes-long/bltc703b13b983c0fa0,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Jonatan Giraldez’s side have, led by talismanic captain and Ballon d’Or Feminin winner Alexia Putellas, swept aside all before them this season to send records tumbling on a regular basis. A faultless Primera Division campaign saw them surge to title glory, while also savouring cup success and reaching a European final, but have they enjoyed a perfect season?

941,Women's FA Cup prize fund to increase to £3m per year,"The prize fund for the Women's FA Cup has been increased to £3 million ($4m), the Football Association (FA) has announced. The increase will come into effect in the 2022-23 campaign, with the funds being spread across each round of the competition. The commitment comes as a result of the increased profile and commercial interest in the FA Cup and the FA's desire to invest more across the women’s professional and grassroots game. The FA has promised that a disproportionate amount of the new prize money be given out in the early rounds of the competition so that teams lower in the pyramid will see the benefits of the investment. The FA's director of women’s football, Sue Campbell, said: ""I’m delighted to be able to make this announcement of increased funding for the Vitality Women’s FA Cup because it’s going to benefit so many clubs across the women’s football pyramid. ""The FA Cup, whether men’s or women’s, is the biggest and best domestic cup competition in the world, and this increased investment from The FA highlights that we want clubs competing in it to be rewarded, while also highlighting our ongoing commitment to the women’s game. ""Women’s football continues to be in a growth phase and we are always looking to make improvements and investment to drive it forward and break new boundaries. This is certainly one of the most pleasing during my time with the organisation, because I know it means so much to so many.""

969,'Let the pretty ones play in bikinis' - Germany's first female agent explains how she beat sexist comments,"Jasmina Covic broke through the glass ceiling in 2014 when becoming the youngest and only female agent in the German football business. Today she runs the Women’s Football Agency – the first of its kind to specialise in women’s football consultancy – alongside Brian Eylert, who once worked with iconic figures such as Lothar Matthaus and Nadine Angerer. It has been a long road to this point, but every obstacle put in Covic’s path – from narrow-minded sexism to stereotypes in the sporting agency world – have been cleared in groundbreaking fashion. Speaking to GOAL and SPOX about her initial efforts to work with a men’s football agency, Covic said: “I contacted a few. “However, I either didn't get any feedback or received a disapproving response like: 'Nobody is interested in women's football anyway'. ""An agent once said to Brian: 'What do you want with that? Let the pretty ones play in bikinis and lock the ugly ones away.' “People like that are now suddenly also involved in women's football, the great women's experts, and some even call themselves women whisperers. That made me smile a bit.” Covic is working hard to break down barriers and level playing fields, but concedes her life is still made more difficult than it should be by contradictory approaches within the male and female games. She said: “With women, there is a huge fight for sponsors, supplier contracts and equality. You fight for everything, so to speak. It is much easier for an average male Bundesliga player than for an average female Bundesliga player. “One of our national players is the only one without a supplier contract. Adidas says they don't have the money, but when I hear that an average male player can go shopping with the whole family, and even the agent, at the expense of the supplier, I don't know what to say. “We have always worked closely with Puma because they were the only brand that supported women's football. Now they have the problem that the players are being poached by Adidas and Nike.” On the advice that is offered to female footballers, Covic said: “Some of the players don't care if the advice is bad or if they have no significant experience in women's football. “Men come in expensive cars and fancy brands and tell them how rich they are and which famous men they have already worked with. That impresses the girls. This makes them fall for people who have nothing to do with women's football. Some players and parents are way too naive. “A German female national player once thought it was great that she became the first woman to work with a big men's agency. Yet they have never worked with a woman and have no idea whatsoever. Some of them just make you shake your head.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/covic-sexist-bikini-comments-groundbreaking-agent-women/bltdec6042713c84b8a,Stanislav Schupp,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1007,"SheBelieves Cup 2022 rosters: USWNT, New Zealand, Iceland & Czech Republic squads in full","The U.S. women's national team and the SheBelieves Cup return in February, with the hosts welcoming the Czech Republic, Iceland and New Zealand for this year's tournament. The 2022 edition of the round-robin competition will see games played in California and Texas, with the winner to be the team sat top of the standings after each nation has played each other. It will be the first action of the year for all four sides - though the U.S. did have a training camp in January - and it begins on February 17. Vlatko Andonovski's first squad of the year certainly grabbed attention, with star names like Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, Christen Press and Tobin Heath all missing. The head coach justified this in his press conference announcing the squad, explaining that he wants to give opportunities to some of the younger players coming through - such as Sophia Smith and Ashley Sanchez - for this SheBelieves Cup camp. Trinity Rodman was expected to be included after a standout season in the NWSL in 2021, but was only called up as a training player, with Andonovski emphasizing the desire to bring her into the team slowly. However, on February 7, defender Abby Dahlkemper pulled out due to a back injury and Rodman was brought into the playing squad properly. Goalkeepers: Aubrey Kingsbury, Casey Murphy, Alyssa Naeher. Defenders: Alana Cook, Tierna Davidson, Emily Fox, Sofia Huerta, Kelley O'Hara, Becky Sauerbrunn, Emily Sonnett. Midfielders: Morgan Gautrat, Lindsey Horan, Rose Lavelle, Catarina Macario, Kristie Mewis, Ashley Sanchez, Andi Sullivan. Forwards: Ashley Hatch, Mallory Pugh, Margaret Purce, Trinity Rodman, Sophia Smith, Lynn Williams. Player to watch: Sophia Smith One of the most exciting young forwards in the world right now, Smith settled well into her first full senior season with the Portland Thorns last season, scoring seven goals in 22 games. The U.S. will be heavy favourites for each of their games at the SheBelieves Cup, so will be expected to do plenty of attacking. Smith will be integral to that and could be one of the tournament's most dazzling players. Just five members of the Czech Republic squad that will travel to the United States do not play their club football in their home country. Goalkeeper Barbora Votikova plays for Paris Saint-Germain; Katerina Svitkova is in England with West Ham; Klara Cahynova represents Sevilla in Spain; and both Kamila Dubcova and Andrea Staskova play their football in Italy, with Sassuolo and Juventus respectively. Sparta Prague forward Lucie Martinkova is the most capped player in the team's history, having reached a century of appearances back in 2019. Goalkeepers: Olivie Lukasova, Alexandra Vanickova, Barbora Votikova. Defenders: Petra Bertholdova, Anna Dlaskova, Jitka Chlastakova, Lucie Jelinkova, Michaela Khyrova, Katerina Kotrcova, Simona Necidova, Gabriela Slajsova. Midfielders: Klara Cahynova, Franny Cerna, Kamila Dubcova, Tereza Krejcirikova, Aneta Pochmanova, Antoine Starova, Katerina Svitkova, Tereza Szewieczkova. Forwards: Klara Cvrckova, Lucie Martinkova, Miroslava Mrazova, Andrea Staskova. Player to watch: Andrea Staskova A rising star in the Czech Republic, Staskova was the top-scorer in Czech league in the 2018-19 season and Juventus didn't hesitate to sign her off the back of that. With the Italian giants, she has made a seriously good impression, boasting an excellent scoring record despite not being the team's first choice striker. At 21 years old, she is only going to get better, too. Iceland announced its roster for the tournament on February 4, with Thorsteinn Halldorsson's squad containing players from six different leagues. Eight of the 23-woman roster is based in Iceland, with the rest in England, Germany, Norway, Sweden and the United States. The most familiar names to fans in the U.S. will be Dagny Brynjarsdottir, the West Ham midfielder who spent three years in the NWSL with the Portland Thorns, and Gunnhildur Yrsa Jonsdottir, who currently plays for the Orlando Pride. Goalkeepers:Sandra Sigurdardottir, Cecilia Ran Runarsdottir, Telma Ivarsdottir. Defenders: Hallbera Gudny Gisladottir, Glodis Perla Viggosdottir, Sif Atladottir, Elisa Vidarsdottir, Ingibjorg Sigurdardottir, Gudrun Arnardottir, Asta Eir Arnadottir, Natasha Anasi. Midfielders: Dagny Brynjarsdottir, Gunnhildur Yrsa Jonsdottir, Agla María Albertsdottir, Alexandra Johannsdottir, Selma Sol Magnusdottir, Karolina Lea Vilhjalmsdottir, Karitas Tomasdottir, Amanda Andradottir, Ida Marin Hermannsdottir. Forwards: Berglind Bjorg Thorvaldsdottir, Svava Ros Gudmundsdottir, Sveindis Jane Jonsdottir. Player to watch: Glodis Perla Viggosdottir After five impressive years with 12-time Swedish champions FC Rosengard, Glodis Perla Viggosdottir joined Bayern Munich last summer and has settled well in central defense. The 26-year-old has top level experience that will be particularly important when Iceland face the USWNT and she is a goal-scoring threat at set pieces too, having netted three times in the league already this season. Jitka Klimkova, appointed head coach of the New Zealand women's national team in September 2021, announced her squad for the SheBelieves Cup on February 7. It includes Rebekah Stott, the popular and experienced defender who was diagnosed with stage 3 Hodgkin's Lymphoma early last year and has since undergone successful treatment. “She means so much to this team and we’re honoured to have her back,” Klimkova said. Goalkeeper Lily Alfeld is the only uncapped player on the roster, which includes 17 of the 22 players that went to Tokyo last summer for the Olympic Games. Goalkeepers: Lil Alfeld, Victoria Esson, Erin Nayler. Defenders: Elizabeth Anton, CJ Bott, Katie Bowen, Claudia Bunge, Abby Erceg, Meikayla Moore, Rebekah Stott, Ali Riley, Ashleigh Ward.

1024,Liverpool & Man City get 100 free buses for FA Cup semi-final after criticism of staging game at Wembley,"The Football Association has confirmed that the FA Cup semi-final clash between Liverpool and Manchester City on April 16 will take place at Wembley Stadium, but 100 free buses are being laid on for supporters following criticism of the decision to stage a meeting between two northern superpowers in north London. Questions had been asked of why two clubs from the north west should be forced to make their way down to the capital that weekend when a lack of train services would make getting to Wembley problematic. Semi-final encounters used to be held at venues such as Old Trafford and Villa Park, which would have been much easier for Reds and Blues followers to get go, but the FA has locked in a date at the home of English football and vowed to provide travel assistance to those intending to make a long journey south. The FA has revealed that the meeting between Liverpool and City will take place on Saturday April 16 at 3:30pm BST (10:30am ET). City’s women’s team are also due to be in last-four action on the same day as the men, with an outing against West Ham due to kick-off at 12:15pm BST (7:15am ET). Regarding the travel issues those in Manchester and Merseyside are facing, a statement from the FA on the organisation's official website reads: “We recognise the significant challenges that are being faced by some Liverpool and Manchester City supporters with train services being severely limited due to essential engineering works being carried out over the Bank Holiday weekend by Network Rail on the West Coast Mainline. “We are pleased to announce that a limited number of free return bus services will be provided for both the Emirates FA Cup and Vitality Women’s FA Cup semi-finals involving Liverpool and Manchester City on Saturday 16 April to support fans from the north west who wish to travel to and from London. Liverpool will play Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-finals 🍿 pic.twitter.com/GMGFrkYpEf “The FA will charter 100 buses from Anfield and the Etihad Stadium respectively to Wembley Stadium and back. This will ensure that up to 5,000 Liverpool and Manchester City supporters will be able to travel to Wembley Stadium free of charge for their semi-final tie. “We're also committed to providing a number of free return bus services for Manchester City Women supporters travelling from the north west to London. “These bus schedules are subject to availability, must be pre-booked, and the clubs will provide more information in due course. “In addition, we are working with our partners at National Highways to ensure that the road networks are running as efficiently as possible over the Easter period. Hundreds of miles of unessential roadworks will be put on hold to help supporters enjoy the occasion and enhance their journeys, and these motorists are encouraged to make sure that their vehicles are roadworthy before setting off.” The odd semi-final was held at Wembley prior to the venue’s costly reconstruction, with Paul Gascoigne netting a famous free-kick for Tottenham against arch-rivals Arsenal at an iconic stadium in 1991. Both last-four showdowns were staged at Wembley in 1993, when Spurs met the Gunners once again and there was a Steel City derby date between United and Wednesday of Sheffield. Once the ground had been given a serious facelift for the 21st century, the FA decided that all FA Cup semi-finals would be staged at their shiny new home from 2007-08.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-and-man-city-get-100-free-buses-for-fa-cup-semi/blt6d34fc19b48a8bbd,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

1085,Chelsea and England star Kirby out for 'foreseeable future' after suffering from fatigue,"Chelsea and England forward Fran Kirby has been ruled out for the “foreseeable future” after suffering from fatigue. Kirby has not played since February and this latest setback puts her participation at Euro 2022 this summer is now in doubt. Chelsea boss Emma Hayes said there is no “definitive reason” behind the fatigue and that more investigation is needed to reach a firm diagnosis. Speaking at a news conference previewing this weekend’s Women’s FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal, Hayes confirmed Kirby would be sidelined for some time. “There’s no chance of her playing at the weekend. She’s been taking some time in the background, she’s been suffering with a lot of fatigue. I don’t have a definitive reason why that is, we don’t know,” said Hayes. “I think, forget the athlete, [she’s] just a human being and she’s struggling and we have to get to the bottom of that. I don’t think Fran will be available for club and country until that happens.  ""I’m not withholding [information], because I don’t have anything to tell you, because we haven’t got to the bottom of it. Until we understand some of the underlying reasons for that fatigue, I’d just be speculating. “We’re going through a process of elimination to try and determine why she’s struggling. From my perspective, this isn’t the first time, it’s been ongoing for a lot of years. We need to give the time to find the right support so that we can come up with a diagnosis and then with diagnosis, you can come up with strategies. Right now, I don’t have any answers. What I know is that she’s not available for club or country and she won’t be for the foreseeable future.” Kirby has previously missed nine months of action after being diagnosed with a heart condition in November 2019. Responding to this latest setback, the former Reading player wrote on Twitter: “I'm sad that I have to write to you all another message like this. ""With this being an on-going issue throughout my career, it was time to put my health first. Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to message, I'm doing everything to try and come back once again. ""But until then, I will be Chelsea and the Lionesses biggest fan with you all."" Kirby has won 11 major honours with Chelsea since joining from Reading in 2015, including the domestic treble last season. She has also won 54 caps for England and was expected to play a key role for the Lionesses at this summer's Euros, which is being hosted in England.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-and-england-star-kirby-out-for-foreseeable-future/blta24eab6549cbc47a,Tom Mallows,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1103,From a meticulous approach to matching clothes: Why Germany always win,"A young Lisa Weiss remembers watching on TV as the Germany men’s national team made one of their regular trips to Frankfurt, which is customary whenever the country wins something special. They gather on the balcony of city hall with their silverware and show it off to the thousands of fans below who swarm the square to celebrate another national triumph. When Weiss was just 21 years old, she got to do that herself as part of the women’s national team that reigned supreme at Euro 2009. “You stand there and you think, ‘Wow, I'm here now! And I'm not watching this on TV!'” she tells GOAL, still lost for words at times when she replays the moment in her mind. As the goalkeeper recalls watching Die Mannschaft engage in the famous celebration, she is trying to remember the title they had just won in her memory. It’s fitting that she can’t put her finger on it, because there have simply been so many. After all, the men’s team has four World Cup trophies to its name, as well as three European Championships. The women have two World Cups, an incredible eight European titles and an Olympic gold medal. The success doesn’t stop there, either, as the youth teams have also won 30 major tournaments between them, the most recent of those coming in May when an eighth UEFA Women’s Under-17 Championship was added to the collection. It’s no wonder, then, that every Germany team goes into a tournament with a contender tag, even if they’re not at their absolute best – just as the women's team do for this month's Women's Euros.  At the end of the day, winning is what they do. The question is, though, how do they do it? It’s a simple question, but one with a lot of different answers. Shortly after Germany tasted defeat to Brazil in the 2002 World Cup final, the German Football Association (DFB) introduced its Talent Development Programme, an initiative that would set up almost 400 bases across the country to further develop young players. Over the last 20 years, this programme has been upgraded, tweaked and improved in every way possible, such is the DFB’s attention to detail.  That trait is one key factor in the association's success. Their meticulous approach is seen in the work it does with academies, amateur clubs and state associations to identify and nurture talent.  Another trait becomes evident while talking to Weiss about her experiences. Over 10 years ago, when the goalkeeper first started representing her country at international level, women’s football was not in the developed place it is today. And yet she remembers the quantity and quality of the staff around here. There were multiple physios, a full-time doctor, video analysts and more.  Even the presence of a goalkeeper coach may seem trivial, but it has only just started to become commonplace in even the women's game's most progressive countries. For so many years, Germany has been ahead of the curve. It has been forward-thinking and advanced in all that it has done, which is why the team has remained competitive at all levels for an incredible amount of time.  However, many other countries followed their lead and are now reaping the rewards. “We have reached a decisive turning point – we want to raise our training to a new level, as other nations have now not only caught up with us but also overtaken us,” Joti Chatzialexiou, director of the German national teams, tells GOAL. “[As for our winning mentality], we often discuss that we feel we are losing this quality a little bit. This is also a generational development, changing life circumstances. ""But always putting on the scale the qualities for which we are envied around the world is our absolute ambition. “Our teams have always been characterised by outstanding team spirit and the titles, especially with the Under-21 national team, have not always been won by the better individual players, but rather by the better team. We need to retain this strength.  ""However, we also want to develop more players with outstanding skills. Other nations are more successful in this matter than we are.  ""So, this is our aspiration as a great soccer nation: we want to get back to the top of the world!” That winning mentality is the stand-out trait when you think of Germany. It’s what gets its teams over the line so often, even when it is not at its best.  Chatzialexiou references the U21s Euros win last summer as a good example. The 2014 World Cup win is another. “We could only celebrate when we won!” Weiss laughs, remembering her days in Germany’s U23 team. “I remember we played the Nordic Cup final against the USA and we lost, and everybody was like, ‘Okay, but it was still good.' “But from the coaches, we got the feedback – it's not enough for us. We couldn't celebrate and have a drink together because the coaches said, ‘No, no, no, we have to win this tournament.' ""We wouldn't accept to lose and this was something that I learned in the national team, definitely.” It’s the reason she believes the women have had so much success, too, from her experiences working with one of its best ever teams. The Euro 2009 triumph she enjoyed was Germany’s fifth in succession. “I think it's the mentality and the drive of, ‘I want to win every game,'” she says. “We had a coach at the time, Silva Neid, who demanded a lot from the players and a lot from herself. “It was really the focus on, ‘I want to win every duel in practice. I want to win every little step.' This, I think, she put in our DNA.  ""We were also demanding a lot from each other. When there was a missed pass or something people would say, ‘Come on, let's go! What is this?’” “We trust that intrinsic motivation and being obsessed with success can tip the scales in favour of less talented teams within a match,” Chatzialexiou adds, noting the DFB’s emphasis on maintaining that mentality. “Therefore, these elements are enormously important to us.” “Sometimes, I felt we need to be a little bit more chill and not to be, I would say, too German – because we are very strict,” Weiss concludes.  “We are always on time. We have rules over rules over rules – in the national team especially. We wear the same clothes. If somebody has different shoes on, you have to pay a fine. “Sometimes, it's too much but also, I think these are things where you hold on to and this makes also a little part of your success. Maybe it's crazy for other people. “When I see the U.S. women's team, how they go, for example, to have lunch, they are dressed in everything, it doesn't matter. But then you see the Germans like they are in the military!” she laughs. “We all look the same. I think this is something that is special for us. I would like to have this a little bit more chill but maybe this is the key also of being successful – not only the clothes, but the rules of everything.” The matching attire might not be the secret to so many consistent and successful German national teams, but it sums up the mindset behind them all. There are things they need to improve to keep up with what is going on around Europe and the world, but while Germany has that mentality, you can never write them off.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-germany-always-win/blt7394b8d26e3e7b7c,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

1117,"Barcelona's title-winning women's team are an example for the men's team, says Xavi","Xavi has admitted that Barcelona's title-winning women's team are an example for the men's team. Barcelona Femeni secured their third successive Primera Division crown after thrashing Real Madrid in the Clasico on Sunday. In stark contrast, the men's Blaugrana side have not won La Liga since 2018-19 and are way off the pace in this season's title race, with Xavi acknowledging that the women are ""showing us the way"". Barca Women clinched the trophy with six games to spare while extending their 100 per cent record in 2021-22 with a 24th successive victory. Jonatan Giraldez's team have also scored 136 goals while shipping just six at the other end, and Xavi now ranks them among the best groups in the club's history. ""For several years [the women's team] have been showing us the way with how they play, how they compete and the hunger they have despite winning everything last year,"" the Spanish head coach told reporters. ""We have been watching them and it's a wonder to see them play. They are leading the way in the same way as the Dream Team did in their day or as Pep [Guardiola's] Barca side did later. They are an example for the men's team."" Barca's senior men's team have suffered early exits in both the Champions League and Copa del Rey, with Ronald Koeman axed from the managerial hot seat back in October due to the club's poor start. The Blaugrana's fortunes have improved quickly under Xavi, though, as a club legend has publicly expressed his determination to restore the team's lost identity. Progress has been made in the Europa League, and a place in the quarter-finals is awaiting Barca if they can bounce back from a 0-0 draw in the first leg of their round of 16 tie against Galatasaray when they meet again in Turkey on Thursday. That competition likely represents their only remaining chance for silverware, as despite a four-match winning run in La Liga that has seen them move back up to third, Real Madrid remain 12 points clear of their arch-rivals in top spot.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-s-title-winning-women-s-team-are-an-example-for/blt3c39059d217fb91d,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1142,‘Korean women’s football is moving backwards’ - Cho determined to take Asian Cup ‘opportunity’ with South Korea,"Cho So-hyun, captain of South Korean's women's national team, says she feels “ashamed of improvements” in women’s football at home, believing things are “moving backwards”. The midfielder will lead her team out at the Asian Cup this month, looking to deliver success after the country failed to reach the knockout rounds four years ago. Cho, who plays her club football in England with Tottenham, sees the tournament as “the best opportunity” to show how good her team can be, despite her feelings about the game in Korea. Speaking to GOAL in an exclusive interview, Cho said: “I feel ashamed of improvements of K-football because I feel like it's moving backwards since every Korean young pro player is moving abroad. “Young players who are playing elite and pro, the number is not really high. In the long term, I don't think it shows high improvement. “The women's football teams in Europe are highly improving, but compared to Asian leagues, the programme of training is absolutely different. “For the self-improvement [for Korean players], I recommend to go to European leagues. I'm not saying that Asian players are not good at playing soccer, but I want to say to improve the skills and improve the physical [abilities], to improve both ways, I think it's much better to go and play and experience a team abroad.” Cho is one of three Korean stars who play for a club in England, alongside Chelsea midfielder Ji So-yun and Brighton forward Lee Geum-min. Asked if she believes there is anything players like herself and her high-profile team-mates can do to help the situation at home, she said spoke about the structure around elite teams and the dense football pyramid that England has in comparison to Korea. “In England, the local soccer teams, they're always being competitive and that always helped them to improve more,” she explained. “If we have local soccer teams, it means that we can also improve the local financial stuff and so on. “The boys’ soccer teams in Korea, they have various types, from the amateur and the elite. They are trying their best to figure out which player do they have, but in Korea for the women's soccer team, I don't think they are trying their best.” Cho was speaking from the SingaCup, an event in Singapore that gives young boys and girls the chance to participate in several footballing activities. She explained one reason she got involved was to shine a light on how things are at home for young footballers. “I wanted to truly inform [people of] how the current situation in Korea is,” the 33-year-old said. “I was also wondering how the foreigners are looking at the Korean soccer team as well.” Cho and her team will have the chance to show the potential Korea has this month and how good it could be with more support, with the Asian Cup to kick off on January 20. Korea will face Vietnam a day later in their opening fixture, with Myanmar also in Group C with them, alongside reigning champions Japan. “I think this is the best opportunity that I have,” Cho said. “If I can get the girls far, it means I can show the power of an Asian women's football team. I really want to try my best for that.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/korean-women-football-moving-backwards-cho-determined-asian/blt5377ea9a83847c21,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

The Lionesses outclassed Sweden 4-0 at Bramall Lane to reach their first major final since 2009.  Beth Mead, Lucy Bronze, Alessia Russo and Fran Kirby were on target for the hosts to cap off a stunning victory against the second-ranked side in the world.  Wiegman was ecstatic after the win as England will now have a shot at the European Championship trophy against either Germany or France on July 31 at Wembley. She thinks that the convincing victory at such a crucial stage of the tournament will not only be an inspiration to the country but also a statement to their main rivals.

Substitute Russo's individual brilliance came to the forefront for England's third goal. Her initial shot was saved by Sweden's keeper Hedvig Lindahl. But she latched on to the rebound and produced an instinctive back heel which nutmegged the keeper to score one of the finest goals of the tournament.

1172,'This is my journey' - USWNT star Huerta on battling anxiety and helping the next generation,"As the national anthems played ahead of a clash between her two cultures, Mexican-American full-back Sofia Huerta found herself struggling with a familiar question: Who do I really want to be? This was back in 2013 in Washington, and Huerta had made her choice. She had chosen to represent the country of her father: Mexico. But, as the Star-Spangled Banner played ahead of a friendly against the U.S., Huerta couldn't help but think about who she really was. ""[Playing for Mexico] was a great experience for me. I got to play internationally at a really young age,"" Huerta tells GOAL. ""And it actually made me realise what I knew all along: that I actually wanted to play for the U.S. ""Hearing that American national anthem, I just thought, 'Oh, I just resonate with this more right now and that feels more true to me.' ""I love that I'm Mexican, that was just what my dream was... A lot of people were giving me their advice and letting me know that I made the wrong decision. I took it all with a grain of salt. ""This is my journey. I know what I can really do."" To understand the context of Huerta's journey, you need to understand the context of Huerta's upbringing. friday.gif pic.twitter.com/bdfIXXWgUp Her father, Mauricio, had emigrated to the U.S. from Puebla, Mexico, settling in Boise. And, for those that don't know, Idaho is neither a hotbed of Mexican culture nor a prime developer of soccer talent. And so Huerta had a different kind of upbringing, one that saw her connect with her Mexican roots even if few around her truly understood them. ""I think my whole life I've kind of identified with being Mexican-American,"" Huerta says. ""I think it was a different experience growing up in Idaho, which is obviously a more low-diverse area. ""And so I always knew that I was different."" Different she was. Huerta emerged as a multisport star in Boise, winning Idaho's Gatorade Player of the Year award twice in soccer. She caught the eye of Santa Clara University, one of the premier women's soccer programs in the country. By 2012, her sophomore year of college, she was playing for Mexico, having previously represented the U.S. at the U-20 level. The decision to play for Mexico, at the time, gave her a source of pride and a chance to represent her father and all of the family in his homeland. In December 2014, after a period of soul searching, she announced she would not continue to play for Mexico. The switch, ultimately, took nearly three years. After that wait, Huerta had hopes that it was her time, her chance to finally seal her spot on the USWNT squad. But, after just seven caps, she found herself out of the picture. It was at that time that Huerta felt most alone. After several seasons in the NWSL that saw her bounce from position to position with the Chicago Red Stars and Houston Dash, she embarked on two loan spells to Australia, far from home and seemingly further away from her national team dreams. Nowhere near the USWNT and with her time as a Mexican international long gone, Huerta had moments of regret. Huerta looked back on her initial impressions with the USWNT and believed she'd squandered her chance. She looked back at all of the times where she didn't give as much as she could have . She'd heard the criticism from those that said she never should have left. She remembered everyone who told her she wasn't good enough for the USWNT. And, at that time, she started to believe them. ""Personally, I doubted my viability a lot during those years,"" she said. ""I had a lot of regret in terms of how I acted during my time with the national team. ""I feel like I wasn't as professional as I should have been. I wasn't doing everything I could to make sure that I was getting called in every time. ""In the years where I wasn't getting called in, you have to really sit with those feelings, and that's really uncomfortable. I really don't wish that upon anyone. ""I would kind of regret what I did in the past and then I would get anxious about the future and whether I was ever going to get the opportunity again, and that was not helping me at all. In fact, it was actually hurting me, I wasn't playing to my best ability and I just wasn't enjoying what I was doing. ""That was something I also had to kind of think about like 'I'm a professional soccer player!' Just because I'm not on the national team doesn't mean that I'm not a badass and that I hadn't made it this far. I had to change the narrative."" That, Huerta says, is still a process that is ongoing, even if circumstances have changed massively since those years in the wilderness. She's worked with a life coach since she has left college, and she believes that taking care of her mental health in that way has helped propel her to where she is now. The 29-year-old defender has become an important piece at OL Reign, one of the NWSL's top clubs. Having previously played just about everywhere on the field, including striker, Huerta is now one of American soccer's top right-backs. Huerta is also back with the USWNT, a key figure as they head into the CONCACAF W Championship. After all of those years of waiting, Huerta has now featured in five of the USWNT's eight matches so far in 2022. The success is a long time coming, but Huerta knows it can all go away in the blink of an eye. ""[Seeing my life coach] isn't something that you do for like a week and then like your life has changed,"" she says. ""I'm personally, always, every day growing. ""Like, it may seem like I know everything that I'm doing and that I don't have performance anxiety and that I play so many games so I'm fine. No, every day challenges me. Every day is something new. ""One day can be great and the next day, it's not so great. I think the main idea and point is that a lot of things are out of your control and all you can really do is have a short-term memory and move forward. ""A lot of people don't really talk about their mental health because I don't think people are really aware of anxiety or whatever it is and that's something I've always been super hyperaware of, and I think that it's really just helped me in all aspects of my life."" All these years later, Huerta has developed a bit of perspective. She realises that, in some ways, she was one of the lucky ones. ""Being from Idaho, I just was not at a place where I was seen or had exposure or was given many opportunities in terms of getting recruited and seen by college coaches,"" she says. ""If you're from like California, you're being seen every weekend from like some of the top colleges. ""For me, particularly that was not the case. Being Mexican-American did also get in the way. I feel like even when my club team would go on trips, my family, unfortunately, could not afford for me to go on that trip, so I just wasn't getting the exposure. And that was something that was really, really hard for me. ""I had those thoughts about how I was playing with these girls and they're also good but, unfortunately, because of the lack of resources and quite honestly because we're from Idaho, they just weren't given the opportunities. ""That happens all over, whether it's monetary reasons or where you're from. A lot of people are missing out on such great opportunities."" With that in mind, Huerta has recently partnered with Signing Day Sports, a college recruiting platform that uses technology to help players that are out of focus, players like Huerta, get their chance in the spotlight. Signing Day recently expanded to soccer, with the platform allowing athletes from all over the U.S. to upload footage, answer interview questions and, most importantly, connect with college coaches. It's a platform that Huerta believes would have helped so many girls like her get seen by the right people. ""I really think about what it would be like if this platform was available to me when I was going through the recruiting process,"" she says. ""I think it would have made it much easier. ""I think it would have been great just to have this platform to interact with coaches and to put myself out there because I think a lot of coaches didn't see my value, which obviously affected my recruiting process. ""Even though I'm very happy with where my journey has taken me, I just think that this is such an important platform for people because it helps athletes get discovered and recruited by college coaches across the country, which is something that is not easy. ""A lot of people just aren't seen."" Huerta has earned her moment in the spotlight and, if all goes to plan, there's a chance she could earn a chance to play at the biggest stage. The World Cup is just a year away with the Olympics coming up in 2024, and Huerta has reason to believe she could finally get that chance. It would be a dream come true for Huerta, the Mexican-American girl from Boise that overcame a lack of exposure, her own anxiety and a battle within herself just to make it this far. But, before she can look ahead to those moments, her story has another very fitting chapter to be written. Coincidentally, the CONCACAF W Championship take place in Mexico as Huerta returns to face the country of her father. The USWNT's third match of the group stage will be against the hosts, perhaps putting Huerta against Mexico with a World Cup spot on the line. She'll hear those same national anthems that she heard nine years ago but, this time, she'll be on the other side. The side she truly wants to be on.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uswnt-star-huerta-battling-anxiety-helping-next-generation/blt079396f26c817347,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

1222,Will Ferrell sent Bale personal message telling him to join LAFC from Real Madrid,"Hollywood star Will Ferrell played a role in Gareth Bale's surprise move to Los Angeles FC, sending the forward a personalised message asking him to join the club. Ferrell is part of LAFC's star-studded ownership group, which also includes NBA legend Magic Johnson and former USWNT star Mia Hamm. Bale has added further glamour to the franchise, with the Welshman signing a 12-month contract back in June. Prior to agreeing to join LAFC, the former Real Madrid man had been linked with hometown club Cardiff City, but the club's ownership were successful in tempting him over to the United States. LAFC co-president John Thorrington explained the film star's role in the transfer during an interview with the PA News Agency. ""I can't remember exactly what stage in the conversation it was but he did receive a personal message from Will Ferrell,"" Thorrington said. ""We have an amazing group of owners, who are very committed to delivering on these lofty ambitions."" ""I will tell you the absolute, honest truth, until I saw a signature I never believed it would happen,"" Thorrington added. ""But everything trended positively throughout and it was a fairly linear process. It was sort of step by step. He had some questions and we would bring in that expert to talk about it - whether that would be our strength and conditioning staff, whether it was bringing an owner into the conversation. ""We just had probably five, six conversations, and I think each got us a step closer to the deal. We were a totally different opportunity and I was not surprised to hear there was competition in Europe. ""But I think what helped is Gareth's knowledge of LA, getting to know what the club offered, which was unique relative to the other options, and we were grateful that the stars aligned, and we're able to do."" Bale has got off to a strong start in MLS, netting twice in just 96 minutes of action so far and ending up on the winning side in each of his four league appearances. He netted a stunner for LAFC earlier this month, motoring past two Real Salt Lake players before cutting inside and firing a left-footed shot into the back of the net.

1245,'He was never a midfielder' - Inside Liverpool star Fabinho's forgotten Real Madrid loan spell,"Looking back, it was some 'B' team. It had Alvaro Morata leading the line, with Jese Rodriguez buzzing around in support. Denis Cheryshev played off the left, with Lucas Vazquez flying down the opposite flank.  In the middle the likes of Omar Mascarell, Borja Garcia and a youngster named Casemiro ran the show, while Nacho and Diego Llorente kept things tight at the back.  Yep, Real Madrid Castilla’s class of 2012-13 were pretty special alright. Most of them have gone on to enjoy stellar careers across Europe.  And this weekend, in the final of the Champions League, the Spaniards will run into perhaps the best graduate of them all. Fabinho was just 18 when he first arrived in Madrid. He was a tall, skinny full-back who had been whisked away from Fluminense, his first club, before he had made a single first-team appearance. Rio Ave, a modest club in the north of Portugal, had signed him. Nuno Espirito Santo, the former Wolves and Tottenham boss, was their manager, while Jan Oblak and Ederson, now two of the world’s best goalkeepers, were in the squad, along with Bebe, once of Manchester United. The teenage Fabinho would train with them briefly, but would be moved on loan to Castilla almost immediately. It was all part of the grand plan of Jorge Mendes, the super-agent most commonly associated with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and, of course, Jose Mourinho. Mourinho was manager of Real Madrid at the time, and Ronaldo was his star man. Fabinho, meanwhile, arrived in the 'B' team with little fanfare. Unknown and untested, one of Mendes’ many gambles.  Alberto Toril was the coach of Castilla that season, and remembers Fabinho fondly. “He was very shy, but you could immediately see his potential as a player,” he tells GOAL. “When he arrived, he occupied a somewhat strange position for the type of footballer he was. He was 1.90m (6ft 2in), but he was a right-back, which is unusual, no? “He played on occasion as a centre-back, but never as a midfielder. At the time, he just wasn’t seen as a midfield player, although we were not sure where his best position would be in the future.” Fabinho would make 30 appearances for Castilla that season, and would be handed his senior Real debut by Mourinho late in the campaign. He played 14 minutes as a substitute against Malaga in May 2013, assisting Angel Di Maria for the final goal of a 6-2 win at Santiago Bernabeu.  “Mourinho and his coaching staff had good regard for him,” Toril says. “They always asked about his evolution and were very attentive to his development. He was often involved in training with the first team.” Toril, who would later go on to manage Elche in the Spanish second division and now coaches Real's Femenino team, remembers being especially struck by Fabinho’s understanding of the game, as well as his personality and technical qualities. “He was eager to learn,” he says. “He was positionally very good and always made good decisions on the ball. You could see his confidence grow as the season went on.  “His team-mates loved him. He fitted in well with great players like Morata, Nacho, Casemiro, Lucas Vazquez, Jese. They were very young players at that time, but very prepared. “With Fabinho, we all saw that he had great conditions for the future. He played many games, and his behaviour was always of a good level. He was very consistent, attentive and generous. He played a lot of good games.” Castilla finished eighth in the Segunda Division that season, just ahead of a Barcelona B side which included the likes of Rafinha, Gerard Deulofeu, Sergi Roberto and Alex Grimaldo. They were the division’s top scorers with 80 goals, despite losing as many games (17) as they won. But while others from that side would get first-team chances – Casemiro, Nacho and Vazquez are all still at the club – Fabinho’s career would be made elsewhere. He joined Monaco in the summer of 2013, as Mendes began to load the Ligue 1 club with his clients, which included Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez, Joao Moutinho, Ricardo Carvalho and, later, Bernardo Silva. His development accelerated in France, though he was again seen predominantly as a full-back to begin with. It was only later, towards his mid-20s, that he emerged as a holding midfielder. He has since become one of the best in the business. “His evolution has been extraordinary,” Toril says. “He was always in great condition but he was young and had to evolve. “When he played for Castilla, Casemiro played in that position, so he had to go elsewhere to develop and evolve. “He is a top-class player. He has a great physical capacity, and uses that so well on the field. He is so good in possession, he always makes good decisions with just a few touches of the ball.  “Tactically, he is a very interesting player, always well positioned, very competitive and with a winning mentality. He was a pleasure to coach.” Fabinho, of course, arrived at Liverpool in the immediate aftermath of their last Champions League final with Real Madrid, joining from Monaco for £40 million ($52m) within 48 hours of the Reds’ defeat in Kyiv in 2018. Since then, he has become a European, World and Premier League champion with Jurgen Klopp’s side, establishing himself as one of the world’s premier midfield players in the process. He has shaken off a hamstring injury to feature in Paris this weekend, and is likely to be a key player as Liverpool look to win their seventh European Cup. Not bad for a lanky right-back, eh?",https://www.goal.com/en/news/never-midfielder-inside-fabinho-forgotten-real-madrid-loan/19v7cd2yjzzz717lwbs2d26x97,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

1285,Tributes pour in after Germany legend Uwe Seeler dies aged 85,"Germany legend Uwe Seeler has died at the age of 85. Seeler enjoyed an illustrious 21-year career that saw him remain loyal to one club, Hamburg, between 1952 and 1973. The former striker scored a staggering 445 goals in 519 games for Hamburg, and was just as prolific at international level with the German national team. Seeler found the net 43 times in 72 outings for West Germany and appeared in four World Cups, including as captain in his country's 4-2 final defeat to England in 1966. He is widely regarded as one of Germany's greatest ever players and remains Hamburg's all-time top scorer in the Bundesliga to this day with 137 goals to his name. Seeler is survived by his wife Ilka, with whom he had three daughters. His grandson, Levin Oztunali, currently plays in the German top-flight for Union Berlin. Hamburg board member Jonas Boldt released a statement paying tribute to Seeler on behalf of the club, which reads: ""We will never forget him and will always cherish him. ""Uwe Seeler stands for everything that characterises a good person: Down-to-earthness, loyalty, joie de vivre, plus he was always approachable. He is the epitome of HSV.""

1288,'I don't think I'll score one like that again!' - England star Russo amazed at her Women's Euro 2022 backheel goal,"England star Alessia Russo admits she'll likely never be able to produce a goal quite as daring as the one she scored in the 4-0 victory over Sweden in the Women's Euro 2022 semi-final. Russo converted a backheel flick that nutmegged the goalkeeper to put Tuesday's match away and send Bramall Lane into a frenzy. It was Russo's fourth goal of the tournament. She also netted twice against Northern Ireland and once against Norway. The Lionesses are now a step from their first-ever UEFA crown, and they can win it on their home turf at Wembley on Sunday. ""To be honest, I missed the first [shot of the move], we were actually working on cut backs in training the other day,"" she told reporters. ""Once it fell back to me I thought ‘what’s the quickest route for me to get this ball in the back of the net?’ Because I should have scored in the first place, I just swung a foot at it and luckily it hit the back of the net. ""I think [it was one of my best goals]. Yeah of course, to score in a semi final and progress to the final is a huge highlight of my career. I don’t normally score back heels and I don’t think you’ll see one again, I’ll take it for now."" On whether the audacious attempt summed up her confidence, Russo added: ""Yeah, I’m loving it so that helps with confidence. I think when you’re enjoying your football you play your best. Maybe it does show confidence but I’m just loving playing football."" The Lionesses will have the rest of the week to prepare for the final, where they will meet either Germany or France. England have been to two UEFA finals previously. They lost to Sweden at that stage in 1984 and fell to Germany in 2009.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-star-russo-amazed-backheel-goal/blt9be0f32d090a3781,Dan Bernstein,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Vlatko Andonovski's side are now well on their way to reaching the knockout stages, which would also see them qualify for the 2023 World Cup.

1315,Watch: USWNT book spot in Olympics as Morgan penalty kick seals win over Canada in CONCACAF W Championship final,"The U.S. women's national team missed chance after chance on Monday night in the CONCACAF W Championship final, but Alex Morgan eventually came up with the goal they needed to seal a spot in the Olympics. After missing several opportunities to seize momentum against Canada, Morgan scored from the spot in the 78th minute, sealing a 1-0 win that saw the U.S. take the top spot in CONCACAF for the ninth time. With the win, the U.S. qualify for the 2024 Olympics, having already booked a spot in the 2023 World Cup earlier in the tournament. HOW COOL CAN YOU BE, @ALEXMORGAN13 😮‍💨 pic.twitter.com/XCMXWaF8oh The USWNT were nearly made to pay for a slew of missed opportunities as the tournament favourites let their northern rivals hang around thanks to some wayward chances. The U.S. outshot and out-possessed Canada, generating several clear-cut chances to take the lead.  Until Morgan's late spot kick, though, those chances weren't converted, with the most glaring being Sophia Smith's miss in the 64th minute after rounding goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan. SOPHIA SMITH MISSES AN OPEN NET FOR THE USWNT. 😱 pic.twitter.com/n8JOqviUXF The penalty was earned by Rose Lavelle, who was dragged down in the box in what ultimately proved to be the game's decisive sequence. With the tournament triumph, the U.S. qualifies for both the Olympics and the World Cup as they look to regain their place atop the women's game. Canada will also be World Cup-bound, but will now need to face third-place finisher Jamaica for an Olympic berth. Jamaica defeated Costa Rica 1-0 earlier on Monday, with Kalyssa Van Zanten scoring in the 102nd minute to keep her country's hopes of a spot in France alive. With three goals, Morgan finished with the joint-most in the tournament, level with Canada's Jesse Flemming and Julia Grosso as well as Jamaica's Khadija Shaw. With the trophy in hand, the USWNT can now look ahead to friendlies later on in the year.  The only other matches on their schedule at the moment are a pair of friendlies against Nigeria, with the first match set for September 3 in Kansas City before a rematch three days later in Washington, D.C.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/watch-uswnt-book-spot-in-olympics-as-morgan-penalty-kick/blt724295117315efaa,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1362,FIFA 23: Will EA Sports release a new football game in 2022?,"Since 1993, EA Sports has been publishing FIFA-branded games, with the annual release of a new numbered entry becoming a near three-decade tradition. For the most part, FIFA has dominated its particular field, with their closest competitors, Konami’s eFootball (Formally known as Pro Evolution Soccer or PES), undergoing a branding and strategy shift in an attempt to compete with EA Sports' game once more. However, the future of the game remains uncertain as FIFA and EA Sports' partnership renewal appears to be doubtful, leaving fans unsure about the release of their new football video game. EA Sports has not yet revealed anything about their next football game, so it remains unclear whether there will be a FIFA 23 or not. However, it seems likely that the game will continue in one form or another.  Should FIFA 23 be released in 2022, it is expected to launch around the end of September, based on the release timetable of the previous year's game. While EA Sports and FIFA must come to an agreement which would see their partnership continue, their current deal doesn’t end until after the 2022 World Cup in December 2022. That timeline presents a dilemma for EA Sports.  While nothing has been confirmed, it appears increasingly likely that fans will still be able to play a new EA Sports football video game, which according to Xfire will include both a men's and women's World Cup as well as crossplay - a first for EA Sports' football game franchise. EA Sports FC has been widely reported as a potential new name for EA Sports' football game franchise. Trademarks for 'EA Sports FC' have been filed in the UK and EU, fuelling rumours that the famous FIFA video game series could be set for a name change. However, an official name change has not yet been confirmed.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fifa-23-will-ea-sports-release-new-football-game-2022/bltd290751e263e0de2,Nick Khairi,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1369,NBA star Kevin Durant becomes minority owner of NWSL club Gotham,"Two-time NBA Champion Kevin Durant has been announced as a minority owner of NWSL outfit NJ/NY Gotham FC, after the club confirmed an investment by the small forward's Thirty Five Ventures (35V) group. The Brooklyn Nets star, alongside business partner Rich Kleiman, become the third different party to take a stake in the club since March. Gotham, who last year reached the first round of the play-offs and the final of the NWSL Challenge Cup, are based out of neighbouring New Jersey to Durant's home turf, and Kleiman has said the pair are committed to forging success going forward. “As a New York-based company, the opportunity for us to partner with a forward-thinking team like Gotham FC was a no brainer,” 35V co-founder Rich Kleiman said in a club press release.  “There’s been so much growth in the NWSL in recent years, and the chance to be a part of that growth and work directly with the Gotham FC executive team and players is really exciting."" 35V joins Gotham FC’s Ownership Group.

1382,'This is perhaps the best England team ever' - Spain coach Jorge Vilda,"Spain head coach Jorge Vilda believes the England side that his team will face on Sunday afternoon is “perhaps the best England team ever”. La Roja drew their opening fixture of the Arnold Clark Cup on Thursday with Germany, picking up the same 1-1 result that England did later that same day against Canada. Speaking ahead of the second round of games, Vilda heaped praise on the hosts of the competition, predicting possibly “the best game of the tournament” when his Spain side face them this weekend. Talking about England in his pre-match press conference, Vilda said: “I personally believe that this is perhaps the best England team ever. They've got plenty of youth in the side, players who play with courage. “They've got players all over the pitch who can make a difference, particularly on the left wing and an excellent striker. Great players in Leah Williamson, Lucy Bronze, an excellent midfield. “It's a team that will put us under pressure early with the high press and when we get the ball in their half, they're a team that are quite adept at defending deeply to fluff out the opposition's threats. “Overall, I expect the game played at a very high pace, great intensity, just like the kind that you would see in the Women's Super League in England and also in the Spanish league too. I think it will be an excellent game and we are really looking forward to tomorrow. “It potentially could be the best game of the tournament, in my opinion.” Asked if there is anything he is afraid of, Vilda responded: “We’re not particularly scared of anything. “We know what their strengths are. We know they've got a lot of them, but we also know what their weaknesses are. These are the things that we've pinpointed in training and been watching in the footage of previous matches - and these are the things that we will try to exploit to turn the game and the result in our favour.” Spain midfielder Alexia Putellas, who won the Ballon d’Or last year, also spoke highly of Sunday’s opponents ahead of the game. “England are a great team, one of the best in the world. I always love playing against big teams like them,” she said. “We haven't always beaten them when we've played them. We haven't had that luck all the time. But tomorrow, who knows what will happen? I'm just really looking forward to the game and the challenge ahead. “I believe that we have improved a lot since [we last played England at] the 2020 SheBelieves Cup. We are a better team now. “Tomorrow will be a really tough test. It will be a really high-quality contest. We'll need to be at the top of our game to win. “We need to do the little things right. The minor details will make a massive difference tomorrow. Just like the other day, we need to go out there clearly with the plan that we've prepared in mind and execute it well. We didn't get the result that we quite wanted the other day with the late equaliser. “Just like Germany, England are going to come with a game plan and be quite resolute and difficult to break down and tough to beat. It will be a close game so we need to do everything we can. “We also need to play well and try to quieten down the crowd because there'll be a lot of fans on England's side, like there will be in the Euros this summer. That is exactly what we need to do if we're going to be on the right side of the result come the end of the game tomorrow.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/best-england-team-ever-spain-coach-jorge-vilda/blt0f4c810134881bb7,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1388,'I want to play at the 2022 World Cup'- Arsenal's NXGN star Flores eyeing Gunners debut and further Mexico honours,"It has been a whirlwind 12 months for Marcelo Flores. Arsenal’s teenage attacker was still playing Under-18s football this time last year, with his U23s debut for the Gunners not arriving until the final day of the 2020-21 season. But since then, he has not looked back. In a matter of months, the impressive 18-year-old has established himself as a key player for Arsenal's U23s, trained regularly with Mikel Arteta’s senior squad and also made his mark on the international scene. Flores was the star of the show in November when he scored two goals in three games to inspire Mexico U20s to glory in the inaugural Revelations Cup. His performances captured the imagination of a nation, with widespread calls for the teenager to be handed his full senior debut by Mexico boss Gerardo Martino soon following. And Martino answered those calls in December, when Flores was included in his squad for a friendly against Chile in the United States. The Gunners forward was brought on with seven minutes remaining of the 2-2 draw, capping what had been a remarkable few months for a player who does not even turn 19 until October. “Making my Mexico debut is a night I’ll never forget,” Flores exclusively tells GOAL during an interview to mark his inclusion on the NXGN 2022 list of the world's best teenage footballers. “All the players took me in well. Some of them were older, but I was really close with them and I trained really well. “To come on was a very special moment for me and my family. Thanks to the manager for giving me the opportunity.” As the friendly was not classed as a competitive international, Flores could still choose to represent Canada - the country of his birth - or England. A final decision has yet to be taken, although right now he admits his focus is firmly on Mexico. And for a player with lofty ambitions, the experiences he has enjoyed this season - both internationally and with Arsenal - have left him thirsty for more. “I would like to make my Premier League debut before I turn 19,” Flores says. “That’s my goal.” “And I’d like to get my proper international debut for Mexico and hopefully be involved in the Qatar World Cup. “I idolise players like [Lionel] Messi, [Cristiano] Ronaldo and Neymar, who have all done the same thing. “Looking up to players like them, you want to match what they did because like any player, my ultimate dream is to win things like the Champions League and the Ballon d'Or.” Born in Ontario, Canada, Flores cannot remember a time when he didn’t have a ball at his feet. Football has always been ingrained in his family. His father, Ruben, was born in Mexico City and played for Atlante in the Mexican Primera Division from 1988 to 1990. His mother also played and his two sisters, Tatiana and Silvana, now play for Chelsea and Tottenham, respectively, and have also represented Mexico at youth level. “I started when I was really young,” he says. “My dad always had a lot of his football friends around, so everyone loved football. “I started kicking a ball when I was really young and I never lost my love for it. I was a really energetic kid and playing football just made me happy. “Barcelona was my favourite club. My mum tells me that I never used to take off the shirt. “When I was young my dad took me to a couple of games at Camp Nou. I used to love Ronaldinho.” Flores’ early football memories are of him and his sisters leaving school early to rush back home and watch Champions League fixtures on TV. They grew up supporting Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona team, and would all pack into their front room to see their heroes in action. For Flores, it was all about seeing one man. “I idolised Messi,” he reveals. “For my sisters, it was Alexis Sanchez and [Andres] Iniesta. We just loved coming home and watching such a good team play. “I used to love those days when the Champions League was on. It’s such a good memory.” Growing up in Canada, Flores spent a lot of time playing his football at the Guelph Soccer Academy, where his dad was technical director. But his big break arrived in 2015, when he travelled over to the Cayman Islands with his father, who was coaching the women's national team at the time. While they were there, Flores took part in a soccer school being run by a man who scouted for Ipswich Town. His performances caught the eye, and he was soon invited for a trial by the English side. The young attacker impressed enough during his time in England to be offered a permanent place in the Ipswich academy, and eventually he and his family took the decision to all move to England permanently. “The first year was really difficult,” Flores recalls. “I was playing well, but being a Canadian kid, it was hard at first getting used to the English style and interacting with the English boys. “But I just stuck to my football and in the second year I put a lot of hours in as my dad became one of the coaches there. “So on Saturdays and Sundays I would be there all day, and after school I would be there as well. I was training really hard on my own and with the team and it ended up paying off. “I started doing really well and then a lot of options opened up.” Clubs across England were now on Flores’ trail, with both Liverpool and Manchester City keen to sign him But it was Arsenal who won the race for the young forward in 2018 after they mapped out the clear pathway to the first-team they saw for him at the club. So he moved to the Gunners’ famous Hale End academy and would spend his days looking at the pictures on the walls of players who had gone on to make their mark with the first-team at Arsenal. “Every day you go to training and walk past those photos,” he says. “That’s the ultimate dream, so every day you give the best you can to improve yourself because you know it can pay off. “It is an inspiration. Seeing players who have broken through shows you that there is a pathway and if you keep doing what you are doing, hopefully you can get there too.” It was not long before Flores started to make his mark at Arsenal. He was handed his first professional contract in July 2020, and made the move over from Hale End to the club’s main training centre at London Colney. After a series of eye-catching performances with the U18s, he got his chance with the U23s and has become an increasingly influential figure at that level since the start of the campaign. After waiting for his opportunity, Flores has started to flourish under new coach Kevin Betsy, and his performances have caught the eye of Mikel Arteta, who has invited the forward over to train with the first team on several occasions in recent months. “The first time I ever went, I was 16 or 17,” Flores says. “I really enjoyed playing FIFA at that time so suddenly training with all these players that I used to play with on FIFA was kind of surreal. “Obviously you get used to it, but at first it was really cool and you realise just how much better they are when you play with them in person. “Every time you go, you just want to show your best to the manager and the players, and that’s what I will keep doing.” 𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁 finish 💥𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁 celebration 🤯Take it away, Marcelo Flores 😎🇲🇽#AFCU21 | @PapaJohnsTrophy 🏆 pic.twitter.com/9l31HJmd9a Given his progress through from Hale End, it is no surprise that Flores has huge respect for what Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe have achieved during the past couple of years. He has developed a close bond with both, and is full of thanks for the advice he has received from them as he looks to follow in their footsteps. “Bukayo and Emile have been through what I’m going through now,” he said. “They understand and they take you under their wing, give you advice and help you out a lot. “Bukayo went straight through to the first team, which is amazing, but for Emile, who went on loan twice, it was a bit harder pathway for him. “But to see him come through now, get the No.10 shirt for Arsenal, which is my dream as well. It’s a big thing. “It shows if you put the time in it can pay off.” For Flores, the focus now is on finishing what has been a breakthrough season as strongly as possible. The 2021-22 campaign has given him a taste of what could be to come, but he is well aware that there is still much to do if he is to achieve some of the lofty targets he has set himself. The past 12 months, though, have certainly shown that anything is possible when it comes to Arsenal’s talented young forward.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/2022-world-cup-arsenal-nxgn-star-flores-gunners-debut-mexico/blt3c078530516fce25,Charles Watts,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

1452,'Male athletes don't feel safe coming out as gay'- USWNT star Rapinoe,"United States women's national team star Megan Rapinoe has said her male counterparts don't feel safe coming out as gay. Speaking about sexual identity in football, she said men ""feel like they're going to get abuse from fans"" if they reveal their true selves. Rapinoe has been at the forefront of social justice issues, including gay rights, throughout her USWNT and club career. ""To everyone in the sporting culture, you have a responsibility to think about what you're saying and ensure that you're creating an environment that's welcoming and open,"" Rapinoe said on The HangOut. ""We get asked all the time - why aren't there more out male athletes in elite sport? It's because they don't feel safe. They feel like they're going to get abuse from fans, they're going to be kicked off teams, have slurs thrown at them, whatever it is. ""It's safer on the women's side - we have a lot of camaraderie between ourselves and people coming out, which makes it easier for everyone. But I would say from sporting directors to club owners, to fans and players, it's your responsibility also."" Indeed, male players have said it would be difficult to be publicly identified as gay in a dressing room. Earlier this year, Patrice Evra spoke of the issue from his own experiences around team-mates who had not come out as gay. ""When I was in England, they brought someone to talk to the team about homosexuality,"" Evra told Le Parisien. ""Some of my colleagues said: 'It is against my religion, if there is a homosexual in this locker room, let him leave the club' and other comments. ""At that time, I said: 'Shut up'. I played with players who were gay. Face to face, they opened up with me because they are afraid to speak otherwise. ""There are at least two players per club who are gay - but in the world of football, if you say so, it's over.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rapinoe-male-athletes-dont-feel-safe-coming-out-as-gay/blt54fe545c623a89d1,Dan Bernstein,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

1475,‘The worst mistake of my life’ - USWNT legend Hope Solo pleads guilty to DWI,"USWNT legend Hope Solo has pleaded guilty to a charge of driving while impaired, with the former goalkeeper admitting that she has made the “worst mistake of my life”. The 40-year-old, who saw her national team contract terminated in 2016, was arrested in Winston-Salem, North Carolina on March 31 and charged with driving while intoxicated, resisting arrest and misdemeanour child abuse. Police reported that Solo was found passed out behind the wheel of her vehicle with the engine running in the parking lot of a Walmart while her two children were in the car, with prosecutors claiming that she refused to take a sobriety test. It was later determined that she was three times the legal limit to be driving. Forsyth District Judge Victoria Roemer has issued Solo with a two-year suspended sentence and an active sentence of 30 days, which is considered to have been served as time has already been spent in a rehabilitation centre. Solo has also been ordered to pay a $2,500 fine after surrendering her license and will be required to undergo a substance abuse assessment before completing a recommended treatment programme. Solo remains the most-capped player in the history of the U.S. Women’s National Team after representing her country on 202 occasions – with 153 wins and 102 clean sheets allowing her to collect two Olympic gold medals and a 2015 World Cup crown. She has been elected to the U.S. Soccer Hall of Fame, with her induction being deferred until 2023, and has said on social media of tarnishing her reputation away from the pitch: “It’s been a long road, but I’m slowly coming back from taking time off. “I pride myself in motherhood and what my husband and I have done day in and day out for over two years throughout the pandemic with two-year-old twins. “While I’m proud of us, it was incredibly hard and I made a huge mistake. Easily the worst mistake of my life. “I underestimated what a destructive part of my life alcohol had become. “The upside of making a mistake this big is that hard lessons are learned quickly. Learning these lessons has been difficult, and at times, very painful.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/worst-mistake-uswnt-legend-hope-solo-pleads-guilty-dwi/blte87cc9af332d3cc0,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

1501,"Barcelona smash own women's attendance world record as 91,648 fans attend Wolfsburg win","Barcelona have made women's football history once more after the Blaugrana broke the world attendance record for the second time this year - taking their own spot at the top of the history books in the process - with their Champions League rout of Wolfsburg. A rampant performance from the Blaugrana saw them emerge 5-1 victors over their visitors at Camp Nou, mere weeks after the team broke a two-decade-plus record to deliver the highest crowd figure for a women's football fixture this century, with 91,553 in attendance. That game - a Clasico with local rivals Real Madrid - looked likely to stand the test of time for the near future, but mere weeks later, the club have topped themselves with another eye-watering gate figure. Barcelona announced a new world record attendance of 91, 648 for their match aaginst Wolfsburg on Friday, with just shy of a hundred additional supporters more than the number posted against Madrid. It, by default, also takes the records for the most-attended club football game in women's football, as well as fixture in Europe.

1511,England sell out Wembley in 24 hours as all tickets snapped up to watch European champions face USWNT,"England's women have sold out Wembley Stadium in just over 24 hours as they prepare to face the World Cup holders, the United States women's national team (USWNT). The Lionesses will face off against the No.1 ranked team in the world in a one-off game following their 2-1 extra-time triumph over Germany on Sunday. The game is subject to England qualifying for the 2023 World Cup, as should they face a qualifier, the dates would clash and it would lead to it being rearranged. Tickets for England's October international against the USWNT sold out in 24 hours 👏 pic.twitter.com/d3K6d2mLG8 England's last two fixtures against the USWNT have both ended in defeat, losing 2-0 in the Arnold Clarke Cup in 2020, and a heartbreaking 2-1 defeat in the World Cup semi-finals in 2019. Head coach Sarina Wiegman was very excited about the prospect of facing such high-class opposition. She said: “It is really exciting to have the chance to play the U.S. at Wembley if we can make sure of qualification for the World Cup. “It would be the perfect game for our squad to meet another strong team after so many tough games in the Euros. It is good we enjoy the moment we are in after this wonderful summer, but we know we still have to work to do to take the next step forward."" Full-back Lucy Bronze was equally as excited, and even has her eyes set on taking the crown of the U.S. next summer in Australia and New Zealand.  “That will make [my trophy cabinet] full,” she said. “I think we’ve had a winning mindset for a couple of years now. We’ve been pushing that and just needed to match it on the field and we’ve finally done that. “It’s nice to be able to back up what we’ve been saying, that we’re good enough to win things, good enough to win tournaments and make finals. We’ve finally done that and we want to continue to do that.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-sell-out-wembley-european-champions-uswnt/bltdeb69031d771dc7b,Ewan Gennery,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1524,Who is winning the 27-strong race to buy Chelsea FC from Roman Abramovich?,"Roman Abramovich's sale of Chelsea through US investment bank Raine Group enters the final stages with the last remaining bidders entering the fray.  There are thought to be 27 billionaire consortiums, hedge funds and other high net worth players registering their monetary bids with their plans for the future attached.  The deadline is on Friday at 9pm UK time (5pm EST) for the majority partners to officially submit their proposals and offers, at which point they will be narrowed down to just a few before a final decision is made.  First of all, this is not necessarily a bidding war, with the winners to be chosen more on their ability to run a major sports organisation. Any offers to include part-fan ownership or a place on the board for supporters will be welcomed, but it won't be a requirement from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).  They also want potential buyers to commit to maintaining the activity in the women's team, academy and Chelsea Foundation. Alongside that, any proposals to develop Stamford Bridge, which remains small for a club of Chelsea's size would also be seen in a positive light. The first group to go public about buying Chelsea were Todd Boehly and Hansjorg Wyss, who have since added London property developer Jonathan Goldstein to their ranks.  They have also brought in Danny Finkelstein, a former UK government adviser, and Barbara Charone, a PR executive with clients including Madonna, Rod Stewart and Foo Fighters, to their ranks as non-executive board directors should their bid become successful. The pair are two of the Blues' most high-profile supporters and regularly attend home matches.  The Ricketts family, who own Major League Baseball (MLB) team the Chicago Cubs, have linked up with hedge fund leader Ken Griffin to make an offer.  Also from the United States is Woody Johnson, who owns the NFL's New York Jets. He is said to have launched a £2bn ($2.6bn) bid for the west Londoners.  There's offers from the United Kingdom with Aethel Partners, a financial institution in London, offering a £2bn ($2.6bn) proposal with a further £50 million ($66m) to be immediately released to cover the costs of this uncertain period. Although UK-based, the firm is headed by Portuguese entrepreneur Ricardo Silva. London luxury property developer and Chelsea supporter Nick Candy has been very public about his interest in buying Chelsea. He is currently working with Blues legend Gianluca Vialli's company Tifosy Capital and Advisory to help raise funds.  Lord Sebastian Coe, a Conservative Member of Parliament, Chelsea supporter and former Athletics athlete, is in the running to buy the Blues with fellow fan and former Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton.  Creative Artists Agency's investment bank Evolution Media Capital is also backing Broughton and Coe. There are fears that it could be seen as insider trading, with CAA owning the world's biggest football agency. Outside of the UK and US are other players, with the most notable option being Saudi Media. The private consortium led by Chelsea supporting Mohamed Alkhereiji, who is also the CEO of the parent company Engineer Holding Group.  Although Alkhereiji has worked and lived in the UK for an extended period, it remains to be seen whether being from Saudi Arabia will adversely affect their bid.  They have wide-reaching plans for Chelsea including replacing shirt sponsor Three with an option from the Middle East and redeveloping Stamford Bridge.  South Korean C&P Sports Group and Hana Financial Group have said they have made a bid. C&P CEO Catalina Kim said: ""We are preparing our bid.  ""There has never been investment into a top tier football club made by South Korean capital before. It is time for a change.” Turkish billionaire Muhsin Bayrak, chairman of AB Grup Holding, has been vocal in his interest and 'wants to fly the flag of Turkey at Stamford Bridge.' However, several sources have played down his role as a frontrunner.  The FT have added that US investment company Oaktree have made an offer on Chelsea but sources close to the company refused to comment.  British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe has previously expressed an interest in buying Chelsea before securing French side Nice in 2019. However, he has since withdrawn his interest after Abramovich put the club up for sale. There are thought to be almost a dozen other bids that have yet to be made public.  John Terry is leading a £250 million ($329m) from a secret 'True Blue' consortium to put the supporters at the heart of the club, through NFT and fan tokens. Similarly, a group called ChelseaDAO (a decentralised autonomous organisation) says they are trying to buy a 10% stake to allow supporters a say through fan tokens using the cryptocurrency Ethereum.  It is hoped that it will be completed sooner rather than later to minimise costs being felt at the club. Every day that the club is sanctioned is damaging the Blues's bottom line and could lead to cash flow issues further down the line.  There's an appetite to do a deal quickly to ensure Chelsea can become unsanctioned again so the club can operate as normal as soon as possible.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/who-is-winning-the-27-strong-race-to-buy-chelsea-fc-from/bltbf16e4d01725027e,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1529,‘I understand how the people of Ukraine feel’ – How refugee turned NWSL star Nadia Nadim is helping the victims of Russia’s invasion,"For the last two weeks, the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag has been more prominent than ever in all walks of life, including in sport. The unity shown by athletes and fans in sending messages of support to the nation after Russia’s invasion has been huge, with Manchester City’s Oleksandr Zinchenko, captain of the men’s national team, having been moved to tears by the affection being shown. For Nadia Nadim, a refugee herself who fled Afghanistan as a child after her father was executed by the Taliban regime, it’s been ""amazing"" to see people come together to spread these messages, but the reasons why they are needed continue to sadden her. ""I understand how the people feel,"" Nadim told GOAL. ""No one really wants to leave their families, homes, identity, everything behind. ""I can see by the pictures how the kids are and everyone's just in distress. It breaks my heart. I hate wars. For me, it doesn't make any sense. There's a lot of ways you can solve your problems and by killing innocent people, I don't think that's the solution. It has never been. ""That's the worst part for me - it's always the innocent ones that pay the price. The children, women, the ones that are not even involved. They have nothing to say. It's heartbreaking to watch."" Nadim has never been one to stand by while such things are happening, though. Last summer, she helped raise almost $90,000 for Afghan women after the Taliban took control of her home country again. Now, the Racing Louisville forward is working with Game of Our Lives (GOL), a social platform designed to encourage and facilitate social activism, on its Humane Ukraine campaign, which launched on Friday morning. Through it, people can donate items or money, sign petitions, educate others and more. ""I thought it was an amazing idea,"" Nadim said. ""I want to help, I want to make a change and having a platform where you actually have more people to help you and see it, I think that's a cool way to do it. For me, it was a no-brainer."" Initially, when Nadim was approached about working with GOL, it was to create action that could empower women and girls, addressing gender inequality. The focus now is on helping those in Ukraine – but she has ""a lot of plans"" further down the line, too. ""In so many countries, girls are not allowed to get an education or even be a part of sports,"" she said. ""Having the opportunity to maybe bring sports in one way or another will be amazing because - this is something from my experience - I think football has a huge power. It's not just a game, it's also a tool to educate. ""I feel like I've done it when I was younger, in my community. I just kept playing football and then, in the end, people turn and have a different point of view. If we can do that on a bigger scale and in areas where girls are not allowed to attend football, then we educate the people around them. That'll be amazing. ""You want little girls to have the same opportunities, same access, as boys."" Demanding better for women and girls has always been something Nadim has stood for. Last year, as the NWSL was rocked by allegations of negligence and sexual abuse, she drew attention to some of her experiences. In a series of tweets, Nadim claimed that her signature had been faked on a contract extension in the past and, after suffering an ACL injury in September, that lawyers at the league said she had to have surgery in the U.S., or they could consider taking ""actions"" against her. ""If something's unfair, or something's not being done right, I think you have an obligation to use your voice,"" she added. ""By using your voice, you're addressing an issue. By addressing the issue, you have the opportunity to change it or fix the problem. For me, it's always been the case. ""I was in shock when all of that happened [in the NWSL] and it seems like it's been going on for such a long time. That's what bothered me, you know? Imagine if we had stopped this earlier. We could've helped so many girls or players before. ""I really hope that from now on, in the future, we're not going to see things like that in the league and then the only thing we have to concentrate on is football and how we can improve the game even more and make it even bigger.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ukraine-refugee-nwsl-nadia-nadim-helping-victims-russia/blt934ccfa3dd78fbf2,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1544,Messi & Mbappe model PSG’s new Chicago Bulls-inspired kit as Jordan Brand partnership continues,"Paris Saint-Germain have released a fourth kit to be used in their 2021-22 campaign, with Lionel Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe asked to model an all-white offering that is inspired by the legendary Chicago Bulls team of the 1990s.

1559,History in the making as all-transgender team TRUK United face Dulwich Hamlet Women in first for English football,"On Thursday, March 31, 2022, as most English fans are impatiently waiting for the Premier League to return after the international break, football history will be made at Champion Hill. At the non-league stadium in south London, Dulwich Hamlet Women will be taking on TRUK United FC in a friendly match. The date is appropriate, as it coincides with Transgender Day of Visibility [TDoV], and TRUK United are a charity team offshoot from Trans Radio UK. TRUK United are a team entirely made up of transgender women, and this will be the first time such a side has played a game in British football. They have tough opposition for the occasion, too – a semi-professional side from the fifth tier of the English game. For Paula Griffin, a player for TRUK United and a volunteer at Dulwich Hamlet for more than three decades, this game represents both a labour of love and a dream come true. Speaking exclusively to GOAL, she says: ""I spoke to Lucy Clark [founder of TRUK], and said this might be a game we were able to arrange during the season. ""It's taken a while to get to this stage. We were trying to look for a good date but league fixtures were being moved around. But we managed to get a date which worked well, with it being TDoV. ""I have been overwhelmed by the support the Dulwich Hamlet players and management have given to this game. ""I've been involved with the club for 30 years and been involved with all sorts of jobs – I've run the club website, I've been on the committee, run the charity trust. ""The club has supported me so much over recent years – I've had cancer, I've come out as a transgender woman – and the support and acceptance from this club, it makes me emotional to talk about it. ""Everyone has accepted me as myself, so to be able to put on a game like this... the experience has been overwhelming."" There is immense excitement from the Dulwich Hamlet side, too, with the club having established itself as one of the most liberal and inclusive on the English football pyramid. On March 31st will be taking part in an historic match at Champion Hill as @DHFC_W face @Trukunitedfc raising funds for the amazing @TRUKListens providing support to the transgender community. Tickets on sale very soon via @seetickets 🏳️‍⚧️ pic.twitter.com/GgrpOvKRbl Dulwich Hamlet central midfielder Zoe Elmore is sadly missing the game due to a long-term elbow injury, but says she and her fellow players have backed playing the historic game from the start. The New York-born player, who has played for Dulwich Hamlet for the last seven years, tells GOAL: ""I was the first player to catch wind that we were participating in this, and it was really exciting.  ""To play devil's advocate, it will be difficult given how our scheduling is, but it is really exciting. Our club stands for inclusivity in sport, and especially standing with women in sport."" Team-mate and centre-back Ceylon Hickman agrees, and says the game can go a long way towards promoting LGBT+ inclusion and acceptance in sport, something she is passionate about through working in her day job for charity Football Beyond Borders. She says: ""I am super excited for this game, it is history-making. It is a privileged moment to play in a game that is breaking boundaries, and setting a path for how football should go.  ""I work with schools around the country, children who are passionate about football. I'm currently working with a school near Dulwich and I am doing everything I can to get the kids at the game. ""It would be their first live football match and it is the perfect game to introduce them with, as it represents everything we stand for at Dulwich."" The friendly arrives amid a renewed focus on the place of transgender people within sport, in particular trans women, from the debate over Lia Thomas competing in the NCAA Swimming Championships, to the recent suspension of an 'LGBT-inclusive' five-a-side league in London over its adherence to the FA's ""archaic"" rules on trans players. For Elmore, as a cisgender female football player, she is proud to try and lead the way by showing that concerns over the future of women's sport is little more than a moral panic. She says: ""I know it's a hot topic, but I feel there needs to be more normalcy on women playing football. I hate this stigma, this barrier that women cannot be themselves and play the sport that they love. I hope this match shines a light on that.  In celebration of the fact that our game is for everyone, Trans Radio football club will be making their debut at Champion Hill in a special invitational match against our very own Dulwich Hamlet women’s team on 31/3/22➡️https://t.co/QsrTISeoXc #DHFC pic.twitter.com/ghXyKkElZV ""It's a tough conversation to have as a cisgender woman. All we can do is support and give a safe space, using our platform as best we can to normalise all women playing football. ""I don't want to downplay it but, from my perspective, I want it to be a normal football match. I know it isn't, for so many reasons, but it's a friendly match against another team of women, and that should draw a crowd regardless. ""Everyone I have spoken to has been really positive. Having pro-trans conversations, just like anti-racism and anti-sexism conversations, are part of our club. It feels really natural to be part of a historic match which hopefully isn't historic for very long. ""I hate that there is a perception around this. We are trying to normalise this and I hate that in 2022 this still has to be a conversation.  ""Recently, there has been a lot of negativity around trans women competing against cis women in sport, and hopefully this can break down some of those barriers."" Hickman feels the negativity towards trans women in sport is an offshoot of misogynistic attitudes towards women in football generally, citing the historic and current comparative lack of funding and media coverage of their game compared to the men's sport She says: ""It is frustrating that we have to have these conversations where you have to actively shift people's perceptions. There are systems and structures in our world which make trans women some of the most persecuted people in western society.  ""What football is to me and so many others is a space of radical acceptance, it's a feeling of belonging, where you can let go and forget about the rest of your life for 90 minutes. Anyone should be able to experience that. ""The men's game is such a reflection of society, as a hetero-dominated culture, and what is beautiful about the women's game, there is this overriding sense of being a minority in the game, so you have this sense of solidarity and camaraderie. Trans women are no different, they should be in that space. ""You have to work harder to include trans women in that space, and Thursday is an active attempt to make that happen.  ""It will be a really powerful coming together of allied forces, and hopefully providing a blueprint for what football can be. All we can keep doing is knocking on the door, because that's what women's football can do."" Griffin is aware that one friendly will not do much on its own to shift attitudes, and the reaction she has got within Dulwich Hamlet fans while promoting the game as a volunteer has been notably mixed – but that the only way to change minds is to be as visible and vocal as possible. She says: ""I've had a very interesting reaction – at the last home Dulwich game I was handing out flyers about the match, and there was a difference in reaction. ""On the whole, female supporters were very positive, saying they will be there, while male supporters... you say those two things, women's sport and transgender people in sport, and they take a step back. There was that inkling of reticence, and I definitely saw that on a gender basis. ""There's a long way to go, but if we start chipping away little by little we can make a difference.  ""I'm so hopeful this can be a starting point to get away from the sh*t we are seeing around the coverage of Lia Thomas, the misrepresented photographs and stuff like that, which we have to fight against as grassroots footballers, to let them hear our voices and I think we can really start to make a change in our game."" TRUK have managed to put together a surprisingly bulky squad of 21 players, considering the dearth of trans players at any sort of competitive level in UK football, with a couple of notable names, including semi-pro goalkeeper Blair Hamilton and former Watford academy player Sammy Walker. However, they will certainly start as underdogs against a semi-pro Dulwich Hamlet side, although Griffin is quietly confident of a respectable result, predicting a 3-3 draw while Elmore and Hickman go for a 3-1 victory to Hamlet. Griffin says: ""We have a good range of players with a wide range of experience from all over the country.  ""Sammy, if she's fit – if not, we'll get her on the pitch on a stretcher as she's brilliant – is our skipper. We have Blair in goal, she plays for Hastings and is an excellent keeper. Then there's myself, the ultimate utility player – useless in every position. ""It's difficult to prepare, as a lot of our players are training with their own teams. From a personal point of view, I train with Goal Diggers FC, others might be coming in a bit cold. Hopefully, we'll get in a good warm-up and, of course, we are wanting to allow all the players to play. ""As a game, it has that thing with trans women in sport – it's a Catch-22: if we lose, it's a joke; if we win, it's because we have this supposed physical advantage. I'm hoping for a high-scoring draw to keep everyone happy!"" The amateur side may be doing well to grab a result, though, as the semi-pro outfit will not be taking it easy. ""I sadly can't play in this, but we will approach this like every other match,"" says Elmore. ""We want to win and we'll take no prisoners. We're a competitive bunch, we don't step onto a pitch unless we are going out to win."" Hickman adds: ""We have a challenge on our hands, and it being a mid-weeker changes our training schedule, but we are in it to win it, and hopefully we will get a good crowd down.  ""It'll be difficult for Paula to be playing against the pink and blue, but we want to win, we are up for it – then, we have the league leaders on Sunday.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/transgender-truk-united-dulwich-hamlet-women/bltcdd6d7d4ecbb1547,Emma Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1585,‘Try having your sport taken away’ – Meet the club making sure women’s football’s 50-year ban is not forgotten ,"As around 50 players bundled together on a pitch at Haggerston Park for a photo, the curiosity of a group of young boys nearby was piqued. Each player was sporting a shirt with a distinct art deco design, either in black or green, but it was the number on the back of every single one that prompted one of the boys to ask a question. ""Why do they all say 1921 on the back?"" they asked. The response they got left them rather surprised. This Sunday, December 5, 2021, is the 100th anniversary of the Football Association’s ban of women’s football in England – a ban that lasted 50 years. To mark it, Goal Diggers FC, a grassroots club in London, has launched a protest kit to educate those who don’t recognise what a humongous setback it was for the women's game – which attracted tens of thousands of fans in the early 20th century. On Sunday, at the Women’s FA Cup final between Arsenal and Chelsea, some 40 members of GDFC will be in the stands at Wembley wearing their eye-catching kit – the art deco is a nod to the 1920s, while the green signifies how women are now “reclaiming the pitch”, designer Anastasia Kuchta tells GOAL. The club is not alone in promoting it, either. It’s in the National Football Museum, England stars are behind it and so are relatives of players from the famous Dick, Kerr Ladies side that marked the era of women’s football that preceded the ban. The words of one of the stars of that team, Alice Kell, run down the sleeves of GDFC’s special shirt: “We play for the love of the game and are determined to go on.” It’s a quote that can be related to the club itself, actually, where playing for the love of the game unites 200 members with incredibly different stories. Liz Ward remembers feeling “sick with nerves” at the idea of anyone at school finding out that she was a girl who played football. She stopped for 13 years, then discovered Goal Diggers. Laura Howard-Harman stopped playing around the age of 15 but wanted to get back into things and found GDFC. “I went down for a taster session and it was a breath of fresh air,” she tells GOAL. “I hadn't kicked a ball in 10 years and nobody cared.” When Hannah May decided she wanted to start playing properly for the first time at the age of 31, Goal Diggers was the place for her to do that. Now, she plays four times a week. Kuchta grew up in Florida. To regularly hear about the stigma of young women playing football in England is strange to her. “It's very widely accepted for women to play football,” she explains, remembering her upbringing in the United States. “It was actually heavily encouraged.” All four have different experiences, come from different backgrounds and have different levels of ability, but that they are now part of the same 200-strong club of women and non-binary players sums up the variety that defines the club. Its diversity has increased massively in the six years since it was founded, too. Ward, whose father is from Saint Kitts and Nevis in the Caribbean, remembers the first time she went along to a session and not seeing many people of colour. “Now, it's so different,” she tells GOAL. “People have different life stories and it's amazing. “There's women of colour, trans women, non-binary people, black people, Asian people, people from just every single walk of life. That, I think, is the biggest change.” Ward is part of trying to ensure that continues, taking up a role as an inclusion and diversity officer at the club, which sits nicely alongside the fantastic work she does with Stonewall, the largest LGBTQ+ rights organisation in Europe. She has been involved in launching initiatives and ideas that embody the values that run throughout GDFC, helping to run educational workshops that teach attendees about oppression, identity, intersectionality and just being a better ally. She’s not alone, either. May, for example, is currently running a Crowdfunder to raise money to buy football shirts for children who might not otherwise get a Christmas present, having teamed up with a charity called Kitmas. Kuchta and Howard-Harman, meanwhile, have been heavily involved with the protest kit and their efforts will be on show for all to see this Sunday. With a record-breaking crowd anticipated for the FA Cup final, there will likely be plenty more people intrigued about the significance of 1921, just like the young boys at Haggerston Park. “I was kind of like, 'Are they taking the p*ss?'” May remembers. “And they were like, 'No, no, what does it mean?' “It's a really good talking point. Lots of people don't know about it at all. I didn't really know much about it. My niece, who plays football, and my brother, it's something they haven't heard of at all. “I think it's good that we're getting it out there a little bit more.”  These are exactly the kind of conversations GDFC want to start. With women’s football regularly subject to criticism, particularly as its place in the spotlight increases, it’s important to remind those quick to judge of its setback. “The sport was banned,” Howard-Harman says. “Therefore, we couldn't play and we couldn't develop. It feels like our sport gets denigrated a little bit because of that. “Try having your thing taken away from you for 50 years. Then see where you're at.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/making-sure-womens-football-50-year-ban-not-forgotten/blt7dc92496e367f861,Amee Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1586,Why have Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates fallen so far behind Mamelodi Sundowns?,"Mamelodi Sundowns' dealings in the January transfer window have put more daylight between them and floundering Soweto clubs Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. Increasingly, players are snubbing the likes of Pirates and Chiefs to join Sundowns, and the more successful the Pretoria club are becoming, the more players choose them over the Soweto giants. Worryingly if you're a Chiefs or a Pirates fan, Sundowns seem in danger of pulling further away from the chasing pack. So how has this happened - what have Sundowns done right, and the other clubs done wrong? Money There's no denying it, that to a large extent, Sundowns have bought their way to success. For 15 years now, the club owner and one of Africa’s richest men, Patrice Motsepe, has been throwing cash at the team. Sundowns have been able to spend large sums bringing in players, and paying the best salaries. In the early years, and even more recently, not all their signings have been successful, and a lot of players have seen their careers stagnating.  But with so much money available, it's never really been a problem and Sundowns have been able to absorb their losses. Other clubs just can't compete with that. Management Since the Pitso Mosimane era (2012 onwards), Masandawana have become an increasingly well-run, well-structured team, with a low turnover in terms of the technical team and management.  There is good stability, there seems to be less interference from upper management when it comes to on-the-field matters, and the continuity of having a coach for eight seasons like was the case with Mosimane, has made a marked difference.  What Downs have done so well is to take the success which Mosimane initially brought, and to build on that, to create a club and players ingrained with a winning culture. With Mosimane's former lieutenants Manqoba Mngqithi and Rhulani Mokwena now at the helm, it's proving a difficult train to stop for the opposition. Ambition Motsepe always made it clear that he wanted to conquer not only the PSL, but also Africa, and the world. Aiming so high has helped instil a real culture of excellence at the club.  When it comes to recruitment, Masandawana scour the globe, unlike their rivals who often look local or to Southern African nations for a bargain. Coupled with the innovations and partnerships, not to mention the success of their women's team, it's clear to see that Sundowns are biding by their motto that the ‘Sky Is The Limit’. How do Bucs and Amakhosi catch up? Money doesn't solve everything, but Chiefs and Pirates are going to have to spend more in the transfer window, and also ensure that they spend wisely, and that their recruitment structures are improved.  The Soweto giants need to look carefully at their behind-the-scenes staff and ask themselves if they have the right people for the job – not only for this season but for the next five or 10 years.  With Sundowns, you feel like there is a long term vision. At Chiefs and Pirates, it feels like things have gone stale and are in need of a shake-up, through the two clubs. That Pirates still don’t even have a permanent head coach says a lot, while Chiefs have also made poor choices in their own player and coach recruitment over the past six or seven years.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-have-kaizer-chiefs-and-orlando-pirates-fallen-so-far/bltddb4b209ff725bca,Anthony McLennan,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

1623,PSG vs Lyon: A game about much more than the Women’s Champions League final,"When Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon meet in the second leg of their Women’s Champions League semi-final on Saturday night, it will be the 54th meeting between these two French rivals. However, despite the latter only coming out 3-2 winners in last week’s very competitive first leg, for a long time, they were not rivals. Indeed, it took PSG 22 attempts to beat Lyon, first doing so back in 2014 and, even since then, they’ve only emerged victorious a further seven times. That was understandable. Between 2007 and 2020, Lyon would win 14 successive league titles, a record total in itself. The club also hold the record for most Coupe de France wins, with nine, five of those successive, and the most Women’s Champions League trophies, with seven – again, five of them successive. Lyon created a dynasty in women’s football, the kind that will never be replicated and have long set the bar for how a club should treat its female athletes. But last season, PSG made a statement of their own. The Parisians snapped Lyon’s title-winning streak and picked up a first Division 1 Feminine title. Not only that – PSG knocked Lyon out of the Champions League for the first time in seven years. La Dame de Fer et nos #CHAMPIONNES ! ❤️💙Vous aimez ? ✨📸 Julien Scussel pic.twitter.com/9ZIRVNLI5D “I have to say, I was sick of always losing in this kind of scenario here,” said PSG midfielder Grace Geyoro afterwards. It was her strike that sent the club into the semi-finals of the competition. There, she and her team would lose to eventual champions Barcelona on away goals, but it was a monumental season nonetheless; a first league title, the purging of some demons in this rivalry and a statement that PSG had what it takes to be a serious threat. Meanwhile, around 300 miles south of Paris, things weren’t so rosy. It would be Lyon’s first trophyless season in 16 years and changes would be made to ensure that didn’t happen again, most notably in the recruitment of Sonia Bompastor, who won 11 trophies with the club as a player, as head coach. Boosted by the return of Ada Hegerberg, too, those changes have worked. Lyon are well on track to take back their league title and look like their old selves again. Now, the problems are with PSG. A crazy situation earlier this season saw Kheira Hamraoui beaten with iron bars by masked men and sidelined for a spell as a result.  Later that month, Hayet Abidal, wife of former Barcelona and France defender Eric, announced she was filing for divorce after he admitted to an affair with Hamraoui, following links between the pair on the PSG midfielder’s phone were discovered by investigators. She has again made headlines this month after an altercation with team-mate Sandy Baltimore in training the day before the first leg of the UWCL semi-final. Hamraoui didn’t play last weekend, and she will not this weekend either. “In difficult moments, the team has always found the resources to go for qualification,” head coach Didier Olle-Nicolle said on Friday, echoing words Geyoro had said to L’Equipe last week: “We can hate each other outside but, on the field, we have to manage to win.” Those aren’t PSG’s only issues. Contracts are expiring for some important players, most notably star striker Marie-Antoinette Katoto. Last year, the club lost a number of stars despite lifting the league title – Irene Paredes joined Barcelona, while Christiane Endler, Perle Morroni and Signe Bruun all signed for Lyon. It’s a path that has been well-trodden over the years. For those players to still sign for Lyon after such a successful year with PSG was a suggestion that the power in France is still firmly held by its most illustrious club – but for the latter, to be the best club in France is not enough. The seven-time European champions crave success bigger than that and are desperate to reclaim their status as the continent’s best. With so much talk of how great Barcelona, the reigning champions, are and suggestions from some that they could create a legacy like Lyon’s, it’s no wonder Europe’s long-standing powerhouse feels a little aggrieved. ""There was women's football before Barcelona, ​​and it was played here for years,” Hegerberg told L’Equipe earlier this month. “We have to win again to regain our place in world football. We have the chance to do it this season. We have never lost against Barcelona."" To face the Catalan side in the showpiece event, though, Lyon first have to dismiss a familiar face. Despite the momentum in France swinging massively away from PSG this season, and the defensive horror show from the team in the first leg, they go into Saturday’s game with a huge chance to progress. At home, in front of what is anticipated to be a record crowd for a women’s domestic match in France, if not a sell-out, they trail by just one goal. The league title and the power might not be with PSG, but to prevent Lyon from reaching the final of the competition they have made their own would be the perfect way to hurt them. After a much-improved year, it would be a devastating result for Lyon. ""We have a lot of qualities in our team,"" Bompastor said on Friday. ""We are ready. We have the qualities to beat this Paris team. ""We have goals in our season and [Saturday's] game is one of the most important games. We hope to have a more important one with the final.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/psg-lyon-about-more-than-women-champions-league-final/blt9a485e735b93c0f9,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

The 25-year-old, then 18, was a part of the side that was knocked out by eventual runners-up Japan in the last 16. Now a European champion with the Oranje and a World Cup finalist herself, the Women's Super League star has opened up on how close she came to bowing out of the game at a young age. ""It was the toughest moment of my career,"" she said to MOTDx. ""I was really close to retiring. When I came home, I said I couldn't do it any more. I couldn't deal with the pressure. ""I didn't like football and I told my mum 'this is me done'. I was going to play for fun back in Holland."" As one of the bright lights of the WSL and the women's game at large, the Dutchwoman admits that her drive to play is borne out of a love for friendship - and that it is ""amazing"" she can be considered as a role model to young players. ""I started playing football because I wanted to be part of a team with my friends, I'm still the same now,"" she added. ""It is amazing to be seen as a role model and for young girls to say 'I want to be like Miedema' or 'I want to be like Fran Kirby'.

1717,Everton left-back Mykolenko calls out 'sh*thead' Russian footballers for staying silent amid Ukraine invasion,"Everton left-back Vitaliy Mykolenko has called out ""sh*thead"" Russian footballers, criticising those that have stayed silent amid their country's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Mykolenko, who represents Ukraine at international level, moved to Everton from Dynamo Kiev in January and made headlines after embracing his compatriot Oleksandr Zinchenko before the Toffees' defeat to Manchester City on February 26. The football community in England has united to pledge their support towards Ukraine as Russian military forces continue to invade the country, but Mykolenko feels Russian stars have been inexcusably quiet. The 22-year-old has taken to social media to launch a foul-mouthed rant against the Russian football team, who have been suspended from competing by FIFA and UEFA due to the crisis in Ukraine. In a post that tagged Russian player Artem Dzyuba, Mykolenko wrote: ""Whilst you remain silent, b*itch, along with your sh*thead football teammates, peaceful civilians are being killed in Ukraine. “You will be locked in your dungeon for the rest of your life and most importantly the lives of your kids. And I’m glad.” Everton's links with Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov have come under scrutiny since the invasion of Ukraine, with the 68-year-old seeing his assets frozen by The European Council. Usmanov is not officially part of the day-to-day running of the Toffees, but his private Russian holding company USM sponsors the club's training ground. Megafon, another of Usmanov's firms, is the main shirt sponsor of the Everton women's team, and Labour MP Chris Bryant has urged the club to distance itself from him. ""Alisher Usmanov has already been sanctioned by the EU but not yet by the UK,"" Bryant said in the House of Commons. ""But I suspect he will be pretty soon on a UK list and Everton should certainly be cutting ties with him already.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/everton-mykolenko-shthead-russia-footballers-ukraine/blt13d982dd2dd4524b,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1722,U.S. Soccer Federation reaches 'historic' equal pay agreement with both men & women's national teams,"The United States men's and women's national teams have reached historic collective bargaining agreements (CBA) with the United States Soccer Federation (USSF). The agreements equalise pay from all competition appearances for both teams as well as equality in the sharing of commercial revenue. The agreements between the USSF, the women's players union (USWNTPA) and men's union (USNSTPA) will run until 2028. USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone hailed the agreement as a game-changer for the whole world. ""This is a truly historic moment. These agreements have changed the game forever here in the United States and have the potential to change the game around the world,"" said Cone.  ""U.S. Soccer and the USWNT and USMNT players have reset their relationship with these new agreements and are leading us forward to an incredibly exciting new phase of mutual growth and collaboration as we continue our mission to become the preeminent sport in the United States."" USWNTPA president Becky Sauerbrunn said: ""The accomplishments in this CBA are a testament to the incredible efforts of WNT players on and off the field.  ""The gains we have been able to achieve are both because of the strong foundation laid by the generations of WNT players that came before the current team and through our union’s recent collaboration with our counterparts at the USNSTPA and leadership at U.S. Soccer. We hope that this agreement and its historic achievements in not only providing for equal pay but also in improving the training and playing environment for national team players will similarly serve as the foundation for continued growth of women’s soccer both in the United States and abroad."" Among other things, the CBAs will ""provide for equal rates of pay"" for the senior national team. ""For friendly games, players on the USWNT and USMNT will be paid identical roster appearance fees and performance payments, based on the outcome of the match and the rank of the opponent, with identical tiering structures,"" the announcement declared. The players' unions will also ""pool and share a portion of prize money paid for the teams’ participation in the 2022 men’s World Cup and the 2023 women’s World Cup.  ""In this arrangement, the players on the 2022 MWC roster and on the 2023 WWC roster will be paid an equal percentage of the collective prize money paid by FIFA for the teams’ participation and performance in their respective World Cups. The same will occur with the 2026 MWC and the 2027 MWC."" Furthermore, the CBAs improve terms for ""player health and safety, data privacy and the need to balance responsibilities to both club and country"", with the USSF providing child care during training camps and matches and introducing retirement plans. The USWNT players have given up fixed contracts in order to guarantee equal pay with the men's team. Surrendering the contracts may be a big sacrifice as those who are not part of the squad will no longer be paid, but it allows the players to earn more money. In the qualifying matches for the 2023 World Cup, USWNT players will earn $10,000 per game, plus $14,000 per victory. Midge Purce, who was a member of the USWNTPA bargaining team, told The Equalizer: “I think we progressed.  “I think we’ve outgrown some of the conditions that may look like we have lost something. But no, rather, our league is actually strong enough where now we don’t need as many guaranteed contracts. We can be on more of a pay-to-play model. No, I don’t [think we gave up a lot]. I think we did a fantastic job negotiating this CBA and we’re all very proud of it.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/u-s-soccer-federation-historic-equal-pay-agreement-men-women/blt4267a0200fca588b,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

1725,"Wembley: England's stadium capacity, location, facts & video tour","The largest ground in the UK and the second largest in Europe, Wembley stadium was built for the big occasion. Wembley has hosted countless memorable occasions, including the Champions League final between Manchester United and Barcelona in 2011 and the European Championship men's and women's finals in 2021 and 2022. So if you are planning a visit to the home of the England men's and women's national teams, GOAL brings you everything you need to know. Address: Wembley, London HA9 0WS Google maps: Further directions to the stadium can be found here Wembley Stadium is located in the north-western region of London. The stadium is best accessed via train: Wembley Park train station is a five-minute walk from the stadium and can be reached on the Jubilee and Metropolitan Underground lines. Wembley Central train station, which is accessible via the Bakerloo line and the London Overground metro, is also a 10 to 15-minute walk from the stadium. Another nearby access point is Wembley Stadium train station, which can be reached via the overground Chiltern Railways. Local buses 18, 83, 92, and 224 all stop within walking distance of Wembley Stadium. The stadium can be reached by car via the A406, which can be accessed from the M1. Once on the A406, road signs will direct you to the stadium. To get to the stadium by car from central London, take the A404 Harrow road, which is accessible from the A40. When you reach Wembley Rail Station on Harrow Road, turn right onto Wembley Hill Road, and follow the road signs to ground. On May 19, 2007, Chelsea and Manchester United competed in the FA Cup final to mark Wembley Stadium's opening ceremony, in a match which saw the London club lift the trophy in a 1-0 win. It wasn't the first game to be played at the new venue, however, with England U-21's fixture against Italy, that ended in a 3-3 draw, having that honour. The old Wembley Stadium, originally built in 1923, was torn down in 2003, and construction on the brand new Wembley started on the same site. The new Wembley Stadium was completed and prepared to open in 2007 after a number of delays and postponements, caused by unforeseen costs and construction complications. Foster & Partners and Populous were the architecture firms who designed the new stadium, which is estimated to have cost a total of £757 million ($916m), or a staggering £1.27 billion ($1.53bn) in today's money. The most recognisable feature of Wembley stadium is its grand 133-metre tall arch, which spans over 315 metres, making it the longest single span roof structure in the world. Wembley Stadium also has a sliding roof located 52 metres above the pitch. The roof does not fully shut but it still manages to cover every seat in the stadium, which makes Wembley the largest fully covered stadium in the world. Wembley Stadium has a capacity of 90,000, which can be increased for particular events. Wembley Stadium is not used on a regular basis by any club football side, but it is the home of England's men's and women's national football teams. However, between 2017 and 2019, it did host all of Tottenham's home matches while they were constructing their new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Wembley also stages several domestic cup finals including the FA Cup, the Carabao Cup, the Women's FA Cup, in addition to the National League and EFL play-off finals. The Community Shield is also traditionally played at Wembley, although in 2022 Leicester City's King Power Stadium hosted Liverpool's win over Manchester City, due to the women's Euro 2022 final being played at Wembley the day after. As Wembley isn’t in constant use for football purposes, it does accommodate a wide range of events, including concerts, boxing, rugby and American football. The artists who have performed at Wembley Stadium include Coldplay, Madonna, Eminem, Ed Sheeran and One Direction. In 2017, Adele's concert attracted the stadium's highest-ever attendance of 98,000. Since 1929, the Rugby League Challenge Cup Final had been held at the old Wembley Stadium, and in 2007, following Wembley's reconstruction, the cup final made its way back there. The stadium has also played host to several Rugby Union events and, from 2009 to 2017, Saracens frequently played Aviva Premiership and Heineken Cup matches there. The WBA and IBF super-middleweight championship rematch between Carl Froch and George Groves took place at Wembley Stadium on May 31, 2014, marking the venue's first boxing event. Since then, the stadium has hosted a number of notable boxing events, including the heavyweight bout between Anthony Joshua and Wladimir Klitschko. In April 2022, Tyson Fury remained undefeated as he was victorious over Dillian Whyte at Wembley Stadium, an event attended by 94,000 people, a record for boxing at the venue. Wembley Stadium has a long history with American football, dating back to 1984. Wembley has hosted several regular season NFL games since its renovation, a role it now shares with the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. A seating plan for Wembley is available on the official Wembley stadium website. Wembley Stadium provides assisted behind-the-scenes stadium tours that include the dressing rooms, press room, players' tunnel and royal box. Tours are available every day of the week between 10:00am and 4:00pm (UK time), though times may vary on event days.

1726,From invisible to heroic: How Italy become a dark horse for the Women's Euros,"'Calcio discovers women'.  When Italy women's national team last competed in a major tournament, that was Gazzetta dello Sport's headline, World Cup fever sweeping a football-obsessed nation that has yet to make the mark it is capable of on the women’s game. As the Azzurre reached the quarter-finals in France, beating China in the last 16 after topping a group that also featured Brazil, something was happening back home. The players wouldn’t realise that until after their exit in the last eight, to the European champions and eventual finalists, Netherlands. Upon flying home, they would be overwhelmed. Midfielder Aurora Galli remembers returning to her hometown to see the whole community in the piazza, there to celebrate her and what she had helped the country achieve. It was monumental. That summer proved a catalyst for Italy in its quest to unlock the potential of this great nation, a four-time World Cup winner on the men’s side which goes into this summer’s Women’s Euros as a serious dark horse. The players have an even greater opportunity to capture the public’s attention this time around, such has been the change that 2019 has helped to bring along. After it became mandatory for clubs competing in the men’s Serie A to have girls’ academy in 2015, the landscape of the women’s game in Italy has been transformed. Juventus introduced a senior team two years later and were followed by many more giants – Roma, Inter and Milan among them.  The teams have got stronger, as has the league, and, ahead of this summer, Italy took one of its biggest steps forward yet. Juventus was the country’s only representative in the 2021-22 Women’s Champions League group stages, drawn in a ‘group of death’ with two-time champions Wolfsburg and last season’s finalists, Chelsea. Yet, they would come through it and go toe-to-toe with eventual champions Lyon in the next round, only losing 4-3 on aggregate. When Juve head coach Joe Montemurro speaks to GOAL about the challenge of taking on this job last summer, he remembers a “lack of belief on the European stage”. “We probably have exceeded expectations in year one,” he adds. “Now, obviously, people aren't going to probably take us in the manner that some clubs did, but it's great to have that on your back because you want to be at the top level. “You want to be competing in real high-level competitions and playing against the best.  ""If we can get this more often, if we can get more top games at the Allianz, if we can always be in the Champions League group stage and be pitted against the best, it's going to be great for me because I get more games at top level and I learn, the players learn, and the club grows. “They can plan things. They can say, 'Okay, well, Champions League brings in X amount of dollars, we can invest here and do this here. We need to fix up this area, we need to fix up that area.' ""But the only way you can grow is through playing the best and being at the top level. It's the only way you can grow.” That’s not just good for Juventus – it’s good for Italy, who have seven players in their Women’s Euros squad from Montemurro’s side.  Indeed, that Champions League run shows that these players are among, and can compete with, Europe’s best. That’s huge for the present. It comes alongside the growth of the league in general, which is not limited to Juventus’ success or that of the big clubs, but also taking into account the impressive progress of a team like Sassuolo, competing with those top teams on a much smaller budget. It also comes with the news that women’s football in Italy will turn professional for the coming season, which hopefully will only accelerate this already promising evolution. But big moments like the 2019 World Cup and Juventus’ Champions League run are not only big for right now. They’re big for society. They’re big for the future. Attitudes in Italy are already changing.  When GOAL is picked up by a taxi from the Juventus training centre after speaking to Montemurro, it quickly emerges that the driver is a Bianconero, but he is not just a fan of the men’s team – he loves the women’s team too. One of the reasons Italy has been lagging behind other nations is due to lower numbers of girls playing the sport.  That changing mindset in society can reduce of the barriers causing that. Young girls going to watch Juventus play big games, or watching Italy have a potentially great Euros, also helps. “We have many, many other sports, like volleyball, basketball, and there are few teams,” Stefano Braghin, head of Juventus’ women’s team, tells GOAL, talking about recruiting for the academy.  “The girls usually start another sport and then as a second choice, they arrive at football. That doesn't help a lot in terms of the quality of your recruitment.” If that can change, though, there is something special to tap into. “Football in Italy is very much part of the DNA,” Montemurro explains. “It's really interesting because in all the players here I've got who are Italian, you just see a base understanding of tactical knowledge that a lot of the other countries probably don't have, because they grew up with it.” Now, Italy is starting to show that understanding and talent at the top level in the women’s game. Their performances in 2019 announced them to the world – and to the wider public at home. This year, they’ve only enhanced that reputation, not just in Juventus’ success but the results of the national team – beating the 2017 runners-up, Denmark and a fancied Norway earlier this year, while also drawing with Sweden, many people’s favourites, and Spain, another team talked about highly. The present and the future are both incredibly promising. It’s amazing to think what a terrific run at the Euros – a run they’re perfectly capable of with the talent in this team – would do on top of all that.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/italy-women-euros-dark-horse/blt93faf04dda7c3b42,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1730,Why is Community Shield 2022 not at Wembley? King Power Stadium move explained,"In a departure from English football tradition, the annual season curtain-raiser, the Community Shield, will not be held at Wembley in 2022. Instead, the game, which sees Premier League champions Manchester City and FA Cup winners Liverpool go head to head, will be played at the King Power Stadium, home of Leicester City. It will be the first time in 10 years that the super cup showdown is not at 'The Home of Football'. On the previous occasion, the game was moved to Villa Park in Birmingham on account of the fact Wembley was in use for the 2012 Olympics. So, why has the Community Shield been moved away from Wembley in 2022? GOAL explains... This year's Community Shield was moved from Wembley to the King Power Stadium because the London venue is in use for the Women's Euro 2022 final between Germany and England. That game will be played at 5pm BST (12 noon ET) on Sunday, July 31. While the European Championship final does not strictly clash with the Community Shield, which takes place 24 hours earlier at 5pm on Saturday, July 30. It is not clear exactly why Leicester's stadium was chosen as a replacement, but it is a relatively modern event venue, with significant capacity, situated in a central location within England. It is possible that the fact the Foxes won the 2021 Community Shield had a bearing on the decision to relocate to Leicester, but the FA has not confirmed that. Capacity: 32,261 Location: Leicester, England Year built: 2002 Tenants: Leicester City, Leicester City Women King Power Stadium can hold 32,261 spectators, which makes it the 20th biggest stadium in English football. It is significantly smaller than Wembley, which has a capacity of 90,000. Built in 2002, it is comparable in size to Southampton's St Mary's Stadium, the Ricoh Arena in Coventry and Ewood Park, the home of one-time Premier League winners Blackburn Rovers. As well as Leicester City games, the King Power Stadium has also hosted a number of England international matches and games involving Rugby Union team Leicester Tigers.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-is-community-shield-2022-not-at-wembley-king-power/blt2db6fb440db62a4e,Ryan Kelly,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1742,England replaces Chelsea team-mate Kirby in England squad for 2023 Women's World Cup qualifiers vs North Macedonia & Northern Ireland,"Chelsea star Beth England has returned to the England women's team for the World Cup qualifying matches against North Macedonia and Northern Ireland. England has not featured for the national team since November, but comes in to replace Chelsea team-mate Fran Kirby, who has been out of action for the London club with fatigue. Steph Houghton is still absent from the squad after having an operation in late February.  Coach Sarina Wiegman named 24 players in the squad for the 2023 Women’s World Cup qualifying matches.  “I am really looking forward to getting the group back together and hope we can continue our progress as we aim to qualify for the World Cup,"" the Dutch coach said.  ""We will need to be fully focused as I expect both our opponents to give all they can.  “Every time we play, we want to perform to our best and do what is necessary to get a good result. That will be no different for these two important fixtures.  “It is also another opportunity for us to learn more about ourselves for the Euros, particularly against a team we will play in our final group stage match.  ""For now though we have to think only about these next games, working hard to improve our style of play and performing well to get positive results.”  England will meet North Macedonia in Skopje on April 8 before travelling to Belfast to face Northern Ireland four days later. Wiegman's team are top of Group D with a perfect record after six matches and four left to play.

1761,Olivia Moultrie: Record-breaking USWNT hopeful set on world domination,"When Olivia Moultrie was just seven years old, she sat down, created a list of goals and, effectively, planned out the rest of her life. At the time, she was a lot like every other seven-year-old that kicks a ball, and had the same ambitions as many her age. Number one: She wanted to be a professional soccer player. Number two: Win championships. Number three: Win a World Cup. And number four: Be the best player in the world. In a way, on the day she made that list and set those goals for herself, Moultrie's childhood ended. Every moment, every choice, every lawsuit, every training session and every game has been geared towards that fourth goal. Now 16, Moultrie can already say that she has completed her primary goal of becoming a professional. In fact, she completed it three years ago, when she signed her first pro contract and rocketed into the spotlight as American soccer's latest prodigy. This is ridiculous from @olivia_moultrie 🤩🤩🎥 @NWSL pic.twitter.com/hN84BEGUiH Soccer in the United States has never encountered a player like Moultrie, a young girl who is so singularly determined and passionate, while also personable and thoughtful. She is probably the most atypical 16-year-old athlete on the planet and, more than likely, the most self-aware. Nothing Moultrie does is normal because the normal kids don't become the best soccer players in the world; the extraordinary ones do. ""I'm just living that professional soccer player life,"" Moultrie tells GOAL in an exclusive interview, ""and sometimes other people have to pull me back and be like, 'What you're doing, it's crazy.' My dad all the time just stops me and says it's amazing. ""I get so caught up in the moment of just like, I just want more and more and more, and that's what I'm working for every day. ""Sometimes, I have to have family members kind of pull me back and be like, 'Liv you're only 16.' ""It's crazy, but I want everything to happen so fast."" Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: Fast is an understatement. In the years since making her list, Moultrie has become the youngest to achieve just about everything you can achieve in American soccer without playing for the senior national team, establishing herself as a trailblazing prodigy that has fans of all generations hailing her as a role model. She committed to the University of North Carolina at age 11, and promptly backed out of that to become a professional at 13. By 15, she and her family had sued the NWSL, alleging that the league violated the Sherman Antitrust Act with the age limit that was preventing her from playing. Before turning 16, she had won that lawsuit, made her NWSL debut, made her first start and scored her first professional goal. Now, in a year where she should be focusing on getting her driver's license, Moultrie is focused on what she can do to help the Portland Thorns win an NWSL title. She has featured a total of 19 times for the Thorns and is now preparing for the Under-20 World Cup, where she will join the U.S. as far and away the youngest member of the squad. ""I don't want the regular 16-year-old life,"" she says. ""That's why I chose this path. I don't want to really think like, 'Oh, I'm missing out on this' because, no, this is all I've ever wanted. ""And now I am 'living the dream'. I love what I'm doing and that's why I chose to go into this and just jump all the way in."" Moultrie, though, does understand she is missing out on some foundational experiences, the ones that define life for most people her age. She's missing the weekend hangouts, the school dances, the pep rallies, those quiet moments where she can be just like every other 16-year-old. Her family does, though, try to give her some taste of normalcy. ""I love being a sister,"" she says. ""I have two younger sisters and that's a huge part of my life too. That's kind of my view of like, the norm, you know? ""Seeing them in their lives and emailing colleges and working towards what they want, it's been really cool for me to see that. ""I have an amazing family who support me and that's always a big thing that I love to tell the world because they deserve a lot of love for that. They've been behind me and I'm really appreciative of that."" Moultrie is also appreciative of the help she has received along the way from team-mates who, whether willingly or unwillingly, were thrust into older sister roles the moment she showed up in Portland. Christine Sinclair, Lindsey Horan, Tobin Heath, Emily Sonnett, Meghan Klingenberg... Moultrie rattles off the names of those that have, at one point or another, taken her under their wing. ""I wanted to latch on and grab all of the experience they had and just ask all these questions,"" she says. ""What's that kind of life like for them? Because that's what I want."" Like her team-mates, Moultrie has rapidly turned into a role model herself. It's a bit of an unusual phenomenon. One look at Moultrie's social media pages produces a variety of responses, most that would normally be directed at World Cup winners, not teenagers. ""My daughters adore you,"" reads one. ""Thank you for being such a great role model"", another says. One final one: ""The young woman that changed women's football in the U.S."" It can be overwhelming, but in the age of social media, it's not something Moultrie could necessarily avoid, even if she wanted to. Not that she does. She likes being an example, a leader, a role model, much like the women she grew up idolizing. ""I never went into this thinking that or hoping that people are going to look up to me and I'm going to be a role model,"" she says. ""You don't think that but, obviously, that has become a side effect of everything that I've done. ""It's really cool to me. I definitely wanted to be somebody that was able to inspire the younger generation, not just females, but males too. ""The whole thing that I've been fighting for is equal opportunity. We should have the same thing, the same opportunities that the men have and we should be able to do those same things. ""We're capable of it and the world should allow that."" This is ridiculous from @olivia_moultrie 🤩🤩🎥 @NWSL pic.twitter.com/hN84BEGUiH Right now, though, Moultrie is still focused on those main four goals, though she is adding a few more to the list. ""I want to be able to feel like I have the experience of a 25-year-old when I'm 18,"" she says. ""I'm trying to just gather all of that as quickly as possible. ""I want to win championships with the Portland Thorns. I'd love to be able to win NWSL MVP. I think going to Europe is very realistic for me at some point. ""You grow up watching the Champions League and seeing that and I'd love to be able to compete in one of those and win one of those. It's like a childhood dream. The Champions League, that's the coolest thing in the whole world! ""World Cups, Olympics, all the things at the international level are obviously very important, both with the U20s and then, hopefully, with the full team someday. ""My ultimate goal is I want to be the best player in the world, and that's what I strive for every day. ""I know It sounds like a lot, but it's just this exciting journey that I get to go after every day. I wouldn't want it to be any other way."" Big dreams for a girl who has already achieved unprecedented things. Can anyone or anything stop her from achieving them? Nothing has so far.

1810,Can women's football capitalise on Barcelona’s record-breaking Camp Nou Clasico?,"Talk to any American female footballer who is old enough to remember the 1999 Women’s World Cup and they will cite the final, played in front of 90,185 fans at the Rose Bowl in California, as an inspirational moment. Of course, that was the official record attendance for a women’s football match until Barcelona drew a crowd of 91,553 to Camp Nou for Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final clash with Real Madrid. It’s an achievement that cannot be applauded enough. The game, which Barca won 5-2 to progress to the semi-finals 8-3 on aggregate, sold out in three days and, with some of those tickets given away for free or a small fee, the club did an excellent job in ensuring people turned up. As well as hyping the game up massively with constant promotion, tapping into the reach of big personalities on the men’s side as part of that commercial push, there was a lot of engagement and encouragement to get those attending excited for the big event. Or, at the very least, remind them to pass on their tickets to someone else if they were unable to make it. All of this was built on the club's strong foundation of having already put the women front and centre of its marketing campaigns for a long time, as well as the incredible talent and success the side can boast. Indeed, it's no wonder so many fans wanted to attend, either, given Barca have been bringing its female players onto the Camp Nou pitch during men’s games for some time now, whenever they have a title or individual accolade to celebrate. Barcelona Femeni show off their league title at Camp Nou 🤩 pic.twitter.com/cKd2rGUxrE Wednesday night, then, was proof that the right mixture of marketing, communications, support and platform brings big results. Like the Rose Bowl, this will be a moment that many will talk about for years. Alexia Putellas, the 2021 Ballon d’Or winner whose face hangs from the Camp Nou on a banner sporting the words ‘La Reina’ ('The Queen'), said it would spark a new era and inspire young girls across the world. The challenge is for the women’s game to ensure that she is right. Before the outbreak of Covid-19, there was real momentum building in the sport. England welcomed 77,768 fans to Wembley for a friendly against Germany in late 2019, a few months after 60,739 people watched Atletico Madrid lose 2-0 to Barca at the Wanda Metropolitano. With the 2019 Women’s World Cup final attracting 57,900 fans in between those two games, three of the top five most attended women’s football matches before Wednesday’s record-breaker had come in 2019. The pandemic stunted the women's game's growth – but, as lockdowns and restrictions have been eased, momentum is building again. As well as Barca’s success, Paris Saint-Germain welcomed a record number of fans to watch its women’s team in the Champions League this week, with 27,262 at the Parc des Princes. Lyon also surpassed the 20,000 mark and both Wolfsburg and Bayern hit five figures. 🙌❤️💙 L'union d'une équipe et de ses supporters ! pic.twitter.com/iQtO7pQozD But there are still sobering numbers out there. Arsenal welcomed just 5,018 fans to the Emirates for last week’s game with Wolfsburg, despite the ground having a capacity of 60,260. The Arnold Clark Cup in England in February also attracted a total attendance of just 1,245 across the three games that the Lionesses weren’t involved in. Ahead of the Euros this summer, to be hosted by England, it was both concerning and disheartening to see just 249 people turn up to the tournament opener between Germany and Spain, some way away from the record-breaking Clasico crowed many of the latter would play in front of just a few weeks later. Not every game can be built up in the same way as a Barca-Madrid showdown at one of the most iconic stadiums in the world, of course, but there is a responsibility on those in the game now to ensure that Wednesday night does not prove a flash in the pan. Opportunities to play at a large stadium should be exploited to the maximum, while average attendances at the club’s usual grounds should be a big focus of growth. Building a loyal, regular fanbase is something that doesn’t make the headlines as much, but is almost even more important. Just @alexiaputellas on the drums after winning El Clasico at Camp Nou 🥁 pic.twitter.com/HKp0lxEAj2 Barca Femeni returned to its permanent home, the Estadi Johan Cruyff, on Saturday for a league game against Villarreal. The team attract between 3,000 and 4,000 fans there each week, a much bigger number than the 500 to 1,000 that watched them in their previous venue – the Mini Stadi, which was next to Camp Nou. At the weekend, 3,999 watched on as they won 6-1. Big moments like a Clasico are not just about making history and giving players an experience they absolutely deserve. They’re also about visibility and attracting more people on a regular basis. All the tools used to pack big stadia can be replicated in similar ways to steadily grow that audience. Barcelona sent a message this week to the whole world: if you create excitement and execute promotion well, you can be successful. They showed everyone that women's football is something that people care about. Now, it’s about how the rest of the sport responds. With the Euros this summer, then the World Cup next year, this was the perfect moment to have made such a statement. What's essential now, though, is that the women's game in its entirety reacts to the bar Wednesday night set - and that they do so in a way fitting of the show Barca put on.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/women-football-capitalise-barcelona-record-breaking-camp-nou/blt27b3002ba78c11e5,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1852,"AFC Women's Asian Cup 2022: Australia squad, fixtures, results, table, TV schedule and online streams","The AFC Women's Asian Cup 2022 is set to kick off on January 20, 2022 in India. The 2022 tournament has been expanded to 12 teams, with three groups comprising of four teams each. The top two teams will directly qualify for the quarter-final stage, while the two best third-placed teams will also progress.  While Japan are the defending champions, the Australian team are one of the favourites to win the tournament.  They have been drawn in Group B and will fight against Thailand, Philippines, and Indonesia in the round-robin stage.  Australia won the competition once in 2006 and are three-times runners-up.  The Matildas had a wonderful Olympic campaign in Tokyo where they finished fourth, their best-ever performance in the history of the tournament. Although they were placed in the supposed 'Group of Death' they navigated to the knockouts as one of the best third-placed teams. In the quarterfinals, they beat Great Britain with Ellen White scoring a hat-trick. The semifinal against Sweden broke television viewing records in Australia with 2.32 million viewers tuning in. However, they went down narrowly by a goal, and also saw Sam Kerr's goal disallowed.  Following their sojourn in Japan, they have played quality sides like Brazil and world number one United States in their own backyard as part of their preparations for the AFC Women's Asian Cup.  Tony Gustavsson has got an ideal blend of youth and experience in his squad. He handed 13 international debuts in 2021 and at the same time saw a record number of players reaching the 100th cap milestone, including skipper Sam Kerr.

1869,"Gucci, adidas Originals, and the future of football endorsement deals: Grealish, Williamson and Rashford lead the way","Earlier this year, the football rumour mill went into overdrive. Where this kind of speculation normally means a major signing or a manager on the verge of being sacked, this time it focused on a potential endorsement deal. According to those reports, Jack Grealish was poised to sign a  seven figure deal with Gucci that would make him an “official ambassador,” something described as “pretty much unprecedented for a sportsperson.” In May, Grealish appeared to confirm the rumours in an interview with The Face. While it may have seemed an unconventional move at the time, Grealish was keen to stress how deep his ties were with the Italian luxury house, telling the story of a Gucci wash bag his dad bought him as a present for joining the Aston Villa first team. “I was only 16,” he told the magazine. “It goes that far back!” The move doesn’t just make sense because of a 10 year old wash bag. Gucci is known for working with unexpected collaborators and ambassadors, and its “Friends of the House” often includes musicians (Harry Styles and Celeste), actors (Jared Leto and Dakota Johnson), artists (Ignasi Monreal and Coco Capitan) and chefs (Massimo Bottura). Even trainspotter Francis Bourgeois is a regular presence at their fashion shows. While this list shows how far and wide Gucci throws the net in terms of ambassadors, the signing of Grealish is still the first time they’ve worked with a footballer. This move, therefore, gives Gucci a formal entrance into a new market – complete with a direct line to Grealish’s rapidly growing 5.2 million Instagram followers – and the brand followed it up by signing Lionesses’ captain Leah Williamson in another “major deal.” Williamson was a special guest at the Gucci Cosmonogie show, sharing her behind-the-scenes pictures with i-D magazine. Both Grealish and Williamson were obviously partly signed due to their footballing abilities, but the sponsorship deals also hinge on who they are off pitch. Williamson is the leader of a new generation of footballers, and as well as now being a European Champion is also a powerful advocate for women and girls’ access to sports. This ties up with Gucci’s own “Chime for Change” program, described as “a global campaign to convene, unite and strengthen the voices speaking out for gender equality.” Grealish, on the other hand, has built a tight bond with fans through his down-to-earth approach, including his Premier League winning celebrations at the end of last season. Throughout his career, Grealish has been more outspoken, more up-for-a-laugh and more approachable than most Premier League or international footballers, something that would endear him to Gucci’s own ideals. In 2018, Harry Styles became the face of its tailoring campaign, with images showing him holding a chicken in his local chippy. If you had to think of one Premier League footballer willing to do that, you’d probably go for Grealish. In that sense then, both of these partnerships are driven by the players’ values rather than just their reach. Gucci isn't the first luxury brand to do this with football endorsements. One of the most high-profile examples is voice-of-his-generation Marcus Rashford, who signed with Burberry to “champion the power of giving back.” In the statement announcing the partnership, the London-based label said that Rashford’s “work to support the UK’s youth sits at the heart of our partnership and embodies our commitment to community and going beyond.” Away from the direct impact of Williamson and Grealish, Gucci’s decision to enter the footballing world also helps it lead in a growing area. The overlap between fashion and football has come a long way since David James modelled for Armani in 1995, and nowadays players often attend fashion shows, and sometimes participate themselves. Hector Bellerin, in many ways the OG of the new fashion-forward generation of footballers, walked for Louis Vuitton in 2019 and Trent Alexander-Arnold appeared in a Bottega Veneta campaign in 2021. And then there’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who has become a darling of most fashion magazines since he went to New York Fashion Week with Everton teammate Tom Davies in early 2020. This relationship extends to product as well. Brands have been keen to play with football aesthetics in their collections, most notably Balenciaga who’s football-influenced releases cover everything from black leather football boots to jerseys seemingly inspired by Borussia Dortmund away kits. Gucci also got in on the act with its adidas Originals collaboration earlier this year, which nodded to terrace culture and arrived in a campaign featuring Paul Pogba, Serge Gnabry, Jude Bellingham and David Alaba. Gucci’s partnerships with Grealish and Williamson therefore make sense in a number of different ways. On a surface level, it gives the Italian luxury house a foothold in the football industry, bringing credibility from two global talents who both have their own platforms and their own reach. Deeper than that, though, it allows Gucci to work with players who share their values. Both Grealish and Williamson are young, progressive and not scared of being themselves. In this sense, the partnership between these two footballers and one of the world’s biggest fashion houses is based on principles, not just reach. In an era where players feel more empowered than ever to stay true to themselves, this could be the future.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/gucci-adidas-originals-the-future-of-football-endorsement/blt71c0c106c515a927,Jack Stanley,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1904,'Dumornay is going to be one of the best players in the world' - How the NXGN 2022 winner is starring in France after leaving Haiti,"It was a bright summer’s day in north-western France, and almost 3,000 spectators were settling into their seats at the Stade de la Rabine for one of the final group stage matches of the 2018 Under-20 Women's World Cup, Germany vs Haiti. Among them was Amandine Miquel, head coach of Stade de Reims, and some members of her staff. Reims had a player, Helene Fercocq, competing in the tournament with France, and so the team had set up its pre-season training camp near the host cities. When the home nation was in action, the whole team would be in the stand supporting Fercocq, and when the staff had some time off, they would head out to other games, too. On this occasion, they were watching a Germany team touted for the title play against Haiti, debutantes at the tournament. The former, 3-2 winners in this match, were littered with stars already playing Frauen-Bundesliga football, but it was a Haitian player that made Miquel sit up and take notice. She was a commanding presence in the centre of midfield, despite being just four days away from her 15th birthday – her age meaning she required special authorisation to even compete in the tournament. She was facing players older and with more top-level experience than her, but you couldn’t tell. “She was way above the other players,” Miquel recalls to GOAL. “We immediately knew we needed that player.” The player in question was Melchie Dumornay, the women's winner of NXGN 2022. It has been almost four years since that game and, as time has passed, the hype around Dumornay has only grown. That is understandable given the teenager flew back to France soon after the tournament to trial with seven-time European champions Lyon, and the club liked her - but could not sign her because of her age. The hype was building up to her 18th birthday in the summer of 2021, when she would finally get the chance to put pen to paper on a contract abroad and show what she can do on a regular basis at the highest level. At home in Haiti, that excitement was particularly big. Speaking to GOAL back in August, a few weeks before her destination could be revealed, Dumornay said, with a laugh: “Many people now are like, 'Oh my god, you're moving soon. So, who is it? Paris Saint-Germain or Lyon?'” Around 50 clubs wanted Dumornay. Clubs in Asia wanted her. Clubs in Europe wanted her. Clubs in the United States wanted her. “We knew that the closer she got to being 18 years old, the more clubs would know what we already knew,” Miquel says. “We knew we had to keep contact with Haiti and with the player to have a chance that she might choose us when she was 18.” In the end, Durmonay would indeed choose Reims, a club renowned for its ability to nurture and develop young talents while offering them the chance to compete in one of Europe’s top leagues. The midfielder knew that, but the club also had to make itself stand out from others that could offer similar. “I think what made the difference was that we didn't stop taking news from her, information from Haiti, I was even supposed to go and meet her and her family and other players in Haiti, but I couldn't because of the situation there in 2019,” Miguel explains. “We were there all along and other clubs just came by at the last minute with bigger offers, obviously, but what we could offer to her in terms of time of playing, level of playing and also a team that is very close to her style - which is that we have a very young team with a lot of promising players that we try to get to their best level - [made the difference]. “She knew she would be in a good championship, but she would still be an important player and not just a substitute.” What a goal by the 16 year old! 🇭🇹 Melchie Dumornay puts it in the back of the net with just two minutes into the second half. #CWOQ #WeBelong @fhfhaiti pic.twitter.com/OcLBse9ArK The club have not stopped putting that attention and care in since Dumornay arrived at the end of the summer, either. The signing of fellow Haiti international Kethna Louis, who has been playing in France for four years now, has helped her adapt to the “simple things” in particular. “Her integration was very fast and very, very positive,” Sonia Ouchene, another of Reims’ rising talents who lives next-door to Durmonay, tells GOAL “She's still a bit of a baby, she's barely 18, so she still has that childlike side, that fun side. She'll annoy everyone, hide, play jokes. I hope she will keep this spirit. She brings good humour and it's a pleasure to work with girls like her. I think she has brought us even more cohesion. “I got to know her very quickly. She's quite an open person. You might think she's a bit shy, but in fact she's not. She opened up very quickly, she became part of the group very quickly. She talked to everyone, she asked questions to everyone, she was really interested in our lives and our group life. “I didn't know Melchie at all before she signed for Reims. I had never heard of her. I started to hear about her when the signing was about to happen. That's when I saw some videos of her and I read about her a bit. I haven't forgotten her since!” It was October 2, 2021, when Durmonay made her debut for Reims. She had been available for the previous week’s game against Montpellier but, having missed pre-season, Miquel wanted to make sure she had enough training under her belt before getting on the pitch. She started the game against Issy on the bench. At half-time, the scores were level at 1-1 and the coach turned to her new signing. “I told her that she didn't need a full game to score and make good passes,” Miquel remembers. She was right. On 73 minutes, Dumornay lifted a long ball over the Issy defence for Kessya Bussy to run onto, and the winger made the pass into the assist it deserved to be with a thumping finish past the goalkeeper. 2-1. Ten minutes later, Dumornay burst down the left wing and drilled an inch-perfect cross along the ground to find Bussy again, unmarked at the back post, who tapped it home. 3-1. The win was secure. “When we saw that we said, 'Oh my God, imagine what she can do in a full game! If only in that short time, she can do so much good',” Miquel says. On her first start, the following week, she was even better. Against Bordeaux, who finished in the Women’s Champions League spots last season, behind only Lyon and PSG, Dumornay was the best player on the pitch, scoring twice and providing another assist for Bussy. “Now everyone's calling me, huh?” Miquel laughs. “To get that player.” When most teenagers make such a big career move, to a foreign country no less, it usually takes them at least a little bit of time to adapt. Dumornay just has not needed that. Why? “Because she's way better than the other players,” Miquel replies, quite simply. “I think she's at 30 per cent of her level right now. For me, this is going to be one of the best players in the world in the next few years. “She's really far from her best level. She's going to continue to improve physically, technically and tactically. We'll do our best to get her through those steps and then she will sign to a big Champions League team and we will be very happy to watch her.” “I'm never surprised by players,” Ouchene adds. “There are really very, very few things that amaze me, and she is one of them, especially because of her age. “Athletically, she is powerful and fast. In the game, she's very clever. Technically, she has everything you need, although, of course, she's going to improve in every aspect. “She is a very complete player and she has shown it very quickly on the field.” 🔥😳 Goal @fhfhaiti 🇭🇹! Melchie Dumornay opens up the score with this magical free kick! Haiti now leads 1-0 over @miseleccionmx 🇲🇽. | #CU20W pic.twitter.com/kjUdBWN0Ol As was the case in the years before she signed for Reims, with Dumornay continuing to put in performances of this quality, her reputation and the interest in her will only grow. Reims and Miquel are well aware of that. “We take a lot of time to watch the players from all over the world. Maybe the difference with other clubs is that we're not scared of taking risks,” she says, with there many young talents in the squad with the Haiti international. “When we feel that the player has something different, even if she's very young or if maybe she's small, or she has got weakness because she doesn't have enough muscle... Some clubs tell you she's too small, she doesn't have enough muscle, we don't do this. We feel talent. “If we see a player that has talent, but some weakness, we know we will develop it and make a big player. “Now, I'm even sometimes refusing some players because I have all the parents, the agents of the best young players in France and in the world calling to come in our team, because they know that it's a very good experience for them and that we will take care of the players as if they were our own kids. It’s a global project, not just a football one. We develop the human being before the footballer. “We know at some point, when they're 20 or 21, they will sign to a bigger club, but that's our aim right now, to help those young players be seen and progress in a team, maybe with less pressure than in a big team because we're more focused on the individual development than on the results.” When speaking to GOAL last summer, Dumornay described playing for Lyon as the “absolute dream” she was working towards – but it is what she wants to do for her home nation if she is successful that speaks wonders of who she is, beyond the football pitch. “I want to be able to open an academy back home in Haiti to provide opportunities to players that I didn't have myself,” she explained. “In Haiti, there are so many talents, not only in soccer, that just don't get a chance. I got that chance to be in an academy, but there are top players and top talents everywhere. I hope that one day more people get the chance to get out of there.” “She's very intelligent, very mature,” Miquel adds. “She knows where she wants to go. She knows how to do it. She knew that she had to sign to a smaller club and not the big club straight away. I think she's dealing with her career with a lot of intelligence. “Some people have the qualities but will not make it. But she has the qualities and the intelligence to know what to do. That's why I'm pretty confident that she will make a very big career.” She may have only just began her professional career, but there are few doubts that Dumornay is on her way to the very top. What the future has in store for the NXGN 2022 winner is sure to be special.

1917,When is the Champions League final? Liverpool vs Real Madrid follows thrilling Lyon vs Barcelona match,"After last weekend's absorbing UEFA Women's Champions League final between Barcelona and Lyon in Turin, now it's time for the men's main event in Paris.  Liverpool will take on Real Madrid in a repeat of the 2018 Champions League final, which was marred by Mohamed Salah's early injury but illuminated by the Gareth Bale wonder-goal that sealed a third consecutive triumph for los Blancos, and a 13th overall. The Reds have every reason to be confident of gaining revenge for that 3-1 loss in Kyiv, given they have won every single away game on the road to Paris. But one can never, ever write off Madrid, who have pulled off one miraculous comeback after another on one of the most thrilling runs to the final the Champions League has ever seen. Drama, then, is guaranteed Drama in this clash between two of the European game's traditional super-powers.  Liverpool's eagerly-awaited rematch with Madrid will kick off on Saturday, May 28 at 2000 BST/1500 ET. The game will be broadcast by BT Sport in the United Kingdom, while American viewers will be able to follow the action on CBS, in English, and Univision, in Spanish. The Champions League final will be staged at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, a northern suburb of Paris. The 80,000-seater arena has staged two previous tournament deciders: Madrid's 3-0 rout of Valencia in an all-Spanish affair in 2000; and Barcelona's 2-1 victory over Arsenal in 2006. However, it is worth noting that the last time Liverpool met Madrid in a European Cup final in Paris, in 1981 at the Parc des Princes, the Merseysiders' triumphed 1-0 thanks to Alan Kennedy's late goal. Madrid are the most successful side in Champions League history, having conquered the continent on 13 occasions.  They are also bidding for what would be a fifth title in the past eight years and can still call upon many of the players that helped them win three in a row between 2016 and 2018, including Luka Modric, Toni Kroos, Casemiro, Dani Carvajal and, of course, Karim Benzema. Bale, Marcelo, Lucas Vazquez and Nacho are also likely to be on the bench. It was the introduction of Bale which turned the 2018 final against Liverpool, with the Welshman netting a spectacular overhead kick less than two minutes after coming on to put Madrid 2-1 up before sealing victory with a speculative shot from distance that Loris Karius spilled. However, the Reds have improved exponentially since that painful night and it is they who are bookmakers' favourites to prevail in Paris.  Liverpool put their 2018 defeat behind them as quickly as possible by returning to the final 12 months later to clinch their sixth European Cup with a 2-0 defeat of Tottenham. The following year, they ended their 30-year English title drought by winning the Premier League by a whopping 17 points from second-placed Manchester City. Injuries to key players such as Virgil van Dijk derailed their 2020-21 campaign – during which they were knocked out of the Champions League 3-1 on aggregate by Madrid. However, having made a couple of shrewd signings in Ibrahima Konate and Luis Diaz, Liverpool now boast what Jurgen Klopp has admitted is his strongest ever squad. Salah admitted before the second leg of Madrid's semi-final with City that he wanted to play the Spanish side in Saint Denis and then, after the fixture had been confirmed, he tweeted: ""We have a score to settle."" The Egyptian's declaration drew criticism from some quarters, on the grounds that it might serve as added motivation for Madrid, but his preference was understandable. After all, Salah was forced off just half an hour into the 2019 final with a shoulder injury sustained after a controversial tangle with former Madrid captain Sergio Ramos. Klopp was in no doubt that the centre-half had deliberately wrapped up Salah's arm and dragged him to the ground, accusing Ramos of acting ""like a wrestler"". “Ramos said a lot of things afterwards that I didn’t like,” the Reds boss told reporters. “As a person, I didn’t like his reaction. He was like: ‘Whatever, what do they want? It’s normal.’ No, it is not normal.” Ramos has always maintained that he did nothing wrong. At the time, he posted on social media: “Sometimes football shows you its good side and others the bad. Above all we are fellow pros. Get well soon, Salah. The future awaits you.” As for Salah himself, he stated: “It was a very tough night, but I’m a fighter."" And now he will get another chance to go toe to toe with Madrid in a Champions League final. Salah, of course, will also be hoping to advance his Ballon d'Or cause by lighting up the final and he's certainly one of the leading contenders, given the role he's played in Liverpool's fantastic season. However, many believe that this year's trophy will go to either Sadio Mane or Benzema, given the integral roles they've played in their respective teams' runs to the Champions League final. Benzema, of course, is the tournament's leading goalscorer, with 15 goals in just 11 games. The Frenchman has been on fire in the knockout stage, netting in five consecutive matches, a brilliant run of form that has featured hat-tricks against both Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea. 2022 belongs to Karim Benzema. pic.twitter.com/S4hctHGXpm However, Mane has been decisive for Liverpool, scoring in both legs of their semi-final win over Villarreal. It's also worth remembering that the Senegalese superstar also fired his country to a first Africa Cup of Nations triumph earlier this year, with Mane netting the decisive penalty in the shootout success over Egypt. The winger then repeated the feat in Senegal's World Cup qualifying play-off with the same side, which is why some believe Champions League glory would result in Mane becoming just the second African after George Weah to win the Ballon d'Or. Lyon re-established themselves as the dominant force in women's football with a stunning 3-1 victory over Barcelona in Turin.  A number of the French side's players had admitted beforehand that they had been irked by the suggestion that their Catalan rivals had re-invented the game while winning a treble last season, and they certainly seemed keen to prove a point. Indeed, Lyon raced into a 3-0 lead inside 33 minutes, with Amandine Henry, Ada Hegerberg and Catarina Macario all on target. Barcelona captain pulled one back for Barca shortly before the break, with a strike that saw the Blaugranes captain finish the tournament as top scorer with 11 goals, but there was to be no dramatic second-half turnaround. Consequently, Lyon cemented their status as arguably the greatest dynasty in Champions League history by lifting the trophy for an eighth time in just 11 years.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/champions-league-final-liverpool-real-madrid/blt88cf79472b8cbcf2,Mark Doyle,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1925,Canada & Liverpool keeper Foster focused on full recovery after horrific car accident left her fearing she would never play football again,"Canada and Liverpool women's goalkeeper Rylee Foster says she is focused on making a full recovery after being involved in a horrific car accident that left her fearing she would never play football again. Foster was in a road traffic accident while away visiting friends in Finland during the November international break and suffered a number of injuries, including seven fractures to her neck. The 23-year-old was subsequently fitted with a special halo device to keep her neck mobilised and initially worried that her career may have to come to a premature end, but her prognosis is looking far more positive after a recent scan. Doctors have confirmed that Foster's fractures are knitting together naturally with the help of the halo, which she will soon be able to remove if her recovery continues to run smoothly. The Canada youth international has been present at Liverpool's recent games to cheer on her team-mates and is optimistic of joining them back on the pitch in the future after a serious health scare. An inspiration to us all ❤This is the emotional story of @_ryleefoster's continuing recovery, following a serious road traffic accident back in October... pic.twitter.com/JOGh6fQtHs “I was told that I would never play again, I would never really have a quality life again,"" Foster told Liverpool's   ""And I found out the other day that my bones are almost fully fused and they’re going to be removing the halo device on March 1. “From there I can start the rehab process. There’s going to be a lot of rehabilitation needed to get back to just a normal, quality active lifestyle. “When I told Matt [Beard] the other day that I could make a full recovery he made me make one promise and that was to be patient with the process and that’s just what I want to do. “It’s just about enjoying the moment and taking every step at a time. I’m going to be at every game possible, I just want to be there at every game to support the girls as long as I can. “So I’ll be at every game - and in a few weeks without a cage on my head so it’s exciting!” Foster began her career with a four-year stint on West Virginia University's books, recording 39 clean sheets in 84 appearances. The talented young keeper was snapped up by Liverpool in January 2020, and made her debut in a Continental Cup win over Manchester United nine months later. Foster, who has won nine caps for Canada's U20s, now has five senior outings for the Reds to her name and was handed a new long-term contract in March last year.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/canada-liverpool-keeper-foster-full-recovery-horrific-car/blt357587b3b9cdb6ed,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1928,Football came home! Wiegman and England's Lionesses win the Women's Euros and become immortal at Wembley,"“We don’t fear anyone.” Those were the words of England head coach Sarina Wiegman ahead of the Women’s Euros final, as her team prepared to come up against its old foe, the team it had lost to on so many occasions – Germany. There are several reasons why that is the genuine truth about the Lionesses and not just some empty words. The investment in the game in England, the growth and development of it, has been massive. The exposure to the highest level and the fact they’ve been so many top teams is another factor. But among the biggest reasons has been the woman who uttered those words herself – Wiegman, the coach that, on Sunday evening, led England’s women’s team to its first ever major title. She’s now coached this side 20 times since she took over. She’s yet to taste defeat. The old saying is that Germany always win. Often, that is true. They’ve won the Women’s Euros eight times, the World Cup twice and clubs representing the nation have won nine Women’s Champions League titles – more than any other country. But on this occasion, they were on the losing side of a final, Chloe Kelly stabbing the ball into the back of the net after an extra time goalmouth scramble in front of a raucous but nervous Wembley crowd – the attendance of 87,192 a new record for the competition. That it was Kelly who scores the goal was fitting in a way. The Manchester City winger has been one of Wiegman’s ‘super subs’ throughout the summer, the Dutchwoman becoming the first coach in history to name an unchanged team for every single game in a Women’s Euros despite numerous calls for her to make changes. That’s because of how effective those players off the bench, like Kelly, have been. Ella Toone scored England’s first goal on Sunday, a lovely finish lifted over the onrushing Merle Frohms that initially gave the hosts the lead. She has been outstanding this summer – as has Alessia Russo, the go-to sub for starting No.9 Ellen White scoring twice as many goals as her team-mate in the tournament. But this is what Wiegman did in 2017, when she won the Euros with the Netherlands. This is what she did in 2019, when she reached the World Cup final with her native country. It works and it worked again this time. That consistency and rhythm was crucial to this triumphant success – but she wasn’t brought in by the Football Association because she plays the same XI a lot. What Wiegman has brought to this team has made a difference – it’s won them a major trophy. She’s calm. She’s composed. She gives the players belief but she doesn’t let the highs be too high. “Sarina has been brilliant,” Jill Scott, the midfielder who became the first England player to play in two major tournament finals on Sunday, having featured in the 2009 Euros defeat to Germany, said earlier this week. “She’s an incredible woman. She’s very logical. She doesn’t allow us to overthink and keeps everything to the task and keeps us focused. I don’t think she realises how good she is actually! “She is so calm on the side and she knows what we need to do to win. She is the driving force behind the reasons the team is in the final.” England needed all of that this summer. The hysteria around the team has been incredible. The support of the nation beyond anything these players have experienced before. They’d never been in this moment. Scott was the only one to play in a Euros final, but even that was a world away from this. It was at Wembley. It was a sold-out crowd. It was huge. Yet, in the build-up to this game, there was such a relaxed feeling. “None of us have been in this position before,” Leah Williamson, the England captain, said before the game. “The opportunity I've had for growth in this tournament has given me confidence. I think I'll be ready for whatever emotions come my way tomorrow."" At full-time, she was in tears – as were so many of her team-mates. They made history. They did it on the biggest stage, amid the highest pressure. They changed women’s football forever this summer off the pitch, but they also became immortal on it. They brought football home.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/football-came-home-wiegman-and-england-s-lionesses-win-the-women-/blt03e1306009078090,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

2012,‘I didn’t realise how big winning the Champions League was at 19’ - Bayern star Damnjanovic chasing another UWCL dream,"Jovana Damnjanovic wasn’t on the pitch when Bayern Munich were last in the knockout rounds of the Women’s Champions League, but she remembers it well. It was last season’s semi-finals and the German giants travelled to London with a 2-1 advantage over Chelsea from the first leg.  At full-time, that had evaporated. The Blues ran out 4-1 winners and booked their place in the final. Damnjanovic was nine months into her ACL recovery at that point and while her rehab would be setback-free, it was these moments that were difficult for the Bayern striker. “I think the hardest thing actually, for me, was – especially at the end of the season – seeing the team struggling, especially, for example, against Chelsea or some games at the end and you're not able to help them,” she tells GOAL. “You're there, you're screaming, you're trying to be loud, to motivate them, but you cannot actually do anything on the field.  ""I mean, the players said it was amazing, that they heard me the whole time, but still just not being there, not being able to tackle someone, to score the goal, to do whatever, I think that was actually the hardest moment for me.” Fast forward almost a year and Bayern are back in UWCL knockout action this week, taking on French champions Paris Saint-Germain in the quarter-finals on Tuesday. This time, Damnjanovic can play the role she wants. She made her return from injury back in pre-season and says she feels ""even better"" now. ""I feel like I was never injured."" The Serbia international, Bayern’s main source of goals in the season before being sidelined, has returned to stern competition for her place, though, in the form of Lea Schuller.  Signed from Essen last summer, she took on the goalscoring burden in Damnjanovic’s absence, netting 16 times as the team won its first league title in five years. The relationship between the pair is not like it is for most players fighting for the same shirt, though.  When Damnjanovic was substituted at half time against Cologne this month, Schuller took her place with the game goalless and went on to score a hat-trick. She ran straight to her fellow striker to celebrate. “I came to her at half-time and said, 'Come on, bro, you're going to score twice today' – and then she scored three,” Damnjanovic explains. “After the third goal, she ran to me and we celebrated together. “It's always great to have somebody who is pushing you to be even better. I think that is also great for her, and that's also great for me. “Sometimes, she's playing; sometimes, I'm playing, but we are always supporting each other, 100 per cent.  ""I'm super happy when she scores. She's super happy when I score. For us, that's just a normal thing.  ""It's funny that people are always surprised when they see that we understand each other that well.” Damnjanovic knows where that unity can take a team.  Before she signed for Bayern, she was playing for Sand, a small club in the south of Germany with resources nowhere near what the German champions have. Yet, the team reached the DFB-Pokal final two years in a row. “We didn't have such a strong team in Sand, like other teams, or amazing players. But I realised when you have a good group of people and when everybody is investing 105 per cent, you are going to be able to reach amazing things,"" she remembers.  “In those two years, we beat Bayern, we beat Wolfsburg, we beat everybody, literally. “When people are believing in you and you believe in your team, I think everything is possible.” There are a lot of exciting possibilities for Bayern in these coming weeks. They are locked in an intense title race with Wolfsburg, the team they took the league crown from last year and also the team they will face in the semi-finals of the cup. It was with Wolfsburg that Damnjanovic got her first taste of German football and her first experience outside of Serbia, joining the club as a teenager. She would leave to play regular football with Sand after two seasons, but what she learned from training alongside such great players was huge. The spell also brought her a Champions League winners’ medal, in 2014. “I didn't realise how big that was, at that time."" she admits. ""I thought, 'Okay, cool. I'm 19. It's my first season in the Champions League. I won it', you know? Then, you get a reality check and just realise, 'Oh, it's not that easy at all'.” To get the chance to win it again with Bayern then, what would that mean?  “I couldn't even compare it with anything,” she says, after pausing to imagine it. “With this team, with this group of girls and people, it sounds stupid but we are not just team-mates. We are way more than that.  ""I couldn't be happier than to win the Champions League with this group. Every single one of them is amazing in their special way. Not just like two of them – all of them.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/champions-league-bayern-damnjanovic-chasing-uwcl/bltb70528fc32229241,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2021,Nike and Tottenham Hotspur unveil their 2022-23 third kit,"We've been waiting for Spurs to reveal their new 2022-23 third kit, and it's a beauty. Similar to last year's third kit release, this goes for a bold all-over print, and already has fans buzzing to see Antonio Conte's team hammering the opposition 5-0 at White Hart Lane looking very fresh indeed.  The wavey print does all the talking. The third shirt's striking turquoise lets the mystic navy graphics dominate, finished with a simple black border on the collar and cuffs. Inspired by Tottenham's ever-evolving DNA and the fan-favourite Nike TN trainer, the graphics are a nod to the strong relationship between the club and brand, solidifying Spurs as one of the most fashion-forward clubs in London.  For the first time ever in the club's history, the women's team will debut the striking new third kit during this Sunday's opening game of The Women's Cup against Club America in Louisville, Kentucky. A notable first and another step in the right direction for women's football.  The Tottenham 2022-23 third kit collection is available to buy right now from the Spurs Shop and Nike.

2028,"England have potentially underachieved in the last few tournaments, says Lionesses captain Williamson","England have “potentially underachieved” in their most recent tournament outings, believes captain Leah Williamson, who insists the team are eager to “turn that around” ahead of this summer’s Euros. Sarina Wiegman’s side will begin their preparation for that tournament, to be played on English soil, with this month’s Arnold Clark Cup, taking on three elite opponents in Spain, Germany and Canada. The latter, Olympic gold medallists, are up first on Thursday evening in Middlesbrough, with Williamson and her side eager to get off to a good start and outline their title credentials. In Wednesday’s pre-match press conference, the Arsenal defender was asked what differences she has noticed in the England team since Wiegman took over in August. “I think the dynamic of the team has changed a little bit,” she said. “I think we've realised, ultimately, we've potentially underachieved the last few tournaments and I think everybody wants to turn that around. “It's more of a collective push to reach the next standard, which is bringing out the best in everybody, I think. This is some of the most competitive training I've been involved in for a long time here. The fight for positions, the fight to reach your potential, it's all tying in nicely. “Then obviously this week, we get an opportunity to learn more about ourselves which is a gift really, just to focus on the summer.” Looking ahead to the summer, England will be considered one of the contenders for the tournament, alongside the likes of Spain, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and many others. Asked about this team going into the Euros believing they can win it, Wiegman - who lifted the trophy in 2017 with the Netherlands - said: “When you go to a tournament, you want to win the tournament, just like all other teams. “There are lots of teams that would be able, or should be able to, win the Euros because the game has developed so much. I think now, more and more countries are the favourites in this tournament. It's going to be really exciting. “I think the games are going to be, again, on a higher level than the tournament four years ago or the World Cup, where the European teams played too. That's going to be really exciting. “But I think we have a plan. We now have this tournament which we really need to know where we are at this point and what we need to do to become better as an individual and as a team. “Then, hopefully - well I'm convinced - that [we'll be] ready on July 6 and then we should be playing at the best we can.” Tickets to watch England, Germany, Spain and Canada play in the Arnold Clark Cup are available now.

2060,'I love my club' - Chelsea Women manager Hayes' response after Cuthbert's jokey 'when your drunk mate wants a fight' tweet,"Chelsea Women manager Emma Hayes responded to Erin Cuthbert's jokey ""when your drunk mate wants a fight"" tweet by saying ""I love my club"" and ""I'm just looking after my mates"". Hayes watched her side keep the pressure on Arsenal at the top of the Women's Super League (WSL) with a 1-0 home victory over Aston Villa on Sunday. The relief of the players was clear to see after Sam Kerr's stoppage-time winner, with the Blues now only five points behind the Gunners with two games in hand. Chelsea celebrated wildly after scoring, and Hayes even joined in, but an unfortunate screenshot then began doing the rounds on social media. Midfielder Cuthbert posted the image of Hayes appearing to hold off one of her players while squaring up to another with the caption: ""When your drunk mate wants a fight but you just want to get in the club already."" The Blues star included a laughing emoji in her post, and Hayes later responded to Cuthbert's tweet. ""I’m just looking after my mates,"" the Chelsea boss tweeted. ""Our fans at the 90th minute singing for the team will live with me forever. ""We’ve got you and you’ve got us. I love my club."" I’m just looking after my mates. Our fans at the 90th minute singing for the team will live with me forever. We’ve got you and you’ve got us. I love my club. https://t.co/6Zc7COyhoB The extra passion from Hayes and the Chelsea squad along with the supporters in attendance at Kingsmeadow came on the back of a turbulent week for the club. The Blues have been plunged into financial uncertainty due to the UK government's decision to sanction owner Roman Abramovich amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Only season-ticket holders were able to attend the latest Chelsea Women fixture as a result, with Hayes having spoken out on the situation after their previous outing away at West Ham. ""For all the questions everyone has, players, fans, staff, we have to give the club time to work through that,"" she said. ""From my end, I'm a leader of this team and we're going to have to navigate a difficult period and one where I don't have all the answers for it.  ""I have an amazing dressing room, amazing fans and amazing employees at the club that deserve the very best for us.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/i-love-my-club-chelsea-women-manager-hayes-cuthbert-when/blte86cfc79235fa902,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2063,Chelsea takeover candidate Pagliuca meets supporters groups after criticism,"Chelsea ownership candidate Stephen Pagliuca finally met with fan groups, including the Supporters' Trust, Women's Supporters Trust and Chelsea Pitch Owners, over the weekend.  The Boston Celtics and Atalanta co-owner was subject to criticism in a statement by supporters after failing to meet those stakeholders before making his final bid on Thursday evening.  However, he has quickly moved to reassure supporters which sees him jointly lead a bid with Canadian sports mogul Larry Tanenbaum.  The bid initially acknowledged it hasn't been able to be as transparent as the others due to the late nature of its offer, addressing concerns in the Chelsea supporter group's joint statement.  ""We are disappointed that the late announcement of the bid from the Pagliuca consortium has meant it has been difficult to engage meaningfully with them. Whilst initial contact has been made with some groups, this bid has not yet spoken in length with any of the aforementioned supporter groups,"" the group said last week. Pagliuca explained both his and Tenenbaum's vision and experience in running sports teams, including their various interests in football itself.  They spoke about plans to build a ""world class stadium for a world class team"", their desire to keep the men's and women's teams well-funded, alongside presenting examples from their other sports teams regarding charitable community efforts. They also committed not to join the European Super League and their willingness to allow a 10 percent fan share in the club. It comes after the John Terry-led True Blues consortium, which was first revealed as a player in the process by GOAL, having already endorsed them after discussions with all of the various groups.  Deadline for final bids is todayWe are optimistic that the successful bidder will implement expectations of the CST & its membershipFurther reassurance is required from the bid led by Stephen PagliucaFull Statement ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/Xi0kvUUctt There are many similarities between the offerings of the Todd Boehly-led and Sir Martin Broughton-led consortiums.  It is understood however that while Broughton's group is open to working with the True Blues consortium, the Boehly bid has given little indication of interest at this stage.  According to sportico, Boehly and Broughton-backer and Crystal Palace investor Josh Harris are among five groups in the running to buy US sports franchise Denver Broncos.  Pagliuca was also invited to join the race but declined to focus on his efforts to buy the Blues for what it is estimated will cost more than £2.5 billion ($3.2bn), making it the most expensive sports team transaction in history.  There were expected to be four options but the Ricketts-Griffin-Gilbert Group pulled out at the eleventh hour. Several sources have suggested that they hope the process will be concluded this week, with New York investment bank Raine Group advising the process and Chelsea's board to decide who ultimately wins the bid. ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-takeover-candidate-pagliuca-meets-supporters-groups/blt50e131d1b9f589d6,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2132,Why the Women's Euros has to change the game forever,"It was the day before the 2022 Women’s Euros final and Svenja Huth was the player put up for Germany’s pre-match press conference. As she took her seat at the top table, she looked ahead and saw a room packed with media – not a single seat spare. She grabbed her phone and took a picture. Huth has won the Euros before, she has won two Champions League titles and an Olympic gold medal. But even she was taken aback by the sight. It was a moment that perfectly encapsulated what a defining summer it has been for the sport. There has been a lot of talk about what this record-breaking tournament could do for England. After they beat Germany in the final, thanks to Chloe Kelly's extra-time strike, there is even more excitement about what is next for the domestic game. The hosts have drawn the biggest crowds – including the record-breaker in the final – and the perception of the Lionesses in the eyes of the public has changed massively over the course of their run to the final. Murals have been painted up and down of the country of the players. Beers have been named after them. There are football fans all over England with the names of these women on their shirts. Before, it was common to see young girls with Lucy Bronze or Fran Kirby printed on their backs. Now, you see people of all ages sporting as much, with men in pubs singing ‘Beth Mead’s on fire’. This hasn’t happened before. “I think what we've seen is that this hasn't just been a change for women's football, but society in general,” England captain Leah Williamson said on Saturday, the day before final. “Tomorrow is not the end of the journey, but the start of one. We've really started something. I want this to be a mark for the future.” History being made ❤️ pic.twitter.com/oj477iFRaq But it is not just in England where things should change. Record television audiences have been seen all over Europe, with millions tuning in to watch their respective nations compete in the continent’s biggest competition. The press boxes even for games involving less-developed nations in the sport have been packed, with coverage of the tournament more wide-reaching and comprehensive than ever before. The number of travelling fans has been immense, too. Before the tournament, Kayleigh Grieve, who works in women's football marketing and sponsorship at UEFA, spoke to the Footballco Business Podcast about criticisms of the size of the event’s stadia. “We also haven't quite got to [a point yet] where we have huge travelling fans behind women's football,” she said, outlining the factors behind the choice of venues. “I think the Women's Champions League final was the first time we saw with Barcelona, a huge swathe of people coming to an away game and travelling for that.” This summer has seen a huge change in that respect. Each nation has always had its dedicated fans, but the numbers have grown massively this time around. The yellow of Sweden has taken over whole streets, the Netherlands’ party bus made its way to England as it did to France for the 2019 World Cup, and Iceland fans turned the Manchester City Academy stadium into – as the family of one player described it – the team’s own little home. It means we have seen record after record broken. The figure for the highest attendance for a non-host game at the Euros was initially smashed on the third day of the tournament, as Spain beat Finland, before being bettered three more times - the Germany vs France semi-final crowd now holding the record. It took just nine days for this to become the most attended Women’s Euros of all time, too. Yet, there is still room to improve. Arguments over the size of stadia have rumbled on throughout the summer and will no doubt have an impact going forward, with the host of the 2025 edition still to be decided. When the venues were picked in 2017, choosing smaller grounds might have seemed appropriate for where the game was then, but the progress has accelerated in such a way that some players were struggling to even get tickets for their families this summer. The development will only continue at that rapid rate now, but it should not just be at this highest level. It should not just be that when the World Cup comes around next summer, or the Euros return in three years, that people get excited. This moment should be capitalised on to improve the women’s game as a whole. It means everything 🥺 pic.twitter.com/l9fNTwjC2J Imagine the impact that Belgium’s historic run to a first quarter-final could have, for example. The star of their tournament was Nicky Evrard – a goalkeeper who is still not a full-time footballer. Even Germany, the eight-time European champions, have a league that is still not fully professional. Some grounds in the Frauen-Bundesliga don’t even have scoreboards. England might have had a sold-out Wembley Stadium cheering for them on Sunday, but the Women’s Super League is still looking to hit average attendances of just 6,000 by 2024. This tournament should be celebrated for the success it has been, of course. But it should also serve to highlight some of the shortcomings that exist on a day-to-day basis in the women’s game. “It's not just an event that’s here and everybody is happy about it. Something has to continue,” Germany head coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg pondered. “There has to be the chance for countries to make the next steps in women's football. “If not now, when will it happen?”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/womens-euros-change-game-forever/bltdb93c0bc76c52ce9,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

The Lionesses went into the game knowing that they could take the title over Spain if they triumphed and scored more than once.  While they were left to sweat, Bright eventually settled the match in their favour as they went on to win 3-1.  England drew their first two games in the Cup against Canada and Spain, the latter of who took five points from their three fixtures to lead the table going into the final match.  A win guaranteed the hosts a share of the summit, but to overtake Spain on goals scored Sarina Wiegman's charges had to prevail and net at least twice.  Ellen White got the Lionesses off to a perfect start by opening the scoring after just 15 minutes, but Germany fought back with an equaliser late in the first half.  🚀 WOW, what a goal to equal the game from Germany!

Shiels' words have been widely condemned in the subsequent period and now the ex-Kilmarnock and Derry City boss has expressed his regret over what he said. ""I wish to apologise for my comments made in the post-match press conference last night. I am sorry for the offence that they have caused,"" Shiels said on Wednesday. ""Last night was a special occasion for the women's game in Northern Ireland and I am proud to manage a group of players who are role models for so many girls, and boys, across the country.

Shiels' controversial words came in the wake of a humiliating defeat for his side in front of a record crowd in Belfast, as the Lionesses put their neighbours to the sword in a five-goal thrashing. His analysis was met with an immediate backlash across the game, with former Arsenal and England star Ian Wright brandishing him as ""foolish"" for bringing gender into the conversation. Former Arsenal and Northern Ireland goalkeeper Emma Byrne also slammed the comments, telling Off the Ball: “I’d be surprised if he is the manager for the next game to be honest. “You can’t discriminate like that, it’s the one thing you don’t need in women’s football when it’s on the momentum, the trajectory (it is).""

2247,"'Wiegman is amazing!' - Lionesses boss could manage in men's game after Euros triumph, claims Hayes","Emma Hayes has insisted that Sarina Wiegman could manage in the men's game after leading England's Lionesses side to Euro 2022 glory. England Women delivered the country's first trophy since the 1966 World Cup as Chloe Kelly's goal in the extra time sealed a memorable victory against Germany in the final at Wembley.  Chelsea boss Hayes was hugely impressed by the way Wiegman conducted herself throughout the tournament and hopes England's success can pave the way for a more ""equal footing"" in terms of coaching in the men's and women's games. Wiegman has now achieved back-to-back European Championship successes, having previously won the trophy with her native Netherlands in 2017.  Hayes sees no reason why the Dutch tactician can't work in men's football in the future, as she told the PA news agency: ""She is an amazing manager. It’s the same sport, she just manages women rather than men at an extremely high level. “I think some of the opinions in and around whether women could do that job are absolute nonsense. Of course, she could do the job. I think it is time for a lot of things to be on more of an equal footing."" Sarina and the UEFA Women's European Championship trophy: a match made in heaven ❤️ pic.twitter.com/ME0i6mlLts Hayes feels that it is high time for wholesale changes to take place and says there should be a systematic investment in female coaches as well.  ""For me, there has to be an increase in investment across the game, and when it comes to coaching into the men’s game it has to be a pre-requisite for successful teams. I think it is time for those changes to happen,"" she said. ""You’ve got to invest in not only free access for the kids, but also coaching, because seeing Sarina on the touchline last night I think is immense for any young girl who aspires to grow up being a coach. We need to invest in female coaches as well."" Hayes was extremely emotional while commentating from the sidelines after the win at Wembley and says it will take a while for her to process England's achievement. “I think I have been crying the whole morning. I don’t think I can take it in,” she said.  ""Everybody in this country has worked so hard for a number of years to get to this point, and the fact that team did what they did on home soil in front of a packed crowd at Wembley, it is what dreams are made of. “They have inspired a nation. Everyone is in love with that team for the right reasons. They are winners, and they are so deserving of everything that is going to come their way.  ""It is important for them to enjoy it today, this week, and the next few weeks because what they have done deserves a celebration of this magnitude."" Winners. No more needs to be said.

2250,Saudi Media made 'competitive' offer to buy Chelsea from Abramovich one hour before deadline,"Saudi Media made an offer to New York investment bank Raine Group to buy Chelsea, just an hour ahead of the deadline, GOAL can confirm.  The private consortium headed by businessman Mohamed Alkhereiji believes their offer is competitive, including plans to redesign Stamford Bridge and renew the contracts of key first team players, including Antonio Rudiger.  They now await on the decision, which is being guided by Raine but involves the sanctioned club owner Roman Abramovich and senior Chelsea staff.  Saudi Media have promised to invest heavily in the club and bring their expertise in football, stadiums and advertising to the table.  They will seek new sponsors for the club after decisions by telecoms company Three and car company Hyundai to suspend their lucrative deals after seeing Abramovich sanctioned for his connections to Russia amid the ongoing Ukraine crisis. They have vowed to invest in the women's team and have a strategy to use the squad as ambassadors for sport in the Middle East, while the group desire to complete any deal quickly to help lift cash flow issues that are impacting Chelsea's existence amid the sanctions laid down by the UK government. Saudi Media had not wished to go public about their bid until the final decision phase from Raine, but the bid sought to clarify details after reports emerged citing them as a candidate for ownership. Raine are currently poring over hundreds of pages of documents relating to the sale of Chelsea FC as they aim to whittle down the field of candidates.  They are hoping to have rejections and approvals ready for Monday morning, allowing three or four bids to proceed to the next stage.  Then, the remaining bidders will see their plans presented to the Premier League and assessed by the latter's legal team.  Chelsea's senior staff are keen to see any bid go through before the next match against Brentford which takes place on April 2 at Stamford Bridge, in order to smooth a transition into the final weeks of the season.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/saudi-media-competitive-offer-buy-chelsea-abramovich-one/blt68bf82067ec93451,By Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

2269,Esmee Brugts: Dutch teen ready to take the Women's Euros by storm,"When you walk into the clubhouse of FC Binnenmaas, the Dutch amateur football club in Maasdam, you will see a PSV Eindhoven shirt. The small village club is situated around 100 kilometres from the city of Eindhoven, so the link is not geographical, but instead related to the most famous of its alumni: Esmee Brugts. Two years ago, Brugts was playing in the boys’ teams here. Today, the 18-year-old – who can play as a left-winger or as a No.10 – is a full Netherlands international and representing her country at this summer’s Women’s European Championship as the Oranje bid to retain the title they won in 2017. It has been quite the rise. In fact, Marius Heinerman – Brugts’ coach at Binnenmaas – gets emotional recounting the four years the pair spent together before her big move, with them still in regular contact today as she ascends to new heights. Brugts was playing for SV Heinenoord, the club of her home village, when Heinerman first spotted her. A year would pass before Binnenmaas finally got the talented forward to join, but she was worth the wait. Asked what made her stand out, Heinerman doesn’t hesitate. “Her mentality,” he responds. “She always wanted to give her best. Even when the season ended, she still wanted to train. “With the boys, when we lost a game, she was always critical of herself. ‘That must be better. That must be better. That must be better.'"" It was that constant pursuit of perfection which made her a real battler on the pitch – “She always went into a fight with the boys to get the ball” – while her technical skills were immediately apparent. “Her footwork is very good. Every ball she takes, it's under control,” Heinerman adds. That talent didn’t take long to grab the attention of the Dutch Football Association. “She was always just very technical and always went past her defenders very easily, scored very easily,” Maxime Snellenberg – who first played with her now-PSV team-mate in the youth national teams at Under-14s level – tells GOAL. “When she went with the U16s to another tournament, that showed that she was already better than our age group. She really was the best, I think, from the team already. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: “You just pass the ball to her and you just look and enjoy what is about to happen. She's very good, I think, in the small spaces – one, two touches and then she can be gone. She has very good shots, very hard and strong. That's also a very good quality. “She's a hard worker as well. Sometimes, she's so tired that she can't walk anymore. She runs a lot for the team. She's a very good team-mate.” The pair have been part of the first team at PSV for the past two years, with Brugts leaving Binnenmaas for the Dutch giants aged 16. It’s been in that time that she and Snellenberg have become closer friends. Beautiful assist by Esmee Brugts 🔥pic.twitter.com/MVHvJszPrk “That started when the pandemic hit. We were actually playing PlayStation a lot because we couldn't do anything else,” the 18-year-old explains, before admitting Brugts is better at FIFA, though she’ll often beat her on Fortnite. “We’re very good friends and we can be very annoying to each other. I think that shows how good friends we are. She always tries to make a joke as well. She's fun to be around.” It’s all moved very quickly for Brugts, who ranked at No.12 in the 2022 NXGN list, since the move to Eindhoven. She's become a fixture of the PSV side, won the Dutch Cup, scored in the Champions League and, in February, made her senior Netherlands debut. It was on just her third appearance for her country that she netted her first goal. When Brugts makes her Euros debut this summer – she was an unused sub in the 1-1 draw with Sweden last week – it will be only her seventh cap. For Netherlands head coach Mark Parsons to have included the young forward in his squad just five months after her first game says a lot about the impression she has made. “Every camp, it felt like we had an issue, so we were forced at times to look at people a bit quicker than we planned, but that gave opportunity and a lot of players have stepped up – Esmee being one of them,” Parsons said in June. “[She’s] a very smart, creative player. I think her scanning, awareness and game insight is probably the biggest strength. ""She can dribble, pass, shoot, cross, defend – with one-v-one defending, defend with one-v-one pressing – but it's the game insight and intelligence that I think we're going to be enjoying for a few years.” It’s not about waiting for that to come, either. Brugts is already making that impact now, at such a young age. Heinerman has noticed her improvements in her box-to-box movement and goal-scoring, as well as her leadership. Snellenberg, recovering from an ACL injury that she says Brugts is helping her get through, is excited to see her in action in England. “I’m trying to go to a match, but I don’t know if it’s possible [with pre-season],” she says as her conversation with GOAL comes to a close. “Maybe if they reach the final, then I will go for sure. I noticed that in our programme, July 31 is free,” she laughs. Whether success like that comes for Brugts with the Netherlands this summer or not, it’s already clear that she is bound to have huge moments with her country at some point in her career. “All the club, we are very proud of her,” Heinerman adds. “She is the face of FC Binnenmaas for the women.” For more on the world's best young ballers, follow NXGN on Instagram, Twitter and TikTok.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/esmee-brugts-dutch-teen-women-s-euros/blt3adc8eedffaa845b,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2284,Full list of UK football figures to have been knighted & received CBEs & OBEs,"Some of football's biggest names have been recognised by the British monarchy for their services to the game. Sir Alex Ferguson, Sir Bobby Charlton and Sir Kenny Dalglish spring to mind when considering football icons who have been knighted, but there are plenty more. There are also other honours bestowed upon individuals, such as CBEs, OBEs and MBEs, and many footballers have also been recognised with those, though they are of a lower rank than those of the aforementioned individuals. GOAL brings you everything you need to know about footballers who have been knighted. Knighthoods are honours awarded to individuals by the sovereign of the United Kingdom in recognition of achievements in or services to a particular field. Individuals are deemed to be 'knighted' when they are awarded a medal or badge which signifies that they have been given the title of Knight Grand Cross or Knight Commander (Dame Grand Cross or Dame Commander in the case of women) of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.  The Knight Grand Cross/Dame Grand Cross (GBE) is the highest honour of the chivalric order, followed by Knight Commander/Dame Commander (KBE/DBE). Those who have received these honours are free to take the title Sir or Dame. Below GBE and KBE, in order, are Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE), Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) and Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE). Honorary knighthoods are awarded to citizens of countries where the British sovereign - in this case, the Queen - is not the head of state. Football figures who have been knighted form a very exclusive group, with less than 20 individuals receiving the honour. The group includes former Manchester United managers Matt Busby and Alex Ferguson, as well as England's World Cup-winning manager Alf Ramsey. *Honorary knighthood  Interestingly, Brazil's three-time World Cup winner Pele was given an honorary knighthood in 1997, but he strictly cannot use the title Sir until he becomes a British citizen - at which point the honorary knighthood would then become a substantive knighthood. Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish is one of the most recent recipients, having received the honour in 2018. Like knighthoods, the number football figures to have received CBEs remains relatively small. Former Celtic manager Jock Stein was given the honour in 1970, three years after he helped the Glasgow club become the first British club to win the European Cup. Roy Hodgson 2021 Other figures to have received CBEs include ex England women's team manager Hope Powell and former Scotland manager Craig Brown, while former England and Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer was given a CBE in 2016. The list of football figures who have received OBEs is much bigger than those who have received knighthoods and CBEs. Among those who to have been rewarded with the honour are David Beckham, Brian Clough and Gary Lineker.  Luther Blissett 2022 Jermain Defoe 2018 Rio Ferdinand 2022 Mark Hughes 2004 Gareth Southgate 2019 Mike Summerbee 2022 *Honorary OBE.  Jack Charlton, who was part of England's 1966 World Cup-winning team, has been awarded an OBE, which is sure to have been a discussion topic with his brother Sir Bobby Charlton. Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, along with ex Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier and Chelsea legend Gianfranco Zola have been awarded honorary OBEs.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/full-list-uk-football-figures-knighted-obes-cbes/jtktzq1desbc193nvf74jkzgq,Goal,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2305,All of US: The U.S. Women's Soccer Show: NWSL 2022 season & UWCL final preview,"The NWSL season is well and truly under way, with the Challenge Cup trophy having been taken home by the North Carolina Courage last weekend, while the regular season has already seen plenty of exciting action. On this week's episode of All of US: The U.S. Women's Soccer Show, GOAL reflects on the first competition of the year while looking ahead to all that is coming, picking out the players, teams and stories to keep an eye on as 2022 unfolds. The biggest game of the season in Europe is also on the horizon, with Lyon to face Barcelona in the Women's Champions League final later this month. There is plenty to talk about on that front too, particularly with U.S. women's national team star Catarina Macario putting in award-worthy performances for the French giants. You can find All of US simply by searching for it on your preferred podcast platform, be that Spotify, Apple, or something else. As well as listening to this week's show, there is plenty of timeless content to go back and enjoy - with some making for particularly great listening ahead of all the women's soccer coming in May. On an NWSL front, Ashley Hatch from the Spirit, Emina Ekic of Racing Louisville and OL Reign defender Alana Cook have all joined us in recent weeks to talk about their careers to date and look ahead to the 2022 season. Macario was also a guest earlier this season, discussing her move to Lyon, her decision to play for the USWNT over Brazil and lots more. If you're looking for some content that covers the Barcelona side, you can also check out the episode with Veronica Boquete. She and her Spain team-mates did something in 2015 that was incredibly important for the rise of the women's game in her homeland, speaking out about alleged abuse from the national team's head coach. ""It's hard to imaigne the sweet moment that Spanish women's football is living now if we will still with Ignacio Quereda,"" she says in an incredibly open interview. After winning the Challenge Cup, the Courage are right up there as one of the favourites for the Championship. However, it is a very open race for that title. The Spirit, the reigning champions, are big contenders, as are OL Reign and the Portland Thorns, while the Chicago Red Stars have also shown their ability to get results even with key players absent in recent weeks. California's two expansion teams are making some noise too, with Alex Morgan scoring four goals last week for the San Diego Wave and Angel City beating the Courage. If they are not in play-off contention, they will at the very least be teams that can upset those who are. The UWCL final on May 21 will be a repeat of the showpiece event from 2019, one that was a catalyst for making Barcelona the incredible team they are today. They were beaten 4-1 that day as Lyon won their sixth European trophy, which they followed up with a seventh in 2020. However, last year, as the French side were knocked out for the first time in seven years, Barca reigned supreme. The Spanish champions have been the talk of the town ever since - something which has provoked comment from those in Lyon, who are keen to ensure their incredible achievements over the last 10 years are not forgotten. From a U.S. perspective, the French side will be the one most are rooting for, with USWNT stars Macario and Lindsey Horan aiming to win their first UWCL title, both having had stand-out moments on the road to Turin.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/all-of-us-us-womens-soccer-nwsl-2022-uwcl-final-preview/bltc61d29f087ab4af6,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2340,‘I want to be a more dangerous player ‘ – Denmark's NXGN star Kuhl making all her ‘dreams’ come true,"""A dream come true."" When GOAL sits down to talk with Kathrine Kuhl, the 18-year-old Denmark international who ranks at No.7 in the NXGN 2022 list of the world's best teenage footballers, it is a phrase that she utters several times - so much so that she half-chuckles at herself on the third mention. It is not a stock answer, though. It’s a genuine representation of how she has spent the first few years of what looks set to be a long, successful career, ticking off things that are on any footballer’s bucket list. Playing in the top division in her home country? Check. Winning a major trophy? Check. Making her international debut? Check. The latter was the craziest moment of her young career to date. Representing the national team was Kuhl’s biggest dream as a child. She watched Denmark on the television and just wanted to emulate the players wearing her country’s colours. Aged 17, she had been playing well for her club, Nordsjaelland, and made an impression in Denmark’s youth ranks too. But when national team head coach, Lars Sondergaard, decided to reward her with her first senior call-up last April, ""it was a total surprise."" “First, I didn't know his number, so I was thinking, 'Who is this? Who's calling me?'"" Kuhl laughs, recalling the moment to GOAL. ""I called him back and he was like, 'we want to get you to play and just have a try to play'. I was thinking, 'oh my god, is this happening?' I couldn't imagine that it was real, because it has just been my dream since I was little.” Kuhl ran up the stairs to find her mother as soon as the call finished, neither really able to comprehend what was going on. “It was such a weird situation, but she was just happy and I don't know if she knew what it was in the beginning, because it was all so weird,” she says, still chuckling with a hint of disbelief. “I just wanted to show that I can play at that level, and to see if I could play at that high level. It was actually quite easy to fit in the group because everyone is so sweet. Also, on the pitch, they're so helpful. I learned a lot in the first time I was with them. I was very grateful for that. “I took it all in it because you don't know when you will have that experience again. That was important for me, to just enjoy and learn a lot.” The origins of Kuhl’s rise lay in Hillerod, a small Danish town with a population of just over 30,000 people. It was there that Nordsjaelland’s talented midfielder was born and would play for several years. A serial goalscorer as a youngster, Kuhl enjoyed playing football from the age of five, but would have some doubts as to whether she wanted to take the sport more seriously as she became a teenager. “I feel like I stood between playing, not for fun, but not that seriously, and just playing very seriously,” she explains. Fortunately for Nordsjaelland and Denmark, she would stick with it – and she is certainly reaping the rewards. A move to the former came shortly after, where she would establish herself as a regular starter aged 16. The day before her 17th birthday, she lifted the Danish Women's Cup with the club – named Player of the Match in the final. “I was like, 'oh my god. I didn't even know that I played a good game!'” Kuhl remembers. “It was very special."" She is translating that talent to the international stage now, where she has made nine appearances for her country and scored her first international goal. It is a great environment for her to continue to develop, with the midfielders in the team having a particular impact on her. “I feel like I've learned a lot of the positioning, especially defensively,” she explains. That’s something you simply have to develop when you’ve got former GOAL50 winner Pernille Harder running at you. “Yeah,” Kuhl laughs. “It’s hard!"" “It's also a good opportunity to get to communicate more, because I've experienced that it's so important when we play national games, because it's such a high level.” With her experiences, talent and attitude combined, the sky is the limit. The latter shines through in her chat with GOAL, her grounded personality prominent, as well as her desire to improve to reach the top. “Personally, I want to be a more dangerous player. I'm not the player who scores the most goals,” Kuhl says. “I want to work on my finishing and my assist game also, to be a more important player. “But my future goal is, of course, to play abroad and play in a big European club. That's one of my big dreams.” Anywhere in particular? “As long as I can go to a good club, I'm happy. But, of course, the Spanish league. I really like how they play. They play very quick and with few touches, and they're very technical. But I've heard that the English league is growing and it's very good also, so that's also very interesting.” Kuhl's biggest experience yet could be in the immediate future, though. The European Championship finals are only a few months away, and she has become a regular in not only the squads for Denmark, but the starting line-ups. Five years ago, she watched on television as the players she now calls her team-mates finished as runners-up at the tournament. How would it feel if she was to be part of Sondergaard's final squad this time around? “It would be another dream come true,” she says. ‘Another’ being the key word.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/dangerous-player-denmark-nxgn-star-kuhl-dreams-come-true/blt69000f99666c2468,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2351,"Ratified Spotify sponsorship deal the best in Barcelona's history, claims president Laporta","Barcelona have ratified the club's sponsorship agreement with music service Spotify, with the streaming giant set to deliver a deal reportedly worth over €280 million (£236m/$309m). The move, which will see their stadium named the Spotify Camp Nou and shirt branding changed over the next few seasons, was agreed in principle last month. But it needed to be ratified by Barcelona stakeholders, which it now has been, to the delight of club president Joan Laporta, who said the move reinforced both the club's democratic control and vision for the future. “Days like today reinforce our uniqueness and club model,"" Laporta stated. ""It is a privilege that the delegates can vote and decide. It is a pride to have this club model. ""We have to maintain it and as long as I am president you will always be the owners of FC Barcelona. ""The agreement surpasses any agreement that Barca has had in its history."" In addition to delivering a shot of much-needed financial stability for the Blaugrana after several years of money woes, the Spotify deal will see the brand partnered across more than just Camp Nou. They will become Barca's main shirt sponsors from the 2022-23 season onwards, as well as sponsoring their training gear and the women's team too.

2395,'I'm going to the f*cking White House': USWNT legend Rapinoe to receive Presidential Medal of Freedom,"United States Women's National Team idol Megan Rapinoe will receive the prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom, becoming the first soccer player to be granted the honor.  Rapinoe, 36, has stood out not just on the pitch but off it too, where she has worked tirelessly as an activist for LGBT rights, racial equality and the campaign for equal pay.  Over the course of her career, the midfielder has enjoyed success at both team and individual level, winning two World Cups with the USWNT while also lifting the 2019 Ballon d'Or.  ""U.S. Women’s National Team forward Megan Rapinoe will receive the nation’s highest civilian honor when the President of the United States awards her the Presidential Medal of Freedom on July 7 at the White House,"" a press release from US Soccer confirmed on Friday. ""The award recognizes people who have made exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors.  ""Rapinoe is the first soccer player to receive the award and one of just six female athletes or coaches to be so honored along fellow 2022 recipient and Olympic gold medal gymnast Simone Biles, tennis player and women’s rights pioneer Billie Jean King, 1932 Summer Olympics track and field gold medalist and professional golfer Babe Didrikson Zaharias, women’s basketball legend Pat Summitt and professional golfer Annika Sorenstam.  ""Before this year, just 647 people have received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the past 59 years since the award was first given out in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy."" As the first football star to receive the medal, Rapinoe told reporters: ""I hope I’m doing right by everyone and making everyone proud. I hope everyone who’s ever played for this team or been into a camp or even got one call-up understands that this is for all of us, it’s not just for one player.”  She then ended the press conference by giving peace signs to the camera and shouting: “You guys, I’m going to the f*cking White House."" According to US Soccer's statement, the veteran star initially thought she was the victim of a practical joke.  ""The announcement was made earlier today, but Rapinoe was informed about a week ago while in training camp with the USWNT in Denver. Rapinoe was having lunch with her teammates between a weight-lifting session and a practice at the Denver Broncos Training Center when her phone rang.

Rapinoe added: “In that moment I spoke to the President, I was, and still am, totally overwhelmed. “I just think of all the people who I feel deserve a part of this medal, from my family to current and former teammates, all the women of the U.S. Women’s National Team throughout our history, to Colin Kaepernick, the three woman who founded Black Lives Matter – Opal, Alicia and Patrisse – to Marsha P, Sylvia and Billie Jean, the Williams sisters, of course my fiancé Sue Bird, and so many more.

2432,"Viking Clap: Football chant made famous by Iceland, video and how to do it","Football chants are as varied and unique as the teams that play the sport, with supporters delving deep into the creative well for ideas that will help to inspire players on the pitch. The Viking Clap is a classic example of a rousing, stadium-trembling chant. Having come to prominence at Euro 2016 in France and later at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, the chant has been adopted by the fans of many teams, such is its inspirational quality. So what exactly is it, which teams are associated and how is it done? GOAL brings you everything you need to know. The Viking Clap, or Viking Thunder Clap, is a chant which gained notoriety at the European Championship in 2016, when Iceland players and supporters combined to perform it in a show of cohesion after games. Fans of the island nation would perform the chant during games and it became a tradition for the players to then salute their loyal following, whether they won, lost or drew a game. The clap chant subsequently became synonymous with the Iceland team, with a massive crowd performing it as part of their 2016 homecoming event. You can see the Iceland women's team perform the Viking Clap with their supporters at Euro 2022 in the video below. Iceland with the Viking clap at full time with their fans 👏🏼 #ISL #WEURO2022 pic.twitter.com/BO9viEjNlr The Viking Clap is a chant which involves a slow build up of simultaneous claps and 'huh' sounds. Generally, one fan will prompt the crowd to clap and make noise in unison with two quick beats of a drum, with the gap between each prompt getting shorter each time, building to a crescendo of cheers and applause. While the Viking Clap is now synonymous with the Iceland national football teams, it has, in fact, been a feature of many football grounds across the world over the years. Fans of French team Lens have performed slow claps with shouts of ""Lens!"" (instead of 'huh!'), while supporters of Scottish team Motherwell have also famously performed a slow clap chant for decades. Since being beamed to a global audience at Euro 2016 thanks to Iceland, however, the chant has been adopted by more teams, with teams across Europe, North America and Asia doing it. Toronto and Seattle Sounders fans notably perform a similar chant in MLS, while Irish team St Patrick's Athletic frequently play to the sound of the clap.  Supporters of Rangers in Scotland, Kerala Blasters in India and Persepolis of Iran also deploy the chant.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/viking-clap-football-chant-iceland-how-to-do-it/blt0b1a3365c2270108,Ryan Kelly,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

2442,‘Everyone else should just go home’ - England's record-breaking Lionesses taking the Women’s Euros by storm,"""A massive failure"" – That’s what Kenny Shiels, the Northern Ireland manager, believes it would be if England didn’t win the Women’s Euros this summer. He was speaking after his team had just become the latest victim of this ruthless side, losing 5-0 to the Lionesses in their final group stage fixture. That resounding victory followed England’s record-breaking 8-0 rout of Norway just a few days prior, which was certainly a stark contrast to their first game – a gritty 1-0 win over Austria at a packed Old Trafford. With the incredible response the players have produced to that nervy opener, Euros fever is beginning to sweep the host nation.  Fans have started to belt out choruses of 'It’s coming home', millions at home are tuning in to watch this relentless attack and the performances have even started to enter conversations of casual small talk around the country. “They’re playing incredibly well, aren’t they?” said the man sat opposite GOAL on a train the day after the Norway win. “Do you think they could win it?” England were always a favourite going into this tournament. After all, they’ve not lost a game since head coach Sarina Wiegman, who won the 2017 edition in charge of the Netherlands, took over last August. But the displays on show in the last two weeks have been on another level. The importance of that Austria game in this form cannot be overstated. It was crucial overcoming the nerves and the impressive game plan of the opposition – who have also qualified for the knockouts. “There’s still a lot more we need to improve on and we’re going to take every game as it comes, but I think it shows our grit and determination to see out the result and get the win,"" winger Lauren Hemp said afterwards in a mixed zone that, despite the result, felt subdued.  After all the hype, this wasn’t an electric display. That’s been a solid foundation to build on, since. Leah Williamson, the England captain, described the 8-0 win over Norway as ""the type of football"" she'd ""want to watch"" if she was a fan. The Northern Ireland win was so good that Shiels said that every other team “should just go home”. This is an England team that appears to have hit some sort of ‘tournament-mode’, the type you associate with Germany and their mentality.  Building up to the Euros, there were valid questions about whether they could be clinical enough to win the title. Three games in, they look more ruthless than ever before. Part of that is down to the sheer talent within this squad. It’s a team littered with star quality, from the established names like Fran Kirby and Lucy Bronze, to the up-and-comers such as Alessia Russo and Ella Toone. There are then the elements that Wiegman has brought to the table.  As well as her experience and winning mentality, she’s created a relaxed atmosphere that contrasts the huge external pressure – one epitomised by the card games, darts and basketball challenges that take up the players’ time at the team hotel between training sessions and matches. When it comes to the football, she’s emphasised the need for “rhythm” in the team. That’s why, in what was a dead rubber against Northern Ireland, her starting XI was the same for a third game in a row. It appears to be working not just with the 11 players on the pitch when the first whistle goes, but with the substitutes that are full of hunger, too. That much was clear in their last outing, with the Manchester United duo of Russo and Toone particularly excellent – the former scoring twice and the latter assisting one of her goals. ""Every time they step on the pitch they give everything,"" Bronze said of the pair afterwards. ""They light a fire. You can see the connection they have.  ""It’s great to find that kind of excitement and energy off the bench. They're two great girls lapping up their first tournament."" Of course, now, things are going to be ramped up even more. The pressure is going to increase, the opponents get tougher and the risk of fatigue in that not-so-rotated XI can grow. On Wednesday, the Lionesses take on Spain, a team that hasn’t been at its best so far but one stacked with some of the best players on this planet, who can change a game at any moment.  Aitana Bonmati, the all-action Barcelona midfielder, is one of those. “It’s going to be very motivating for us to play against England in their home with the crowd,” she said after Spain beat Denmark to set-up this tie. “We were born to play this game. “I’m not scared. I don’t think my team-mates are scared either. We know that they are a good team, they are [putting on] many good performances.  ""But we think we can beat them, [though] we have to improve our style and be better than today.” Austria have shown how a team can get at England. Spain will note that in the build-up to their clash, as will any other possible opponents of the hosts if they are to progress. But what they have done since has certainly captured the attention of the nation - and the tournament.  “I’d rather peak at the final than in the first game,” Kirby said after the opener against Austria. The way England are playing, it’ll take something special to stop them getting there.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-record-breaking-lionesses-women-s-euros/blt203df732df23f9b5,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2458,USWNT star Heath returns to NWSL with OL Reign on season-long deal,"OL Reign have confirmed the acquisition of USWNT forward Tobin Heath from Racing Louisville, with the ex-Portland Thorns star linking up with the NWSL outfit on a deal through the end of the season, with an option to extend in 2023. The 34-year-old returns to the Pacific Northwest where she enjoyed her greatest domestic success during a seven-season spell in Oregon. Heath most recently spent stints in the Women's Super League with Manchester United and Arsenal, and heads back to her home country with an eye on next year's Australia/New Zealand 2023 World Cup. ""This is a very special time for our club as we add another excellent player to our squad,"" Reign head coach Laura Harvey told the club's official website. ""Tobin has an incredible mindset and a rich history in the NWSL, and has a proven ability to change the game. ""Tobin’s ability to create and finish chances adds something unique, that I believe will help elevate our group. Tobin’s experience playing in the league will be a valuable asset for our group."" Heath was similarly delighted, adding: ""[I] couldn’t be more thrilled to play alongside the world class players here, for Laura Harvey as my coach, and in front of the amazing community of supporters. We’re all eager to win a title, and I’m hopeful I can help OL Reign achieve that goal."" The veteran joins a Reign team seeking to push on from last season's second-place finish and prove themselves silverware competitors - but also gives her a chance to ensure her spot in the national team's next big title defence. The USWNT head down under next year looking to defend the crown they won in 2015 and 2019, with Heath a member of the squad that claimed victory on both occasions. The forward is likely to be very much on the mind of Vlatko Andonovski - but it may well be that she has to prove her fitness and form ahead of the tournament.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uswnt-star-heath-returns-to-nwsl-with-ol-reign-on-season/bltac2942a3713f5674,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

The former goalkeeper has been charged with driving while impaired, resisting a public officer and misdemeanour child abuse. On Saturday, Solo reached out to thank those who had shown her support following the incident. ""For those who have reached out with support and love, thank you,"" she affirmed in a statement shared on Twitter.  pic.twitter.com/MpK8RGazLd ""Our family is strong and surrounded by love.

2525,‘We are in an interesting space’ – UEFA explains choice of Women’s Euro 2022 venues amid criticism,"UEFA has explained the process of choosing venues for this summer’s Euros, following criticism of some of the stadia. Iceland midfielder Sara Bjork Gunarsdottir was one of the most vocal pre-tournament, describing it as “embarrassing” and “disrespectful” that her team will play their first two group games at Manchester City’s Academy stadium, which has a limited capacity of 4,700. The Nordic nation’s first fixture there was subject to a stunt by one betting company asking why games could not be played at Etihad Stadium over the road. However, UEFA believes the process it has for selecting the grounds for the tournament is “as close to” perfect as it could have been at the time they were chosen. Speaking on the Footballco Business Podcast just before the tournament began, Kayleigh Grieve, who works in women's football marketing and sponsorship at UEFA, explained the reasoning behind the stadia. “Those associations that are bidding to host the tournament will make the proposals to us of which stadiums [will be used], based on a criteria we have in our bidding structure of who comes forward,” she said. “So it’s not UEFA that goes in and solicits the stadiums we want, but we look at that together. “We are in an interesting space. Clearly, the bidding for this tournament happened a number of years ago and the women's game has been evolving rapidly from there. ""So where do you put the pin in terms of what stadiums that you use is a very challenging thing for any federation taking this on now.  “From the [Football Association’s] perspective, this was their role to do this but from the process we went through with them, it was clear that it would be better to have a full, slightly smaller stadium or a medium sized stadium than having really low numbers in huge stadiums. The atmosphere just is very different.” Grieve notes the “appetite for games growing”, mentioning the sell-out crowds at Camp Nou in particular, but admits “that's not the norm now, so we can't pretend to ourselves that that's going to be the norm and every game will be sold out”. She also discussed the lack of “huge travelling fans” in women’s football as another factor. “We know we have to generate the majority still of ticket sales from the local communities in the stadiums that we will go forward with for the tournament,” Grieve added. “We have to get those stadiums and, more so, the cities to be invested and want this to come to their city. They need to be willing to invest in that experience for fans and in the marketing behind the games as well. “These are all the factors that we're considering. Is it perfect? We don't know, but I think it's as close to it as we could possibly put a finger on at that moment in time when we had to make these decisions to get an idea of how we do create atmosphere at these games.” Wembley is the headline stadium for the tournament, the 90,000-seater venue hosting the final on July 31. Manchester United’s Old Trafford held the opening game between England and Austria, which welcomed a record-breaking attendance. The rest of the stadiums then all hold below 33,000 fans, ranging from Sheffield United's Bramall Lane down to the Manchester City Academy stadium. “What you can see in the strategy for this edition of the Women's Euro is certainly the showcase games, the opening and the closing, [we] went big and we’ve been proven right on that one because the ticket sales are all sold out there,” Grieve said. “The England games clearly are in the slightly bigger stadiums in the group stages, at least, and have sold out along that route as well. Then we have some varying degrees of stadiums beyond that. There’s a variety in there.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uefa-womens-euro-2022-venues-criticism-stadium-size/blt1c2c648ec645a8d0,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Madrid were 27 points behind Barca when they arrived at the Estadi Johan Cruyff on Sunday, and the gulf between the two teams was evident right from the off. The hosts went in at half-time with a 2-0 lead thanks to an Alexia Putellas brace, and second-half goals from Patricia Guijlarro, Babett Peter and Jennifer Hermoso ensured that they clinched the 2021-22 Primera Division crown in style. Barca have now won the domestic title in Spain three years in succession, and have won all 24 of their games in the current season. Jonatan Giraldez's side are 22 points clear of second-placed Real Sociedad with a staggering plus 130 goal difference, and the squad also dominates the goals and assists charts.

2585,Barcelona Femeni lose to Wolfsburg in Women's Champions League as 45-match win streak snapped,"Barcelona Femeni saw their 45-match win streak snapped on Saturday by Wolfsburg in the Women's Champions League semi-final second leg, as the German side emerged with a 2-0 victory. Despite going down on the day, Barcelona still advanced to the final with a 5-3 aggregate win. They will meet the winner of Paris Saint-Germain vs Lyon for the chance to be crowned champions of Europe in Turin at the Allianz Stadium. Barcelona Femeni's win streak has fuelled record-breaking interest in the team, with a recent quarter-final clash against Real Madrid drawing a historic crowd of 91,553 to Camp Nou. They boast a cast of world class talent, including 2021 Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas, which has been more than enough to accelerate the growth of the women's game in Spain. Xavi, the head coach of the men's team, has called them an inspiration. ""For several years [the women's team] have been showing us the way with how they play, how they compete and the hunger they have despite winning everything last year,"" the Spanish head coach told reporters. ""We have been watching them and it's a wonder to see them play. They are leading the way in the same way as the Dream Team did in their day or as Pep [Guardiola's] Barca side did later. They are an example for the men's team."" This was their first defeat since June 1, 2021, when they fell 4-3 to Atletico Madrid.

The NWSL expanded this season, with Angel City and San Diego Wave joining the competition. A further pair of clubs will enter the division in two years' time, taking it up to 14 teams. “This week’s meetings have underscored what I have believed from my first day on the job; the NWSL will be the tip of the spear in driving transformational change in the professional sports landscape in this country,” said commissioner Jessica Berman after the league's board of governors met across July 12 and 13 in New York. “I’ve spent the first three months of my tenure with the league on a listening tour speaking with hundreds of stakeholders, from owners to partners to players to fans. ""The overwhelming theme was that while we have challenges to address, we have infinite opportunities to unlock our potential that will serve our players and the millions who support them around the world. ""We are aligned around sustained investments to serve our league, a bold strategy to continue our growth, and a commitment to deliver the greatest product in professional soccer.” It is hoped that VAR will be introduced in time for the 2023 season, along with extra investment in officials.

2604,Barcelona confirm Women's Champions League clash with Wolfsburg is another sell-out,"Barcelona have confirmed that all available tickets for their Women’s Champions League semi-final tie against Wolfsburg later this month have sold out in 24 hours. The Catalan giants revealed 50,000 seats made available to members sold out on Monday before those put on general sale were snapped up by Tuesday afternoon. Barcelona’s quarter-final second leg victory over Real Madrid last month set a new record for the highest attendance in women's football, with 91,553 supporters in attendance at Camp Nou. In a statement on the club’s website, Barca said: “Barca Femeni will play again at the Camp Nou on April 22 in the first leg of the Women's Champions League against Wolfsburg and will once again have the unconditional support of the Barca people, who have responded en masse to the announcement that they will return to there will be a big party at the Stadium to accompany Jonatan Giraldez's team on their way to the final in Turin on May 21. “In just over 24 hours, tickets that have been made available to members and the general public have been sold out due to the avalanche of demand for this party.” Barcelona confirmed that there are some tickets still reserved by UEFA that may be released for general sale in the days before the game. After hosting the two-time Champions League winners in the first leg, Barca then travel to Germany for the return meeting on April 30. PSG face Lyon in the other semi-final, with the final scheduled for May 21 at the Juventus Stadium in Turin. Last month’s Clasico tie at the Camp Nou broke the previous attendance record for a women’s football match set at the World Cup in 1999 when the United States faced China at the Rose Bowl.

2698,When are the UEFA Champions League finals in 2023? Men’s & women’s season explained,"Another football season is upon us, and with it begins the long battle for the Champions League title among Europe's elite clubs in both the men's and women's games. Real Madrid enhanced their status as the most successful club in the competition's history last season when they beat Liverpool in the final to win the title for the 14th time. Meanwhile, Lyon overcame Barcelona to win the Women's Champions League final for the eighth time in their history. With the record winners of both competitions coming out on top once again, it was business as usual in the Champions Leagues in 2021-22. This term, however, will be somewhat unique as the season is going to be disrupted when the World Cup kicks off in Qatar in November. Ahead of the launch of Heineken's Fresher Football campaign, GOAL takes a look at how the winter World Cup will affect the Champions League finals. Last season's Champions League final between Real Madrid and Liverpool kicked off on May 28, while the previous year, when Chelsea overcame Manchester City in the decider, the match was played on May 29. This year, there is a bit of a delay until the biggest showdown in the club football season kicks off, with the game going ahead on June 10. This season’s top two European teams will go head-to-head at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul. It will be the second time the final will be played in the stadium, having previously played host to the iconic final between AC Milan and Liverpool in 2005. Fans will be hoping for another mesmerising final like that of the ‘Miracle of Istanbul’, when Liverpool came from 3-0 down at half-time to earn a 3-3 draw before going on to win the title on penalties. The stadium was supposed to be the venue for the 2020 final between Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain, but due to the Covid-19 pandemic the match was moved to Lisbon. A similar thing happened the following year, with the match being played in Portugal again instead of the stadium in Istanbul. The stadium, which was built between 1999-2002 for Turkey’s unsuccessful bid to host the 2008 Olympics, has a capacity of over 75,000. The UEFA Women’s Champions League final is usually played in the middle of May. This year, however, it will not go ahead until either June 3 or June 4. The headline clash between the finalists will take place in Eindhoven at the Philips Stadion. The stadium has a capacity of around 36,500. The last time a major European club competition final was played there was in 2006, when Sevilla ran out 4-0 winners against Middlesbrough in the UEFA Cup final. When are the UEFA Men's Champions League group stage and knockout rounds? After the qualifying rounds are completed, the draw for the group stage of the Champions League will take place on August 25. The first round of matches will begin on September 6, with the sixth and final week of the group stage going ahead on November 1. The knockout stages will then commence in 2023 after the World Cup and winter break. The first games will take place on February 14 and 15 and the round will be concluded on the week of March 14-15. The quarter-finals will then take place in April, followed by the semi-finals in May to decide who goes on to the June final in Turkey. When are the UEFA Women's Champions League group stage and knockout rounds? The Women’s Champions League campaign will not be so heavily disrupted by the World Cup, so some group stage matches will be played while the competition in Qatar is going on. The group stage will kick off on October 19 and finish on December 22. The tournament will then enter the quarter-finals on March 21 and finish on March 30, followed by the semi finals taking place on April 22 and 23 before the second legs on April 29 and 30.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/when-are-uefa-champions-league-finals-2023-mens-womens/bltbefdd57184ce10d1,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2716,Champions around the world: How the City Football Group came to dominate the global game,"""The empire on which the sun never sets,"" is a statement originally attributed to Charles I of Spain to describe his country’s reach around the globe in the 16th century. But it is a claim that could now be made by another Spaniard, Ferran Soriano - the Barcelona-born CEO of the City Football Group. Sorriano currently sits in charge of 10 clubs as part of the powerful CFG stable, where from New York City FC to Melbourne City, via Mumbai City and the jewel in the crown, Manchester City, the sun is shining on a national champion. There are other examples of multi-club ownership, such as the Red Bull Group, but none are close to being as successful as the CFG. Take this week, when Manchester City are expected to overcome Portuguese champions Sporting C.P. after a 5-0 first leg victory, to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League. That game will kick-off less than 24 hours after NYCFC's last-eight first-leg victory over Guatemala's Comunicaciones in the CONCACAF equivalent. Mumbai and Melbourne, meanwhile, will kick-off their continental challenges in the Asian Football Confederation's edition of the Champions League in April. Japanese giants Yokohama F. Marinos - who finished second in J1 League last season - and Chinese side Sichuan Jiuniu represent the CFG's other Asian interests.  It is now eight years since the business first moved beyond the city of Manchester, when the CFG bought a Major League Soccer expansion franchise, although Soriano had been considering the possibility of a stable of clubs since his time in a similar role at Barcelona. He had looked at the franchise model of Disney and how customers had a level of expectation whenever they experienced a movie, store or theme park. The idea could be transplanted to the world of football, where fans could visit a sister club on any continent and be assured a high level of entertainment. Arriving at City in 2012, that vision has now become a reality with the help of the vast wealth of City owner Sheikh Mansour, as well as significant minority shareholdings held by global equity firms Silver Lake and China Media Capital. Europe remains the focus, but having a foothold across the world gives the group the advantage of being able to manoeuvre should the footballing landscape change. Interest in the sport is rising massively in Asia, and Soriano also sees North America as a growing market. ""For us, City Football Group, the US is the bigger market than UK,"" he told ESPN last month. ""There are more Americans watching soccer than in the UK. Of course, there are more choices, but the market is huge."" As well as having a presence in various markets, the benefits are big too from a footballing perspective. The obvious example would be from a playing viewpoint, with the potential to gather the best players at a priority club. In reality, that has not come to fruition, with movement of playing staff more centred around the development of young players, with prospects moving to Troyes, Girona and Lommel - the smaller sister clubs in Europe. That has helped those teams to grow and progress, while offering players such as Douglas Luiz, Angelino and Yangel Herrera valuable game time, with the first two having now been sold on for a healthy profit. But there is also a big benefit to move off-field staff around the group to offer their expertise from a commercial or business angle, and there are also opportunities for coaches. Among those to have moved around the CFG are Patrick Vieira and Domenec Torrent, who joined NYCFC from Manchester, and Mumbai City boss Des Buckingham, who worked previously as an assistant at Melbourne City. ""For me and my family to live in New York is an amazing journey and it's been a lot easier to transition because I work for the same organisation,"" NYCFC assistant Nick Cushing, who was previously in charge of Manchester City Women, tells GOAL. Walk into the Etihad City Football Academy in Orangeburg in Rockland County and you could just as easily be at the Etihad Campus in east Manchester. Everything from the locker room to the signage is universal. It is the same from Montevideo City Torque to Melbourne. Similar too, is the ideology in how clubs approach their footballing philosophy, from recruitment to ambition. Playing styles vary depending on the coaches and squads involved. In Manchester, Pep Guardiola's influence has cascaded down into all teams that train at the City Football Academy, and it is understandable that others would want to tap into that knowledge, even if it's not as simple as copy and pasting his strategy. Don't miss the highlights of the first leg quarterfinal #SCCL22 match here! 👇@NYCFC 🗽 🆚 🔵 @CremasOficial pic.twitter.com/2mtHcI5AFG ""We share the same values, we work the same way, the alignment that we have through our football clubs across the group means that it was almost a seamless transition coming from Manchester into New York,"" Cushing adds. ""We share the same methodology around how we work, playing style, the way we prepare the team, we share that across the group. ""But if we need to get some experience or get another point of view, we can connect with Manchester, we can connect with Melbourne, we can share those ideas. ""I don't think it's a coincidence that this year Manchester, Melbourne, Mumbai, New York all won their championships, because from a coaching perspective, we connect regularly on different parts of the game, different phases of the game, different experiences around play in opposition styles, and that really helps."" It is not unthinkable that future Club World Cups could feature several sides from within the CFG. Manchester City got close when they reached last season's Champions League final but were beaten by Chelsea. Guardiola's side are among the favourites again this time around, and should reach the last eight for a fifth straight year unless they suffer a catastrophe in their second leg with Sporting. New York, meanwhile, have a 3-1 advantage ahead of their trip to Guatemala and a chance of reaching the semi-finals in North America. Across eight time zones and five football federations, the empire is growing more dominant. The sun never sets on the City Football Group.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/champions-world-city-football-group-dominate-global-game/bltbe5b92b8260a5a2e,Jonathan Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2718,Inside Saudi Media's Chelsea takeover bid: Renew Rudiger's contract and rebuild Stamford Bridge,"Saudi Media's bid to buy Chelsea includes plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge and renew the contracts of key players such as Antonio Rudiger and Cesar Azpilicueta. The group isn't just concerned with ensuring that the men's senior squad continue to compete for the biggest trophies either. Saudi Media also intends to continue investing heavily in the London club's academy at Cobham Training Centre, as well as the women's team. The man spearheading the bid is Mohamed Alkhereiji, who runs Saudi Media and is the CEO of the parent company Engineer Holding Group, which was founded by his father Abdulelah AlKhereiji. Alkhereiji has spent time living in the United Kingdom, where he attended Cass Business School and spent three years working at Deutsche Bank. He was at Chelsea's 3-1 win over Arsenal in 2017, the game in which Eden Hazard famously dribbled half the length of the pitch before scoring. Coincidentally, he was also present the last time Abramovich made an appearance at Stamford Bridge, for the 1-1 draw with Manchester United in November.  Alkhereiji and his children are Chelsea fans, which is why he is so keen to acquire the club. However, he primarily supports Saudi Arabian outfit Al Nassr, for whom he built a new, state-of-the-art stadium in Mrsool Park. As well as being involved in Al Nassr, Saudi Media also works with Al Hilal, whom Chelsea faced at the Club World Cup last month. Saudi Media is the biggest media group in the Middle East, and also has interests in advertising, hospitality, the banking sector and sports. The company turns over $1 billion (£770 million) a year, giving it scope to be a powerful player in English football. It is worth noting, though, that Saudi Media's takeover bid will be co-funded by a consortium of various other private backers from Saudi Arabia. Chelsea have discouraged ""politically sensitive"" parties from bidding for the club but Saudi Media does not believe it falls into that category. Unlike Newcastle United – who are now owned by the Saudi Arabian state via the Public Investment Fund – Manchester City or Paris Saint-Germain, Saudi Media is an entirely private entity with no direct ties to a particular ruler or government. تتوقعون نشوف الملعب فلّ😍خلونا نوصلها للـ 100% الليلة 🔥💪🏻همتكم يا عالميين 💛💙https://t.co/N7wjy6QWVt#النصر_الهلال#مرسول_بارك pic.twitter.com/g1LWdELyWh Saudi Arabia's record on women's rights, in particular, is a concern to many civil rights groups but SMC employs a large number of women, while the country has made reforms that have resulted in the female share of the workforce increasing to 33.2 per cent. As it stands, the Premier League would have little reason to block any sale of Chelsea to Saudi Media, having accepted far more controversial takeovers in the past. They are ready to tackle the major challenge of rebuilding Stamford Bridge, which could cost upwards of £1.5bn ($2bn). Their previous experience building football stadiums and infrastructure is being touted as a key advantage of their bid, with their existing connections in marketing and advertising also considered a major asset in terms of helping to cover the costs involved in such an ambitious redevelopment project. Indeed, it is believed that they can attract the most lucrative sponsors to the club, and this is significant because Chelsea have long had trouble matching the commercial draw of Premier League rivals Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool. Roman Abramovich has been disqualified as a director of Chelsea by the Premier League. Chelsea have already seen their principal shirt sponsor, telecoms company Three, suspend their deal with the club, but Saudi Media are confident that they can secure a bigger and better agreement for the Blues. The group also believes its ownership, and extensive media outlets, would prove extremely beneficial in terms of broadening the club's fanbase, given 70 percent of the Middle East population is under 30. Saudi Media essentially feels it would afford Chelsea far greater access to an untapped market. Should their bid prove successful, they would also set up academies in the region and use the women's team to change perceptions of how the sport is perceived. The UK Government has opened the bidding process, with New York investment bank Raine Group having been employed by Roman Abramovich to sell the club.  The deadline for a sale has been extended to 18 March, after delays caused by the sanctions imposed upon Abramovich, including the freezing of his assets.  English billionaire Nick Candy, and a group headed by Hansjorg Wyss and Todd Boehly, are among those interested in acquiring Chelsea. ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/saudi-media-chelsea-takeover-bid-keep-rudiger-rebuild/blt3867c8c4c58996a9,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

2734,USWNT forward Trinity Rodman apologizes for 'completely wrong' player pay statement,"United States women's national team and Washington Spirit forward Trinity Rodman has apologised for a recent statement on player pay she admits was ""completely wrong"" and not in line with her intent. Rodman, who recently received the largest contract in NWSL history at just 20 years old, was criticized for a quote some felt mischaracterized her role in helping women attain better wages in the sport. But the rising star has clarified that she holds full respect for the trail blazers who came before her and didn't mean to suggest she was ""ungrateful or stuck up"". “I’m that person that broke the mold for that (receiving big contracts),"" she told ESPN.  ""I’m paving the path for younger players and showing older players that this is what they should have gotten in the first place.” ""This quote has been completely misunderstood and I'm sorry about that,"" she wrote on social media. ""In this quote I worded it completely wrong, I just turned 20, so my wording is not perfect in every interview. “I never want to be perceived as ungrateful or stuck-up, that’s not who I am. I want everyone to know that I never have thought once that I am the reason that pay has gone up. “I strongly acknowledge what ‘older players’ or veterans have done to earn what they’ve gotten, they’ve put blood, sweat and tears into paving the path for me and I feel so blessed, my goal right now is to pave the way for people younger than me and learn from those who did it before me.” Rodman's contract extension through 2024 is worth a reported $1.1 million, which is a record for NWSL players and represents a landmark deal for the women's game. She entered the professional ranks as one of the most-hyped young U.S. players ever, and so far, she's proven her backers correct with her on-field play. While she may not have set in motion the equal rights gears that led to her receiving a massive deal by NWSL standards, she still has the chance to make an important impact on her sport.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uswnt-forward-trinity-rodman-apologizes-for-completely-wrong/blt57cdd064df0d08c5,Dan Bernstein,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2739,"Football's most important team: Five years of Common Goal, featuring Mata, Klopp and the quest for 'radical' social change","What started as an idea has, in the space of five years, become a movement. You might have heard of Common Goal already, but one thing is for sure: you’ll be hearing a lot more about it in the future. “It’s been quite the journey,” smiles Thomas Preiss, co-founder of the pledge-based charitable organisation, which this week celebrates its fifth birthday. “It’s been a steady growth. We haven’t had a situation where the whole football world joined right away, but we have worked ourselves into becoming part of the cultural fabric.” Common Goal’s aim is to use football to drive change across eight ‘Global Goals’, which include, but are not limited to, issues such as anti-racism, climate action, gender equality, and LGBTQ+ rights. It seeks to unite players, coaches, clubs, organisations, agencies, media outlets, brands and ordinary supporters by asking them to pledge a minimum of one percent of their salaries and revenues, which is then used to create a ‘global community’ of high-impact organisations. Juan Mata, the former Chelsea, Manchester United and Spain midfielder, was the movement’s figurehead for its 2017 launch, but since then Common Goal has recruited more than 250 players, men and women, including the likes of Serge Gnabry, Pernille Harder, Giorgio Chiellini, Vivianne Miedema, Paulo Dybala, Alex Morgan, Timo Werner and Megan Rapinoe. Coaches such as Jurgen Klopp and Julian Nagelsmann have also taken the pledge, while Common Goal recently signed a deal with Werder Bremen, in which the Bundesliga club will invest one percent of all ticketing and sponsorship revenue, as well as offering an opt-in clause for all players, coaching staff and non-playing staff members to pledge one percent. FC Nordsjaelland, of Denmark, and the US second division side Oakland Roots are already on board with similar deals, and further expansion is expected. The aim, Preiss, says, is to soon have clubs in each of the major leagues on board. “We are moving from individuals to increasing our engagement and collaboration with institutions,” says Preiss, who anticipates “big steps” to be taken in the coming months and years. “After five years it becomes evident that our journey does not stop with the players and managers. They will always be leaders in this, but we are moving into the next phase with clubs and organisations. “For Common Goal to really have a radical impact on the industry, it needs to be a collaborative effort. That is what is needed to tackle the social challenges of our time. It can only happen together.” And so to commemorate five years of Common Goal, GOAL has spoken to a number of its members, who told us what it’s like to be part of football’s biggest and most important team… “When it comes to the fight against racism, it is important not only to talk, but also to take action. And in a group, more things can be achieved than they can working alone. That’s why I joined Common Goal. “To me, the most important thing is to educate and have empathy. If you have not felt racism in your own flesh, it is difficult to understand the repercussions it has on people. Each racist action has its consequences and you don't know what can happen to that person. It is very important to explain that and that they understand it. From there, they decide what to do with that information. ""Through Common Goal, I have done many interviews to raise awareness. We are talking about organising conferences with boys and girls about racism and trying to be part of these activities to make people see what is happening. ""I think that, little by little, progress is being made. When you talk, for example, with my father's generation, you realise that things are improving. It is a marathon, but little by little it will improve and for that you have to continue taking actions and educating people. There are places where there are still prejudices due to skin colour, and it is important that people complain. ""The aim is that everyone is accepted for who they are. That is our fight. Everyone is free to support what they want, but it is important that they are with us in this fight. ""It is important both to receive and give, and the one who receives has to help. As footballers we are in a position to help and there are people we can lend a hand to, because if we were in their situation we would like to receive help too. “It is important to me that with the blessing I have had of being able to dedicate myself to professional football, I can give something back to people who have suffered the same as me. Common Goal enables me to do that as part of a wider organisation.” “I’ve been a member of Common Goal since March, but before that I have been involved with charitable organisations and donations for a long time. “The thing was, it wasn’t always easy for me to see where the money goes, or what kind of organisation you are dealing with. Common Goal, though, are absolute experts in their field. They have an outstanding network, very good organisation and they are very flexible, also in co-operation. I think that the process is simply one of the most professional in the field of soccer in general. It can't be beaten in terms of personality. “Unfortunately, the war in Ukraine started in March, when I joined Common Goal. That's why we decided that my first donation, my first one percent, will go directly into this area. “This was an emergency organisation in the sense of humanitarian aid, which we directly set up. But it was also a good moment to support directly and to make a direct contributions, at least financially, in order to provide humanitarian aid on the ground, such as basic supplies, medical care and so on, to the people there and in the neighbouring countries. “Before that, we thought about how we would handle my donations. Since my roots are in Hungary, I also picked out a [Hungarian] organisation that I had at least exchanged with via Facetime and had actually made a few appointments during the international break, but this process was interrupted by the war.  “For me, everyone can make a contribution in their own way to make the world a little better, and I believe that sport and soccer are a good tool and also a huge stage because of the attention. Soccer connects, no matter where you are on the planet. Everyone has a connection to soccer somewhere. It attracts the masses and that's why I believe that you also have a chance to help people who are not doing so well, to support organisations like Common Goal and the work we are doing.” “It was in 2020, during lockdown, that I got involved. It came about through some team-mates of mine at Manchester City, Pauline Bremer and Janine Beckie, who told me about the work they did. “I like what the organisation stands for, and how it allows you to direct your focus into specific areas. Mine is gender equality and female empowerment. It’s about giving girls the opportunity to play football, play sport, and giving them the confidence to continue and show that there are opportunities out there.  “That’s important in the UK, but especially so in other areas of the world where maybe people are more deprived and have fewer opportunities. To empower women there and make them feel valued and that they have loads to offer, that’s really important for me. “I feel there has been progress in terms of gender equality in football. Even in the last five years the conversation has moved on. There is a very common theme among players of my generation, that they were the only girl on the football team growing up. That’s not necessarily the case now, because the world has moved on. “I was lucky, I came from a very supportive family, and I said I wanted to be a footballer from a very young age. They supported me, but not everyone has that kind of network around them, and that’s what Common Goal does, it gives that network and that support, so that girls can have those opportunities and feel safe.  “There are still issues. The game has come a long way, but it started from way, way down, so it could only go up! But the conversation is changing, definitely. Slowly, yes, and it will take time to change perceptions. That can take a couple of generations. “The boys and girls growing up now, it’s normal to see England or Scotland on the TV, or WSL games or the Women's Champions League. “It’ll take time, but it’s going in the right direction. The key now is more investment and continued investment, spreading the word and keeping the momentum going for years to come.” “It was my cousin who told me about the movement, and I realised that it was a good idea to join. I really like the one percent pledge idea. For me, it’s like some kind of tax, and a good tax system is one of the most important things in creating a good society.  “I’ve been involved in charity work for many years. From childhood, I’ve been interested in the world, and I was lucky that my parents brought me away from Denmark at an early age. I saw how people lived in other parts of the world, and it always touched me to see how lucky we are in Denmark, and most parts of Europe actually. “I have really felt how unfair the world is, and so I’ve always been interested to see how I can contribute to help do things better. “My big focus with Common Goal is with Climate Action. It’s the biggest crisis we have ever had, and that’s why I’m very involved in making a difference. “Climate change affects everything, it affects poverty around the world, and the fact that it’s created by us in the rich world, yet it affects those in the most vulnerable communities the most, is so unfair and really touches something in me. It makes me very angry and sad. “Awareness is growing, but I also think some clubs are a bit afraid of going into this debate for fear of being accused of hypocrisy. You can point your finger at clubs and players and organisations, because they fly to games and because they pay big money etc.  “But this is the only way to get into the discussion, and to try to reduce the football industry’s carbon emissions. It’s to our benefit, because climate change is also a threat to football. “The football industry has to contribute to try to fix the crisis, first by reducing its footprint, but also by using all the money to make a change. And we have 3.5 billion fans all over the world, so we have the platform to engage people. “Footballers have so many followers and fans, so when they speak out on an issue, it can help change things. And the power of Common Goal is that it doesn’t put the focus on the individual, it creates a collaboration which is where real transformation can happen. Feeling part of something bigger, a movement, is really big. The more people you have, the more you can change. “My hope is that the football industry will become net zero very soon.” “I met with Common Goal before I came out as gay [in 2018]. I was looking for places to engage in all these topics; advocacy at youth level, educating coaches, creating more inclusive environments. I was talking, but I didn’t know where to give my money and my energy. “Common Goal’s ‘Play Proud’ initiative made a lot of sense to me, and is something I’ve been involved in now for a year or two.  “What is special about Play Proud is how it connects all areas of the game, from the ground up. I get asked a lot ‘why are there so few gay players in the professional game?’, and it all comes back to players not feeling comfortable at youth level. “That’s based on a lot of things; the language used in dressing rooms, coaches perhaps not being as supportive as they need to be, lots of things. That’s where there needs to be more education, and for me that is why we don’t see more gay male athletes in professional sport. They just don’t feel like it’s a safe place for them to continue doing what they enjoy doing. “It’s about education. Since I came out, it’s been a lot easier for my team-mates to change their habits. They have my visibility, so it opens their mind a bit more. “But the sad thing, is that other dressing rooms don’t have that, because they haven’t had a gay team-mate, or if they have, they don’t know about it.  “I’ve seen both sides of it, both before and after I came out. I’ve felt uncomfortable in locker rooms with certain things that have been said, and then I’ve seen and felt the change. People might be walking on eggshells at times, but at least they are thinking about it and modifying their language or their behaviour. Those are positive steps. They are being educated whether they want it or not. “It’s been slow, but examples like Josh Cavallo and Jake Daniels, both of whom have come out in the last year, are big deals. We need more people having the courage to come out, to give that visibility and ensure that one day, we won’t have to have these ‘coming out’ stories. “Progress hasn’t been as big since I came out as maybe I expected, but we have to keep building in the right direction, so that 5-10 years down the road, it really won’t be a big deal to have a gay athlete on the team. “I think the work that Common Goal and Play Proud do is special. It’s about educating coaches and clubs in how to be more inclusive, and not just for players either. It’s for everyone who works at a club. If you have a trans videographer, how do you make them feel comfortable every day? The kitman might be gay, will he be well-supported within the club? It’s about the whole game, at all levels. “Then it’s about spreading the message. In the U.S. and the UK, I feel like we are on the right path, but how do we speak out into places that maybe aren’t as far along the line, in terms of the conversations around these issues? Those are the big challenges and focus areas.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/football-most-important-team-five-years-common-goal-radical/bltf1ca54d8f42c5b45,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2744,WSL has thrilling conclusion but must not follow Premier League’s shortcomings,"On Sunday, the Women’s Super League’s first season in front of the Sky Sports cameras came to a thrilling conclusion – one fitting of the record-breaking TV deal it secured last year. Both Chelsea and Arsenal were in contention to win the title as they entered their final fixtures, with Manchester City and Manchester United also both competing for that last Women’s Champions League spot. There were plenty of twists and turns on the day before the Blues made it three league titles in a row, the Gunners had to settle for second and City bounced back from some big setbacks to secure third. It is no wonder, then, that the action has seen record TV figures, with there more and more upsets in a league that has often been criticised for a lack of competitiveness from top to bottom. But is that increased competitiveness hindering these teams in Europe? Arsenal’s season is over now. Manchester City and Chelsea have one more game – the Women’s FA Cup final on Sunday – but none will be in the Women's Champions League final the following weekend, as Barcelona take on Lyon in Turin. City had their own extraordinary circumstances at the beginning of this year that played a big part in a qualifying exit at the hands of Real Madrid. Chelsea only went one round further, knocked out in the group stages as Wolfsburg and Juventus progressed. The German side would go on to eliminate Arsenal in the quarter-finals, meaning its now 15 years since an English side was crowned European champion. Chelsea came closest to ending that barren run last year, but were beaten heavily by Barcelona in the final, eventually losing 4-1. If the WSL is in fact one of the best leagues in the world, what is going wrong on the continent? “It might be a loading issue and I think it might be something that we need to cooperate between the clubs in WSL,” Arsenal boss Jonas Eidevall said earlier this season when posed with the question. “We know that the games that we play in the FA Cup, in the WSL, in the [League] Cup, they will be intense games and it's a physical league with a physical style of football in England. “Then we need to see, okay, the teams playing in Europe, how can we make sure that they are rested and recovered as well as possible when they're playing games in Europe? “Because we are not only representing ourselves in Europe. We are representing England with the association coefficient which will, in every five-year period, determine how many spots England will have in the Champions League, what ranking we will have and how easy it will be for us to get into the tournament. “When we are playing, for example, Barcelona on a Tuesday. Originally, our game against Aston Villa was Sunday night and we were supposed to play Tuesday night at Barcelona which would have been almost an impossible turnaround. “[It] required a lot of effort from the club and other people to get that game turned around on the Saturday. But still with a late kick-off. “For me, it would just be interesting to see if the clubs would come together and try to talk because, if you look at the schedule now - after we played Hoffenheim on the Thursday, there was actually a free weekend in the WSL before the international break. “For me, us playing this congested, it would have made every sense for us to move a game out from this period and to put that onto the weekend after the Hoffenheim game. “It would have given us so many better possibilities to play the Champions League games with as strong a squad as possible. But that, I think, is a league decision and it needs to be made by the clubs and we need to cooperate. “We need to try and talk about the principles on how we treat English clubs playing in Europe to make sure that the clubs get the best possible conditions to perform - because it's so hard and we need to have every percentage with us so we can start beating Spanish teams and get more success here for English clubs.” That is not a new problem for English football, either. On the men’s side, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is among those regularly slating the scheduling, stating it is why English teams struggle to win the quadruple. But it is a remarkable complaint on the women’s side given that there are only 22 games played per club in the WSL, compared to 38 in the Premier League. In that sense, it should not be a problem. Yet it clearly is, with Eidevall making a good point. That is not the sole reason for the performances of English sides in Europe this term. The success of clubs like Lyon and Wolfsburg over the last 10 years have been down to strong investment, good strategy and clever planning. It will naturally take time for others to catch up – not just in England either. Barcelona’s rise might seem overnight to some, yet it is anything but. You can also point to tactical shortcomings at times when it comes to WSL clubs in the Champions League – or simply great performances from the opposition, such as Juventus’ excellently executed game plan against Chelsea at the end of 2021. There is no single reason why the WSL’s strength as a league has not translated into ending the barren run of European triumphs in the last 15 years. But for all the explanations that could be given for a successful domestic season not translating onto the wider stage, it would be absolutely foolish should the league and the Football Association allow scheduling to be one. As much as both want the WSL to grow, it should be doing all it can to ensure progress in Europe too – and once the dust settles on Sunday's spectacle, it certainly should be something on the mind to address and assist with in any way possible, as soon as possible, before England falls further behind.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/wsl-has-thrilling-conclusion-but-must-not-follow-premier/blt8877b4182a4486bf,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2752,"Bronze & Williamson return, Houghton missing as England announce Arnold Clark Cup squad","England head coach Sarina Wiegman has revealed her squad for the upcoming Arnold Clark Cup, with Ellie Roebuck, Lucy Bronze and Leah Williamson all returning, while captain Steph Houghton misses out through injury. The Lionesses welcome Canada, Germany and Spain for the inaugural edition of the new tournament later this month, the first fixtures to take place at Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium on February 17. Canada are Olympic gold medallists, Germany are eight-time European champions and Spain are a nation massively on the rise, so the competition should serve as perfect preparation for Wiegman's side ahead of this summer's UEFA Women's Euros, also to be hosted by England. There is lots of positive news for England ahead of this international window, with goalkeeper Roebuck, full-back Bronze and the versatile Williamson all back after injury. Manchester City duo Roebuck and Bronze both missed the first half of the season, the former through a calf injury and the latter after knee surgery in the summer. However, both have been playing regularly for their club since Christmas after returning to fitness. Everton shot-stopper Sandy MacIver misses out due to Roebuck's return. Williamson suffered a hamstring injury before Christmas that kept her out for a couple of months, but she too has returned for Arsenal since England's last camp in November. Captain Houghton is missing, the centre-back struggling for fitness at the moment. She recently suffered a setback to do with her achilles, which she injured back in September. Chelsea striker Beth England is also injured and not involved. Speaking upon the announcement of her squad, Wiegman said: ""I am looking forward to playing against three world-class teams. It will be the perfect way to begin a big year, and we will get a lot of important information from the matches ahead of the Euros. ""We will play three games in a short period and can rotate lots of players which will help us understand more about our squad and the way we want to play. I know the players will be excited to test themselves against strong opponents. ""This tournament can only help us on our way to being ready for the Euros. That is what we are all working towards. It will also be special to go to three top stadiums in different parts of the country and I am sure the fans will give us great support once again."" Tickets to watch England, Germany, Spain and Canada play in the Arnold Clark Cup are available now. Matches are being broadcast live in the UK on ITV. Goalkeepers: Mary Earps, Hannah Hampton, Ellie Roebuck. Defenders: Millie Bright, Lucy Bronze, Jess Carter, Niamh Charles, Rachel Daly, Alex Greenwood, Demi Stokes, Leah Williamson, Lotte Wubben-Moy.

2759,Spain are not favourites for the UEFA Women’s Euros - despite boasting Barcelona UWCL winners,"In some ways, it’s understandable that many are making Jorge Vilda’s Spain the favourites for this year’s UEFA Women’s Euro. La Roja have not won either of their two games in the Arnold Clark Cup this month, but ahead of their final fixture with Canada, opposing head coach Bev Priestman joined a long list of people to dub them the outright front-runner for this summer’s competition. “I think they're a team that are brilliant on the ball and it asks questions of you defensively,” she said.  “You have to be really disciplined defensively to be able to cope with them and how much they move the ball. You have to do a lot of work. They've got top, top players.” A huge chunk of this Spain team plays for Barcelona, the reigning European champions who showed themselves to be streets ahead of the rest of the continent last season – something they’ve carried into the current season, too. It’s easy, then, for people to look at the mass representation of Women’s Champions League winners in this side and assume they’re on the same level. Many of the Barca stars in Spain’s squad are among the world’s best players – including Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas – and the names in Vilda's squad that are not based in Catalonia are richly talented, too, such as Manchester United full-back Ona Batlle or Real Madrid striker Esther Gonzalez. But this month’s Arnold Clark Cup has reminded a lot of people of one thing that is often forgotten: Spain are not Barcelona. There is a different coach, a slightly different way of playing and several players that aren’t used to playing together, too. La Roja opened this tournament with a dominant performance against a very depleted Germany, but conceded a late equaliser in a 1-1 draw.  In the second round of fixtures, they were held gain, this time 0-0 against a heavily-rotated, but well-drilled, England side. Some may have tuned in expecting to see the free-scoring Barcelona side that has conquered Europe, and they are getting to see many of those familiar faces, but they’re in Spain colours.  It’s simply not the same – and that’s fine. It’s perfectly understandable that Spain are not yet at an all-conquering level which it took Barca 10 years to reach. After all, this is a nation that has only recently risen to the fore in women’s football.  This is a nation that has never won a knockout game at a major tournament.  This is a nation that only qualified for its first World Cup in 2015.  This is a nation that was crippled by an allegedly toxic culture for 27 years, until head coach Ignacio Quereda was dismissed in the aftermath of their appearance in those finals. None of this is to downplay the quality in this team. It has the potential to be the very best in the world.  It doesn’t mean Vilda is immune to criticism, either. His team has not performed at the level it is capable of in this tournament and there has been some valid fault-finding as a result. “We have to be realistic,” Vilda said on Tuesday, asked about his thoughts on the ‘favourites’ tag. “I wouldn't change any of my players or any of my team for any others in the world, but looking across the board, other national teams have fantastic histories and are performing at very high levels as well. “At the moment, we're just trying to work hard, to do as well as we can, considering ourselves among the contenders – maybe a group of seven or eight teams – that are in contention to win the Euros. “At the same time, I think it could well be the tightest Euros in recent years. Everyone's striving to do as well as they can and lots of national teams have improved and got stronger in recent years. “We certainly don't feel like we are the favourites, but we feel like we are among the contenders.” That feels like a fair assessment – and one that it is important for people to hear. There’s no doubt about the quality within this Spain team and the potential they have. But to call them the favourite for a major tournament so soon? That doesn’t feel just.

2768,When Arsenal won the Champions League final: The quadruple icons who matched Invincibles era,"Just a couple of days before the first leg of the 2007 UEFA Women's Cup final, a bus full of journalists turned up to watch Arsenal train. Emma Byrne was stunned.  ""I was thinking, 'What the hell are these lads doing here?' There was very little coverage of women's football at the time,"" the former Gunners goalkeeper explains in an exclusive interview with GOAL ahead of the launch of Heineken's Fresher Football campaign. ""It also felt a bit strange for me, in particular, because usually I'd be swearing at all my defenders, so I felt like I had to watch what I was saying in front of them!  ""But I'll always remember that moment, seeing all those journalists streaming off the bus, because that was my first time realising that what we were doing in the Champions League was starting to generate real interest not only in our team, but also women's football in general."" Indeed, as far as Byrne is concerned, Arsenal's historic 2006-07 campaign was a pivotal moment in how the women's game was viewed, particularly in England. The Gunners' men's team had gone unbeaten during their 2003-04 Premier League triumph and 'The Invincibles' rightly remain lauded as one of the finest sides in English football history. What their female counterparts achieved 15 years ago was even more remarkable, though. Vic Akers’ squad swept all before them, winning a historic quadruple without losing a single game.  Arsenal’s women were the dominant force in English football at the time but they were rank outsiders in the Champions League (or the UEFA Women’s Cup as it was called back then).  Indeed, no side outside of Scandinavia or Germany had ever previously made the final. Then, there was the fact that Arsenal faced Umea in the final, a superstar-studded side spearheaded by a 21-year-old Brazilian by the name of Marta. “I knew all about her and I was thinking, 'Oh sh*t, she's probably going to destroy us!'” Byrne admits, laughing. “I still wanted to play but she was truly unbelievable. “My dad still talks about Marta and he sometimes forgets my name! So, nobody expected us to even have a chance. It was two legs at the times, so it was double the trouble.” Arsenal travelled to Sweden for the first leg and did so without the suspended Kelly Smith, who had been sent off against Brondby in the semi-finals. The odds had already been firmly stacked against them. After all, they were facing a side that had already lifted the European Cup twice, and playing in their fourth final in sixth years.  However, Arsenal triumphed 1-0 thanks to a late goal from Alex Scott.  #OnThisDay in 2007... @UWCL history! ❤️We remain the first - and only - British club to win the Champions League! 🏆 pic.twitter.com/sA1LIvamCT “Nobody thought we'd still be in the tie after the first leg, so for us to win over there was unreal,” Byrne says. “But we couldn't even be too happy about it, cos we were all just thinking, 'Oh no, now we've angered them!' And we did.  “They were so annoyed we'd beaten them. They threw everything at us in the return game.” Umea laid siege to the Arsenal goal at Meadow Park but could find no way through. Byrne made one fantastic stop after another but, as she freely admits, she also benefited from one big stroke of luck late on.  “When the final whistle blew, I literally couldn’t believe it because, just before the end, one shot flew past me and I looked back thinking it was already in the back of the net,” she says, “but the ball came  back off the post and hit me in the face, and then went out for a corner.  “I still don't know how that even happened. But everything was just going our way at that stage. It was very lucky but I think we deserved it in the end because we worked so hard. “The season itself was really difficult. We’d been dominating domestically but, to be quite honest, we probably thought the Champions League was a bit of a stretch for us. “And you have to remember that we weren’t full time back then. We were all working as well, so it was a really difficult season for us because it was so long. It was never-ending. 🗓 #OnThisDay in 2007, we defeated Charlton 4-1 in @TheWomensFACup and completed an unprecedented #quadruple 🤩#WeAreTheArsenal ❤️ pic.twitter.com/OSQ9V60AM7 “Then, the further we got in the Champions League, the more difficult it was to focus on domestic games, because even just making the Champions League was just a massive, massive thing for us.  “It definitely took most of our attention and even after the Champions League, we still had the FA Cup final to play, and even that was difficult trying to regain our focus, because we were still celebrating winning that trophy!"" However, Arsenal managed to refocus and completed their unprecedented quadruple by beating Charlton 4-1 at the City Ground. What made that triumph even more satisfying for Byrne and her colleagues was that the game was played before a crowd of just under 25,000 spectators – almost double the previous record for a Women’s FA Cup final. ""Personally, I think our Champions League win was the catalyst for the improvement in the relationship between women's football and the media, particularly in England,” the Irishwoman adds.  “After that, we all started to get more interview requests and calls from journalists. So, that felt like the start of the growth in popularity. “It’s obviously taken a long time, though. Only now are we at this great place where women's football is getting the respect it's always deserved.” And it’s high time that Arsenal’s quadruple winners do too. ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-champions-league-quadruple-icons-matched-invincibles/blt72ca3b7015e5e6a9,Mark Doyle,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2771,Todd Boehly-Clearlake consortium completes £4.25bn takeover of Chelsea ending 19-year Roman Abramovich reign,"The Todd Boehly-Clearlake Capital consortium has officially completed the purchase of Chelsea, ending Roman Abramovich's 19-year spell running the club. The total investment will cost £4.25 billion ($5.2bn), with £2.5bn ($3.2bn) ending up being the sale price of the club, while there is an agreement in place that £1.75bn (2.1$bn) will be invested over 10 years.  The purchase agreement was signed a fortnight ago and has been waived through by the Premier League Owners' and Directors' test, while the UK government, Portuguese authorities and European Union (EU) have all approved the financial transaction.  The club published a lengthy statement on Monday afternoon, which began: ""Roman Abramovich has completed the sale of Chelsea Football Club and related companies to an investment group led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital."" It then went into detail over the complicated process involved in selling the club after it was first put up for sale in early March. The statement read: ""The process was extremely thorough and completed on an accelerated timeline. Many described the proposed transaction as “unprecedented”, and it was. A transaction such as this would normally take nine months to a year to complete; we did it in less than three months. ""The club received more than 250 enquiries from proposed purchasers, held detailed discussions with more than 100 individuals and entities, and entered into 32 confidentiality agreements, which allowed for due diligence with respect to confidential club information. ""Ultimately, the club received 12 credible bids, resulting in four and then three final bidders. The Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital consortium was chosen as the preferred bidder."" The statement concluded: ""	We would like to thank all of the bidders for their engagement, effort and participation in this process. ""We would also like to thank our men and women footballers, the staff of both teams, everyone in our academy, and in particular Thomas Tuchel and Emma Hayes for their patience and support during this process. And, of course, thank you to all our partners, staff and fans during this difficult phase for the club."" The statement, which was put out by the former Chelsea board as a final statement before the Boehly takeover, ended by thanking Abramovich for ""19 amazing, unforgettable years."" Boehly is the co-owner of Major League Baseball's (MLB) Los Angeles Dodgers and a minority investor in the National Basketball Association (NBA) team LA Lakers.  He tried to buy Chelsea in 2019 for £2.2bn ($2.7bn) only to see his offer rejected. He has publicly stated his interest in buying a Premier League team and is the face of this successful bid.  Todd Boehly and Thomas Tuchel on the pitch together at Stamford Bridge. #cfc pic.twitter.com/wlY7unsXyt Boehly is expected to take a seat on the board and a guiding role despite only having a minority stake.  The majority of the money has been put up by Clearlake Capital with both the private equity firm's co-founders José E. Feliciano and Behdad Eghbali to be involved. Mark Walter, who is the principal owner of the Dodgers, is also involved, along with Boehly's long-term associate and fellow billionaire Hansjorg Wyss.  In non-executive board and advisory roles are Danny Finkelstein, the Times columnist and Tory peer, along with Barbara Charone, who is a PR executive in London.  The Blues will no longer be a loss-making operation with Abramovich pumping in £1.5bn ($1.9bn) of his personal wealth to keep the club's lavish spending going.  That's not to say the new owners won't invest, having done so in the past with their other sports teams, but they will look to increase revenues to ensure the books are balanced.  It will be more akin to a Liverpool-style model with data driving many decisions at the club. They have also agreed to invest in Stamford Bridge, the academy, the Women’s Team and Kingsmeadow (women's team stadium) and continued funding for the Chelsea Foundation. Boehly is understood to have a detailed plan for the first-team stadium to bring it to the level of the top European football stadia.  As for summer targets, Tuchel will ask for central defenders initially and Boehly's group intends to renew contracts for key players including Mason Mount and Reece James.  The £2.5 bn ($3.2bn) purchase will end up going to a humanitarian charity to help the victims after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Former UNICEF executive Mike Penrose has been charged with setting up a foundation to receive the funds and give aid in the European warzone. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) are satisfied that Abramovich will not personally profit from the sale after receiving assurances and a legal structure that ensures he can't profit from the sale of his club. It follows accusations that Abramovich has close ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin. The Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries explained how the sale will work in practice: ""Now that the Government has issued the licence, we expect the ownership transfer to take place in the coming days subject to Roman Abramovich agreeing to the sale himself.  ""The net proceeds from the sale will be transferred from the buyers to a frozen UK bank account belonging to Fordstam [his holding company], the holding company owned by Mr Abramovich, which sold the Club. Any onward transfer of money will require further approval from the Government. ""Roman Abramovich has made a number of public statements regarding his intention to transfer the proceeds to the victims of the war in Ukraine. We have agreed a Deed of Undertaking in which he commits the proceeds to a charity in a jurisdiction agreed by the Government for the purposes of helping victims of the war in Ukraine.  ""Any future movement of the sale revenue will be assessed in line with sanctions obligations and the position outlined in the Deed. It will be up to the Government to decide whether to license any movement of funds from the frozen account.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/todd-boehly-completes-takeover-chelsea-abramovich/bltaa21228b2934a376,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2779,'We can challenge the USWNT!' – New Zealand star Bowen determined to avoid 'embarrassment' at SheBelieves Cup,"It was at the summer’s Olympic Games when the U.S. women’s national team last played New Zealand, its opponent on Sunday in the SheBelieves Cup. Looking back now, it is easy to forget how much the 6-1 result flattered the USWNT. It looks a thrashing on paper, but it was a game that New Zealand started well and one that, had the chances that came their way from an error-stricken American side been taken, it could’ve been different. A lot has changed since. Only nine players from the U.S. roster for that tournament have been picked by Vlatko Andonovski for the SheBelieves Cup. New Zealand also have a new manager, but Katie Bowen, the Kiwi who has spent the last 10 years playing her football in the States, says the two countries' last meeting will be on the mind this weekend. “That game was obviously super frustrating,” she tells GOAL. “We had two own goals and then the other ones were soft goals, in my opinion. ""It wasn't like they did 50 passes, broke us down and had a finish. But that's the States. They get the job done, which I really respect with them. It doesn't matter how it's going, they somehow find a way. “I don't think that score reflected how we actually performed, but at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter how we performed. What people remember is the 6-1 – and we definitely remember that. “I think that actually will, hopefully, add a bit of fuel to the fire though, because, for us, that's an embarrassing scoreline. We don't want to be embarrassed again and I think we can challenge them. “They've got strengths and weaknesses, just like we've got strengths and weaknesses. ""We have got to be clinical, because against the States, they're fast, they're athletic, you're not going to get 20 chances in a game. It's about making sure that when we do get those chances, we put it away, we execute our game plan. “I don't know if we'll watch film on the Olympics, but we obviously will remember how it felt and how it was, and we're just looking to improve on that for sure.” There are few players in New Zealand’s side that know the USWNT’s quality as well as Bowen. She’s been playing in the NWSL for the last six years, after being drafted by Andonovski himself when she came out of the University of North Carolina. There, she played for UNC’s women's soccer team, the Tar Heels, alongside USWNT internationals Crystal Dunn and Kealia Watt, Angel City’s Paige Nielsen and plenty more. “It was amazing, honestly,” Bowen remembers. “We were so competitive in training that the games were like the final product type thing. It was just so fun. ""In my opinion, we should have won more than one national championship. That's always kind of been frustrating. “It's a pretty high quality all round at somewhere like UNC – more colleges are getting like that – but I could tell immediately that Crystal was absolutely legit. “We would do the defensive drills and she would be absolutely world class at it. Then, we'd do the finishing or attacking drills and she would be world class as well. It's a player that you're just like 'Wow!' with. “Her versatility is not jack of all trades, master of none. She's actually mastering them all, which is incredibly rare in both the men's and women's game. “Playing with that level of players was so good for my personal development as well. Obviously, winning that College Cup was a huge deal and something that I'll never forget. “It did really prepare me [for the NWSL]. I think before going to UNC, I had a bit of a confidence issue with the national team and playing and not playing. I was struggling to sort of find myself. ""But when I got to UNC, it was a perfect fit for me. I got my confidence back.” The defender will return to North Carolina after the SheBelieves Cup is over, too, having just signed for the North Carolina Courage after a difficult situation over Christmas. “I unexpectedly got waived from Kansas [City Current],” she explains. “They offered me a contract. I kind of thought that I was going back to Kansas. ""But then, out of the blue – two days before Christmas, for no apparent reason that I knew of – they waived me. That was a bit of a shock. “That was pretty steep because you never want to get waived. You never want to feel like you're not valued, type thing. That was a bit of a hit to my confidence. ""But, not long after, I got in touch with [Courage coach] Sean Nahas and had a really good conversation with him.” She’ll see a familiar face there in Abby Erceg, the New Zealand captain, after being sold by the picture Nahas painted of the “family environment”. “That's huge in the Ferns,” Bowen says. “I think that's probably one of our biggest strengths over our competitors, so that struck a chord with me.” New Zealand will hope that tight-knit atmosphere can help them get some revenge over the U.S. in California on Sunday. The Kiwis lost 1-0 to Iceland in the opening fixture of the SheBelieves Cup and will need a result to achieve their aims for the tournament of finishing in the top two. The team has come even closer together over the last year, too, after defender Rebekah Stott was diagnosed with Stage 3 Hodgkin's lymphoma. In July, she announced that her cancer was in remission and this month she is back with the national team for the first time. “There have been quite a few tears shed, because it's just a really unfortunate experience, but one where we've all kind of grown with her and got so much strength from her,” Bowen says. “Someone going through that and finally getting back on tour is just absolutely amazing. We have the utmost respect for Stotty and the team certainly has not been the same without her. “We're really going to utilise her battle and her strength and try and replicate that in our games this tournament.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uswnt-new-zealand-star-bowen-avoid-embarrassment-shebelieves/blte63e3abfab5998ce,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2782,New Zealand defender scores three own goals against USWNT,"New Zealand defender Meikayla Moore scored three own goals in the first half of the SheBelives Cup on Sunday as the United States Women's National Team took full control of the tie early on. USWNT are taking on New Zealand in California as part of the competition, which also includes Czech Republic and Iceland.  But Liverpool centre-back Moore had a horrific first half for the visiting side. USWNT found themselves ahead just five minutes into the tie when Moore diverted a cross into her own net. A minute later, Sofia Huerta sent a diagonal ball into the box for Margaret Purce, but Moore once again ended up knocking it past the goalkeeper. name's Purce, because @100Purcent is always in her bag 👜 pic.twitter.com/GAss2w9txG Purce then ran down the right side before sending in a low cross where Moore's failed clearance from close range ended up hitting the net.

2841,"Four key changes made to Ballon d’Or award process as Messi, Mbappe and Co pursue 2022 prize","The Ballon d’Or is considered to be one of the most prestigious prizes in football, with some iconic names having won the award multiple times down the years, but the criteria for claiming that particular trophy is being tweaked by France Football for the current year and beyond. Argentine superstar Lionel Messi was the last man to land the award, with the Barcelona legend, now at Paris Saint-Germain, being recognised in 2021 as the best player on the planet for the seventh time in his illustrious career. Eternal rival Cristiano Ronaldo has taken top honours on five occasions in the past, while Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten all have three successes to their name. They were all judged on the basis of their efforts across a calendar year, but that is about to change, with a new system based on performance within a single season being implemented. The winner of Ballon d'Or 2022 will be ___________ 🏆 pic.twitter.com/7KL7otwYwv France Football, which has been handing out the award since 1956 and introduced the Ballon d’Or Feminin in 2018, has revealed that four key changes will be made to the process of identifying the world’s finest talent. “Because the award was originally designed to celebrate the best player of the year, since then no change has taken place at this level. The BdO celebrates the strongest from January to December, which obliges, de facto, to judge and gauge two half-seasons - January-July and August-December (sometimes accompanied by club changes in the off-season) - rather than one season in its entirety and continuity. “Also, by proceeding with a slight shift in time, with an abandonment of the calendar rhythm and an alignment of the BdO (men and women) on the classic seasonality of football - for the month of August, which coincides with the start of the major championships and the European preliminary rounds, the following July, which corresponds to the lowering of the curtain for all competitions, national and international, selections included - we end up with a clarification of the performances to be counted and evaluated. The next edition will therefore take into account the entire 2021-22 season which will end with the Women's Euro (July 6-31, 2022). The World Cup in Qatar (November 21-December 18, 2022) will, however, be included in the 2023 Ballon d'Or edition.” No more January to December. The #ballondor will now be awarded on the basis of a classic football season : August to July! 📅No worries, the Qatar World Cup will count for the 2023 award. pic.twitter.com/BPvNp4jTNM “Because the Ballon d'Or begins as soon as the famous lists of nominees are drawn up (thirty for men, twenty for women and ten for the Yachine and Kopa Trophies), it was decided to reinforce this essential step. In order to present a selection of suitors as fair, indisputable and relevant as possible, we acted to change the process which, until now, mainly involved the writers of France Football. To the lists of FF (and L'Équipe) journalists will now be added BdO ambassador Didier Drogba (for the men's BdO and the Yachine and Kopa Trophies) as well as the voter who has shown himself to be the most insightful in the previous edition. “Among the men, for the next edition, it will be the Vietnamese Truong Anh Ngoc (The Thao & Van Hoa). Among the women, it will be the Czech juror Karolina Hlavackova (Ruik), to deliver her twenty applicants. From these lists will come the final official lists which will be unveiled in September.” “Because the Ballon d'Or has gone from sixteen European jurors (1956) to one hundred and seventy (2021) spread all over the world, it can boast of an astonishing and indisputable universality. This is what contributes to its influence and reputation. However, is the judgment ten times finer and better with ten times more jurors? Couldn't the gigantic size of the jury end up weakening it? Did the openness to ""small"" countries (those which have neither a big natural football culture nor historical legitimacy and not always easy access to images of the main competitions) risk from time to time impacting the ballot due to lack of adequate knowledge or expertise? “As there is no question of abandoning the founding democratic principle (all votes are equal, whatever the country), the idea is therefore to limit the jury to an ""elite"", to real connoisseurs. Thus, only the representatives of the first hundred countries in the FIFA rankings (and the fifty for women) will be ""qualified"" to vote. A tightening that reinforces the level of expertise and limits the (rare) fanciful votes. What will be lost in picturesqueness will be gained in legitimacy and reliability.” “Because the rules have not changed much since their inception and the criteria frequently give rise to debate, we thought it appropriate to refresh the hierarchy of the constituent elements in the vote for greater consistency and clarity. And avoid any ambiguities. The Ballon d'Or is an individual award. Also, logically, criterion number 1 will focus primarily on individual performance and the decisive and impressive character of the contenders. “Since football remains a collective sport despite everything, criterion number 2 will focus on collective performance and the record accumulated during the season. Finally, criterion number 3 will concern the class of the player and his sense of fair play. Because setting an example also counts. The most attentive will have noticed the disappearance of the ""player's career"" criterion. A way of considering the race for the Ballon d'Or as an open competition, and not as a preserve.” Alongside the elite group of players with three or more triumphs to their name, Alfredo Di Stefano, Franz Beckenbauer, Kevin Keegan, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Ronaldo all have two wins apiece. Stanley Matthews was the first recipient back in 1956, while Raymond Kopa, Luis Suarez, Omar Sivori, Josef Masopust, Denis Law and Eusebio claimed the prize through the first 10 years of its existence. Legendary goalkeeper Lev Yashin took top spot in 1963 and remains the only shot-stopper to claim a Golden Ball, while Bobby Charlton’s exploits with World Cup winners England in 1966 landed him the prize that year. Since then the likes of George Best, Gianni Rivera, Gerd Muller, Oleg Blokhin, Allan Simonsen, Paolo Rossi, Igor Belanov, Ruud Gullit, Lothar Matthaus, Jean-Pierre Papin, Roberto Baggio, Hristo Stoichkov, George Weah, Matthias Sammer, Zinedine Zidane, Rivaldo, Luis Figo, Michael Owen, Pavel Nedved, Andriy Shevchenko, Fabio Cannavaro, Kaka and Luka Modric have added their names to a notable roll of honour.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/four-key-changes-ballon-d-or-award-process-messi-mbappe-2022/blt6299b2a6299cdaf8,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2892,Riola Xhemaili: Switzerland's teenage Euros star who grew up idolising Ronaldo,"When Ana-Maria Crnogorcevic, Barcelona’s two-time European champion, sat down with Switzerland team-mate Riola Xhemaili ahead of the Women’s Euros, UEFA asked her to describe what it feels like to win big titles to the 19-year-old. “Haven’t you already won something?” Crnogorcevic asked. “Not yet,” she said. “It will come,” Crnogorcevic replied. “Don’t worry.” It is easy for the Barca star to be so confident, as the talent her teenage team-mate possesses is truly something special. Xhemaili is at her first major tournament this summer as the youngest member of the Swiss squad, a feat which comes after her first season in one of Europe’s top leagues, the Frauen-Bundesliga, with Freiburg. What is most remarkable, then, given the huge 12 months she has had at such a young age, is it was only eight years ago that Xhemaili started playing football for a team. It didn’t take long for her switch from volleyball to pay off. At the age of 15, she made her debut for Basel and was playing in the Switzerland youth teams. In the latter half of the following year, she would wear the captain’s armband for her club and make her senior international debut. “I am a personality who can deal well with the pressure of expectations,” Xhemaili, who cites Cristiano Ronaldo as her biggest idol, said back in 2020 as her stock was on the rise. It’s part of the reason why she’s been able to hit so many milestones so quickly. It was before those headline-grabbing exploits that Birgit Bauer, head of the women's and girls' football department at SC Freiburg, first saw her play, in a game between two junior teams of Freiburg and Basel. From there, she knew she had to sign her. “Riola is extremely secure on the ball,” Bauer tells GOAL, recalling the traits that stood out to her that day. “She's a really good technician. She also has a very good eye - she can read the game well.” Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: Xhemaili would be 18 when she moved to Germany. Joining a club renowned for its work with young players – playing a huge role in the careers of stars like Giulia Gwinn and Klara Buhl – feels like the perfect step for her. “Coming to Germany from Switzerland is not that easy,” Bauer says. “The Bundesliga has a different quality. This was also noticed in Rio. She had initial difficulties, but always gave everything. She has become very valuable for our game.” The stats back that up. By the end of the campaign, Xhemaili had six assists, the most of any Freiburg player, and had scored her first goal in the division. She had also become a fixture in Switzerland’s starting XI. “Sometimes you have to discipline her a little bit, but it’s nice,” laughs Coumba Sow, the scorer of Switzerland’s first goal at the Euros, when asked what it’s like to play with the teenager in midfield. “She’s tricky in her mind.” La Nati go into their final group game at the Women’s Euros, against reigning champions the Netherlands, with a point on the board and in need of a win to progress. Xhemaili will be hoping to make her competition debut in the high-stakes encounter. Whether she gets on the pitch or not, though, the experience she is getting in England will be incredibly beneficial when she returns to Germany to complete just her second season outside of her home country. There, Xhemaili has a new coach, Theresa Merk, who cannot wait to work with her. Merk joins Freiburg after spending a year in Switzerland hearing all about the midfielder’s abilities, while also having the chance to see her train and play with the national team, too. “Riola is a quite technical player who has her biggest strengths in the offensive game,” Merk says, describing her first impressions of the 19-year-old to GOAL. “She is able to create dangerous situations for herself around the box but also by playing creative passes to her team-mates so they are able to score. “There is always a need for creative and offensive midfielders who always want to have the ball and know what to do with it. We want to play that kind of football so it covers a lot of her strengths.” Merk talks about that ability on the ball again when asked what makes her most look forward to working with the teenager, before adding: “It is also exciting how open she is to learn new things and cope with a new system and style of play.” But there is another quality of Xhemaili’s that must be noted too, which Bauer believes also makes her “important”. “She is never in a bad mood,” she explains. “She’s always in a good mood and spreads this good mood.” From being a teenage captain at Basel to one of Switzerland’s most exciting young prospects, with all those traits combined, it’s no wonder Xhemaili has become a valuable member of each team she has played in so far – and will no doubt continue to be as this promising career unfolds.

2940,USWNT lawsuit: Why $24m settlement needed a national team legend to step in on the opposite side,"Since the U.S. women's national team's inception in the 1980s, each subsequent generation of players has had a remit beyond any on-field objectives: leave things better than they found them. As important as winning gold medals and World Cups has been, moving the ball forward on compensation, benefits, working conditions and equitable treatment has been equally significant. In that sense, Tuesday’s news that the USWNT and U.S. Soccer had reached a $24 million (£18m) settlement in their equal pay lawsuit (contingent on a new collective bargaining agreement) was just another milestone in a long, drawn-out struggle that will continue long after each member of the current team has kicked their last ball in anger. It’s only fitting it required a player involved in that struggle in the 1990s to help broker an agreement between two warring factions this time around. The only difference this time around was that she was on the opposite side. “This is just one step towards rebuilding our relationship with the women's team,” U.S. Soccer president Cindy Parlow Cone said on a conference call Tuesday. “This is a great accomplishment. I think everyone should be excited about today.” Parlow Cone was the youngest player on the 1996 Olympic squad, which saw nine of its top players hold out and threaten to boycott the Olympics if they didn’t receive improved contracts. U.S. Soccer relented, and the USWNT won gold in the first ever Olympic women’s soccer tournament. Proud of this historic moment and excited to move forward together with our players to grow soccer and advance opportunities for women and girls around the world. https://t.co/MCFsjZjJdM Parlow Cone was also on the mythical 1999 World Cup team, which won the tournament on home soil and then threatened to embark on its own victory tour if the federation didn’t improve their contract terms. Once again, U.S. Soccer met the players’ demands, and the USWNT participated in the federation-sanctioned victory tour. “From its inception, we've had women fight for better pay and better working conditions and to be treated more fairly and with more respect, and every generation has taken on that fight to close the gap,” USWNT captain Becky Sauerbrunn said. Parlow Cone entered the picture when the relationship between U.S. Soccer and the USWNT was at its lowest point, with federation president Carlos Cordeiro forced to resign in disgrace after overseeing a legal strategy that questioned the value of his players based on their gender. “I'll be the first to admit the federation has made mistakes in the past,” said Parlow Cone, who was U.S. Soccer vice-president during Cordeiro’s time at the helm. ""And, as a former player, I definitely understand the frustration of being treated that way and of dealing with my predecessor."" Parlow Cone’s call-out of Cordeiro was strategically timed, with the two set to go head-to-head for the U.S. Soccer presidency next weekend. Cordeiro is hoping to regain his former position with the backing of several factions of the electorate, which certainly will not include USWNT players. In hindsight, it’s clear that Parlow Cone’s elevation into the presidency was the vital moment in the road to a lawsuit settlement, and USWNT players have no interest in returning to the former status quo. No amount of words can say thank you enough to all of the USWNT players who have been fighting for this for so many years. Not only for themselves but for the next generation and every single one after that. Thank you for never giving up and teaching us to never settle for less. ""Cindy, this is a thank you to you for your leadership,"" Sauerbrunn said. ""You became president at a time when I think our relationship with the federation was at its worst. ""You opened up dialogue with the players and you did exactly what you said you were going to do."" Megan Rapinoe was even more explicit, recalling an embarrassing moment when Cordeiro mispronounced her name during a celebration of their 2019 World Cup win. ""I think Carlos does know my last name but he's certainly not getting my vote,"" the forward said. Rapinoe, Sauerbrunn and several of their teammates who were most prominent in the current struggle are in the twilight of their national team careers. The torch is set to be passed and the younger generation appears ready to pick up where their predecessors left off. Sophia Smith, who at 21 looks set to be a USWNT standard-bearer for years to come, posted a note of gratitude on Twitter to players who fought “not only for themselves but for the next generation and every single one after that.” “That message was one of the best,” Sauerbrunn said of Smith’s tweet. “To know that we the players have built a culture that has instilled a sense of value and fight I think is a legacy that we're truly proud to leave behind.” “For the future generations... to have them understand not just that things are going to be better, but it's their responsibility to make them better,” Rapinoe added. “Hopefully, we've left them with a much bigger toolbox and a better roadmap for doing that.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uswnt-lawsuit-settlement-needed-national-team-legend/blt9971d82354570d14,By Seth Vertelney,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2941,"Angel City sporting director Eni Aluko on having Natalie Portman as her boss, meeting Mia Hamm and NWSL expansion team's targets","Angel City sporting director Eni Aluko has opened up on having Natalie Portman as her boss and meeting Mia Hamm, while also discussing the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) expansion team's targets. Aluko announced her retirement from football in January 2020 after a stellar 19-year career that saw her take in spells at Chelsea, Atlanta Beat, Sky Blue FC, Birmingham City and Juventus. The 35-year-old, who also won 102 caps for England, moved to the United States the following year, taking up a boardroom role with Angel City ahead of their inaugural NWSL season. Hollywood actor Portman forms part of the club's majority-female ownership group, which boasts a whole host of high-profile investors. Former United States women's star and two-time World Cup winner Hamm is among those to have helped found the new NWSL outfit, who are set to make their debut in the competition later this month. Aluko says it was a ""privilege"" for her to meet Portman and Hamm, along with the rest of the backroom team at Angel City, and she is fully committed to bringing their vision to life in the coming years. ""Meeting them was surreal,"" she told BBC Sport. ""I remember meeting Mia Hamm in Los Angeles for the first time and I was just like 'wow, it's Mia Hamm, this is ridiculous'. ""I watched Julie Foudy win the World Cup, Abby Wambach win the World Cup - and now they are my colleagues. ""Natalie Portman is my boss. I have met her several times, spoken to her kids about football and what training session we are doing - it is a privilege to be given the responsibility to try to build something that is the idea of all these amazing people."" Aluko is excited for what the future holds at Angel City, but is careful to avoid making any unrealistic promises as an untested squad embarks on its maiden NWSL campaign. ""We have to be careful to have a balance between being ambitious and understanding how difficult it is to come in and win straight away,"" she said when asked about her short-term goals with the Los Angeles-based club. ""For us, it is about saying 'can we be the most successful expansion team in the NWSL?' ""There has been lots of talk and now we want to see the action on the pitch. We want to see goals, we want to see defending, great assists, the team really gelling together on the pitch. That is why we are doing this.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/angel-city-sporting-director-eni-aluko-natalie-portman-boss/blt7f3f0a5e3a1e2200,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

3009,From an unstoppable Barcelona to Juventus' growth: Five things we learned from the Women's Champions League,"The penultimate round of this season’s Women’s Champions League group stage fixtures provided plenty to talk about, as the last eight really started to take shape. Juventus’ trip to Chelsea was the most intriguing of the week’s games, setting up a thrilling finale in Group A, which also contains two-time winners Wolfsburg. Meanwhile, the Emirates Stadium hosted UWCL football for the first time as Arsenal welcomed reigning champions Barcelona. Here are five things that we learned... “We were just happy to be in the group stages,” Juventus head coach Joe Montemurro said after his side’s draw at Chelsea on Wednesday. The result saw Juve become the first team to stop the Blues from scoring at Kingsmeadow this season – and they could’ve nicked the win, too. ""I've had experience at this ground. You don't come here and win easily or get a point easily, so for a club that's four years old, in its first real foray into Champions League, to get something, it's quite special."" The performance that Juve put on was typical of an Italian side away in Europe. It was excellent. Midfielder Martina Rosucci described the game plan as “perfect”. To see such a performance from a Montemurro side, who usually play so expansively, was another nod to his growth as a coach in Italy.  With the game there growing at the same rate, the Bianconere are making incredibly encouraging strides as they go into the final game with qualification in their own hands. This ambitious Real Madrid side have not had a great first half of the season. They are ninth in their league standings, sacked head coach David Aznar and have been fortunate not to be in a more testing group. However, this week, Kosovare Asllani returned after over two months out and showed that she can help ignite the team. At her best when playing close to a No.9, she shone in her role next to Esther Gonzalez on Wednesday, scoring two goals, winning a penalty and creating three chances in Real Madrid’s 3-0 win over Breidablik. Her return is huge for this team. When Erin Cuthbert joined Chelsea five years ago, she arrived as a raw attacking talent, an 18-year-old who had just finished as Glasgow City’s top goalscorer as they continued their dominance in Scotland. On Wednesday night, she shone against Juventus, but as a full-back. With the Blues lacking depth in that area, she’s played regularly as a wing-back this season in a role that suits so many of her great traits: her grittiness, her work-rate, her intelligence but also her attacking qualities too. It was just another brilliant display in a season which has seen her keep quiet some of the game’s most electric wingers, while also being an attacking threat herself. Earlier this week, after Chelsea’s FA Cup win over Arsenal, manager Emma Hayes simply said: “People like Erin Cuthbert are some of the reasons why we are what we are – and she deserves all the credit.” It’s hard to disagree. In his pre-match press conference, Arsenal head coach Jonas Eidevall was asked what he admired about Barcelona. As he rattled through their qualities, his answer was three minutes long. That was a clear indication of how good the reigning European champions are. On Thursday, they were without Patri Guijarro, who tested positive for Covid-19 just before the game. To be without your holding midfielder is a big deal for most. However, Barca simply dropped Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas back from her advanced midfield role and let her control the game instead. They won 4-0. Arsenal tried a different game plan from their 4-1 defeat in Spain, Eidevall having learned from that. But, in reality, stopping this team – even without Guijarro and star centre-back Mapi Leon – remains the toughest task in the women's game right now. Should they not win the Champions League again this season, it would be a huge shock.

Every other group had two teams more comfortably positioned than the others. Going into the final games, it's only the aforementioned group that doesn't have its two progressing teams confirmed, and Group C, where a truly incredible turn of events in Arsenal's clash with Hoffenheim would see the Germans advance instead. The group stages have been entertaining, but it will take time for other teams in Europe to catch up to those elite sides to create more drama. This new format, giving less experienced teams games against the giants, will certainly help.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/unstoppable-barcelona-juventus-growth-five-things-women-s/blt6207fb99094ff10c,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3037,From Chelsea's problematic defence to USWNT star Macario's excellence: Five things we learned from the Women's Champions League,"The sixth and final matchday in the Women’s Champions League group stages was certainly not without its drama. Arsenal were all-but-through to the quarter-finals, yet were dealt an incredible scare, while Chelsea and Wolfsburg faced off for what was effectively a winner-takes-all showdown. Here is what we learned from the latest round of action in this season's UWCL... The shock of the week saw Chelsea, last season’s runners-up, crash out in the group stages of this year’s competition, with Wolfsburg hammering them 4-0 in Germany. All four goals were extremely poor from the Blues’ perspective, with the Wolves getting into the channels either side of the opposing centre-backs to cause serious problems. With manager Emma Hayes unable to address the lack of full-back options in the transfer window – despite going after targets – players are out of position in those areas, which certainly brings issues. Wolfsburg took full advantage on Thursday and others in the Women’s Super League will have taken note. Catarina Macario has played in plenty of different positions – in a playmaking midfield role, a little deeper sometimes, and leading the line in a front three. ""I'd say my preferred position would be a false nine,” she told GOAL on All of US: The U.S. Soccer Show, before adding: “[But] I'll try to do my best in whatever position.” Where the U.S. women’s national team star is best is up for debate, but one thing is for sure – she can light up a game from absolutely anywhere. On Wednesday, as Lyon secured top spot in their UWCL group with a 4-0 win over Hacken, nobody shone brighter than the 22-year-old, who was back in midfield. In her first full season with the seven-time European champions, Macario is certainly looking at home wherever she’s deployed. With 11 goals in all competitions already, she’s showing every sign of fulfilling her huge potential. To progress to the quarter-finals on Wednesday, Hoffenheim, the UWCL debutantes who are not a full-time team, needed to beat Arsenal, a professional outfit top of the Women’s Super League, by five goals. With 30 minutes to play, it was 4-1 to the German side. They were putting on an incredible show. Unfortunately for them, the Gunners recomposed themselves and didn't concede any more goals.  But the result was still huge. Hoffenheim’s starting XI had just two players in it over the age of 24. Teenage winger Jule Brand shone, scoring the opener, while another 19-year-old, Gia Corley, was electric in midfield. They may not have made it out of the group, but this experience of the group stages – where they won three out of six games and played the reigning European champions, Barcelona, twice – will stand them in good stead for the future. Given how they look right now, that’s incredibly exciting. 🇩🇪 Gia Corley vs Arsenal:22 touches7/9 passes completed(4/4 in final third)3/4 dribbles completed1 foul won1 assistBrilliant first half from the teenager. Every time she touches the ball, she - and Hoffenheim - look dangerous. #UWCL When Leah Williamson was diagnosed with a ""significant"" hamstring injury last month, everyone knew it would have an impact on Arsenal, such is her quality. A centre-back who rarely makes mistakes, adds pace to the defence and has a cool head, her presence has been missed massively in the six games the Gunners have played since, most notably in the Women’s FA Cup final defeat to Chelsea earlier this month. That was highlighted again on Wednesday against Hoffenheim.  While there were other factors in their defeat, and Williamson’s presence wouldn’t have solved all their problems, Arsenal need to find a new formula to cope with her absence if they are to maintain pole position in the WSL title race. The group-stage format has been something for all fans to enjoy. For the clubs involved, it's been a welcome change, too, but it is demanding, in terms of extra games and more travel. The fixture pile-up has certainly had an impact domestically, even though many big clubs boast large squads.  Chelsea rotated their team at the weekend and were beaten 1-0 by Reading. Wolfsburg, Bayern Munich and Hoffenheim all dropped points, while PSG and Lyon both won by narrow one-goal margins. ""Three games a week and the travel – that does something to teams,"" Wolfsburg CEO Ralf Kellerman said.  ""It was to be expected that the new Champions League format would make things a bit tighter in domestic leagues."" Maybe this new format, then, will generate more excitement across the board.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-defence-uswnt-star-macario-five-things-we-learned/bltf8110abc3eec2549,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3045,Watch: England duo Russo & Toone spy on Germany's tactical note during Euros final,"Ella Toone and Alessia Russo played smart to get a glimpse of Germany's tactical notes during the 2022 UEFA Women's Euros final on Sunday at Wembley. The two teams were locked in an intense battle until Chloe Kelly made the difference in the 114th minute with the eventual winner.  England bagged the title for the first time in their third attempt after twice coming close to taking the crown in 1984 and in 2009, with Toone and Russo both playing key roles.  Germany's Lena Lattwein had some instructions written on a piece of paper from manager Martina Voss to be passed on to the other defenders. She first handed over the paper to Kathrin Hendrich and while the defender was going through it, Toone tried to peep and even made a casual attempt to get hold of the paper.  Hendrich eventually passed it on to Sara Doorsun-Khajeh and then Russo got into the act, seemingly getting a good look at the note before play resumed.

3060,How England caught up with Germany to reach the Women's Euro final,"Last time the England women’s national team reached a European Championship final in 2009, they were massive underdogs. After finishing third in their group but navigating the knockout stages well, they were 2-0 down to Germany with just 22 minutes on the clock in a final that finished 6-2 and gave their old foe a seventh continental title. On Sunday, after 13 years away, the Lionesses are back in a major tournament final. Their opponents? Germany. It's a full circle journey for a team that has experienced quite a transformation since 2009. Even since these two last met at Wembley Stadium, in a friendly in November 2019 that ended 2-1 to Germany, things have altered dramatically. The progress has been so great that some will even call England the favourites to win on Sunday. That’s remarkable considering that, until 2015, they had never even beaten Germany. “It’s like night and day really,” Jill Scott said, asked about the differences between Sunday’s game and the Euro 2009 final. She is the only member of this summer’s squad who was involved in the tournament in Finland. Since then, it’s been what Scott describes as a “process” to close the gap. Step-by-step, England has established itself as one of the leading nations in women’s football. The first big step came just before that tournament, when central contracts of £16,000 (€19,000/$19,400) were introduced and given to 17 players. “The FA is really focused on the women's team,” Scott explained. “They invested a lot of money in the [Women’s Super League]. I know I keep using the word process, but that's what it's been to get to this level. “I think we have the best league in the world really, when you look at the competitiveness and the players that we have over here now. The [foreign] players that have come in over the years, it's been great [to have] different experiences, and then it's the younger players learning from those players as well. “There's been a lot of investment in the league. The crowds are getting better, the standard is getting better. The league seems to always go down to the wire, which is fantastic, whereas in the past, it was probably a foregone conclusion going into some games. You knew what the results were going to be and they might be high scoring. “Now, every single game is competitive, every single game is quite close as well. [The foreign players] have had a good influence and we want the best players in the league. The girls want to be playing against the best players every single week so that they can improve. “Maybe in the past, sometimes you played club football and then when you went to internationals, it was such a big jump. But I think now we're definitely bridging that gap to have the highest level every weekend so that when we go away with England, then we're already at that level.” Those in Germany are well aware of that progress, too. When head coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg was asked if it was possible to compare 2019’s friendly at Wembley to Sunday’s final, she said no. “England is three years more mature now,” she explained. “And I know that Sarina [Wiegman] is an incredible coach. We know each other’s strengths. It’s about small details, forcing certain things, making fewer mistakes. “We know what to expect so we will be ready. We both have high respect of each other. Sarina has shown what it takes to win a European title - and we hope it stays at one title!” The gap closing between these two teams is not all down to progress in England, though. Germany might be eight-time European champions but, after leading the way in the women’s game for many years, things have stalled and others have caught up. ""German clubs and the DFB are also under pressure when you look at the developments in other countries,” Bayern Munich midfielder Lina Magull, scorer of two goals in this tournament, said in an interview with GOAL and SPOX earlier this year. “That's why I think it has a small impact to speak out about it on a regular basis."" “We want more equality of talents,” Voss-Tecklenburg said on Saturday, when asked by GOAL what impact she hopes this tournament has at home. “[We want] better stadia, we want more spectators, we want more TV time, different kick-off times, a more attractive league - we want to make the next steps and I hope the sport in general will have a bigger importance in schools and education and politics. “It's not just an event that’s here and everybody is happy about it. Something has to continue. There has to be the chance for countries to make the next steps in women's football. If not now, when will it happen?” After beating France in the semi-finals, women’s football was on the front cover of Kicker, Germany’s biggest football magazine, for the first time. This weekend, there will be public screenings of the final across the country as this team goes in search of a ninth European title. They might be the most successful nation in this competition, but this is the final that feels like it could have the biggest impact on the German domestic game. With the quality that has been on show from these two sides this summer, both deserve to generate mass change regardless of Sunday’s result. Whoever lifts the trophy come full-time will also be an incredibly worthy winner.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-germany-womens-euro-2022-final/blt9a1bbefa385e65e0,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3075,Williamson named England captain for Arnold Clark Cup,"Leah Williamson has been named England captain for the Arnold Clark Cup as she continues to stand in for the injured Steph Houghton. Williamson, who has won 24 international caps to date, was initially handed the armband for Sarina Wiegman's first four games in charge of the Lionesses in September and October. With no return date yet set for Houghton, the Arsenal defender is being tasked with leading the team once again at the inaugural Arnold Clark Cup, which kicks off on Thursday. Williamson was one of 23 players to report for training on Tuesday morning, with Chelsea's Millie Bright also present and likely to take on vice-captaincy duties after wearing the armband against Austria and Latvia last year. The only notable absentee was Williamson's Arsenal team-mate Lotte Wubben-Moy, who is set to face a late fitness test. The centre-back missed the Gunners' Women's Super League draw with Chelsea last Friday due to injury and it is not yet known if she will recover in time for the opening Arnold Clark Cup fixture. The newly-formed tournament is being hosted in England, and will see four of the world's top 10 nations play round-robin matches at the Riverside Stadium, Carrow Road and Molineux. Germany, Spain and Canada will be competing alongside the Lionesses, and the trophy will go to the country that manages to earn the most points from the six fixtures to be played over the next week. England will open proceedings against Canada at the Riverside on Thursday before playing Spain at Carrow Road three days later, and their final outing against Germany will be staged at Molineux on February 23.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/williamson-named-england-captain-arnold-clark-cup/blt6905b4c7af741f4d,James Westwoood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3089,USWNT star Macario continues to justify the hype with Women's Champions League match-winning display for Lyon,"To best understand how highly rated Catarina Macario is, one only needs to open social media whenever the Lyon and U.S. women’s national team forward is on the pitch. On Sunday, it exploded as she scored twice in the Women’s Champions League semi-finals, giving Lyon a slender advantage going into the second leg with Paris Saint-Germain next weekend. Macario's first goal involved a lovely combination with Ada Hegerberg, the 2018 Ballon d’Or winner producing a wonderful first touch and pass for her team-mate, whose movement and anticipation was as impressive before she slotted the ball home. The second was a horror show from PSG’s defence, but again Macario was alert and sniffed out the chance to score. It was those instincts that proved the difference in the end, in a 3-2 win. Macario is a player whose short career thus far has brought with it incredible hype. She had a sensational college stint at Stanford, in which she twice won the Hermann Trophy, awarded to the best college soccer player. She then chose to forgo her senior season at one of the country’s best programmes to sign for the biggest and best team in the game – Lyon. The Brazil-born talent also opted to play for the United States, where she has lived since she was 12 years old, the biggest national team in the women’s game. For some, the pressure of these environments would be too much. But Macario continues to justify the hype around her. . @catarinamacario giving @OLfeminin the lead at the break 👊🇬🇧 🎙 👉 https://t.co/bq4hODCQhu🇫🇷 🎙 👉  https://t.co/zN67LlCJBF pic.twitter.com/mU1OlEjSSo In her first full senior season, she has been exceptional – Sunday was simply a reminder of that. She has 13 goals and four assists in 17 league games. In the Champions League, she has eight goals and two assists in 11 appearances – four of the former coming in the knockout stages. This is all from a player who is still just 22 years old and only made her senior debut last January. This incredible assimilation to the highest level is down to a few key factors. One is that the talent that Macario has is out of this world. Anyone who has ever watched her play knows that. Another is her ability to perform under pressure. That is because she has been dealing with it since she left home 10 years ago. When Macario and her family moved to the U.S., the main reason was for the benefit of her soccer career. That is intense. “Being a 12-year-old girl, you know that your family is doing this really thinking about you and almost seeing you as investment to your future… It definitely took a toll at times,” she told GOAL on 'All of US: The U.S. Women’s Soccer Show'. “If I had a bad game or something like that, especially in the very beginning, it was such a hard transitional period that I would just really get in my head. “[I’d] think [about] whether we had made the right decision, whether I was good enough, whether it was worth it to go through all this, being separate from my mother, spending so much money - I mean, in comparison to the currency of Brazil - just to try and make this dream happen.” When you have battled through that, you can cope with the Champions League. You can cope being part of the biggest club or national team in the women’s game. Better than cope – you can thrive. After settling into her new home in the second half of last season, Macario has established herself as an absolute star this campaign. She has begun to come to the fore in the USWNT, too, her sublime two-goal performance against Iceland in the SheBelieves Cup this year perhaps the game in which she really announced herself on the international level. At club level, when GOAL spoke to Lyon’s talented young defender Alice Sombath - who ranked at No.6 on the 2022 NXGN list - about the most difficult player to face in training, the 18-year-old picked Macario out above many who have been among the best in the world for years. “She protects the ball really, really well,” she said. “It's really hard to take the ball from her.” To become a stand-out player in a team like Lyon’s is a feat in itself. There are players in that squad who have won seven Champions League titles. On Sunday, Wendie Renard became the first player in the competition’s history to play 100 games. That is the calibre within the club. But Macario is doing exactly that. Lyon have not made things easy for themselves going into the second leg of this UWCL semi-final, though. They could have been more clinical and taken further advantage of PSG’s sloppiness, to take more than a one-goal advantage to Paris. But there are tons of world-class match-winners in this team that can help them get over the finish line and into the Champions League final – and Macario is now well-established as being among them.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uswnt-lyon-macario-justify-hype-champions-league-match/bltec7fe5497853a183,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3099,Why reigning champions the Netherlands didn't make it past the Women's Euros quarter-finals,"When the referee blew her final whistle at Rotherham on Saturday night, it signalled the end of the Netherlands’ title defence and their 2022 Women’s Euros, at the early stage of the quarter-finals. France were their conquerors, a side those on the outside might have seen as favourites for this game despite their manager playing down expectations. “The Netherlands are the defending champions,” head coach Corinne Diacre said before the match, which was won 1-0 in extra-time by an Eve Perisset penalty. “If there must be a favourite, it is them. We keep hearing that we can't get past the quarter-finals, so I doubt we'll be favourites.” But those believing the odds were stacked the other way were looking at the present, not the past. For the Netherlands, that has been rocky. Less than a year ago, the Oranje bid farewell to Sarina Wiegman, the coach that led them to the European title in 2017. In came Mark Parsons – a highly successful coach with a great reputation, but one with a totally different style in his first international job. There have been difficult results as this team adapts - a pair of draws with the Czech Republic in their World Cup qualifying among them, as well as a 3-1 defeat to France in February and a 5-1 loss to England just last month. Since the Euros kicked off at the beginning of July, they’ve not had it easy, either. In their opening game with Sweden, they lost captain and first-choice goalkeeper Sari van Veenedaal to injury. After that match, a 1-1 draw that had positives due to the way they grew into it, two of their stand-out performers contracted Covid – Manchester United midfielder Jackie Groenen and Vivianne Miedema, the serial record-breaking forward. Before the knockout stages, winger Lieke Martens, a Champions League winner, would also be sent home due to injury. “It was very tough,” Dominique Janssen, one of those who had to change positions between centre-back and left-back during the tournament due to injuries, admitted. “But in the end, I think it also brought our team closer together. We had to show that togetherness and I think it was important for us to show the character to go through to the next stage, to the quarter-finals. But in the end, it wasn't enough.” That unity was evident in the defeat to France. The team defended admirably for large spells, throwing bodies on the line to keep a clean sheet that would take them to extra time. It was keeping the ball well enough to create their own chances that let them down. This is a star-studded Netherlands side. No matter the transition period under Parsons, no matter the setbacks in this tournament, this is a disappointing exit. There will be questions for Parsons to answer for it. He made a bold call in this quarter-final, with Jill Roord, the Wolfsburg midfielder who changed the game in that opener against Sweden, named on the bench. “We do a deep analysis of everything after this tournament,” he said in his post-match press conference about that decision. “There is no time right now to have any regrets.” Criticisms surrounded the lack of meaningful minutes for the younger players in the squad in the early games, too. In the 4-1 win over Switzerland that sealed the Netherlands' place in the knockout rounds, those future stars showed they are worth the opportunities. That’s one of the huge positives this team can take forward. Daphne van Domselaar, the 22-year-old deputising for Van Veenendaal, has been sensational. “She’s my player of the tournament,” said forward Danielle van de Donk. Romee Leuchter, Victoria Pelova and Esmee Brugts, the latter still only 18 years old, are among the other youngsters to have gained huge experience on the biggest stage this summer – and shone on it, too. “I think it's something that we can definitely build on in the future,” Janssen believes. Fairly assessing their tournament exit is difficult. This is a team going through a period of change and adaptation. It’s a team that has had to deal with a lot since arriving in England in July. It’s a team that had an incredibly tough quarter-final opponent, too. But the lack of chances created and the dramatic extra-time defeat make this, as midfielder Sherida Spitse put it, “a painful night”, no matter the positives. “I think it is a bit of both, really,” Van de Donk said when asked if there’s a feeling this team could do more or if it’s about accepting the transition period. “I hope we can do more than this but we're going through a lot and we had a lot of ups and downs this tournament. I guess it wasn't really ours.” It’ll take some time for that to sink in for a team which was on such a high five years ago. Saturday certainly wasn’t a day for reflection and perspective. But that day will come and there is plenty for Parsons’ Netherlands to build on. There’s also plenty to ponder, too.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-reigning-champions-netherlands-women-s-euros-quarter/blte38ab112b700de75,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

3126,"Wright: If England's run to the Euro 2022 final doesn't change women's football, what are we doing?","Ian Wright has called for England to change how they view women's football and young girls to get the same opportunities as boys after watching the Lionesses' run to the Euro 2022 final. England crushed Sweden 4-0 in the semi-final, booking their spot in the final at Wembley against either Germany or France. Having watched the evolution of the women's game over the last decade, Wright says it's time to give credit to England's current crop of stars while helping grow the game for those that are on their way up. ""Sweden didn’t take advantage of their chances. England’s goal settled them down. Scoring early in the second half felt like there was no way back,"" Wright told the BBC after the match.  ""I’m delighted. I feel they needed to take those chances. We were on the back foot. We rode our luck. We romped away with it because we have quality and a great manager.  ""Millie Bright has been brilliant in every game. Lessi, not Messi, for what she [Russo] has done when she comes on. I don’t know what she has to do to start a game.  ""Whatever happens in the final, if the girls aren't allowed to play football in PE like the boys what are we doing? This will inspire a lot of people. If there’s no legacy after this what are we doing?"" Former England right-back Alex Scott was also full of praise for the team, pointing to the fact numerous players have seized their moment in the spotlight. England's 4-0 win was the largest margin of victory in a Euro semi-final, while Mead, Russo and Fran Kirby have all contributed to five goals each. With a trip to Wembley looming, Scott is excited for what she believes will be a ""special"" day for the women's game in her home country. ""Is this real? Someone pinch me,"" she said. ""England were frustrated in the opener, they blew away Norway, they were on the ropes against Spain and today England found a way back into the game and brushed Sweden aside. We’re off to Wembley. Come on.  ""Every single game you’ve had different players step up. People questioned Rachel Daly, a big performance. Leah Williamson and Millie Bright were rock solid. Great performances from different individuals every game.  ""The amount of investment that has gone into the women’s game. This team to get to Wembley is special, they deserve every accolade.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/wright-england-euro-2022-final-womens-football/bltd18e8a874f5d813a,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3147,‘I know that I'm not alone’ – USWNT star Macario opens up on Lyon's UWCL final against Barcelona,"Lyon striker Catarina Macario says the form she has shown to help the French giants to the Women’s Champions League final is simply what she would “expect” of herself, as the United States women's national team star aims to win the competition for the first time. The 22-year-old signed for the seven-time European champions in January of last year, forgoing her senior season at Stanford to do so, and scored seven times in her first 11 appearances. The Brazil-born forward has gone up another level this campaign though, contributing 21 goals and six assists in all competitions to help OL reach the UWCL final for the tenth time. Speaking to GOAL ahead of Saturday’s final against reigning champions Barcelona, Macario said: “Last season, it was different. It took some time just to transition from college to the professional level, to a new country, a new team and everything. “When you compare the two, it's definitely better this season. But again, at the same time, I feel like this is what I expect of myself. UWCL final stream links 👇 English - https://bit.ly/BarcelonaLyonEN Spanish - https://bit.ly/BarcelonaLyonES French - https://bit.ly/BarcelonaLyonFR ""I know this is what Lyon also expects of me, at least before they signed me. They wanted someone that can make an impact, so I'm glad that I've been able to play my part in that and just be myself and help the team. “I think it really is just due to just me being here for a little bit over a year now. I have much better chemistry now with my team-mates and we've had Sonia [Bompastor, head coach] for a little bit over a year as well. “That definitely helped a lot, the fact that I was actually able to be here from the start [of the season] and not just come in halfway through the season. “I actually feel like I'm just more of a part of the team now. We've gone through pre-season together and so many different things. ""I definitely feel we're in this together, rather than just a random person showing up from college in the middle of the season! “I had a little bit of a, I guess, buffer time. Now, at the start of this season, I was able to just be with everyone and just hit the ground running. “I think it's just due to a variety of different factors but I definitely hope that can keep going into the final, into the end of the season and obviously into next year as well.” Macario and Lyon are on the brink of winning the league title and individual awards may follow for their No.13, with her form already seeing her placed among the nominees for the best player in the French top flight this season. This weekend, she has the chance to become a European champion too, having been one of the stars of the UWCL all year. “Now, I am just focused on my preparation ahead of it. I haven't really thought about it,” she said when asked if she has allowed herself to imagine what it would feel like to lift the trophy. “Obviously, you dream about winning the Champions League, but I feel like that can't happen until you prepare. ""So, we are preparing well so that we can be successful on the day and it's really nice that so many players from Lyon have had the experience of what it's like to win the Champions League final and to win so many of them. “It's very comforting to know that some of my team-mates have been there and have done that before. For me, because it's my first final, it's a big match! “I know that it won't be easy, by any means, and so there are times when experience definitely helps and I'm really happy that I have some team-mates that I can count on to calm me down or just give me more confidence, no matter what's happening on the pitch. “That's one of the things that I absolutely love about football, that I know that I'm not alone. ""I know that I have people that I can count on and that have my back, helping and supporting me when I step out on the pitch.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/dream-winning-champions-league-uswnt-lyon-macario-uwcl-final/blt5e790d21f7360ce3,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3158,Heath scores late to help Arsenal overcome controversial referee-aided goal against Manchester City,"Tobin Heath's stoppage time equaliser for Arsenal against Manchester City on Sunday extended the Gunners' lead at the top of the Women's Super League and offset a controversial, referee-assisted opener for the hosts. City had gone ahead with the referee accidentally involved in the build-up, as a deflection off the official wrong-footed Arsenal and ignited a swift counterattack. The Gunners fumed at that allowed goal, with head coach Jonas Eidevall being booked for his protests. Manchester City went ahead in the 65th minute through Bunny Shaw before Heath supplied the emotional equaliser late on. Controversy as Bunny Shaw opens the scoring!

Afterwards, I totally understand that.  ""For me, that’s also a part of football. I think the referee can also understand why we get very upset."" The head coach also called for higher officiating standards and training in the WSL. ""I think the referees should be given all the resources that they need in order to prepare and practice and work on their fitness and I think that’s where we need to help each other in the football family,"" he said. When asked whether Man City considered letting Arsenal score after the controversial goal, manager Gareth Taylor replied: ""No. Not at all. Why would we? We weren’t convinced it had hit the referee."" While they came away displeased at needing to settle for a draw, the point nonetheless moved Arsenal two points clear of Manchester United at the top of the WSL table.

3161,'Sweet Caroline' - Lyrics & why England fans sing Neil Diamond classic hit,"The Neil Diamond classic hit 'Sweet Caroline' became an unofficial anthem for England fans at Euro 2020 as thousands of supporters sang it at Wembley and it also became the soundtrack to the Lionesses' Euro 2022 campaign. With Diamond's song being sung with such gusto at major tournaments, the American singer has been delighted and even sent well wishes to the Three Lions. England fans already have an impressive catalogue of stadium tracks to sing, including 'Football's Coming Home', World in Motion and Vindaloo, so how exactly did they come to sing Sweet Caroline? GOAL brings you the lyrics of the iconic love song and some background about its association with football. Where it began,I can't begin to knowing,But then I know it's growing strongWas in the spring,Then spring became the summer,Who'd have believe you'd come along? Hands,Touching hands,Reaching out,Touching me,Touching you... Sweet Caroline!Good times never seemed so good.I've been inclinedTo believe they never would But now I...Look at the nightAnd it don't seem so lonely.We filled it up with only two.And when I hurt,Hurting runs off my shoulders,How can I hurt when holding you? One,Touching one,Reaching out,Touching me,Touching you... Sweet Caroline!Good times never seemed so good.I've been inclinedTo believe they never would, oh no, no. Sweet Caroline!Good times never seemed so good.Sweet Caroline!I believed they never could.  Sweet Caroline… #ENG pic.twitter.com/K158bHtfKb While 'Sweet Caroline' is not traditionally associated with the England football team, it has long been used as a celebratory song for a number of English teams and sportspeople. Aston Villa supporters have been singing the song for years, as have Chelsea fans, and it appears that there has been some assimilation among the national team fans. Tony Perry, a DJ at Wembley Stadium, played his part in cementing the song as a terrace anthem when he played it instead of the traditional Fat Les song 'Vindaloo' after England's Euro 2020 semi-final win against Germany. ""When England beat Germany, we'd actually played 'Sweet Caroline' in the pre-match build-up and both sets of fans reacted to it like crazy,"" Perry told BBC Evening Extra. ""At that moment, I thought 'I'm just going to hit 'Sweet Caroline'', because it would do a better job than 'Vindaloo' with the sentiment of coming out of a pandemic and Gareth Southgate laying to rest the ghosts of Euro 96.""  England boss Gareth Southgate is a big fan of the new soundtrack to England's on-field exploits, telling ITV : ""You can't beat a bit of Neil Diamond.  ""It's just a really joyous song, I think, that brings people together."" American singer Neil Diamond wrote and released 'Sweet Caroline' in 1969. A single release, the song's title takes its name from the daughter of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy, though the lyrical theme was inspired by Diamond's wife Marcia. The song peaked at No. 3 in the U.S. charts at the time and only hit No. 8 in the UK charts, but its popularity has endured through the decades. England are by no means unique in football when it comes to singing 'Sweet Caroline' at games, with supporters of Northern Ireland taking exception to the idea that it is a Three Lions song. Irish television presenter Eamonn Holmes jokingly told England to ""get your own song"" on Twitter after Southgate's side defeated Denmark in the semi-final of Euro 2020. #SweetCaroline .....We had it first ! 😁🙂🤣👍 https://t.co/YDr0SZRDvr Northern Ireland fans had actually been singing Neil Diamond's hit since 2005, interestingly after a win over England. As mentioned, Sweet Caroline is also sung on the terraces of Villa Park by Aston Villa fans and Stamford Bridge by Chelsea fans. It has also been used as a walkout song for British heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua, as well as the Major League Baseball team the Boston Red Sox.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/sweet-caroline-lyrics-why-england-fans-sing-neil-diamond-classic-/1g9h6mfgq2cnv1o3471rdtirhr,Ryan Kelly,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3190,Rapinoe welcomes $22m pay discrimination settlement for USWNT after long-running legal fight,"Megan Rapinoe is among those to have welcomed a notable victory for USWNT stars in their legal fight against U.S. Soccer, with a pay discrimination case set to deliver $22 million in back pay for the 28 players that sued the system in 2019. A long-running dispute that has only just been brought to a close stretches all the way back to 2016, when a complaint was filed to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The final settlement agreed in February 2022, which includes a further $2m dedicated to post-playing careers and charitable endeavours and will see equal pay distributed between the men’s and women’s teams in America, will be given final approval once a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) has been agreed between the USWNT Players’ Association and the federation – with the memorandum of understanding that is in place at present set to run through to the end of March. “We’re so happy,” USWNT superstar Rapinoe told The Athletic. “We feel like this is a huge win — obviously contingent upon the ratification of the CBA — but it will have equal pay on everything moving forward. “It’s honestly kind of surreal. I feel like I need to take a step back. We’ve all been in the trenches of it for so long. I think I honestly don’t even understand how monumental this is.” Rapinoe added that “justice” has been done for stars of the present and future, while the 2019 Ballon d’Or Feminin winner has also thanked the efforts of past players – such as 1999 World Cup winner and current president of the United States Soccer Federation, Cindy Cone – for making a historic agreement possible. Rapinoe said: “Thankful for Cindy, who fought really hard to get this done. “Her knowing and experiencing all of this herself, probably worse than we had it, and knowing what a big champion she was of this (settlement), in potentially the face of some opposition.” U.S. Soccer has released a joint-statement with the USWNT on its official website confirming the resolution of an outstanding equal pay dispute which has hung over the game in America for several years. That statement reads: “We are pleased to announce that, contingent on the negotiation of a new collective bargaining agreement, we will have resolved our longstanding dispute over equal pay and proudly stand together in a shared commitment to advancing equality in soccer. “Getting to this day has not been easy. The U.S. Women’s National Team players have achieved unprecedented success while working to achieve equal pay for themselves and future athletes. “Today, we recognize the legacy of the past USWNT leaders who helped to make this day possible, as well as all of the women and girls who will follow. Together, we dedicate this moment to them. “We look forward to continuing to work together to grow women’s soccer and advance opportunities for young girls and women in the United States and across the globe.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rapinoe-22m-pay-discrimination-settlement-uswnt-long-running/blt3bf2ce9346916927,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

The 17-year-old, who has ranked at No.8 in the women’s NXGN 2022 list, made her senior debut with Betis in January 2020, aged just 15. Since then, she has established herself in the first team and is emerging as a real talent at left-back – no surprise given she names Jordi Alba and Roberto Carlos as other idols of hers. In an exclusive interview with GOAL, Medina spoke about her role models both as a child and today. “My father used to show me videos of Roberto Carlos and Ronaldinho,"" she said. ""They are references for me. ""When I was a girl, there were still no female role models in my time, but now little girls do have female role models. “I like Jordi Alba a lot, although people criticise him a lot, but I think he is a very good player, very offensive and defensively very powerful. ""And from the girls. Alexia Putellas, who is a reference point for everyone right now, and for me too because she has achieved what no one has achieved so far and I think that's very good. “I think that Alexia winning the Ballon d'Or is another step forward for Spanish women's football, because whether you like it or not, it means that women's football is more followed and there are more women's players and it's a very big step forward for her and for us. “I think that the time that I have had to live in is a privilege because, for example, [Angela] Sosa or Paulita [Real Betis team-mates] have not had the opportunity that I am having now to fight for women's football. I think that the time that I have had to live in is a privilege and I hope that many more things will be achieved.” Medina also described Simone Biles, the joint-most decorated gymnast of all time, as someone she admires outside of football. “She is a person who has given everything for sport,” the teenager explained. “She is very brave because she left the Olympics due to mental health problems. I think she is a person to be admired.” Speaking about her integration into the first team at such a young age, Medina, who grew up as a Betis fan, recalled the ""nerves"" she had on the week of her debut. “I remember a week before and I already knew that I was going to be called up because Paulita had five yellow cards, so they told me that I would probably be called up,” she remembered. “That whole week was a week of nerves, of uncertainty, because for a 15-year-old girl to go with the first team and to have the chance to make her debut was incredible. I was super nervous. I couldn't put my shin guards on!"" “I think the work I do every day has its own process,” she added, reflecting on her development since becoming a regular in the team. “I consider myself a fast and quick player who puts a lot of courage into the matches. I think that's what characterises me. “There are many aspects to improve day-by-day, because I think it's a constant learning process to be in the first division and to be next to team-mates who know a lot. ""I'm only 17 years old. I still have a lot to learn, so I think I still have a long way to go.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/roberto-carlos-ronaldinho-putellas-nxgn-star-medina-ballon/blt651e23550bd2a741,By Cesar Hurtado,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3201,France have broken quarter-final curse but can controversial coach Diacre lead them to Women's Euros glory?,"France – home of Europe’s most successful club and many of the world’s best players – will compete in a first ever Women's Euros semi-final on Wednesday. It’s remarkable that they’ve never been here before. For years, this country has been plagued by a quarter-final curse, losing its last three in a row in this competition. Last week, that rotten run was finally ended by an extra-time win over the Netherlands.  ""The glass ceiling has finally shattered,” wrote L’Equipe, “scattering thousands of shards of relief.” “As players on the pitch, we never had any doubts,” Player of the Match Selma Bacha told UEFA afterwards. “The team was perfect this evening. The leaders really pushed us forward and we kept believing.” Having overcome what must have been a real mental block, could this finally be France’s time? A look through the squad underlines that they have the requisite talent to win the Euros.  Wendie Renard, the player with the most appearances in the Champions League – a trophy she has won eight times with Lyon – is their captain. In midfield, they have Grace Geyoro, who has been Paris Saint-Germain’s captain since her early 20s and is among the best midfielders in the world.  Ahead of her is a pool of forwards that few other nations can compete with: Kadidiatou Diani and Sandy Baltimore from PSG; Melvine Malard and Delphine Cascarino from Lyon. The team lost Marie-Antoinette Katoto in the group stages, one of the game’s best No.9s suffering a serious knee injury. But even without her, France still probably have the best attack in the tournament. But there are a number of reasons why many are still doubting their ability to go all the way. One of those reasons is the coach, Corinne Diacre. Since taking over five years ago, controversy has been omnipresent. She’s had high-profile fall-outs with some of the leading names in French football – Lyon goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi, who has retired from international duty while Diacre is in charge, went as far as to say: “Winning a title with this coach seems impossible to me.” She has also made incredibly bold and often baffling selections with her squad. After leaving Katoto out of the World Cup in 2019, Amandine Henry was the headline-grabbing omission this summer.  The midfielder was snubbed just a week after her Player of the Match performance in the Champions League final. “It just doesn’t add up,” she told L’Equipe. So far in this tournament, that potential danger of an internal implosion many believe Diacre brings hasn’t occurred.  In fact, those with reservations about this team’s ability to succeed will have felt a little silly after the first round of group games, with France absolutely hammering an Italy team tipped to be dark horses, the final score 5-1. “We’re not the favourites,” Diacre said when asked by GOAL why she felt there had been a lack of title talk about her team going into the summer. “But we’re ambitious and have shown what we are made of this evening.” Since then, though, another old concern has reared its ugly head: France’s inability to score the goals their performances have warranted. They’ve not been clinical and they’ve looked shaky defensively, too.  After a 2-1 win over Belgium and a 1-1 draw with Iceland, they had 33 shots in their quarter-final against the Netherlands. They scored one goal. “If we can take all our chances that would be much better,” said Diacre. “But what matters is creating chances. If you don’t do that, you can’t score.  ""We play on the front foot with great attacking players who create plenty of chances and now we need to be more clinical."" They’ll certainly need to do that on Wednesday in their semi-final clash with Germany.  This is a team yet to concede, a team with one of the world’s best goalkeepers and a defence that is having a sensational tournament. The eight-time champions also have plenty of attacking talent and ways to trouble this France side. Diacre’s side might have overcome that quarter-final hoodoo, but none of the players in her squad – a squad of winners – came to England to reach a semi-final. On the eve of this huge game, Renard was asked what it meant to her to be in the last four. “It will only mean anything if we win the trophy,” she responded. That is the leader of this team, one of the most decorated footballers on the planet, but one who is missing an international trophy. Leading an incredible generation of players, this is one of her best chances – and France’s best chances – to change that.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/france-broken-quarter-final-curse-controversial-coach-diacre/blt9dd3428e76328ed6,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3212,"What is FIFA+? The free football streaming service inspired by Netflix, Disney+ and Prime Video","FIFA+ (or FIFA Plus) has been launched by football's global governing body, with the platform set to deliver free streaming to sports fans around the world. Although the service is similar to Netflix, Prime Video and Disney+, users are being assured that it will be subscription-free in the short to medium term. You will be able to watch live matches and original content on FIFA+, with some of the biggest names in both the men's and women's games set to figure prominently. Here, GOAL brings you everything you need to know about an exciting new venture. Just like Netflix, Prime Video and Disney+, FIFA+ will be available on a mobile app, via a web browser or through an internet-connected TV device. It is free and no subscription is required, but it will have pre-roll and banner advertising to bring in revenue. You can sign in to FIFA+ here. It will not replace local media agreements, which include the TV rights for the FIFA World Cup and Club World Cup. FIFA hope that the platform will help to increase the reach and following around both their showpiece international and club competitions.  𝗪𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵 . 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗺 . 𝗙𝗿𝗲𝗲 Introducing #FIFAPlus: your new home for football ✨ pic.twitter.com/xzhHLFD3cj FIFA+ was launched on April 12, 2022, so it is available to use now.  It can be accessed online via any internet browser - just go to https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/. Alternatively, it can be downloaded for iOS devices through the App Store or Android on Google Play. There will be a host of FIFA+ Originals featuring Ronaldinho, Dani Alves, Ronaldo Nazário, Romelu Lukaku, Lucy Bronze and Carli Lloyd, among others. Upon launch, you will be able to watch: There will also be podcasts, news and gaming content on the platform. Furthermore, there is a 'creator network' to encourage football influencers to sign up and create content directly on the service.  There will be around 40,000 matches a year streamed live, which equates to about 1,500 a month. It is hoped that by the time the World Cup rolls around at the end of 2022, that number will have risen to over 3,000 a month. It will feature men's, women's and youth team matches from across the world. The aim is to broadcast 11,000 women's matches in 65 competitions every year. Approximately half of the member associations have been contacted so far to utilise FIFA+, with all 211 to be spoken with by the end of 2022. The idea is to have a customised homepage for each country that will feature the content most relevant to each audience. FIFA is willing to bring cameras to matches that are currently untelevised, including leagues in Africa, Oceania and Asian territories that are not captured at present. One example that has been mentioned is the Angolan First Division, which does not have local television coverage of its league. Alongside that, there will be content from the bigger football nations. Initially, it is available in English, Spanish, French, German and Portuguese. It will be available in Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Italian, Arabic and Hindu in June 2022. “FIFA+ represents the next step in our vision to make football truly global and inclusive, and it underpins FIFA’s core mission of expanding and developing football globally,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino. “This project represents a cultural shift in the way different types of football fans want to connect with and explore the global game and has been a fundamental part of my Vision 2020-2023. It will accelerate the democratisation of football and we are delighted to share it with fans.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-is-fifa-free-football-streaming-service-inspired/blt6062f36c2ca96bc7,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3229,Alyssa Thompson: USWNT prospect playing alongside the boys to fuel Olympic dream,"Tracey Kevins, the head coach of the U.S. women’s Under-20 national team, remembers vividly the first time she saw Alyssa Thompson play. She was scouting at an event back in 2018 when the director of Thompson’s club in Southern California recommended that she come and watch this bright young talent they had. When he mentioned her birth year, 2004, Kevins was taken aback. “Wow,” she said. “That’s way ahead of the age groups we’re working with at the moment.” “Yes,” he responded. “But I think you need to have a look at her.” What the coach saw was a 13-year-old playing with a team four years older than she was. She saw a player that caught the eye immediately, a “brave” forward that wasn’t afraid to take players on. When you watch Thompson today, you see those same traits, the same electricity that gets you up off your seat. “She's really managed to maintain that, which is hard as you get older and you realise the potential dangers ahead of you,” Kevins tells GOAL. “She's not changed too much. But we've just really seen her flourish over the last couple of years with the different steps that she's taken along her journey.” Those steps have always been challenging, and have been key in allowing Thompson to develop as well as she has. It was three years ago when Mario Gonzalez, director of boys’ club Total Futbol Academy, got a call. Thompson and her younger sister, Gisele, who plays in the U.S. women’s U17 national team, had played for TFA for a short period previously. After playing in girls’ teams for a while, their father wanted a new challenge for them. “Playing with boys at this age, what we thought were going to be challenges ended up being actually strengths for both of them,” Gonzalez explains to GOAL. Alyssa plays in the U19s team that plays in MLS Next, despite still being just 17. She is the only girl in the league. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: “The speed of play is very quick and if you don't pass the ball, the boys are on you,” she tells GOAL. “They give you no time. It's either you get hurt, or you have a good touch and pass it around. “That's definitely something I've learned and taken into the girls’ game as well, which is so helpful, because it's just easier to scan the field.” “Alyssa's personality is very easy-going, it's transcendent, at the point where she is very easy to get along with, very easy to talk to, very friendly,” Gonzalez adds. “Even in the tough games that she's played in against boys, she hasn't been really physically or mentally put down to a point where she broke down in tears or frustration, or just gave up on a play or wanted to get subbed out. “She's very resilient. Again, it's just one of the traits that she has. Her personality allows her to just kind of play through things.” It has allowed her to soar, too. Thompson was the second-youngest player on the roster for the U.S. in their U20 CONCACAF Championship triumph, only older than NWSL record-breaker Olivia Moultrie. At high school, Thompson scored 48 goals in 18 games last year as Harvard-Westlake went undefeated, form that saw her named the Gatorade National Girls’ Soccer Player of the Year. Next year, she will head to Stanford, a program that has produced four of the last five No.1 picks in the NWSL Draft. She has even signed a deal with Nike, along with Gisele, making them the first high-school athletes to a sign a name, image and likeness deal with the sports brand. And she has done all that while still excelling in track and field and getting top grades. “The best compliment I can give her is that if I didn't know that she'd signed [the Nike deal], I wouldn't know,” Kevins says. “She doesn't change. She's a very humble kid. She comes from a very good family who have strong values in terms of what they value - and it's for her to be a well-rounded, good person.” Part of the reason why Thompson keeps her feet on the ground amid all the plaudits is because she has big aims, too. “I just have to keep my head down and keep working and the accolades and stuff like that will come,” she says. “I think it's just something that adds to my journey. It's not like the be all, end all for me. It's amazing, but also, I still have work to do.” “She's what you would call a coach's dream,” Gonzalez explains. “To have a quality player, with a quality personality, very open-minded to being coached. “She takes coaching points well, she's willing to try different things in terms of her approach to either finishing or crossing or defending. I think she's developed and the best part about it is I think she has so much more room to grow.” “I, for sure, want to develop my finishing, and my variation of crosses, because I'm a winger,” Thompson says. “Also, I could play as a No.9 sometimes so, if I have one chance, being able to finish that one chance, not needing extra.” Alongside that development, the teenager’s aims right now are on having a strong U20 World Cup as the U.S. try to win it for the first time since 2012. She would also like a chance to train with the senior team. What about long-term? The California native only needs a second to think. “Definitely winning the Olympics in 2028, because it's in Los Angeles,” she replies. “I hope me and my sister can be on the team together and win it together. That would be really cool.” It’s quite the dream to have at 17 years old, but when you have the talent and desire that Thompson has, you can dream big. “The mental approach she has, I think it's phenomenal for her age,” Gonzalez says, signing off on a perfect note. “The fact that she's able to endure all this at this age, it just goes to show that I think she's on the right track for whatever comes next.” For more on the world's best young ballers, follow NXGN on Instagram, Twitter and TikTok.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/alyssa-thompson-uswnt-prospect-fuel-olympic-dream/blt5a9779ffd5828402,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3264,USWNT & Arsenal star Heath 'loves' London & says it must be like how Thierry Henry felt going to New York,"Arsenal star Tobin Heath believes she understands how Thierry Henry must have felt following his transfer to the New York Red Bulls. As a USWNT standout, Heath is used to being recognised by fans back from her days playing for Oregon side Portland Thorns, but since she made the switch to England, things have changed. Having joined the London club from Manchester United last year, the 33-year-old has found she is rather anonymous among the crowds of the big city. Just as Gunners hero Henry was a well-known face for Londoners, he was not a famous face when he initially landed in New York from Barcelona in 2010 and Heath reckons the pair have gone through similar experiences in that regard. Heath told The Times: ""Going to a massive global city, it was probably like the way that [Thierry] Henry must have felt when he came to New York and could just ride around in the subways and not be bothered, because nobody knew who he was.. “That’s the way I feel here. I love it, because I honestly don’t get stopped ever. It’s actually really nice. For someone like me, I’m pretty shy. It’s a little uncomfortable for me. I actually love being in London for that reason.” Former Paris Saint-Germain star Heath has claimed many accolades throughout her career, but is yet to win the Champions League so far. Arsenal are still in the frame to lift the title this season as they are set to face Wolfsburg in the quarter-finals, with the home leg taking place at the Emirates Stadium. Heath is excited to return to the stadium, and believes playing on such a can give a huge boost to the women's game. “I think it’s incredible,"" she added. ""For these massive clubs like Arsenal playing at the Emirates is fantastic and for Barcelona playing in the Camp Nou to a sell-out is fantastic. “The opportunity that’s there for the growth of women’s football is huge but it just shows that when the big clubs want to get behind their women’s team, there’s massive rewards for it and there’s massive engagement.” She added: “The quality is just insane and having this opportunity to play in the Champions League with this squad, was something that was important to my decision [to join], for sure.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uswnt-and-arsenal-star-heath-loves-london-and-says-it-must/bltc84892690e685ea5,By Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3268,'Liverpool duo Salah & Mane an inspiration to African youth' - Chelsea keeper Mendy during World Economic Forum speech,"Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy has lauded the impact that Liverpool duo Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane have on young people in Africa with their successful football careers. Salah and Mane have become global superstars due to their goalscoring exploits for Jurgen Klopp’s men and Mendy feels they are true examples and role models to African youth as they give them hope and desire to achieve their goals. “When you see African players, people like Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane, who really play at the highest possible level, then we talk about the best world players not just the best African players and I think this is what we need to focus on,” said Mendy, while speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “They are true examples, role models and give hope to young people, making them desire to work and exceed the limits to achieve one goal. This is how football has impacted on social level in all countries around the world."" Mendy was among key speakers on the topic, Sports as a Unifying Force, and was joined on the panel by Fifa president Gianni Infantino, his Caf counterpart Patrice Motsepe, former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, legendary Brazil striker Ronaldo and San Diego Wave FC boss Jill Ellis. The Senegal stopper also shared how football has been a unifying factor not just in Africa but around the world. “Football is a sport which brings together more people than at any given time than any other sport. It has the power to transmit and instill values in young people. They see us as an example, as role models,” added Mendy. Mendy, voted the world’s top goalkeeper in 2020-21, has had a satisfactory season for club and country, helping Senegal to a maiden Africa Cup of Nations title in February where he was crowned the tournament’s best custodian. He was also key in Chelsea winning the Uefa Super Cup at the start of the season as well as the Fifa Club World Cup in December, but further silverware eluded him after the Blues were beaten by Liverpool on post-match penalties in both the Carabao and FA Cup finals. Mendy finished the season fourth in the Premier League Golden Glove race after keeping 14 clean sheets, one behind Tottenham Hotspur’s Hugo Lloris, with Manchester City’s Ederson and Liverpool’s Alisson sharing the award after managing 20 each.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-salah-mane-inspirationafrican-chelsea-keeper-mendy/bltfdef55c62001a79d,Joel Omotto,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3303,From Madrid's Barcelona blueprint to clinical Katoto: What we learned from the Women's Champions League,"The Women’s Champions League returned this week, with the first legs of four intriguing quarter-final ties taking place. El Clasico was the most eye-catching draw, such is the history of the rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid on the men’s side – even if the latter’s women’s team is new to the scene. Seven-time European champions faced Juventus, who had never ventured this far in continental competition, while games between Bayern Munich and PSG, and Arsenal and Wolfsburg, were extremely tough to call. Here is what we learned from the latest round of European action... When Real Madrid took the lead against Barcelona on Tuesday evening, it was a surprise, but it was also extremely well deserved. There were only eight minutes on the clock when Olga Carmona rifled home the first goal of El Clasico, but the hosts had pressed and harried the reigning champions since the first whistle, forcing them to make mistakes and give an opponent a rare advantage. Barca did emerge victorious in the end, a controversial penalty settling them down before they scored twice more through Claudia Pina and Alexia Putellas. ORGULLO.ESFUERZO.SACRIFICIO.TRABAJO. pic.twitter.com/vnsWO25RZr But the Catalans were uncomfortable with the way Real didn’t give them the time they require to dominate at their own pace. It’s something that will have interested a lot of managers in Spain and Europe, as so many try to figure out how to beat this all-conquering team. It’s been three years since Paris Saint-Germain star Marie-Antoinette Katoto established herself as a serious goalscorer, but it feels like she still isn’t given the plaudits she deserves. At the age of 21, she outscored everyone in the French league, which was some feat considering how dominant their big rivals, Lyon, have been both domestically and on the continent. The following season, she did it again. BAYERN VS PSG ACT I ♥️💙 pic.twitter.com/KE9tB2Uq4T Last year, her 21 goals didn’t give her the topscorer accolade, but they did give PSG its first ever league title on the women’s side. On Tuesday, Katoto’s predatory instincts allowed the French club to leave Munich with an advantage, with the striker's double securing a 2-1 victory over Bayern. With 137 goals for the club now at just 23 years old, this is one of the very best players in the world. She deserves to be recognised as such more often. When Wolfsburg set up for their game with Hoffenheim last weekend, Lena Lattwein moved from a defensive midfield role into a more advanced position. She scored twice and was the best player on the pitch as the Frauen-Bundesliga leaders won 3-0. On Wednesday, head coach Tommy Stroot rejigged the team again for the clash with Arsenal, with Alex Popp moving from holding midfield to the left wing. For some teams, this chopping and changing of positions would impact their ability to be a cohesive unit. For Wolfsburg, with the quality of options they have, it just makes them more fluid, more unpredictable and more dangerous. This level of versatility could trouble any side. Juventus’ clash with Lyon was a game that saw a recently risen power against an established force – first time quarter-finalists against seven-time queens of Europe. In the end, with Juve 2-1 winners after an incredibly significant illustration of their development, the result served as a great example of how power is shifting on the continent. While teams like Lyon and Wolfsburg remain at the top, where they have been for the last 10 years, sides such as Juventus and Real Madrid are coming through and making names for themselves now, too. For some, that’s a miserable thought, as the smaller clubs with less resource are phased out by super-clubs. However, it does make for interesting unpredictability across the board for the next few years of the women’s game, with teams in these latter rounds today that didn’t even exist five years ago.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/real-madrid-tactics-katoto-goal-scoring-women-champions/bltdf8d355b749262b4,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3319,'Rapinoe was the clown of the team' - Marozsan reveals experiences of playing alongside USWNT star,"Megan Rapinoe has dedicated her career to the pursuit of on-field perfection, but the World Cup winner does have a lighter side and Germany international Dzsenifer Marozsan says the USWNT star is a “clown of the team” at OL Reign. The United States midfielder, who has 187 caps to her name, has graced the very top of the game, collecting the Ballon d’Or Feminin and FIFA Best Women’s Player award along the way, with relentless drive allowing her to achieve legend status. Life is not all work and no play for Rapinoe, though, with Marozsan – who spent time playing alongside the 36-year-old while taking in a Seattle-based loan spell in 2021 – revealing that Rapinoe is the perfect team-mate. Marozsan told GOAL and SPOX of playing with the two-time World Cup winner: “She is a great person, great on a human level and very funny. “She has a huge character, but is also a bit like the clown of the team.” Getting the chance to grace the same club side as stars such as Rapinoe was an opportunity that Marozsan could not pass up, with the 29-year-old enjoying her spell in America before returning to France at Lyon. Of her experiences Stateside, a midfielder that has taken in 109 appearances for her country, said: “Everything was at an absolutely top level. “It would certainly be very interesting to play with OL Reign against a top European club. Personally, I would say that you would have the level to keep up with top European clubs."" She added on life in Washington: “I had an apartment in beautiful Gig Harbor, about 15 minutes by car from Tacoma. It's incredibly idyllic there. “The place is in Puget Sound, a roughly 150-kilometre-long, island-rich, fjord-like bay in north west Washington. I have to say, it's a really nice part of the world.” While Marozsan thoroughly enjoyed her time in the U.S., it was during her stint with OL Reign that the NWSL was rocked by allegations of sexual coercion and verbal abuse against experienced coach Paul Riley. Fixtures were shut down at one stage, as an investigation was opened, with everyone connected with the game in America pulling together at a challenging time. Marozsan said: “Of course, this news was shocking for me too and difficult for the entire league to process. “But I found it remarkable how all the teams in the league tackled it. Everyone banded together like a big family and held the culprits accountable and the allegations were resolved. That deserves a lot of respect. “I really hope that something like this never happens again in the future. This scandal certainly put the sport in the USA in a bad light. “All players in this league should feel safe and go about it without fear and be able to do what they love!”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rapinoe-clown-of-team-marozsan-experiences-uswnt-star/bltb518084f4ccda254,GOAL,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3323,Celebrating Oshoala: Barcelona’s Pichichi winner targeting successive Champions League wins,"When Asisat Oshoala was introduced in Barcelona Femeni’s final game of the season against Atletico Madrid, she likely had her mind elsewhere as well as on proceedings at Estadi Johan Cruyff. The Nigerian had scored 20 goals in the Liga Iberdrola and was locked in a battle with Madrid CFF’s Geyse Ferreira who had netted the same tally. Ferreira started Madrid’s final game against Sporting de Huelva and had a head start on the Super Falcon who may have hoped for a starting berth on the final day. Admittedly Atletico went into the final game week in third, occupying the final Champions League qualification spot and threatened to put paid to Barcelona’s unblemished league run. Be that as it may, you sense Oshoala may have retained a tinge of disappointment when she was not part of Jonatan Giraldez’s XI. The forward had scored against the same opponents in the reverse fixture in October, a 3-0 win for the Blaugranes, scoring a 35th-minute goal that opened up the game for a further pair of goals. As it turned out, those 27 minutes did not affect the Falcon’s hunt for personal glory. She became the first Nigerian to claim the honour and continued Barca’s streak of claiming the award for the third season running, following Jennifer Hermoso’s three-year winning run of finishing top scorer, claiming two representing the Blaugranes. Twenty goals are undeniably the lowest return since records became available but Oshoala’s return comes with the added context that she was not always first-choice at centre-forward and also had her season hampered by injury, missing eight weeks this term. The former Arsenal forward’s haul came in 19 league appearances, averaging a goal every 0.95 games, a splendid return by anyone’s standards. “It's obviously been a team effort to get here, and l can only thank my team-mates and everyone at the club for this achievement,” the 27-year-old told BBC Sport Africa. “We've been working hard all season and cannot stop now because we have another big one ahead of us. “The focus of everyone has shifted from a league title celebration to preparing for a massive game in Turin.” Indeed, Barcelona are seeking another European triumph after last year’s dismantling of Emma Hayes’ Chelsea. The Spanish giants’ 4-0 success last year was the club’s first and the nation’s maiden triumph in the competition. When they take to the field on Saturday to face off with seven-time winners Olympique Lyonnais Feminin, Oshoala and her teammates seek to become the fourth club to successfully defend their title, a feat previously achieved by Umea, Lyon and Wolfsburg. The encounter in Turin is a repeat of the 2019 final where the French side raced into a four-goal lead inside the opening half-hour to put paid to the Spanish outfit’s dream in their first final.  The Four-time African Women's Footballer of the Year — on loan from Arsenal at the time — netted a late consolation for Barca Femeni, latching onto a through-ball to reduce the deficit but it was unsurprisingly too little too late. The Spanish side have undoubtedly grown since that final in Budapest and will back themselves to get their revenge against the French giants in Turin. Oshoala has been a peripheral figure in the irrepressible side’s run to Saturday’s rematch, scoring only once for Giraldez’s side en route to another final and a third in four years.

3342,Arteta signs new contract to stay as Arsenal manager until 2025,"Arsenal men's manager Mikel Arteta has signed a new contract, agreeing terms with the club until the end of the 2024-25 season. Arteta took over as Gunners boss at the end of 2019 and has helped the club return into contention to finish in the Premier League top four and qualify for the Champions League. Arsenal announced a double managerial deal on Friday morning, with women's boss Jonas Eidevall also agreeing a new contract. Arteta told the Arsenal club website: “I’m excited, grateful and really, really happy today. ""When I spoke to Josh [Kroenke] he could see the club at the same point and he wanted to take the club the way I wanted to do it. So everything that he’s said, and that Stan [Kroenke] has said when I’ve been together with both of them, they’ve always delivered. “We want to take the club to the next level and to compete really with the top teams. In order to do that, we have to be playing in the Champions League. ""We have to be able to evolve the team, improve our players, improve all departments, generate even more connection with our fans, improve the atmosphere at the Emirates, be able to recruit top, top talent and the best people for this club to drive this project to that level.” Eidevall, who has Arsenal in contention for the Women's Super League title heading into the final weekend, has signed a contract to the end of the 2023-24 season. “It’s great,” he said. “It allows me to continue to work for a club that I love so much and be around people that I really, really like, and to be able to achieve things together, so I’m really looking forward to that.” The Spaniard was appointed by Arsenal on December 22, 2019 following the failed reign of Unai Emery, taking his first job in senior management. While it was a risky decision by the Gunners to give their head coach role to a newcomer, Arteta has largely impressed in the dugout at Emirates Stadium. He guided Arsenal to the FA Cup at the end of the 2019-20 season, beating Chelsea to win a trophy in the coronavirus-interrupted season. Arteta, meanwhile, has Arsenal in contention to qualify for the Champions League in 2022-23 - a competition they have not played in since 2017. Arsenal are fourth in the Premier League with four matches to play, two points ahead of rivals Tottenham. Arteta has also revamped the playing squad and culture at Arsenal, allowing senior players such as Mesut Ozil and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to leave, while promoting young talent like Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe into leading roles.

3370,'We got it wrong' - Raith Rovers to release ruled-as-rapist Goodwillie after women's team captain quits club,"Raith Rovers are preparing to release David Goodwillie after his arrival at the club sparked a furious backlash, with the Scottish Championship outfit admitting that they ""got it wrong"".  Goodwillie, 32, was ruled to have committed rape by a civil court judge in 2017 and ordered, along with a team-mate, to pay £100,000 in damages.  Rovers' signing of the player prompted heavy criticism, as well as the resignation of the club's women's captain.  ""As announced on our website last night, Raith Rovers FC can confirm that we have signed David Goodwillie from Clyde FC,"" the club stated on their official website on Tuesday. ""David is a proven goal scorer, and this will be his second stint with the club, having previously played for us on loan from Dundee United during season 2007-08. ""As with all new signings, the club has carefully considered our position as a Community Club and we completely respect the differing views among fans and stakeholders, many of whom we have spoken to directly in the past 24 hours and are continuing to engage with. ""As David has previously played for Raith Rovers earlier in his career, we consider him to be part of Raith Rovers Football Club. The management team is familiar with David’s career and background and – in particular – his footballing ability. That is our foremost consideration, and we believe that he will strengthen the Raith Rovers playing squad. ""Please be assured that as a community football club we fully acknowledge this signing has divided opinion amongst our loyal fans and commercial stakeholders; We aim to rebuild that trust. ""While acknowledging the gravity of what happened ten years ago, as a club we fully support and encourage rehabilitation, and many factors influenced our signing. ""First and foremost, this was a football related decision."" After listening to supporters, Raith chairman John Sim has said in a statement on the club's official website: ""I firstly want to apologise wholeheartedly to our fans, sponsors, players and the wider Raith Rovers community for the anguish and anger caused over the past few days. ""We got it wrong. ""In reaching our original decision, we focused far too much on football matters and not enough on what this decision would mean for our club and the community as a whole. ""Over the past couple of days, we listened carefully to the fans who have got in touch and I’m very grateful for their honesty. As chairman, as a board and as a management team, we have all learned a hard but valuable lesson. ""This very unfortunate episode is something that we all bitterly regret and we are now wholly committed to making things right. I can therefore confirm that, following a meeting of the Raith Rovers board, the player will not be selected by Raith Rovers and we will enter into discussions with the player regarding his contractual position. ""We share a desire to do what is best for our club and will be doing everything in our power to regain the trust and confidence of the Raith Rovers family."" Goodwillie and fellow footballer David Robertson were sued for damages for rape in 2017 by Denise Clair, in one of the first such civil cases to be held in Scotland.  The pair had previously stood accused of criminal charges, but authorities at the time declined to proceed with a prosecution.  In the civil case, however, a judge upheld Clair's claim, ruling that she had been raped in 2011 and ordering Goodwillie and Robertson to pay damages.  After the case Goodwillie parted ways with Plymouth Argyle in League Two and moved to Clyde, whom he represented prior to signing for Raith Rovers.  In response, Raith's women’s captain, Tyler Rattray, revealed: “After 10 long years playing for Raith, it’s gutting I have given up now because they have signed someone like this and I want nothing to do with it!”  Club director Bill Clark joined Rattray in leaving, while the move was also condemned by Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and ex-Primer Minister Gordon Brown, a lifelong Raith fan. Famous crime writer Val McDermid also announced that she would no longer support her childhood club in protest at the transfer, firing on Twitter: ""I have cancelled next season’s shirt sponsorship over this disgusting and despicable move.""

3421,USWNT's Andonovski after lackluster win over Mexico: 'We're not ready for a World Cup right now',"The U.S. women's national team, predictably, finished atop their group at the CONCACAF W Championship thanks to a win over Mexico. But that win on Monday certainly didn't come easy as the U.S. needed every last moment to ultimately break Mexico's hearts. Kristie Mewis scored an 89th-minute winner to lead the U.S. to a 1-0 win on Monday as Vlatko Andonovski's team made it three wins from three at the CONCACAF W Championship.  That goal ended Mexico's hopes of even earning a single point on home soil, but Andonovski says the U.S. still has a long way to go if they hope to make waves at the World Cup next year. Having won their first two games against Haiti and Jamaica by a combined 8-0 scoreline, the U.S. had already booked their spot at the 2023 World Cup and opted for a heavily-rotated lineup on Monday night. And so it was slightly excusable that they came out a bit flat against a Mexico team that knew it needed a win to keep their own World Cup hopes alive. The first half of the match was largely tepid, with Midge Purce coming closest as her shot hit the bar, but the pendulum swung into the USWNT's favour in the 73rd minute when Libeth Ovalle was sent off with a straight red card for a dangerous tackle. Still, Mexico had hopes of a miracle on home soil, only to see those hopes dashed by Mewis late on. Scoring in the 89th minute to secure victory and your vote… @KristieMewie is YOUR @budweiserusa Woman of the Match 🍻 pic.twitter.com/HnAEbiteA2 The midfielder scored her seventh international goal, and it was a sloppy one, as Emily Sonnett's header was cleared off the line only for Mewis to bundle the ball home. In the end, the U.S. made it three games in a row without conceding, while Mexico were held scoreless throughout their tournament run. Goal by @KristieMewie! 🇺🇸  1-0 for @USWNT#CWC pic.twitter.com/YnNi7KxyoP ""I have to say, if you ask me if we're ready to go in a World Cup and compete in the World Cup tomorrow, we're probably not ready for it,"" he said. ""But are we going to be ready in a year? Absolutely.  ""I'm very happy with the progress of the team, the development of the team and the development of the individuals within the team as well. I think that we're doing a good job and we're moving in the right direction."" Andonovski was also quick to praise Mexico after the match, adding: ""Sometimes it's not just us. Sometimes it's how much the opponent gives you or allows you to be creative or to make things happen.  ""I want to give credit to Mexico. I thought they were very motivated. They were fighting. I wouldn't say that they were better than us, but they were definitely making it very hard for us... I was coaching a big part of the game was smile on my face because, to some degree, we want we wanted to see that."" With the win, the U.S. will now face Costa Rica in the semi-final round of the CONCACAF W Championship, with Canada facing Jamaica on the other side of the bracket. The winners of those games will meet in the tournament final, with the winner earning a spot in the Olympics while the loser will head to the Olympic playoff against the third-place team.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lackluster-uswnt-benefit-from-last-gasp-mewis-winner-as/bltabdd9c8dfaef7012,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3425,From trialists in flip-flops to five titles in a row: How Juventus changed women's football in Italy,"Just three girls turned up for Juventus' first open day in 2015 – and one of those was wearing a pair of flip flops. Fast forward seven years and Juventus is the most dominant side in Italian women’s football.  The first team formed in 2017, two years after the federation made it mandatory for clubs in Serie A to have female academies, and has won all five league titles it has competed for.  The Bianconere have also lifted two Coppa Italia trophies and claimed the Supercoppa Italiana on three occasions. This past season, Joe Montemurro masterminded a domestic treble, as well as leading Juve to the last eight of the Champions League – both historic firsts. But it’s not just the present that looks good. A few more populous open days later and Juventus' academy is arguably the best in the country. In fact, when Italy takes part in the UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship in June, no club will be better represented. In qualifying, 21 of the team’s 26 goals were scored by those coming through the system in Turin. Stefano Braghin, head of Juventus Women, laughs when he recalls that first open day with just three attendees but is quick to point out that it was a landmark occasion nonetheless.  ""It all started from there and now we have more or less 200 young players, in nine teams from Under-9s to Under-19s,"" he tells GOAL.  ""All the categories are in some way covered. That means a lot after just seven years.” 𝙔𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙣𝙨 🏆🥇 pic.twitter.com/u3ZEmUwf5l Juve's rapid rise to prominence is made all the more impressive by the fact that Piedmont, where Turin sits, is not an easy region in which to recruit players. Furthermore, attitudes towards the women's game within Italy have only started to shift very recently. The number of girls playing the game is extremely low as a result, particularly in comparison to other countries. “In the younger categories, we still need to make quantity,” says Braghin, who spent six years running the men’s academy before switching to Juve's women’s side in 2018.  “We cannot waste players, at least not at the very beginning of their pathway. So, from [age] nine to 12 or 13, we really try to recruit everyone who is keen to play in the club. “But, on the other hand, starting from 14 years old, what we would like to do is to raise the quality of the groups, and we started last season having some relationships with local teams. Maybe the players that are not good enough for Juventus might be good for them. “Here, we try to have very limited groups with quality as high as possible. This is the idea because now we start competing at quite a high level with the first team.” To raise that quality, Juventus has had to get creative. “Usually, our teams, especially in the regional competitions, win 20-0,” Braghin says.  “So, what we did is, the under-15s play the under-17 championship, and the under-17s play the men's under-15s championship. Our under-16s group is currently playing a men's competition, too.” Can you see the impact?  “100 per cent,” Juve’s head of women’s football replies before GOAL can even finish the question, “especially in terms of intensity and strength. ""But the biggest thing I've noticed is that you can play quicker and you have to take decisions quicker because of the pressure that you're not used to.” The end product is some of the most exciting talents in Italian women’s football. Alice Giai, Alice Berti, Elisa Pfattner, Nicole Arcangeli and Chiara Beccari are among the teenagers to keep an eye on, all making their senior debuts in the last two seasons. “The player that has made the most appearances in Juventus is Arianna Caruso, who is 22 years old,” Braghin adds. “She started playing here at 17. We are never afraid to give the chance to the young players. “The first game of the [2021-22] Champions League against Servette in Geneva, we had eight players under 23 on the pitch. For a very new team, it's not bad.” With Juventus driving Italian women’s football forward, these numbers will only get bigger and better. After the Bianconere’s establishment of a women’s team in 2017, giants like Roma, Inter and Milan have all followed suit. That’s improving the quality of Serie A and also the national team, which reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup in 2019.  That was pivotal in the progress of the game in Italy not only at the highest level, but lower down, too, resulting in a noticeable increase in girls playing football. “The numbers are growing very fast, to be honest,” Braghin notes. “Now, we have to be good as a system to keep the standards high and let them grow very fast as players.” A hat-trick of Bianconere scorers in Beccari ⚽️, Pfattner ⚽️ & Arcangeli ⚽️ as Italy  triumph against Hungary in the Euro U19 Women qualifier! 🇮🇹💪Well done, girls! 👏 pic.twitter.com/WKRvADwYoA Professionalism in women’s football will be introduced next season in Italy, which Braghin hopes will overcome natural challenges to bring “sustainability” as well as further “development”.  That will come after the national team has another chance to capture the attention of a nation at this summer’s Women’s Euros. There are still things that need to improve across the board and obstacles that are not so quick or easy to conquer. Braghin highlights the importance of coaches to be “formed mentally and technically for coaching girls”, which is rare in Italy because “you don't really have a generation of women's coaches”.  Juventus, as a club, has aims and ambitions to expand the facilities and opportunities it gives the young girls coming through the club, too. But if the first seven years are anything to go by, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic not only in Turin, but across the whole country, as the Bianconere continue to set the standard for the rest of Italy to follow. “This is a football country at the end of the day,” Braghin adds. “When you offer something good and something that people can rely on, I think it's not difficult in Italy to have people playing football.  ""What they missed was the right situation to do that. This is a very Catholic, old-style country so consider that maybe the prejudice against women's football was still very strong. “Playing football in an environment [such as Juventus], in such a club, probably removes most of the prejudice of the people – then, the numbers go up very fast.” Nothing illustrates that quite like going from three girls at an open day to 200 in an academy as quickly as Juventus have.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/italy-dominant-force-juventus-women-football/blt1c69edcce8dce987,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

The Lionesses fought their way to glory on Sunday at the expense of Germany, sealing a 2-1 win after extra time. It is the nation's first trophy in the women's game while also breaking a senior drought which stretches back to 1966. “The world around us will be changed,” Wiegman told reporters after the game. “It’s positive but we have to be aware of it too. But we’ve changed society. That’s what we want. It’s so much more than football. We want to win, but through football you can make little changes in society and that’s what we hoped for. “This has done so much for the game and for women and society. In England, but also across the world. It’s so nice to see how enthusiastic everyone was, inside and outside the stadium."" Sunday's victory makes England one of five teams to have lifted the Women's European Championship, and Wiegman is aware that the pressure to succeed will only grow with this success. ""Now we won the Euros the expectation will go up again. First we will party. We are really proud,"" she added. ""The development of this game has gone so fast, so many countries could win this tournament. We have all seen that. It’s not easy to win this tournament and next year that will be too.

3482,USWNT miss out on Egurrola as Lyon star pledges allegiance to Netherlands,"The United States women's national team have missed out on the services of Damaris Egurrola as the Lyon star has now pledged her international allegiance to Netherlands instead. Egurrola, who joined Lyon from Everton in January 2021, is eligible to play for three different countries at international level, having been born in the U.S to a Spanish father and Dutch mother. The 22-year-old won her only senior cap to date for Spain in 2019 and reportedly held talks with U.S Soccer about representing the USWNT, but has now chosen to play for Netherlands. Egurrola explained her decision after being called up to the Netherlands squad for a World Cup qualifying fixture against Cyprus and a friendly clash with South Africa next month. “I am extremely happy to be able to represent the Netherlands,"" said the midfielder. ""It’s quite special to be born with a Spanish dad, a Dutch mom, and in the USA! ""I have always felt close with the Netherlands, where I spent all my summers, and where I started playing football with my cousins.  ""I feel I inherited both Dutch and Spanish culture in my childhood. Representing the Netherlands is a tribute to my mother, and I can’t wait to wear that jersey in a few days.  ""Groningen is where all my Dutch family is based, it couldn’t be better!” Egurrola began her career at Athletic Club back in 2015 and spent five years on their books, during which time she represented Spain at youth level. She won the U17 European Championships in 2017 and also played for the U17s and U20s before making her debut for the Spanish senior team in a 4-0 friendly against Cameroon in May 2019, but wasn't called up again afterwards. Everton snapped Egurrola up on a two-year contract after her departure from Athletic Club in September 2020, and she impressed in her first few months on Merseyside, attracting the attention of Lyon in the process. The French outfit triggered her buy-out clause in the 2021 winter transfer window and she has since played 23 games for the club, scoring three goals.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uswnt-miss-out-on-egurrola-as-lyon-star-pledges-allegiance/blt8d431449dae70d7c,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

3572,Angel City owner and actress Portman opens up on desire to shift soccer culture,"Angel City FC owner Natalie Portman says that she hopes the club can help achieve a dream to ""shift culture"" among the women's game to draw it level with men's football around the world. The NWSL expansion side, owned by a group headed in part by the Academy Award-winning actress alongside several other Hollywood and sporting stalwarts, are hoping to leave their mark in their maiden season. Ahead of their curtain-raising campaign, Portman now has outlined how she came to be involved - and what she hopes the club can deliver. ""[I watched] my son idolize players like Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan the same way he did Lionel Messi or Karim Benzema,"" Portman told the Guardian. ""[It made me realise] that amplifying female athletes could rapidly shift culture. “Our dream is to make women’s soccer as valued as male soccer is throughout the world."" The expansion club will begin their new era when they play their maiden match against San Diego Wave FC in this weekend's NWSL Challenge Cup. They make up the West Division alongside the Wave, plus OL Reign and Portland Thorns, who are the defending champions. Angel City will then kick off their regular season slate against North Carolina Courage on April 29, at Banc of California Stadium, unless one of the two makes it to the Challenge Cup final.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/angel-city-owner-and-actress-portman-opens-up-on-desire-to-shift-/blt5366ade6d68c7b4c,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3582,'Get in the bin' - Lionesses star England calls out Souness for comments following Chelsea and Tottenham brawl,"Graeme Souness alluded to football as a ""man's game"" after a fiery London derby between rivals Chelsea and Tottenham. Thomas Tuchel and Antonio Conte squared off more than once, resulting in both of them receiving a red card and a clash between coaching staff and players at full-time. Sky Sports pundit Souness said: ""It's a mans game all of a sudden again."" At the time he was sat next to former England international Karen Carney who looked a bit perplexed following the comment. The England Women's team recently lifted the European Championships ending a 56-year wait for international glory at senior-level for the country. The Lionesses beat Germany 2-1 in extra time thanks to Chloe Kelly who scored to end the heartbreak of so many previous tournaments.

3583,'A new era' - Barcelona & Madrid's historic Camp Nou Clasico proves anything is now possible for women's game,"Barcelona 5-2 Real Madrid: Match Statistics Alexia Putellas, captain of Barcelona women’s team and a childhood fan of the club, said this week that she never dreamed about playing at Camp Nou. What sort of expectations can you have of something, if you have never dared to imagine it? One doesn’t know – but whatever images Putellas might have pictured in her head going into Wednesday’s sold-out Champions League quarter-final clash with Real Madrid at Camp Nou –  it’s sure that the reality surpassed all expectations. Indeed, when the teams were read out before kick-off, the name of the 2021 Ballon d’Or winner was met with a deafening roar by a record-breaking crowd for a women's game of 91,553 fans. Fittingly, Barca marked this historic occasion with a thrilling 5-2 victory to progress 8-3 on aggregate to the semi-finals of the UWCL, which they won so emphatically last year. Putellas scored the hosts' fourth goal on the night, her shot trickling over the line, and she bowed to the Camp Nou crowd before blowing them a kiss. ‘Alexia! Alexia! Alexia!’ rang out around the ground.  There is always a danger in women’s football that when games are given such a big billing, they can fall short of expectations. To try to get a historic attendance, tickets are sold for cheaper prices, or given away for free in some cases, and so some don’t mind giving the game a miss if the weather is bad or something else comes up. 91,553.A world record for a women's football match 👏 pic.twitter.com/kGzr9x7NhW When rain poured down on the city of Barcelona on the morning of the game, some feared the worst – but the grey clouds would fade away and the fans filled up the bars around the stadium before the big event, renditions of ‘Allez, Allez, Allez’ heard from all directions. Even after the 6:45pm kick-off local time, the streets around the Camp Nou continued to be packed with fans hurrying inside after rushing to get to the stadium, hoping to miss as little of the action as possible. Many will have missed the first two goals of this crazy game, though, with Mapi Leon opening the scoring for the hosts on eight minutes, before Olga Carmona equalised after 16. However, once they made it inside, they were treated to an incredible atmosphere, and not just for a women’s football match, but any match. Camp Nou was in full voice for its history-making, treble-winning team – the only time it fell silent was momentarily, as Real Madrid midfielder Claudia Zornoza lobbed goalkeeper Sandra Panos from 35 yards. As good a goal as it was, it was a mere footnote by full-time. This night was about Barcelona, about the excellence of this wonderfully constructed women’s team and the unparalleled job the club has done in supporting it. It was also about Putellas, a player on top of the world right now, scoring in front of an adoring crowd that she was once a part of as a young girl, when she would watch her heroes on the men’s side. The 🐐 in her natural habitat.A crowd worthy of the player. pic.twitter.com/eJhWkabkGY It was about Melanie Serrano, the 32-year-old defender who has been a Barcelona player for 19 years and played for the club before the women’s team was even properly integrated into it. It was also about the players that the likes of Melanie paved the way for – for example, Claudia Pina, Barca's 20-year-old mercurial talent. And it was about those who came before Melanie, too. It was about the women who played in Camp Nou's first ever women’s game in 1970; their efforts and endeavour were crucial in reaching this record-breaking point. This was a night that showed what is possible for the women’s game. On the pitch was the best team in Europe, if not the world, keeping their chances of another treble alive by reaching the Champions League last four. Surrounding them were more fans than have ever turned out for a women’s football match. Both were possible because of the support, promotion and backing of FC Barcelona – because of the way it doesn’t just say it is ‘one club’, but the way it backs up those words with action. Putellas said this week that she believed this evening could spark ""a new era"" in the game. Anyone who was inside the stadium on Wednesday night would agree.  This was bigger than anyone could have imagined.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-real-madrid-historic-camp-nou-clasico-anything/blt463324ede106051f,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3616,'Speaking Spanish helped!' - England goalkeeper Hampton reflects on international debut,"England goalkeeper Hannah Hampton made her senior international debut on Sunday and believes her ability to speak Spanish “definitely helped” as the Lionesses drew 0-0 with Spain in the Arnold Clark Cup. Hampton moved to Spain with her family at the age of five and played with the Villarreal academy for several years, before returning to England aged 10. Speaking to the press after winning her first cap, the 21-year-old, who signed for Aston Villa from local rivals Birmingham City this summer, explained how that benefited her as she kept her clean sheet in her first game for her country. “I can speak Spanish. I'm fluent in Spanish. I was actually saying to a few people at the end of the game, I was listening to everything that the Spanish were saying and telling everyone, 'They're going to do this. They're going to do that',” Hampton revealed. “That definitely helped! “I don't think [the Spain players] knew. I knew a few of them from the youth age groups, coming through England and playing against them, so they might have remembered, but I don't think so.” The young goalkeeper has been in a number of England squads over the last couple of years, going to the 2020 SheBelieves Cup as a training player and winning several call-ups since. However, this was her first time getting on the pitch, a moment she described as “a dream come true”. 💥 A senior debut for @hannahhampton_!Congrats, H 💪 pic.twitter.com/8A7qlkpTw2 “Honestly, I don't think I took a smile on my face from the moment I got told until now really, and I don't think it will be coming off my face for a long time,” she added. “I couldn't really have planned it any better. You go over this day so many times in your head and what you wish for and, honestly, the game then was more than what I could have ever thought it would be. “The wait was definitely worth it. Hopefully, there's many more [games] to come. But I'm not pushing for anything. I'm just going to see where it takes me and how often I get a chance, and if I get a chance again. At the end of the day, I've tried my best and that's all I can do.” England head coach Sarina Wiegman was full of praise for Hampton after the game too, the Aston Villa shot-stopper making four saves to keep her clean sheet intact. “She's a young player, very talented,” the Dutch coach said. “She just needs games like this also to develop. She's has real high potential. I think she showed that today. “Her distribution was very good and that can harm other teams, our opponents. Apart for the one communication [mix-up] in the first half with Jess [Carter, defender], I think she did really well. “That's why you need those games, to get used to each other at the highest level. I think she's happy, but we're all happy for her and with her performance.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/speaking-spanish-helped-england-goalkeeper-hampton-reflects/bltd9d68277e4e158c4,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3653,All Of US: The U.S. Women's Soccer Show talks NWSL offseason moves & USWNT contract developments,"The NWSL Expansion Draft is set for Thursday night, but Angel City FC and the San Diego Wave have already jumped headfirst into roster building with a flurry of moves following the end of the season. Both expansion clubs will select several players from other NWSL teams during the draft, which is likely to be somewhat subdued after many draft-related moves already took place. On this week's episode of All of US: The U.S. Women's Soccer Show, GOAL looks at a busy offseason in the NWSL, as well as some significant developments in contract negotiations between the U.S. women's national team and U.S. Soccer. Several NWSL teams have proactively traded players to Angel City or San Diego ahead of the expansion draft, receiving immunity from the draft in exchange. That has seen USWNT stars like Julie Ertz move from Chicago to Angel City, while Alex Morgan has traded in Orlando for San Diego amid a host of other player moves. Both of the new teams will therefore have a smaller pool of players to choose from in the expansion draft, which has suited all parties well. Many players who have been traded have expressed a desire to join one of the new franchises, which makes for a more comfortable transition than the typical practice of players who are often unwittingly selected in the expansion draft. Meanwhile there was also big national team news this week, with U.S. Soccer announcing it will no longer pay USWNT allocated players to play in the NWSL. The move, though expected, will still have a major impact, as the burden for paying U.S. internationals will now shift entirely to NWSL teams, while the players themselves will have more freedom of movement. The onus will now shift to NWSL owners, who will be required to pay competitive salaries or risk losing their American stars to big-spending teams abroad.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/all-of-us-womens-soccer-show-nwsl-offseason-uswnt-contract/bltec1de2c7935aaefb,Seth Vertelney,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3670,"Who is the Champions League top scorer? Benzema, Putellas and the best UCL and UWCL goals stats of 2021-22","Karim Benzema tops the Champions League goalscoring charts for 2021-22 and still has the chance to add to his tally. The French superstar will once again spearhead the Real Madrid attack in Saturday's final against Liverpool in Paris.  Benzema has already scored a remarkable 15 goals in this season's tournament, and were he to score twice at the Stade de France, he would equal the all-time record for a single campaign, 17, set by former Blancos team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo in 2013-14. Liverpool may boast a brilliant defence, marshalled by Virgil van Dijk, and arguably the world's best goalkeeper in Alisson, but few would bet against Benzema making history, given his rich vein of form. Indeed, the 34-year-old has scored in five consecutive knockout fixtures – a remarkable run which has featured back-to-back hat-tricks, against Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, as well as the decisive spot-kick that sensationally eliminated Manchester City in the semi-finals. Of course, Mohamed Salah will be intent on stealing Benzema's thunder.  The Egyptian winger has already admitted that he will be gunning for revenge, given he was forced off with a shoulder injury early on in Liverpool's 2018 Champions League final loss to Madrid in Kyiv. Salah has struck eight times in this season's tournament and currently sits sixth in the overall rankings.  Pos. Player Club Goals Games 1. Karim Benzema Real Madrid 15 11 2. Robert Lewandowski Bayern Munich 13 10 3. Sebastien Haller Ajax 11 8 4. Alexia Putellas Barcelona 11 10 5. Tabea Wassmuth Wolfsburg 10 10 6. Mohamed Salah Liverpool 8 12 6.

Jennifer Hermoso Barcelona 5 8 22. Rodrygo Real Madrid 5 10 22. Jill Roord Wolfsburg 5 10 24. Sadio Mane Liverpool 5 12 A big performance in Paris could see him move up a couple of paces but he certainly won't be overhauling Benzema at this stage, or even Robert Lewandowski. The Polish striker looked set to battle it out for top spot with Benzema, after 13 goals in just 10 games, but then Bayern Munich were sensationally knocked out in the quarter-finals by Villarreal. Sebastian Haller was also scoring at a remarkable rate for Ajax before their shock elimination at home to Benfica in the last 16. Indeed, he became the first man since Marco van Basten to score four goals on their Champions League debut, before then equalling Cristiano Ronaldo's feat of scoring in all six games in the group stage.  With his first-leg effort against Benfica in the last 16, Haller also became the first man to net in seven consecutive matches in the competition. Alexia Putellas, meanwhile, scored in eight of her 10 appearances as she ended up finishing as top scorer in the UEFA Women's Champions League with 11 goals.  The Barcelona captain's strike in Saturday's final loss to Lyon may not have sparked the comeback that Putellas was hoping for, but it did at least see her edge ahead of Tabea Wassmuth. Like Haller, the Germany international also hit the ground running this season, netting five goals in Wolfsburg's opening three group games.  Wassmuth was also on target in her club's semi-final second leg against Barcelona but Tommy Stroot's team were unable to turn the tie around. Elsewhere, Catarina Macario shares sixth place with Salah, having capped a remarkable campaign with a goal in Lyon's 3-1 win over Barcelona in Turin.  The United States women's national team forward only started playing professional football last year but she played a key role in her French club reaching this season's final. Macario netted in both legs of the 4-3 aggregate win over Juventus in the last eight before bagging a crucial double against Paris Saint-Germain in the semi-finals. The top 10 is completed by Marie-Antoinette Katoto, Christopher Nkunku and Riyad Mahrez, all of whom scored seven goals. Katoto scored in both legs of PSG's UWCL semi-final loss to Lyon but was unable to propel the Parisians to the final. Nkunku, of course, came through the youth team ranks at the Parc des Princes but he proved himself a future star with his group-stage exploits for RB Leipzig this season, hitting a hat-trick against Manchester City on match day one. Leipzig failed to make the knockout stage but not before Nkunku had also netted against Club Brugge (three) and former club PSG. As for Mahrez, the Algerian ace thought that he had sealed Manchester City's place in the men's final with his fine finish at the Santiago Bernabeu but Benzema & Co. had other ideas. Consequently, it is five-time Champions League winner Benzema who is now in a position to cement his status as one of the game's greatest ever goalscorers at the Stade de France this weekend.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/champions-league-top-scorer-benzema-putellas-ucl-uwcl-goals/blte09e0861a627bbb9,Mark Doyle,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3707,'Raises the standard for women's soccer!' - NWSL's KC Current open $19 million training facility,"Kansas City Current midfielder Kristen Edmonds says the club has ""raised"" the bar for women's soccer facilities after opening a dedicated $19 million (£15.5m) training facility for the National Women's Soccer League team. The organization has cut the ribbon on a new facility at Riverside, just outside Kansas City, that breaks new ground for similar set-ups across the country. While the women's game has enjoyed almost unparalleled success on the world stage through the USWNT, the domestic club game has trailed after Major League Soccer, with teams often sharing facilities with men's squads - a dynamic NWSL players hope will change. ""For anybody who wants to come here to play to win championships, they haven’t left any stone unturned,"" Edmonds was quoted as saying by the Kansas City Star. ""You walk into our gym (and) our crest is on our weights, on our barbells. Everything in here is insanely detailed. We even have teal tile in our bathroom. ""They’ve not only raised [the standard for women's soccer], but they raised it to the level that people are gonna have to climb to get to. ""It’s just for us. I think that’s one of the biggest points I keep saying, that we don’t have to share it with anyone. It’s insane to think about that women’s soccer has come this far to where we have our own space."" Welcome to our new home 🏠 pic.twitter.com/MG8Gg0U18q The arrival of solo facilities marks a major step forward amid the ongoing push for sporting equality between both genders within the game, and comes on the heels of the USWNT's protracted attempts to secure matching pay with their male counterparts. It also helps further Kansas City as a major soccer hub, per Riverside Mayor Kathy Rose, who added: ""It was just under 11 months ago that I stood in front of a small ceremonial pile of dirt with Angie, Chris, and their two boys. ""With shovels in their hands on that bright August morning, we broke ground on their unprecedented commitment to providing world-class facilities, for world-class athletes, in a world-class soccer city.""

3710,All Of US: The U.S. Women's Soccer Show breaks down USWNT and NWSL contract negotiations ,"With games slowing down over the coming weeks, the focus in American women's soccer has shifted to two hugely consequential contract negotiations. The U.S. women's national team and NWSL players are both in talks with their respective employers over new collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). On this week's episode of All of US: The U.S. Women's Soccer Show, GOAL talks all things CBA with UCLA law professor Steven Bank. The USWNT will see their current CBA expire at the end of 2021 and are currently in talks with U.S. Soccer over a new agreement. U.S. Soccer has called on the USWNT to negotiate a single CBA alongside the U.S. men's national team, who have been playing under the terms of the CBA that expired in 2018. The biggest hurdle involves prize money from the World Cup. FIFA awards far more to men's teams than women's teams ($400 million in total prize money for the 2018 Men's World Cup versus $38m in 2019 for the Women's World Cup), and has called on the USWNT and USMNT to evenly split the prize money in their next CBA. The USWNT sued U.S. Soccer over the terms of their current CBA, alledging gender discrimination. After a judge ruled in U.S. Soccer's favor last year over the pay equity portion of the suit, the USWNT are appealing. The NWSL, meanwhile, has been operating without a CBA for their first nine seasons. The league's players' association is looking to change that heading into the 2022 campaign. NWSL players are aiming for more freedom of movement, higher salaries, and increased player protection after a number of abuse scandals rocked the league in 2021. Currently, 75 percent of the league's players make less than $31,000 per year, a figure the NWSL players' union is looking to improve upon.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/us-womens-soccer-uswnt-nwsl-contract-negotiations/blte8c213658a0261dd,Seth Vertelney,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3739,'That has changed women’s sport!' - Ex-England boss Neville shares 'immense pride' after Euro 2022 triumph,"Phil Neville thinks England's Euro 2022 win will change the course of women's participation in sport, and feels immensely proud of the achievement by ""his girls"" as they won a major trophy for the first time in 56 years courtesy of a Chloe Kelly winner in the 110th minute of the final against Germany.  Neville had previously worked with these players as he took charge of the Lionesses in 2018 and guided them to SheBelieves Cup in 2019 before reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup later that year. However, their form went south and he decided to move to the United States to take charge of Inter Miami in January 2021.  Neville was watching the final in the company of David Beckham and got extremely emotional after England bagged the trophy at Wembley in front of 87,192 fans.  ""That’s changed women’s sport, never mind women's soccer,” Neville said. “There’s only one word, just immense pride. ""I watched the game with David and we jumped up, we celebrated and we felt just an immense pride watching it. I did feel emotionally attached because I always say, 'These are my girls. These are the girls that inspired me and made me a better manager.'"" Neville handed Kelly her debut against Austria in November 2018 and added: ""She was just a little baby at the time. She was literally shaking as I put her on the field. Now she scores a goal in the Euro final. It was an emotional moment for me.  ""I was going to say 90 minutes but it was extra time as well. It was an emotional moment because all these girls have inspired me and 87,000 people at Wembley Stadium and I think 20 million people back home in England watching [on TV]. That's changed women's sport, never mind women's soccer."" 🏆 OUR ENGLAND. OUR CHAMPIONS. 🏆 pic.twitter.com/gf4BHUd5fW The United States, four-time World Cup winners and four-time Olympic gold medallists, are the No.1 country in the FIFA rankings. However, Neville feels that other teams are catching up with them and the USWNT need to pull up their socks once again.  ""America was always the standard-bearer,” Neville said. “I feel as if the rest of the world has caught up and maybe America’s maybe a little bit complacent now. Maybe this has given them a we-need-to-kick-on-again [feeling]. ""I always felt that eventually, the world would kick up to the incredible coaching development opportunities for females in sport in America. ""Me, when I got the job, I was thinking we need to be like America on and off the pitch. I think the rest of the world is catching up very quickly and if not in some aspects taking over."" Neville's successor, Sarina Wiegman, will be offered a new contract which should see her stay at the helm of the team till 2025, including the World Cup next summer. The Lionesses are already on the cusp of qualifying for the marquee event as they lead UEFA qualifying Group D.

3857,Arsenal release injured USWNT star Heath after just 18 appearances,"Arsenal have announced that United States international Tobin Heath has been granted early release from her contract in north London after picking up an untimely injury. The two-time World Cup winner was due to see a one-year deal with the Gunners expire in the summer, but a hamstring problem has brought her 2021-22 campaign to a premature conclusion. With that in mind, a mutual agreement means that club and player will now be parting ways, allowing a 33-year-old forward to complete her rehabilitation back on American soil.

I have no doubt that they are bound for success in the near future and I’ll be supporting the team with the rest of the Arsenal family from now on.” Gunners head coach Jonas Eidevall added: “It’s been a pleasure to work with Tobin this season. “She has made an important contribution both on and off the pitch, with her mentality and character setting a great example to the entire group. “We wish Tobin well for the future and look forward to seeing what comes next for her.” Tobin Heath has been released early from her contract by mutual agreement. Wishing you all the best for the future, @TobinHeath ❤️ Heath linked up with Arsenal after seeing fitness concerns limit her to just 11 appearances for Manchester United in the 2020-21 campaign. She was to fare slightly better in the English capital, but still took in just 18 outings for the Gunners and found the target on three occasions – including a 90th minute equaliser in a meeting with fellow Women’s Super League title hopefuls Manchester City. More would have been expected by all concerned, with Heath left particularly frustrated at failing to make a greater impact at the club she grew up supporting. It remains to be seen where Heath’s next move will take her, as her NWSL rights were taken by Louisville during her stint in Manchester.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-release-injured-uswnt-star-heath-after-just-18/blt1adeabdfdeee6e8f,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3866,‘Marta asked me how old I was!’ – USWNT hopeful Ekic recalls being ‘starstruck’ on Racing Louisville debut,"Racing Louisville forward Emina Ekic has recalled her surreal NWSL debut last year, which saw her play against and take home the shirt of her idol, Marta. The 22-year-old was the fifth overall pick in the 2021 NWSL Draft after an impressive college career at the University of Louisville. Chosen by the team that had just launched in the same city, it would continue her soccer journey in her home city, too. Ekic’s first competitive game would come just a few months later, when Racing took on the Orlando Pride, a team led by Brazil icon Marta, the player widely regarded as the greatest ever to grace the women’s game. Speaking to GOAL on All of US: The U.S. Women’s Soccer Show about her first NWSL season, Ekic said: “If I'm being honest with you, I was probably starstruck all last year. “It started to wear off towards the end. It's worn off now. But I remember my first game and Marta actually talked to me. I love Marta. I grew up watching her. She was my idol. I love the way she plays. “She stopped in the middle of the game, she just looked me up and down and she asked me how old I was. Because she's like, 'You look very young'. I was like, 'Yeah, I'm 21'. Then she ran off and I had a double take and I was like, 'Oh, I need to go follow her. She's going to get the ball!' “I honestly didn't think I would get to play with many of [my idols]. I thought they would be done or retired, but it's really cool that they're still around.” Ekic would get to swap shirts with Marta at full time too. “I got her to sign it as well,” she said. “I have it on a hanger, but I need to get it framed.” It wasn’t possible for Ekic to dream of playing NWSL soccer in her home city when she was growing up but, on All of US, she talked about the two big goals she had - playing for the University of Louisville and the U.S. women’s national team. Lots of young players in top form in the NWSL have been called into camp for the latter by head coach Vlatko Andonovski in recent months, and that is something is the Racing Louisville forward says is “very motivating” for her. “The roster right now is super young and it's been a goal of mine ever since I could remember,” she added. “It was always the University of Louisville and then the national team. It was just those two things me and my dad would aim for. “I definitely have opportunities to play with the Bosnia national team as well, which is really cool, and I would love to get over in Europe and experience that and see what it's like, but I am super excited for the opportunities that I have here and what's to come. “I want to play for the U.S. and finally get my chance and get to that level.” It's only fitting Marta now owns the 🐐 of @NWSL kits. pic.twitter.com/8qGKgt6Iv6 You can find All of US simply by searching for it on your preferred podcast platform, be that Spotify, Apple, or something else.

3875,"Arnold Clark Cup 2022: England tournament fixture schedule, TV channels, squads & guide","The England women's national team welcomed Canada, Germany and Spain in February for the Arnold Clark Cup, the first edition of its new invitational international tournament. All four nations have previously competed at the SheBelieves Cup, hosted by the U.S. women's national team, but spent the first international break of 2022 in England, playing across three venues: Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium, Norwich City's Carrow Road and Molineux, home of Wolves. The tournament kicked off on February 17 and concluded on February 23. The winner of the round-robin format competition was England, the Lionesses winning one and drawing two of their three fixtures. All of the games at the Arnold Clark Cup were shown across ITV in the United Kingdom. Five of the six games were broadcast on ITV4, with the exception being England's game with Spain on February 20. That fixture was live on ITV's main channel. Every game was also be available live on ITV Hub, ITV's online video platform. Further broadcast deals were agreed worldwide, including with CBS in the U.S. and TSN in Canada.

3887,Hatch counters USWNT legend Carli Lloyd's criticisms of 'worst ever seen' team culture that she 'hated',"Ashley Hatch has talked up the “good atmosphere” and “lots of laughs” in the USWNT camp as a positive response is offered to criticism from Carli Lloyd, who had claimed she “hated” being part of a squad more concerned with “brand” than results. A modern-day great – one with 316 caps to her name – has suggested that the United States women’s team rather lost its way towards the end of her remarkable career, with the “worst” culture she had seen across 16 years taking hold. Hatch has countered those comments by pointing out that there is plenty of positivity in a harmonious squad at present, with everyone involved in Vlatko Andonovski’s ranks prepared to work hard for the cause. Washington Spirit forward Hatch, who has registered three goals through six appearances for her country, has told The Guardian of being involved with the USWNT: “It’s a good atmosphere. It’s very serious, because we all take our jobs and camp and playing for the national team very seriously. “Whenever we do have any free time, you usually hear lots of laughs. “We’re all leaders, by the way we play.” Two-time World Cup winner Lloyd recently claimed that the mood in the U.S. squad changed once they became more successful and players gained greater recognition in the global game. She told the ‘Hope Solo Speaks’ podcast: “Even within our squad, the culture has changed. “It was really tough and challenging to play these last several years. To be quite honest, I hated it. It wasn't fun going in. It was only for love of the game, really, for me. “I wanted to win, and I wanted to help the team, but the culture within the team was the worst I’d ever seen it. I'm hoping that the future is bright and some things change.” She added: “In 2015, winning a World Cup obviously put us on a really big, big stage, and endorsements started coming, and the spotlight started coming, and I just saw a shift in people’s mindsets. “It became more about 'what can I do to build my brand off the field? What can I do to get an endorsement deal' and less about what we have to do when we step in between those lines.” While Lloyd had her issues with the USWNT ranks, Hatch claims everyone involved with the squad right now – on the back of a new collective agreement and legal case victory that will deliver equal pay across the men’s and women’s games – is pulling in the same direction ahead of another bid for World Cup glory in 2023. She said: “Every game, from the minute the whistle blows, we want to be super overwhelming for the other team. “Not let them have any chance on the ball. Quick regains, quick counter-attack, quick transition. Just an in-your-face style of soccer that is really fun to be a part of.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/hatch-uswnt-legend-carli-lloyd-worst-ever-seen-hated/blt370f36cd17a5865d,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3920,'English people can drink!' - Wiegman lifts lid on Euro 2022 celebrations,"The celebrations went on late into the night after England bagged their first Women's European Championship title and manager Sarina Weigman was astonished to find out the amount of booze the Lionesses drank at the party. The Dutch manager's troops emerged triumphant against Germany in a thrilling finale at Wembley on Sunday. Ella Toone opened the scoring, but a German equaliser via Lina Magull forced the game to go to extra time.  Manchester City's Chloe Kelly proved to be the difference-maker as she scored her first international goal in the 110th minute, which ended up clinching the much-coveted trophy for Wiegman's side.  It was a momentous occasion for English football and the players were absolutely jubilant after winning the trophy on their third attempt.  They were seen celebrating with the fans and even gate-crashed their manager's post-match press conference by storming the room singing the famous 'Three Lions' anthem and climbing on the table. However, that was just the beginning as the celebrations went on inside the hotel with lots of booze, singing, and dancing.  How were the celebrations, boss? 🥳#LionessesLive pic.twitter.com/v2cBGLfEbA ""Crazy. Lots of music, lots of dancing. English people can drink,"" Wiegman said of the euphoric scenes. ""A little bit too much alcohol, I think. But that's OK. We enjoyed it.

3940,‘Our work isn’t done until we’ve won the Champions League!’ – Why Olympic medallists are choosing Brighton’s women’s football project,"In the last two Women’s Super League seasons, only two teams have taken points from reigning champions Chelsea on more than one occasion. One of those teams is Arsenal, the most successful team in the history of English women’s football and the side that are closest to challenging the Blues in this year’s title race. The other? Brighton, a team on course to match its best-ever finish in the WSL as this season enters its final stretch. Only promoted to the WSL in 2018, it was the Seagulls who ended Chelsea’s 33-game, two-year unbeaten streak in the league last February. They also took a point from Emma Hayes’ side in January. But while these outcomes were surprising, they were by no means ‘freak’ results. In the past four years, this is a club that has established itself as one that can upset the applecart. In fact, Brighton spent part of the first half of the season in the WSL's European places. That is a testament to the work that the club is doing – as is the fact that two Olympic silver medallists arrived at the club earlier this year. A few months after reaching the Olympic final with Sweden, Emma Kullberg and Julia Zigiotti Olme were announced as Brighton players. Polly Bancroft, Brighton’s head of women’s and girls’ football, tells GOAL that the pair were “so impressed” by what the club could offer, while when Kullberg is asked what it was that stood out, she responds: “Everything”. “The group has a really good group dynamic and you can build so much with this team,"" she says. ""I think that is just fantastic to have. Everyone is working hard for each other, that's the thing on the pitch, but the facilities are great here."" “I don't think you can get this on the women's side yet in Sweden,” she adds, referring to the brand-new facility Brighton’s women’s team moved into in late 2021, after the club invested £8.5 million ($11m) into the training ground. “Hopefully, it will get there and hopefully soon, because this is how it should be.” “We've our own pitches, changing rooms, gym, resistance pool, hot and cold pools,” Bancroft explains. “To be at the top of the pecking order in terms of access to those facilities is probably unrivalled within the league, and possibly globally as well. You no longer have access challenges. “I think that infrastructure really sets the precedent for then everything else that follows out of it: the quality staff that we have working here, the vision, the integrated approach, the strategic work that we're doing. I think all those things together put us, certainly, in the mix in terms of one of the most professionally run outfits in the league.” That is part of why Brighton is able to attract players that some might not expect, and why it is continuing to make a real name for itself. Another factor in that infrastructure is a youth system that produces top talent. Defender Maya Le Tissier, who ranked at No.7 in the NXGN 2021 list of the world's best teenage talents, has established herself as one of England’s most exciting young prospects, with teenagers Maisie Symonds and Libby Bance next on that conveyor belt. ""Brighton are very fortunate to have her and I personally believe she has a very promising career ahead of her at club and England level.” - Victoria WilliamsMaya Le Tissier is at #️⃣7️⃣ on the #NXGN list of the best wonderkids in women's football pic.twitter.com/wxc4KzEC0X Throw in the club’s commitment to an environment that embodies “openness”, as Kullberg describes it, and it is no wonder success continues to come. “We're starting to listen to the voices of the players,” Bancroft says, explaining one of the “smaller” but “equally important” projects the club is working on – a player council. “Some of the results that we've seen from that is that we've changed the colour of the kit shorts for the girls’ academy. We've moved away from white to blue, a darker colour, so particularly for those girls that are just starting their menstrual cycle, they don't have to have that worry of playing in white shorts. “Little things like that, they might seem little, but they're so important.” As for the bigger projects, the club is writing a strategy to fulfil its vision to be a top-four club. After avoiding relegation in its first WSL season, Brighton have really started to push on. ""We've done a lot of work around about who we are, how we want to be viewed, the culture,” manager Hope Powell said earlier this season when asked about the evolution. “[It's] very, very important to me, the culture. If you get that right, and everybody believes in the same outcome, you give yourself half a chance. “I think what really helps is when you start winning football matches. [Then], automatically that belief, that inner belief, that collective belief starts to shine through. The players work very, very hard, tirelessly, in training and that's starting to show through. “It's really that belief that we can, now and again, beat the likes of Chelsea. Maybe not always at this point, but we've got that. The challenge now is we've got to make that sustainable and continue over the course of the season."" “[That ambition is] important because I want to achieve higher and I want to work hard to get better. If the club also has that mindset, everyone will have it,” Kullberg adds. “We are working in the same direction. Even if it's a tough period, we always can go back to see what we want to work for and what we want to achieve.” That ambition is evident in the staff beyond the players and coaches. It is that which makes Bancroft and Powell, for example, work so well together. “We're both very driven,” the former explains. “We both want to achieve that top-four vision. “We also joke that our work isn't done until we've won the Champions League and retained it! I think that sort of aligns to both of our ambitions, really.” With everyone on that same page at Brighton, they have got plenty of what it takes to be successful. No wonder they continue to add big players to this squad – and take down the giants.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/work-isnt-done-won-champions-league-olympic-medallists/blt19368a052eea0e96,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4018,‘Australia want to remain the No.1 team in Asia’ – Matildas star Carpenter hopeful of AFC Women's Asian Cup glory,"Australia star Ellie Carpenter is hopeful of adding the AFC Women's Asian Cup to her growing trophy collection, with the Matildas going into this month’s tournament with the aim of maintaining their status as “the number one team in Asia”. Carpenter joined seven-time European champions Lyon in 2020 and has picked up a Champions League title and the French cup since, following two pieces of silverware at home with Melbourne City. She’s yet to pick up a major trophy with her country though, with 2010 champions Australia one of the favourites going into this year’s Asian Cup, having reached the last three finals. Speaking in an exclusive interview with GOAL, Carpenter said: “I think any major tournament is exciting. This Asian Cup is definitely going to be the most competitive. There are so many great nations now, especially in Asia, and the level is getting higher and that's just credit to every country, and the league and their development as well in women's football. “We want to win it and remain the number one team in Asia. That's our ambition but it only comes around every four years so we're excited. “For me, being a part of the Matildas, we haven't won what we would have liked to win in the past, but definitely one thing that I would love to do with this team is win the Asian Cup. “Last time, we fell short to Japan in the final, but one thing that we would love as a team is to get that silverware in the Asian Cup. “Then, we want to build towards the World Cup at home [next year]. That's massive for us. We're trying everything that we can do to be in the best shape possible come that tournament and hopefully create something special that no one else has done before.” Carpenter has plenty of experience in winning trophies already, despite being just 21 years old. The full-back was part of the Melbourne City team that won the Premiership and Championship titles in Australia in 2020, before joining a very successful Lyon side. However, her experiences with the Matildas have not been as triumphant yet. She was part of the team that reached the semi-finals at the Olympics in 2021, but lost in the last four and then lost the bronze medal match to the U.S. women’s national team. She was also involved as Australia reached the Asian Cup final in 2018, where they were beaten 1-0 thanks to Kumi Yokoyama’s 84th minute strike. Asked if the latter experience will be on her mind for this year’s tournament, Carpenter said: “I definitely think so. Every time we play Japan, it's always a tough game, or it's always a 50-50. “We never like to lose, especially not twice against the same opposition in the same tournament. We'll be very hungry to win and we want to obviously lift that trophy at the end.” On what winning that first trophy with her country would mean, the young defender added: “It would mean a lot. I'm very excited for the tournament and hopefully we can do that. “I guess it'd be five, six years in the making to lift the first trophy with the Matildas. It would be a proud moment.” The 2022 edition of the Asian Cup kicks off on January 20, when China take on Chinese Taipei. Hosts India will then face Iran later that day. Australia’s first match comes on January 21, when they face Indonesia. Also in their group is the Philippines, led by former Matildas coach Alen Stajcic, and Thailand. The final will be played on February 6 at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/australia-no-1-team-asia-matildas-star-carpenter-hopeful/blt69731215aae006e6,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4023,Laura Ricketts reveals plans for Chelsea in first statement: We strive to be champions both on and off the field,"Laura Ricketts has spoken about her family's meetings ahead of their final bid to buy Chelsea and moved again to reassure supporters about their record on diversity.  It comes after the Ricketts Family Investment Group, which features backing from Citadel Founder Ken Griffin and one of America's richest men Dan Gilbert, has proven unpopular with the club's support.  In fact, only three percent of Chelsea Supporters Trust (CST) members said they would back the bid led by the owners of the historic Major League Baseball (MLB) team Chicago Cubs. Three other rival billionaire bidders are seeking to secure Chelsea after making their final bids on April 11.   ""We have had a memorable few days in London, taking the opportunity to meet as many people as possible from a wide variety of backgrounds,"" Laura Ricketts, who is the face of the bid alongside her brother Tom, said in her first statement. ""Obviously, I can’t comment on talks we had with Chelsea officials because that has to remain confidential. But I can say we had very informative and enjoyable meetings with some passionate fan groups – in particular with Tracy Brown from Chelsea Pride and Kerrie Evans from Chelsea Women Supporters Group. ""We also met Sanjay Bhandari, the Chair of Kick It Out, and it was wonderful to hear about all the work he’s doing. We admire their approach and would like to introduce them to Major League Baseball. ""I was also thrilled to go to the Chelsea Women’s game at the weekend and I flew in early to make the match. It was a joy to see the incredible athletic talent of the Chelsea Women and to also experience the supporters’ amazing energy at Kingsmeadow. ""Much of my life’s work has been about empowering and supporting women, so to see these young women playing at this level was a real treat for me. It was also so great to see all the families who were at the game. ""Sport has such power to bring communities together and family is at the heart of the community. Some of the girls there reminded me of my 11-year-old daughter. For young girls to see the Chelsea Women on the pitch can be inspiring and empowering to them. ""In recent weeks, we’ve also had several valuable conversations with the Chelsea Supporters’ Trust. I appreciate their passion for Chelsea and the important questions they’ve raised. I look forward to continuing the good conversations we’ve begun. ""We all need to be listening and speaking up, and I feel a particular responsibility because of the position I’m in. We’re not going to be able to persuade all the fans right away that we will be good stewards of Chelsea – we’re going to have to show them with meaningful action if we are successful in our bid. ""F*** off the Ricketts, you're not wanted here."" #cfc #NoToRicketts pic.twitter.com/wyd0b04Huo ""But I can assure all Chelsea fans that it has been my life’s work to fight against discrimination and bigotry of any kind. ""Coming out as an LGBTQ+ woman has influenced my perspective and sensitivity about diversity and inclusion. I can’t know what it’s like to walk in another person’s shoes, but I can begin to understand and have an awareness of their different experience. And that’s a gift. In the position that I’m in, I feel a sense of responsibility to be an advocate. To me, being an advocate means speaking up, and also listening. ""When we assumed responsibility for the Chicago Cubs and its legacy, we immediately realised that teams like the Cubs don’t belong to one person or organisation. They belong to the fans. We’re stewards – and we’re answerable to the fans. That’s how we see it in Chicago – and it would be exactly the same at Chelsea. ""There is such power in sport for community building and to bring diverse people together. At Cubs Charities, we have developed our own sport-based youth development programming that engages young people and families in under-served communities. As the Chair of Cubs Charities, I am proud of our work and the impact it has on so many lives. ""Here, the Chelsea Foundation already makes a significant impact and I would hope we could help build on this. We strive to be champions both on and off the field. It’s what makes Chelsea great, and is a tradition we would honour if we were to become the club’s next stewards."" Those close to the process seem to believe that they are among two favourites of the four main options. The Los Angeles Dodgers owner Todd Boehly is leading a bid that seems to be a strong competitor and it has backing from Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and UK investor Jonathan Goldstein. Boehly was pictured at Stamford Bridge during Chelsea's 3-1 home defeat to Real Madrid on Wednesday night.

4049,Messi’s Barcelona successor? Putellas is the Champions League goalscorer now reigning supreme at Camp Nou,"Ahead of Barcelona's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Real Madrid, Alexia Putellas said that she hoped the historic clash at a sold-out Camp Nou would signal ""the start of a new era"" for women's football. ""I'm sure that many, many girls will dream about being the women on that pitch in 20 years' time,"" she said a day before a record-breaking attendance of 91,553 people, which has since been bettered by the same club at the same venue. The thing is, though, Alexia is already a source of inspiration to those hoping to play at the very highest level, a shining example of what can be achieved when natural talent is complemented by a winning mentality. Just look at the story of Real Betis defender Andrea Medina, who ranked eighth in this year's NXGN list. The 17-year-old grew up idolising Roberto Carlos and Ronaldo. Now, though, Medina says that Alexia is the ""reference point for everyone"". ""When I was a girl, there were still no female role models,"" she told GOAL, ""but now little girls do have female role models."" And none greater than Alexia, the new face of FC Barcelona. When Lionel Messi waved a tearful goodbye to the Catalan club last August, he left a massive void at Camp Nou. Alexia has filled it, taking Messi’s mantle as the club’s humble hero. Indeed, now it is she who is omnipresent in Barcelona. Her Majesty 👋 pic.twitter.com/VO7wGnLlZm Parks and pitches are full of boys and girls wearing jerseys adorned with 'Alexia 11'. Her image can be found on billboards and stalls all around Camp Nou. The club’s social media channels have even started referring to the 27-year-old as “Her Majesty”. And it's easy to understand why. Alexis is the pride of Catalunya, the local girl ‘done good’. Unlike Messi, she hasn't always been the best player in the world. She wasn’t a pre-ordained superstar from a young age. She had to battle her way to the top. Alexia spent a season at Barca as a kid but it was at crosstown rivals Espanyol that she broke into the senior ranks. A season at Levante followed before she eventually secured a return to Barcelona in 2012. Even then, there were doubts. Her talent was obvious, but did she have the temperament, the tenacity, to become one of the world's best midfielders? ""I played against Alexia when she was very young,"" former Arsenal goalkeeper Emma Byrne, who now works for Barca TV, told GOAL. ""Technically, she's always been good, but she never had the pace and physicality. And in Champions League games, she often disappeared. “However, over the past two years, she's just gone to another level because she’s worked so hard on the fitness side of things. “She’s quicker, she's stronger, she’s more experienced and she’s extremely competitive. “She's become a real leader at Barca and that’s why she was such a worthy Ballon d’Or winner last year.” The 🐐 in her natural habitat.A crowd worthy of the player. pic.twitter.com/eJhWkabkGY Indeed, nobody would dare dispute that Alexia is now the best player in the world. The stats speak for themselves. Last season, she scored a remarkable 37 goals from midfield, while at the same time racking up 27 assists as Barcelona pulled off a stunning treble by winning the Primera Iberdrola, Copa de la Reina and UEFA Women's Champions League. Incredibly, she and Barcelona are perfectly poised to repeat the feat. A domestic double looks a certainty, with the Spanish title having already been secured without losing a single game, while the Blaugranes booked their place in a second consecutive Champions League final by seeing off Wolfsburg 5-3 on aggregate in the last four. This month's tournament decider, against Lyon in Turin, is expected to attract greater interest than ever before. In that sense, this really does feel like the start of a new era for the women’s game. However, a new era has already begun at Barcelona. Messi’s glorious reign ended last summer. Alexia is now the Queen of Camp Nou.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-barcelona-successor-putellas-champions-league/blt0fd397791529cc3d,Mark Doyle,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4062,'So much quality' - Barcelona star Putellas first woman to reach 100 caps for Spain,"Alexia Putellas has become the first Spain women's national team footballer to reach 100 caps for her country, after she featured in their friendly with Italy on Friday. The Barcelona star netted to help her side earn a draw as she brought up a century of senior appearances for La Roja, breaking new ground in the process. She follows in the footsteps of several of her international men's contemporaries - but stands alone among her countrywomen in making history. Putellas is in rarefied territory as the first woman from Spain to get to 100 caps, joining the ranks of 13 men's players who have represented La Roja more than a hundred times. The Barcelona star was delighted to reach the milestone, and vowed that it will not be the last boundary she breaks, stating: ""I’m happy because I never thought I would reach this mark. ""It’s the result of a lot of work through the years. Hopefully there will be many more matches to come, along with many titles as well."" Following the confirmation of her vital cap, Spain boss Jorge Vilda was fast to sing his star's praises, highlighting her drive and intellectual grasp of the game as key strengths to her longevity near the summit of the sport. ""She’s young and, best of all, is passionate about football and understands it very well, which is not something every player has,"" he added.  ""She has so much quality, sees things before others and executes everything with pace and style.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-star-putellas-first-woman-to-reach-100-caps-for/blt60e403b724b0fdc1,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4072,Nigeria's Oshoala wins Golden Boot with Barcelona Femeni,"Nigeria striker Asisat Oshoala has emerged as the top scorer in the women’s Spanish Primera Division with Barcelona Femeni. The 27-year-old Super Falcons forward achieved the feat after scoring 20 goals in 19 league appearances and will share the award with Brazilian Geyse Ferreira, who managed 20 goals in 27 appearances for Madrid CFF. The award was confirmed on Sunday after Barcelona finished the season with a 2-1 victory against Atletico Madrid at Estadi Johan Cruyff. In the game that saw both teams reduced to ten players, Oshoala was introduced in the 63rd minute for Jenifer Hermoso but she could not add to her tally of goals. Barcelona scored through Irene Paredes in the 11th minute before Aitana Bonmati made it 2-0 in the 23rd minute. Amanda Sampedro pulled a goal back for Atletico in the 64th minute but this was after their player Merel van Dongen has been sent off for a second bookable offence. ᴘɪᴄʜɪᴄʜɪ⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚡ @AsisatOshoala pic.twitter.com/kPiEekKy6j Barcelona were also not spared as goal scorer Bonmati was red-carded in stoppage time. It was versus Sporting de Huelva that Oshoala scored for the first time in the league this season in a 6-0 victory on October 18.  She also had one assist to her name during the campaign. Oshoala switched to Barcelona in July 2019 from Arsenal, for whom she made 13 league appearances in total, scoring two goals. In topping the goal scorer’s chart, Oshoala, who stayed out of action for eight weeks this campaign owing to injury, became the first Nigerian to achieve the feat. Her goals also helped Barcelona to win the league title unbeaten with 30 wins in 30 games. The team scored 159 goals and conceded only 11. Barcelona and Oshoala will now shift their focus to the Uefa Women’s Champions League final where they are scheduled to take on Lyon at Juventus Stadium on May 21. They will then take on Real Madrid in the semi-final of the Copa de la Reina at Santo Domingo four days later.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/nigeria-oshoala-wins-golden-boot-with-barcelona-femeni/blt21805a32b1a50efa,Dennis Mabuka,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

4187,What is Alexia Putellas' record vs Real Madrid? Barcelona star's Clasico goals & assists,"Barcelona midfielder Alexia Putellas is the best female footballer on the planet right now - a status confirmed by her Ballon d'Or win late last year. The Spain international helped Barca win the treble in the 2020-21 season and has got them on track to repeat the trick this year with her contributions. Unfortunately for the Catalans' biggest rivals, Real Madrid, they know full well just how good Putellas is too, with her record against the newly-launched women's side already incredible. The second leg of the Women's Champions League quarter-final between Barcelona and Real Madrid can be watched exclusively live on DAZN. Check out the highlights of the first leg in the video below. Putellas has only played against Real Madrid six times, because it was only in the summer of 2020 that the Spanish club launched a women's team for the first time - having played under the name of Tacon for a season before that. However, the 28-year-old has scored seven goals already against the club, as well as providing two assists. One of the most high-profile moments in this newly-established rivalry came in March 2021, when Barca beat Real 5-0 in the league to win a third successive league title. This one came with six games to spare, with a 100 per cent record still intact. The Madrid club had held steady for most of the first half in that meeting, until the brilliance of Putellas undid them just before the break. Goals in the 41st and 43rd minute from the midfield maestro set Barca on their way to a crushing victory and also gave the captain her first of two doubles against Real in nine days, as she would net twice against the club again in the Champions League the following week. So far, Putellas has a 100 per cent win record when playing against Real Madrid, scoring in five of their six meetings.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/alexia-putellas-record-vs-real-madrid-barcelona-star-clasico/blt237e49a39cbbd3e8,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

4225,Super Bowl vs World Cup & Champions League: How do viewing figures for soccer & NFL showpieces compare?,"Football fans are in for a treat throughout 2022, with fans of both soccer and NFL counting down the days to Super Bowl LVI, another Champions League final, the UEFA European Women’s Football Championship and a World Cup in Qatar. American football’s big day in the sun is first on the calendar, with the Los Angeles Rams set to face the Cincinnati Bengals at their SoFi Stadium home in California on February 13. Millions will tune in to watch that contest from around the world, with an ever-growing legion of loyal followers extending well beyond the boundaries of the United States, but how do viewing figures stack up against flagship events in soccer? GOAL takes a look… According to FIFA, the 2018 World Cup final – which saw France overcome Croatia 4-2 – reached an average worldwide audience of 517 million viewers, with over 1.1 billion spectators tuning in at some point over the course of 90 thrilling minutes. In comparison, the Super Bowl tends to average just under 100 million viewers in the USA, with a further 30-50 million tuning in from elsewhere. In 2021, figures for a meeting between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Kansas City Chiefs came in at just 96.4 million in the States – making it the lowest watched Super Bowl since 2007. When turning attention to European football’s showpiece event, viewing figures still dwarf those that the Super Bowl pulls in. The Champions League final tends to attract between 380 million and 400 million spectators that are tuning in from outside of the venue playing host to a star-studded occasion. UEFA will also be delighted to hear that Euro 2020 pulled in a cumulative live match audience of over 5 billion, while 328 million fans watched a final showdown between England and Italy at Wembley Stadium – with the contest being the most-watched televised event in the UK for 24 years. Rank Event Viewers 1 Tour de France 3.5 billion 2 Soccer World Cup 3.3 billion 3 Cricket World Cup 2.6 billion 4 Summer Olympic Games 2 billion 5 Winter Olympic Games 2 billion 6 Women's World Cup 1.12 billion 7 Boxing 1 billion 8 UEFA Champions League 380 million 9 Super Bowl 99 million 10 NCAA Final Four 16.9 million While football dominates a global market across various competitions, it is cycling’s Tour de France that continues to pull in the biggest viewing figures. The Cricket World Cup, both versions of the Olympic Games – summer and winter – and certain high-profile boxing events all attract over 1 billion spectators and rank above the Super Bowl in a global top 10. In terms of television broadcasts alone, tournaments which are spread over a month tend to bring in the greatest cumulative viewership. Euro 2020, which took place across June and July 2021, boasted a record 5 billion TV viewers. After that comes the 2016 Rio Summer Paralympics with 4.1 billion viewers. The 2012 London Summer Olympics and 2016 Rio Summer Olympics complete the top billing with each event drawing in 3.6 billion viewers.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/super-bowl-vs-world-cup-champions-league-viewing-figures/blte47db8809dbd0a6d,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

So why is there no Premier League football this weekend? GOAL is here to bring you everything you need to know including which games from other competitions across the globe will be on TV, if you need your football fix.

4304,Germany are eight-time Women's European champions - so why were they written off before England 2022?,"Going into this summer’s Women’s Euros, Germany star Giulia Gwinn admitted things were “a bit” weird. Not because of anything she or her team-mates were saying or doing. It was simply down to the fact that the eight-time European champions were just not being talked about as potential winners. In their first five games of 2022, Martina Voss-Tecklenburg’s side won one, drew one and lost three. There were mitigating circumstances at February’s Arnold Clark Cup due to injuries and Covid-19, but a 3-2 defeat to Serbia in April only strengthened the growing belief that this team wouldn’t be ready to challenge for the Euros title in England. That all changed in June, though, when Germany played their one and only pre-tournament friendly. “We didn't really feel the pressure from the external factor,” Lena Oberdorf, the versatile German wonderkid who was GOAL’s 2020 NXGN winner, explained. “It was more that we put ourselves under pressure because we know what kind of quality we have and we know what kind of players we have.  ""Then, it's just showing this because, in the past, we also had those games where we didn't really get it on the pitch and everybody was like, 'Nah, Germany, they're not going to do anything this tournament.' “Then, we won 7-0 against Switzerland. Everybody was like, 'They're going to win!'” That rout of their neighbours changed the conversation on the outside.  But the key reason this team has had such an incredible tournament so far – beating Denmark 4-0, Spain 2-0 and Finland 3-0 in the group stages to set-up a quarter-final against Austria – is not because they are focused on fulfilling outside expectations. “I think the biggest pressure is from within,"" defender Sophia Kleinherne believes. “Our self-given objective is to play the best possible tournament.  ""As a team, we know how to deal with that. It is the target and objective for all of us, from the players to the kit men.” There’s a reason why they put that pressure on themselves. After all, this is a talented team well-capable of winning the Euros. A look at the squad list and it’s clear to see. In Alexandra Popp, they have one of Germany’s greatest ever players, a versatile leader with two Champions League titles to her name.  Goalkeeper Merle Frohms is easily one of the best in the world, her highlights reel at this tournament so far only supporting that claim.  Then, there are the young stars making their mark, such as Klara Buhl and Nicole Anyomi, both goalscorers in England this summer. But it’s also about the experience throughout this team – not just in a player like Popp, but also those still in their early 20s. Oberdorf and Gwinn, for example, have both already played at major tournaments. “I don't recognise that I'm 20,” Oberdorf, now a staple of this side, said. “I feel like when I'm on the pitch, everybody sees me as like a 28-year-old player.  ""On the pitch, I just forget about my age, just play, just have fun, just get into the duels – because that's what I can do the best.” Gwinn herself was named Best Young Player at the 2019 World Cup and has talked about sharing her “experience” with those in the team. She’s 23 years old. “I think with three years between the two tournaments, I think I got more confident,” she explained. “We have many young players, so I can maybe just give them something from my experience and just be happy to be back on the pitch after my [ACL] injury.” It’s no surprise, then, that they are the team to beat so far at the Euros. They have leadership, talent and belief throughout the squad, as well as a wonderful winning mentality and an ability to cope with pressure, having been under it so often with club and country. Combined, this is all going to be incredibly hard to stop. Denmark, the 2017 runners-up, tried and failed. Spain, the pre-tournament favourites for so many, tried and failed. Finland, who scored against the latter after less than a minute in their group-stage encounter, tried and failed. Next in line is Austria, a team that has 13 players in Germany’s domestic league. They know plenty about their opponent. They know their strengths and they know their weaknesses, as a team and as individuals. But it’s one thing to put a plan together to stop them, and another altogether to actually be able to do so.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/germany-eight-time-women-european-champions-written-off/blt2256cedf8f905f24,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

4355,Miedema signs new Arsenal contract to end talk of move to United States or Barcelona,"Vivianne Miedema has signed a contract extension at Arsenal that brings the speculation surrounding her future to a close. The prolific Dutch forward, whose current deal was set to expire this summer, has committed to fresh terms keeping her in north London. No announcement has been made on how long a new agreement will run for, but talk of an imminent switch to Barcelona or the US being made has been calmed for now. Miedema told the club’s official website: “I think the most beautiful thing about the game is building something with a team and with people around you that you really want to be around. “I do feel like I have got that at Arsenal. I feel like for me, winning titles with Arsenal will mean a lot more to me than winning them with another club at the moment. That's what I obviously hope to achieve with Arsenal.” Gunners boss Jonas Eidevall added: “Viv is a stellar talent and a hugely important player for this team, so it's fantastic news that she is staying with us. “As a club, our ambition is to win titles and compete at the highest level - we know Viv's own ambitions are the same, and together we will give everything to achieve that.” We’ve got some exciting news to share…@VivianneMiedema has signed a new contract ❤️ The Gunners were keen to avoid parting with the 25-year-old as she has been a revelation in English football. Well established as one of world football’s brightest stars, Miedema passed 100 goals for Arsenal during the 2021-22 campaign as she found the target on 23 occasions across all competitions. She is the leading scorer in Women Super League’s history with 72 goals, and in November 2021 became the first player to score against every team she has faced in top-flight competition. Miedema, who joined Arsenal from Bayern Munich in 2017, also had a temporary statue placed outside Emirates Stadium ahead of a north London derby in May as her remarkable achievements continue to be recognised. She has also won the WSL title and League Cup during her time with the Gunners.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/miedema-new-arsenal-contract-usa-barcelona/blt4f6800fe1926aba1,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

A star-studded side from France claimed five successive European crowns between 2015-16 and 2019-20, with nobody able to get close to matching the standards set in Decines-Charpieu. Catalan giants were, however, to make their way to the summit of continental football in 2020-21 – crushing English title winners Chelsea 4-0 in the final – and will not want to surrender that standing without a fight. An epic encounter at the Allianz Stadium in Turin is now ready to be played out, with GOAL delivering everything you need to know about to how watch a collection of superstars battle it out for the biggest prize in the women’s game.

An eagerly-anticipated encounter is due to get underway at 8pm BST in the United Kingdom and 3pm ET in the United States. Barcelona Femeni enjoyed a faultless run through the group stage of the 2022 Women’s Champions League, with 24 goals scored and only one conceded while collecting a maximum haul of 18 points from meetings with Arsenal, Hoffenheim and Koge. A Clasico clash with arch-rivals Real Madrid was then lined up at the quarter-final stage, with a comprehensive 8-3 aggregate success secured there. Barca then swept past Wolfsburg in the semi-finals, with a crushing Alexia Putellas-inspired 5-1 victory in the first leg of that last-four encounter – which was played out in front of a record-breaking crowd of 91,648 at Camp Nou - ensuring that a rare setback suffered in the return date counted for little in the grand scheme of things.

They did suffer one defeat, away at Bayern Munich, but eased into the last eight and put Juventus to the sword there after staging a stirring second leg fightback to prevail 4-3 on aggregate. Slightly easier work was made of a semi-final showdown with domestic rivals Paris Saint-Germain, but Sonia Bompastor’s side still had to dig deep in order to claim a 3-2 victory at home and a 2-1 win on the road.

4375,'All Of US: The U.S. Women's Soccer Show' reviews a rocky 2021 for the USWNT and NWSL,"If nothing else, it was an eventful year in American women's soccer. For the U.S. women's national team, 2021 started out with the promise of Olympic glory, but ended with a disappointing showing in Tokyo that saw them take home a bronze medal. In the NWSL, a year that promised a return to normal after a coronavirus-hit 2020 turned into a reckoning on the league's inability to protect players amid a series of abuse scandals. On this week's episode of 'All of US: The U.S. Women's Soccer Show', GOAL breaks down the year that was in American women's soccer. The USWNT were heavy favorites heading into the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics, but started out with a humbling 3-0 loss to Sweden and never fully returned to their world-beating best. The U.S. struggled throughout the tournament, but did manage to salvage a medal by defeating Australia in the third-place match after a stunning defeat to Canada in the semi-final. Following the Olympics, the USWNT bid farewell to an iconic figure, as Carli Lloyd played the final matches of her career. Lloyd's exit was symbolic as the U.S. turns the page on the year and looks forward to 2022, when they will aim to bring in some new blood while looking ahead to the 2023 World Cup. The NWSL was hoping for a return to normality in 2021 after a mostly lost season in 2020, but what transpired was anything but business as usual. The league was besieged by a number of scandals involving head coaches engaging in abusive behavior toward players, which was compounded by the lack of an adequate response from club executives and league officials. By the end of the season, five of the league's 10 coaches had been replaced due to inappropriate behavior. On the field, one of those five teams – the Washington Spirit – went on an incredible late-season run that saw them crowned league champions.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/all-of-us-womens-soccer-show-2021-uswnt-nwsl/bltc833e5775b60146d,Seth Vertelney,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

4451,How Hayes and Eidevall added extra spice to Chelsea and Arsenal's Women's Super League title fight,"Alongside its title races and trophy chases, English football has long had entertaining managerial rivalries off the pitch that have complemented the spectacle on it. The tension between Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson is iconic, while Jose Mourinho quickly became infamous for his off-the-pitch antics upon arriving in the Premier League. For a long time, that had yet to translate to the women’s game – for lots of reasons – but in the Women’s Super League this year, it has started to creep in and has added spice to a title race that will be concluded this Sunday, on the last day of the season. It will either be Emma Hayes’ Chelsea or Jonas Eidevall’s Arsenal that picks up the trophy, the pair separated by just one point in the former’s favour before the final fixtures. Eidevall took up his position with the club last summer and his first taste of the WSL was a home fixture with the Blues, the reigning champions, at the Emirates. It was a thrilling game, ending 3-2 to the Gunners. The caveat was that Chelsea’s line-up didn’t include Sam Kerr, Fran Kirby or Sophie Ingle – all of whom were involved in last summer’s Olympics and returned to England late as a result. Arsenal, however, did play their Olympians. “They had three weeks off,” Hayes said after being asked about the trio starting on the bench. “Arsenal gave their players no time off whatsoever. “It's a long season and the reason I say it's a long season is, yes, the advantage might be there today, but my job is to keep everybody on the pitch for the whole season.” Winning your first London derby at the Emirates. Love the passion, @eidevall 👏#BarclaysFAWSL @ArsenalWFC pic.twitter.com/IcbGYJtcUT After the game, in his own press conference, Eidevall said something Hayes would pick up on at a later date, too. ""The goals we scored, they have some similarities in them, right?” he explained. “I think those are the goals that you can score against Chelsea if they don't choose to be lower in defence. ""Today, they didn't choose that. That was the opportunity they were giving us to score goals. ""They don't like to sit low and defend. If they have any weakness, it's that. ""I think that was pretty clear when you saw the Champions League final against Barcelona, when they were forced to defend in long spells of the game. They get into problems."" A month later, his Arsenal team would be beaten 4-1 by Barca in a devastating performance from the European champions. Chelsea played out a 3-3 draw with Wolfsburg the next day and Hayes was asked about the Gunners’ game. ""I know Jonas felt that, from watching us against them, he understood why they beat us,” she responded. “I'm sure last night he understood why they beat them."" The pair met again in December’s delayed Women’s FA Cup final. Before the game, Eidevall had told the press he was superstitious about black cats. “If Emma sees this,” he laughed, “she will probably buy a thousand black cats with the money Chelsea have and send them all over our training pitch.” She didn’t – but she did use the information to entertain, nonetheless. At Wembley, Chelsea were much the better team, winning 3-0. “When the third goal went in, I was simply purring,” Hayes said, complete with a cat impression. Breaking: @emmahayes1 reacts to @samkerr1's second goal 🤣#WomensFACupFinal pic.twitter.com/Tl52BVLWOC There is the utmost respect between these two – something reiterated whenever they talk about one another in the media. There is no burning hatred. There’s no intensity like rivalries the Premier League has seen. But it has been another reason why this WSL title race has been so entertaining to watch unfold. Going into the final few games, with neither team having room to drop points, it has continued. Asked if he’d watched Chelsea’s narrow 2-1 win over Tottenham at the end of last month, a victory that kept them in control of the title with only two games to go, Eidevall replied: “I didn’t. “I didn’t focus on Chelsea when they were rearranging their fixtures in January so that Sam Kerr didn’t have to miss games because of the Asia Cup and I don’t focus on them now. “I focus on Arsenal getting as many points as possible and seeing where that gets us in the table.” “I don't care,” Hayes said a few days later when asked if she felt her adversary was playing mind games. “I'm too busy getting the team ready for the week. “I think it's great that there's a competitive rivalry between two teams. I hugely respect him and his team and the work they've done this year to push us all the way. ""I think Arsenal have had a tremendous season and quite rightly, they're going into the last game still contending to be champions. That's what we've wanted to see for the league. “I think as for the small talk, that's for you guys to comment on, not me.” The Chelsea boss has said throughout the season that these narratives are for the media, for the fans of the league to enjoy, and they are. They add even more intrigue to what has been a thrilling battle for the WSL title. It’s entertaining, it’s another element worth talking about and it generates further excitement. If the Blues beat Manchester United on Sunday, they will be champions for a third year in a row. They only need to match Arsenal’s result to keep the trophy. The Gunners, meanwhile, will focus on getting three points against West Ham while hoping United do them a favour. That could well happen, too. Marc Skinner’s side need to win to keep their chances of securing Women’s Champions League football alive, hoping for three points in London and a victory for Reading against Manchester City, too, to overcome the two-point deficit keeping them out of Europe at the moment. With that huge incentive, could we have another twist in this fantastic season? It would be quite the way to end what’s already been a captivating watch from all angles. We’ve had plenty of drama on the pitch and off the pitch for nine months as each episode of the WSL in 2021-22 has unfolded. Now it’s time for the season finale – and it’s unlikely to disappoint.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/hayes-eidevall-chelsea-arsenal-women-super-league-title/bltd73f532c9a41888c,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

4468,Jule Brand: Germany’s ‘very special’ teenage winger ready to trouble Arsenal in the Women's Champions League,"There were 60 minutes on the clock when Jule Brand came on for her senior international debut for Germany back in April. Two minutes later, with her first four touches of the ball, she broke through the Australia defence and slotted home her first senior international goal. Two minutes after that, she was through again – this time squaring a perfectly-weighted pass for Laura Freigang to score Germany’s fourth. Voted Player of the Match for her efforts, when asked how she felt after the game, she did not have the words. “Simply indescribable,” Brand said. “To be honest, I still can't believe what happened today.” That dream debut proved to be confirmation of Brand's talent that had been shining in the Frauen-Bundesliga with Hoffenheim since the beginning of the 2020-21 season. Brand’s introduction to the first team at Hoffenheim came a few months earlier, during the first Covid-19 lockdown in Germany. Then-head coach Jurgen Ehrmann had spotted her in the Under-17s and U20s – the latter of whom play in the second tier of German women's football – and was impressed. “She already stood out with her long strides, but back then it all looked a bit stalky and not as harmonious as today,” Ehrmann tells GOAL. “But the talent could not be overlooked, which is why we wanted her at Hoffenheim. In the U20 team, it became more and more apparent that she has very special skills. “Jule's style of play has always been very light-hearted, and then in the 2. Liga she learned a lot in tackling. She was able to gain a sense of achievement, which also boosted her self-confidence. Her skills became more and more noticeable, her technique and her speed, also with the ball. “In the first lockdown, she trained with the Bundesliga team for the first time - at first, we were only allowed to do so in small groups and without physical contact. Then we noticed that she is technically good and very advanced for her age. That's how she came into our focus and then also trained regularly with the Bundesliga team."" Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: At just 17 years old, Brand would make her Frauen-Bundesliga debut from the bench in a 3-1 defeat to Turbine Potsdam. From there, Ehrmann slowly, but surely, continued to introduce her into team. By the end of the 2020-21 campaign, she had started 15 league games and registered four goals and six assists. She had also made her international debut and helped Hoffenheim secure Women’s Champions League football for the first time. ""She has become even more dynamic and has also improved physically,” Ehrmann says, asked about what exposure to the top level has done to Brand’s game. “You never know what she's going to do next in the match. She has incredible speed with and without the ball. Especially with the ball, she has developed this strength even more. She has a better understanding of the game and also made great progress in the tactical area."" It was only a matter of time until Germany head coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg called Brand in for a camp. A handful of caps later and she was echoing Ehrmann’s thoughts. ""Jule sometimes doesn't even know what she can do yet,"" Voss-Tecklenburg said in November, after the winger scored once and assisted twice in Germany’s win over Turkey. ""She still has so much up her sleeve. If she stays healthy, we can look forward to a really, really great player in this German national team in the next few years."" It’s still less than 18 months since Brand made her first-team debut with Hoffenheim, but the way she has developed in that time has been excellent. She has already matched her goal tally this season in the league from last term, and has put her name on the scoresheet twice in the Champions League too. Exposure to big experiences like those in Europe will only aid her development. Despite Hoffenheim's defeat to Arsenal in October, many came out of the game singing her praises. As the German side face the difficult task of trying to secure a big win over the Gunners on Wednesday to qualify for the quarter-finals, the teenager will be key. Ehrmann believes there are areas where Brand can get even better – in her strength, her heading, her ability to use both feet – and given how he speaks of her character, there is little doubt she will apply herself to those tasks. “It's fun to coach her because you can see how much she enjoys it,” he adds. “She listens carefully and then tries to put it into practice. “She has always kept it fun. She plays with great joy. She is, nevertheless, very ambitious.” Combine that with her skillset, and Brand looks like she could achieve whatever her ambitions are in what is sure to be a wonderful career.

4491,Ji So-Yun to leave Chelsea Women at end of season,"South Korea international Ji So-Yun will leave Chelsea Women at the end of the season, the club have confirmed. Ji began her career in her homeland with INAC Kobe Leonessa in 2011 before joining Chelsea three years later, and has since become one of the most decorated players in the club's history. The midfielder has helped the Blues win 11 trophies in total while playing in over 200 games across all competitions, but will head back to South Korea when her contract expires in June. Ji sent a short message to supporters after her impending departure was confirmed on Friday, telling the club's official media channel: ""I just want to say, once a blue, always a Blue. Thank you."" Chelsea boss Emma Hayes has paid tribute to Ji for her outstanding performances in the Women's Super League over the past eight years and thanked her for helping to raise the team's global profile. ""What an honour and a privilege it’s been to coach one of the most amazing players the WSL has ever seen. There’s no question she’s been the most successful player from outside our league,"" said Hayes. ""Ji’s helped the club grow on and off the pitch and she’s a fabulous character who will be sorely missed. I will miss her terribly and I’m so grateful for everything she’s done for everyone at the football club. We are in a much better place because of it."" Once a Blue, always a Blue. 💙Ji So-Yun to depart Chelsea at the end of the season. Ji has scored 68 goals in 208 games for the Blues to date, including 37 in the WSL, which puts her among the highest scorers in the competition's history. The South Korean star has been a champion of England on five occasions and also has three FA Cup winners' medals, two Continental Cup successes and one Community Shield to her name - a haul she could well add to before her departure. Chelsea are sitting top of the WSL with only two matches of the 2021-22 campaign left to play, and also have an FA Cup final date against Manchester City to look forward to on May 15.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ji-so-yun-leave-chelsea-women/blt7cfbb8d2b7421df8,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4503,‘I think they have a great team’ – England star Toone predicts Spain to be toughest Arnold Clark Cup opponent,"England’s Ella Toone has said Spain may present her team’s most difficult test at this month’s Arnold Clark Cup. The inaugural tournament will begin on February 17, with Germany to face Spain in the day’s first fixture before the Lionesses take on Canada. But despite Canada being Olympic gold medallists, and Germany being eight-time European champions, it’s a Spain team on the rise that Toone believes will be “really tough”. Asked which team she believes will be the biggest threat for England at the tournament, Toone told media on Tuesday: “I think all teams are great opposition and teams that we can really test ourselves against, but I think Spain will be really tough. “The way they move the ball and their style of play is great to watch, so that will be a tough game. “Our focus is now on Canada, as that's our first game, so we'll prepare as best we can for that game, then the next and then the next. But I think Spain have a great team.” The Arnold Clark Cup is here!  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇪🇸🇨🇦🇩🇪 Ballon d'Or winner @alexiaputellas and the players that inspire the women’s game will be involved in the inaugural @arnoldclarkcup, February 17-23 🏆🔥Secure your tickets now!#ArnoldClarkCup pic.twitter.com/RAnFQO5O5T Toone knows the quality of one of Spain’s players all too well, as she plays her club football alongside full-back Ona Batlle. Asked about her Man Utd team-mate, the 22-year-old, who has six goals in her eight international appearances to date, described her as “an unbelievable player”. “[I] train with her every day in training and she's unbelievable. She's a great player on and off the ball,” she said. “We know that the Spain team have wonderful players and it's going to be tough. But our thoughts are, firstly, on Canada. “We know [Canada] are a great team. Since then [they beat us in a friendly last April], they've gone on to win the Olympics. “They've got loads of class players, unbelievable players. We'll look as a team on what areas we need to exploit. We'll work hard on our game as well and we'll do what we're good at and hopefully it will be a great game and we can pick up three points."" This month’s Arnold Clark Cup is not the only tournament England will host in 2022. This summer, the country will welcome Europe’s best for the UEFA Women’s Euro, and playing elite opposition over the next 10 days will be “really important” to prepare for that, Toone believes. “I think it’s the best preparation for us to play against really tough opponents, test ourselves against the best,” she said. “That will only help us in our build-up to the Euros. “This tournament’s great for us - perfect timing, perfect opponents to test ourselves against and it should be really exciting for us. “I’ve not played a lot of international football but in the games I have, we’ve won quite comfortably. These [games] will be really tough for everyone involved and for me especially. It will make me test myself against better opposition but that’s the same for the whole team.” Tickets to watch England, Germany, Spain and Canada play in the Arnold Clark Cup are available now.

4549,Arsenal Women to play boys' U16 team to make training 'more physical and faster' than Champions League games,"Arsenal Women's team will face the boys' Under-16s side to prepare them for the Champions League, manager Jonas Eidevall says. The Gunners finished runners-up in the Women's Super League this season, coming in one point behind champions Chelsea. Arsenal's final placement has secured a spot in next season's Champions League and Eidevall hopes coming up against the boys' side will help get them ready for the challenge in Europe. Eidevall told The Athletic: ""We have to have a good cooperation with our boys' academy to involve them in practices and internal games, so we can play against something more physical and faster than we will ever play against in the Champions League, in order to set the benchmark. ""That's an astonishing opportunity that most football teams around the world would give everything in order to do; to see if we can make our training harder than the games.  ""That means if we're successful in training, then we will for sure be successful in games as well. We'll have a little bit more time and it will be a little bit easier. ""That's more something to speak to [Arsenal boys' academy manager] Per Mertesacker with. U15 or U16 is usually a good age group where the physicality hasn't grown so much on all the players. They are a little faster than our players but it's not impossible to play against."" Arsenal became the first British team to win the Women's Champions League in the 2006-07 campaign. This season, the north London club reached the quarter-finals of the competition. They finished second in Group C behind Barcelona to progress to the knockout rounds, edging ahead of Hoffenheim based on the goal difference in their head-to-head record.

4575,Bayern captain & Germany international Magull calls for more courage to be shown in investing in women's football,"Bayern Munich captain Lina Magull has called on the German FA to do more for women's football, affirming that they need to show ""courage"" in order to make the game grow.  Magull lifted back-to-back Champions Leagues with Wolfsburg in 2012-13 and 2013-14 and more recently helped Bayern take the Bundesliga crown last season, their first title in five years.  Her talents have also been recognised at international, where she is a regular fixture in the Germany team.  ""Since the DFB is responsible for the women's Bundesliga, they obviously have a duty to ensure that everything goes more positively. But I also know that the association is making great efforts,"" the 27-year-old midfielder signalled to Spox. ""Ultimately, however, it is the facts that count. And the facts are unfortunately not as positive as we all imagined. It's a difficult business and then you need those responsible who can initiate the big steps.  ""There is little point in addressing things publicly but not initiating certain processes internally. Especially since the focus is still on the men's area and we are not treated equally there. Coronavirus also didn't play into our hands in such a way that the DFB could now go full throttle. ""Should the DFB have been more courageous? That would of course have been desirable, but I don't know exactly why. We only notice that it works well in other countries because people invest, because they are interested in women's football and because they see that it's worth it. ""I don't know why this is still such a problem in Germany. We players try our best, we're always evolving and that's why I don't understand why we don't have our full support, approach the issue properly and not just talk about it."" When asked whether she would consider lining up in the English Women's Super League, Magull acknowledged that she was open to the idea.  ""Of course it's a thought to gain international experience. This is definitely a beautiful life experience for you personally,"" she added. ""It would also be interesting to see how things are going abroad and whether everything is really as great as it is made out to be. I am well aware that all that glitters is not gold.  ""I'm also very happy in Germany, regardless of football. I see the state and especially the city of Munich as worth living in and I'm in a top club that still has a lot of potential. We have international players here, which speaks for us because we are interesting beyond Germany.  ""But I have still thought about going abroad from time to time. England was in talks but the country as such doesn't appeal to me as much as, for example, a southern [European] country.  ""I'm trying to look at what's best for my life overall. But it's important for me to emphasize that I like it very much in Germany and I hope that women's football will improve here.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bayern-captain-and-germany-international-magull-calls-for/bltd3876375be1bcab1,Daniel Edwards,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4618,Clyde terminate loan of ruled-as-rapist Goodwillie after Ladies team sever ties & striker is banned from entering stadium,"Clyde have terminated a loan deal for David Goodwillie after seeing their Ladies side look to sever ties with the club and North Lanarkshire Council ban the striker from entering the team's stadium. Raith Rovers sparked controversy by signing Goodwillie as a free agent on the final day of the January transfer window. After a fierce backlash against the arrival of the 32-year-old, who was ruled as a rapist by a civil court judge in 2017, the Scottish Championship outfit admitted they had ""got it wrong"" and looked to have offloaded him until the end of the season – although an agreement with Clyde is now being ripped up. A statement from the Scottish League One side released late on their official website on Thursday read: “The club are tonight in the process of terminating the loan agreement with Raith Rovers for David Goodwillie.” A spokesperson for North Lanarkshire Council said: “Should Mr Goodwillie enter the stadium, we will consider the contract to have been breached and we will take immediate steps to terminate it. In addition, we have informed Clyde FC that the council intends not to renew the lease with the club when the contract for the use of Broadwood Stadium expires in May 2023.” Goodwillie returned to Clyde for a second spell on Monday, with a short-term loan deal agreed that was due to see him remain at the club until June. Clyde Ladies moved quickly to end their association with the men's side of the club, confirming their decision in an official statement on their Facebook page. General manager David McGoldrick has also stepped down, with the statement reading: “All of the players in the ladies team have discussed the situation with the general manager/secretary and they are ALL in agreement that we no longer wish to play for Clyde FC. This will start with immediate effect. “As a group of female footballers all we wish to do is play the sport that we love, but due to the current circumstances we are unable to do this.” Raith Rovers’ women's team took the same steps as Clyde when Goodwillie joined their club, and renamed themselves after Val McDermid - a devoted fan that stepped in to fund new kits for the team. They now compete under the new name of McDermid Ladies, and Clyde's outgoing ladies team have reportedly already contacted them for advice on their next move. “We are happy to offer our support and share our experiences,” McDermid Ladies head coach Neil Sinclair said. “We don’t condone violence against women, so it is good to see other teams sharing those morals and perspective.” McDermid herself has also provided the Clyde Ladies squad with some public words of support, adding: ""I wish the Clyde Ladies the very best of luck. ""I think the world has changed in the last five years. The societal acceptance of violence against women has shifted quite considerably. And what would have been a very difficult thing for them to do before has become something that is more possible now. “With all social movements you need someone to kick the door open and the McDermid Ladies have kicked the door open and the sky didn’t fall in. “The women at Clyde will have seen the breadth of positive response to what happened at Raith and will have been heartened by that.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/clyde-ladies-general-manager-and-players-quit-after-men-s/bltccf3ce0ea01d7dcc,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4632,"More international goals than Ronaldo & Messi: Meet Christine Sinclair, Canada's record-breaking star","Cristiano Ronaldo's brace against the Republic of Ireland in 2021 made him the greatest international goalscorer in men's football, overtaking Iran's Ali Daei. Ronaldo has scored 128 times in 205 games for his country, three of those in his nation's triumphant Euro 2016 campaign and eight coming at World Cup finals. However, in order to become football's all-time top international goalscorer, Ronaldo needs to chase down the incredible tally of Christine Sinclair. Christine Sinclair is a forward, primarily playing as an attacking midfielder, who is the captain of the Portland Thorns and also held that position with the Canada women's national team until her retirement from international football in December 2023. The 40-year-old has played in North America her whole career, selected by FC Gold Pride as the eighth overall pick in the 2008 Women's Professional Soccer (WPS) expansion draft after starring for the Portland Pilots while attending university. She moved to Western New York Flash in 2011 and then joined the Thorns two years later, for the inaugural National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) season, where she has remained ever since.  Sinclair played at six World Cup finals and three Olympic Games for her country, winning two bronze medals and, in 2021, that elusive gold medal. She won the WPS Championship twice, has lifted the NWSL Championship on three occasions, claimed the NWSL Challenge Cup in 2021 and is widely regarded as Canada's greatest player of all time. Sinclair ended her international career with a world-record 190 goals in 331 games for Canada. She set a new international goalscoring record in January 2020, scoring her 184th and 185th international goals against St Kitts and Nevis in the CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifying Championship. ""Thank you to everyone for all the messages. I'm slightly overwhelmed,"" she posted on Twitter afterwards. ""Thank you to all my teammates, coaches, staff, friends and family, 185 would not have been possible without you."" The previous record was held by Abby Wambach, the former U.S. women's national team striker who twice won Olympic gold and also won the FIFA Women's World Cup. Wambach scored 184 goals in 255 games for her country before retiring in 2015. As well as being her country's all-time top goalscorer, Sinclair won more caps (331) for Canada than anyone else, male or female. That total puts her second on the list of the most capped players of all-time, only behind former U.S. women's national team star Kristine Lilly (354). Sinclair went to the World Cup a record number of five times as a captain and scored at five different tournaments, a record she shares with Marta. The forward previously held the record for most goals scored in a single Olympic women's football tournament, too, netting six at London 2012, but that record was broken by Vivianne Miedema at the Games in 2021. Sinclair is the only person to have won the Bobbie Rosenfeld Award more than once, a prestigious accolade given to Canada's female athlete of the year, and has been named Canadian Player of the Year an incredible 14 times. Sinclair retired from international football in December 2023, with Australia visiting Canada for a pair of send-off friendlies for the iconic forward on December 1 and December 5. Sinclair announced her decision on October 20, writing on Instagram: ""I suppose it will be fitting to end this thing the same way it started - with some tears, playing the game we love on some field in Vancouver."" The 40-year-old also revealed that she will not be hanging up her boots just yet though, as she has committed to playing at club level with the Portland Thorns for at least one more year. There are currently five women's players who have more international goals than Ronaldo. Those women are the U.S. women's national team quartet of Lilly (130), Lloyd (134), Mia Hamm (158) and Wambach (184) then topped by Sinclair. Lionel Messi, meanwhile, recently became just the third player in the history of men's football to score 100 international goals. He is now only behind Ronaldo and Daei, having become the first South American to hit a century. *Note statistics correct as of December 5, 2023",https://www.goal.com/en/news/more-international-goals-ronaldo-messi-meet-christine/1a6r50m8soq0m1poy7jit38uwq,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

A memorable campaign for the Catalan giants has seen them send records tumbling, with a Primera Division title secured without dropping a point while history was made when packing out Camp Nou for European encounters. However they suffered a rare setback in continental competition when lining up against fellow heavyweights from France, with Putellas still coming to terms with an agonising 3-1 defeat in Turin. Posting on Instagram the day after more major silverware slipped through Barcelona’s grasp, Putellas said: “Today is a day that is hard to get up with energy to assimilate everything that happened. “It’s complicated and hard, very hard; but at the same time I am fully confident that we will have another chance again. “We weren’t okay at the time we needed to be the most. We know this and we will analyse, work and improve with the utmost humility, as is necessary after each match. “With the falls and defeats we have become stronger and what happened will help us continue to write our history. “The most painful thing of all is not being able to give you great joy after the efforts you have made to accompany us to Turin and all the support you have given us all season. We owe you one. “I am very proud to be part of this team. Being from Barca is the best thing there is.” Having already captured a domestic crown and the Supercopa de Espana this season, Barcelona were hoping to complete a clean sweep in 2021-22.

Oliver comes to the club after spending six seasons with Barcelona, where he was in charge of generating revenue from all of the club's facilities, excluding merchandising.  With Miami, Oliver will lead the club's ticketing and facilities departments as the club looks forward to opening its new stadium in 2025. The longtime executive, who has 20 years of experience in La Liga, spent the last six years as the FC Barcelona Stadium and Museum Revenue Director, putting him in charge of all of the club's facilities.  Oliver, who departed Barca earlier this year, worked across different sports, including both the men's and women's soccer teams, basketball, handball, futsal and roller hockey, while also being in charge of the club's museum, food and beverage and events. During his time at Barca, the club had their highest-ever revenue gain while generating more stadium profits than any other club in Europe. Barca opened several new facilities during Oliver's tenure, including the Barca Cafe, while the club's museum had the highest revenue of any sports museum in the world.  Barca also finished first in the Deloitte Money league and had the highest revenue ever for a soccer club, with €200m of that coming from Oliver's sectors. ""Coming to Miami, there are some really interesting things happening here,"" Oliver told GOAL. ""So it's like building this team and making it grow and making this big. ""Of course, being here and having the World Cup here in Miami, the new Miami Freedom Park, everything. This made me want to come here. Hey, it's going to be a great experience."" One of Oliver's biggest tasks will be setting the stage for Miami's move to the club's stadium, which is scheduled to occur in 2025. In the spring, the club was given final approval by the city to build a stadium, ending an extended process that saw numerous locations discussed.  Oliver was quick to stress that the club's current facilities are great and that he has two goals for the coming years.  The first is to bring more people to the stadium and drive up ticket sales at the club's current home DRV-PNK Stadium.  The second is making sure the new stadium is ready by the time the big move happens. ""It's really exciting to be a part and to have a big role here in defining the new stadium,"" he said. ""To be honest, without Miami Freedom Park, probably the offer wouldn't be so interesting!  ""There's everything here. Everything I did before in terms of food and beverage, in terms of selling tickets, in terms of selling season ticket members, but there's also the new stadium and there's also trying to create a very commercial stadium and a very great fun experience all the time and make fans come again and again and again and to generate more money."" Oliver continued: ""I want fans to have a great experience in general. I feel there's not as much passion yet in MLS as in Europe, and I would like to generate anything to have this passion. ""The last game here was was great, scoring two goals at the last minute and seeing the people having this feeling. I like to help everyone here too, to have this feeling forever.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/inter-miami-hire-ex-barcelona-executive-as-club-looks/blta29ca9bef6a09fc1,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

4697,From hiring Barcelona's treble-winning coach to bidding for the Euros: Ukraine turning heads in women's football,"When former Barcelona manager Lluis Cortes was announced as the new head coach of Ukraine’s women’s national team, it was quite a surprise. A nation ranked 35th in the world that has only qualified for one major tournament, it’s not where many expected the Spaniard to land after leaving Barca, whom he led to an historic treble last season. But this isn’t the first time that Ukraine has turned heads in the women’s game in recent months. Just a few days before Cortes' appointment, the Ukrainian Association of Football (UAF) announced its interest in hosting the 2025 UEFA Women’s Euros. Then, Zhytlobud-1 Kharkiv, the county’s representatives in this year’s Women’s Champions League group stages, beat Icelandic side Breidablik to put Ukraine in pole position to secure another UWCL spot from the 2023-24 season on. Ukraine are clearly taking plenty of positive steps forward, and it seems that there are plenty more to come. Asked how the headline-grabbing move came about, Cortes tells GOAL it was “a personal goal” of Andriy Pavelko, the UAF president: “He wanted the best coach for the national team and to build this project.” That project is to help develop the women’s game in the country while fulfilling his coaching duties, the kind of dual-role with which he is familiar after his time in Catalonia. Yesterday we celebrated the 30th anniversary of the @uafukraine 🟡🔵 A pleasure to be able to help this wonderful country to develop women's football in the years to come💪🏻 @uafwomen .🔵🟡 #UAF #Ukraine #uafwomen #УАФ #ЖіночийФутбол #lluiscortes #LCcoach #LC pic.twitter.com/1ajQILEq0t “I will try to do the same, but in a very big scenario,"" he says. “The association is very ambitious in women's football. [It] wants to improve, I want to improve and the most important thing is that players also want to improve. ""It's a good mix that if we work together, we can reach something really good.” That ambition hasn’t just emerged in the last few months either. Three years ago, Kyiv hosted the UWCL final and Sergey Novikov, the deputy head of women’s football at the UAF, believes that that event provoked “change”. “Many presidents, officials and ordinary fans watched this action and realised that women's football has a right to exist,” Novikov tells GOAL. “Also, more and more girls saw that there is something to strive for and many began to have their own goal – to become a professional footballer.” Around the same time, Pavelko implemented a new strategy aimed at ensuring that all men’s clubs would work with a women’s team. “It gives the opportunity for new clubs and new schools to open all over Ukraine,” Valentyna Kotyk, head coach of Zhytlobud-1, says. Those changes at the top level are filtering down. Kotyk explains that Zhytlobud-1 have ambitions to build a new stadium for the women’s team and a new school for girls in football. “Taking into account the plans of the president of the club, we understand that we have a lot [of work] ahead of us,” she adds. Ganna Voronina, a forward for both Zhytlobud-1 and the national team, has noticed the impressive job her clab has done with its UWCL fixtures too. In the first round of group games, no match had a bigger crowd than the Ukrainian side's meeting with Real Madrid. Zhytlobud-1's profile has also increased massively across its social channels. “It’s due to the advertisement all over the city,” Voronina tells GOAL. “People know about this Champions League and our success. ""They follow our games. Because we play in the middle of the city, people have this opportunity to come and visit the games."" Rapid progress is being made but Ukraine still has a lot of ground to make up on more established nations. “I feel like the country is now like we were in Spain maybe 10-15 years ago,” Cortes says. “It's true that we are far from other big countries where women's football is more popular, but it's true also that we can improve it. “The first thing we have to start to change is the mentality of people. People must understand that today, a girl or a woman playing football should be normal. “It's the most important step because after that, you will get more sponsors, you will get more supporters, you will get more of everything around women's football.” There are more measurable steps that Cortes outlines, too. “One is to increase the number of young girls playing football,” he explains. ""The second is to improve the level of the Premier League, because this will also increase the level of the national team. “Also, we have to increase the promotion of women's football. We have to make it so that more people speak about women's football in Ukraine. ""That will bring in more sponsors and it will create a bigger budget for the clubs and for the teams, to make their job better and better. “There are some tournaments, like the Champions League, where we can show our teams in Ukraine to Europe. ""If we improve the level of the league, the participation of these clubs in the Champions League will be better. Everything is connected, but we have to work a lot.” Progress will be aided by big moments like the Champions League final in 2018, like Zhytlobud-1’s performances in this year’s competition. Hosting the Euros in 2025 is another a huge possible opportunity. What impact could that have? “It will give an even greater impetus to development,” Novikov says. “After all, women's football of the highest quality will be seen in many cities of our country. ""Thousands of people will be involved in the organisation. Hundreds of thousands of fans will come to Ukraine.” These possibilities are exciting and there is a real positive attitude within Ukrainian women’s football, but there is also realism. When GOAL asks Voronina what she, as a player, thinks are the biggest steps the country has taken in the women’s game, she says: “Women’s football in Ukraine is at a stage where it is at the start of its development. ""I think it will require a minimum of 10 years to be fully recognised and this question will be answered really.” There is no outlandish aim to win the next World Cup or the Champions League next season. It’s about making the most of the momentum that's clearly building within the women's game in Ukraine. The UAF and the country's clubs are evidently intent on doing just that. Cortes’ appointment is an eye-catching move, but it’s not Ukraine's first. “The association had a plan before I started with them,” he says. “This plan was to recognise the real situation of the association. Now, with me, we have to build the road to reach these goals.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-treble-winning-coach-hoping-host-euros-ukraine-turning-/blt6d5f8f556692fd02,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4712,Chelsea takeover: Boehly-led consortium's £4.25bn bid gets UK government & Premier League approval,"The sale of Chelsea to a consortium led by American billionaire Todd Boehly has been approved by the UK government and the Premier League as Roman Abramovich's 19 years running the west London club moves closer to its end. The total investment will cost £4.25 billion ($5.2bn), with £2.5bn ($3.2bn) ending up being the sale price of the club, while there is an agreement in place that £1.75bn (2.1$bn) will be invested over 10 years.  The purchase agreement was signed a fortnight ago and has been waived through by the Premier League Owners' and Directors' test, while the government has now facilitated the financial transaction.  ""The Premier League Board has today approved the proposed takeover of Chelsea Football Club by the Todd Boehly / Clearlake Consortium,"" the league said in a statement. ""The purchase remains subject to the Government issuing the required sale licence and the satisfactory completion of the final stages of the transaction. ""The Board has applied the Premier League’s Owners’ and Directors’ Test (OADT) to all prospective Directors, and undertaken the necessary due diligence. ""The members of the Consortium purchasing the club are affiliates of the Clearlake Capital Group, L.P., Todd Boehly, Hansjorg Wyss and Mark Walter. ""Chelsea FC will now work with the relevant Governments to secure the necessary licences to complete the takeover."" UK sports and culture minister Nadine Dorrie has confirmed that the government issued the special licence Chelsea require to complete the sale on Tuesday night. ""Last night the Government issued a licence that permits the sale of Chelsea FC. Given the sanctions we placed on those linked to Putin and the bloody invasion of Ukraine, the long-term future of the club can only be secured under a new owner,"" Dorrie said in a statement on social media. ""We are satisfied the proceeds of the sale will not benefit Roman Abramovich or other sanctioned individuals.  ""I want to thank everyone, especially officials who’ve worked tirelessly to keep the club playing and enable this sale, protecting fans and the wider football community."" Boehly is the co-owner of Major League Baseball's (MLB) Los Angeles Dodgers and a minority investor in the National Basketball Association (NBA) team LA Lakers.  He tried to buy Chelsea in 2019 for £2.2bn ($2.7bn) only to see his offer rejected. He has publicly stated his interest in buying a Premier League team and will become the face of this bid.  Boehly is expected to take a seat on the board and a guiding role despite only having a minority stake.  The majority of the money has been put up by Clearlake Capital with both the private equity firm's co-founders José E. Feliciano and Behdad Eghbali to be involved. Mark Walter, who is the principal owner of the Dodgers, is also involved, along with Boehly's long-term associate and fellow billionaire Hansjorg Wyss.  In non-executive board and advisory roles are Danny Finkelstein, the Times columnist and Tory peer, along with Barbara Charone, who is a PR executive in London.  The Blues will no longer be a loss-making operation with Roman Abramovich pumping in £1.5bn ($1.9bn) of his personal wealth to keep the club's lavish spending going.  That's not to say the new owners won't invest, having done so in the past with their other sports teams, but will look to increase revenues to ensure the books are balanced.  It will be more akin to a Liverpool-style model with data driving many decisions at the club.  They have also agreed to invest in Stamford Bridge, the academy, the Women’s Team and Kingsmeadow (women's team stadium) and continued funding for the Chelsea Foundation. Boehly is thought to have a detailed plan for the first team stadium to bring it to the level of the top European football stadia.  Tuchel will ask for central defenders initially and Boehly's group intends to renew contracts for key players including Mason Mount and Reece James.  The proceeds of the sale will be deposited in a frozen UK bank account with Abramovich communicating his intention to donate 100% of it to charity.  The UK Government had to provide approval for the funds in the account to be transferred due to his status as a sanctioned individual.  It comes after allegations from the Government that he holds a close association with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  There still needs to be checks at European Union (EU) level and in Portugal because Abramovich holds a Portuguese passport, but it is expected to be waived through.

4733,UEFA bans Russia from women's Euros and World Cup as clubs remain barred from European competition,"UEFA has confirmed that Russian teams will be barred from European competitions next season as the governing body handed down further sanctions on Monday. In February, the organisation banned all Russian clubs and the national team from participating in UEFA competitions ""until further notice"" as a result of  the country's invasion of Ukraine. Due to ongoing conflict has resulted in Russian representatives being forced out of competition yet again. The Russian men's, women's and Under 21s teams will all be denied entry into European competitions next season. UEFA has confirmed that Russia will not be allowed to play in the Nations League and will be ranked fourth and subsequently relegated from Group 2 of League B. Furthermore, UEFA confirmed that the women's team ""will not participate in group C of the UEFA Women’s EURO 2022 final tournament"" in England this year. Instead, they will be replaced by Portugal, the team that Russia eliminated in the play-offs. Russia's women's team will also not be allowed to finish their qualifying campaign for the 2023 World Cup. Similarly, the U21s will not finish the qualifying stage of the upcoming European Championship. There will once again be no Russian clubs in the Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League next season. ""Russia will have no affiliated clubs participating in UEFA club competitions in the 2022/23 season,"" a statement from UEFA confirmed.  ""Consequently, the respective access lists of the men’s and women’s club competitions have been rebalanced in accordance with the principles set out in the relevant competition regulations. ""Furthermore, Russia will be assigned a number of coefficient points equivalent to the lowest number they have earned in any of the last five seasons, i.e. 4.333 points for the men’s association club coefficient and 1.750 for the women’s association club coefficient for the purpose of points calculation for the 2022/23 season."" Russia had come forward as potential hosts for the 2028 and 2032 European Championship competitions. However, UEFA has decided not to entertain their bid, saying: ""The UEFA Executive Committee declared the bid submitted by the Football Union of Russia (FUR) to host the UEFA EURO 2028 or the UEFA EURO 2032 as not eligible, in accordance with Article 16.02 of the Bid Regulations UEFA Finals and Final Phases which states that “each bidder shall ensure that it does not act in a manner that could bring UEFA, the UEFA final or UEFA final phase, any other bidder (or any employee, officer or representative of any of the foregoing), the bidding procedure or European football into disrepute"".""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uefa-bans-russia-from-women-s-euros-and-world-cup-as-clubs/blt9ce3b0814dc5e458,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

That’s our clear goal for the tournament. “We’re buzzing to take on three of the world’s best sides at home. Canada are reigning Olympic champions, Spain have some outstanding players in their squad, and obviously it doesn’t get much bigger an occasion than England v Germany. “It’s a special opportunity to play world-class opposition in front of our supporters, so we’ll be determined to be firing on all cylinders.” Spain coach Jorge Vilda added: “For Spain it is a great honour to participate in the first edition of the Arnold Clark Cup alongside world-class teams such as England, Germany and Canada. “In addition, visiting England in the year of the Euro will give us the opportunity to better prepare our participation in the tournament. We are very much looking forward to playing in England in February and hope to see a great show in all of the matches.” All of England’s games at the Arnold Clark Cup are set to be broadcast in the UK on ITV, while over half of all tickets for the event are priced at £10 or less.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-women-canada-germany-spain-arnold-clark-cup/bltfab68cbda037f43f,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4739,Rapinoe blasts 'sad and cruel' US Supreme Court for abortion ruling as Roe v Wade is overturned,"Megan Rapinoe has blasted the decision to overturn Roe v Wade - the ruling that protects a women's right to abortion - as ""sad and cruel"", with the USWNT star roundly blasting the U.S. Supreme Court. The nine-body panel - the highest legal court in the United States - ruled 5-4 in the Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization case on Friday, effectively overriding the prior case that has safeguarded women's rights for half-a-century. With more than half of the country's states expected to swiftly impose bans upon abortion in the coming weeks, the move has been met with widespread condemnation and anger - and Rapinoe, a frequent spokesperson on civil rights within the USWNT set-up, did not hold back in her assessment of the seismic decision. ""It's hard to put into words how sad a day this is for me personally, for my team-mates, for just all of the people out there who this is going to affect,"" Rapinoe stated during an impassioned press conference. ""I say this all the time - pro-choice means you get to choose. ""Pro-choice allows other people to be pro-life if that is what works for them, or that is what their beliefs are, or if that is where they are at in their life. Pro-life doesn't allow anybody to make a choice. I would encourage people to understand all of the different aspects that overturning Roe vs. Wade will have on  so many - in fact, everyone in the country. ""I just can't understate how sad and cruel it is, because this is not pro-life by any means. This way of thinking, or political belief, is coupled with a complete lack of motivation around gun laws, it comes with pro-death penalty, it comes with anti-healthcare, anti-prenatal care, anti-childcare, anti-pre-K, anti-food assistance, anti-welfare, anti-education, anti-maternity leave, anti-paternity leave."" Rapinoe further expressed her frustration that the right to abortion was even something up for debate, highlighting that the U.S. Supreme Court - with its two-to-one male-to-female ratio - is unqualified to make such a call too. ""There are an infinite amount of reasons why a woman chooses to do what she does with her body, or what they do with their body, none of which are anybody else's business,"" she added. ""The makeup of the court is ill-equipped to handle this kind of decision. ""Frankly, a male-majority court making decisions about my body or any other woman's body is completely misguided and wildly out of touch with the desires of the country, the will of the country and the will of the people. I think [they're] acting incredibly irresponsibly and inappropriately.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rapinoe-blasts-sad-cruel-us-supreme-court-for-abortion-roe-v/bltfc3759c43e077d69,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

4757,2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup: How many teams have conducted their leagues in the last two years?,"The 20th edition of the AFC Women's Asian Cup is all set to kick off on January 20 in India with China taking on Chinese Taipei in the opening game.  12 teams including the hosts will take part in the Asian Cup. Japan are the defending champions.  However, preparations haven't been ideal in the last couple of years for the teams after the pandemic distupted the footballing calendars. Out of the 12 participating teams, eight managed to conduct their local leagues in the recent past. Only India, Myanmar, Philippines and Indonesia were unable to conduct their respective domestic leagues due to the ongoing pandemic. In the 2020/21 season, almost every country had to either cut short their leagues or change the format in order to reduce the number of matches. This was done as most tournaments had to be conducted in a centralised venue or held within a short span of time. But in 2021/22, the situation went back to normalcy in most countries. The longest league, in terms of number of matches, was Japan's WE League where 110 matches were played. In South Korea's WK League, 84 matches are played. Compared to these, only 33 matches were played in India's premier domestic competition - IWL. Here, we take a look at the Asian Cup participants and how their domestic league was conducted in the last two years.

Russia have been removed from World Cup 2022 play-offs as a result – where they were due to face Poland on March 24 - as well as this summer’s European Women’s Football Championship in England, but how long will their absence last and when will they return to major events? GOAL takes a look… FIFA and UEFA announced in a joint-statement on February 28 that action was being taken against Russia, saying: “Following the initial decisions adopted by the FIFA Council and the UEFA Executive Committee, which envisaged the adoption of additional measures, FIFA and UEFA have today decided together that all Russian teams, whether national representative teams or club teams, shall be suspended from participation in both FIFA and UEFA competitions until further notice. “These decisions were adopted by the Bureau of the FIFA Council and the Executive Committee of UEFA, respectively the highest decision-making bodies of both institutions on such urgent matters. “Football is fully united here and in full solidarity with all the people affected in Ukraine. “Both presidents hope that the situation in Ukraine will improve significantly and rapidly so that football can again be a vector for unity and peace amongst people.” No definitive date has been set for the lifting of those sanctions, with Russia currently banned from FIFA and UEFA competition – such as the World Cup, Euros, Champions League and Europa League – indefinitely, while St Petersburg has been stripped of Champions League final hosting duties in 2022 as that contest instead heads to Stade de France in Paris on May 28. FIFA and UEFA have suspended Russian clubs and national teams from all competitions. pic.twitter.com/FLwMlWne4H Russia have lodged an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the FIFA and UEFA-imposed sanctions, with the respective federations of Poland, Sweden, the Czech Republic, England and a number of other nations being dragged into the process. The Russia Football Union (RFU) said: “The RFU will demand the restoration of all men's and women's national teams of Russia in all types of football in the tournaments in which they took part (including in the qualifying round of the World Cup in Qatar), as well as compensation for damage. “In order to ensure the possibility of the participation of Russian teams in the next scheduled matches, the RFU will insist on an expedited procedure for considering the case.” Upon receiving an official appeal from Russia, CAS has stated that it intends to deliver a final ruling on the case as quickly as possible, with competitive fixtures of considerable note fast approaching. A statement from CAS read: “The FIFA appeal has been filed against Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), the Polish Football Association, the Swedish Football Association, the Czech Football Association, the Football Association of Montenegro and the Malta Football Association. “The UEFA appeal has been filed against UEFA, the Hellenic Football Federation, the Belarus Football Federation, the Danish Football Association, the Luxembourgish Football Association, the Austrian Football Association, the Malta Football Association, the Portuguese Football Federation, the English Football Association, the Spanish Football Association, the Irish Football Association and the French Football Association. “In its appeals, the FUR requests CAS to set aside the Challenged Decisions and to reinstate all Russian teams and clubs for participation in FIFA and UEFA competitions. Together with each statement of appeal, the FUR has also filed a request to stay the execution of each challenged decision. “The CAS Court Office has initiated two separate arbitration procedures and, in accordance with the Code of Sports-related Arbitration (the arbitration rules governing CAS procedures), will seek the position of the respondent parties with respect to the FUR’s requests to stay the execution of the Challenged Decisions and as to the organization and planning of each arbitration procedure.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/when-russian-teams-allowed-compete-fifa-uefa-competitions/blt94268f1219b93340,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4769,What a final! Chelsea's FA Cup triumph proves women's game is past point of pandering,"When Chelsea midfielder Erin Cuthbert rifled the ball towards the goal of Manchester City’s Ellie Roebuck on Sunday afternoon, there was a collective gasp around Wembley Stadium. It struck the underside of the crossbar and nestled wonderfully into the back of the net, giving the Blues the lead in the game. Until Hayley Raso’s equaliser in the final minute of the 90, it looked like it would secure the Blues their fourth Women’s FA Cup trophy, too. It would be Emma Hayes’ side that came out on top after extra time still, with Sam Kerr’s second goal of the afternoon firing Chelsea to their second title in seven days, after the Women’s Super League triumph last Sunday. It was another brace on another big day from the sensational Aussie. But as this thrilling game was going on – a game that also included an incredible strike from City’s Lauren Hemp and splace on the scoresheet for Kerr for the fourth domestic cup final in succession – frustration was bubbling across social media. For all this that was happening, it wasn’t always the football that was the focal point in the coverage. CHELSEA WIN BACK-TO-BACK WOMEN'S FA CUPS! 🏆🏆 pic.twitter.com/eMlBLNsPv9 “[The] women's game must also break from the shackles of every broadcast having discussions about growth of the women's game,” Arsenal legend Ian Wright took to Twitter to say at half time. “The football in this game has been brilliant. Talk about [it]. So many incidents and tactical battles out there.” It’s one big thing that the women’s game is tussling with as it continues to grow is that talk of that progress often overshadows the game itself. Record attendances, viewing figures and games at big stadiums with lots of exposure are great for the sport, of course. But one of the big ways that growth can continue is simply by, when it comes down talking about an FA Cup final in itself, focusing on the football. The battle between Georgia Stanway and Cuthbert in midfield was excellent to watch – two terrier-like footballers going head-to-head to try and control possession for their teams. Watching Hemp, one of the best players in the country this season, take on Chelsea defender Jess Carter, the England international who has had a stellar campaign herself, was a treat. Seeing Chloe Kelly, the young England winger, out on the Wembley pitch just a year after a heart-breaking ACL injury ruled her out of the Olympic Games, and playing well, was wonderful. Seeing Ji So-yun, arguably the greatest foreign player ever to grace the Women’s Super League, play her final game for Chelsea was an ‘I was there’ moment. Sam Kerr coming up clutch for Chelsea yet again 🔥 pic.twitter.com/7DhLEWqXzs There was certainly no lack of things to talk about from a football perspective in a fixture that Chelsea manager Emma Hayes described as always being “a chess match”, beforehand. It certainly panned out that way, too. It’s not a new problem the sport faces. It’s been something it has grappled with for a while now. But if nearly 50,000 people are turning up for an FA Cup final, is the game really still in a stage of talking about how great that is? ""The one thing for me is that I'd like to see everybody - like [the media] - just talk about the football,” Jess Fishlock, the OL Reign midfielder told reporters when she was in England on loan at Reading last season. The Wales international, a stalwart of the NWSL in the United States, had noted the steps the WSL still needed to take and was elaborating on her point. Her words came to mind again on Sunday. “That would help take [the WSL] to the next level. I think we talk too much about the men's club is investing in the women or the women's crowds. I'd like to see everyone take the surround sound away and focus on the football. “What's the tactics? Just talk about football. I think that would take the game naturally to the next level. “I don't think we need to pander around anymore. Women's football is a high level product and I think we need to focus on that far more than the other stuff. I think that time has gone."" Sunday’s final was a thrilling conclusion to the domestic season in England. It has had a title race that went down to the wire and a dramatic final day to go with it, it witnessed a fantastic Continental Cup final between Chelsea and City in March and Wembley was treated to another cracker this time, too. When there are jaw-dropping moments on the pitch, why should anything else be the focus?",https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-a-final-chelsea-s-fa-cup-triumph-proves-women-s-game-is/blt3a49f4e6efb8505d,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4772,Barca’s UWCL rout of Wolfsburg keeps perfect 'invincible' season on track while underlining big problems in Germany,"“If you look at the economic possibilities of clubs from England or Spain, there won't be a Champions League winner from Germany in the short term,” Ralf Kellerman, the sporting director of Wolfsburg and the man who coached the club to two successive Women’s Champions League titles in 2013 and 2014, told GOAL before his team’s clash with Barcelona. That might have seemed pessimistic to some, but what played out in the first leg of this UWCL semi-final on Friday night at another record-breaking, sold-out Camp Nou illustrated everything he was talking about. As Barca ran out 5-1 winners, the gap between these two sides was glaringly on show. That’s not through any fault of Wolfsburg’s, but more a sign of how the women’s game has changed in the last few years. Going into this fixture, the German side had a perfect record against the reigning European champions: three games, three wins, no goals conceded. Their last meeting came in the semi-finals of the 2019-20 UWCL, when they ran out 1-0 victors. That day, Fridolina Rolfo was the match-winner. On Friday, she was playing again – but not in the green of Wolfsburg. With less than three minutes on the board, it was her quick thinking from a free-kick that set Aitana Bonmati through on goal to put the hosts in the lead. The second goal was salt in the wounds for Wolfsburg, too. It was Caroline Graham Hansen this time on the scoresheet, leaving Joelle Wedemeyer on the ground as she found the far corner. The Norwegian has arguably been the best winger in the world for several years now, a spell that began when she was at Wolfsburg. When she left Germany for Spain back in 2019, it raised eyebrows. Barca had just reached the UWCL final, but they were humbled by an incredible Lyon side, while Wolfsburg remained the French giants' biggest rival in Europe. It was a sign of the project being built in Catalunya and the ambition that they had. In the three years since, Barca have gone from strength to strength. When a club the size of Barcelona is taking its women’s football project seriously, and doing things properly, it can only lead to success. The most dominant side in world football 💪 pic.twitter.com/CDmc7MLXMN Meanwhile, the departures of players like Graham Hansen and Rolfo show how difficult things have become for Wolfsburg and for German women’s football. Though the summer signing of Jill Roord from Arsenal was an example of the pull that this illustrious club still has, Wolfsburg’s philosophy has had to become one of signing young players or players taking that next step in their careers, while others in Europe have more financial means. It is a strategy that has served them well. After all, Wolfsburg are in pole position in the Frauen-Bundesliga title race and are in the DFB-Pokal final, both at the expense of Bayern Munich. However, when players are moving to rival clubs in the UWCL and putting in performances against you like Rolfo and Graham Hansen did on Friday, there is a problem. Lina Magull, the Germany international midfielder who triumphed in Europe with Wolfsburg in 2013 and is now at Bayern, spoke to GOAL and SPOX last month about the issues in Germany. “It's a difficult business, and you need those responsible to take the big steps,” she said. “There's little point in talking about things in public but not initiating certain processes internally. “Especially since the focus is still on the men's sector and we are not treated equally there. Corona also didn't play into our cards in such a way that the DFB could now go full throttle. “I don't know exactly what the problem is. We only hear that it works well in other countries because they invest, because they're keen on women's soccer and because they see that it's worthwhile. I don't know why that's still such a problem in Germany. “We players are trying hard, we're always developing, and that's why I don't understand why people aren't completely behind us, why they're not just talking about it.” But this game wasn’t just about problems in Germany. This was also all about Barca, once again. This was about a team at the absolute top of their game, so much so that this wasn’t a perfect performance, but still impressed and gave them a resounding win. A NEW WORLD RECORD CROWD OF 91,648 FANS AT CAMP NOU 🤯 pic.twitter.com/WaGe8ZT7Bc It was, again, in an arena fitting, with 91,648 in the Camp Nou stands this time – Barca breaking their own record for an attendance at a women’s game. It’s an audience that the best team in the world deserves. It was also a warning shot fired to not only Lyon and PSG in the other semi-final of the UWCL, but the whole of Europe. If anyone thought the sensational season last term was a one-off, if they thought opponents would figure out how to stop Barca, they were wrong. With 39 games played in all competitions, Barca have 39 wins. They are eight games away from another treble. They are eight wins away from the most perfect season possible. Can they do it? A few teams have shown it is possible to trouble them, albeit in glimpses. Unbeaten they remain – and unstoppable they look.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barca-uwcl-rout-wolfsburg-perfect-invincible-season/blt10858db71a525abe,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4780,Arsenal's Miedema linked with PSG & Barcelona transfer talks as striker targets Champions League title,"Arsenal striker Vivianne Miedema is keeping her options open as she targets the “next step” in her career amid links to Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain. Miedema, widely regarded as one of the best players of her generation, will see her current contract with the Gunners run out at the end of the 2021-22 season. And while she is enjoying life in London and has been offered a new deal with Arsenal, the Netherlands international is mulling over where she would be best placed to win the Champions League. “In the coming weeks I have to get a certain feeling for the right club,” Miedema told AD. “[But] the door to Arsenal is definitely not closed yet. “Life is good here. And I know myself: I have to be happy off the pitch to perform on the pitch.” On her ambitions, she added: “I want to win the Champions League. I want to get the most out of [my career]. That means I may have to take the next step. I’m 25 and that’s still quite young, but I’ve been around for a while. “The years to come should officially be my peak years, I have to spend it somewhere at a club that best suits my ambitions.” The most recent reports claim that Miedema has held talks with several clubs, including Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona. However, she has stated in the past that the Women's Super League – which Arsenal currently sit atop – is the “strongest in the world”. What remains to be seen is whether the Gunners' vision matches her own, with the player having said over a year ago: “Hopefully Arsenal will keep on developing as well, then I won’t see myself leaving so soon.” Miedema's goalscoring record over the years is exemplary, having bagged 83 in 74 league appearances for Heerenveen, 52 in 78 for Bayern Munich and 66 in 75 for Arsenal. In the 2021-22 season alone, she has racked up seven goals and three assists in 11 WSL games, with only Chelsea's Sam Kerr boasting a better return.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-miedema-psg-barcelona-transfer-talks-target/bltd67d2fa5edeeea72,Stephen Crawford,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4831,"Gunnarsdottir furious that Iceland women have to play Euro 2022 matches at Man City's academy stadium that holds just 7,000 fans","Sara Gunnarsdottir has expressed her fury over the fact that Iceland women will have to play Euro 2022 matches at Manchester City's academy stadium - which holds just 7,000 fans. The women's European Championship is now just a few months away from kicking off, with England set to stage the tournament for only the second time in their history. UEFA has confirmed that matches will take place in 10 different stadiums across nine cities, the smallest of which will be the Etihad Academy Stadium, where two of Iceland's group stage fixtures have already sold out. Gunnarsdottir, who plays her club football with Lyon, believes the inclusion of such a small venue is ""disrespectful"" towards the women's game. ""I am disappointed with the arenas we have been given. It's shocking - we play a tournament in England with several large arenas, and we get to play at a training facility that takes around 5,000 spectators,"" the midfielder said on Fotbollskanalen's Their Pitch podcast. ""It's just embarrassing and it's not the respect we deserve. They haven’t prepared for the fact that we can sell more than 4000, it is disrespectful to women's football. ""Women's football takes two steps in the right direction, but then things like this happen and then you take a step back. But matches will be played in larger arenas that I'm sure will sell out.  ""Women's football explodes and you start to get the respect you deserve. It's getting better - more money is being pumped in now and it's going in the right direction. But there are still things that need to improve."" Iceland have been drawn in Group D at Euro 2022, and will be outsiders to reach the knockout stages as they compete alongside France, Italy and Belgium. The Etihad Academy Stadium will stage Iceland's opening game against Belgium on July 10 and their second group stage clash with Italy four days later, and Gunnarsdottir is frustrated that so many supporters will miss out on seeing the country make their fourth appearance at the tournament. Asked why women are still asked to play at training grounds at major tournaments but not men, the Iceland star replied: ""I would love to know the answer. You wonder if they even follow women's football because it's common sense. It's just stupid to talk about because it's unreasonable and frustrating.  ""Tickets for the matches have sold out so fast that family members have had a hard time getting tickets to the championship.  ""Twenty thousand would probably have come over from Iceland to watch the matches. But family members are struggling to get tickets because they sold out as soon as they dropped.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/gunnarsdottir-furious-iceland-women-euro-2022-man-city/blt73a02f86944b5e7b,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4924,'The referees were not at their best' - Germany coach Voss-Tecklenburg bemoans officiating in Arnold Clark Cup defeat to Canada,"Germany head coach Martin Voss-Tecklenburg wasn't impressed with the officiating in her side's 1-0 defeat to Canada on Sunday, with two penalty shouts for the eight-time European champions waved away in their second game of the Arnold Clark Cup. Canada, Olympic gold medallists last summer, took the lead early on through Vanessa Gilles but the defender - named Player of the Match - was also at the centre of controversy in two possible penalty incidents. The victors also had reason to feel aggrieved, with a potential red card incident involving Germany goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger. Speaking after the game, Voss-Tecklenburg said: ""We wanted to be more aggressive. Obviously, we still have a few things to learn there and things don't come automatically. ""Earlier today, I had a conversation with [captain] Sara Daebritz, where I asked her where we should have the priorities now. We agreed that it was exactly that, we want to be more dominant. We have to work more on the tactics. ""But the thing was that we did allow mistakes tonight. However, on both sides, the referees did not show their best tonight."" After giving Canada the lead, Germany players were shouting for a penalty at Gilles' expense midway through the first half. Winger Jule Brand cut the ball back to Lina Magull, who struck it goalwards first time, with it appearing to strike the hand of the Canada defender when she blocked it. The referee, however, did not point to the spot. Should this have been a penalty?Watch the #ArnoldClarkCup live 👇📺 @ITV4📱 https://t.co/VhvSJqdCYL pic.twitter.com/S8GbO5Lwx4 Canada were calling for intervention from the officials shortly after half time too, with Quinn playing a superb through ball for Nichelle Prince to run onto, only for goalkeeper Berger to bring her down outside the box as she bared down on goal. Again, the referee did not blow her whistle. The final moment of controversy on the night came at the other end. With Germany pushing for an equaliser, Berger sent a long ball forward which Gilles got her head to. However, having not made the contact she wanted, Giulia Gwinn was in a position to burst into the box with the ball - until she went down under a challenge from the defender. Germany's appeals were once again waved away. Canada's win on Sunday night was the first for any side in the Arnold Clark Cup so far, after four games. After drawing with England in their opener, it means that the Olympic champions are top of the group going into the final matchday. They will face Spain on Wednesday, knowing a draw would see them win the inaugural edition of the tournament. England will face Germany later that same day, having drawn their second game in a row earlier on Sunday in a 0-0 result against the Spaniards.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/referees-not-best-germany-coach-voss-tecklenburg-bemoans/bltb96f0788a7e424e5,Amee Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4948,'Is football coming home?' Why England's Lionesses can win the UEFA Women's Euros,"'Is football coming home?' That was the question for Beth Mead after the England forward scored twice against the reigning European champions, the Netherlands, in a 5-1 demolition at Elland Road. It was a big statement from the Lionesses going into the Women’s Euros, sandwiched in between a 3-0 win over Belgium and a 4-0 rout of Switzerland in their pre-tournament friendlies. “We hope so,” said Mead, responding to one of the more direct questions an England player has received about this summer’s ambitions. However, she and her team-mates have not shied away from declaring their aim for the home Euros, which is to win it and give the women’s national team its first major honour. Even a final appearance would mean going one better than the last three major tournaments, with semi-final defeats coming at the 2015 World Cup, 2017 Euros and 2019 World Cup – but that would not satisfy these players. To help them realise their goal, the Football Association (FA) brought in a coach who knows exactly what it takes.  Sarina Wiegman led the Netherlands to this title five years ago, and last August she took the England job. Since she came in, the team hasn’t lost, winning 12 out of 14 games, scoring 84 goals and conceding just three.  On top of all that, England won the Arnold Clark Cup in February, seeing off competition from three of the world’s elite – Spain, Germany and Canada. With all of that said, this is by no means a perfect team. There have still been some defensive frailties on show despite Wiegman repairing a lot of those issues.  Concerns also exist about the ruthlessness in the final third, as England have sometimes failed to turn dominance into goals. One other huge unknown factor going into the Euros is how the Lionesses will handle the pressure of not only being hosts, but also ranked among the favourites. In that sense, the impact Wiegman has had on the environment around the team could make a real difference. “We never really feel like we're under pressure a lot of the time,” Alex Greenwood, the England defender, says in a relaxed tone that matches the atmosphere she’s describing. “[Wiegman] takes that away from us. “The biggest thing for me is she just wants you to enjoy playing your football and enjoy the style of play. That's massive in football.  ""It does help you relax and be okay with making mistakes. That's so important because we're all going to make them. ""We're relaxed in the sense of pressure, but the intensity on the training pitch speaks for itself. That's when we come alive.”  That so many of these players are used to high pressure and high demands at club level helps too, but the Euros will be unlike anything they’ve ever experienced. For that, the FA has been able to tap into the experiences of the men’s team.  Players from Gareth Southgate’s side and Wiegman’s have crossed paths aplenty at St George’s Park, the home of England’s national teams. With games of cards often on the agenda too, the topic of the men’s team’s journey to the Euros final has been a talking point – one which, while not strictly coming in a home tournament, saw them play six of their seven games at Wembley.  Many Lionesses have admitted that picking the brains of people who understand what they are going into has been hugely helpful. Aside from all the off-the-field factors, though, the main reason why England can succeed this summer is the sheer talent throughout the squad. Wiegman’s 23-player roster is packed with ability, variety and experience at the highest level – 20 of these players have lifted multiple major trophies with their clubs, with three of those winning the Champions League. “I think we look at each other and we go, 'I'd have everyone in this team over anyone out of any other team,'” Georgia Stanway, who just signed for Bayern Munich, says. “The competition that we create in training... Whoever's on the bench is constantly pushing the person that is starting. [As a starter], you've constantly got to be on the top of your game, and you've constantly got somebody chasing you.” This will be the most competitive Euros ever.  Sweden, the Olympic silver medallists, have the most balanced team in this tournament. Germany, the eight-time European champions, are always ruthless. Spain have enjoyed a massive rise. France’s stacked squad is intimidating. The reigning champions, the Netherlands, are led by Vivianne Miedema; the 2017 runners-up, Denmark, by Chelsea’s Pernille Harder. But England are certainly one of the top contenders for this title and arguably have fewer flaws than all of their rivals.. “When you’re abroad, you don’t always see what’s going on back home,” says Jill Scott, who is set to feature in her 10th major tournament for England. “To think that we are here, we are going to get to experience it first-hand and what the fans experience, I think the pressure has changed massively. “I don’t even think we are prepared for what we’re going into, but I hope we make everyone proud of us this summer.” The Lionesses don’t need to bring football ‘home’ to do that – but it is what they’re aiming for. And they've got a real shot at it, too.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/football-coming-home-england-lionesses-win-uefa-women-euros/bltd3d4eaad48e51d71,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4953,"Welcome to Wrexham, Rob and Ryan!","2022 marks the year of the UEFA Women's Euro and the FIFA Men’s World Cup. All this week, VICE and GOAL will be collaborating to publish insightful, interesting stories from the world of football and fan culture, introducing VICE fans to GOAL and GOAL fans to VICE. In north-east Wales, a football team was on the brink of financial ruin. For its community, for Welsh football, and with no exaggeration, for the game of football worldwide, this would have been one of the biggest losses imaginable. Wrexham Association Football Club is a small team with a huge history. It is the third-oldest professional club in the world and the oldest in Wales. Based in a town of 65,000 people, they once knocked Arsenal out of the FA Cup and scored a first-leg victory over then-Portuguese Cup champions Porto in the Cup Winners Cup. At the time, the club was in the equivalent of League Two. And there’s the stadium; The Racecourse and its iconic and imposing floodlights. “The oldest stadium in the world still hosting national football matches,” is announced on the public address system each time it hosts a game. The breaking point had come after two decades of neglect and at the hands of a man most Wrexham fans despise; chairman Alex Hamilton. A property developer by trade, he took over the club in 2004 and attempted to get the club evicted from their stadium in order to develop and sell the land it was built on. That could not happen. Fans rallied together; savings were raided, houses remortgaged and eventually the Wrexham Supporters Trust took control of their club. Wrexham AFC – and The Racecourse – were, by the skin of their teeth, going to avoid being taken all the way to the footballing graveyard. It cost the community a six-figure sum and the struggle was unrelenting. Wrexham were playing against teams that had financial backing beyond piggy banks like Brentford and Peterborough United. This could not last and, in 2007-08, they were relegated from League Two. Exiting the Football League for the first time in 87 years, things remained stagnant from that point onwards. The Dragons were not dead, but they were barely alive and at their lowest low. Then, at the back end of the Covid-19 pandemic, there was light – a takeover worth around £2 million ($2.5m). And then there was the trailer. “Our new show on FX is called Welcome to Wrexham, a docu-series centered in Wrexham. A working-class town in north Wales, in the United Kingdom,"" Rob McElhenney, of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia fame, says. He’s stood next to his co-owner, and an even more famous actor, Ryan Reynlods. There’s big spotlights behind them. To their left is Maxine, a Welsh translator. The announcement reveals there will be two seasons of the documentary, housed on Disney’s FX platform and coming to Disney+ internationally. It’ll be fly-on-the-wall, following the owners from Hollywood to Wales, following the players and staff home and away, and the fans from the pub to the stands. To this point, the new owners (RR McReynolds Company LLC) have been met with the closest thing possible to universal acclaim. Since signing the ownership contracts, which 98.2 percent of the Supporters Trust allowed them to do, a lot has happened. The first women’s team in Wrexham’s history has been founded, along with a Powerchair team. The men’s team has been added back onto the FIFA franchise for the first time since FIFA 07 and a new shirt sponsorship deal with TikTok has been secured. Meanwhile, 19 new players have been signed, many from higher leagues, including record arrival Ollie Palmer from AFC Wimbledon, and the Kop stand is being rebuilt. Perhaps most crucially, the club is in talks to buy the freehold for the Racecourse, ensuring it stays as the football team’s home indefinitely. Fans want to see that dream become a reality. “It’s always in the back of my mind – will this ground become a new supermarket?” asks Phillip Lynch, 66. “Will they move the Racecourse elsewhere? It wouldn’t be the same, this place has history, I want it secured.” Beyond that, he just wants the potential windfall spent ‘wisely’. Although official figures haven’t yet been reported, people in Wrexham seem to have the consensus that the documentary will net the club somewhere around £200,000 ($250,000) per episode. That’s a hell of a lot of money when you consider Palmer came in for £322,000 ($400,000). Naturally, money has been a big talking point since the takeover. A cash injection was needed, and it’s been received gladly. This documentary, however, is going beyond the business of football. It’s going to be about this ‘working-class town’, as McElhenney says in the trailer, as much as it is about the team. That’s a far more emotional set of circumstances for club owners to get involved with and, for McElhenney, this seems to be exactly the point of the documentary. There’s a direct inspiration in Sunderland ‘Till I Die, which came out in 2018, and followed the Black Cats in the wake of their relegation from the Premier League. “The documentary was technically well done, but it was painful viewing from a fan’s perspective,” says Luke Booth, a Sunderland supporter. “I didn’t enjoy it, except for seeing the community – the taxi driver, the dinner lady...” Whether McElhenney felt the same, we don’t know. But we do know he felt something deep and personal. That documentary was the Philadelphian’s entry into football. He didn’t understand the game until that moment, but he was hooked and wanted a slice of it. Enter Wrexham. “It was a bit strange at first. We had cameras thrust upon us. And we were having mics put up our shirts to record us. We had to have masks on, masks off, to show different points of lockdown,” says Wayne Jones, owner of The Turf – the oldest pub at any sports stadium in the world. It’s where Wrexham AFC was founded back in 1864. You can see Wayne fixing a cocktail next to the It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia cast in a video promoting the docu-series. It’s a place the owners have rightly got behind and which they are looking to feature as a community hub within the documentary. Wayne, a former Supporters Trust member, is all for the cause. “Early on in the filming I had a couple beers with them one on one, and I asked them, ‘Without the media here, why Wrexham?’” he says. “And I'll tell you the God's honest truth… they're very, very genuine people. I text the film crew most days too, and they’re really caring.” Wayne is keen to stress that he puts the football club above all else and is a fan of the takeover for those reasons. But the year since the ‘Hollywood Boys’ took over has also been the pub’s most successful. He’s also noticed a really good mood around the place. “There feels like a chance of getting out of this hellhole of a league,” he says. Rob Clarke, the owner of Mad 4 Movies, is a lifelong Wrexham fan who is so well-known in the community that Ryan and Rob felt obliged to pay him a visit when they were in town. There’s a newspaper clipping on the screen by the counter, recalling Clarke’s brush with Hollywood fame, and a copy of Deadpool neatly on display among the piles of DVDs, video cassettes and books. The day felt like a shift for Paul, a butcher based in the same market. “We were dead that day because the streets were filled waiting for the owners,” he says. “I don’t follow the football that much but it feels like a documentary will be great for the town.” Clarke conveyed a bit of skepticism about the filming initially. “They film so much that really they could make the place look however they wanted,” he says. “We’ve been burned by owners in the past, so there’s always a worry.” Nathan Salt, a journalist and co-host of the RobRyanRed podcast also mentions the worry of “being made to look like a freak show, because we’ve been cursed for decades.” The ‘freak’ element is largely centered around the fact that Wrexham is a Welsh team in the English leagues which has come on hard times economically. “The town’s had years of neglect, unemployment is high, our industries have been taken away from us,” remarks Rob Gilpin, co-owner of BCCM Boarder Collectables. The concerns are valid. “Other clubs fans were openly mocking Sunderland about it,” Booth says that in the aftermath of Sunderland Till I Die. Having such an intimate look inside a club is rare and it will provide ammunition for other teams. However, Nathan, Rob Gilpin and Rob Clarke all say that despite these worries, they are very trusting of the takeover and the intentions of the new owners with the documentary. “They both have such good reputations, they can only soil themselves if they do this poorly,” says Rich Fay, also a journalist and host of the RobRyanRed podcast. Booth later mentions that, “While my team were mocked, with Wrexham, the only thing rival fans are feeling right now is envy.” Jordan Griffiths, a 29-year-old Wrexham season-ticket holder is excited too. “I have no reservations about the show,” he says. “That might be naive but I think it’ll be positive. I wouldn’t mind if the documentary were to highlight some socio-economic issues around the area, if that brings attention to the issues and helps to start conversations about bettering things. That’ll be a good thing as well. What town doesn’t have its warts, you know?” Today, the town is the same as it's ever been; Paul the butcher, Rob’s DVDs, old empty arcades, a heaving Wetherspoons and the same slowly-decaying high street as almost every other town. But there is something happening in Wrexham – a humming, a rumble of a train just out of sight, “Wrecsam” being whispered in the wind. Thanks to the new owners, you could call it optimism.

4966,"Jorja Fox: Chelsea's teenage defender being nurtured by Kerr, Harder and Eriksson","As Paula Fox, mother of Jorja, the Chelsea defender who signed her first professional contract last summer, recalls her daughter’s first trial with the Blues, she says: “I can remember it, because we felt we'd been bad parents.” It was the summer of 2012, Jorja was eight years old and it was her father, Dave, who took her along. “They went the first day, came back and he was like, 'Oh my gosh, what did I just do to her? Everyone was really good',"" Paula tells GOAL. “He felt like she was just a rabbit in headlights, and I remember taking her to the shops and buying her a treat because I felt so bad that we'd put her through it."" As it transpired, things had gone better than her parents thought. Chelsea liked what they saw and recalled Fox for another trial. She has not looked back since. Working her way through the youth ranks, the defender made her senior debut in the Women's Super League in January 2021, and was part of the squad that won the treble that season, while also reaching the Women's Champions League final. “Dave knows about football and he always did say she was always technically so good, she just wasn't particularly confident. [Chelsea] obviously saw that,” Paula adds. It might seem like a relatively straight-forward rise for the teenager, a childhood Tottenham fan who idolised Gareth Bale as well as Hannah Blundell, the former Chelsea full-back who rose through the Blues’ ranks herself before ending an 11-year spell at the club last summer. But it has been anything but. Fox’s story is one of perseverance and hard work. As with all young footballers, social events had to fall down the pecking order. A huge family holiday sticks out in particular as being ""really hard"" to miss out on. “But there were no second thoughts about it,"" she tells GOAL. ""It was always: 'I'm going to go to the England camp. I can't miss the opportunity'."" Getting into that national team set-up was not easy, either. Naturally a quieter child, ‘showcase’ events, like trials, were not so well-suited to her. She was among the minority in her Chelsea team when players were first selected for regional development camps, overlooked for an opportunity that would then feed into England. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: “That was the first real disappointment,” Paula remembers. “The coaches were talking and it was basically put down to Jorja's personality.” When she did get called up, homesickness was another obstacle that needed to be overcome, and Fox’s mental toughness would benefit massively as she did so. That tough resolve is a common theme. Paula reels off numerous things that Fox has mastered over the years - freestyle tricks in the garden as a kid, juggling and the Rubik’s cube in lockdown - and it is clear that she is someone that does not give up on anything, no matter how big or small. That attitude has helped her break into a star-studded Chelsea squad. An attack-minded full-back with a great work ethic, she is now getting regular first-team experience on loan at Charlton in the Championship, while returning to her parent club once a week, where she is learning from some of the world’s best. ""The best thing about playing against [the Chelsea stars] is you know you can't really get any better than them,"" Fox says. ""You know you're pushing yourself to the limit. ""Sam Kerr was like a mum to me last year, which was really helpful. She's always trying to make jokes. I love that about her. I think it helped me settle a lot into the team last season. “Pernille [Harder] and especially Magda [Eriksson], as well. I felt like they were always making sure I'm okay, always asking how I am and stuff like that. It was a nice balance.” “She really, really looks up to Magda. I think she's been a huge influence on her,” Paula adds, believing she has “learned” a lot about being level-headed from the Blues skipper. “She often talks about trying to be a mixture of the players. I think that's hopefully going to really help, because she can see the parts of the players that she feels like she wants to be like. More than just the football, I think there are some amazing women role models there that she now kind of wants to emulate.” A player who already has that calmness and good decision-making about her - in both her play and off the pitch - Fox appears to have the perfect balance right now for her development. The Women's Under-19 European Championship this summer could be another huge experience in her young, but eventful, career to date. “I think for this season, I just want to continue to focus on my personal development in the Championship and get myself to a point next season where I can be in contention at Chelsea for pre-season and get myself at a level where I can compete in the WSL,” she says. “Next year, I'd love to be playing in the WSL, whether that's at Chelsea or on loan at another club. “Long-term, I want to be a Chelsea player and that's all I've ever wanted to be.” For more on the world's best young ballers, follow NXGN on Instagram and TikTok.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/jorja-fox-chelsea-teenage-defender-kerr-harder-eriksson/bltc942cc01d74d5ff7,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5004,Karna Solskjaer departs Man Utd after winning two academy trophies,"Forward Karna Solskjaer, the daughter of former Manchester United player and coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has left the Red Devils for Norwegian third-tier side AaFK Fortuna. The 19-year-old recently won the WSL academy league and cup trophies but had received few first-team opportunities. So, she will head to her home country in search of more playing time to further her development. The attacker notched 15 goals in 21 league apps this year in the WSL academy league. Two weeks ago, she claimed her second trophy of the campaign in the WSL cup. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer watching his daughter Karna Solskjaer celebrate her second trophy with Man United.A proud Dad ❤️ pic.twitter.com/sCniGMIYRS “It was clear to us very early that Karna had a special talent,” John Marius Dybvik, chairman of Solskjaer's former club Clausenengen FK, told GOAL in March. “She was already a notorious goal scorer, which of course her teams benefited from. She has always been very good at dribbling. From early, she could dribble by two or three opponents and score a goal. “Of course, when you have a famous striker as your father, he must have had a lot of impact on her developing and how she developed skills. That's for sure. “She definitely had a striking way to train and develop her technical skills, which were her foremost assets when she was a youngster. “We as a club, we would like to say that we are very proud and happy on behalf of Karna.” Manchester United first-team coach Marc Skinner has also praised Solskjaer, though he said she needed to improve her speed of play and decision-making. “What she does have - and I want to make sure Ole tries to pass these secrets on - is a wonderful finishing ability,” Skinner said earlier this season.

5023,Ruby Mace: England’s Ronaldo-inspired teenager who left Arsenal for Man City,"‘Could we have a ball? My little girl wants to play with it’. It was a question that the manager of a local boys’ team in Essex used to hear every weekend. He probably did not realise, though, that little girl would go on to become one of Arsenal’s most promising academy products, one fans were disappointed to see join rivals Manchester City in the summer of 2021. Ruby Mace featured off the bench a few times for the Gunners' first team before a productive loan spell with fellow Women’s Super League side Birmingham in 2020-21, but, after 11 years at Arsenal, she would sign her first professional contract elsewhere. “When I got the call to say Man City wanted me, it was very hard, but I feel like it wasn't as hard as I thought it was,” Mace, an England youth international, tells GOAL, having had several months to reflect on her decision. “This is a big club and both teams wanted the best for me, but I feel like the plan Man City put out for me was going to benefit me more than what Arsenal put out for me. I feel like an opportunity like this, I couldn't turn it down.” It was on the sidelines as a child, while watching her older brother play, that Mace started to forge the path that led to that first pro deal. She was just four years old when her mother encouraged her to try out for a boys’ team just one pitch over. Mace was successful, and with her new team was scouted by West Ham, where she played for a year. Then, aged six, came the chance to join Arsenal. The impact the Gunners had on her is evident. Her technical ability stands out, particularly her ability to use both feet, something she recalls there being big emphasis on at Arsenal. The tactical focus would come later, helping to develop Mace into not only a talented young player, but a very versatile one. “I used to play right-back when I was five, six [years old],” the now-18-year-old says. “Then when I went to Arsenal, you played everywhere, every position, a different position every game. I was a winger one game, then I was left-back, and then I just grew into playing midfield and centre-back.” It is the latter that has grown to be her favourite. Mace spent the second half of last season playing in midfield for Birmingham, an experience that taught her a lot about herself. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: “I feel like every young player needs to experience that before then deciding what they want to do,” Mace says. “I could have gone to Birmingham and I might not have been at the level to then move to Man City. I might have had to go to the Championship. I feel like once I did that, I thought to myself: 'If I keep working hard, then I can be capable of this big move'. I feel like that really like determined my next move.” That transfer was never going to be easy for a 17-year-old very close to her family, but Mace has always known it is not easy to reach the top. “When I was younger, I used to have this one-to-one coach. He always used to talk to me about [Cristiano] Ronaldo, because Ronaldo had a hard childhood, with his family and stuff, and he had to work for what he had,” she remembers. “When I was younger, I used to idolise him because - I feel - he's had a much harder journey than me, but mine has still been hard with family and stuff.” While adjusting to the move to Manchester – the “hardest” thing in Mace's career so far – her first summer with City was a strange one. Only a handful of players were in training and no pre-season fixtures were scheduled, due to the number of players involved in the Olympic Games and some injuries. But it gave Mace opportunity to spend every day with England international Alex Greenwood, which both she and head coach Gareth Taylor have highlighted as being very valuable. “I quite idolise Alex,” Mace says. “I feel like she's a very good role model to me and she's always helped me. She's always guided me through training, even if at times I'm not doing what I need to be doing. She'll come and make sure I'm alright. I feel like being around her brings out my game in a better way, which is really good. “For me, I had six months to prove that I don't need to go out on loan. I've spoken to Gareth about that, how that's my main target for the season, to prove to him that I am good enough, to work hard in training and show that I don't need to be a loan player.” She has made great strides doing that over the last couple of months. In November, she made her WSL debut for City, and has completed 90 minutes on four occasions since across the league and Continental Cup. Mace has shown that she is ready to perform for Taylor's side both this season and in the long-term, and City believe that they have brought in a player with a truly bright future.

5042,Why are future USWNT stars turning their backs on college soccer?,"Five years ago, Mallory Pugh made American soccer history. Pugh, then 19, opted to leave UCLA after playing just three games to become a professional. The highly-touted teenager, who had already played for the United States national team in the 2016 Olympics, became the first player to bypass college to sign in the NWSL. At the time, Pugh was a rarity. Now, she has become a model for a subsequent generation of women’s players who have opted to forgo some, or all, of their collegiate career to pursue professional opportunities. But even though the number of women’s players going pro early is increasing, that path is still only open to a tiny fraction. For most of the history of women’s pro soccer in the U.S., players spending four years in college was the norm. With pay low and athletic careers finite, it only made sense to take advantage of a free education to secure a four-year degree and the future earning opportunities that came with it. Though that is still the path most travel in the women’s game, there are signs that, as in the men’s game, college is becoming less attractive for top-tier prospects. When the San Diego Wave selected Naomi Girma first overall in the 2022 NWSL Draft, it marked the fourth consecutive draft in which the top overall pick had opted to leave college early. “I think ultimately I just wanted to take the next step and start my professional career,” Girma told GOAL on All of US: The U.S. Women’s Soccer Show. “I knew there were such great opportunities in the NWSL and had seen a lot of change starting to happen… It just felt like the right time for me to go and challenge myself and take it to the next level.” The benefits of going pro early have become more and more visible of late. In 2019, Tierna Davidson left Stanford early and used that head start to launch herself into a spot on the 2019 World Cup team. At age 20, Davidson was the youngest player on the tournament-winning roster. Two years later, Catarina Macario announced she would also be leaving Stanford early, so as to sign for seven-time European champions Lyon. Within 10 days, she had made her USWNT debut. The top two picks in the 2021 NWSL Draft, early entrants Emily Fox and Trinity Rodman, have also both reached the U.S. women’s national team already. Rodman, one of if not the biggest rising star in the U.S., skipped college entirely. This year, three of the top six picks – Girma, Mia Fishel and Diana Ordonez – were early entrants. Fishel, who was selected by the Orlando Pride before opting to sign with Mexican side Tigres, made no secret of the fact that she felt playing collegiately was holding her back. “I thought my development was hitting a wall,” Fishel told GOAL on All of US: The U.S. Women’s Soccer Show. “I knew what the college system was like. I was very comfortable with the training at UCLA. “I just felt like I want to be the best player in the world, and another year here [wasn’t] going to help me as a soccer player. And so I decided, after talking to my coaches and my family, that if I want to be the best soccer player in the world, I have to go professional.” The trend of players leaving school early is likely to continue, as opportunities abroad increase while compensation in the NWSL takes a jump forward under the league’s new collective bargaining agreement. The NWSL minimum salary will increase from $22,000 (£16,000) last season to $35,000 (£26,000) this year. On the other end of the spectrum, Rodman recently became the first million-dollar NWSL player when she inked a contract extension with the Washington Spirit worth a reported $1.1 million over four seasons. But the increase in players forgoing some or all of college will, for now, be limited. The NWSL still lacks a homegrown player mechanism by which clubs can sign their most promising academy products. And despite salary gains, many college players would still earn more by graduating and finding a job outside of sports. While the Fishels, Davidsons and Girmas of the world will continue to follow the trail originally blazed by Pugh, for countless others, the pull of staying in school all four years will be too strong to resist.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-future-uswnt-stars-turning-backs-college-soccer/bltd8a97f888abd48ad,Seth Vertelney,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5119,"Macario, Pugh and the USWNT winners and losers of the SheBelieves Cup","After the U.S. women’s national team defeated Iceland 5-0 on Wednesday night, clinching the SheBelieves Cup, head coach Vlatko Andonovski was asked if he got what he wanted from the tournament. Andonovski was guarded, but offered praise after his youthful roster improved with each of the tournament’s three games. “I feel comfortable saying that we made strides,” he said. “There's always going to be room for improvement especially with a young group of players like this one. ""But with what we had lined up, I feel very comfortable saying that we did a pretty good job."" The USWNT opened the tournament with a frustrating 0-0 draw with the Czech Republic and then defeated New Zealand 5-0 thanks in part to an extraordinary own-goal hat-trick. The 5-0 win over Iceland, by comparison, was much more convincing and easily the team’s best performance of the tournament. With Andonovski omitting several of his veteran mainstays, a host of young players had the chance to shine at the SheBelieves Cup – and a few of them grabbed that chance. Let’s take a look at the USWNT’s winners and losers from the SheBelieves Cup... The 22-year-old showed flashes in the first two games but put it all together against Iceland, scoring a pair of wonder goals in the first half of a star-making turn. Macario has played all over the field for the USWNT since her debut in January 2021, but the SheBelieves Cup offered her first chance to get an extended look at the No.9 position. if you need an extra chip with your guac, @catarinamacario’s got you 🥑 pic.twitter.com/sXOwwBXtir Andonovski said that Macario needed time to become comfortable with playing as a striker for the national team but that, more importantly, her teammates needed to adjust to her tendencies. “We saw in the three games, from game one to game three, how Cat grew, but mostly we saw how the team grew around Cat,” he said.  “Understanding her movements, understanding her positioning, the angles, the balls that she is playing – that’s where we grew the most. “It wasn't necessarily that Cat grew in the position as much as the team grew with Cat in that position.” Andonovski clearly wanted a long look at how Davidson and Cook would operate together as his center-back partnership and the youthful duo hardly put a foot wrong throughout the tournament. “I want to give lots of credit to our back line and goalkeepers,” Andonovski said. “I thought they did an incredible job throughout the tournament.  ""With our two center backs who [got] the great majority of the minutes, Alana and Tierna, I thought they were pretty much spot on.” The pair weren’t called upon much defensively but did their job when asked, and also helped spearhead the team’s attack with their distribution. Davidson’s cross-field passes, in particular, can pull opposing defenses apart. Becky Sauerbrunn is clearly still a major part of the team but the USWNT captain is 36, which leaves Davidson, 23, and Cook, 24, well positioned to be the team’s center-back pairing of the future if they continue to grow together. After an absence from the USWNT picture due to injury and indifferent form, it’s clear that Pugh is squarely back in the mix. Pugh followed a standout 2021 campaign with the Chicago Red Stars by leading the USWNT in goals at the SheBelieves Cup with three, scoring for the first time with the national team since October 2019. The 𝙣𝙚𝙬 kids are alright. pic.twitter.com/RAeGBaYI4e Still only 23, Pugh is positioning herself to be a major piece of the USWNT’s front line moving forward, regardless of if or when Andonovski reintroduces the likes of Megan Rapinoe, Tobin Heath and Christen Press into the mix. Dahlkemper was forced to pull out of the roster before the tournament started due to a back injury, and then watched the aforementioned duo of Cook and Davidson star in her absence. It wasn’t long ago that Dahlkemper and Sauerbrunn were the team’s unquestioned starters at center back, but Dahlkemper’s difficult Olympics opened the door for Davidson to assume a starting role and Cook has subsequently shown her quality as well. At 28, Dahlkemper is right in her prime and still has plenty left to give the USWNT, but she needs a bounce-back 2022 campaign with new club San Diego Wave in order to regain her footing. This is admittedly slightly harsh on Williams, who didn’t have a bad tournament, but the forward did find herself overshadowed by the likes of Sophia Smith, Midge Purce, Pugh, Macario and others. Williams had a breakthrough Olympics and, at 28, she appeared well positioned to play an even more prominent role when some of the USWNT’s older attacking stars rode off into the sunset. But now Williams will be looking over her shoulder at a younger crop of forwards and wonder where Andonovski sees her fitting in. At the SheBelieves Cup, Williams came off the bench in two matches and didn’t play the other.  Perhaps Andonovski simply sees Williams as a known quantity and wanted a longer look at other players. Or it could be a sign of things to come.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/macario-pugh-uswnt-winners-losers-shebelieves-cup/blt9c686e248a4aad3a,By Seth Vertelney,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5131,Popp sets Women's Euro goal record with semi-final double to send Germany past France,"Alexandra Popp set a Women's Euro record on Wednesday as she fired Germany into the 2022 tournament final, bagging both goals in the 2-1 semi-final victory over France at Milton Keynes. Popp volleyed Germany ahead in the 41st minute, showing great instinct to meet cross from the right and lash in from six yards - only for an unfortunate own goal by goalkeeper Merle Frohms to level the score before half time. Germany's captain would not be denied her shot at history however, rising to head home 14 minutes from time to set up a blockbuster final against hosts England on Sunday at Wembley. Those strikes take Popp to six goals for the tournament, level with England's Beth Mead in the golden boot race - a fascinating side-show for Sunday's final. Popp has already made history however, having scored in all five Germany matches at this Euros so far. No female player has ever scored in more games at a single European tournament. She overtakes compatriot Heidi Mohr, who scored in four games spread across three tournaments (1989, 1991 and 1993). Unsurprisingly Popp was named player of the match for her performance, in what is the 29-year-old's first ever Euros. Terrible luck with injuries have prevented her playing in the competition until this one. By far and away the most successful nation in the tournament's history, this will be Germany's ninth Euros final out of 11 tournament appearances. Only in 1993 and 2017 have they failed to reach the last game in Euros where they have featured - and they have won every final in which they have played.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/popp-euros-goal-record-send-germany-final-france/bltec900750ae296e84,Emma Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5134,"Havertz, Tuchel and Chelsea's stars giving staff and fans hope in uncertain times","Thomas Tuchel screamed in joy and pumped his fist after Chelsea stole all three points late on against Newcastle on Sunday. The difference between one point and three would not have been huge at this stage of the season, given that a Premier League title charge is highly unlikely, while the chances of a slip out of the top four would be similar odds. But Kai Havertz's stunning first touch and shot in the 89th minute gave the Blues something positive to hold onto after what has been a distressing week. The football operation within the club is showing its ability to block out the negativity, with owner Roman Abramovich having been sanctioned by the UK Government and stripped of his directorship of the club by the Premier League. ""There are a lot of people that I see daily who are worried and who work for decades,"" Tuchel said when asked by GOAL. ""They are not so famous, but they are worried for a pretty close future, wonder if things will be alright.  “So for them, it's important to have the attitude right and also to focus on that and see the responsibility and what this means to these people. ""Even if it's just for 90 minutes. When we played football during the coronavirus, we knew we couldn't cure the virus. But we tried to give some hope so people could feel joy, excitement, maybe even anger and entertainment. ""This is what we try to do now. The matter is very serious. The Kai Havertz goal was exceptional. We were, of course, a bit lucky today. ""We maybe had a hard time on the pitch because Newcastle were physical, and gave us difficulty to create chances and accelerate the game in the last 30 metres. ""But it was so important not to concede. To have the quality with one chance, one quality pass and one quality finish to win it. Thank goodness we did it."" Matchwinner Havertz echoed his manager's words in his post-match interview with Sky Sports. ""It is hard for everyone, not only us, and we feel sorry for everyone. The fans, the workers, the academy - for everyone it's a tough time. ""We try to give everything for them in the moment. If we can give them moments like this, it's nice because it's tough times. We try to do that, and it's a good feeling."" The Blues have been given a special licence to continue playing with Abramovich’s assets frozen. They have an allowance of £900,000 per home game, while they have been given just £20,000 to spend on travel expenses to their away games. The banks have frozen the club's credit cards and sponsors Three and Hyundai have suspended their agreements with the club. Chelsea have been asked to remove those logos from their kit, but lack the cash flow to resolve the issue. There are rumours that they will have to take commercial budget flights to matches instead of private jets. Meanwhile, there has also been speculation that their team bus has already run out of petrol. Those reports have been denied to GOAL this week, and the Blues have yet to feel the full scale of the sanctions, having paid for a lot of services before March 10, when Abramovich was sanctioned. ""My last information is we are getting a plane [to Lille in the Champions League]. So we can go by plane and come back by plane,"" Tuchel told reporters. ""If not, we'll go by train. If not, we'll go by bus. If not, I'll drive a seven-seater! Honestly, I will do it. You can mark my words, I will do it to arrive there."" The away game against Middlesbrough on Saturday in the FA Cup will be the first time Chelsea cannot sell tickets to their fans, while the club shop remains closed and matchday programmes could not be purchased ahead of kick-off against Newcastle. With negotiations ongoing with both buyers and the UK Government, who are now involved in the sale of the club, people in west London are fearing for their jobs. The unease has also been felt by the supporters, with several arrests ahead of the game as Newcastle supporters baited the Blues about their problems. The men's team, women's team and academy teams have all been able to carry on and have impressively shut out the noise. While the men's team were winning at Stamford Bridge, for example, Emma Hayes' women's side laboured to a 1-0 win over Aston Villa to keep afloat in their own Women's Super League title battle. Just like Havertz did for the men, Sam Kerr netted a last-minute winner at Kingsmeadow. Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck has sent around an all-staff email to urge the club to pull together and not to leak any internal information, but did not assure anyone of their jobs. The department heads, like academy director Neil Bath, have urged a 'business-as-usual approach', even though they are facing challenges running the club as before. Technical and performance advisor Petr Cech's tone certainly was not reassuring as he spoke ahead of kick-off on Sunday. ""We hope so [that people keep getting paid],"" Cech told Sky Sports. ""That the people working at the club will be able to get their salaries and have that for the place to work. ""This is a difficult question for me to answer as I don't have the answer."" Indeed, there was only so much he could say, with board members not fronting up to supporters or to the media about the scale of the club's problems. All we have seen from the likes of Buck and director Marina Granovskaia is their images on the matchday broadcast, their faces both carrying a stoic look, with their associate Abramovich now unable to operate in the western world. Those images are far from reassuring, and neither are the conversations around Chelsea. Yet, the fact remains that one of the world's best managers is still leading one of the world's best football teams. They are the European and world champions and are motivated by their unique ability to entertain during uncertain times. ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/havertz-tuchel-chelsea-staff-fans-hope-uncertain-times/blt811dd2d0386601da,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5181,USWNT to face Colombia in friendlies ahead of Concacaf Championship,"The USWNT will play Colombia in two friendlies in June as they finalize their plans for the Concacaf Championship. The matches will take place on June 25 at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colorado and on June 28 at Rio Tinto Stadium in Sandy, Utah. The Concacaf W Championship, which takes place in Mexico in July, will also act as qualification for 2023 Women’s World Cup and 2024 Olympics. Speaking about the Colombia doubleheader, U.S. head coach Vlatko Andonovski said: “Colombia has a good chance to make it to the World Cup and both teams will be in our final preparations for our qualifying tournaments, so I expect some highly competitive matches between players who are competing to represent their countries in some really important games. “When we get to Colorado, we’ll be coming off a stretch of more than two months that the players have been with their clubs and away from the national team environment, so we’ll be looking to get maximum value out of our last days and games together before we go to Mexico for qualifying.” After the two friendlies Andonovski’s side will then take on Haiti, Jamaica and Mexico in Group A at the Concacaf W Championship. The top two teams from each group automatically qualify for the 2023 Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, while the tournament winner automatically qualifies for the 2024 Paris Olympics. For Colombia, the matches will serve as preparation for the 2022 Copa America Femenina, which it will host in July. Three teams from that tournament will qualify directly for the 2023 Women’s World Cup, with two more joining the 10-team intercontinental playoff tournament.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uswnt-to-face-colombia-in-friendlies-ahead-of-concacaf/blt7e28d5d2f866e194,Tom Mallows,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5182,Saudi consortium enter race to buy £3bn-valued Chelsea from Roman Abramovich,"A  Saudi private consortium led by Saudi Media registered their interest yesterday to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich through Raine Group, a New York merchant bank that has been hired to find a buyer.  Sources with knowledge of the situation described at least 10 serious buyers, with many others holding an interest.  The sheer number of interested parties, which includes Todd Boehly and Hansjorg Wyss's US-Swiss consortium and Turkish businessman Muhsin Bayrak, gives Abramovich some hope in claiming his highly ambitious £3 billion ($4bn) valuation.  Although it is not known who the individual backers are at this stage, Saudi Media are a fund that is heavily involved in funding media, advertising and sports brands across the world.  However, their main content offering is for the pan-Arab broadcasting market. The company has offices in both Dubai, UAE and Saudi Arabia itself.  One barrier to their success in claiming Chelsea might be the caution around accepting any bids from a 'politically sensitive' party.   The aim is for the Russian oligarch to accept a bid by 15 March but the billionaire is open to extending it, should he decide it will help the process.   The proceeds of the sale, we are told, will go to the 'victims of the ongoing war in Ukraine'. That careful wording in Abramovich's statement on Wednesday last week leaves open the concerns that funds could go to both sides of the war which was sparked by Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.   Also within that statement, it was revealed that Abramovich would write off the £1.5bn ($2bn) that he is owed by Chelsea in the form of a loan through his holding company Fordstam Ltd.   That means that the £1.5bn won't be banked by Abramovich after he completes a sale.  The Blues' travelling support was criticised by their own manager Thomas Tuchel for chanting Abramovich's name during the Premier League-organised tribute for Ukraine ahead of their weekend win over Burnley. Those misguided actions go to show the pain among the hardcore support of losing an owner who has funded 21 trophies in 19 years of his ownership.   Any new owner is highly unlikely to offer the same level of investment in the Blues, which will likely be on a more stable footing.   However, it is also an opportunity to start a new more transparent era at the club and the Chelsea Supporters Trust (CST), the most influential supporters group, has issued a list of requests to any new owners.   They want the outstanding balance of the Chelsea Pitch Owners' (CPO) loan to be repaid, which stands at around £8m, to be waived.   Alongside that, they are asking for more fan involvement in the club, support for the Chelsea Women's team and the following of the recommendations from Tracey Crouch's government report on football governance. Although not stated in their manifesto for a new owner, the need to rebuild Stamford Bridge is a major additional issue.  Although the club has many attractive aspects, including their TV deals and the quality of the playing squad, the need to redevelop Stamford Bridge could cost more than £2bn after buying the west Londoners.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/saudi-consortium-enter-race-to-buy-gbp3bn-valued-chelsea/blt514be0357c6769eb,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5184,Liverpool win Championship to book return to Women's Super League,"Liverpool Women have won the Women's Championship after beating Bristol City 4-2 on Sunday. The Reds have secured promotion to the FA Women's Super League two years after they were last relegated from the top-flight. Liverpool needed to avoid defeat in the away clash in order to secure the title but managed to take the three points. Niamh Fahey opened the scoring for the visitors when a long throw-in disrupted the Bristol defence, allowing the 34-year-old to knock it in from close range. After Bristol levelled the score, the away team's lead was restored thanks to a goal from Jasmine Matthews. 2021-22 #FAWC CHAMPIONS 🏆Huge congratulations, @LiverpoolFCW! 👏 pic.twitter.com/JaoveXdFgs Katie Stengel then made it three for Liverpool who finished from close range after the ball was headed on to her.

The Reds confirmed their place as league champions in front of a crowd of 5.752 - a record attendance in the Championship. The win against second-placed Bristol puts Liverpool 14 points clear at the top of the table after 20 matches. The Reds have lost just one match so far this season, winning 15 and drawing four. Liverpool return to the English top-flight after a two-year absence from the division.

5189,England national anthem: God Save the King lyrics in full & meaning explained,"The playing of national anthems before international football matches is a long-standing tradition of the game. Players line up on the sideline for what is effectively one final rousing gesture before battle commences on the pitch. For some - players included - the national anthem stirs up emotions and singing it is an essential component of international football. Others respectfully observe the moment in silence, while the odd few may even dislike it. Here, GOAL takes a look at the England national anthem, lyrics and meaning of the song. 'God Save the King' (previously 'God save the Queen') is the anthem used by the England national team as its sporting anthem for international matches. Officially God Save the King is the national anthem of the United Kingdom, but it has been synonymous with England since it first appeared in 1745.  Generally speaking, only the first verse of God Save the King is used in sport, which means that it falls within FIFA's regulations regarding national anthems, which dictate that each team's anthem should not exceed 90 seconds in length. The song tends to be used when the nation is represented in sporting endeavours but there are some exceptions. The England cricket team, for example, uses 'Jerusalem' as its anthem. It is not known for sure who wrote the anthem, but attributions have been made to English composer John Bull. God Save the King (or God Save the Queen) was adopted as the British national anthem in 1745 and it has remained so to this day. The song is an ode to the sitting monarch and calls for the divine preservation of his or her reign as well as the demise of their foes. The original lyrics referred specifically to the then British monarch King George II and a number of versions, including some of a more militaristic hue, have appeared through the years. However, the song has since been standardised and you can see that version in full below. God save our gracious King!Long live our noble King!God save the King!Send him victorious,Happy and glorious,Long to reign over us:God save the King!O Lord our God arise,Scatter his enemies,And make them fall:Confound their politics,Frustrate their knavish tricks,On Thee our hopes we fix:God save us all.  Thy choicest gifts in store,On him be pleased to pour;Long may he reign:May he defend our laws,And ever give us cause,To sing with heart and voice,God save the King! In football the United Kingdom is represented by four national teams: England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. However, only the England and Northern Ireland teams use the British national anthem before games, while the Scotland and Wales teams have their own unique national anthems - 'Flower of Scotland' and 'Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau' ('Old Land of My Fathers'). With Scotland and Wales both adopting separate, distinct anthems for sport, England's use of the British national anthem - which officially encompasses the entire UK - has been an occasional talking point among politicians, supporters and athletes alike. The question has been raised on a number of occasions and in 2016 a motion put forward by Labour MP Toby Perkins, calling for a uniquely English national anthem to be adopted, was debated in the British parliament. Perkins observed that God Save the Queen before England games ""reflects a sense that we see Britain and England as synonymous."" The British National Anthem is sung by the congregation in the presence of The Queen. #CommonwealthDay pic.twitter.com/qc2cf3osF8 A 2007 poll conducted by the campaign group 'Anthem4England' saw 'Jerusalem' - the song used by the England cricket team - come out on top as the preferred alternative ahead of suggestions such as 'Land of Hope and Glory' and 'Rule Britannia'. Others, including Perkins, have suggested that a new song could be specifically penned. Interestingly, God Save the Queen has sometimes been met with negative response from opposition fans. In 2005, for example, the anthem was booed by Welsh fans in Cardiff ahead of a World Cup qualification game between Wales and England. At the time, then England captain David Beckham remarked: ""The players were hyped up for the game anyway but when they heard that, it definitely motivated us."" In 2017, the Scottish Football Association (SFA) was fined £4,000 by FIFA after fans booed God Save the Queen ahead of a World Cup qualification match between Scotland and England in Glasgow. Fans of Premier League club Liverpool are also known to boo the anthem, in keeping with the spirit of 'Scouse not English'. As mentioned, the Northern Ireland team also uses God Save the King as an anthem before international games, but not without controversy. The anthem is particularly divisive in Northern Ireland because it is not felt to be representative of those individuals from the region who consider themselves Irish and not British. Former president of the Irish Football Association (IFA) Jim Shaw acknowledged the difficulty of the anthem in a 2016 interview with the Belfast Telegraph .  ""If we keep it, we annoy people and we know if it goes, there will be plenty of angry supporters,"" Shaw said. ""But it’s not for the Irish FA to decide what the national athem of Northern Ireland is. That is for the devolved government at Stormont."" Being the anthem of the UK, God Save the Queen (as it was) was also used by the Team GB football team during the 2012 Olympics. However, some players on both the men's and women's teams - specifically those from Wales and Scotland - faced criticism from some quarters for not singing. Elsewhere, while it doesn't use God Save the King, Liechtenstein's national anthem 'Oben am jungen Rhein' ('High on the Young Rhine') uses the exact same melody, which has been a source of minor confusion at games against Northern Ireland and England. Interestingly, Commonwealth nations such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada use God Save the King as an official royal anthem, but they each have their own anthems too.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/englands-national-anthem-god-save-the-queen-lyrics-in-full/1p8it1rqep40n1ra77zx4lehpl,Ryan Kelly,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5206,What is the 'perfect season' in football & which teams have done it?,"The current Barcelona Femeni side can legitimately claim to be one of the best women's football teams of all time, but one achievement has thus far eluded them: the perfect season. It can still be done in 2021-22, but they will need to keep winning their remaining games in order to grasp it. So what is a perfect season and who has done it? GOAL brings you everything you need to know. When a team is said to have completed a 'perfect season', it means they have gone through an entire league campaign without losing or drawing a single game; they have won every fixture. Generally speaking, in assessing a perfect season, only the primary league competition is considered. A rare achievement, it requires a combination of supreme talent and consistency, as well as a dash of luck on occasion. The concept of a 'perfect season' is not exclusive to football and it is a term which is also applied in other sports, including American football, Australian Rules football and so on. The first leg of the Women's Champions League semi-final between Barcelona and Wolfsburg can be watched exclusively live on DAZN. The number of teams that have achieved a perfect season is relatively low, particularly in the men's game. Among the teams to achieve the feat are Scottish side Rangers (1898-99) and Hungarian outfit Ferencvaros (1931-32). Many more teams have passed through entire campaigns undefeated, including the Arsenal Invincibles in the Premier League (2003-04). Their nickname was inspired by the Preston North End team that went an entire First Division season unbeaten in 1888-89. Antonio Conte steered Juventus through Serie A unbeaten in 2011-12, while Brendan Rodgers masterminded Celtic's unbeaten season across multiple competitions in 2016-17. Steven Gerrard helped Rangers to an unbeaten Scottish Premiership season in 2020-21. Legendary Romanian side Steaua Bucuresti famously went three seasons unbeaten in 1986-87, 1987-88 and 1988-89, while AC Milan achieved it in Serie A in 1991-92 under Fabio Capello. ✅ Wins: 26🤝 Draws: 12❌ Defeats: 0Will any Premier League team ever match the achievements of Arsenal's Invincibles? 😍 pic.twitter.com/9htaMbHDn0 Perfect seasons have been a more common feature of the women's game. Juventus Women completed a perfect season in 2020-21 in a campaign which also saw them win the 2020 Supercoppa Italiana. Barcelona Women went agonisingly close to achieving it the same season, but lost once to Atletico Madrid. Norway's Asker completed a perfect season in 1998, while PAOK managed it in Greece in 2010-11 then later in 2018-19. Lyon achieved a perfect season in 2014-15. NSA Sofia have done it three times (2017-18, 2018-19, 2020-21), while Zytlobud-1 Kharkiv won the Ukrainian league in perfect fashion in 2018-19. Lithuania's Gintra Universitetas pulled off a perfect season in 2020 and Albania's Vllaznia did it in 2021-22.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-perfect-season-football-which-teams-have-done-it/blt62050683823478ca,GOAL,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5213,From shock Champions League exit to winning a major trophy: Manchester City's Conti Cup triumph summed up their season,"If there was a game that could sum up the season that Gareth Taylor’s Manchester City side have had so far, then Saturday evening’s Continental Cup final triumph came close to perfectly doing so. The holders and their opponents in the showpiece event Chelsea might have started on the front foot, often pinning City into their own box early on, but it was the Manchester club that emerged victorious from a goal down, with Caroline Weir scoring twice and Ellen White once in the turnaround. For a side who were knocked out of the Women’s Champions League in the qualifying rounds this season, and were as low as ninth in the Women’s Super League standings at one point, a comeback like this to win the first major trophy on offer this campaign was fitting. “It mirrored that, if I'm honest,” Taylor said. There have been many points throughout this turbulent year that the City coach’s future has been called into question. Ravaged by injuries to key players and going into the season cold after no pre-season, with so many of the squad away at the Olympics until late in the summer, City won just two of their first seven games. Arsenal beat them 5-0 in September. Chelsea beat them 3-0 the following month, and 4-0 a few weeks later. Their challenge for the WSL title evaporated early doors and there have been moments where qualification for next year’s Champions League has looked out of reach, too. After the game on Saturday, Chelsea manager Emma Hayes even described City’s season as “woeful” until now. “Credit to them for the bounce back from a really, really tough start.” Slowly but surely, fortunes have changed. Players have returned to fitness, Taylor has made tactical tweaks in the long-term and also in-game changes that have helped turn things around. That they boasted a bench with more than four names, all genuinely established ones too, on Saturday was a luxury that simply wouldn’t have been imaginable a few months ago. “I came off of all social media at that time,” Taylor said, recalling that period he spent under pressure from the fans. “I literally surrounded myself with the right people. “I’m an ex-player. I’ve had criticism all my career, so I kind of know how to handle it – that doesn’t mean I like it. Manchester City collecting trophies 🏆 #fyp #footballtiktok #soccer #football #mancity “I just tried to cut out the noise. I knew that I was working as hard as I was previously. I felt that it was a little bit unjustified, if I’m honest, with the amount of injuries that we had. “What were they expecting in that situation when we were only able to field two or three outfield substitutes in a game and playing players in unfamiliar positions? “I’ve been in this game for a long time, it is what it is, it’s part and parcel. It’s easy these days to point a finger and say, ‘Is this person up to it or not?’ “But I think you have to have belief in what you do. I have real faith in how I work and how I try to get the best out of players. The players are the most important thing though, the most important marker is that they’re moving in the right direction for you. They’ve shown that they’re fighting, they’ve been fighting the whole season, and sometimes things haven’t gone our way. “Fortunately, more recently, things have started to edge our way, which is nice.” There are still steps that City need to take and ways they can get better, too. The first half on Saturday, slow and under the cosh, has happened a few times this season, most recently in the Manchester derby last week. On that occasion, Taylor’s side again came from a goal down at the break. There are big players to return too, be it winger Chloe Kelly, one of only two players to hit double figures for goals and assists in the league last year, or Steph Houghton, the leader and captain of this team who lifted the Conti Cup on Saturday with her crutches. “It’s difficult sometimes when you've played against Chelsea previously and suffered a little bit, like we have this season, but I think the league game recently showed that we were getting closer in an OK display,” Taylor said. “But I think what this gives us goes beyond winning this trophy. I think it really gives us real confidence going into the remainder of the season. “Our objectives are really clear on what we want to try and do, what we want to try and achieve after having a difficult start. The belief levels will be huge after this because it just gives the players so much confidence.” This was a glimpse into what Taylor’s reign at City can bring. Now, It’s about how he and his side take that forward.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/shock-champions-league-exit-winning-major-trophy-manchester-city-/blt8681f89e7d4c5e81,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5227,'I'd love to finish my career in the NWSL with Gotham' – Rosette eyes US return after life-changing European experience,"When most young soccer players sign their first professional contracts, it is not usually for a club over 6,000 miles away. Sam Rosette had graduated college in the United States and was talking to her parents about an offer she’d got.  “Wait…” her mother said. “That’s like the farthest away. Like, so far.” Rosette’s destination was BIIK Shymkent in Kazakhstan, a regular Women’s Champions League club that has become a hotspot for American graduates in recent years. “You think it's not that far and then you look at a map and it's like, 'Oh my gosh,'"" Rosette tells GOAL. “Then, add like the whole ocean between England and America… “My mom kind of freaked out for a bit, but she was so supportive. They were excited for me. They were like, 'Wow, you have this opportunity!'"" Rosette knew her path would have to take her to Europe.  She started her college career at the University of Virginia, which provided the NWSL with its No.1 picks in the 2015 and 2016 Drafts, with future World Cup winners Morgan Gautrat and Emily Sonnett. “It's just such a competitive environment,” she explains. That Rosette played alongside no fewer than nine future NWSL draft picks during her time there says it all. “They have some of the best players in the country coming in every single year. It's hard to get your foot in the door if you're not coming in with that big name of like, 'Yeah, I play on the youth national team' or have done this, this and this. “I was coming from the Bronx and I knew it was a stretch and I knew I was going to be competing for spots my entire time I was there.” After getting good minutes under her belt at Villanova University while doing her master’s degree, she knew she’d have to venture abroad to make a name for herself. “Playing in the U.S. is amazing, but you have 12 teams right now,” Rosette says. “Think about how many collegiate teams there are with players that could potentially play professionally. There are so many players competing for those very few number of spots. “To get to play in Europe, you get to experience the rest of the world and new cultures and, honestly, going to Europe and experiencing soccer culture over there is just like a whole other experience too. ""It's good in the U.S. but when you go somewhere like England or some other countries, even just to visit, it's so amazing to see the love for the game that they have there and how ingrained it is into their cultures. “I wouldn't put it second to the NWSL. I think it's just kind of what you make of it. It works for some people, some people it's really hard to be that far away from home. I get both, but I personally really enjoy it.” Venturing out to Europe has allowed her to fulfil a dream by playing in the Champions League, which she remembers watching “a ton of” as a child. “I was a big Premier League fan,” she says. “I'm a huge Manchester United fan, and have been since I was really young. Wayne Rooney is quite literally my hero.  ""I watched a lot of European football as a kid. I think part of that is because, growing up in New York City, you have a really international community. ""People love soccer here and pick-up games are all over with people from hundreds of different countries, speaking five to 10 different languages in the same pick-up match. “I got a very international introduction to soccer, which can be different for a lot of people in the U.S. coming from different states and cities and such. ""I think that was partially why I tended to go towards Europe as well, because I knew it better just from my soccer experience growing up.” Now, she’s adding another country to her CV, playing in Lithuania for another UWCL regular, Gintra.  Also on that CV of hers is time with the reserve team at NWSL club Gotham FC, which gave her a taste of another future dream. “The coaches that we worked with at the reserves were excellent coaches and I learned so much just in my short time of working with them,” she remembers. “I hope I get to work with them in the future, more. “Great coaches, great players, a really professional environment, which is the perk of being connected to an NWSL programme. You really felt that professionalism, which was really cool to be a part of. “I want to play in the best possible league that I can get to overseas, but my ultimate goal, I would love to finish my career in the NWSL playing for Gotham. “I just kind of feel like it would be full circle to be able to come back after having this great experience in Europe and play for my home city. “It would be really, really cool, but I'm not quite ready to give up that experience in Europe yet.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/finish-career-nwsl-gotham-rosette-uwcl-adventure/blt07e29820cd02f78a,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5265,‘World-class Kerr has set the bar so high for Australian women’s football’ – Matildas team-mate Carpenter hails Chelsea star,"Chelsea’s “world-class” Sam Kerr has set the bar ""so high” for women’s football in Australia, says Matildas team-mate Ellie Carpenter. Carpenter is one of the country’s many stars now plying their trade at a top European club, having joined seven-time Women’s Champions League winners Lyon in 2020 – helping them retain the trophy shortly afterwards. But the defender was keen to pick out the contributions of Kerr in the rise of the game in Australia, adding that she is “very honoured” to play alongside the national team’s all-time top goalscorer. Speaking in an exclusive interview with GOAL, Carpenter said: “There's so much that we can achieve now, being an Australian international and with the team as well. “You look at Sam and I think she's done so much for women's football, especially in Australia. She's moved the bar so high. ""I think she's a world-class player and she's paved the way for us. I'm very honoured to be her team-mate, as well. “There's so much opportunity for us now as Australian players. We have the backing of so many people in Australia and the support is like none other. ""I think you can see that with the funding and the camps and the oppositions we're now playing on home soil. We can bring USA out. We can bring Brazil out. “The opportunity is there for us to be a world-class team and top five in the world, and that's what we're building towards. ""Then, individually, we have a lot of our players now in big clubs in Europe. We're trying to push the bar even higher and then inspire the next generation of Australians to do that also.” Despite being only 21, Carpenter believes she is someone that can help the next generation too. Having made her senior club debut at home at 15, then moved to the NWSL in the United States at 18, she has a lot of experience already. “When I came into the Matildas set-up, I don't think there was anyone playing in Europe or at a big European club,” she said. “For those young girls coming in and seeing so many of us playing at those clubs, it only inspires them. ""I look back and if I came into the team and I saw someone at Lyon or someone at Chelsea, I think I would idolise that person. I would just want to be like them. “I think it's so special now that we have so many of us at big clubs and it's just going to help the next generation. ""I feel so proud and lucky that I am that person that people can look at or look up to and proud that I am paving the way almost, even though I am still quite young. “I do speak to the [young Australian] girls a lot. I do tell them that going overseas for me at that age was the best thing that I've ever done. “I definitely tell them that if they do have the opportunity, then I think they should embrace that.” Those opportunities are not just in Europe or in North America anymore, either. Earlier this year, the new, fully-professional WE League began in Japan, as the growth of women’s football in Asia continues. Carpenter’s enthusiasm about that growth is clear from her involvement with the SingaCup, an event in Singapore that gives young boys and girls the chance to participate in several footballing activities. Her words also show that she is looking to continue to push the game forward in Asia, like players such as Kerr have done. “Having so many good leagues near Australia now, in the Asian Confederation, it's going to help the football grow,” she added. “Imagine in two or three years, especially after the World Cup [in Australia and New Zealand], there are going to be many more opportunities and leagues that are growing. It's a very, I would say, prime time in women's football. “No matter where you come from – Australia, Singapore, Japan – I just want to let people know that there is opportunity out there for women, especially in football.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/world-class-kerr-set-bar-australian-women-football-matildas/blt12645a18ad07364a,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

The process will narrow down the bids, of which six are known to GOAL, to just three, and those will be pored over in more detail by lawyers at Chelsea and the Premier League. There have been several late changes to bids permitted since the Friday, March 18 9pm GMT (5pm ET) deadline which has slowed the process down slightly. Raine Group is hoping to make the decision on which bidders will go to the next stage of the process by Tuesday, March 22. Joe Ravitch, who is the co-founder of investment bank Raine Group LLC, was initially asked by Abramovich to find a new owner for his club. After Abramovich was sanctioned by the United Kingdom and European Union, the group was instructed to continue its work to find a new owner.  It works in consultation with Abramovich, the UK Government through the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and the senior staff at Chelsea. Although the eventual owner of Chelsea is currently not known by anybody, there are feelings around the process that a United States consortium will win. Even still, those from other countries are not giving up, with Centricus going public about their offer to buy Chelsea which is thought to be worth a whopping £3 billion ($3.9bn). The London-based global investment firm is being led by co-founder Nizar Al-Bassam and CEO Garth Ritchie. It is working with hedge fund manager Jonathan Lourie of Cheyne Capital, and Talis Capital’s Bob Finch, who are all said to be long-time Chelsea season-ticket holders. Their plans include investing in the first team, academy, women's team and Chelsea Foundation. They have also outlined their intention to keep the current management running the club at all levels. There are also more details emerging of Nick Candy's bid, which is in partnership with investors from Europe, the United States and South Korea. He has named his group the Blue Football Consortium £2bn ($2.6bn) and he promises a high level of fan involvement, including the issuing of a 'golden share' in the club, voting rights and an advisory board for supporters. The proposal also involves former Blues striker Gianluca Vialli and his company Tifosy Capital & Advisory. PrimaryBid, a tech platform, is in discussions about facilitating those ideas on behalf of Candy's consortium. Alongside Candy, there's offers from the US led by the Ricketts Family, who own the Chicago Cubs, and Todd Boehly, who owns the Los Angeles Dodgers, has created a consortium with Hansjorg Wyss and Jonathan Goldstein. Furthermore, as first revealed by GOAL, Saudi Media believes its bid to buy Chelsea is competitive and is awaiting further details from Raine. From the UK, Lord Sebastian Coe has put together a proposal with former Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton. John Terry is the public face of the True Blues consortium which is offering to buy 10 per cent for £250 million ($329m). Now, as a minority partner, they aren't officially allowed to negotiate with Raine so their inclusion in any bid will be a 'bolt on' allowing any player a vehicle for fan involvement in the process. That means that they must negotiate with the preferred bidders once they are revealed. Despite going public about the bid on Saturday, not all the details have been released to Blues supporters, but the group has several private backers. Alongside that, they are promising to issue fan tokens with voting rights to wealthy supporters. Chelsea are hoping to complete this process as soon as possible with the club remaining under sanctions through their owner Roman Abramovich who was said to have connections to Russia's president Vladimir Putin by the UK Government.

5286,The end of Hegerberg's Norway 'nightmares': Why the superstar striker is back at the Euros,"Three years ago, when France hosted the 2019 Women’s World Cup, the best player in the world was not there – even though her nation, Norway, was. Ada Hegerberg collected the first ever Ballon d’Or Feminin just six months before the tournament kicked off, but she wouldn’t be showcasing her talents at what would be the women’s game’s biggest international event to date. Her absence was not due to injury, nor was it a shock omission from the squad. It was through choice. It was out of protest. “If the national team is to achieve the goals and results the national team management has set, in my opinion, improvements are required in several areas, in the planning work, in the implementation phase and in the follow-up,” Hegerberg wrote shortly after Euro 2017.  “In addition, there is a lot to go on in relation to communication and dialogue. “I have felt proud to play for the national team but, as the situation is, I have no motivation to continue now.” In an interview with Aftenposten, she added that “women's football does not have the respect it's supposed to have in Norway”, while she told magazine Josimar: “It was tough at so many camps. I have been broken mentally. I had nightmares after being with the national team. You shouldn’t have things like that.” For many years, the Norwegian Football Federation (NFF) tried to bring her into the team again, but to no avail – that was until a few months ago. In March, Hegerberg announced that she would return to international football, four months before this summer's Women's Euros. So, why now? Why is this the right moment to make her comeback? One factor that Hegerberg has talked about is gaining a new perspective while on the sidelines with an ACL injury, from January 2020 to October 2021.  Perhaps more significantly, though, is that Lise Klaveness became the NFF’s first female president a few weeks before the striker committed to returning. Who she is and what she stands for is incredibly important in this tale. When Hegerberg decided to stop representing her country, Klaveness wrote no fewer than 2500 words in an article for NRK, expressing her support. ""No in-depth analysis is needed to conclude that Ada Hegerberg is right in her criticism of the sports program,” read one sentence. ""Demanding quality in a top sports environment is essential for progress and should not be confused with a lack of humility,” read another. Klaveness is someone who stands up for what is right. Shortly after taking her new role, she went viral for a speech at the FIFA congress, hitting out at the decision to allow Qatar to host this year’s World Cup. Lise Klaveness kom med skarp kritikk mot FIFA-toppene på torsdagens FIFA-kongress i Qatar.Se hele talen på https://t.co/oz9Fryjwa3! pic.twitter.com/dvm8SSKfmc ""Human rights, equality, democracy, the core interests of football, were not in the starting 11 until many years later,"" she said.  ""There is no room for employers who do not secure the freedom and safety of World Cup workers. ""No room for leaders that cannot host the women's game. No room for hosts that cannot legally guarantee the safety and respect of LGBTQ+ people coming to this theatre of dreams."" Hegerberg later described the speech as “one of the greatest moments in sports history”, praising the “courage, wisdom and guts” involved. “She has been very clear that there have been a lot of changes in the system, new people in that have helped create new dynamics,” the Lyon star told the Guardian about her conversations with Klaveness. “Ultimately, we could have talked about the situation forever, but it’s all about being in this together now.  ""I want to be a part of it again and to try and help lift things even more, because obviously there’s always more to do. ""I know that a lot of things have been improved – in terms of the conditions that create an environment where girls’ and women’s football is actually in a position to develop.  ""Now, it’s up to me to see it by really taking part myself.” It’s some time for Norway to get her back.  After 21 months out, she was back on the pitch shortly after the 2021-22 season began and would go on to produce some incredible form as she found her feet again after so long away. A phenomenal header in the second leg of Lyon’s Champions League semi-final at Paris Saint-Germain was a stand-out moment – but she also struck again in the final as the French giants secured an eighth European title by beating Barcelona in May. ""Ada is just a winner. The girl is crazy in that respect,"" former Lyon team-mate Lucy Bronze, whom she will face in the group stages with England, said last month. ""I can remember games where she’d come up to me beforehand and say, 'You just get the ball in the box and I’ll score.'"" This summer is another opportunity for Hegerberg to show everyone that she is well and truly back, if there really is anyone out there who still doesn’t believe it yet. “Her coming back, I think that's incredible before the Euros,” Norway international Julie Blakstad told GOAL recently. “We really need her. I think we have a good team now if everyone is fit.” But it’s not just good for the present, for Norway’s chances in England or heading into the World Cup next year.  It’s a big moment for the future of this nation, one which routinely produces world-class talent but hasn’t won a title since a gold medal at the 2000 Olympic Games. There is still a long way to go before things in Norway are where she, Klaveness and many others would like it to be, but her decision to pull the country’s colours on again is an incredibly promising sign for the future.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/end-hegerberg-norway-nightmare-superstar-striker-back-euros/blte7f01c3fdc70d914,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

5367,'Complete f*cking foolishness!' - Arsenal legend Wright slams Alan Sugar for criticism of Women's Euros coverage,"Ian Wright has slammed Alan Sugar on Twitter after the latter's suggestion that the Arsenal legend landed a commentator's job with BBC Sport because of his complaint about an all-female commentary team during the ongoing Women's European Championship.  Sugar made the claim on social media over the weekend, despite the fact that Jonathan Pearce had already been commentating on the Euros for the BBC. Wright has now issued a scathing response to Sugar, calling the business mogul out for his ""complete f*cking foolishness"". On Saturday evening, Alan Sugar wrote on the micro-blogging platform Twitter that there should be a male commentator on the Women's Euros broadcasting team.  I am watching the women football and notice that ALL the comentators are women. I also note when mens football is on there is a symobilic female comentator to cover the broadcasters arse. Should I complain there should me a male commentator in women's football However, he then noticed that Ian Wright was on commentary during the England versus Norway fixture on Monday night, and went on to take credit for the former Gunners striker getting the job. I was pleased to see my old mate Ian Wright was given the opportunity to commentate on the ladies game last night. I wonder if my earlier tweet below touched a nerve. Of course  BBC sport will say not at all, Ian was already lined up for it @IanWright0 https://t.co/WgYGjWXWK4 After going through the tweets, Ian Wright responded befittingly to Sugar, the former Tottenham chairman.  Wright said via his own Twitter account: ""Can everyone please just stop sending me the Alan Sugar tweet. I was taking my daughter to singing lessons and the tweet is blowing up, it’s doing my head in, I can’t believe it.  ""Alan, the thing is, my friend, rather than just saying 'I got it wrong, lots of men are working at all levels of the tournament' you double-downed on some complete f*cking foolishness. ""In your mind, you actually thought that after you sent that tweet, the BBC phoned me up. Never mind the fact that we’ve been ready to do this for a year, I’ve been booked for a year. ""You genuinely think that they called me up and said, 'Ian, you’ve got to get back from Germany ASAP, Alan Sugar’s tweeted and we can’t upset him, we need to get you on!' https://t.co/gD7uivbko8 pic.twitter.com/rdzCudtYrv ""You genuinely believe that happened? I need to know! Because that says to me your ego is totally out of control. ""Where’s the people around you to hug you bro? You need some hugs man. Coming on Twitter for attention like this, it’s laughable. Stop doing it to yourself. ""But I’ve got to say, thank you for that tweet, because if it wasn’t for you I’d have missed one of the greatest England games that’s ever been played! ""In all seriousness, I’m glad you’re watching and the only thing you can find fault with doesn’t even exist. ""I sit in rooms with ex-players belittling the women’s game all the time. I’m so glad it annoys you and all of them."" He concluded: ""I hope you enjoy the rest of the tournament. Can you please tweet again so I can work Friday? Please?

5392,Mexico finally declares war on homophobic 'p*to' chant - but it may be impossible to win,"Last month, the Mexican FA - otherwise known as Femexfut or FMF - announced their intention to hand out five-year bans to supporters who sing anti-gay chants during national team games. While this looks like an admirable attempt to make El Tri games more welcoming and inclusive, it is actually a belated attempt by the FMF to deal with an issue which has plagued the Mexican game for more than two decades. Football authorities in the North American country have struggled to eradicate certain offensive terrace chants over recent years, particularly one shouted when opposition keepers take a goal kick - ""p*to"". The chant is shouting this word, which is a derogatory term for a male prostitute in colloquial Spanish. It is similar to the 'rent boy' chants which have caused problems in English football for years. For Mexico, choruses of ""p*to"", particularly prevalent when the men's national team play, have led to them being sanctioned by FIFA. These punishments have also seen the FMF begin to campaign against the chant - having ignored it for years prior. 'P*to' chants were heard last summer when Mexico played Canada in the Gold Cup, causing the game to be stopped. In June 2021, FIFA hit Mexico with a $65,000 fine and forced them to play two official home matches behind closed doors following homophobic chants during an Olympic qualifier. This ban on fans was eventually reduced, though Tata Martino's side played their recent World Cup qualifiers against Costa Rica and Panama in front of just 2,000 supporters. The issue being pushed onto the global stage forced the FMF to take action. A statement last month read: “The Mexican Football Federation reiterates its position of zero tolerance for any offensive or discriminatory comments in the stadiums."" FMF president Yon De Luisa added: “With these measures - added to the previous efforts, which we will continue to carry out - we seek to end discriminatory acts, to stop affecting our national team and to punish the responsible people and not the majority of our fans, who already understand that the chants do nothing but affect us all. “We cannot tolerate discriminatory acts, we cannot play in empty stadiums, we cannot put the soccer authorities at risk of taking away points or affecting our sports performance. ""We invite our great fans, who want to support the national team, to adopt these measures that allow us to count on their support in all the games.” The FMF has released official videos on its social media channels condemning the chant, with players and notable Mexican football figures on camera speaking out against it. ""The 'p*to' chant is in our past, because it is no longer part of our values as a nation,"" the narrator says on another clip. ""Our identity is our national team. ""Let's stop chanting that one word, so we can chant many more. Let's chant for the Mexico of today."" Yet this is hardly a new phenomenon. Mexican supporters are thought to have started the chant during the late 1990s and early 2000s, when an opposing goalkeeper is preparing to take a goal kick. Retired Mexican stopper Oswaldo Sanchez has said he was hearing ""p*to"" when he took goal kicks as far back as 1999, although he shrugged it off as with most other heckles from opposition fans. ""It really made me laugh,"" Sanchez said in the 2019 interview. ""I don't see it as homophobic, or offensive. Mexican people understand the word is used to have fun."" The April 19, 2004 edition of the Mexican newspaper Reforma, mentions the chant when describing a match between Necaxa and Veracruz in Aguascalientes where visiting manager Tomas Boy shoved a ball boy. “The fans didn’t tolerate that rudeness,” the report stated, “and skewered him with shouts of ‘p*to, p*to, p*to.’” Guys, this is serious, if you chant something offensive, you're out!!🗣🚫Let's end this right now for the love of the game!!🇲🇽⚽️#SupportWithoutOffending pic.twitter.com/DMRPLEzovu We're Mexicans and we're better than this!!🇲🇽💪🏽Time to end the offensive chant!!🗣🚫#SupportWithoutOffending pic.twitter.com/rGcpT5wn6P It has even been heard on the biggest stage in football; Mexico fans used it at the 2006 World Cup in Germany, while Brazilian supporters used it against El Tri at the 2014 tournament. In total, FIFA has fined the FMF and the Mexican national team 15 times over the years for offensive chanting - after almost every major game - with fines totalling 4.5 million pesos($227,000), according to Marca. Similar to the 'rent boys' situation, supporters have taken up staunch defences of the chant, usually on grounds of free speech, cultural context, and hypocrisy from FIFA, rather than out of homophobia. ""Context and connotation is important,"" one Mexico fan told ESPN last year. ""Clearly, people aren't chanting at goalkeepers and attacking them for thinking they're gay. ""[FIFA] is riding the wave of political correctness. I think it's pathetic for them on one hand to have a World Cup in Qatar and on the other, sanction Mexico for a chant they perceive as discriminatory."" The battle over 'p*to' reflects, and to some fans is secondary to, the issues Mexico are having on the pitch, where their ageing side are often deployed with overly defensive tactics and have been outshone in CONCACAF qualifying by bright, young sides from Canada and the United States. A crucial point here, however, is that LGBT+ players have spoken out against it. ""Soccer itself is a medium for change, and we need to recognize how impactful language can be,"" Janelly Farias, a defender on Mexico's women's national team who is gay, told ESPN. ""When people are using homophobic language, whether it's intentional or not, it can be very detrimental."" This is the nub of the issue - Mexican fans, through casual and ingrained homophobia, are making their own players feel uncomfortable, thus lessening their ability to play to their full potential and ultimately harming Mexico's chances in big games and tournaments. Hefty stadium bans and dire warnings about possibly missing out on World Cups are signs of progress, but it will be immensely difficult for FIFA or the FMF to turn around decades of fan behaviour, their protective attitude to one of their prized chants, and the ingrained culture of Mexican footballing fandom. The harder the authorities push, the more likely we are to hear the 'p*to' chant - at least in the short term. Whether it will have an impact long term, we shall have to wait and see.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mexico-homophobic-puto-chant/bltf3ff23c7d060c178,Emma Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5394,"‘Running off the pitch with missiles in the air was crazy’ - Butterfield's path through Israel, injury & NWSL","It was May 2021 and what would become an 11-day conflict had just broken out between Israel and Palestine. Kori Butterfield was playing for Israeli side Bnot Netanya and they were going out to train.  “We’re in the safest part of Israel,” the coach told the team. “Missiles never get to us.” “Thirty minutes later, the sirens are going off and there's hundreds of missiles in the air as we're running off the field,” Butterfield tells GOAL.  “And our bomb shelter was locked. We had to just hide against the buildings. “It's probably the craziest thing to happen in my life, to run off the field with missiles in the air.” Some players would leave the next day. Training wouldn’t take place again for a while either, until the missiles moved away from the area. “So many of the girls were like, 'Oh, this happens. This isn't anything new'. But they didn't realise it was going to be that long,” Butterfield remembers, having had no warning about this kind of scenario before the move. “One day, two months after we moved there, we heard these loud booms and the whole foundation kind of shook.  ""I messaged one of the girls that lived there and was like, 'Hey, what was that?' She replied with: 'We're at war, baby!' “It's something in my career that I don't think a lot of other people are going to experience!” That’s a snippet of the crazy journey Butterfield has had to date.  She's in Greece now, where she's played Women's Champions League football and is surrounded by a “hauntingly beautiful” fan culture. Playing for PAOK, one of the country’s biggest clubs, she feels the passion even more. Her route to this point has been far from straightforward. Ranked among the top five goalkeepers in the United States when at the University of Tampa, despite playing in the second tier of college competition, she was “excited to see where that could take [her]”. However, she didn't get the chance. In her senior year, she tore three ligaments in her knee and had to have a double knee reconstruction. “It was the roughest year pretty much of my life,” Butterfield says. “Two months before my knee injury, I lost my best friend in a car accident.  ""Then two months later, I tore three ligaments in my knee and my career was over for quite a while.  ""Two months after that, my parents got a divorce. “It was a really lonely time throughout that period, and I really didn't know if I was ever going to get back into soccer, especially because so many people were telling me it was going to take too long for me to get back, that it just wasn't going to happen.  ""But I finally found a goalkeeper coach to help me.” Butterfield has since seen that she can reach the elite level. She earned opportunities with both the Washington Spirit and OL Reign in NWSL, the latter of which “really showed me what it's like to be professional”. “To be able to say that I played with some of the top women in the world - Megan Rapinoe, Jodie Taylor, Casey Murphy – I cannot believe that I was with them. I really hope I get a chance to do it again,” she says. “Some of them are just so inspirational. They not only inspire me and people they play with, they inspire the world. I think that's something truly amazing.  ""Especially when I wasn't at the level yet of Reign and to have Jodie Taylor coming to me after training and saying, 'Hey, if you need me to help you do extra work, I'm here for you', I think that's amazing. “I definitely got a little starstruck, especially with Megan Rapinoe. She's been an idol for so many people. “After each training with Reign, we had a five-minute 'do whatever you want’ type of thing and Megan was like, 'Kori, come get in goal for me.' I was like, 'Oh my god, she knows my name!' “There was another training session where I did a beautiful diving parry out to the side from Allie Long’s shot. Those things, you just remember for the rest of your life. “At the same time, you have to know you're a professional and you can't be [starstruck]. You can admire, but you can't lose your focus and you have to understand you're at the same level as them. You have to present yourself like that as well. “I've played with these women that are at such a top level and maybe they don't know my name, and that's okay, but I was still able to learn from them. “That keeps me going as well, because if I played with them and I played underneath them, then I can do that job and I can be at that same level, when it's my time.” Since being at Reign, Butterfield’s eyes have really opened. She’s taken on that mentor role that she benefited from having around her in the NWSL too, even if it can be “a little bit of a struggle” in Greece. “I think every single player is a little bit selfish in that they obviously want to help themselves get better and if the level is not high enough, it is a little bit hard,” she explains. “But you just have to take a step back and be like, 'Okay, this is a stepping stone. This may not be where you're going to end, but this is where you are now, and you have to make the best of it.' “I always told myself, I have to go to Europe to make a name for myself since I couldn't do it straight out of college.  ""I figured that's the only way that I'm going to be able to make a name for myself, to be able to get back to the States. “I've always had that mindset to just keep climbing up the ladder, no matter what opportunity I get, it's going to be a step forward. It really has been quite the journey. “At this stage of my career, I want the highest level I can get to and I'm going to keep working towards that.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/missiles-butterfield-path-israel-injury-nwsl-europe/blt46c0bbc269956378,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5396,"Everton suspend sponsorships with Russian companies USM, Megafon and Yota after Usmanov has assets frozen","Everton have suspended sponsorship arrangements with three Russian companies following the invasion of Ukraine. The Toffees had commercial partnerships with Russian companies USM, Megafon and Yota, however, these have all now been temporarily stopped as the club take a stance on the conflict. It comes after Alisher Usmanov, once a shareholder at Arsenal but who now boasts strong links to Everton, has seen his assets in the EU frozen as a result of “close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin”. A statement released by the club on Wednesday read: ""Everyone at Everton remains shocked and saddened by the appalling events unfolding in Ukraine. ""This tragic situation must end as soon as possible, and any further loss of life must be avoided. ""The players, coaching staff and everyone working at Everton is providing full support to our player Vitalii Mykolenko and his family and will continue to do so. ""The club can confirm that it has suspended with immediate effect all commercial sponsorship arrangements with the Russian companies USM, Megafon and Yota."" The Uzbek-born billionaire is among those facing sanctions on the back of Russia’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. Usmanov is a close friend of Toffees owner Farhad Moshiri, but is now banned from entering EU territory or conducting business in it, with measures being put in place to limit powers of the Kremlin and its associates. The European Council announced on Monday that ""26 persons"" had been added to a list of names facing financial and business-related sanctions. These included Usmanov, who has been named as a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch with particularly close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin"" within regulations updated in the Official Journal of the European Union. That document adds: ""(Usmanov) has been referred to as one of Vladimir Putin’s favourite oligarchs. He is considered to be one of Russia’s businessmen-officials, who were entrusted with servicing financial flows, but their positions depend on the will of the President."" Usmanov, who was previously the second-biggest stakeholder at Arsenal behind Stan Kroenke, is the majority shareholder of MegaFon – a company Everton owner Moshiri has a stake in. MegaFon and Russian smartphone company Yota are the sponsors of the Toffees' women's team. Usmanov is also the founder of holdings corporation USM, who have been sponsors of Everton’s Finch Farm training ground since 2017. They also boast a £30 million ($40m) naming rights option on the club’s proposed new stadium, which is due to be opened ahead of the 2024-25 season.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/everton-usmanov-assets-frozen-russia-president-putin-ukraine/bltc83f5020ab38e4da,Emma Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Putellas won the award after inspiring Barca to glory in the 2020-21 season, and was equally impressive in the club's latest campaign as they reached a second successive final. The Blaugrana were unable to retain the trophy after losing 3-1 to Lyon in the showpiece event, but Putellas has picked up a consolation prize in the form of her second Player of the Year accolade. Putellas finished this season's competition as top scorer with 11 goals to her name, including Barca's solitary effort in the final. The 28-year-old also recorded two assists to bring her up to a total of 13 goal involvements, more than any other player, and managed to find the net in eight of her 10 appearances in the latest edition of the Champions League. Putellas hit over 30 goals across all competitions for Barca this term and will once again be a contender for the Ballon d'Or Feminin later this year, having won the award for the first time in 2021. 🔝💫 The 2021/22 #UWCL 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐨𝐧, chosen by UEFA's Technical Observer panel is...🇪🇸 @alexiaputellas 👏#UWCLfinal | @FCBfemeni Lyon midfielder Henry landed Goal of the Season for her spectacular long-range strike against Barcelona, which set the French side on their way to victory in the final at the Juventus Stadium in Turin.

5418,From scandal to success: How Barcelona helped transform Spanish women's football,"When Spain arrived in Canada for their first ever Women’s World Cup in 2015, they did so just two days before their first game and without having played a match for two months. With preparation like that, they stood no chance, and inevitably fell at the first hurdle, eliminated in the first round after finishing bottom of their group. Fast forward seven years and they are the bookmakers’ favourite for the Women’s Euros, a Spanish club, Barcelona, has won the Champions League and a Spanish player, Alexia Putellas, the Ballon d’Or. The comparison between now and then is like night and day, but if it wasn’t for what those in 2015 did, that progress is unlikely to have occurred. Vero Boquete is one of the best players Spain has ever produced. She was one of the players many were excited to watch at that Canadian World Cup.  After the tournament ended, she was also one the players at the forefront as the team took their complaints with the federation public. “We believe that we have reached the end of an era and change is required,” a statement from the players read.  Later, allegations of bigotry, sexism and homophobia would be made against head coach Ignacio Quereda, who left his role in 2015 after 27 years in charge.  This period would be one of the most important in this team’s evolution. “After that, everything changed,” Boquete tells GOAL. “A new coach, a new sporting director, better conditions in the flights and preparation, better knowledge. It was a little of everything, but it was a big change. “Before, we didn't have the best people around. When you don't have the best people around, it's in the day-by-day, but also it is in taking decisions to make the league stronger or to improve the clubs or to improve the federation to give better conditions. We didn't have that for so many years.” “In the Spanish national team training ground, we had a different pitch and it just started from that,” adds Vicky Losada, captain of Barcelona’s treble-winning team in 2020-21. “For people, it can be a silly thing, but every day you want the best conditions. We started training on the best pitch in the training ground at reasonable times, not late. “In terms of travelling, it was better. For me, it was more about the preparations. We had more people in the staff, qualified people and then we started preparing well with big games against big national teams. “In the end, you have to prepare against the best teams if you want to be one of the best. It all came also with the improvement of the teams in general. I think that environment started to be professional.” That growth of the Spanish league and its clubs is another incredibly important factor both Boquete and Losada pick out when reflecting on the progress.  Barcelona have led the way there, with the interest in and commitment to the women's team really starting to change after its first league title in 2012. Three years and six trophies later, the women turned professional. They joined the men’s team for pre-season tours. They had their own lucrative deal for a shirt sponsor.  They signed players to fit the club’s philosophy and built up the women’s academy, both of which would pave the way for the incredible success they are enjoying today. With such a large chunk of players from Barca playing for Spain, it directly benefited the national team. It also set a new standard for other clubs in the league to follow, while no doubt encouraging Real Madrid to enter the women’s game. “I still think that the Spanish league needs to keep growing, but it's true that teams like Real Madrid, Real Sociedad, teams that really have a name in the men's game, it's important that they invest in women's football,” says Losada, who is working for the BBC as a pundit during the Euros. “It was very important to have Real Madrid. It made a massive impact when you have El Clasico. That's a massive game in terms of TV, promotion, and also I think that [the club] is going to be professional and is going to let the players develop as professionals, which is what Spain needs to be a big team.” Alongside all of this has been the expansion and growth of the youth national teams, which are some of the best in the women’s game today.  Spain has won eight major tournaments at youth level since 2010, with its latest coming in July when the women’s under-19s won the Euros, making it three titles from the last four editions. The structure in Spain has been strong for a long time, meaning talents are spotted and brought into the national team set-up early, but it has improved a lot, too.  More teams have been added, more camps take place and the federation “already knows all the players that are coming [through]”, Boquete says. As a traditional footballing nation – and one of the very best, too – there has always been a lot of talent in Spain. Now, it is just being given a better environment to develop. “I think [the sub-federations] have improved so much and from really early ages are giving [players] really good development,” Losada explains.  “I think that's massive. Then when they are 15, they already come with bases that are even better than the one I had when I was 25! “You start with girls that understand the game and it's about giving them the perfect conditions to develop physically, mentally, and prepare them to basically [have] winning mentalities.” “It is just giving it some time because the players, we were always good in U17s, U19s, it was just a matter of time to be able to do it at the highest level,” Boquete adds.  “Those players are coming and some of them are now in the national team. We have a good mix with young and experienced players.” The final piece of this puzzle is the changes in society that have come, to allow more of this progress to take place and more of the obstacles Spanish women’s football has faced to fall. In 2019, 60,739 fans flocked to the Wanda Metropolitano to watch Atletico Madrid play Barcelona. Post-pandemic, it’s been Barca smashing those big records with sell-out crowds at Camp Nou. It’s not all rosy, though. After all, this isn’t happening every week at every game. There are still examples of teams not being treated as they should, too, such as Rayo Vallecano, who made headlines for all of the wrong reasons throughout the 2021-22 season due to a serious lack of resources and support. When GOAL speaks to Amanda Gutierrez, the president of FUTPRO, the women’s players’ association in Spain, the conversation is geared more towards what more needs to be done, rather than how triumphant the recent equal pay deal for the national teams is, one that she helped to secure. “Little has changed,” Gutierrez admits, speaking about attitudes in the country. “This agreement is historic, but there is still a lot to do and the institutions that manage football must take women's football more seriously. There is a lot of work left. “It is a great achievement because it lays the foundation for the future. From here, we can only improve the conditions, and it is a demonstration that the united players have strength and will not hesitate to fight for their rights. “We are now negotiating the collective agreement, which regulates the working conditions of the players in the new women’s league. We currently have an annual salary of €16,000 (£13,500/$16,3000) and if we want to be among the best leagues, we cannot have such precarious conditions.” The latter is a reminder of the stage that Spain is still at in its development. For many, they have been the outstanding favourite for this summer’s Euros, a prediction largely based on the rise of the league’s quality, Barcelona's success and the emergence of Putellas – who will sadly miss the tournament after rupturing her ACL on the eve of the first game – as the best player on the planet.  It's never just been about Putellas, though – Aitana Bonmati, Patri Guijarro, Mapi Leon and many more of her Barca team-mates are among the world's brightest stars. All of that makes it easy to forget that Spain has never won a knockout match at a major tournament in its history. Moreover, the team is not a replica of this well-decorated Barca side – there are many differences.  They could well win the Euros and the progress has been wonderful, but they are not the front-runner many make them out to be. “We have really good talented players, good talent, and I think it wasn't fair, for many years, not having the right conditions to give your best,” Losada says. “I think we still need time, if you compare Spain with Sweden, the Nordic teams, or maybe England. “I think we're doing things well, but the other teams have been doing them for longer. I think it's about time. Now, the young players are really good so I think the future is going to be brilliant.” “Even if Spain doesn't win the Euros,” Boquete concludes, “we are already on the right path.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rise-barcelona-spanish-women-football/bltde98c6b5e849e5a3,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Williamson also revealed that she was in attendance at the 2012 London Olympics group stage match where Great Britain beat Brazil in front of a 70,000-plus crowd. While she hopes for a similar turnout on Sunday, Williamson has also warned that the hype around women's football should not fall after the Euros final. ""I think tomorrow will be another moment like that. It's incredible that happened and I think the fall-off afterwards, we hope that's not what happens after this tournament,"" she added.

Everyone was in shock.” She laughs at the idea of ever imagining that sort of thing could happen as a little girl.  After all, this was a huge turning point for the women’s game in Italy – or, as Gazzetta dello Sport’s headline said, it was the summer in which calcio ‘discovered women’. Instead, when Galli was growing up just south of Milan, her idols were on the men’s side.  Her father and brother were fans of Inter and regulars at the games, so she would be too – despite her mother’s best efforts to make her a Juventus fan. “Twice, I was a mascot,” the 25-year-old remembers. “The first time was with Javier Zanetti, who is my idol. I was like a stone, just stuck in this way.  ""I didn't understand anything. I was maybe eight years old and I just looked around in San Siro and was like, 'Okay. I am very little!' “I don't have the picture, so I'm very angry about this with my dad!” 👏 Assist appreciation post 👏What a ball from Hanna Bennison... laying it on a 🍽 for Aurora Galli to score the matchwinner 🔥#BarclaysFAWSL @EvertonWomen pic.twitter.com/3UDI5hKPHd Fast forward a few years and, having earned a move to Juventus that made her mother “very happy”, the midfielder was primed to enjoy the incredible lift that Italian women’s football was about to receive. She was winning titles for fun with the Bianconere – picking up seven trophies in her four seasons with a side set to take huge steps in the Champions League. But instead of staying in Turin, she’d sign for Everton, becoming the first Italian to grace England’s Women’s Super League. Was it difficult to leave when she did? “Yes and no,” Galli explains. “Because I knew [Italy] was my comfort zone, so if I stayed there, I knew that probably this year I would win again, but it's not enough for me. “I want to improve all the time and if I stay in one place more than four years, it's like, every day I see the same people, the same things. I don't want this. I want to see new things. “The most important thing was my two friends, [Lisa] Boattin and [Arianna] Caruso, who are also my team-mates in the national team. We have a very good relationship so when I say to them, 'Okay, I'm leaving', they said, 'No, you stay here.' “I say, 'Okay, you can come with me. We can go to England together!'  ""But yes, I was really sure about my choice. I don't regret it.” She says that despite a season she and many more didn’t expect from Everton.  The club made nine signings last summer and was bullish in its desire to secure Champions League football. However, head coach Willie Kirk was sacked after three defeats in the opening five games – all at the hands of last season’s top three. In came Jean-Luc Vasseur, having won the Champions League with Lyon a year before, but he would suffer the same fate. Going into this final weekend of the WSL season, Everton are safe from relegation, but will either finish the campaign third or fourth from bottom. “I'm disappointed, of course,” Galli says, reflecting on her first year on Merseyside. “I arrived after four years of winning with Juventus, so it's a shock not to take the three points every weekend. “Changing two coaches is not good for the team and for the club, but I think also that for the group, it was a good thing, because now we can see the strong group.  ""I think that we have to improve our mentality to win, but it's a strong group. We stay together and this is our power, so I think that the next season will be good.” There are positives to take for her as an individual – learning a new language, improving as a player from the new experience and, most importantly, finding a good Italian restaurant. There are positives for the team, too, particularly in the chemistry they’ve built after so many new faces. “It was very hard to play together,” Galli admits looking back, but she’s since forged great relationships with her team-mates – especially fellow midfielder Kenza Dali. “It’s very easy to play with Kenza because she wants the ball,” she explains. “We have a very good connection - but also with the other girls, with Izzy [Christiansen], for example.  ""I really enjoy playing with her because she's the captain but also a very good person. On the pitch, she is very smart.” These new friendships are about to be tested, though. Galli will face Dali’s France in Italy’s opening game of this summer’s Euros, which the pair have already been joking about. She could then take on a trio of her Swedish club-mates in the quarter-finals and even more of the Everton group if Italy go further – something which many believe the team is capable of. If little ‘Yaya’, starstruck by Zanetti and San Siro, wouldn’t believe she’d become a professional footballer, play with Everton in a country where “football is the life” or get the hero’s reception she did after the World Cup three years ago, she certainly wouldn’t believe surpassing that at the Euros. “When I came back from the World Cup, it was just, 'Okay where am I?' Because it was a dream and I know that I want to do another dream,” she says. “If I have to say something to little Yaya, I want to say: 'Just do what you think and continue to follow your dream, because this is the key.' “My key is this: just follow my dream.”  It’s working so far.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/everton-italy-galli-juventus-zanetti-wsl-history/bltdaedaeef11bc798f,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5499,Watch: USWNT star Horan marks first Lyon start with Champions League assist and Macario scores wonder goal,"U.S. women’s national team midfielder Lindsey Horan marked her first start for Lyon with an assist on Thursday as the French club qualified for the semi-finals of the Women’s Champions League. Horan joined the club in late January, signing on loan from the Portland Thorns until June 2023. It meant a return to France after six years away, having played for Paris Saint-Germain for four seasons before moving back to the United States. USWNT team-mate Catarina Macario also continued to star as she has done since joining last January, scoring a sensational goal as Lyon progressed to the semis. Horan's inclusion in the starting XI on Thursday was one of three changes Sonia Bompastor made to her Lyon team from last week's UWCL quarter-final first leg, which Juventus won 2-1 in Turin. The 27-year-old has had a slow start to life with the seven-time European champions due to a knee injury, which also ruled her out of the 2022 SheBelieves Cup, but showed how effective she can be for this team on Thursday. It took the team 33 minutes to erase Juve’s lead, when Ada Hegerberg, the first ever Ballon d’Or Feminin winner, scored. Just two minutes later, Horan whipped in a superb cross for Melvine Malard and the forward headed it home to allow the French club to go ahead in the tie, leading 3-2 on aggregate.

There were 73 minutes on the clock when Delphine Cascarino played a ball into the box for the 22-year-old, who took it exceptionally well, turning her marker with an exquisite first touch before firing the ball into the back of the net. Juventus substitute Andrea Staskova would get a goal back for the visitors, but a 3-1 win for Lyon on the night made it 4-3 on aggregate and was enough to send the Champions League's most successive club into the last four of the competition, with them to face a familiar foe in PSG in next month's semi-finals.

Heath, a two-time World Cup winner and Olympic gold medallist with her country, started for the Gunners in Germany, having made an excellent impact from the bench in last week’s first leg. The 33-year-old drilled in a free-kick late on in that game that allowed centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy to equalise as the English club came from behind to get a 1-1 result. However it was a difficult night for Heath in the second leg, with the winger substituted at half-time as head coach Jonas Eidevall brought Caitlin Foord on in her place. Wolfsburg, twice European champions, ran out 2-0 winners in the end, with former Arsenal midfielder Jill Roord scoring after nine minutes before a cruel own goal from Leah Williamson in the second half added to the hosts’ lead.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/watch-uswnt-horan-lyon-champions-league-assist-macario/blt0302a7b548897c3e,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5521,USWNT legend Solo arrested for DUI,"Former USWNT goalkeeper Hope Solo has been arrested on charges relating to driving under the influence after she was found passed out behind the wheel of her car with her children in the vehicle. The ex-shot-stopper has been charged with driving while impaired, resisting a public officer and misdemeanor child abuse, and faces a court date on June 28. This is not the first time Solo has been charged in relation to DUI offences, having previously been a passenger in a vehicle when her husband Jerramy Stevens was found to be over the limit in 2015, leading to a 30-day suspension from the national set-up. Though Solo has not given official comment over the incident in North Carolina, Rich Nichols, a Texas-based attorney who represents her, released a statement Friday on the matter. He said: ""On the advice of counsel, Hope can't speak about this situation, but she wants everyone to know that her kids are her life, that she was released immediately and is now at home with her family, that the story is more sympathetic than the initial charges suggest, and that she looks forward to her opportunity to defend these charges."" Solo enjoyed a 13-year career between 2003 and 2016 that was marked as much by her on-field talents as a clutch of controversies off-field too. She won over 200 caps for the national team, and was a twice-Olympic Gold medalist, at Beijing 2008 and London 2013, with medal positions at three successive World Cups. In addition, she was named to both the IFFHS CONCACAF Woman Team of the Decade and the IFFHS World's Woman Team of the Decade for her exploits between the posts.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uswnt-legend-solo-arrested-for-dui/blt7be2a73a66f80fc6,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5529,'The start of a new era' - How Barcelona created a culture for the women's team to sell-out Camp Nou,"Two or three years ago, when Barcelona’s boys’ teams passed through the training centre, they would do just that. But something has changed. Today, you will see several young players hanging around, waiting for the likes of Alexia Putellas, Mapi Leon or Patri Guijarro to appear, so they can have a photo with one of the stars of the best women’s football team in Europe – and maybe the world. When Markel Zubizarreta, general manager of the Barca women’s team, explained as much in the build-up to Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Real Madrid, it highlighted another way in which the stature of this team has changed over the last seven years. On Wednesday, Barca Femeni will play in front of a sold-out Camp Nou against the club’s traditional rival, looking to continue its defence of the European title. Jonatan Giraldez’s side has already retained its league title, beating Real Madrid 5-0 to do so, and could do the treble again, having reached the semi-finals of the Copa de la Reina. Barcelona Femeni show off their league title at Camp Nou 🤩 pic.twitter.com/cKd2rGUxrE The growth of the women’s game is happening everywhere, with records tumbling as interest and investment soars, but should Barcelona’s stadium be filled on Wednesday, it would be something bigger than anything seen to date. The second leg of the Women's Champions League quarter-final between Barcelona and Real Madrid can be watched exclusively live on DAZN. Watch: Barcelona vs Real Madrid (English live stream) Watch: Barcelona vs Real Madrid (Spanish live stream) “I believe that tomorrow can be the start of a new era,” Putellas said in Tuesday’s pre-match press conference. “The match is going to be inspiring for so many girls that will be coming tomorrow to Camp Nou, who will be seeing us from TV, and they will see women playing in Camp Nou. “I am sure that in the mid or long run, we'll be collecting the fruit of tomorrow's match. Seeing women playing in Camp Nou, I'm sure that many, many girls will dream about being those girls, or women, in 20 years.” The build-up to this ""new era"" started back in 2015 when, after 13 years of being integrated with FC Barcelona, the women’s team turned professional. “As you have seen, in seven years, we have completely changed everything,” Zubizarreta said in a presentation this week. He is right. He clicked the mouse on his computer as he said these words, changing the slide to move on from the small team of people involved back then, to show all of the nutritionists, physios and others that help make up this all-conquering side today. That is part of what has helped Barca build such a successful team. The development of the academy, with young women living in La Masia now for the first time, is another reason. The investment in infrastructure and the resources that support the players is, too. One of the most impressive things about the build-up to Wednesday’s game, though, is how Barcelona has generated the level of interest in the women’s team to the point that it can sell out the Camp Nou in a matter of days. Camp Nou is completely sold out for the women's Clasico in March, after 85,000 tickets were sold in three days 🏟The average Camp Nou attendance for men's Barcelona games has been 46,299 this season. pic.twitter.com/uQ9j5y6BJq A similarly impressive feat is that Barca Femeni play their regular games in Estadia Johan Cruyff, a home they moved to in 2019. Previously, they played at the Mini Estadi, right next to Camp Nou. Moving to a new ground outside of the city should have reduced attendances but, instead, the team averages crowds around four times higher than before. “We are not a project of women's football,” Zubizarreta responded when asked how the club has achieved this growing fanbase. “We are a project of football.” A stroll through the city of Barcelona reinforces that idea. The endorsed advertisements around Camp Nou do not only have images of Gerard Pique or Ansu Fati, but also of Aitana Bonmati. Just as the Ballon d’Or triumphs of Luis Suarez, Johan Cruyff, Hristo Stoichkov and Lionel Messi are celebrated in the club museum, so is that of Putellas. In the club shop, there are eleven mannequins that stand to mimic the starting line-up of the men’s team. They wear the jerseys of Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Jordi Alba and so on. Mirroring the stance on the other side are eleven more – starting with Sandra Panos and ending with Mariona Caldentey. The feeling is that this club is proud of its women’s team just as it is proud of any other team in FC Barcelona colours. “That's something I really feel, that they value us as much as the men's team and that it's all about one club,” midfielder Ingrid Engen said this week. “I hope that shows to the rest of the world - because that's how it should be these days.” “You need to change minds,” Zubizarreta added. “That is the first thing and I think that in this club, these minds changed six or seven years ago.” To have a successful women’s team, you do need to have good players. You do need good infrastructure. You do need a good academy set-up. But you also need that pride in the team. You need to show people that it exists. You need to encourage people to support it and continue to spur it on to success. By doing so, you may also encourage the next wave of talent that will bring you success, and the cycle continues. Putellas said this week that she never dreamed of playing in Camp Nou. She went to the stadium to watch the team that she loves as a young girl, but she never even thought that she could be on that pitch. “We can open so many doors for so many girls and I feel very proud that Barca makes it possible, because I believe it will be a turning point in women's football in Barcelona, in Catalunya, in Spain, and hopefully all around the world,” she said. “At the end of the day, Barca is an international team. I believe we will broadcast an important message.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-created-culture-womens-team-sell-out-camp-nou/blt912940c2ab78d593,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

5535,‘She's taken Messi's place on the Pepsi bottles!’ - How Barcelona's Caroline Graham Hansen became the best winger in the world,"When Caroline Graham Hansen told Tresor Egholm, one of her first coaches and a close friend, that she was thinking of joining Barcelona, his response was: 'Why?' Graham Hansen reached two Champions League finals with Wolfsburg while winning seven domestic trophies in five seasons. The German giants were undoubtedly one of the best teams in the world, seen by seven-time European champions Lyon as their rival. ‘Yes, but Barcelona are telling me they're trying to become the best team in the world,’ she replied. ‘I really believe in this.’ Egholm questioned the strength of the Spanish league, but Graham Hansen again had faith in growth. ‘I think they are building it,’ she said. Fast forward three years – with Barcelona the holders of the Champions League trophy and the chance to retain it coming on Saturday in the final against Lyon – and Egholm laughs. “She was right and I was wrong!” he tells GOAL. “And I'm really glad.” UWCL final stream links 👇 English - https://bit.ly/BarcelonaLyonEN Spanish - https://bit.ly/BarcelonaLyonES French - https://bit.ly/BarcelonaLyonFR It’s certainly not the first time Graham Hansen, arguably the best winger in the world, has proved someone wrong over the years. It’s unlikely to be the last, either. Graham Hansen was born in Oslo, Norway, and played football for one of the city’s top clubs, Lyn. It didn’t have any girls’ teams when she started so she played for the boys alongside Mats Moller Daehli, the Norway international midfielder who is still one of her friends to this day. “I had heard that Mats was really, really good. They told me that there was a good girl there as well - but she probably wouldn’t make it with the boys when she gets older,” Egholm chuckles, recalling a memory now 17 years old. “I started working with them in the academy one or two times a week and she was outstanding. She was just the same level as Mats, both of them were really, really good players. “All the hints and tips we tried to teach her, she would pick it up so quickly. You could just give her more and more and more, and she would just pick up everything really fast. She had a really good understanding of the game.” Graham Hansen was so good she'd even play with the older boys' team – ""almost unheard of"" for a girl. But she would have to move on to a women’s team eventually. That team would be Stabaek, the Oslo-based club with the best women's side in Norway, a club she wowed first hand in a rare appearance for Lyn's under-16 girls a few months earlier. In late 2009, the team had reached their cup final, a game that would be hosted by Stabaek. Richard Jansen was the speaker at the club's games and he was happy to occupy that role here, too. It was another job that he wasn’t so keen on, though – picking player of the match. Fortunately, it would be one of the easiest jobs he will probably ever have. “Because Lyn had Caroline,” he laughs. “She won the match for Lyn on her own, even though Lyn had a good team. She was outstanding. She was better than all the other players.” After joining as a 15-year-old, Graham Hansen's time with Stabaek simply confirmed what everyone had heard about her. “I think she started on the bench for the two or three first matches, and then she played everything if she was not injured,” Jansen remembers. “We saw [her talent] right away. She just needed a couple of years in the gym to get some more muscles and then she would be world-class.” It was being seen outside of Norway, too. She was called up to the senior national team aged 16 and had her breakthrough major tournament just two years later, making five starts as her country reached the final of Euro 2013. Solveig Gulbrandsen played alongside the teenager that summer and was certainly one of those believing the hype. “I didn't know so much about her because she had played with boys for a long time and then suddenly, someone was talking about how there was a 15-year-old girl who was really, really good,” she remembers. “The first time I saw her, I was really thinking, 'I'm getting old!' The new players coming through are getting so technical. ""She had so many skills. Her technique is outstanding. She can do a lot of stuff with a ball that I can't do.” That ability was spotted by one of the most ambitious women’s football projects in the world. Swedish side Tyreso had the game’s greatest ever player, Marta; four U.S. women’s national team stars, including Christen Press; and two of the most talented players Spain has produced, in Vero Boquete and Jenni Hermoso. Now, they wanted Graham Hansen. “Before she arrived, they were telling us, ‘This Norwegian player, she’s really young, but we really believe that she is a fantastic player. She’s going to be one of the best’,” Boquete says. “She always wanted the ball and she would go against you. She was never afraid. I remember that already some players were like, ‘Wow, this player is so young and she wants to dribble at me!’ “When you see a player that young with no fear, wanting to show that she is already good, that means that she has already has character and ambition.” It was Graham Hansen’s second move abroad that really thrust her name into the conversation as one of the best wingers in the world, though. Forming wonderful on-pitch relationships with Pernille Harder and Ewa Pajor, her time with Wolfsburg saw her develop as a player, win trophies and gain tons of experience. Her game became more refined, too. “She is one of the rare ones – you can’t teach what she has,” Ella Masar, who played with the Norway international in Germany, explains. “I think at Wolfsburg, obviously you knew she had something special. You got to train with her every day. She showed up and did things I haven’t seen a women’s player do, minus probably Marta. “People don’t understand that she left home so young, that when she came into Wolfsburg in 2015, she was a kid. To go into that environment [at 19 years old] and thrive there for five years, that speaks to who she is. ""I had a hard time doing that for a year and a half and I was 30, 31. The sacrifices she’s made, no one will ever understand.” Those difficult times have also shaped her into who she is today. Graham Hansen's struggles with injuries in Germany were so much that she almost walked away from the game four years ago. Fortunately, she wouldn’t. Egholm recalls her returning to Norway at one point for some rehab and Moller Daehli being injured at the same time, which was “really good for her – but unlucky for Mats, of course,” he laughs. “One of your best friends training together with you and going through the same thing... I think that was really important for her.” “My family supported me, kept me calm and just said, 'Hey, take it easy. We will come back. Don't think so far ahead',” Graham Hansen told GOAL last summer of that time. “You kind of get a little bit scared that it can ruin the career [of a player],” Gulbrandsen, watching her former team-mate from afar at this point, adds. “I'm really, really happy that she made it through the injury time and is now doing so well.” It’s a sentiment shared by several people GOAL speaks to – and by fans of the game as a whole. That’s because this is an incredibly special player. It’s just a few days before Saturday’s Champions League final and a smile flashes across the face of Jonatan Giraldez, the Barcelona head coach, as he recalls one of the first times he watched Graham Hansen play after talks between her and the club had started. “It was unbelievable, the performance, the difference between her and the rest of the players,” he tells GOAL. “Two months later, I remember when she came to the club, we were talking about that game. She told me that her performance wasn’t amazing. For me, it was unbelievable! “Her first day, I remember one player told me, 'She is an amazing player'. We were only five minutes in! And doing a very easy exercise. ""But when the rhythm of the pass, the precision of the pass and the movement before and the timing is so good, when you are coming from another country… It is not so easy for the foreign players. And Caro had it.” Since then, she's won nine trophies in three years and the style of Barcelona and of Spain has added another element to her game. “In the beginning, in Tyreso, maybe she was more individual,” Boquete, who played against Graham Hansen in Germany as well, says. “Now, she is a more complete player, more of a team player. She is one of the best in the world and any midfielder in the world would love to play with her, because you know that in the moment that you give her the ball, something great can happen.” She’s also really found her voice off the pitch – standing up for what she feels is right – and her position as a recognisable figure and a role model, particularly back in Norway, continues to grow. “She has even moved Messi away from the Pepsi bottles,” Jansen laughs. “They’ve taken away Messi and put Caroline on there instead.” “It's giving me goosebumps actually because I would never have thought that could happen at all,” Gulbrandsen adds. “When you grow up and you only have male role models playing soccer and now she's at the front with Pepsi… That's kind of big!” Perhaps the only thing missing is individual recognition. Graham Hansen was easily one of the best players in the world last season but was not included on the Ballon d’Or shortlist. “Excuse me, but that’s a f*cking joke,” Masar says, justifiably. “I think you have to appreciate football and we're still in this world where it's starting to slowly change and Barca is starting to get on this platform. “What she does, her and Marta [Torrejon] on that right hand side, I think that's one of the best right sides if not in the game right now. And they've proved it now for three years straight.” For a player like Graham Hansen, though, an assist-machine whose focus is on delivering for the team rather than personal glory, while it might be frustrating at times, that won’t bother her too much – certainly not while she is winning title after title in such style. What the panellists for these awards are waiting for is unclear, but her team-mates know her worth – as do so many more and as should Lyon, going into this weekend’s final. “She's one of the best players in the world,” Barcelona defender Irene Paredes said this week. “We are lucky to have her in our team. She always makes the difference and I hope she will this Saturday, also.” You wouldn’t bet against it.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-place-pepsi-barcelona-caroline-graham-hansen-best/bltf8485db6c9c4568a,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5546,England boss Wiegman tests positive for Covid-19 & will miss Women’s Euro clash with Northern Ireland,"England head coach Sarina Wiegman will be absent from the dugout when the Lionesses face Northern Ireland in their third and final group stage outing at the 2022 Women’s Euro, with the Dutch tactician having tested positive for Covid-19. Six points have already been collected en route to the knockout stage, with progress to the last eight already safely secured. Momentum will be important to maintain when facing fellow Brits that are making their first appearance at a major continental finals, especially after breaking records in an 8-0 demolition of Norway last time out, but changes could be made on and off the field. A statement from the FA confirming the absence of a highly-rated boss reads: “England Head Coach Sarina Wiegman has tested positive for Covid and will undertake a period of recovery at the squad’s base camp. “Assistant coach Arjan Veurink will lead the team for tonight’s fixture against Northern Ireland. “Wiegman will remain in remote contact with the players and technical staff and will be monitored regularly with a view to returning to all elements of her role as soon as possible.” Wiegman has become the latest member of the England camp to test positive for Covid-19, with Arsenal defender Lotte Wubben-Moy only recently returning to training on the back of an enforced absence.

5576,FIFA 23: What new features will be on PlayStation and Xbox?,"FIFA 23 hits the shelves in September 2022 with a host of new features and graphics improvements.  The iconic EA Sports video game franchise gets fancy enhancements to its existing modes in order to lure gamers to grab a copy of the latest edition, which is the final one before the EA Sports FC rebrand.  So what are the upgrades that we can expect from FIFA 23? GOAL brings you everything you need to know. HyperMotion technology was introduced for the first time in FIFA 22, especially for next-gen consoles PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. In this edition, we get to see HyperMotion2, which is an upgrade over the previous version.  ""Advances to groundbreaking next-gen HyperMotion gameplay technology with twice as much real match data capture take FIFA 23 to over 6000 true-to-life football animations, delivering realism every time you step on the pitch in FIFA 23,"" stated EA Sports in a release.  This has helped to improve AI in attack and defence, thus augmenting realism and making matches feel more dynamic to the player. A new risk versus reward shooting mechanic, refreshed free kicks, penalties and corners, and more realistic physics have been incorporated too.  Check out the official FIFA 23 Gameplay 'Deep Dive' below. Chemistry is a key component of the FUT formula, as gamers have to fit the best players into a combination that would suit them. Until now this has been achieved primarily by fielding players of the same nationality or from the same leagues, but some tweaks are expected in FIFA 23.  Leaks online suggest that players from across the world could be clubbed together in FIFA 23 Ultimate Team, while positional changes are also expected to be reworked. There will be new FUT Moments to enjoy, while a fresh batch of FUT Icons and Heroes will be announced too. Women's representation in FIFA has got a major boost as the English Women’s Super League and France’s Division 1 have been added. The most followed teams such as Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City, PSG, and more will therefore be available to play with.  Since this is a World Cup year, both men's and women's World Cup will feature in FIFA 23. Gamers will be able to try their hands on a full-fledged World Cup even before the actual tournament kicks off on November 21 in Qatar.  EA has enhanced its matchday experience by including augmented reality broadcast replays, hyper-realistic pitch surfaces and improved stadium atmosphere.  EA Sports has finally answered the demands of FIFA players by making Cross-Play available and as a result uniting various gaming platforms.  In FIFA 23, crossplay will be available for players on the same platform generation. PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Stadia, and PC versions of FIFA 23 will be cross-play compatible with one another, and PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of FIFA 23 will be cross-play compatible with one another. Cross-play is initially enabled for all players when launching FIFA 23 for the first time, provided the platform level settings allow for it and it can be opted out of at any time Great news for Juventus fans as the club will return to FIFA 23 with its official name and stadium, having previously been in the game as Piemonte Calcio.  Moreover, a host of new stadiums are also expected to be added to the game, including the Spotify Camp Nou, Juve's Allianz Stadium and Nottingham Forest's City Ground. However, while the Bianconeri return to EA Sports, Inter and Napoli will be missed due to licensing issues.

5587,"‘When you’re sh*t, you’re always going to hark back to the good old days’ - Behind Arsenal’s retro merch boom","2022 marks the year of the UEFA Women's Euro and the FIFA Men’s World Cup. All this week, VICE and GOAL will be collaborating to publish insightful, interesting stories from the world of football and fan culture, introducing VICE fans to GOAL and GOAL fans to VICE.  It’s no secret that Arsenal fans can be a little overly emotional at times. I’m not just talking about the comical way we’re represented – or how we represent ourselves – on social media, YouTube fan channels and all the rest, although that does play a part. But as a club, fanbase, team and everything in between, we’ve often found ourselves being driven by exaggerated sentiment, rather than the ruthless, mechanical, ‘win-at-all-costs’ mentality of other modern super clubs. Arsene Wenger, our manager of 22 years, an amount of time that holds a sense of romanticism in itself, was probably the reason for this, at least with my generation of fellow Arsenal fans. Under Wenger, we seemed to be only capable of huge, heartwarming wins, and humiliating, heartbreaking defeats, with barely anything in the middle. This was all underpinned by Wenger, our beloved footballing Yoda, who intermittently spouted wizened philosophy in between injury updates on Jack Wilshere and Abou Diaby. Nowadays, most of that ‘soul’, if a multibillion-pound corporation with thousands of employees could ever really have a ‘soul’, has been lost. Some of that may have been down to Wenger leaving, some was down to our lack of top-level success, but a lot of it was really just our owners, Kroenke Sports & Entertainment, or KSE, being as corporate-focused and financially-driven as every other billionaire, and acting accordingly. So, it’s no surprise really that most of our fanbase, old and young, have a natural inclination towards teary-eyed nostalgia, especially when it comes to their thirst for vintage merch and retro kits. Fans of my generation, now in their 30s, grew up during Arsenal’s most successful period, winning titles nearly every year, going a whole season unbeaten, and regularly having a lot of the best players in the world play the best football in the world, week in, week out. Is it any wonder they want to wear a kit that reminds them more of that than getting routinely thrashed by Manchester City and Liverpool? “We’ve had great kits, great players and great times,” explains Andrew Allen, football journalist and regular of Arsenal fansite Arseblog. “That’s a heady mix for a fan to resist given football loves to drown itself in nostalgia. Arsenal’s comparative lack of success in recent years definitely feeds into things, as does the fact we’re all suckers for a slick marketing campaign.” “I also think a lot of the old merch was much more creative because you had the club sourcing it out to other independent companies like KICK, who were doing stuff like all the crazy bomber jackets for the club,” adds Ed Fenwick, one of the founders of Eighteen86, a vintage Arsenal merch reseller. “By the end of the 90’s the club was doing it all itself and it got way less fun and a bit stale and corporate – if you look through the merch catalogues you can see everything getting cleaner and less adventurous as it goes along.” Ed and Max, the two guys behind Eighteen86, who also produce an Arsenal fanzine called Poison Lasagna, join a growing number of vintage football merch resellers that have firmly established themselves in the ‘If I Ever Had Enough Spare Cash’ section of most football fans' minds since around 2015. Just the other day I was absentmindedly browsing for old Arsenal shirts online when I came across this, a rare prototype ‘lightning’ away shirt from the 1995-96 season. It is exactly the same as the normal away shirt from that season, except its lightning is yellow instead of light blue. Also it costs £1,000 ($1,240). Personally, the idea of shelling out a grand for an old shirt, even if it is really rare, just seems absolutely ridiculous, but it wouldn’t be going for that much unless people are willing to pay for it. Then again, people are willing to pay thousands of pounds for a cartoon monkey jpeg, so I’m not sure ‘Things People Are Willing To Spend Money On’ is a good arbiter of sound rationale. “Eight years ago, I spotted an original Adidas 88-89 away shirt online for the bargain price of £70 ($87),” Andrew tells me. “When it arrived, the label was my size but I swear it must have been put through the wash a million times because it fit like a crop top! I was genuinely gutted and sent it back. “In hindsight, I should have kept it because their value continues to rise. I still keep my eyes peeled for bargains, but these days the market is heaving with kit connoisseurs, experts and resellers, so they are hard to come by.” Personally, my two most expensive Arsenal pieces were an old training top from the 2002-03 season, and an original ‘bruised banana’ away shirt from ‘93, both purchased at a time when I had just been paid and momentarily forgot how money and time worked in constant friction of each other, i.e. was not of sound rationale. So, with the price of vintage merch as it is, you’d think getting into the reselling business would be expensive, but as is the case with most retro clothes shops, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure. “Last year, our mate Josh who runs another vintage reseller store called ‘AStoreLike94’ messaged us and said he thought he had some stuff that might interest us,” says Ed. “It was a proper motherlode that he'd come across through someone at a pub mentioning to his brother that they were getting rid of their Arsenal stuff. “Before that, we'd both been collecting for years without really realising it: picking things up on eBay and at charity shops,” Ed continues. “We never wore any of it, so we got it all in a pile and realised there was a lot of it. Although a lot of places sell the shirts, nowhere sold the stuff that we'd always been obsessed with: the old bootleg stuff and the casual wear the club used to make.” These days, our current kit manufacturers, Adidas, are doing so many retro kit re-releases that we’ve been dubbed ‘a retro sportswear brand that sometimes plays football’. It’s easy to think that football, like most other totemic, emotive things in modern life: food, politics, film and music, is just cheaply repackaging nostalgia and selling it back to us at an inflated price because everyone’s either run out of ideas or the people in positions of power are cynical, money-grabbing so-and-sos. And that may all be true. But I’ll tell you what else is true: Arsenal’s latest retro shirt was great. I got it in a long sleeve. “When you’re sh*t, you’re always going to hark back to the good old days, it’s a natural defence mechanism in this era of perpetual ‘fan banter’,” Andrew explains. “Arsenal have at various points in our history been one of the best football clubs in the world – and now we’re not. Nostalgia seems a decent place to take refuge.” “I don't think anyone wants to be stuck in the past but I do reckon nostalgia can help us understand what we have and want from now – I guess it kind of helps keep the past alive and connects it to the present,” adds Ed. DID YOU KNOW: Retro sportswear brand ‘Arsenal’ has its own football club, which actually beat professional side Sheffield United in October 2020 pic.twitter.com/yGGEJWK0As “Most of it is just Adidas and Arsenal knowing the retro stuff is a gold mine, but it upsets me that they're wise to everyone loving the old crest and let Adidas reproduce it in monthly retro drops rather than just changing the crest back, which is what everyone actually wants.” In a way, there are a lot of parallels with Sky Sports and the creation of the Premier League itself and the current state of the Arsenal fanbase. Like some kind of genetically modified, football-obsessed cows, the modern football fan is constantly pumped with as much ephemeral, world-ending emotion as it can handle, every week: the Super Sundays, the Monday Night Footballs, the Soccer Saturdays. Does it make me a rational, level-headed fan? Not really. Does it make me incredibly susceptible to multimillion-pound marketing campaigns from global corporations featuring classic-players-in-videos-with-soaring-violins? Yeah, kind of. Nostalgia is football’s one trump card, that no matter how bad things currently are, can be wielded like an excalibur to easily waft away the present and its overwhelming, complicated thoughts. Anyway, that’s the reason I bought the latest retro Arsenal shirt.

5644,The pride of England! Lionesses sweep Sweden aside in watershed moment for women's football,"""Is this England team ready to go out there and make history?’ was the question put to head coach Sarina Wiegman on the eve of the Lionesses’ Women’s Euro semi-final with Sweden. “The England team is ready to play their best game against Sweden,” she responded, before – tongue-in-cheek – deciding her answer wasn’t finished. “And hopefully,” she added, “we inspire the nation.” It was said with a smile, a giggle at herself almost. England is often cited as one of the nations most advanced in the women’s game, with its professional league, landmark broadcast deal and top investment from top clubs. But press conferences will still be flooded with question after question about inspiring a nation and the next generation. Even ahead of the Lionesses' fourth successive major tournament semi-final, you will see the main talking points in some papers being about how the women’s game is great because they don’t dive like their male counterparts. However, on Tuesday night, England sealed their place in the 2022 UEFA Women’s Euro final with a scintillating 4-0 win over Sweden.  It’s the women’s team’s first major tournament final since Euro 2009 and it felt like the watershed moment the country needs to put the pandering to bed, to stop patronising and talking about anything but the quality of the football produced. WEMBLEY AWAITS 🤩WE'LL SEE YOU ON SUNDAY FOR THE #WEURO2022 FINAL! pic.twitter.com/InKRZKBABt After all, what Wiegman’s side have done at this tournament has been sensational.  After a shaky start to the tournament in a nervy opening win over Austria, they took on a fancied Norway – a team with Ballon d’Or winner Ada Hegerberg and Caroline Graham Hansen, Barcelona’s electric winger, in their squad. They tore them apart in an 8-0 demolition, capitalising on every error, every bit of space, and converting chance after chance after chance. They were ruthless. The records tumbled and tumbled as the net continued to ripple in Brighton. Victory over Northern Ireland, by five goals to nil, followed, before a quarter-final with Spain in which they came through in extra time. That one required grit, character and real dogged mentality. The win over Sweden combined everything. The Scandinavians started better, they pressed well, they got in behind, they created chances. But England rode it out and their response was emphatic. Beth Mead’s superb touch, turn and finish kicked things off. Suddenly, the Lionesses hit their stride. Lucy Bronze scored a header. Then, Alessia Russo did something that it’d be impossible to patronise. Having seen her initial shot saved by Hedvig Lindahl, she picked up the rebound on the right hand side of the box, with her back to goal. If you blinked, you missed it, as she arrowed a backheel flick through the legs of the goalkeeper. No matter what goals follow in the two games that remain in this tournament, that will be the pick of them all. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Take a bow @alessiarusso7 😱👏#WEURO2022 | #ENG | #SWE pic.twitter.com/pwhRv7Ubnk When Fran Kirby lifted the ball over Lindahl from range a few minutes later, it made it 20 goals in five games, with one conceded. Sweden are not a poor team, either. They were the team many tipped to win this tournament. They were the silver medal winners at the Olympics last summer – losing only on penalties after being outstanding in Japan. Three years ago, they beat England to third place in the World Cup. While the defending for some of the goals in Sheffield on Tuesday night could’ve been better, they didn’t perform particularly badly either. Yet, England would deal them their first defeat in 90 minutes of football since March 2020 on their way to a major tournament final. After three successive semi-final defeats, this was them over the line. Millie Bright, the England centre-back, said those memories had been “parked to one side”. You could tell. They looked calm, even when they were under pressure. They looked ready to take this step. On Sunday, they will face either Germany or France for what would be this team’s first ever major title. It’ll be at Wembley Stadium, the country’s iconic ground. And, as the chants of ‘It’s coming home’ around Bramall Lane showed, this nation believes it will be an evening of celebration, not yet more heartbreak to add to an ever-growing list harboured by every England football fan. ‘We’re going to win it, aren’t we?’ said a waitress in a restaurant near the ground in Sheffield where England would make history. There’s no need to pander to the masses anymore. An entire nation has already embraced this team, and this sport.  Wiegman's Lionesses are the pride of England right now.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-semi-final-rout-sweden-watershed-moment-women/blta06b5fa6c95cf570,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5680,Barcelona respond to accusation of ‘abusive behaviour’ from Brazil forward Gio,"Barcelona have responded to accusations made by forward Giovana Queiroz about ‘abusive behaviour’, claiming that both the club and FIFA found they had “acted properly” in the situation. Gio joined Barca in the summer of 2020 and is one of the most highly-rated young prospects in women’s football, ranking at No.10 in this year’s women’s NXGN list. The 18-year-old is yet to make a competitive appearance for Barca but was included in a number of the club’s matchday squads before leaving to join Levante on loan, where she has scored five league goals this season. She has won 11 caps for her country, including one at last summer's Olympic Games. On Tuesday, Gio sent a post from her Twitter account which read: “Open letter to the President of FC Barcelona.” In a series of tweets afterwards, she detailed her experiences at the club, writing: “It has not been easy to get to this point. There were many months of anguish and suffering. Despite everything I've been through, today I feel capable of denouncing the abusive behaviour I suffered within FC Barcelona's women's football.” Gio stated that she was “very well received by the players and the coaching staff” upon her arrival and “in a good dynamic, until I received the first call from the Brazilian national team”. The forward was eligible to play for Spain and the United States, as well as Brazil. She then alleged that she was “subjected to illegal confinement by the head of the club’s medical services”. “She claimed that she would be a close contact of a positive COVID case. From the beginning I sensed that the real reasons for the confinement were others. As the doctor's order was contrary to health protocol, I contacted the Catalan Health Department directly and asked for clarification. “The answer was clear and forceful. My case was not and could not be considered a close contact according to the current health protocol. When questioned, she replied: ""Your case is different. I was authorised to make a special confinement for you."" I, indignant, still asked: How special? She avoided the subject and never answered me!” pic.twitter.com/TnBxsueZOi Gio continued: “After completing the quarantine imposed, I received authorisation from FIFA to join the Brazilian National Team in the United States, with the full knowledge of the club. Before traveling and during the concentration period, I carried out several PCR tests, always with negative results. “When I returned to Barcelona, they called a meeting with the club director. At that meeting, I was accused of having committed serious indiscipline and that, therefore, I would be removed from the team and suffer serious consequences. “I was completely shocked. They unfairly accused me of having breached the confinement, of having travelled without authorization from the club and without the consent of the team captains.” The forward added: “FC Barcelona is not directly responsible for the reported abusive conduct. The club must be responsible for ensuring physical, mental, psychological and moral integrity against any form of violence, establishing comprehensive protection through awareness, prevention, protection and repair of the damage caused. “My personal and professional life was deeply affected by these deeply demeaning and negative experiences. The memories, the trauma, and its effects are likely to last for many years. I lived through many months of anguish and sadness, something unimaginable when I arrived at the club. “Today I want to take the first step to fully recover my freedom and emotional stability and that is why I decided to write this open letter. I hope that FC Barcelona fulfils its institutional role and acts consistently and transparently, investigating and reporting possible crimes to the relevant authorities. “I also hope that the club, through its president, commits to implementing effective measures to combat the evident and well-documented problem of moral abuse, workplace harassment and psychological violence against women. Finally, I want to express my deep gratitude to all the people who have helped and supported me in the most difficult moments of my life.” When asked about Gio’s statement, Barcelona responded: “Government rules did not permit the travel with Brazil. A process was opened to look at how the club handled the situation and both the club and FIFA found that FC Barcelona acted properly. ""The allegations of moral abuse, workplace harassment and psychological violence are not true. Giovana was a close contact of a positive Covid-19 case and the club told her she couldn’t travel to Orlando in the United States with the Brazilian national team due to Spanish government regulations. ""The player complained to the club's compliance department and to FIFA. FC Barcelona's compliance department and FIFA found that they had both acted properly. The case was closed.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-respond-accusation-abusive-behaviour-brazil-gio/blt5a5a59454a8c4f7d,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5703,"'Spain, England or Germany will probably win the Euros' - Canada head coach Bev Priestman","Canada head coach Bev Priestman believes her team have “played a team that’s probably going to go on and win the Euros” in this month’s Arnold Clark Cup. The Olympic gold medallists ended their campaign in the inaugural tournament with a 1-0 defeat to Spain on Wednesday afternoon after a goal from Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas. They had drawn with England and beaten Germany 1-0 before that. After the final match, Priestman talked up Spain’s chances of going on to triumph at the UEFA Women’s Euro this summer, as well as England’s and Germany’s. Speaking in her post-match press conference, the Canada coach said: “I thought in the second half, in reality, we had Spain camped in their half. I think that's a big ask. They are a top, top team. “You talk about this tournament having teams for the Euros - we played a team that's probably going to go and win the Euros in one of the three teams we've played. “I think Spain are more than [their FIFA ranking of] ninth [in the world] in terms of where they're at. In Europe, they're being talked about as the favourites to win the Euros and I definitely felt that in the first half. It definitely felt like a team that is very difficult. “We've been known for our defensive prowess and, granted, there were some changes that impacted that. I made those purposefully in terms of experiences, first cap, change of the goalkeeper, etc. For me, I felt the first half was a fair reflection of that Spain team. They came as advertised.” Alexia Putellas doing what Alexia Putellas does 🤩#ArnoldClarkCup pic.twitter.com/dvzNlkfCOz Canada might have come into this tournament having won the Olympic gold medal in the summer, but Priestman accepted before the Arnold Clark Cup kicked off that she wouldn’t see any “perfect” performances, with lots of her team still in pre-season. The team do leave having learned a lot though, especially with players needing to step up with the likes of Christine Sinclair, the greatest international goal-scorer of all time, missing. “I think we've taken a step forward,” Priestman said, reflecting on the tournament as a whole. “I feel like we found ways to get Ashley Lawrence higher. We've got more combinations and more trust in players. I think we've widened the depth. I've tested more players. I said coming into this, we come away with European experience. We've done that. “I'm so glad we attended this tournament. I think we've got massive learnings and there's some players that have really had to step up. I must say, for some of those players that haven't kicked a ball since [games against] Mexico [in November], some of them have just gone and played three games and that's what this team is about. “They love putting the shirt on. They'll give everything. They're braver than they've ever been. That's what I feel. I feel like we're ready to go after teams. It just didn't happen today.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/spain-england-or-germany-will-probably-win-the-euros-canada-head-/blt8105d1b060c315e1,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

5759,'Nowhere near enough to win big games' - Youthful USWNT struggles in SheBelieves Cup opener,"It was perhaps unsurprising that the U.S. women’s national team did not set the world alight in their SheBelieves Cup opener against the Czech Republic on Thursday night. With the exception of Lyon’s Catarina Macario, the entire group was in preseason. With an average age of 25.55 years, it was also the youngest starting XI the USWNT had fielded in nearly four years as the team embarks on a period of transition. All that said, this was a game the USWNT would have expected to win and with the number of chances they had, they certainly could have. But instead, a resolute Czech side backstopped by in-form goalkeeper Barbora Votikova thwarted the U.S. in a 0-0 draw at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California. “You look at the players that were on the field, how many times they've been on the field together, [chemistry] is something that will come with minutes and games together,” head coach Vlatko Andonovski said in his post-game press conference. “It’s not easy. It doesn't matter how good they are or how much potential they have. It's not easy to just throw them on the field and expect them to click immediately.” Much was made in the build-up to the SheBelieves Cup about the names that weren’t on the U.S. roster, including veteran stars Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, Christen Press, and Tobin Heath. Andonovski gave starts to three players expected to help carry the load whenever the aforementioned quartet leaves the international stage: Macario, Sophia Smith and Mallory Pugh. But it was a mixed bag for that trio. That’s a wrap on Match Day No. 1.#SheBelievesCup x @Visa pic.twitter.com/Gj0oldoLxu Macario, who leading up to the match admitted “I need to start making things happen” as she passed her year anniversary with the USWNT, started as a withdrawn striker. The 22-year-old did indeed make some things happen, especially when dropping deep and linking play. But like her teammates, Macario lacked some sharpness when presented with chances to score or assist. “I think we’re going to see more of Cat in that position going forward so she can get used to it and she also needs to get used to the players around her,” Andonovski said. “This is the first time she’s done that and there were lots of players around her that haven’t played together."" Smith showed some examples of her immense skill while Pugh was mostly quiet on the night. Both players were withdrawn with 30 minutes to play in a double substitution that saw one of the more highly anticipated USWNT debuts in recent years: Washington Spirit star Trinity Rodman. Rodman is undoubtedly destined for great things and showed flashes, but she and Spirit teammate Ashley Sanchez, also introduced in the second half, didn’t quite have the impact on the game that fans of their NWSL team are used to seeing so routinely. just the beginning ☝️#SheBelievesCup x @Visa pic.twitter.com/46dHgEqGdP Instead, it was some of the USWNT’s more experienced players who impressed the most. Rose Lavelle was consistently dangerous while driving forward from midfield, while Kristie Mewis brought a much-needed injection of attacking impetus after coming on at halftime for the more defensive-minded Morgan Gautrat. In the end, Andonovski won’t be too concerned with the result. The Czechs are a well-drilled side who appear to be improving fast. His youthful USWNT side will have better nights as they continue to jell and round into regular season form with their clubs. But on a night where some of the young U.S. stars could have stamped their authority on the team, they failed to do so. A full-fledged changing of the guard was never likely to be an easy process, and Andonovski ended his press conference with a stark assessment of his squad. “We all know how we look and where we are at is nowhere near enough to win big games,"" the coach concluded.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/youthful-uswnt-struggles-shebelieves-cup-opener/blt545925f1b6a523ee,By Seth Vertelney,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5774,'Was it meant to be?' - Inside Liverpool's return to the Women's Super League,"It was the day before Liverpool’s Champions League quarter-final against Benfica and Jurgen Klopp’s press conference was about to close. The final question of the day, though, prompted the German coach to show off one of his famous fist pumps: Liverpool’s women’s team had just won the Championship title, sealing a return to the Women’s Super League after relegation in 2020. ""I was following it all the time around our games, looking when they played, who they played,” he said. “I'm really happy for the girls. It's a big thing. “Liverpool in the last years was not famous for dealing with the women’s football [team] outstandingly well, they didn’t go down for no reason, but now they are back and we have to make sure we use the situation."" Lots has been said about Liverpool in the past few years and how it treats the women’s team, and Klopp did not shy away from that. His answer was genuine and recognised past mistakes. It was another positive sign as this team prepares for its return to the top-flight. Liverpool have been promoted to the Women's Super League after winning the Women's Championship 🙌 pic.twitter.com/M80xJk5F4W On Sunday, after beating Sheffield United 6-1, the players finally got their hands on that Championship trophy, lifting it in front of their own fans. And when GOAL speaks to those involved in the achievement, there is an aura of optimism, but also the one word that goalkeeper Rachael Laws uses to describe the feeling the most - “relief”. Head coach Matt Beard, who won back-to-back WSL titles with this club in 2013 and 2014 before returning last summer, veers in that direction, too. “Mentally, it was draining, when you're so close to securing it,” he says. After an unstoppable run of 19 games unbeaten, it became a matter of when rather than if the Reds would reign supreme. Some will take the cynical view on their success, in that if a club of Liverpool’s stature is in the second tier, they should be winning it. But it has been more difficult than some may think. “The lows were low last season,” Laws explains, reflecting on a campaign that saw the Reds finish third, 11 points behind champions Leicester City. “We went through a lot as a team, on and off the pitch. “I think coming off the back of [that], we did want to prove people wrong, and the mental side of the game was massive for us to do that.” This is not an easy league, either. Beard has tons of experience at the highest level, in England and the United States, but he describes the Championship as “a fantastic learning curve” that has “really tested” him and his staff. So, how did he lead Liverpool back to the top-flight? “He creates this culture where everyone feels comfortable to be themselves and you feel like he genuinely cares about you, on and off the field,” forward Katie Stengel explains. “You have more confidence on the field and you feel like, in the locker room, everyone supports each other because he demands that. “That type of environment breeds a lot of confidence, but it breeds a lot of team camaraderie as well where you want the best out of each other.” “Stability is probably the main word that sticks out just because he's consistent in everything he does,” Laws adds. “Whether we will win, lose or draw, we'll sit in the meeting room and we'll go through stuff. Sometimes you don't want to hear it, but sometimes you need to. I think that little bit of honesty does go a long way.” As well as Beard bringing good staff in with him, he has recruited well - signing Stengel, in January, for example, the forward scoring eight goals in 11 league games since. The coach has also got the best out of players already at the club, such as Missy Bo Kearns, one of Liverpool’s brightest stars this season. Another factor has been the way the team has dealt with inevitable pressure. “We couldn't just turn up and say, 'Hey, we're Liverpool, we're going to win',” Stengel says. “We knew we had to turn up every week. Every week we had that pressure to get three points. “We dealt with a lot of different adversities, but I think together we came together and knew: 'We're going to deal with this pressure, but we're going to breathe and just get through it together and make each other look good'.” It must be said that the fans have played their part as well, with Laws recalling several away games that felt like home matches, such has been the level of support. At which point did the team really feel they could do this, then? Beard, Laws and Stengel all single out one particular match: Charlton away, won in the 84th minute by a Jaz Matthews header. “You just felt a shift in energy, because we were nervous the whole time,” Stengel remembers. “We knew we needed points here and when that went in so late, we were like, 'Okay. It actually is going to go our way. We can do it'.” That result came in the month of March, in which Liverpool had four very tough fixtures. For that reason, Beard highlights his team's fantastic unbeaten run in the league through January and February, too. For Laws, there is also another game that sticks out – a 1-0 win at home to Watford, when Stengel scored her first Liverpool goal in the 83rd minute. “My first thought after that game was, 'We would've drawn or lost that last season',” she says. “That was the moment where you think, 'God, our luck might be in here'. “There was a reason why you came to the club and scored that goal,” she says, turning to Stengel. It is no surprise the goalkeeper believes in little twists of fate. Nine years ago, she was part of Beard’s Liverpool team that lifted a league title. “Was it meant to be?” she asks, reflecting on a similar turn of events this year. “Maybe.” Next season, she will be back in the top-flight with the same club and manager as the Reds try to re-establish themselves among the country’s best. The benefits that Beard’s experience and knowledge of the league will bring are evident when he looks forward, discussing the importance of limited player turnover this summer, for example. “It's probably going to be two or three transfer windows before we can say, 'Yes, let's start competing at that top end',” he says. “I believe that we can compete against anyone in the country, for sure, but we have to be realistic and know the jump from the Championship to the Super League is going to be a big jump.” The support from within the club can certainly help in shaping this squad to fulfil the ambition Beard shows. “You always get those keyboard warriors, don't you?” Laws says. “'The men don't support you' and all this. But they do. We can assure you that they do, and it goes a long way. “I think going forward, you'll probably see a little bit more of what's going on behind the scenes at the minute.” There’s still one game remaining in Liverpool’s season, as they close their Championship campaign on the south coast against Lewes on Sunday. Then, the players can really enjoy this success and, shortly afterwards, start looking ahead to 2022-23. Given the standards Liverpool are setting on the men’s side, it is exciting to think of the potential of its women’s team as they return to the top.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/meant-to-be-inside-liverpool-women-super-league-return/blte4cee0390fac286e,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

The nation had never before lifted the title at senior level, in the men's or women's game, but they prevailed in front of a huge capacity crowd to cap a memorable summer for Sarina Wiegman's charges. The Lionesses won all six of their matches at the tournament to run out worthy champions on home soil. Wiegman's team had advanced from Group A with three wins and nine points and subsequently dispatched Spain and Sweden in the knockout stages to reach the final. Germany in turn had also progressed through the competition with a perfect record of five wins, setting up an enthralling fixture at Wembley. It was England who drew first blood, scoring via Ella Toone just after the hour.  But just when they thought the title was closing, Lina Magull struck to equalise with just 11 minutes left to play to send the game to extra-time, where Kelly proved the difference as she turned home from short range to finally seal victory.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/watch-toone-sends-england-into-lead-in-euro-2022-final-with/blt27f8c0f15ad16039,Daniel Edwards,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5866,"'The day I debuted I felt relief' - Trans footballer Mara Gomez on discrimination, violence and how football saved her life","Trans footballer Mara Gomez has opened up on the ""relief"" she felt when she made her debut in the women's game, with the Estudiantes player reflecting on a career that has seen her battle discrimination and threats of violence to stand where she is. Gomez became the first transgender player in the Argentina's women's championship in December 2020, making her debut for Villa San Carlos. Now, she has spoken out on the rush of emotions she faced after finally realising her professional dream in her first game against Lanus over a year-and-a-half ago in an interview with GOAL Argentina, reflecting on the journey she had to make to become who she is. ""The day I debuted I felt a relief, I felt that a weight had been lifted off my shoulders and that I had achieved something that I didn't think I would be able to achieve,"" Gomez stated. ""Something that seemed impossible to me. ""It is very difficult to be able to think of a trans girl within what soccer is, a sport that was always considered that only men could practice it and since those of us who did not belong to that gender or that sex had to pay costs to be able to be and belong. ""Being a trans girl in this environment was very difficult to get to. It meant years of struggle for the entire group and is the beginning of new opportunities for a lot of generations. I always say it, football saved my life, football was a contention, it was and is everything. ""Beyond the competition, it is something that you love to do and that is part of your life. I think this opens up opportunities for a lot of generations of our group that have always been violated, violated, discriminated against and excluded. ""For me, transphobia has to do with breaking paradigms and perspectives and beginning to see within society with a more unstructured vision, that we stop thinking that there are only two genders or two sexes and that you have to comply with a behavior or a rule in order to be 'normal'."" Elsewhere, Gomez spoke out on the threats and struggles faced by the trans community, adding that violence is institutionalized towards them - and that her decision to pursue her career does not change the targets she has on her back. ""It is what we live as people who belong to the LGBT community,"" she added. ""[We're] constantly paying costs to give us the opportunity to live a decent life; the opportunity to study, work, have a family, play sports. ""Violence is everywhere in our environment but mainly in institutions, such as the cost that I have to pay for my body to be able to play soccer. Violence is just that, the lack of opportunity and the equity that is lacking in any social sphere.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/trans-footballer-mara-gomez-how-football-saved-her-life/blt4e1961d8fde6aa69,Goal Argentina,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5890,Chelsea boss Hayes details 'major' impact of COVID as Blues suffer shock UWCL group stage exit,"Chelsea manager Emma Hayes believes the worry about the COVID-19 outbreak in England ""played a major part"" as the Blues crashed out in the Women's Champions League group stages on Thursday night. Hayes' side reached the final of the competition last season and were top of their group heading into the final round of games, with Wolfsburg needing to beat them by two clear goals to qualify instead. The German side ran out 4-0 winners in the end and after the game, the Chelsea boss went into detail about the impact the recent surge in COVID cases has had on her team, with two players ruled out for this game due to positive tests. Speaking in her post-match press conference, Hayes said: ""First of all, congratulations to Wolfsburg. They deserved to go through. I think it's important for me to say. ""I'm not making excuses for the players, but I can tell you that the last three days have been all over the place with the worry that we have to play this game. While fixture congestion is a thing, COVID is real and when you're in a team environment, you know that it spreads like wildfire in a team. ""I'm gutted. I'm gutted for the players, because we all know that was nowhere near a team that represents my team. I've got players being sick in there, they've got diarrhoea, they're exhausted, and maybe some of that mental anxiety plays a part in it. ""But I just feel like this was deja vu and we're here again 12 months on after a really, really bad COVID outbreak at exactly the same time last year. I think that played a major part in our performance tonight."" Asked if she feels there should be a pause in the season, Hayes replied: ""I'm definitely not on the fence. We do not get paid millions of pounds. I want my players to go and see their families. ""Unfortunately, we couldn't separate that anxiety from the performance. I didn't recognise my players tonight. I thought we were all over the place. If we land tomorrow, take our PCR test and we have a mass outbreak with COVID then, what do you want me to say? ""We've gone out in the Champions League and I know we're absolutely gutted about it, but I can honestly tell you I don't recognise my team tonight. I've never seen performance like that from them and stress and anxiety is real. ""While I wish they could have separated it to perform, we were nowhere near it to be in a position to win."" Chelsea knew that a draw would be enough to send them through, but were tasked with travelling to face a Wolfsburg side who needed to win. Svenja Huth put the hosts 2-0 up inside 25 minutes, with the Blues' defence - which had conceded only two goals in the last 11 games - all at sea. An injury to captain Magdalena Eriksson was another blow to the team and its defence, with Tabea Wassmuth able to add two second half goals to seal the victory.

We were in a 4-2-3-1, but we weren't here,"" Hayes said, waving her hand in front of her face. ""It didn't matter how much information we were trying to give, we were all over the place. We don't talk about a lot of this from performance perspectives, but whatever battles internally were going on individually... Have you ever seen so many individuals in this team perform so poorly? Not really, not often. ""They're really, really difficult moments as a coach when you have so many players performing so poorly, and they're so disjointed and all over the place."" Along with Wolfsburg, Juventus sealed their qualification from Group A, beating Servette after a goalless draw with Chelsea in London last week.

5908,All of US: The U.S. Women's Soccer Show: NWSL 2022 season & USWNT schedule preview,"After an eventful off-season, the NWSL is finally back this weekend, as the Challenge Cup kicks off on Friday night. It is the first in a flurry of events for women's soccer fans in the United States to look forward to, with the U.S. women's national team back in action next month, before the full NWSL season begins. On this week's episode of All of US: The U.S. Women's Soccer Show, GOAL looks ahead to all that is coming, picking out the players, teams and stories to keep an eye on as 2022 unfolds. You can find All of US simply by searching for it on your preferred podcast platform, be that Spotify, Apple, or something else. As well as the latest episode, listeners can go back and catch plenty of top preview content for the year ahead from previous weeks. One of two expansion sides for 2022, the San Diego Wave plays its first competitive game this weekend and Naomi Girma came on the show last week to give an insight into how Casey Stoney's team are preparing. The Portland Thorns are the defending champions in the Challenge Cup and defender Kelli Hubly recently joined GOAL ahead of her side's title defence, while Meghann Burke, executive director of the NWSL Players' Association, kicked off the current season of the podcast when she discussed the league's first ever collective bargaining agreement, which was announced in February. The 2021 NWSL season was marred by numerous allegations of abusive coaches, with many investigations into such developments still to be concluded and findings to be revealed. One of the many teams to change its coach as a result of that was the Washington Spirit, which has also been dealing with a chaotic ownership situation too. However, the Spirit, led by Rookie of the Year Trinity Rodman, defied all the odds and overcame all the obstacles in its season to win its first ever NWSL Championship in November. The question now is, can this team do it again? GOAL discusses exactly that, breaks down the favourites for the title on this week's show and also highlights the players you should be keeping an eye on this year - from exciting international talents, established USWNT stars and top picks in the NWSL Draft. 🚨 NEW EPISODE: All of US 🚨@naomi_girma on:￭ Signing for @sandiegowavefc ✍️￭ Being the first NWSL draft pick 🇺🇸￭ Working under @caseystoney 🙌￭ Training against Alex Morgan 🤩￭ Her Ethiopian roots 🇪🇹LISTEN NOW 👇 After winning the SheBelieves Cup again last month, the USWNT is back in action in April when it takes on a lowly-ranked Uzbekistan side in a double-header.

Andonovski has left names like Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe off his rosters in recent months in favour of younger talents, but as the NWSL kicks off, if those players are in top form, what does he do then? With a Concacaf Women's Championship coming this summer, it will be interesting to see who is chosen for that April camp and in June as well, particularly with the 2023 Women's World Cup not far away now.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/all-of-us-us-womens-soccer-2022-nwsl-uswnt-schedule/blt45a66d4935fba65d,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5933,Spain star Putellas suffers ACL injury days before Women's Euro 2022,"Spain star Alexia Putellas is set to miss the 2022 Women's European Championship after tearing her ACL in the days leading up to the tournament. Putellas was expected to lead her country into the competition as one of the best players in the world, with Spain recognised among the favourites this summer. But the loss of Putellas will be a massive blow to Spain's hopes as the Barcelona star is set to be out for an extended period of time. ""The tests carried out on the Spanish international on the afternoon of this Tuesday, July 5, 2022, at King Edward VII's hospital in London, have confirmed that the captain of the Spanish Women's National Team suffers a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee,"" the Spanish FA said in a statement. The injury occurred in a pre-tournament training session, with Spain's worst fears realised as she was diagnosed with a catastrophic injury. GOAL's women's football correspondent Amee Ruszkai writes... Putellas’ importance to this Spain team cannot be overstated.  The best player in the world is not only important because of her skills on the pitch, but her leadership too. Her absence will be an absolutely huge setback for a nation so many are excited to watch this summer. Spain have landed themselves in the ‘group of death’ at the Euros, pooled with eight-time winners Germany and the 2017 runners-up, Denmark.  Putellas’ match-winning qualities and ability to make a difference would’ve been such a boost to their cause to progress to the quarter-finals.  Jorge Vilda is fortunate in that he is blessed with a very deep and talented pool of players, with Aitana Bonmati someone who can certainly step up and deliver big moments like her Barca team-mate - something she has a fantastic record of doing in huge games.  There is great leadership throughout the team, too, and tons of players who have winning experience and world-class quality like Putellas.  But the 2021 Ballon d’Or winner is almost irreplaceable and there is no doubt Spain will miss her in England.  Moreover, the news is just devastating for a player enjoying the best time of her career and ready to show that on a huge international stage for the first time since her rise to superstardom.  For a tournament like this to be missing one of the game’s best players feels, quite simply, sad. The 28-year-old playmaker has played for Barcelona since 2012 and has won five league titles and a Champions League title.  During the 2020-21 season, she played a key role in Barca's continental treble, going on to win UEFA Women's Player of the Year, the Ballon d'Or and the Best FIFA Women's Player award, becoming the first player to win all three in the same year.  Internationally, she's featured 100 times for Spain, having earned her first cap in 2012.  She's featured in three major international competitions, but it was this summer's Euros that were supposed to be her chance to shine as one of the top players in the world.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/spain-star-putellas-acl-injury-euro-2022/blta77a711c14cfd7c3,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5947,England score record eight goals in historic Women's Euro win over Norway,"England continued their excellent start to the 2022 Women's European Championship with a historic 8-0 win against Norway on Monday. The Lionesses fired in six goals in a dazzling first-half performance in the Group A clash before adding two more after the break. Beth Mead netted a hat-trick to lead the way, while Ellen White scored twice in the record-breaking effort. Sarina Wiegman's team beat Austria 1-0 in their opening game of the tournament and have continued their strong play with a second straight win. Wiegman's side became the first team to score six goals in the first half of a European Championship. They have broken the record that was set the previous day by France, who went in 5-0 up against Italy at the break on Sunday. The Lionesses also set a record with their eight total goals; the previous record for the men's or women's Euros was six. 6 - In one half, England have equalled the most goals ever scored by a team in a full game in UEFA Women's Euros history (Germany 6-2 v England in 2009 and England 6-0 v Scotland in 2017). Floodgates. pic.twitter.com/R2L5xCEcnn The only other women's teams to have scored six in a Euros clash were England when they beat Scotland 6-0 in 2017 and Germany, who beat the Lionesses 6-2 in 2009. ""I can’t put it into words,"" Mead said to BBC One. ""I’m just loving being here, loving being part of this team and loving every minute. ""It’s an incredible feeling to feel how I do right now. I don’t think I even dreamt of this. I’m just so happy I got the goals to help the team. ""I haven’t even thought about it [the Golden Boot]. I just want to get the goals to help us win. ""The girls need to enjoy this one. These are the moments we need to enjoy."" Meanwhile, Wiegman added: ""'What’s going on here?' That was going through my mind. Norway didn’t have the answers. We created chances, scored goals and it was very enjoyable to watch. ""Games can go really strange. We’ve seen so many games when it’s 3-0 and goes to 3-3, but when it went to 4-0 and 5-0 I thought they’re not going to recover from this. ""Norway didn’t have the best game today. We’re really happy with the performance. We showed how good we are. When we go through [from the group stage] we’ll get tested at a higher level. We need to do better every game. ""We really showed our qualities. The fans have been really nice again, almost 30,000 of them. We just need to enjoy that moment, relax a little bit then start preparing for the next game."" Mead's hat-track and her assist for Hemp's goal in the first half against Norway enhanced her status as the most prolific player in the squad since Wiegman took charge. She has now been involved in 27 goals in total. Hemp is not far behind, having also chipped in with a goal and an assist for Mead against Norway, meaning she has now scored eight times and set up 11 under the Dutch coach.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-score-six-first-half-goals-against-norway-in/blt07f05916a4cffc60,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Man City confirmed in an official statement that Bardsley would be honoured before their Women's Super League (WSL) home game against Birmingham City on Wednesday.

""As sad and strange as it is to be stepping away from something I've committed my entire young adult life to, ultimately it's something I feel really proud of and I can honestly say, hand on heart, I've left no stone unturned and I have no regrets about how I've applied myself and what I've achieved. ""I feel incredibly proud of my career, but ultimately I'm really excited about the next steps and what is to come in the future, and I'm just very much looking forward to giving back to the football community in many other ways."" Bardsley earned 82 caps for the Lionesses and was also first choice goalkeeper for Great Britain at the London 2012 Olympic Games. She made her senior England debut in the Algarve Cup in March 2005, before going on to represent her country at seven major tournaments. At club level, she joined Man City in 2013 and won a WSL title, three FA Cups and four League Cups.

6019,Barcelona vs Real Madrid: Women's head-to-head record & who has the most trophies?,"The rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid is one of the best known in world football, with the iconic clash in many ways representing more than a mere sporting rivalry. Bragging rights are always at stake when the two teams meet, with El Clasico resonating deeply in Spain. So how do their head-to-head records in the women's game compare and who has the most trophies? GOAL brings you everything you need to know. Highlights from the first leg can be watched below: Barcelona have the upper hand on Real Madrid when it comes to head-to-head results between the women's sides, with the Catalan outfit winning all of their Clasico encounters to date since 2020. Competition Games played Barcelona wins Real Madrid wins  Draws Primera Division Femenina 4 4 0 0 Women's Champions League 1 1 0 0 Supercopa Femenina 1 1 0 0 Total 6 6 0 0 *Table correct at time of writing on March 28, 2022. Firmly established as a force of women's football in Spain, Barcelona might be said to enjoy an advantage over their Clasico counterparts, who were only formally established in 2020, having merged with CD Tacon. The two teams have naturally met in the Primera Division Femenina, but have also collided in the Supercopa Femenina and, in 2021-22, they faced off in the Women's Champions League. Barcelona have won many more trophies than Real Madrid in women's football. However, the lop-sided nature of the two trophy cabinets is down to the fact that Real's women's team were only officially founded in 2020, with their first full season coming in 2020-21.  Competition Barcelona Real Madrid Primera Division Femenina 7 0 Copa de la Reina 8 0 Supercopa de Espana 2 0 Women's Champions League 1 0 Total 18 0 *Table correct at time of writing on March 28, 2022. Barcelona have won a record seven league titles and they also hold the record for the Copa de la Reina, which they have won on eight occasions. Barca have also enjoyed continental success, lifting the Champions League once, in 2020-21, while they have won the Supercopa de Espana twice. Despite only embarking on their first season in 2020-21, Madrid did manage a second-place finish in the league in their maiden campaign, though they were 25 points behind the Blaugrana on that occasion.

6021,How fortunes are changing for the England team that once needed Neville & Milner donations to compete,"When Great Britain’s women’s deaf football team needed to raise almost £20,000 ($26,000) to compete at the Deaflympics in 2016, it was Manchester United legend Gary Neville that provided it. When the team needed £10,000 ($13,000) to go to the World Cup earlier that year, England internationals Jack Butland and James Milner came through with £5,000 each ($6,500). It was incredible generosity from these star names, who took huge pressure off the self-funded team. Every time they qualified for a major tournament, players needed to raise their own money to go. However, these gestures put the lack of contribution from governing bodies under the microscope. Fast forward to 2022, and that is changing, with the Football Association launching a three-year plan to help develop, improve and raise awareness of disability football in England. Among many other things, it means that disability teams should no longer have to worry again about whether they can afford to participate in a major tournament they have qualified for. I will do it if they won't. https://t.co/e86a5WibOf Baroness Sue Campbell, who has helped to advance the women’s game massively, has overseen the plan, which she wants “to be owned by everybody”. “All of that is part of laying the foundation to say, 'Right, we're taking this seriously' – not that individuals didn't take it seriously before, but the organisation didn't take it seriously before,” Campbell tells GOAL. Speaking with members of the England team, the importance of one area stressed in the plan is highlighted: awareness. Danielle Evans, the youngest player ever to represent England aged 14, is partially deaf and played ‘mainstream’ football her whole life. She didn’t know the deaf women’s team existed until Everton put her forward to play for England. She didn’t know sign language either, though has since learned it – something that has had huge benefits for her at work as a paramedic, as well as with the national team. Jennifer ‘Fer’ Evans, meanwhile, recalls there “never really [being] much information” around the national teams.  “You still have quite a lot of communication with people and they're like, 'Oh, what do you mean you play for the deaf team?'” she explains. “It's important that players don't get to 16 or 18 or whatever and are like, 'There's nothing for me to do here. I might as well just give up my dreams of representing England.' When really, there is, it hasn't had the awareness yet.” With resources, coaching and much more improving too, Evans hopes those changes can help push England and Great Britain to the next level, the teams having won five bronze medals between them since 2008. “We’re all fed up with bronze,” she says. “We love coming home with a medal, but we want to get that silver or that gold. It is fantastic that we got bronze self-funded but now, funded, let's see how far we can go.” Head coach Sammy Ligg is tasked with that aim, alongside assistant Lauren Asquith, who works across the disability teams as the England female para lead. “I always say, sometimes it's like the best kept secret, this opportunity,” Asquith, who has worked in disability sport since she was 18 years old, says. “It opens a whole world of different things and different dynamics. “We've got this exciting opportunity, but also the pressure to make it a high performing team.” “The first thing we all said as a team when we had our first discussions was just gold. That was the only word that was ever mentioned,” Ligg says. “It's easy to say it. It’s looking [and asking]: What do we need to do and what do we need to put in place to allow that to happen? I feel like the first few camps have been the starting process of making that happen.” Asquith is quick to jump to answer a question about the FA’s new plan and what stands out. The two new female international squads by 2024 – a blind team and a cerebral palsy team – is one thing.  The pathway to the senior team is another, something Ligg says they are already across, having highlighted young players ready to make the progression. The third is the coaching support available and experts around the team. For Asnath Losala, who is profoundly deaf and whose language is British Sign Language (BSL), extra support is very important. Losala was born in the Congo, grew up in South Africa and moved to England aged 13. John Harper is her interpreter. He worked at the deaf school she attended in England and tells a story of how Losala completely galvanised it, the entire place “devastated” at the time, having sadly lost an incredibly popular student a few months prior.  “She probably helped us more than we helped her. She's brilliant,” he adds. Despite establishing herself as an international footballer, Losala does not play for a club, because it’s simply too difficult to find one with understanding of her needs for BSL. “We can try and gesture but I'm not getting the right information,” she explains, via Harper.  “I'm getting that something is going on, I'm sort of finding that second-hand information, I'm catching the information later. I need the interpreter there full-time, but the funding is not there for other clubs. “I just want to get involved in teams. Use the interpreter, then get [them] out of the way. Basically, I just try run along with it. What can I do except just try get involved? It’s frustrating.” With England, that’s no problem. Harper is there, a lot of the players know BSL and the coaches are aware of making sure instructions are clear. “Coaching position and the planning side of things – you've got to really think about how you're going to communicate that information,” Ligg, who was appointed as head coach last year, explains. “I think it actually makes you a better coach, because you take that extra time to try and put yourself in different people's shoes and look at what's going to be the most effective way.” There have been a lot of improvements over the years. Fer Evans is still stunned that she’s training on the same pitches as England’s Lionesses.  “It's awesome to see how far it's come,” she says. That there’s no longer a need to fundraise is “a relief” too, Danielle Evans adds. “It's a privilege. Not many players get to experience this. It feels quite professional as well – where it should be, really.” But Losala’s experiences highlight problems that still need to be addressed – problems the FA is in no way pretending don’t exist. “We still have a lot of work to do,” Campbell admits. “We're on the beginning of a journey. “If it was a book, I'd say we're in chapter one or two, written by our pioneers, individuals who forced change because of their passion and their individual desire. “This plan is not built on just pioneers. It's built on the whole of the Football Association saying this is now our plan. All of us have got to get behind it. “That means we've got to get the right investment, we've got to get the right support and we've got to work at getting the right opportunities. “I'd be kidding you if I said we're there. We're a long way from being there, but that's the ambition.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fortunes-changing-england-team-neville-milner-donations/bltb2640413e2d00293,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

The Brazil-born right-back, who has played for the club since 2012 and represented Russia at both the 2018 World Cup and Euro 2020, has been sanctioned to return to his home country, citing burnout. But Fernandes - who is expecting a child - says that his decision is not motivated by ongoing international events, and even suggested that he could yet return to the team sometime down the line. ""Lately I've been feeling colossal tiredness and great exhaustion, and I can't give everything I've always given for the benefit of CSKA,"" Fernandes said in a video posted to social media. ""I've been playing football professionally for 13 years, of which I spent 10 years at CSKA. ""I asked to be allowed to spend some time with my family in Brazil. I am very grateful to them for the fact that they treated my request with understanding and agreed to let me go. After the match with Rostov, I fly to Brazil. My contract will be suspended. ""I would especially like to make it clear that I am leaving Russia not because of recent events in the world and not because of a difficult period in the life of the team. I have always helped and will help the club in any way I can."" As it stands, domestic and international sanctions remain against Russia in relation to football activities, for both clubs and the national team. Sides will not be able to enter European competition next season and remain barred from competing in the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League.

6132,'I don't think it's sunk in that I'm a Liverpool player' - Reds star Missy Bo Kearns is living the dream,"Liverpool star Missy Bo Kearns grew up as an obsessive supporter of the Reds, and so now being a star of the club's women's side is something she is still getting her head around.

6155,‘I had a lot of frustration’ - How Chelsea’s Jess Carter went from ‘not really playing’ to being a star again,"Ask a player to highlight their favourite trophy win, and most will pick their first. Ask Chelsea’s Jess Carter that question, and she has good reason to pick differently. The 24-year-old has won six titles since moving to west London from Birmingham four years ago, but it is the latest of that haul that stands out for a player who, on Sunday, will try to help Chelsea reach Wembley again as they take on Arsenal in the Women’s FA Cup semi-finals. “I'd probably say last year's FA Cup,” Carter tells GOAL, after only a slight pause to think. “That was big for me because it was one of the first trophies where I feel like I've played more and contributed more on the pitch. “As much as everybody can say it's a team sport and we all win the trophies, having not played much and won trophies, and played more and won trophies, I can definitely say it feels better feeling like you've contributed more on the pitch.” When a young player joins a big club, there are always people who question whether the timing is right, but when Carter moved to Chelsea, she knew it was. “I loved my time at Birmingham, but I got to a place where I started to get a bit complacent,” she admits. “Because we didn't have the luxury of having as much depth at Birmingham, I felt like I started to - I wouldn't say I ever stopped trying, but I stopped maybe taking it as seriously, being as professional as I should. “I just seemed to kind of coast through quite a bit towards the end of my time at Birmingham. For me to be a better player, I couldn't do that. At that time, I felt like I needed to be in a more professional environment that would help push me to that level. “Everyone talks about yes, you have to set your own standards, but I don't know many 19-year-olds that are able to be super professional and lead the way. Sometimes you just need a bit of help from the environment and that's what I felt I could get coming to Chelsea.” In her first season, she was a regular starter, but the following two campaigns would see her fill more of a squad role for the first time in her career. “You want to win, that's why you play, but you also play for the game time,” she says. “For people that don't get much game time, it is difficult and it is about trying to find a good balance. “Ultimately, it's the manager that selects you and all you can really do from a player perspective is give your everything, every day, so that you don't leave anything [behind] and hopefully that'll be enough to give you minutes. “If not, you have to figure out the role that you are to play at your club and just do that role the best you can to help the team be successful. “It's a really difficult process when you're not in a team. Obviously, you believe that everybody has your best interests at heart, but sometimes you think you should play when you're not playing, and other people think you should be playing when you're not playing. “You can go to Emma [Hayes, Chelsea manager] and ask her what you need to be doing and she'll tell you directly about why you're not playing, most of the time, and what you need to do. But we are also very well aware that we have a team with great depth and if you're not on your top game, then you can be replaced. “There were plenty of times when I’d have a lot of frustration with Emma because I wasn’t getting the game time that I felt like I deserved but, equally, there are the reasons that she didn't play me and I respect those reasons. “But I had a great group of girls around me to make me feel valued in the team and appreciated. I think we could all turn around and say that we have a great dressing room and the girls are often what drives you to keep going each day.” Carter’s rejuvenation came around 12 months ago, when Chelsea were hit by absences going into the second-leg of their Women’s Champions League quarter-final with Wolfsburg. Hayes would often tell the 24-year-old to make sure to be ready if called upon – and she was. “For me, it was almost a situation of, 'it can't really get much worse',” Carter says, with a laugh. “I had a bit of [a feeling of] relief and no pressure because it was: 'You haven't had any minutes anyway, so you can't do any worse than what's happened so far. Just go and play and do your best'. “I'd probably say I felt quite free going into the game, whereas maybe some people might be slightly stressed having not many minutes. It was just a 'what will be will be' kind of moment.” Fast forward a year and Carter is a regular again – be it at right-back, wing-back or centre-back. She was crucial in Chelsea’s run to last year’s Champions League final and their Women’s Super League title triumph, as well as that FA Cup win. She has also been recalled by England, which “totally shocked” her. When she made her comeback appearance against Austria in November, her second cap, it was one day short of being exactly four years since her first. Now, she wants more trophies. Chelsea are in pole position to win the WSL for the third year running and could reach the FA Cup final on Sunday. There have been lows in this season - in December, the Blues were knocked out of Europe in the group stages and last month they were beaten by Manchester City in the League Cup final - but they have not dampened Carter’s mood. They are only driving her more. “I think that gives me an extra bit of motivation,” she says. “I want to be leaving this season with the FA Cup and with the league title. I think that is the same way for a lot of the players. “You're ready to go the extra mile again to make sure that we come away with the trophy.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/frustration-emma-hayes-chelsea-jess-carter-not-playing-star/blt7483e48a3112f6a1,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

6224,"'I have no anxieties' - Abramovich sale of Chelsea won't impact success of women's team, says Hayes","Chelsea women’s manager Emma Hayes insists that her side will continue to be a success despite the impending sale of the club by Roman Abramovich. Abramovich announced on Wednesday that he would sell the club after 19 years of ownership, having come under pressure due to his alleged ties with Russia president Vladimir Putin amid the invasion of Ukraine. During his tenure, the billionaire has massively supported the women’s team, which has won 11 trophies since 2014 and reached the Women's Champions League final last May.  Speaking in her pre-match press conference on Friday, on the eve of Chelsea’s Continental Cup final against Manchester City, Hayes said: “Chelsea has been a strong force and will remain a strong force going forward because of the people involved with this football club. “This is part of the reason why we have, as a football club, been hugely successful. It's an amazing culture, with amazing people internally. “I think we will come through this period and adapt and evolve, as you have to in this business. While there's uncertainty, athletes know that, football players know that, no thing remains the same and having that ability to acknowledge change when it happens, [and] adapt and evolve to that, I think, is what makes top, top class players what they are. “I feel like I have no anxieties or worry about our position or our status. “Chelsea are people and amazing people, across the club, leading in all sections. From [head of youth development] Neil Bath, to [men's head coach] Thomas Tuchel, to the work we’re doing here - we will be successful going forward, nothing has changed. “We’ve got a cup final tomorrow. Everyone is looking forward to that. I can’t control what’s being said in the media, what I know is that the team is focused and ready for another cup final tomorrow. “I think that one thing I know how to do really well is to cope with challenging situations and yes, there’s a challenge in the situation we’re in, but we’re not afraid of it. “I think the week has been difficult, of course it has, I can’t deny that, but nothing is more difficult than what Ukraine is going through. “We play football, we play a sport we love. Yes, there’s going to be some change but Chelsea will prevail and maintain, I think, the position that we’re in because of the amazing people that we have at our football club. “This is a successful organisation and it will remain a successful organisation and you won’t do that by breaking it up or going backwards. No, this football club is invested in its women’s team and I expect that to remain long and strong into the future.” While dealing with off-pitch turbulence in the build-up to Saturday’s final, Chelsea, who have won the last two editions of the Conti Cup, have been boosted for the game by the return of Magda Eriksson. The team’s captain has been out since before Christmas with an injury, but after a number of setbacks is now “in a really good place” and will be in the squad. Only Scotland international Erin Cuthbert and Germany midfielder Melanie Leupolz will be missing from the team, with Russian full-back Alsu Abdullina set to be involved after what Hayes understands will have been a “difficult” week for her, too, after her chance to compete in this summer’s UEFA Women’s Euro was taken away. UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said earlier this week that the team will not compete in the competition, which would’ve been Abdullina’s first major tournament. “I think you've got to realise, my job as a coach is to support her, not to judge, not to analyse,” Hayes said, asked about how she has managed the full-back this week. “It's just to listen and be there for her. “I'm sure it's been a difficult week. She doesn't speak much English so the communications we have has to be via translation. “What I know is that Alsu is a valued member of our team, part of our family, and it's important that we look out for her because she's, of course, going to have had a difficult week. “But she's a wonderful asset, a wonderful girl, and someone who I wish could speak more in English to her, but I can't. Until we get to that point where we speak the same language, I can't possibly understand what she's feeling this week.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/no-anxieties-worry-abramovich-sale-chelsea-impact-success/blt96bc2dd4939e8ce8,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6247,All of US: The U.S. Women's Soccer Show - Future USWNT & NWSL stars highlighted by NXGN,"There are so many exciting young stars in U.S. women's soccer right now, from NWSL Rookie of the Year Trinity Rodman to Lyon superstar Catarina Macario, and the release of GOAL's NXGN 2022 lists gives All of US: The U.S. Women's Soccer Show a great chance to look to the future. On this week's episode of the show, GOAL discusses some of the young talents that have already made their name in the senior game, while also highlighting some of those ready to break through in the next few years. It is not just American talent that is the subject of conversation, either, when projecting the players worth watching moving forwards. You can find All of US simply by searching for it on your preferred podcast platform, be that Spotify, Apple, or something else. Some of the most exciting young players in U.S. women's soccer that are mentioned in this week's show have appeared on previous episodes, which are available to listen back to. That includes Macario, who talked all about her decision to choose to play for the U.S. women's national team over Brazil, as well as Mia Fishel, one of the country's most exciting prospects who told GOAL why she chose to move to Mexico this year instead of playing in the NWSL. NXGN highlights the best young talent in the men's and women's games and, every year in March, lists of the best talents are published, too. This year, Borussia Dortmund's Jude Bellingham came out on top on the men's side, while Haiti and Reims midfielder Melchie Dumornay was crowned the best teenager in women's football right now. Dumornay will be a familiar face to some U.S. fans after competing against the USWNT in Concacaf competitions. Ranking at No.4 on the women's list was Alexis Missimo, who recently helped the United States' Under-20 national team win the Concacaf Championship. All of US talks all about why she is such a promising player and picks out some others to watch too. The inclusion of Tigres' Jana Gutierrez in the list also opens up a conversation on the show about what is happening in Mexico, while the Houston Dash's off-season signing of Paulina Gramaglia, the Argentina international who ranks at No.20, is one to watch as the NWSL campaign begins.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/all-of-us-us-womens-soccer-show-future-uswnt-nwsl-stars-nxgn/bltc7420dd562c96c12,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Smith, 21, is one of the USWNT's most promising young attackers and figures to be in contention for a key role at the 2023 Women's World Cup and 2024 Olympics Games. Head coach Vladko Andonovski's squad is attempting to move in a positive direction after settling for bronze last summer in Tokyo, and the play of their up-and-comers provides enthusiasm.

Since then, she's appeared in 18 senior matches for her country. A ""devastating"" ACL injury to 22-year-old forward Catarina Macario has opened the door for increased playing time for Smith, and she's taking advantage of the opportunity. Along with Smith and Macario, Mallory Pugh (24) and Trinity Rodman (20) give the USWNT a strong long-term attacking group. Rodman registered the team's fifth goal on Thursday after coming on as a substitute. This was the USWNT's second match in the summer competition, which is being hosted by Mexico. It has won both of its matches.

6319,Nigeria’s Oshoala on Barcelona Femini's defeat to Lyon: ‘It served as a stepping stone to be better’,"Nigeria star Asisat Oshoala has discussed how the Uefa Women's Champions League final defeat by Lyon in 2019 strengthened Barcelona. The Spanish club lost by a margin of 4-1 to the French club three years ago and are set to meet again in this season’s final in Turin on Saturday. ""It [2019] wasn't a good outcome for us, but it served as a stepping stone to be a better team,"" Oshoala told the BBC World Service. ""It was a learning process for us. Technically, it helped us to improve [in] all aspects. ""The following year, we lost to Wolfsburg in the semi-final, and then in 2021, we went ahead to win it. We're a different team now, much better than we were three years ago."" The Super Falcons forward scored against Lyon then as she came off the bench, and suggested their opponents have also improved in the last few years. ""They won the Champions League five years in a row, so they're obviously the team to beat here,"" added the former Liverpool and Arsenal player. ""They have amazing players and [an] amazing history when it comes to women's soccer in Europe. So I think you still expect the same Lyon as three years ago. They got better as well. ""They signed new players and tried to beef up the team, so I think they are much stronger than they were. But when it comes to football, it comes down to whoever utilizes their chances ends up winning the game."" Oshoala feels the final in Turin should not be reduced to a Ballon d'Or contest between Barcelona’s Alexia Putellas and Lyon’s Ada Hegerberg. ""It is not one person against one person, it is a team sport. This is not tennis or darts,"" the Nigerian concluded.  ""The Alexia that I know, she's not a person who puts these things in her mind. She is a player who is very humble. ""We have Lieke [Martens], Caroline [Graham Hansen], myself, we have the goalkeeper [Sandra Panos]. At Lyons they have Dzsenifer Marozsan, Wendi [Renard], and a whole lot of top players in their team. ""It is not about who is superior. I think it is lame to do this type of comparison.""

6389,England-Germany final breaks attendance record for Euros match,"England and Germany set a new European Championship attendance record on Sunday after over 87,000 spectators flocked to the final at Wembley. The bumper crowd confirmed the tournament's success, as the hosts in particular have captivated the English public in their journey to the decider.  No other Euro game, in the men or women's tournament, has ever drawn as big an attendance as Sunday's game, which finished 1-1 after 90 minutes.  During the match it was confirmed that the final attendance reached 87,192, almost the entire Wembley capacity.  Not only was it the biggest crowd ever recorded for a women's Euro game, but any game in the competition, and significantly higher than the 67,173 which attended Wembley to watch the Euro 2020 final between England and Italy last summer.

6415,Lyon's win over PSG sends message to Barcelona as they book place in UWCL final,"A little less than a year ago, Lyon relinquished their Women’s Champions League title for the first time since their relentless run of five successive triumphs began in 2016. Next month, though, they will go to Turin to do battle with the Barcelona team that took it from them, having overcome Paris Saint-Germain 2-1 at a hostile Parc des Princes on Saturday night, and 5-3 on aggregate in their semi-final tie. The last time Lyon were not European champions was a spell between 2013 and 2016. They reached the final in the first of those three years, but went out in the last 16 the following two seasons. When GOAL asked Eugenie Le Sommer, a seven-time UWCL winner with OL, what the feeling was like in that period in a previous interview, the forward produced an answer that was telling of this team’s mentality. “I remember watching the games, the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the final, at home,” she recalled. “I said, ‘I don’t want to watch it again on my TV. I want to play these games’. “It’s a motivation for me, it was for the team too. I think this experience made us better and stronger in our mentality.” On Saturday, they faced the team that spoiled their season last year. PSG not only took their league title from them for the first time ever, but they knocked them out of the Champions League for the first time in seven years, too. The last time they were eliminated from the competition before that, in 2014, was also at the hands of PSG, in what was the club from the capital’s first win over France’s most illustrious side. The reasons why Lyon have been able to remain at the top and enjoy such wonderful success in the eight years since that result – with a chance to make it six titles in that time next month – lie in that round of 16 defeat. A look at the teams that day and you will see four names in the Lyon team that were also on the teamsheet at the Parc des Princes this weekend – Sarah Bouhaddi, Wendie Renard, Amandine Henry and Le Sommer. You will also see Amel Majri, who remains with the team but is absent due to an ACL injury. On PSG’s side, there is no player still at the club. Lyon has players in its squad that signed as long ago as 2006, while every player representing the Parisians made their club debut after 2015 – after that UWCL win over Lyon. While there are a lot of new faces involved for OL, too, the consistency, experience and chemistry than runs throughout the team is steeped in that continuity. The head coach, Sonia Bompastor, only adds to that, having won 11 trophies during her six years at the club as a player. On top of that this season, though, is a bit of a chip on their shoulder. While Lyon had a difficult season last year, Barcelona had an unstoppable one, drawing well-deserved praise for their treble-win. But, as Ada Hegerberg alluded to in the build-up to this semi-final, there is perhaps a feeling within Lyon’s camp that their success and achievements have been forgotten about. It’s added a fuel to the fire in a team that already consists of many of the world’s best - be it the 2018 Ballon d’Or winner in Hegerberg, the scorer of the game’s first goal; or the first player to reach 100 UWCL appearances in Renard, scorer of the second. This semi-final victory allowed them to exorcise some of the demons of last season while sending a message to Europe: We are still here and we are here to win. It’s fitting, then, that the final will see them take on the team that so many have spent the past year talking about instead. ""When you win all the time - even in Lyon, it was kind of normal for us to win - but in some way, it's good sometimes to just wake up and understand that, 'OK, we have to work harder and do it again',” Lotta Schelin, the legendary former Lyon striker, told GOAL in a past interview, when presented with Le Sommer comments about those years without the UWCL title. “That's why Lyon, as a team, as a club, they are amazing, because winning, okay, that's hard enough, but losing and then coming back… “That's when you can see the real winners.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lyon-s-win-over-psg-sends-message-to-barcelona-as-they-book/blte0967786b6a6470b,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6421,Liverpool boss Klopp & Adelaide's Cavallo shortlisted for LGBT awards,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp and Adelaide United left-back Josh Cavallo are among the headline football nominees for the 2022 British LGBT Awards. The duo headline a raft of names from across the game, with USWNT international Megan Rapinoe and England duo Beth Mead and Demi Stokes also feted across this year's slate. The awards ceremony will be held on June 24, with members of the public invited to vote before then for the winners across multiple categories. While the Reds boss is not in the running for the main prize of Sports Personality, he is nominated for Celebrity Ally, which honours those figures in the public eye who seek to champion LGBT causes. Klopp has been recognised for his work in aiming to prevent homophobic chanting from Liverpool supporters, urging fans to refrain from such actions in the wake of an incident involving Chelsea loanee Billy Gilmour at Norwich in August. In addition, he prominently supported Stonewall's Rainbow Laces campaign again and spoke out about the experiences of allyship during the Premier League's round table dedicated to the cause. Elsewhere, Adelaide left-side option Cavallo is nominated for the central Sports Personality award after he came out as gay in October, becoming the first current professional top-flight footballer to do so. The Australia youth international joined the Coopers Stadium outfit from Western United in February last year on a short-term deal before signing a new two-year contract. He is joined in the main category by OL Reign winger Rapinoe, Arsenal forward Mead and Manchester City left-back Stokes. Outside of football, the remaining nominees for the central honour are drawn heavily from those involved with last year's rearranged Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics - or those unable to compete. Diver Tom Daley, weightlifter Laurel Hubbard, skateboarder Alana Smith and paracanoeist Emma Wiggs are all listed, as are runner Caster Semenya, who was not permitted to defend her title in controversial circumstances. Former hurdles star Colin Jackson rounds out the main list, while Lewis Hamilton is nominated alongside Klopp for Celebrity Ally.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-klopp-adelaide-cavallo-shortlisted-lgbt-awards/bltb3a0d49b1ce8651d,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6469,England star Kirby 'wasn't even able to walk the dog' amid fatigue-related absence,"England star Fran Kirby knows she must be careful in training as she looks to compete for a spot in England's squad for the 2022 UEFA Women's European Championship after a lengthy absence. Kirby has not played a match since February, having been ruled out indefinitely with fatigue but was named in the provisional squad for the tournament by coach Sarina Wiegman. The Chelsea forward has opened up about her troubles with fitness, admitting that she did not even have enough energy to walk her dog during another bout of health trouble.  ""It's been an interesting few months for me but I'm happy to be here and be involved,"" Kirby said. ""It was really tough. I've had previous experiences with illness so it was hard to take. At the time I wasn't really caring about football or training but I think I dealt with it really well. ""You lose a lot of stuff you usually do. I wasn't even able to walk the dog for five minutes so it's been nice to do that again. Hopefully now I can continue pushing."" She continued: ""I feel good and hopefully I can be involved and get some training in. ""I have to try hard but also do the right things to make sure things don't happen again. I know I have to perform to be able to get back into the squad but also do it in a safe way. ""I know my body now and what I can do. I've said to Sarina and the coaching staff that I will be honest and I will know if I'm not right."" Chelsea boss Emma Hayes confirmed in April that the 28-year-old would be out for ""the foreseeable future"" as she struggled with fatigue. It is not the first time the forward has been kept out for a long period. In late-2019, she was diagnosed with a heart condition and kept out for around nine months.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-star-kirby-wasn-t-even-able-to-walk-the-dog-amid-fatigue-/bltbd9ead2a76720ac7,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Mexico women's manager Monica Vergara keeps her role for now, but will be reviewed by the new management structure when it is in place. The news was officially announced on Wednesday by FMF president Yon de Luisa following a series of underwhelming displays by the women's team and the men's U20s. De Luisa told a press conference: ""The results obtained in recent weeks by the men's U20 team and the senior women's national team, which signified a heavy blow to Mexican soccer, and above all, for our fans, forces us to act."" He said replacements for those sacked would be announced in the next few days. Perez oversaw a dreadful campaign in the 2022 CONCACAF U20 Championship, in which Mexico lost to Guatemala in the quarter-finals on penalties. As a result Mexico have failed to reach both the 2023 U20 World Cup or the 2024 Olympics in Paris. It was a similarly bleak story for the women's team, with Vergara's charges dumped out in the group stage of the CONCACAF Women's Championship. Mexico hosted the tournament, however were humiliated as they lost all three group games without scoring a goal. As a result, they have failed to reach the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, or the Olympics.

Emma Hayes’ side appeared to be making hard work of things as 2021-22 came to a close, with Arsenal waiting to pounce on any untimely stumbles, but they got the job done in a 4-2 victory over United. CHELSEA.

They were made to work for the right to claim another major trophy, with Martha Thomas firing United in front after 13 minutes at Kingsmeadow. Erin Cuthbert restored parity five minutes later, but the Red Devils restored their lead in the 25th minute through Ella Toone.

Tottenham have said in a statement on the club’s official website: “Chioma was prescribed two forms of medication in the United States from a personal doctor to treat acne before signing for the club. “The 29-year-old continued to take the medication to treat her skin condition after she arrived without the knowledge that the medication was prohibited. “In November 2021, Chioma requested a repeat prescription from the club doctor who alerted the relevant bodies; the FA and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) about the use of a banned substance. “The FA accepts that Chioma did not take the medication, spironolactone, with a view to intentionally securing an illegal advantage. “Both the Club and Chioma fully cooperated with the FA and UKAD during the disciplinary process and Chioma has been unavailable for selection since the provisional suspension was imposed in January. “Chioma takes full responsibility for the charge and deeply regrets her actions admitting a lack of knowledge and awareness on her part.” Ubogagu will not be available for selection at Spurs until she has served her entire ban, which is due to run until October 2022. She has said: “I am so sorry to my team-mates and staff that I can’t be out on the pitch. The club has been fully supportive throughout this entire process, and I am so appreciative of all their help. My faith, family, and close friends have helped me immensely in this difficult time. I am eager to be back soon now that this has been resolved. “I want to make clear that the medication had no performance-enhancing effects for me, but I still made the mistake of not being as diligent as possible, and as a result I am unable to play the game I love until I serve my suspension. While my dermatologist is aware of my profession, it is also my responsibility to know more about the medications I am prescribed. “I plan to share my story and educate others on the severity of what can happen, and I hope I can help other athletes avoid situations like mine in the future.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tottenham-women-forward-chioma-ubogagu-suspended-nine-months-two-/bltcdfe43f670bd4c7a,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6634,'I felt like a rocket out there!' - How a sprint coach made Phil Foden faster,"It was a low-key conversation in a Liverpool coffee shop which ended up changing Tony Clarke’s life. “I suppose you could say I became an overnight success,” he tells GOAL, smiling. “But it took me 25 years to get there!” Clarke – nicknamed 'Madness' on account of his apparent childhood resemblence to the 1980s ska band – is a coach at the famous Liverpool Harriers running club, which has produced the likes of Steve Smith, Anyika Onuoura and Katarina Johnson-Thompson, among others. A talented long-distance runner himself, he combined the role with his day jobs, organising dance events while running a vending machine business. At the Harriers, he worked with high-class athletes, Olympians and Paralympians, as well as coming across various footballers, rugby players and boxers out on the track. Then, in late-2019, came a chat with Owen Brown. Brown is the representative of Manchester star Phil Foden. He and Clarke go way back, and meet regularly at Antonio’s in Liverpool’s Metquarter. Jamie Carragher will often join them, as will Liam Smith, the former world light-middleweight boxing champion, or Bradley Orr, the former Blackburn and QPR defender. “We put the world to rights,” laughs Clarke. ""They should have a camera on us, it'd be TV gold."" Anyway, on this particular occasion, Brown began talking about Foden and his dribbling prowess, only for Clarke to interrupt. “I told him ‘He could be so much quicker, you know?’” Clarke says. “I explained why, and that was that. I thought no more of it. We carried on with our day. “Anyway, a few days later, the phone rings. Unknown number. ‘Hiya, it’s Phil Foden.’ I was like ‘Alright, mate, whatever!’ But then he mentions Owen, so I know it’s him.  “We ended up chatting on the phone, I explained what I meant, that I felt he could be quicker off the mark, and he said ‘OK, can I come down and see you?'"" Foden and Clarke met on a cold evening at Wavertree Athletics Centre, where Clarke sought to correct the imperfections he had spotted. “It was his first three steps,” he explains. “His stride was too long. He needed to shorten it so that his foot landed underneath his body, underneath his hips. “If you overstride, you land on your heel. So, essentially your foot stays on the floor for too long. I felt if he could change from a heel-striker into a front-of-the-foot striker, it’d add so much.” And so, over the course of eight sessions, they got to work. “We started with some really simple exercises,” he says. “Ladders, footwork drills, working on his stride. “The first thing you notice with Phil is that he wants to learn. I’ll be honest, I thought he might show up for one or two sessions and that’d be it, but he understood what I was saying, what I wanted him to do. “After a couple of sessions, I started showing him videos of NFL players. Short distances, accelerations, change of direction.  “I told him 'Imagine a clock face. You’re at a standing start, and I want you to go to 12, one, two, three o’clock and so on. What do you need to do?' “You watch the NFL players, and it’s the feet. They move first, pointing in the direction they want to go. Then, the arms start pumping, and off they go. “Phil, if he wanted to change direction, he’d sidestep first and then turn his body. But if you do that, you’re not using your quads, hamstrings, glutes. You’re not generating any power or momentum. “So, we did a load of ‘Hexagon’ drills. He’d be in the middle, rattling his feet, and I’d shout ‘two o’clock’, ‘nine o’clock’, ‘six o’clock’, and off he’d go. ""We worked on that change of direction with his foot, then pumping the arms so that the legs would follow.” Lockdown, of course, would disrupt their progress, but Foden remained keen to continue the improvement he had seen from those initial sessions. “He asked me to come up to his house and do some work with him in the back garden,” Clarke says. “And when I say back garden, it’s more like a football pitch! “We’d do some more speed and agility work. He has a goal up, and we’d have a bit of a mess around there. ""I’ve got some videos of him on my phone whipping free kicks into the top corner, landing balls in this trampoline net from 30 yards. Ridiculous!” By the time City returned to training, post-lockdown, Foden could feel the difference. “He said in one of the first sessions back, Pep Guardiola commented on his sharpness off the mark,” Clarke grins. “So, he told him he’d been working with a sprint coach, explained what we’d been doing, and Pep said ‘Keep doing it!’ “The first game back, he came off the bench and scored [against Arsenal]. Then, in the second, he scored two and was man of the match [against Burnley]. He rang me five minutes after the end and was like ‘Oh my God, mate, I felt like a rocket out there!’ “He could see the improvement, and I think everyone can now. He is lightning off the mark now, and he can sustain it for 90 minutes too.” For Clarke, those few months proved transformative. It was Foden, among others, who encouraged him to go full-time with his coaching. He helped set up an Instagram account, @needforspeed100, and the endorsement of one of the Premier League’s biggest stars meant more clients would follow. Clarke now works with a host of footballers, from youth team players such as Manchester United’s Charlie McNeill, Manchester City’s Lewis Fiorini and Wigan’s James Carragher (son of Jamie), to Liverpool Womens star Missy Bo Kearns and established mens professionals such as Lee Peltier (Middlesbrough) and Jon Flanagan (HB Koge).  Snooker legend Ronnie O'Sullivan drops in occasionally too. Conor Coady, the Wolves and England defender, is another client. “I’ve known him since he was at the academy at Liverpool,” Clarke says. “I went down to Kirkby to observe him for 10 days, a long time ago, and his flaws were obvious. ""He landed flat-footed, and when he ran, he looked like he had his hands in his pockets. There was no angle to his running stride, so he was not generating enough momentum.  “We did loads of work on that, ladders and drills to reduce contact time and get him pushing through quicker, driving the arms.  “I kept in touch with him right through, sending him drills and ideas. Then, in the summer, just after the Euros, we got together for a few sessions. We did the Hexagon drill I’d done with Phil, working on his foot positioning. “He said afterwards 'F*cking hell mate, for two years, Nuno [Espirito Santo] has been telling me there’s something not quite right about your feet, and now it all makes sense!’  “I sent him a Hexagon to his house and told him to use it once or twice a week. I told him 'Just move your feet, different directions. Consistency, repetition.' ""He sends me messages now that he’s been working on it. That’s Conor, the ultra professional.” It’s clear, from an hour in Clarke’s company, that he loves his work. He speaks with passion, and has a story for every occasion. He studies other sports – particularly NFL – religiously, and keeps a record of the fastest players in the Premier League. Foden, he says, is desperate to reach No.1 on the list, but competition, from known speedsters such as Sadio Mane, Adama Traore, Kyle Walker or Allain Saint-Maximin, or from surprise inclusions such as Leicester’s Caglar Soyuncu, who topped the 2019-20 list, is fierce. “It’s changed the way I watch games,” he laughs. “I’m a Liverpool fan, and I look at someone like Trent Alexander-Arnold and think he can be quicker. He’s another over-strider. “I’m a bit worried about [Ibrahima] Konate too. If a forward gets close to him and takes off, he’s done for. “People think if you’re tall, you naturally don’t have acceleration. But who’s the fastest person ever? Usain Bolt. How tall is he? 6ft 5in!  “I’d love to work with Trent on shortening his stride. I’d have him running up little steep hills, 10-15 yards. The same with Konate, same with the young lad, Rhys Williams. They’re unbelievable athletes, but they can be quicker.  “It’s good to be quick once you get into your stride, but in the Premier League it might be too late by then!” He adds: “It’s speed endurance, doing it for 90 minutes. You look at what players do now in a game. They can run up to 12km, they’re doing 40-50 sprints, and they’re doing thousands of accelerations and decelerations.  “So, if you’re improving speed endurance, improving acceleration and deceleration by even half a per cent, it’s huge. That’s what Phil was able to do, and the benefits are there for everyone to see.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/sprint-coach-tony-clarke-man-city-star-foden/blt7627bfb80b974f8b,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6650,Why did things not work out for USWNT star Tobin Heath at Arsenal?,"Arsenal head coach Jonas Eidevall described Tobin Heath as a ""points player"" upon the USWNT star's arrival at the club. “She wins you points and makes the difference in games at the highest level,” he said. With Heath a childhood supporter of the Gunners, it was a dream move but, as it transpired, injuries wouldn’t let her be the player Eidevall described. On Thursday, her premature departure was announced. After making her debut in a 5-0 win over Manchester City in late September, niggling muscle injuries meant the 33-year-old would only play 17 of Arsenal’s next 32 games. She didn’t play 90 minutes once and scored three goals. As for points those goals won the club? Just the one. Though surely a relief for Arsenal’s opponents, it was a shame for any neutral watching the WSL that a player with such quality was not on show much. This is someone who has won two NWSL Championships, two World Cup titles and two Olympic gold medals, all while being one of the best players in the world. However, it was fitting that the single point her goals won for Arsenal could be one that makes a huge difference when the title race does come to its conclusion. The Gunners were away at Manchester City and the game was deep into stoppage time, with the hosts 1-0 up. That was until the ball kindly found its way to Heath on the left-hand side of the box and she arrowed it through a sea of City defenders, into the bottom corner, to seal a point in a controversial finish. The contrast in emotions as the net rippled was a sight to behold. Lucy Bronze, City’s well-decorated right-back, threw herself to the floor as Arsenal striker Stina Blackstenius threw her arms in the air. It’s not just big moments like that which Arsenal will miss from Heath. It’s what she brings to the team off the pitch that was equally huge. To lose that as the title race is coming to a head is a blow. An insight into just what that is like was offered after the Gunners fell behind against Brighton in January, but came back to win 2-1. “From the whole team it was an impressive second half,” Eidevall said. “It’s not easy but we have great players for it. It’s great to have a player like Tobin Heath who said in the dressing room at half-time: ‘Remember that it’s better when it’s hard.’ That gave us perspective.” What so many of Arsenal’s young forwards will have learned from having Heath as a team-mate will have been crucial. What the defenders will have learned, too, coming up against a player of her quality in training, will have been as big. HEATH WITH THE EQUALISER 🇺🇸@TobinHeath at the death for @ArsenalWFC 😱Watch the #BarclaysFAWSL live on @SkySports 📺 pic.twitter.com/ZSyqs5a1Yn “I think there are a lot of reasons that it has worked out that way so far, if you look at the injuries she picked up at unfortunate timings,” Eidevall said just last month, reflecting on a difficult season for Heath. “We haven’t been able to quite get her over them well enough to complete 90 minutes yet. It wasn’t part of the plan when we brought her in, and I would have loved to see her play 90 minutes more often in this team because she is a great player with really great qualities.” Upon her arrival at Arsenal, it was known that this wasn’t a signing that was going to shape the club’s new era under a new manager. Heath’s contract length wasn’t initially disclosed, but, in his first press conference after her arrival, Eidevall said that her stay would be “more short-term than long-term”. However, it’s disappointing that things worked out how they did, given Heath’s obvious world-class ability, big experience and genuine passion for the club. “Although I’m disappointed that my time at Arsenal has come to an early end, I have loved every minute of my time here,” she said on Thursday. “I would like to thank everyone at the club who has made me feel so welcome. Arsenal is a special club and this is a special group of players. “I have no doubt that they are bound for success in the near future and I’ll be supporting the team with the rest of the Arsenal family from now on.” Uncertainty surrounds Heath’s next move. Racing Louisville, the NWSL’s 2021 expansion team, took her rights from the Portland Thorns during the 2020/21 season, when she was shining in the WSL with Manchester United before injury cruelly cut things short again. But a first-ever collective bargaining agreement in the United States’ top-flight has given players in the league more control over their movement. Should she choose a club in her home country for the next chapter of her career, it appears it would not have to be Louisville. While the winger thinks about that, Arsenal will be looking to ensure this isn’t the last contact they have with her. The Gunners are one point behind league leaders Chelsea and need to be perfect in their final three games while hoping the Blues slip up, in order to take the title. But should they be able to send Heath a winners’ medal come the end of May, her goal in Manchester on that cold January evening will have been as crucial as any.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-did-things-not-work-out-for-uswnt-star-tobin-heath-at/blt454e1d7f302882b3,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

6711,Houston Dash coach James Clarkson suspended amid NWSL abuse investigation,"The Houston Dash has suspended head coach and general manager James Clarkson. The suspension is “in light of initial findings, received this week, from the joint NWSL and NWSL Players' Association investigation that was launched last year to review current and historic complaints of discrimination, harassment and abuse”, the club said. It is effective immediately, with the Dash to name an interim head coach “in the coming days” ahead of the new NWSL season, which begins on Saturday, April 30. The Dash released the following statement on Tuesday: “The Houston Dash announced today that it has suspended head coach and general manager James Clarkson, effective immediately. “The suspension comes in light of initial findings, received this week, from the joint NWSL and NWSLPA investigation that was launched last year to review current and historic complaints of discrimination, harassment and abuse. “An ultimate decision about Clarkson's future with the Dash will be made based on the final results of the ongoing investigation. As an organization, our highest priority is creating and maintaining a safe and respectful work environment for our players and staff, which we believe is critical to our success on the pitch. The club has made counseling services available to all members of the organization interested. “The club will name an interim head coach in the coming days. To preserve the integrity of the ongoing investigation, the club cannot comment further at this time.” Clarkson was appointed by the Dash in late 2018, having previously worked with the Houston Dynamo and its affiliate club, Brazos Valley Cavalry. He coached the club to the Challenge Cup title in 2020. This news follows an incredible season of upheaval last year in the NWSL, during which five coaches departed their positions due to allegations of misconduct. Clarkson was the only coach in charge of an NWSL club at the beginning of the 2021 season that was still in their position at the beginning of 2022. NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said: “As it relates to this particular situation, I want to thank the individuals who brought their concerns to the joint investigative team, as well as Ted Segal, Jessica O’Neill and the Dash organization for taking swift action, and for their cooperation with the joint investigative team’s recommendation. “I want to thank the players and staff throughout the league who have participated in the overall investigation thus far, and assure them, as well as our fans and partners, that we will deliver on our promise to create a workplace where players and staff are empowered to succeed in a healthy and safe environment.” Meghann Burke, the executive director of the NWSL Players’ Association, added: “Players made a promise to ourselves and future generations to transform our League – not through words, but with our actions. “This shows that our joint investigation is doing the work of systemic transformation. The work continues, and we commend Players for speaking up and speaking out.” The NWSL also announced that, during this process, player protections in the NWSL policy to prevent and eliminate workplace discrimination, harassment, and bullying had been “expanded”.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/houston-dash-coach-james-clarkson-suspended-nwsl/blt3c207b0607baeded,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Sweden are among the favourites to lift the European Championship trophy this summer, but were in danger of going without a win in their opening two games of the tournament. That was until the intervention of 19-year-old Bennison, who came off the bench to score a fine goal in the sunshine at Bramall Lane, ultimately securing a 2-1 victory.

However, underdogs Switzerland responded immediately as Ramona Bachmann finished into the top corner from 18 yards following a poor punch out by the Swedish keeper. The Swedes had only led for 90 seconds. In the 68th minute, Everton midfielder Bennison was introduced off the bench - and it proved to be the game's pivotal moment. A little over 10 minutes later, she accurately shot from the edge of the area through a sea of bodies after a free kick was not properly cleared. It was a difficult first-time effort which she had to adjust her body for, but the teenager made it look easy as she swept the ball into the far corner, securing a priceless three points for her country. The Scandinavians are now in good shape to qualify from Group C after picking up four points from their opening two games, with Portugal left to face on Sunday.

6810,Williot Swedberg: Swedish wonderkid being linked with Barcelona,"On February 23, 2022, everything was ready for Williot Swedberg to join Lokomotiv Moscow. Only the minor details had to be sorted out before the Russian club would pay just over €4 million (£3.4m/$4.2m) to Hammarby for their teenage forward. Then, early in the morning of February 24, Vladimir Putin instructed the Russian army to invade Ukraine, sparking war on European soil. Swedberg's move was, understandably, cancelled. ""It became impossible, both morally and from the security point of view,"" Hammarby sporting director, Jesper Jansson, said. ""In addition, there was no need for us to sell the player."" ""Lokomotiv felt like a good project, but then things turned out to be like they were,"" Swedberg himself said after the move fell apart. ""I couldn't have imagined that would happen. ""Everyone wants to play abroad at a certain point, but it doesn't matter when. Now, it is going to be fun to play for my club."" Out of the darkness of his failed move, Swedberg has certainly been having fun in his native Sweden, with the 18-year-old the second-highest scorer in the early weeks of the Allsvenskan season. Williot Swedberg showar loss pic.twitter.com/foWbG94i3U The attacking midfielder has scored five goals in seven games to kick-off the campaign, though he did not begin the season as a starter, after being named on the bench for Hammarby's opening match of the campaign against Helsingborg. He was introduced as a late substitute, however, and went onto score the winning goal in a 2-1 victory, leading to him being asked to sing in his post-match interview. Swedberg chose to hum the fans' tribute to manager Marti Cifuentes, who commented: ""That improves his chances of getting a place in the starting line up!"" Whether it was his display on the pitch or his singing off it, Swedberg has nailed down a starting berth in the weeks that have followed. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: His double against Sundsvall particularly caught the eye, as Swedberg dicated the tempo of the game as he floated inside from his position on the left-hand side, performing turns in midfield that Zinedine Zidane would have been proud of. His superb strike from 25 yards with his supposedly weaker left foot was the cherry on top of what was already a pretty sensational cake. He followed that up with another brace two weeks' later against Sirius. This time, both strikes came from close range, showing the youngster's ability to be in the right place at the right time. And though his heroics so far this season have been headline-grabbing, those who saw him make his initial steps into the first team in 2021 are not overly surprised at Swedberg's development. It took the youngster just two minutes to make his mark on the Hammarby first team in July, with his goal against Degefors leading to Swedberg's father, Hans Eskilsson, weeping tears of joy in the stands. ""When Williot scored, the world stopped moving,"" Eskilsson said. ""I don't have the vocabulary to describe my feelings, which are stronger than when I was a player. It was just total euphoria."" Eskilsson himself enjoyed a notable playing career, becoming a Hammarby legend over three different spells with the club where he excelled as both a defender and as a striker. He was, however, hailed more for his passion than his technical ability, and it is possible that Swedberg inherited his ball control from him mother. Malin Swedberg was a magnificent midfielder in her playing days, and took part in the first Women's World Cup in 1991 as Sweden finished third, before going on to be crowned as the Swedish Player of the Year five years later. Her vision and passing range were outstanding, and such genes could explain why her son was able to show glimpses of his potential greatness from the age of just four. Vilken drömdebut! Williot Swedberg placerar vackert in 3-1 Se matchen på https://t.co/U8GJcAsMFu pic.twitter.com/LkZIk54PRX The Eskilsson-Swedberg family used to spend their summer holidays in Spain when Williot was young, and that gave him the chance to learn at the Valencia academy. ""They see football differently in Spain, and that is a big advantage,"" Eskilsson said. ""I think that Williot has a lot of non-Swedish qualities in his game."" That is definitely true. Swedberg is inventive and graceful, and is slenderly built despite standing at just over six foot (185cm). He will likely have to fill out physically to make it at the truly elite level, but in the meantime he is able to breeze past opponents thanks to his speed and ability to change direction, with his two-footedness making him a nightmare for opposition defenders to deal with. Able to play as a box-to-box No.8, as a No.10 or from a wide position, Swedberg has even been tried as a central striker at times, with his versatility another of his key attributes. ""Quality decision making and game understanding usually come with experience, but Williot is brilliant at his tender age"" Hammarby's chief scout, Mikael Hjelmberg, explained. ""He is one of the greatest talents to emerge at this club. In my opinion, he is the best Swedish player born in 2004."" A return to Spain could now be on the cards for Swedberg, if rumours of Barcelona's interest is to be believed. The Blaugrana were first linked with the Sweden youth international in the summer of 2021, and reports of them scouting Swedberg have intensified again following his fast start to the season, though there is a suggestion that Manchester United are also watching his development closely. ""I know I am not at the required level for Barcelona yet, but I wouldn't refuse if they wanted to sign me,"" Swedberg said amid the initial reports of interest from Camp Nou, though right now he could not be at a better club for his development. Hammarby currently sit top of the Allsvenskan table as they chase just their second national title, while Swedberg playing regularly could yet earn him a fast-track to the Swedish national team. The Scandinavian nation alreadly boasts an exciting group of young attackers that includes Dejan Kulusevski, Alexander Isak and Anthony Elanga, and Swedberg has the ability to thrive alongside them for at least the next decade. Whether he would have got the same opportunities to impress in Russia as he is now benefitting from is an unknown, but he is certainly making the most of it. A move to a bigger club than Lokomotiv Moscow now seems more than likely.

6821,Meet Sh'nia Gordon: The USWNT hopeful in Russia inspired by PSG & Lyon’s Olympic gold medallists,"'Oh my God, I beat Keisha!' That’s the text Sh'nia Gordon sent to her mother after practice the day she successfully dribbled past Kadeisha Buchanan for the first time, her former college team-mate who, today, is a four-time Champions League winner and an Olympic gold medalist. The Lyon star was already a full Canada international before she graduated, named the best young player at the 2015 Women’s World Cup, so to get the better of her was certainly worth the excitement. “She's such a good defender,” Gordon, now of CSKA Moscow, tells GOAL. “I guess since she used to be a forward, she just knows what I'm going to do. I don't know. She's just a step ahead. “She's fast so if you ever get past her, she's able to catch back up. She's smart. She's a good leader. She's a really hard defender to get by. Really hard.” Since the pair left West Virginia University, they are not the only two to land professional deals at big clubs. Ashley Lawrence, another Olympic gold medalist this summer, is at Paris Saint-Germain. Michaela Abam plays in the NWSL with the Houston Dash and represented Cameroon at the 2019 Women’s World Cup. Bianca St-Georges is also in the U.S. with the Chicago Red Stars. That’s just a taster of a long list. But it was Buchanan and Lawrence, both a couple of years older, that inspired Gordon. “They graduated college before me and they moved to PSG and Lyon and I'm like: 'Wow, they're in France. That's so cool. I want to go there. I want to play against them. I want to be in that league,'"" she explains. “Then, it all happened. I played against them. They actually inspired me to go there. “I entered the [NWSL] draft just to see. But I always wanted to be in France, that was my dream and that was the goal for me.” When an offer from Metz came in, Gordon remembers taking it “so quickly”. It was a move that introduced her to a totally different style to the “one-v-ones” and “fast play” she was used to in America. “I learned all this combination style. I improved my one touch ability, just little things like that,” she explains. A military kid who moved around a lot growing up, the experience of being abroad wasn’t particularly daunting and she was able to flourish as a result. Despite Metz's relegation, her individual performances impressed Dijon, for whom she scored seven goals last season as they finished eighth in the top flight. Then, this summer, she made another big move and joined CSKA Moscow, a club widely recognised across Europe. There were a few surprises when she arrived. Russia itself was one – in a good way. When she first walked into the dressing room for her first game, she got another when she saw the back of her shirt. “At first I was like, 'What is this?' And everyone is like, 'That's your name!'” she recalls. “Now that I understand the letters and everything, and I appreciate Russian culture and language and stuff, I actually love my jersey like that.” Gordon sounds shocked at herself when talking about how well her Russian is progressing too. For some, it might be surprising to see the forward continuing her journey in Russia, which doesn’t have the reputation of France in the women’s game. But Gordon was drawn to the size of CSKA, the second most successive club in the country, as well as the people running it. “When I was trying to decide if I wanted to go here, they really convinced me with their family-like atmosphere. The owner, he just loves family,” she explains. “We’re women at the end of the day. He encourages us to have a life. Get married, have kids and stuff, he's very big on that. That's just something I really like because you don't really get that from many coaches. “It's like ‘football, football, football’ and then women are constantly deciding, 'Oh, I want a baby, but I have to stop playing'. That's a big issue in women's sport. But him, he's very big on family.” With such a huge club, which she repeatedly praises for its professionalism, there is another dream that Gordon can chase. It’s one that her former college team-mates Buchanan and Lawrence know all about: playing in the latter stages of the Champions League. CSKA were narrowly beaten by Cypriot side Apollon Limassol in qualifying this year, but are determined to improve on that next season, while also aiming to take back the league title they won in 2019 and 2020. Winning the league sits at the top of Gordon’s goals. But for a player who played in college with some of the world’s best, who cites Cristiano Ronaldo as her favourite player, and who loves to watch Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool, the ambitions are big and certainly don’t stop there. “I'm hoping to get invited to a national team camp,” she says. “That's a personal goal of mine. And I'm hoping to score as many goals as I can.” With U.S. women’s national team players abroad becoming more of a normality than in the past, when it was seen as crucial to be in the NWSL, a path has now opened up from Europe. “I would love to be playing back at home and stuff, but it's just, honestly, for me at this moment, this part of my career, it is just better to be here,” Gordon says. “And I like it here.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/shnia-gordon-uswnt-hopeful-inspired-psg-lyon-olympic-gold/blt19adb7d23f535da6,Amee Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6859,Nketiah contract update revealed as Arsenal confirm full list of five players released on free transfers,"Arsenal have included Eddie Nketiah on their released list at the end of the 2021-22 campaign, but remain eager to point out that fresh terms could still be thrashed out with those that are currently heading towards free agency. Alexandre Lacazette has already agreed a return to Lyon after severing ties with the Gunners, with the experienced French forward heading home after five years that delivered 206 appearances and 71 goals in in north London. Premier League heavyweights will also be parting with three members of their academy ranks when their respective terms come to an end prior to June 30. The 23-year-old striker has been on the Gunners’ books since 2015 and made his senior debut in September 2017. He has had to be patient in pursuit of regular game time, with a loan spell taken in at Leeds during the 2019-20 season. It appeared at one stage as though he was destined to walk away from north London, as he remained down the pecking order in 2021-22, but forced his way into Mikel Arteta’s plans after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang departed for Barcelona and it became apparent that Lacazette would not be sticking around. Nketiah finished the season with a personal best goal return of 10 across 27 appearances and interest from the likes of Crystal Palace – who are managed by Arsenal legend Patrick Vieira – began to be shown. GOAL was, however, able to reveal towards the end of May that Nketiah was ready to perform a U-turn on his initial exit plans and commit to a contract extension. No agreement has been announced there as yet, but Arsenal have said when announcing their released list: “Please note, any further developments regarding players extending their contracts; joining/re-joining us; or leaving us will be officially communicated as soon as they are confirmed.” Eddie Nketiah is taking his chance 👏 pic.twitter.com/LQjhaV4Z7Z Alongside Nketiah and Lacazette, Arsenal have revealed that Jonathan Dinzeyi, Joel Lopez and Jordan McEneff will be leaving their U18 and U23 ranks. Confirmation has also been offered of USWNT star Tobin Heath severing ties with the club, along with Lisa Evans, Viktoria Schanderbeck and Lydia Williams – although the latter remains in talks regarding a new deal. Arsenal’s men’s side missed out on a top-four finish and qualification for the Champions League in 2021-22, with Arteta now drawing up plans on how to bolster his ranks so that a sustained push back towards elite European club competition can be made next term. The Gunners will, alongside the rest of their top-flight rivals, discover their schedule for 2022-23 when the Premier League fixture list drops at 9am BST on Thursday June 16.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/nketiah-contract-update-arsenal-five-players-released-free/blt311c1c94e50ed979,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6864,'It doesn't get any better!' - Liverpool Women set to receive Championship trophy against Sheffield United,"Liverpool Women will be presented with the FA Women’s Championship trophy on Sunday, with a bumper crowd expected for their home clash with Sheffield United. The Reds secured the title, and with it promotion to the FA Women’s Super League, with a 4-2 win over Bristol City earlier this month. Under the guidance of Matt Beard, who returned to the club as manager last summer, Liverpool have proven too strong for the competition, losing just one of their 20 league games and conceding only eight goals in the process. The trophy will be presented after Sunday’s home clash against Sheffield United at Prenton Park. The game will kick off at 12:00pm BST, in order to allow as many fans as possible to attend both the Women’s game and the Men’s Premier League clash with Everton at Anfield (kick off 4.30pm BST).  Tickets for the Sheffield United game are on sale now, and priced at just £1 for children under 16.  Speaking exclusively to GOAL this week, Beard paid tribute to his side, who have bounced back from the disappointment of missing out on promotion last season in some style. “My biggest challenge at the start was to try and create that positive atmosphere,” he said. “We had a tough start, but it’s like anything, you’ve got to get your head down, get on with it and work hard. “The togetherness of the group has been spot on. Everyone has played their part. And once you start winning games, mindsets start to change.” Beard has enjoyed success with Liverpool before, winning two WSL titles in his first spell with the club between 2012 and 2015, and says he is proud to have delivered promotion at the first time of asking this time around. “I’ve loved it,” he says. “It’s always a risk coming back, especially when you’ve had success the first time.  “But the thing is, when you work at this club and then you come away from it, you realise how special and unique it is. I’ve got nothing but good things to say about my first time here, but since I’ve been back the club has been nothing but supportive. “Me and my family love it here. The fans have been unbelievable, following us home and away. I was watching the [FA Cup] semi-final the other day and seeing the fans there, you just feel what the club means to the city and the people, and I’ve not seen that anywhere else.  “I feel lucky to have been able to come back. I had some conversations with other clubs, but once I knew Liverpool were interested in me it was a no-brainer.  “Sometimes you just fit somewhere, you know? Maybe this is where I’m meant to be!” For young midfielder Missy Bo Kearns, Sunday will be an extra-special day. A product of the club’s youth system, the 21-year-old Scouser has been one of the standout performers this season, earning recognition with England U23s, captaining Liverpool and being widely tipped as a potential WSL star of the future. “It’s so exciting,” she tells GOAL. “It doesn’t get any better, and I can’t wait to lift the trophy on the weekend! “You can’t buy these opportunities, you’ve got to work hard for them and you should be proud and privileged when they come about. Hopefully for me, and for this team, it is just the start.” Kearns, who emerged from the same grass roots team as men’s first-team star Curtis Jones, was part of the side which missed out on promotion last term, and credits Beard and his staff with ensuring this year’s team was ready to achieve success. “We deserve it,” she says. “We’ve shown a lot more togetherness this season, and played a lot of teams off the park.  “I think last season we were still affected a bit by relegation, but this season it’s been like a breath of fresh air, a new start. You have to be mentally tough to overcome these things, and with the new staff, the new players, it’s freshened everything up. “The manager is brilliant. He knows how to manage people, he’s experienced, and he sets us up to win every weekend. He’s been perfect. “With me, he’s helped me a lot, he’s changed me from a little kid on the pitch to an adult. He’s matured me as a player, he lets me be myself but he gives me confidence and takes the pressure off as well.” Kearns adds: “You can see how much everyone has enjoyed it this season. It’s competitive, but enjoyable at the same time, and everyone is together, which makes a big difference. “I’ve been taught the Liverpool way since I was eight years of age. I know how big this club is, I’ve been everywhere to watch them as a fan, and I love being part of it. I’m so proud of Liverpool, and to be part of a team that is successful is even better.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-women-championship-trophy-sheffield-united/blte98120d8697ecf81,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6885,Germany head into Arnold Clark Cup with at least 17 players missing as Voss-Tecklenburg bemoans 'energy-sapping' last few days,"Germany head coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg has detailed the “energy-sapping” build-up she and her team have endured ahead of the Arnold Clark Cup, with six players pulling out of her original squad picked for the tournament. Voss-Tecklenburg is without “12 to 14 important players” in her selection, with the likes of Lyon's Dzsenifer Marozsan, Chelsea’s Melanie Leupolz and Wolfsburg’s Alex Popp having already been out injured before she chose her team.  Indeed, the last few days have seen half a dozen more ruled out of the competition, which gets underway on Thursday when Germany face Spain, adding to the selection headache. Germany’s squad already featured a handful of lesser-known faces due to the large proportion of injuries that Voss-Tecklenburg was aware of last week. On Sunday, Svenja Huth (Covid-19), Lena Lattwein (illness) and Almuth Schult (quarantine) were all officially ruled out of the Arnold Clark Cup too. Four players were also identified as close contacts who had to test negative several times to be able to join the team for the tournament. Two days later, it was announced that two of those - Tabea Wassmuth and Kathrin Hendrich - had tested positive for Covid-19 and would also miss the upcoming games. On Monday, Sjoeke Nuesken was also ruled out of the tournament due to a positive test. Of the six players called up to replace these absentees, four are uncapped. “The last few days have been quite energy-sapping, I've got to admit,” Voss-Tecklenburg told the media on Wednesday. “Throughout Saturday, Sunday and Monday, we were losing players practically by the minute. “We knew before it was going to be difficult, either through injury or to Covid, so it's pretty serious. But having said that, it's unfortunate, though there's no way we can change things so I expect myself and my players to approach this situation with a solution-oriented state of mind. “Come first thing next week, I think everybody on our team - and that goes for the coaching staff, the players, the admin and the support staff - will have something to take home in terms of new experiences and having overcome new challenges. “We are missing 12 to 14 important players so it's only natural that the ones that we have called up will be getting more playing time and more minutes on the pitch than previously expected,” she added. “Obviously, with new players, newcomers and these players given new roles, it all changes team statics, the very core of the team. That said, I think we will have a very good starting line-up tomorrow in the game against Spain. “We also need personal feedback from players because do remember that the Wolfsburg players and Sara [Dabritz, of PSG], of course, will have weekend matches coming up right after this week, followed by many more midweek matches [in the Women’s Champions League] to end the season. ""It's a matter of looking from match to match and waiting for feedback from players and then determine starting line-ups on a match-to-match basis.” One of the four uncapped additions of the last few days is Ramona Petzelberger, the 30-year-old having represented her country at youth level, but never senior level. Asked what prompted her to call up the Aston Villa midfielder, Voss-Tecklenburg explained: “I've known her for quite a long time, in actual fact, since she was a teenager and we just thought to ourselves, 'Okay, who can help in this rather special situation?' “We thought that, in addition to calling up young and uncapped players, it will be good idea to have a 30-year-old woman who's seen a lot [and] done a lot in our squad as well. “We contacted her and, as it turned out, she was in Germany at the time on a parent visit and had nothing with her in the way of kit or anything. But that problem was soon solved, and she joined us for the first training on Tuesday. We're quite happy to have her with us today.” Tickets to watch England, Germany, Spain and Canada play in the Arnold Clark Cup are available now.

Canada, Olympic gold medallists in 2021; Germany, European champions a record eight times; and Spain, a nation on the rise after Barcelona's Women's Champions League triumph; are all participating in the competition, which will take place in three venues across England. The Lionesses will hope this serves as ideal preparation for this summer's Euros, also in England, which will kick off at Manchester United's iconic Old Trafford on July 6. Arnold Clark Cup fixtures will be played as double-headers, with one match played mid-afternoon before an evening game later that day. These games will take place across three venues in England: Riverside Stadium in Middlesbrough, Carrow Road in Norwich and Molineux Stadium in Wolverhampton. Tickets can be purchased through the tournament's official website. The cost of tickets for the Arnold Clark Cup ranges from £3.75 to £30 (excluding booking fees). As well as full-price adult tickets, concession tickets are available for fans under the age of 16, over 65 and students. There are also discounts on tickets when bought in groups of nine or more.

6959,"Houston Dash star Daly can offer England ‘important’ insight on Canada’s NWSL players, says Walsh","England midfielder Keira Walsh believes that international team-mate Rachel Daly’s insight into members of Canada’s squad is “important to hear” ahead of their Arnold Clark Cup clash. The two nations will meet on Thursday evening in Middlesbrough in each team’s first game of the inaugural tournament, which kicks off with Germany vs Spain earlier in the day. It’s a game that will see Daly, who plays her football with the Houston Dash in the NWSL, come up against three of her club-mates - Allysha Chapman, Sophie Schmidt and Nichelle Prince. Asked about Canada’s talent, Walsh told media on Tuesday: “I play with Janine Beckie at [Manchester] City and they're all a similar style. They're all very fast and very direct. “Rachel talks to us about some of the players she's played with and against in the NWSL and I think it's important for us to hear that and draw from her experiences of playing against them. “We imagine them to be quite direct, and they're all very quick and I think from seeing the girls in the WSL this year, Jessie Fleming had a great start to Chelsea and she's carried that on through the second half of the season. “Obviously, we have to respect the opposition, but for us, it's about focusing on what we're doing and sticking to the game plan in those games and just starting this tournament confidently and playing well as a team.” It’s not just some of Canada’s players that are well-known in the England camp. Head coach Bev Priestman was the Lionesses’ assistant coach before she took her current job in North America in 2020. Priestman led Canada to Olympic gold last summer, less than a year after being appointed. “A lot of the girls got on with Bev,” Walsh said of the 35-year-old. “She was a great person and a great person to have in and around the camp. “I think she’s very organised in defence and that’s something that she always prided the team on when she was here, and I imagine she does the same in Canada if you watch them play. They’re very good at pressing. They’re organised and tough to break down. “I think since Bev's been their manager, they probably play a little bit more and try and keep possession. I think, for us it's about focusing on what we've been doing in the World Cup qualifiers. ""Obviously, it's better opposition in these three games but I think it’s just trying to implement that against tougher teams and trying to see how we cope in the games. Hopefully, it will be a good experience for us all this week.” England’s second Arnold Clark Cup fixture will come on Sunday, when they take on an exciting Spain team that features 10 players from Barcelona, the reigning European champions. Walsh came up against that Barca team in last season’s Women’s Champions League campaign with Man City, losing the first leg 3-0 and winning the second 2-1. It was one of just three games the Catalans lost all term – in all competitions – but it wasn’t enough for City to stop them on their journey to the UWCL title. Asked if she could draw on the experiences of those two games when coming up against many of the same players at the weekend, Walsh said: “A lot of the Barcelona team is of the Spanish national team and I imagine that they do play a very similar style of play. “I think from the first game at City we probably gave them a little bit too much respect. I think we were probably a bit too apprehensive about how good they are on the ball. “I think that's something that we took into the second leg, especially with just being a bit more aggressive and on the front foot. Obviously, they're unbelievable at keeping the ball and playing possession. But I think for us, it was just about getting in their faces a little bit more. “I think all of us can draw on those experiences - Chelsea have played them before, and Arsenal, so we've got a lot of experience at club [of] playing against these players. Hopefully we can we can bring that into the game on Sunday.” Tickets to watch England, Germany, Spain and Canada play in the Arnold Clark Cup are available now.

6968,Laura Blindkilde Brown: England’s De Bruyne-inspired teen who overcame heart surgery,"For more on the world's best young ballers, follow NXGN on Instagram, Twitter and TikTok. “The feeling when I thought, ‘Oh, I might not be able to play’… That’s one of the worst feelings ever.” Laura Blindkilde Brown remembers vividly the moment she found out she might have to stop chasing her dream of being a professional footballer. After tests on the midfielder's noticeably fast heartbeat, she was diagnosed with a condition called supraventricular tachycardia, and was told that she may have to have a pacemaker fitted. If so, it would stop her enjoying the game she fell in love with as a young girl, influenced by her football-mad brothers and her dad, a coach. Fortunately, it wouldn’t come to that. Blindkilde Brown would need heart surgery, but that it was keyhole surgery meant her recovery was much quicker and, ultimately, meant she could return to the pitch, too. Fast-forward a few years and that setback has been part of the journey that has forged one of the most exciting young players in England, one set to star for the Young Lionesses at this month’s Women’s Under-19 European Championship after making her mark on Aston Villa’s first team this past season. It was a whirlwind of a campaign for the 18-year-old. After signing her first professional contract last September, she scored her first senior goal in December, signed a contract extension after Christmas that will take her to the summer of 2025, and was named the club’s Young Player of the Season. ""Laura’s been fantastic in training and in games,"" Villa head coach Carla Ward said after her strike against Sunderland late last year. ""We've had a lot of enquiries about her going on loan. We've considered it, but what she's doing out there is giving us a headache. “She's been sensational and she'll get better and better."" Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: It’s no wonder Ward has been impressed. When Blindkilde Brown gets on the ball, she makes things happen. She has that ability to control a game from a deeper role or, when pushed further forward, contribute with goals or assists that are decisive for her team. “I want to be more of an impact player,” the England youth international, who is also eligible for Denmark through her mother, tells GOAL. “As much as I want to assist, I also want to score goals and help the team win.” With that desire to be a gamechanger, it’s no surprise to hear who the player is that she’d “want to be like”, then. “I've always liked watching Kevin De Bruyne play,” she adds. “The way he assists but also scores… I just think he's such a good player.” It was with Villa that Blindkilde Brown started the path that has got her to this point. Spotted at school by a coach who worked for the club, she was soon on trial with the U9s and, despite believing that no one “expected” her to get in, she did. “[The coach] just thought I had something and decided to take me on,” she remembers. He was right – and now, 10 years later, the first team is reaping the rewards. After a brief stint with city rivals Birmingham, where she made her senior debut at the age of 16, Blindkilde Brown excelled with the Villa academy upon her return to earn opportunities under Ward. It has been surreal to get those chances, too. She has played alongside England icon Jill Scott, a player she used to watch growing up, and against someone she has “always looked up to”, too, in Arsenal midfielder Kim Little. “To have more regular game time and just play against some of the best players, it's helped me a lot,” she explains. “I think it's helped tactically more than anything, and to have players alongside me who are giving me information. “This year, my out of possession [work] has probably [developed the most] because some of the teams we played against, they've had so much of the ball and it's so tactically different than it was at the academy. You have to read people's movements.” It’s not only Villa that are benefiting from Blindkilde Brown’s continued improvement. Brought into a youth team camp by England when she was just 13, the midfielder has been a fixture ever since and starred earlier this year as the U19s qualified for the summer’s Euros. “Once you're just standing there wearing an England shirt, it's really surreal,” she says, recalling her first game for the country. “To think this is what you've done... You've got yourself there… It's crazy.” It’s something she and her whole family is proud of – even if many of them would like her to be wearing a different shirt during the international breaks. Denmark’s Football Association has been in touch about her representing the country she visits every year before summer and every other year at Christmas - but the teenager’s ambition is to play for England at senior level. She has made a change to represent that side of her family, though, switching the name on the back of her shirt from ‘Brown’ to ‘Blindkilde’. “I like the name a lot,” she laughs. “But also my Danish family don't get to see me play football a lot, not as much my English family do, so almost having it on the back of my shirt was something that they could have as part of me in football as well.” With Denmark not at the U19 Euros this month, at least there will be no split loyalties in the family as the Young Lionesses aim to do what the seniors are also targeting next month and triumph. “We want to be one of the first age groups that's actually won the Euros,” Blindkilde Brown says, ending the conversation with GOAL by outlining the short and long-term goals she has. Playing in the Champions League is one for further down the line, as well as being a full international. With the ability this 18-year-old has, it’s all possible.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/laura-blindkilde-brown-england-de-bruyne-heart-surgery/bltd38a1df541f0021e,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

6981,How does Chelsea star Fran Kirby fit into Sarina Wiegman’s England?,"In England’s opening game of the Arnold Clark Cup, the first-half performance had fans so excited, it prompted some to dream about winning this summer’s European Championship. Facing Olympic gold medallists Canada, this was the Lionesses’ first real test under new head coach Sarina Wiegman. Since her arrival in September, the team had won all six of their World Cup qualifying games, scoring 53 goals, conceding none. Consequently, it's been difficult to make any definitive judgements on Wiegman’s tenure to date, or gauge the level of this team before England hosts the Euros later this year. The first 45 minutes against Canada showed how thrilling they can be against elite opposition, though. Manchester City winger Lauren Hemp was electric out wide. Manchester United’s Alessia Russo was dynamic in the centre forward position. Arsenal’s Leah Williamson, usually a centre-back, provided energy and a goal-scoring threat in a box-to-box midfield role, while the full-backs bombed on. However, for all England's impressive attacking play, one player was surprisingly uninvolved: Fran Kirby. The Chelsea star must be one of the players in this side that opponents fear most. For her club, she is given a huge amount of freedom, roaming with intent in whatever spaces she can find, be those out wide or more central. In that role, she is absolutely sensational. She was the best player in the Women’s Super League all last season, forming a wonderful partnership with Sam Kerr to lead the Blues to the title, as well as Continental Cup glory, an FA Cup triumph and the Women’s Champions League final. In all competitions in 2021, she scored 30 goals and registered 25 assists. For England, though, it’s difficult to know where she fits in. On Thursday, she was played as a right winger but struggled to get involved. She’s played regularly as a central midfielder too. The latter is fine against lower-ranked nations where she doesn’t have to spend as much time honouring her defensive duties, as she can get out of the crowded areas and find the spaces. Against better teams, though, she is restricted. “I've had some really good conversations with Sarina,” Kirby said in November. “We're both on the same page in the way that we want to play football. We want to keep the ball. We want to keep possession. Chelsea's Fran Kirby has been named Football Writers' Association Women's Footballer of the Year 🏆 pic.twitter.com/bPHPH3eKYG “My position is a bit different at England than it is at Chelsea. I'm expected at England to be more in the midfield area, rather than being higher up the pitch, which is a difference. ""But it's one that I'm learning and I'm trying to understand, trying to do my role better, working on my defensive role. “I think it's difficult, because I link up so well with Sam [Kerr at Chelsea] and I do try and play the same way. ""But obviously, playing in a different position, it's tough to do the things that I would do at Chelsea at England.” Blues manager Emma Hayes has often talked about England needing to find the right “formula” with Kirby, in terms of managing her load and not over-playing her. However, the national team hasn’t found the right formula in terms of her playing position, either. “I haven't made up my mind yet and this is not the time. I don't have to make up my mind yet,” Wiegman said of Kirby's best position after the Canada game. “We are trying out those things so, today, she started as a right winger. ""Of course, I've known her for a long time as an opponent. She used to play as a 10 and later on, she started playing a role at Chelsea too as a striker. I think she's just a little bit in between, so she can play both. “Of course, she needs to perform well and then we can see what would be the best for the team.” Wiegman has repeatedly talked about trying out different things during the Arnold Clark Cup. The double-pivot of Williamson and Keira Walsh has been one of the main things she picked out as something she wants to see more of. Getting the best out of Kirby should be another. After all, the forward is a player who can win matches on her own. Is there a way to give her a freer role in this team without disrupting the system that Wiegman wants to play? Is there a position in Wiegman’s system that she could operate better in? If England can unleash a version of the Chelsea star that is seen every week at club level, it could help take this team to another level. Then, fans could certainly start getting excited about the potential to win major tournaments.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-fran-kirby-fit-sarina-wiegman-england/bltf2e1fa4b54036cc9,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7016,'All of US: The U.S. Women's Soccer Show' previews USWNT vs Uzbekistan,"The U.S. women's national team is back in action this month and, on this week's episode of All of US: The U.S. Women's Soccer Show, GOAL breaks down everything you need to know ahead of two games with Uzbekistan. Vlatko Andonovski's side faces the Asian nation on April 9 and April 12, the first game in Columbus, Ohio, and the second in Chester, Pennsylvania. The world champions were last in action in February, winning the 2022 SheBelieves Cup after 5-0 victories over New Zealand and Iceland followed a goalless draw with the Czech Republic. Star names such as Alex Morgan, Christen Press and Tobin Heath remain absent from the roster this month, but there is plenty of young talent to get excited about in their absence. You can find All of US simply by searching for it on your preferred podcast platform, be that Spotify, Apple, or something else. As well as this week's episode, listeners can go back and catch plenty of content around the USWNT. Catarina Macario and Naomi Girma will both be involved in this month's friendlies against Uzbekistan, and both are previous guests on the show. Macario joined GOAL to discuss her decision to play for the U.S. over her country of birth, Brazil, as well as to give some insight into what it is like playing for seven-time European champions Lyon, the club she signed for last January after forgoing her senior season at Stanford. Girma, meanwhile, could win her first cap for the USWNT in this international break. The centre-back was the No.1 pick in the 2022 NWSL Draft and has started all three of the San Diego Wave's Challenge Cup games so far this season. She told GOAL all about learning from fellow defender Abby Dahlkemper and head coach Casey Stoney, who was a star for England in the same position in her playing days. A number of veterans are missing from Andonovski's roster this month, some due to injury - such as captain Becky Sauerbrunn - and some due to the coach wanting to see what the next generation has to offer, with players such as Morgan and Heath not involved since October 2021. In that next generation are players like Trinity Rodman, the 19-year-old forward who took the NWSL by storm last year, leading the Washington Spirit to an unprecedented Championship win. Rodman is one of nine players on the roster with less than 10 caps to their name, with three of those - including Girma - uncapped. In fact, only seven players called up have more than 50 appearances for their country. GOAL discusses this youthful group on the latest episode of All of US, while also explaining why the U.S. is playing Uzbekistan and picking out who will be the players to watch in these upcoming fixtures.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/all-of-us-us-womens-soccer-preview-uswnt-vs-uzbekistan/bltd5c5b9920e114a2e,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7031,The artists using football to tackle mental health,"2022 marks the year of the UEFA Women's Euro and the FIFA Men’s World Cup. All this week, VICE and GOAL will be collaborating to publish insightful, interesting stories from the world of football and fan culture, introducing VICE fans to GOAL and GOAL fans to VICE. “We should talk about our feelings,” isn’t the kind of sentiment you usually find in football grounds. The chants, flags and hurled expletives of the terraces and stands usually have more to do with kicking rival fans' heads in than dealing with emotions. But it is the kind of sentiment you find in the work of the artist Corbin Shaw. He’s hand-stitched those words onto a football flag, alongside St George’s Crosses emblazoned with phrases like ‘Soften Up Hard Lad’ and ‘Sweet & Tender Hooligan’. And he’s not alone; just one of a growing number of young artists working today who use football as a way of confronting the stigmas around mental health, sexuality and violence that are pervasive in British culture. Shaw grew up deeply embedded in the world of football; a childhood fan following in his dad’s footsteps. But as he got older, he realised that something wasn’t quite right, that men didn’t talk about their feelings, that crying wasn’t ok, that violence was accepted. Football is the visual language he uses to subvert that. The story is the same with most of the young artists using football in their art today. JJ Guest grew up in a similar way to Shaw, supporting a team and playing the game but realising that he never quite fit in. “I look back and realise that most ideas that I have of masculinity and what it means to be a man all stem from football culture in some way,” he says. “I’d study the players and teams obsessively so that my friends wouldn’t discover that I was an imposter and in turn learn that I was queer too. ""Singing the songs and wearing the scarves gave me a sense of protection before I even understood what it was that I needed protecting from.” His work glories in the hidden, implied, silent sexual tension of the game. He creates sculptures of famous players locked in passionate embraces, goal nets with the word ‘man on’, a pair of beautiful bone china balls hung in a taught net. His Instagram account is a celebration of the sweaty, muscular hotness of the modern male football star. “I’m ultimately trying to hijack the imagery and language of football to force people to consider why they hold the views that they do,” he says. “If you can celebrate two players kissing when they’ve just scored the winning goal, then you can at least tolerate two men holding hands on their way home.” Trackie McLeod is a Scottish artist who also grew up surrounded by football without ever feeling like he really fit in. It’s a sentiment he expresses perfectly in his football shirt works: a red shirt with ‘Big Girl’s Blouse’ across the back, a blue one that says ‘Shirt Lifter’. They’re obvious, direct works of art, intended to “reclaim words that are used to de-masculinise and devalue men, particularly within heteronomrative environments,” he says. Another work features twin Celtic and Rangers shirts, each pointing at each other and saying ‘I’m with stupid’. The piece is about “taking the piss out of being in that hazy middleground between two conflicting teams and not being arsed about either of them,” he says. Brilliantly, the work’s title is ‘Did This Artwork Just Solve Sectarianism?’ Playful, aggressive, silly, and serious in equal measure. Alice May Williams – who grew up supporting Liverpool – is similarly subversive in her approach to football. For a show about anxiety at the Science Gallery in 2019, Williams created paintings out of phrases like ‘with you’ and ‘if you need’ – the sort of things players say to each other on the pitch in the heat of the game, offering support but never really realising how kind those words really are. “I try to always make my work express something outside the mainstream, but in a gentle way, rather than a confrontational way,” she says. “Sometimes, you have to learn to blend in so you can actually stand out and speak up against the oppressive environment you are illustrating. You have to lull your audience into a sense of security before you can introduce topics they might find challenging or against their sensibilities.” For the most part, these artists feel like they didn’t necessarily fit in with football culture growing up – their gender, queerness or interests made them perpetual outsiders, that’s why they use it in their art. Sheffield-based painter Conor Rogers, on the other hand, was all in. He grew up in a Sheffield United-obsessed household – his grandfather is Brian the Blade, a big character famed for his rants on BBC Radio Sheffield – and he played the game to a high level in his youth. “Football has always had its influence on me from the day I was born,” he says. “I use it in my art because of its cultural significance, it has a tremendous number of possibilities to be used as a tool to interpret the world around us. ""Its role is to be a method of translating my personal lived experiences whilst navigating the wider connections to our communities, behaviours, histories, folklore, our sense of belonging and even the societal language of the game.” His work is made up of stunningly ultra-detailed, photo-realistic paintings on unusual materials, including a series of portraits of emotionally-wrought football managers on discarded betting slips, with the Ladbrokes logo vandalised to say ‘LAD R U OK?’ The figures in his art are often filled with the sadness of defeat, the heartache of relegation, or the joy of victory. “I am using football as a form of social commentary, the language of its culture can be harnessed to expose us to what makes us who we are. ""It reveals identities and stories, heightens our understanding of our shared connections and disconnections, I want to defiantly re-address stereotypes with sincerity and openness.” It’s worth acknowledging that the artists dealing with football in this specific way are, for the most part, white and male. That’s largely because these are artists working with ideas borne out of growing up in majority white, working class areas and cultures. There are tons of amazing, fascinating non-white artists using football in their work, but there’s a specific link between these artists. Throughout the work here, football is used to tackle big ideas out in wider society; a vehicle for sneaking out critical thinking. But it can also be used as a hook for getting football fans interested in art. “I am trying to use football to connect with a wider audience, to introduce football fans to art and vice versa. I hate contemporary art that is designed to exclude people through obtuse meaning, or by requiring a certain level of prior knowledge or experience to “get” the work,” says Alice May Williams. And that’s important, because by hooking people in with football, you can more easily get your ideas out there, and these artists all have something to say. “The statistical links between football results/games and domestic abuse, racially motivated violence, anti-queer violence etc, make it even more important for us to challenge the ways in which football informs and constructs masculine identities, and how men process emotion,” is how JJ Guest puts it. These are artists using football to do something special – to talk about our feelings.

7065,"USWNT boss Andonovski urges Morgan, Rapinoe & other vets to step up after SheBelieves Cup omission","U.S. women's national team head coach Vlatko Andonovski has urged veteran stars like Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe to step up their performances after they were omitted from the roster for the 2022 SheBelieves Cup. Andonovski named his squad for the upcoming tournament on Thursday, prioritizing a number of less experienced players as he continues to evaluate his player pool ahead of the 2023 World Cup. The U.S. boss showed sentimentality would not enter his thought process heading toward next summer's World Cup, grouping his veteran stars in with long-retired USWNT legends Mia Hamm and Julie Foudy. Andonovski was asked on a conference call about the omission of Morgan, Rapinoe, Christen Press and Tobin Heath, to which he responded: ""All these players are very good players. We all know that. They've done so much for this team, and they've won everything possible.  ""But right now in these camps, I felt like I want to give a chance to players like Sophie Smith and Mal Pugh and Catarina Macario, Ashley Hatch. ""In any of these camps, like SheBelieves for example, we call in any of the senior players then we're not going to be able to see the younger ones, or dial in as deep as we want with the younger ones. “It doesn't mean that all these players that have done well in the past, they're just going to come back here in the next camp because they've done well a year ago, or two years ago.  ""There's a reason why Mia Hamm is not in camp still. We're not calling Mia Hamm or Julie Foudy in camp right? So the same goes here. They need to perform. They need to play in their markets. They need to play well in their markets, and show that they can still contribute and be valuable for the national team.” The USWNT will take on Czech Republic, New Zealand and Iceland in the four-team tournament, which kicks off on February 17. Andonovski's team will face the Czechs on February 17 at Dignity Health Sports Park near Los Angeles to kick off the tournament, and will play New Zealand on February 20 at the same venue. The U.S. will conclude the tournament on February 23 against Iceland at Toyota Stadium near Dallas.

7102,Macario announces herself as USWNT star as wonder goals down Iceland to clinch SheBelieves Cup,"Catarina Macario has shown flashes of her ability with the U.S. women’s national team since her debut in January 2021, but Wednesday may be remembered as the night she announced herself as a real star. The 22-year-old scored not one, but two jaw-dropping goals in the first half against Iceland, and assisted another as the USWNT clinched the SheBelieves Cup with a 5-0 win in Frisco, Texas. The goals were not her first with the national team, nor were they even her first golazos (a half-volley against Paraguay last fall certainly fits into that category) but Wednesday night felt different. Part of it was the context of generational change the SheBelieves Cup represented. Head coach Vlatko Andonovski opted to omit veteran attacking stars such as Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan in order to give some of his youthful forwards a chance. Whereas Macario had always shared the field with established stars with the USWNT, this tournament saw her start all three matches alongside equally youthful players also looking to make their case. And whereas Macario started her USWNT career with no professional experience, she is now a key player for European powerhouse Lyon. Her confidence is growing quickly, and on Wednesday it appeared to be increasing by the minute. After Macario’s first goal, a stunning curler from outside that box that rang off the far post and in, she had the audacity to attempt a far-post chip with her first touch while running away from the goal. It was a shot few would’ve tried, and even fewer would’ve scored. Macario did. FROM THE CORNER OF THE BOX!!!!Get in, @catarinamacario 🇺🇸#SheBelievesCup x @Visa pic.twitter.com/TMSZ5h62EE No. 2 for @catarinamacario 😼#SheBelievesCup x @Visa pic.twitter.com/XxxlAeQkIg ""Cat is a special player,"" Andonovski said after the game. ""She is a player with special qualities and obviously she scored two world-class goals. Goals like that should be on highlights reels all over the world."" Macario is proving that she belongs on the field for the USWNT, but where – and at whose expense – is a question that Andonovski will be forced to reckon with. The SheBelieves Cup saw Macario deployed at the No.9 position, where she played more of a false nine at times as she dropped deep to find the ball. She has also played as a wide forward and as part of the USWNT’s midfield trio in its preferred 4-3-3 setup. Mallory Pugh, who also scored a pair of goals on the night, was impressed with Macario's ability to play as a target forward. ""I've never played with Cat as the nine and I think this tournament she really did such a great job,"" Pugh said. ""I think that we needed to see and learn what her tendencies are. For her it's to come back, control it, turn and play-make off of her."" Andonovski will have to decide how and if he wants to redeploy his veteran stars, and where the likes of Macario and other young forwards who’ve impressed at the SheBelieves Cup, like Pugh, Sophia Smith and others, will fit in. But the more Macario performs like she did on Wednesday, the more Andonovski’s question will be where, not if, she starts on the field. As the USWNT coach said: ""She slowly but surely has become a total footballer.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/macario-announces-herself-uswnt-iceland-shebelieves-cup/blt0a047683acb75665,By Seth Vertelney,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7103,‘I didn’t even know Jill Ellis knew who I was!’ – USWNT & Washington Spirit forward Ashley Hatch recalls debut,"Washington Spirit forward Ashley Hatch has recalled the disbelief around her first U.S. women’s national team call-up, admitting that she did not even think then-head coach Jill Ellis had any idea who she was before she was brought into camp. The 26-year-old made her debut for her country six years ago, and got another appearance under her belt in 2018, but her third would not come until late in 2021, after she finished as the top goalscorer in the NWSL and helped fire the Spirit to an unlikely Championship. Hatch also revealed the mystery around the Golden Boot from her tremendous season, which ended with her scoring her first goal for the U.S. just 24 seconds into her first start. Speaking to GOAL on the latest episode of All of US: The U.S. Women’s Soccer Show, Hatch discussed the different feelings she experienced on her debut in 2016 and then on her return to the national team after several years away in 2021, which saw her score after less than a minute against Australia. “My first cap, I didn't even know I was even on the U.S. national team's radar,” she said. “When Jill Ellis called my coach, I was, like, 'I didn’t even know Jill Ellis knew who I was!' “Then to be able to have my debut in Utah, where I went to school, and have my family and team-mates there was a really unique experience and one that I couldn't have written better myself. “But then the Australia experience, being able to have my first start, first goal, that was just like a lot of hard work finally paying off. It was very rewarding. ""So I feel like it's hard to compare those two but if I had to rank them, I feel like getting my first start, first goal, is a little bit higher.” Hatch also reflected on a crazy 2021 season for the Washington Spirit. Head coach Richie Burke was ""terminated for cause"" after an NWSL investigation in September, while a public battle for control of the club was also going on. However, the team managed to overcome these obstacles to produce something truly special on the pitch, charging all the way to NWSL Championship glory in November. Hatch’s contributions were crucial, as she scored 11 goals in 23 games to win the NWSL Golden Boot. When GOAL asked where her accolade was though, the striker said: “That's a great question - I wish I had it in here and I could just get it and show it to you. “I had it at the Championship game. They had my Golden Boot and Aubrey [Kingsbury's] Golden Glove. We celebrated with it and took pictures and stuff, and then the NWSL took it away from me because they said they're going to put my name on it and I haven't seen it since, so I should probably actually inquire about that and be like, 'Where's my Golden Boot?!' So I've only actually seen it twice!” You can find All of US simply by searching for it on your preferred podcast platform, be that Spotify, Apple, or something else.

7119,'Queens of the Pitch' - Why Barcelona's new TV series is a potential game-changer for women's football,"When FC Barcelona were filming the first edition of ‘Matchday’, its behind-the-scenes docuseries, it almost ended in spectacular fashion. Ernesto Valverde’s side had wrapped up the league title early, were in the final of the Copa del Rey and 3-0 up from the first leg of their Champions League semi-final tie with Liverpool. However, an infamous collapse at Anfield and a surprise loss to Valencia scuppered hopes of the documentary becoming the story of an extraordinary treble-winning season. “We were three games away from having probably the best football insider ever, and not because we were producing it, but because of the participation of the players,” Paco Latorre, director of Barca Studios, tells GOAL. “We really had Lionel Messi on board, Gerard Pique on board, Luis Suarez on board, Sergio Busquets on board, Jordi Alba on board, Marc-Andre ter Stegen on board and one thing that is very important in this kind of content is that the protagonists make it their story.” Take two, however, ended perfectly. Following the club’s women’s team throughout the 2020-21 season, Latorre and Barca Studios belatedly landed their treble. Lluis Cortes’ team lost just one game on their way to the league title, beat Chelsea 4-0 in the Champions League final and came out on top in a six-goal thriller with Levante in the Copa de la Reina. “We said they should record documentaries every year if they end like that!” Alexia Putellas, who won the Ballon d’Or for her efforts in Barca’s historic season, tells GOAL. “Let them come all the time!” ‘Matchday: Queens of the Pitch’, which premiered on Barca TV on February 25, is a rarity in being a docuseries on a women’s football team. It featured an all-female shooting crew and wasn’t something Barcelona consciously chose to do – it was simply a “very natural” next step after the first series. It is naturally very different to its predecessor, too. “You can imagine it's not the same dealing with Messi or dealing with Alexia,” Latorre explains. “Dealing with Pique or dealing with Jenni [Hermoso]. They were much easier to deal with. “Someone like Messi, someone like Suarez, someone like Pique, you can imagine they've been in the spotlight for what, 15 years now?” he adds. “They are too used to the cameras. The girls, they were much more authentic, original, natural. That was a big bonus.” The idea of the club being one of the first to do this with its women’s team follows a theme it stands for, too. “It’s important, this line of being pioneers, having visions and sticking to them,” Latorre says. When Barca made its women’s team fully professional in 2015, it was not the first, but it was several years ahead of many other clubs. The commitment it has shown to the side in the past 10 years, too, has been exemplary and has started to bear fruit in recent seasons. Barcelona Femeni go another game 𝗨𝗡𝗗𝗘𝗙𝗘𝗔𝗧𝗘𝗗 🔥 pic.twitter.com/wjUpZY6MiO This success would not have come without the team’s pioneers, to whom the series pays tribute. The first women’s game at Camp Nou came back in 1970 and that is one of the first topics touched upon in the series. The stories of Melanie Serrano, the 32-year-old defender who has spent her whole career at Barca, and Vicky Losada, captain of the treble-winning team who had three spells with the club before leaving last summer, are showcased, too. ""It’s where we come from. She’s a player we can only thank for paving the way,” 24-year-old midfielder Aitana Bonmati says of Serrano in the first episode of the show. ""Without players like her, we wouldn’t be where we are now."" Also featured in that same episode is one of the few setbacks that Barca experienced last season – the Spanish Super Cup defeat to Atletico Madrid. That the documentary begins in disappointment but ends in success is something that Putellas believes “says a lot about the team we are”. Throughout that journey, in this rare look inside an elite women’s football team, there are two main things that stand out. “One is commitment, dedication,” Latorre says. “I think that's something that many people still don't realise when talking about women's football – how committed, how dedicated, how professional, how focused these girls are. “There is still so much, sometimes, disrespect in thinking that this is just a bunch of girls who meet and then they call each other almost for Sunday's game. It's not the case. Here you see proper professionalism.” The other is what he describes as “the secret of success” – that this team is a family. “You see that we're a really connected team,” Barca winger Lieke Martens tells GOAL. “That we really help each other. That not everyone had a really good season. “For example, one of the girls had an ACL injury. It wasn't easy, but we tried to help her off the pitch. She felt really connected. It's not easy when you're not with the team, but she still felt connected. “I think you'll see we had something special on the pitch last season, but also off the pitch.” “You see it in that episode with Vicki and Emma,” Latorre adds, referring to Losada sharing a touching moment with her partner, former Arsenal goalkeeper Emma Byrne, in the stands after the UWCL final triumph. “It's like a family enjoying together a very, very sweet moment. I think that's the secret of the success of the team and also something that we tried to portray. ""That's also part of our success in the production in really conveying this spirit.” Women’s football isn’t necessarily a regular feature of television or film, particularly when it comes to documentaries. ‘Queens of the Pitch’ is a rare example of a production that gives the audience the real insight into what it means to be an elite female athlete. Why doesn’t more of this exist? That’s another question altogether, but it would be fitting should Barca prove to be pioneers again.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-new-series-women-football-something-rare/blt718f96a96bc0e8ec,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7142,"USWNT prospect Girma opens up on being the top NWSL pick, training against Alex Morgan, and her Ethiopian roots","U.S. women's national team prospect and top NWSL draft pick Naomi Girma has spoken to GOAL about her experience with the expansion San Diego Wave, training against Alex Morgan and her Ethiopian-American upbringing, among other topics. Girma was selected first overall by the Wave in the 2022 NWSL Draft out of Stanford University, and is now getting set to embark on her first professional season. The 21-year-old center back, who was named the 2020 U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year, has starred for the USWNT at various youth levels, and has been called into camp with the senior team on two occasions. Girma is expected to feature heavily for the Wave, who will enter the league in 2022 along with Southern California rivals Angel City FC. ""I think [joining an expansion team] makes it easier being a rookie, because I'm not going into a team where everything's already set and I can help with the beginnings and figuring out how we want things to work and how we want the culture to be,"" Girma said on All of US: The U.S. Women's Soccer Show. The Wave have brought ex-Manchester United boss Casey Stoney in as head coach, and Girma has enjoyed working under the former England international defender. ""She's very personable as a coach and really wants to emphasize she's here to support us on or off the field, and wants to build relationships with us as people as well,"" Girma said of Stoney. ""She'll be like, 'OK, center backs come with me after training' and we'll do a little extra work on something like defending in the box or like, really small details that you don't always get from coaches if they don't have such expertise in that position."" Girma also spoke about training against USWNT star Alex Morgan, one of the Wave's biggest acquisitions ahead of their inaugural season. ""I think it's teaching me [to] play faster, or there are certain things that maybe you can do in college, but you can't do at the pro level. ""The level is higher, the players are better and playing against one of the top players in the world every day – I feel extremely blessed and grateful that I have this opportunity."" Girma was born and raised in San Jose, California, and both of her parents emigrated to the U.S. from Ethiopia. She spoke about how this dual upbring influenced her. ""At home... it was a lot of Ethiopian culture and then going to school, [it was] a lot of the American culture. That dual upbringing was definitely interesting and something I had to navigate when I was younger, but I'm really thankful I had that experience now,"" Girma said. ""It's shaped me as a person, my values and the emphasis on community and support. That's a big thing in Ethiopian culture and it's something that I highly value.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uswnt-prospect-girma-top-nwsl-pick-alex-morgan-ethiopian/blt30739ac4f0be57ce,Seth Vertelney,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7151,'I was starstruck by USWNT ace Sauerbrunn' – Rashida Beal's arduous path from NWSL to UWCL,"For female soccer players in the U.S. college system, the NWSL is almost like the promised land. The only professional women’s league in a country that has won more Women’s World Cup titles than anyone else, it is home to some of the best players in the world. However, with just 12 teams, getting a contract isn’t easy. When Rashida Beal was drafted into the NWSL by FC Kansas City back in 2017, as pick No.35, her attitude was “pretty realistic”. Among the stars of the Kansas City team she was to join were Becky Sauerbrunn, now the U.S. women's national team captain, and Desiree Scott, an Olympic gold medallist this past summer with Canada. “It was really intimidating,” she tells GOAL. “Looking back, I definitely got in my own head about it because by my senior year [in college], I felt very comfortable. “And then I walk in there, where [there's] Sydney Leroux, Becky Sauerbrunn, Yael Averbuch – really talented, really well-known players and that was definitely intimidating.” Beal didn’t make the roster, which was only big enough for 20 players at that time, but was kept as a reserve player and would train along those big names for an incredibly valuable experience. “Becky Sauerbrunn still is one of my favourite players to watch,” she says. “Just the composure she has in that center-back position was something I really looked up to. “In general, the defenders on that team were very technically gifted and that is not my strong suit, so I was like, 'Wow, this is crazy!' “Seeing players like Becky and Yael with that technical composure in the center-back position was really impressive and I was a little starstruck, for sure.” It wasn’t just the defenders that helped Beal learn, either. “At that time, Sydney Leroux was only about six months out of her first pregnancy,” she recalls. “She was working back and was someone that was very helpful and encouraging, giving me tips and advice. Obviously, if I'm going against her in practice, she has things to say. “Becca Moros, who's now coaching, she was really helpful, helping me do extra work and things like that. ""There was no shortage of experienced players that were willing to help, give advice and give feedback. That was one of the best things about the environment.” Beal’s plan was to look for an overseas move, to improve her game in another way. “But I had many different life events that kind of threw that off course,” she explains. Tendinitis developed in her left knee in her senior year of college, which got much worse while she was pushing to impress in Kansas and led to a partial tear in her patellar tendon. After building her way back for six months, she would then tear three ligaments in her knee after a tackle during a training session. “I cried at almost every doctor's appointment because I was like, 'Maybe I can do this now!' And [I was told], 'No, you're not ready,'"" Beal remembers. “That was a very long process. I didn't jog for five months. I didn't sprint for probably seven. I got cleared at 10 months, but I still had six weeks of return to sport protocol. “Essentially, it was nearly a year before I was playing again and then I actually think almost right when I got cleared is when I re-tore my meniscus – but it wasn't confirmed for a while.” That was another setback and had it not been just a trim of the ligament that was needed in her second surgery, she says she would have been “done”. But she isn’t done. After getting over obstacle after obstacle, Beal’s path has taken her into the Women’s Champions League with Olimpia Cluj, the Romanian champions. After going through some real mental battles to get to this point, there is one question that GOAL has to ask: what pushes her not to give up? “For one, that's just never been my personality,” Beal says. “I have a few things that I'm really passionate about and nothing can get in the way of them. “I also went through moments of very difficult challenges, especially my freshman year in college, and it's just never been in my DNA to give up – not even to give up easily, but to give up at all. “I just felt I couldn't stop playing until I did what I wanted, what I set out to do. Right now, my sights are no longer on NWSL. That's just not where my goals are. ""But playing professionally was still one of them and so I just felt unfinished. “Then another thing is, you may have heard people talk about, ‘What's your why?’ You kind of have to have something deeper pushing you and I think a big thing is my younger brother. “That's why I left Kansas City, because my younger brother had gotten into a fatal motorcycle accident. It was not immediate. He was in the hospital. My parents had to take him off life support. “It was very traumatic and at his memorial, his friends came up to me and were like: 'Oh my gosh, he was so proud of you. You were in Kansas City playing with this professional team. He told everybody you were a professional player.' “That's my why. It's a little bit bigger than that. I know that he would be like: 'Oh, you can't quit'.” With that incredible force driving her, Beal’s European adventure continues to propel her towards goals that have changed a little from when she was younger. “I've thought a bit about, 'Well, what's in my control?'” she explains. “I want to be in a competitive environment with good resources and enjoy it. ""I obviously want to play at the highest level that I can. I don't know exactly what that is, where that is. ""So, I'm trying not to focus too much on those kinds of things and just focus more on continuing to improve as a player. “Just reaching my max potential, I guess, is as simple as it is.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/starstruck-uswnt-captain-sauerbrunn-rashida-beal-nwsl/blt8979e8913714e641,Amee Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

7166,'Dare to be unique' - Sweden veteran Lindahl touts encouraging culture shift for Women's Euro 2022,"Sweden star Hedvig Lindahl says she has noticed a positive culture change with her country heading into the Women's Euro 2022. Sweden are looking to claim their first major international title since 1984 when they compete in this year's summer tournament. The Nordic nation are largely viewed as one of the top teams in women's football despite their lack of trophies, but Lindahl believes this generation of players has something special compared to previous teams. Specifically, the 39-year-old goalkeeper, who made her debut 20 years ago, feels the atmosphere in the team has changed drastically. She told BBC Sport: ""I think every player - from the last to join the team to the ones who have been there the longest - feels the same way, that you are safe to have an opinion. ""What is special about this group is that if you stop an exercise on the training field, you will hear a chatter of different voices. You are safe together and can dare to be unique within the team and, in that way, we get the best out of everyone since everyone contributes with their viewpoint. ""I've played during a few years where I didn't always dare to say what I thought and for me it's important to contribute to an environment where everyone feels that security."" She added: ""It would be very nice if people could just play football and that was it, if there wasn't anything to fight for, but that's not the case. ""It makes you realise that if I want it to be better for the next generation or for myself while I play, then I have to say something."" The Atletico Madrid star cited 2013 as a pivotal year for women's football in Sweden. The Scandinavian country made it to the 2003 World Cup final and lost to Germany, but it was not until they hosted the European Championship 10 years later that the public started to appreciate the women's game. Lindahl said: ""In 2003, there were almost four million that watched the World Cup final and when we came home there was an incredible celebration. It was like: 'Wow, finally'… but then you didn't see any bigger effect. Nothing happened until 2013. ""It was almost as if there was a paradigm shift. If you were a women's football fan in Sweden before 2013, it was as if you had to be ashamed of it. People could tweet that it was like cows running on a field; they thought that was a funny joke. But after that summer, if anyone made that joke there would be uproar. ""It became a lot more acceptable to be a fan of women's football.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/sweden-veteran-lindahl-recognises-encouraging-culture-shift/blt1bfdc1d1a62ea25c,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7177,‘I don't recognise that I'm 20!’ – Is Germany’s Lena Oberdorf the best player at the Women’s Euros?,"It was 15 minutes into Germany’s Women’s Euros quarter-final and the eight-time champions found themselves on the back foot. Austria had already spurned a good chance one-on-one and then hit the post. Their opponents, the favourites to progress, needed to regain control. Shortly after the woodwork had kept the scores level, Austria striker Nicole Billa picked the ball up on the left wing in a good position, ready to start a new attack.  However, Lena Oberdorf, Germany’s 20-year-old defensive midfielder, came flying in, winning the ball and a throw-in with a thunderous challenge. She jumped up, shouted in celebration and banged the badge on her chest. In the minutes that followed, Germany started to turn the screw and Oberdorf was key in that, winning several tackles that would set her team on the attack, drawing clever fouls to slow the game down and nullifying Austria’s flurries forward. Such interventions weren’t as eye-catching as the flying challenge on Billa, but they were constant throughout an incredible performance that would be absolutely crucial to Germany’s 2-0 victory. “I’m pleased she plays for Germany,” said head coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg afterwards, “and not someone else.” “I think it’s always Obi against me,” laughed Sarah Zadrazil, the Austria midfielder who is used to facing her for Bayern Munich, when playing title rivals Wolfsburg.  “It was a good battle. She's a great player with a lot of qualities and she's still young, so props to her, she played an amazing game. “Hopefully, Germany can go all the way because I'm super-close friends with some of them. Today, I wasn't their fan, but I will be in the future games.”  With Oberdorf, they have a great chance, anyway. It was back in 2018 that the name of this wonderfully talented youngster started to really gain some traction.  After playing with the boys’ teams at TSG Sprockhovel, she joined SGS Essen in the Frauen-Bundesliga and established herself as a key player in a variety of positions – centre-back, central midfield and even out wide. Her maturity, versatility and tactical awareness all shone from day one, earning her a national team debut in early 2019, at the age of 17, and a place in Voss-Tecklenburg’s World Cup squad that summer.  In 2020, she was the obvious choice for GOAL’s NXGN award. Since then, she’s signed for a huge club in two-time European champions Wolfsburg and her role there and with her country has become integral.  Settling into a defensive midfield position for both, you’d be hard-tasked in finding a player that does it better than Oberdorf. The way she reads play, breaks down attacks and protects the back line is beyond her years. “I think everyone saw what Lena Oberdorf can do,” her national team coach said after her dominant display against Austria. “She shows maturity, a joy for playing, she fought balls and worked hard at the back. She rubbed off onto her team-mates and had great moments offensively. “She played an incredibly great game and I’m very happy for her. She is still in her early 20s and [played] such a mature performance. I think she has proved that she has a great future.” “I don't recognise that I'm 20,” Oberdorf said earlier in the tournament, speaking after she had put in a superb display in the 4-0 win over Denmark that kicked off Germany’s tournament.  “I feel like when I'm on the pitch, everybody sees me as like a 28-year-old player. “I just forget about my age, just play, just have fun, just get into the duels because that's what I can do the best.” For all the stars in this Germany squad – from a legend like Alex Popp, who became the first player to score in four consecutive Euros appearances in a single edition last time out, to goalkeeper Merle Frohms, whose case for being one of the best goalkeepers in the world has only strengthened in this tournament – Oberdorf will be right up there as one of the most crucial players for the team in Wednesday’s semi-final against France. Corinne Diacre’s side showed how they can dominate a game with their victory over reigning champions the Netherlands in the quarter-finals, the movement and dynamism in their game making it challenge for those in the middle of the park in orange. Oberdorf has big experience, playing cup finals, high stake Champions League games and even in the World Cup three years ago – but this will be the biggest match of her career. For some, especially those just 20 years old, that would be daunting. For this particular young star, it’s unlikely to be. The way she embraces the big occasion is just another reason why she is one of the most exciting talents on the planet right now – and why she’s been one of the best players at this summer’s Euros.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/20-years-old-germany-lena-oberdorf-women-euros/bltd0a556f1e3b0957b,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

7233,England break Women's Euro attendance record as huge crowd sees Lionesses defeat Austria in opener,"England got their Women's Euro 2022 campaign off to a winning start in record-breaking fashion, as the Lionesses posted an all-time competition high attendance during their 1-0 tournament-opening win over Austria at Old Trafford. Beth Mead's first-half finish was enough for the hosts to ensure they got off on the right foot for this summer's tournament, taking them to the top of Group A and laying down a gauntlet for their rivals. But as gratifying as their strong start on the pitch will have been for Sarina Wiegman's side, it will be the eye-catching number of fans that piled into the Theatre of Dreams on opening night that will have delighted tournament organisers and supporters across the continent. England's Group A game against Austria drew the highest-ever crowd for a Women's European Championship game, with 68,871 in attendance on Wednesday evening. The figure smashes the previous record for the competition, set in the Euro 2013 Final in Stockholm, when 41,301 attended Germany's win over Norway. It does however fall short of both England's record attendance for a match - 77,768, posted at Wembley Stadium for a friendly against Germany in 2019 - and the all-time highest attendance for a women's game, when Barcelona faced Wolfsburg in the UEFA Women's Champions League earlier this year, with 91,648 present at Camp Nou. However, the final at Wembley Stadium later in this tournament could draw another record crowd. Mead, who netted her 15th international goal of the season-long cycle to extend her England record, admitted that the feeling inside Old Trafford was ""beyond words"". ""What an amazing night to start the tournament with a win,"" she told BBC One. ""I'm really happy to get a goal for the team.

7238,Hannah Eurlings: The teenage 'Eden Hazard of Belgium's women's team',"It was the final day of the Women’s Euros group stage and Belgium were playing the biggest game in the history of its women’s team. In their starting XI for the winner-takes-all clash with Italy were national icons, from two-time Champions League winner Janice Cayman to the Red Flames’ all-time top scorer, Tessa Wullaert. Alongside them on the teamsheet, though, was a name that many believe has the potential to hit the same heights over the course of her career; a teenage talent with the world at her feet by the name of Hannah Eurlings. “She was ready,” Ives Serneels, the Belgium head coach told GOAL, explaining his decision to start 19-year-old Eurlings in such a huge game. “She showed already, in our qualification games, that she has a lot of talent.” What unfolded on the pitch in Manchester would be historic. Tine De Caigny scored the only goal of the game to take the Red Flames into their first ever major tournament quarter-final, on just their second attempt. Eurlings took to Instagram after the game to celebrate the achievement. One of the images she used was of her celebrating De Caigny’s goal, running off to celebrate with a player she cites as one of her role models, alongside Cayman and Wullaert. It’s quite a moment to have at such a young age. Eurlings was three years old when she started to play football. Her obsession for the sport meant she trained every morning and every evening, that passion and dedication being something she is grateful for today as “without it, I would be tactically and technically less advanced,” she said in an interview with HLN. Her parents would grant her wish to join a club and, after several years of playing with the boys, she would go to the Topsport talent school in Leuven at the age of 14. It was around that time that she was recruited by OH Leuven - the club she debuted for as a 16-year-old - and also started to make her mark in the national teams. With Belgium, she was put straight into the Under-16 and U17 sides, skipping the U15s entirely. It was a sign of things to come as, two years ago, she then jumped right up into the senior team. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: “I don't often feel stressed when I step onto a football pitch,” she said in an interview with the Belgian FA, recalling her debut. “But the match against Switzerland did cause me some stress.” Since then, the tricky winger has become a fixture in Serneels’ plans. Her energy, intelligence and youthful confidence has helped her win a further 20 caps in the last 18 months, bringing her four goals as well. In fact, the impression Eurlings has made has been so good that she’s even been referred to as 'the Eden Hazard of the Red Flames' in the Belgian media. She’s everything you would want in a young forward – a nuisance for oppisition defenders with her movement and quick feet, a player with strong enough awareness of her surroundings to be good defensively as well as in linking up with team-mates, but also a real hard-worker who doesn’t shirk her responsibilities off the ball. As that latter strength alludes to, as well as the dedicated training she was doing as a young girl, Eurlings has a rare quality given her age and position, in the discipline from within that is helping to drive her promising career forward. 🤙 Hannah  ̶E̶u̶r̶l̶i̶n̶g̶s̶ Eurlingsinho #TheWorldAtOurFeet pic.twitter.com/UCBiGnHg0I “Football is a team sport and you can excel in one match, but the team is still the most important and if you grow as a team, you also grow individually,” she explained. It’s a trait matched by steely determination, too. “I set the bar very high for myself and that has made me the player I am today. I just really want to win because from the moment I feel I am performing, the satisfaction is huge. If I didn't set the bar so high for myself, I don't think I would be here.” So far, that attitude has made her a prolific goal-scorer in Belgium’s domestic league and has taken her to a major tournament, all as a teenager. Next on the list of aims is to go abroad ""in France, or England or Spain"" and become a professional footballer for the first time. After glimpses of the electricity she can bring to a pitch in England, she’ll have caught the eye of a few clubs, that’s for certain. It would be the next step in announcing herself and her abilities to a bigger audience. But before then, Eurlings has the small matter of a Euros quarter-final, with the Red Flames to face Olympic champions Sweden on Friday. Whatever happens on that night and in the next few years, though, the forward will always be a part of Belgian women’s football history. That’s not a bad way to kick off your career.

7245,USWNT & Lyon star Macario reveals 'devastating' ACL injury that will keep her out of CONCACAF Women’s Championship,"United States women's national team and Lyon star Catarina Macario has revealed a ""devastating"" ACL injury that will keep her out of summer competition with her nation. Macario just won the Women's Champions League and Division 1 Feminine with her club and had hoped to participate in the CONCACAF Women’s Championship, which will take place next month. Her rapid development is now on hold, though, as the 22-year-old must begin a difficult rehab process. The UWCL final scorer and Division 1 Feminine Player of the Year nominee posted a message to fans on social media revealing her setback and describing her emotions. ""Unfortunately, injuries are a natural part of football,"" Macario wrote. ""Tearing an ACL is never easy, and although I am devastated to be away from the field and my teammates for a few months, I could not be more proud of my first year as a professional footballer and to have helped the team reconquer two big titles this season. ""As challenging as the recovery process may be, I believe that God is in control of everything, so I have no doubt that with the right support system, patience, and hard work, I will be back better and hungrier than ever before."" pic.twitter.com/x9nfMn7LnD After the USWNT slumped to Bronze in the 2021 Olympics, the squad is eager to get back on track this summer and is savoring a potential rematch with the Canada side that won Gold in Tokyo.

7260,Beckham admits Inter Miami 'haven't lived up to what we wanted' after two disappointing seasons,"David Beckham has admitted Inter Miami have failed to live up to expectations across their first two years in Major League Soccer, but the former Manchester United star says he still takes pride in how far they have come. The former England captain has been the driving force behind the expansion outfit's move into MLS, but his team has struggled to produce results on the pitch. With former team-mate Phil Neville as manager, Beckham remains hopeful they can kick on - but is under no illusion they have struggled to match the hopes they had over the past few campaigns. ""I have had to learn to have a little bit more patience, which my wife will tell you I don't really have that much of,"" Beckham told the Daily Mail ahead of Miami's clash with Chicago Fire. ""But as an owner, and someone that has high expectations, you have to have a little bit. ""I've needed it over the last eight years to bring this club into this great city and into this league. In the last two years, I have had to learn to have even more. ""Everybody knows the expectations and pressures that we have. Yes, the last couple of years haven't lived up to exactly what we wanted, but I think when we step back and look at the last eight years, I'm very proud of what we've achieved."" In appointing Neville - a former team-mate for both United and England, and the former Lionesses boss who secured a World Cup semi-final finish - the Miami owner has extended a bond that stretches back to when both were teenagers. 'His professionalism, hard work, his commitment, for me, was one of the biggest reasons in bringing him into this club,"" he added. ""Stability is important and of course, we need to be successful on the field. ""When you look at the great clubs around the world - Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool - the work that Jurgen Klopp has done within Liverpool behind the scenes is one of the reasons why they're so successful on the field. ""That's why I think the work that Phil has done has been incredible - but talking about us as friends, we'll always be friends, no matter what happens.""

7288,USWNT prospect Fishel fires warning to NWSL with Tigres transfer,"When Mia Fishel fell to the Orlando Pride at the fifth pick in December’s NWSL Draft, it felt almost serendipitous. Fishel, one of the top American attacking prospects, would be reuniting with her college coach Amanda Cromwell, who had only just left UCLA to take over the Pride. The Pride also had a glaring hole in its forward line after Alex Morgan moved across the country to join up with the expansion San Diego Wave. The Pride, unsurprisingly, snapped up Fishel, giving the talented 20-year-old the perfect spot to begin her pro career. But there was a notable twist in this storybook ending: Fishel did not want to be in Orlando. In hindsight, the problems were too numerous to overcome: Fishel was upset at the process which led to her selection by the Pride. She felt blindsided when the team picked her. She preferred other teams. And, most importantly, Fishel resented the entire draft process, which strips players of agency in their final destination. Fishel's desire to wrest back control led her to a place many, including the striker herself, would have previously never considered as a landing spot for a top American prospect: Mexico. “I wasn't expecting to be here a couple of months ago, but with the whole NWSL draft, I felt like I wanted to take control of my own destiny and where I want to play, and with the draft, you just can't do that,” Fishel tells GOAL on the latest episode of All of US: The U.S. Women’s Soccer Show. In January, Fishel signed with Tigres, the top team in Liga MX Femenil. It was a blow for Orlando and the NWSL, and a major coup for an up-and-coming league that only launched in 2017, and only started to allow foreign signings last year. “What I did was historic,” Fishel says, not entirely inaccurately. “You don't see U.S. players coming to Mexico.” “This hasn't been done yet,” she adds. “And the rate at which the league has been growing was also very appealing. They've only been here for five years or so and the global media recognition, the passionate fans, playing in [large] stadiums, you just don't get that in the U.S. ""I think that I deserve to be in a place where I would be appreciated and seen.” Though Fishel speaks highly of her new surroundings, it also seems clear that she would’ve happily started her pro career in the NWSL – if she had more control over the process. “I knew a couple of minutes before I got drafted that I was going to Orlando Pride,” Fishel recalls. “That wasn't my top choice to go to Orlando, and I didn't hear anything from the general manager, the coaches about me going there. So it was a little bit of a shock. “It kind of sucked being in that position, knowing that I wanted to go to other teams and I got chosen by a team that hadn’t talked to me yet [to see] how I feel.” Asked why the Pride were not her first choice, Fishel replies: “It's a rebuilding team. They have amazing players as well, like Marta and Sydney Leroux. But I was looking at bigger clubs like Portland Thorns or my coach in the [U.S.] Under-20s, Laura Harvey (now coach of OL Reign) – just the familiarity with her and I really liked how she coached. “The NWSL draft, it's not 100 per cent up to me. That’s how the draft is kind of built.” When contacted by GOAL, the Pride said in a statement: ""Ahead of the 2022 NWSL Draft, our general manager and coaching staff spoke to representatives for many of the top prospects, including Mia’s agent at the time, to ensure their interest and commitment in becoming a member of the Pride, which is standard practice for our club.  ""We wish Mia the best of luck this season in Mexico and look forward to seeing her have a long and successful professional playing career."" Frustrated with the hand she was dealt and yet to sign with Orlando, Fishel considered her options. In Monterrey, Tigres saw an opportunity to secure a statement-making signing, and the club was ready to pull out all the stops. “I was looking at all my options, and Tigres came and reached out with an amazing presentation of what it means to be a Tigres player,” Fishel says, “their staff, their team, how they're built for champions, built for sold-out stadiums [have an] amazing fan base, have global media recognition. So it was really hard to pass up this opportunity.” It’s difficult not to view Fishel’s signing as the opening salvo in a nascent battle for talent between the NWSL and Liga MX, whose chief Mariana Gutierrez Bernardez told GOAL last fall that her league wants to start importing top talent in a bid to become the “best league in the world.” It is not clear if Fishel’s signing is the beginning of a movement or a one-off, but if Liga MX sides can continue to offer more money than the NWSL, as is reportedly the case for Fishel, then more players could look southward – or to Europe. As of December 2021, U.S. Soccer no longer pays the NWSL salaries of its USWNT players, giving those players much more freedom to choose to play in leagues outside of the American top flight. Between the new freedom of players, a draft system that restricts choice, and foreign clubs just discovering their checkbooks, the competition for talent has never been tougher for the NWSL. One of the biggest manifestations of that growing threat hopes that she can serve as an example to others. “I'm really happy and I hope that I can grow this league as well,” Fishel says, “creating another path for other players in the U.S. who may think that the NWSL is not their choice.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uswnt-prospect-fishel-warning-nwsl-tigres-transfer/bltfa8c23f2d72e05da,Seth Vertelney,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7327,Forget Real Madrid: Why Lyon are the greatest Champions League team of all time,"The 2022 Champions League final between Lyon and Barcelona is about more than a trophy.  For Ada Hegerberg, it's also about respect. ""There was women's football before Barcelona, ​​and it was played here for years,"" the Lyon legend told L’Equipe last month.  ""We have to win again to regain our place in world football and we have the chance to do it this season. We have never lost against Barcelona."" It's clear that Lyon are irked by the fact that the Blaugranes not only took their title last season, but also their status as the darlings of the women's game.  For the past year, the whole football world has been astounded by Barca's dominant displays and record-breaking attendances. Hegerberg & Co. evidently feel that their remarkable feats have been overlooked, forgotten almost. That certainly shouldn't be the case, of course.  After all, we're not just talking about the greatest team the women's Champions League has ever seen. Lyon are the greatest team the tournament has ever seen full stop. Remember, the most successful men's side in the Champions League era is Real Madrid, who won three in a row between 2016 and 2018. Lyon matched them every step of the way but then added two more titles for good measure, in 2019 and 2020. Of course, the Madrid of Gento, Puskas and Di Stefano also claimed five European Cups in a row. However, not even that legendary side have dominated the tournament quite like Lyon have for more than a decade. Madrid won six European Cups in 11 seasons between 1955 and 1966, while also finishing as runners-up twice. Lyon, though, have won seven since making their first final in 2010 – also losing two along the way – and are now bidding for what would be an eighth triumph in 12 years. Their longevity is truly astounding, a testament to not only Jean-Michel Aulas' admirable willingness to invest in top talent, but also the club's culture of excellence. ""We have had a squad for a number of years and a president who believes in this, who has given us money and resources to build a top level side,"" captain Wendie Renard said. ""Players come and go but we try to keep this Lyon DNA."" Indeed, it has been integral to their sustained success.  What a feeling... une soirée mémorable 🔥🦁 𝙎𝙚𝙚 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙞𝙣 𝙏𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣 ❤️💙Hommage à l'aigle des Açores 😉🔥 pic.twitter.com/K1WS3oWxu9 Renard is one of only three players remaining from the side that lost on penalties to Turbine Potsdam in their first Champions League final, all the way back in 2010, along with Sarah Bouhaddi and Amandine Henry. However, Lyon instilled a work ethic that has never changed, meaning their standards have never dropped. Alice Sombath, for example, came through the ranks at Paris Saint-Germain, who have begun to invest heavily in their women's team in recent years, yet she says she only ""realised what it meant to be a professional"" after arriving at Lyon. Kenza Dali, meanwhile, says that every day she spent at the club was a test of her quality and commitment. ""When you work at Lyon, you understand why they win everything,"" the West Ham midfielder explained.  ""Every training is so hard, really hard, they train so hard. You have to win your place every day."" There is no let-up, essentially. Even on the rare occasions they lose, they return better than before, which is exactly what they'll be aiming to prove against Barcelona in Turin on May 21. As former Lyon forward Lotta Schelin told GOAL, ""Winning, that's hard enough, but losing and then coming back? That's when you can see the real winners. ""That's why Lyon's history is perfect in a way.” And that's also why they are the greatest side in Champions League history…",https://www.goal.com/en/news/forget-real-madrid-lyon-greatest-champions-league-team-ever/blt397220f4b2a9ed0d,Mark Doyle,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7329,"SheBelieves Cup 2022: USWNT tournament fixture schedule, TV channels, rosters & guide","The U.S. women's national team and the SheBelieves Cup returned in February, with the hosts taking on the Czech Republic, Iceland and New Zealand in the 2022 edition, which began on February 17. It was the first action of the year for all four teams, with Vlatko Andonovski's U.S. side not having played any friendlies in its January camp in 2022. Four of the six games in the round-robin tournament were played in California, at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, while the final two fixtures were held in Texas, at the Toyota Stadium in Frisco. The USWNT emerged victorious after two wins and a draw from its three fixtures. Broadcast information for the 2022 SheBelieves Cup was announced shortly before the tournament, with games shown across ESPN, TUDN and PRENDETV in the United States. The Czech Republic was the first to announce its roster for the tournament, doing so on February 2. Andrea Staskova was one of the most exciting names in the team, the 21-year-old Juventus striker who has made a strong impression in Italy. The USWNT revealed its squad on February 3, one that grabbed plenty of attention, missing the likes of Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan, with Andonovski focusing on some of younger and fringe players. Defender Abby Dahlkemper was initially in the squad but withdrew due to a back injury, paving the way for teenage starlet Trinity Rodman to be included and make her debut. On February 4, Iceland announced its roster, featuring players from six different leagues across the world. Gunnhildur Yrsa Jonsdottir was one of the most recognizable names for U.S. fans, the 33-year-old midfielder currently playing for NWSL side Orlando Pride. New Zealand completed the squad announcements on February 7, its roster headlined by the return of defender Rebekah Stott. Stott, a massively popular and valuable member of her national team, was diagnosed with stage 3 Hodgkin's Lymphoma at the beginning of last year and has undergone successful treatment to pave the way for her incredible recall.

England secured the title with a 2-1 win after extra-time against Germany in the final and Mead was a pivotal figure in their journey to securing the title. The 27-year-old featured in all six matches that England played to secure their first European Championship title. The winger was given the Player of the Match award twice in the tournament.

7381,Lisanne Grawe: Germany & Leverkusen’s ‘special’ teen midfielder inspired by Kroos,"Achim Feifel, the sporting director of Bayer Leverkusen’s women’s team, is thinking back to when he first started to work Lisanne Grawe, the club’s talented teenage midfielder. As he does so, he laughs. Two years of playing in the second division with two-time European champions Wolfsburg's reserves hadn't satisfied the youngster, and so she made the move west, to join a team that could give her the minutes her development needed. Feifel, head coach at the time, was excited about the signing. He knew all about Grawe, having first seen her in an Under-16s tournament when she was playing for her regional team. However, when he finally got to work with her last summer, he would still be taken aback. “I think she’s very cool under pressure,” he tells GOAL with a little chuckle, asked if anything surprised him about Grawe. “At this age, not many players have this calmness and this is what I could see in the first training sessions. I was surprised.” Despite having only ever played once in the Frauen-Bundesliga during her time with Wolfsburg, it’s a trait that would allow Grawe - who ranked fifth in the 2022 NXGN list of the world's best teenage footballers - to quickly become a key piece of Leverkusen’s line up last year. It is also one of many reasons why she is one of the most promising young talents in Germany, in Europe and beyond – a reputation she will no doubt back up at this summer’s U20 Women’s World Cup in Costa Rica. Grawe started playing football with her father and two brothers and would soon join a local side, FC Kaunitz, before moving to SC Wiedenbruck aged 14. With both, she’d played for the boys’ teams, something she only stopped doing when she joined Wolfsburg at 16 years old. “It's physically something completely different,” she said in an interview with Eurosport. “I think I took a lot from that. Also, in terms of speed. With the girls, you could have held the ball longer and played more one-on-one, so I solved the situations more by eye and passing. It was also important for the speed of thought, so there were a few things I took away from that time.” There’s no doubt that path has developed Grawe's reading and anticipation of the game massively, two huge strengths of hers in central midfield. Her vision and passing are two other stand-out attributes, which perhaps shouldn't come as a surprise given she has long idolised Germany icon Toni Kroos, watching videos of him regularly to see how he distributes the ball. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: “You could see in the youth teams that she had good technical possibilities, she can use both feet,” Feifel says, remembering what made her stand out when he first saw her play. “She was very good at [dictating] the rhythm of the team from the central position. Also, in speed and in athletic possibilities, you could see early on that she could become a special player.” Added to that raw talent, though, is real dedication. Grawe's decision to leave one of Europe’s top clubs to get game time in the Bundesliga shows her hunger, even as a teenager. “It's very important that she reached the point of playing on the weekend and having many, many games last year,” Feifel believes. “It's very good for her development. “It was her first season coming from the second league into the first league and sometimes she also has problems in the games, and she can see the things she has to become better at. “I hope - and we are sure - that in the second season now, she can take the next step and reach more and more stability in the games, and from game to game have higher stability in her way of playing."" That new season will come under a new coach, with Feifel having moved into the sporting director role this summer and Robert de Pauw taking over the team, the Dutchman having led FC Twente to the title in his native Netherlands last campaign. “I think the new coach will play football, he will come in attack not with long balls, but with the midfield players, with passing,” his predecessor says. “I think it is good for the central midfielders that the coach will have this style of playing and so it's good for also for the development of Lisanne.

7388,‘My son sat in his stroller while I trained' – How McDonald balanced soccer and motherhood to become a world champion with the USWNT,"When Jessica McDonald gave birth to her son, Jeremiah, in 2012, she did not envisage becoming a world champion with the U.S. women’s national team seven years later. There is a growing number of soccer players embracing motherhood – Alex Morgan and Sydney Leroux are among those to return the game after pregnancy – but it was not common when McDonald did it 10 years ago. Getting back to full fitness, managing the small salary she got from her club and balancing motherhood with her profession were all obstacles conquered, as well as a knee injury before pregnancy that should have ended her career. But it did not. Fast-forward to today, and the 33-year-old is a World Cup winner and a three-time NWSL champion. When McDonald got that medal around her neck that confirmed her as a world champion, Jeremiah was there, sprinkling confetti over her, holding the trophy aloft himself, soaking the moment in – one McDonald is not sure he fully understands yet. “He just knows mom plays soccer and that's how I make money,” she tells GOAL. “He hasn't quite grasped the intensity of my job, like how big the World Cup is. “Anytime I'm at camp and he's with me, he's like, 'Mom, where's Megan Rapinoe?!' He has no idea. He just knows she's my team-mate. She's just another person to him. This kid's best friend is Megan Rapinoe! He has no idea who this powerful woman is, but he's so innocent. “My goal, my dream, the ups and downs, my journey to get to that [World Cup win] and being able to share it with my son was just the most incredible, most amazing, happiest day, moment, literally of my entire life. “I'm happy and proud to say that he's going to remember it, because he was seven years old at the time. One day, we're going to have a nice little chat about it and I'm hoping and praying that it's going to inspire him with whatever it is he's going to do in his future. “I think that's going to be really helpful, him having that memory also, us celebrating the successful times throughout mom's life, because he won't remember the struggle, which I'm very happy about.” That struggle started with patellar tendon surgery and a two-year recovery.  “I didn’t think I was going to be playing sports again!” McDonald says. “I was training with guys just to stay in shape, really, and I accepted at one point throughout my recovery that I was never going to play again. “I didn't think I'd be here. I really didn't, because I was told that I'm not supposed to be.” She got “back into the swing of things” with a short stint in Australia, though, where a run to the Grand Final and a prolific goal-scoring season with Melbourne Victory gave her confidence. “I think giving birth to my son helped heal me in so many different types of ways. I'm fitter now at 33 than I was at 18,” she adds.  It’s quite a statement, since she reveals she had a relatively smooth transition back from pregnancy due to being in such great shape. “Giving birth to him really helped me – in terms of mind, body and spirit.” McDonald returned to NWSL, the top league in the U.S., but was making just $15,000 (£11,000) a year for her first few seasons.  She would receive “dabbles of support here and there” but nothing that was “enough”. “My son sat in his stroller a lot of days during my training sessions, because I couldn't even afford childcare,” she explains. “[Those were] some of the worst times of my life, to be honest.  ""I played for six different teams in six different states and cities in my first five years in NWSL, all while having my son by my side. It was a true struggle, because NWSL wasn't supporting moms at the time. “It made me really question my career, if this was what I wanted to continue to do. “But we all go through a struggle at some point in our lives. It's truly humbled me and I'm grateful that I went through that because, going through adversity, I feel like I could just get through anything in my life, because that truly prepared me for the worst.” After several years, McDonald would achieve her biggest goal. She got her first call-up for the USWNT in 2016, which was not just a breakthrough moment on a professional level, but in her personal life, too. “The only time I ever had 100 per cent support as a mom is with the U.S. national team, because they hire nannies, they fly them out there, they house them, they feed them, whoever we want to come and watch our kid,” she explains. “I'm like, 'where has this been my whole career? Why don't we have this in NWSL?' “I think that's something we have to continue to fight for in this league, because I have so many friends who have retired at such an early age who were absolutely maniacs at soccer, but they wanted to be moms.” Today, NWSL provides the mothers in the league with a stipend every year for childcare. “Still not enough,” McDonald adds, “but we’re getting something, so that’s a start.” The forward is also supporting the parents in the league in her own way. She is a true role model to those who want to start a family without having to sacrifice their careers at the same time. Given what she has achieved, she sets an incredible example, too. “I've had so many of my mom friends hitting me up with issues that they've had or any type of information that they need,” McDonald says.  “It’s nice to be able to carry that mom leadership over because I'm a veteran now – a veteran mom, I guess you could say. “I do the best I can to help the others, but it's been a joy to see other women kind of looking up to me as the mom and kind of picking my brain how to handle certain things, especially within our league. “We're superheroes. We're making it a new norm that we don't always have to be in the house and be in the kitchen. We can forget all that. “It's 2022. Moms can do anything, because we're bad-ass at the end of the day.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/son-stroller-training-mcdonald-balanced-soccer-motherhood/bltba4bea0b290effe2,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7394,"Arnold Clark Cup 2022 squads: England, Canada, Germany & Spain rosters in full","England will host the inaugural Arnold Clark Cup in February, with the hosts welcoming Canada, Germany and Spain for the tournament. The competition, which begins on February 17, will serve as ideal preparation for all four nations ahead of the summer. England, Germany and Spain are all considered contenders for this summer’s Euros, while Canada will be participating in the CONCACAF Women’s Championship, looking to dethrone the U.S. women’s national team. Tickets to watch England, Germany, Spain and Canada play in the Arnold Clark Cup are available now. Matches are being broadcast live in the UK on ITV. England head coach Sarina Wiegman revealed her squad for this competition on February 8, with Lucy Bronze, Ellie Roebuck and Leah Williamson all returning after injuries. Captain Steph Houghton is missing, having suffered a setback with her achilles, which she injured back in September. Chelsea forward Beth England is also injured. On February 16, it was announced that defender Lotte Wubben-Moy would return to Arsenal to work on her rehab programme, having missed the Gunners' game with Chelsea before the international break. No replacement was called up. Goalkeepers: Mary Earps, Hannah Hampton, Ellie Roebuck. Defenders: Millie Bright, Lucy Bronze, Jess Carter, Niamh Charles, Rachel Daly, Alex Greenwood, Demi Stokes, Leah Williamson. Midfielders: Fran Kirby, Jordan Nobbs, Jill Scott, Georgia Stanway, Keira Walsh, Katie Zelem. Forwards: Lauren Hemp, Beth Mead, Nikita Parris, Alessia Russo, Ella Toone, Ellen White. Player to watch: Lauren Hemp Manchester City's season might have been quite up-and-down, but Lauren Hemp has consistently been one of the best players in the Women's Super League this season despite that. The 21-year-old winger is an absolute nightmare for full-backs with her confidence, willingness to run at players and sheer talent. There's no doubt she'll be one of the most electric players on display at the Arnold Clark Cup. Head coach Bev Priestman announced her 23-player squad for the tournament on February 7, making Canada the first nation to do so. Eighteen of the names involved were on the roster last summer, when Canada won gold at the Olympic Games. Of those, full-back Ashley Lawrence and centre-back Vanessa Gilles were included in GOAL's team of the tournament, demonstrative of the strength of this team's defence. However, there is no Christine Sinclair among the ranks, with the Portland Thorns star taking a leave of absence for personal reasons following her mother's passing following a battle with multiple sclerosis. Goalkeepers: Sabrina D’Angelo, Devon Kerr, Erin McLeod, Kailen Sheridan. Defenders: Kadeisha Buchanan, Vanessa Gilles, Shelina Zadorsky, Gabrielle Carle, Allysha Chapman, Jayde Riviere, Sura Yekka. Midfielders: Marie-Yasmine Alidou D’Anjou, Jessie Fleming, Julia Grosso, Ashley Lawrence, Victoria Pickett, Quinn, Sophie Schmidt, Desiree Scott. Forwards: Janine Beckie, Tanya Boychuk, Jordyn Huitema, Cloe Lacasse, Nichelle Prince, Deanne Rose. Player to watch: Deanne Rose That Deanne Rose only played her first senior club match in September is a crazy fact. The 22-year-old, who debuted aged 16, had 61 senior caps, 10 goals and an Olympic gold medal with her national team before she first set foot on the pitch for Reading, the Women's Super League side she joined last summer. The forward's impact at the Olympics largely came off the bench and it was game-changing, particularly in the semi-final win against the United States. She's already scored four goals this season for her new club - including a match-winner against reigning WSL champions Chelsea. Jorge Vilda's squad for the Arnold Clark Cup was announced on February 8. One of the most exciting national teams in the world, the squad features 10 players from Barcelona, the undisputed best team in Europe right now. Manchester United full-back Ona Batlle is the only player who plays her football outside of her homeland. On February 14, Barcelona defender Irene Paredes withdrew from the squad due to injury, with Atletico Madrid's Sheila Garcia called up in her place. On February 15, it was announced that Real Madrid midfielder Claudia Zornoza - who was looking to make her first national team appearance in six years - had tested positive for COVID-19. Barcelona's Claudia Pina has taken her place in the squad. After suffering a hamstring injury in the opening game against Germany, Barcelona forward Mariona Caldentey returned to her club for further tests. Real Madrid's Athenea del Castillo joined the squad as her replacement. Goalkeepers: Sandra Panos, Lola Gallardo, Misa Rodriguez. Defenders: Mapi Leon, Leila Ouahabi, Andrea Pereira, Ivana Andres, Ona Batlle, Laia Aleixandri, Olga Carmona. Midfielders: Alexia Putellas, Patri Guijarro, Aitana Bonmati, Irene Guerrero, Claudia Pina. Forwards: Jennifer Hermoso, Mariona Caldentey, Lucia Garcia, Esther Gonzalez, Marta Cardona, Nerea Eizagirre, Amaiur Sarriegi, Sheila Garcia, Athenea del Castillo. Player to watch: Alexia Putellas The best player in the world right now, Alexia Putellas became the first Spanish woman to win the Ballon d'Or at the end of last year, and the first Spaniard to do so since Luis Suarez in 1960. Her elegance on the ball, her ability to carve out chances for her team-mates and her own goal-scoring threat was crucial to Barcelona winning the treble last season. Going forward, she will hope it can be crucial to glory for Spain. Germany's squad was revealed on February 8, with Turbine Potsdam's Selina Cerci receiving her first senior call-up. Sara Doorsoun and Nicole Anyomi, both of Eintracht Frankfurt, have returned after injuries, but there are still stars absent. Wolfsburg's Alex Popp, Bayern Munich's Sydney Lohmann, Lyon's Dzsenifer Marozsan and Chelsea's Melanie Leupolz are among the biggest names missing. Svenja Huth, Lena Lattwein, Almuth Schult, Tabea Wassmuth, Sjoeke Nusken and Kathrin Hendrich were all in Germany's initial squad, but were ruled out of the tournament due to various reasons. Chantal Hagel, Martina Tufekovic, Hasret Kayikci, Ramona Petzelberger, Leonie Maier and Sarai Linder were called up to the squad as a result. Goalkeepers: Ann-Katrin Berger, Merle Frohms, Martina Tufekovic. Defenders: Sara Doorsoun, Jana Feldkamp, Giulia Gwinn, Sophia Kleinherne, Lena Oberdorf, Maximiliane Rall, Felicitas Rauch, Leonie Maier, Sarai Linder. Midfielders: Nicole Anyone, Jule Brand, Klara Buhl, Selina Cerci, Sara Dabritz, Linda Dallmann, Fabienne Dongus, Laura Freigang, Lina Magull, Ramona Petzelberger, Chantal Hagel. Forwards: Lea Schuller, Hasret Kayikci. Player to watch: Lena Oberdorf GOAL's first ever women's NXGN winner, Lena Oberdorf's talent has been known for some time. She burst onto the scene with Essen at the age of 16 and after two impressive seasons, two-time European champions Wolfsburg came knocking. After being a very versatile option with Essen, playing in a number of position, Oberdorf has developed into one of the best holding midfielders in the game with Wolfsburg. The 21-year-old has maturity that defies her age.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arnold-clark-cup-2022-squads-england-canada-germany-spain/blt2e903ca6a4fe1e14,Amee Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7411,When are the USWNT fixtures in 2021? U.S. team match schedule,"The U.S. women's national team had an eventful year in 2021, with the bronze medal-winning Olympic campaign grabbing plenty of headlines. Vlatko Andonovski's side were the favourites going into the tournament but stuttered throughout, though they did not leave empty handed. Here, GOAL has everything you need to know about the USWNT's games before, during and after the Olympic Games. Andonovski's team started 2021 positively. They won two friendlies against Colombia in January and then retained their SheBelieves Cup title a month later, beating Canada, Brazil and Argentina. A draw with Sweden in April was disappointing, but they bounced back with a 2-0 win over France just three days later. The world champions then recorded three wins in six days in June, their 'Summer Series' against Portugal, Jamaica and Nigeria looking to replicate the tight turnaround between games of the Olympics. The send-off to Tokyo was completed with a double-header against Mexico, both games won 4-0. The U.S. started its campaign in Japan with a shocking 3-0 defeat to Sweden, a team that would go on to win the silver medal. Andonovski's side beat New Zealand in the next game, 6-1, before a goalless draw with Australia rounded off the group stages. After qualifying in second place from their group, the USWNT beat the Netherlands in the quarter-finals in a rematch of the 2019 Women's World Cup final to set up a semi-final match up with Canada. However, it was there that their quest for gold would end, as their Concacaf rivals inflicted an historic 1-0 defeat. The consolation for this team was that they claimed a bronze medal in their final fixture of the tournament, beating Australia 4-3 in a thrilling match that could prove to be the final major tournament game for some of the team's most recognizable stars. Carli Lloyd was one who announced her retirement shortly after the end of the Games. Following that tournament, the U.S. played six friendlies to end the calendar year. The team beat Paraguay twice in a double header before facing another against South Korea. The first was a goalless draw, while the second saw the team bid farewell to the legendary Lloyd, whose final match for her country was a 6-0 victory over the Asian nation. The year ended with another double header, this one in Australia against the Matildas. Andonovski chose a more experimental roster for those two games, which saw the United States pick up a 3-0 win in the first game before a 1-1 draw capped off a difficult 2021.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/when-are-uswnt-fixtures-in-2021-us-team-match-schedule/405y8178h2egzcm2rx4v68fq,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7455,Women's Euro 2022 prize money: How much do winning team earn?,"International competition at an elite level in sport is rarely about the financial rewards on offer, but the winners of Women’s Euro 2022 stand to enjoy considerable monetary benefits alongside the major silverware that they are all so desperate to get their hands on. Being crowned continental queens will guarantee a place in the history books, while also boosting a few bank balances along the way. What does the European Championship prize pot stand at and how is it broken down between those nations taking part in a prestigious tournament? GOAL takes a look… The total prize money on offer at the Women’s Euro in 2022 is €16 million (£13.5m/$16m) – with that pot being the highest ever for the event and double that from the last staging of the competition in 2017. The funds available are allocated according to two criteria, with 60 per cent distributed equally among the participating nations and 40 per cent dependent on results. All of the 16 teams gracing a major international event will receive a split of €9.6m (£8.1m/$9.6m) regardless of how they fare on the field, with that package equating to €600,000 (£507k/$603k). The remaining €6.4m (£5.4m/$6.4m) relates to performance, with almost two thirds of that pot handed out during the knockout rounds. Tickets for this summer's Women's Euro 2022 final at Wembley sold out in less than an hour 🏟 pic.twitter.com/rjenZdRaHB For the first time at a Women’s Euro, financial rewards are on offer in the group stage. On top of a guaranteed payment of €600,000, each team will receive €100,000 (£85k/$100k) for a win and €50,000 (£42k/$50k) for a draw – meaning that a grand total of €900,000 (£761k/$905k) could be accumulated by those collecting three victories. Teams reaching the quarter-finals will receive €205,000 (£173k/$206k), while a spot in the last four is worth a further €320,000 (£271k/$322k). The winners of Women’s Euro 2022 will pick up €660,000 (£558k/$664k), with the runners-up taking home €420,000 (£355k/$422k) – a faultless run through the entire competition for the victors would net them a total of €2,085,000. Win bonuses for those included in the squad of ultimate champions are determined by individual football associations. UEFA has had a club benefits programme in place for some time, with it important to recognise the contribution of those sides that make players available for major competitions. The Women’s Euro is involved in that scheme for the first time in 2022, with an overall pot of €4.5m (£3.8m/$4.5m) made available. That will be distributed between European clubs – not those in the NWSL – depending on how many days their players have to spend away on tournament duty. The process starts with the 10 official preparation days, followed by those spent actually competing and then one extra for travelling back. UEFA will pay out €500 (£423/$502) per player per day, with the minimum guaranteed amount for any individual performer standing at €10,000 (£8,400/$10,000) – with reimbursement fees set to be paid between October and December.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/women-euro-2022-prize-money-how-much-winning-team-earn/bltf9ffa0e1aa03ef6c,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7486,Neville says Man Utd were 'NAIVE' not to have a sporting director for 10 years,"Manchester United legend Gary Neville has called his former club 'naÃ¯ve' after years of operating without a sporting director.  Mail Sport exclusively revealed on Wednesday that the Red Devils are on the cusp of reaching an agreement with Newcastle over sporting director Dan Ashworth, who is keen on swapping St James' Park for Old Trafford. The 52-year-old is seen as the best in the business by incoming Man United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team, and the focus of his remit would be recruitment. Ashworth has not had as much control as he expected at Newcastle, the club he joined in the summer of 2022. There has been no fallout but it is thought the lure of the project at Man United, and his relationship with INEOS director of sport Sir Dave Brailsford, has persuaded him the time is right to move on.  Discussing Ashworth's imminent move to Old Trafford on the Stick to Football podcast by Sky Bet, Neville urged that Manchester United have been 'naÃ¯ve' and lost out on millions during negotiations without a sporting director. 'Agents have a bad reputation in football, but ultimately, they won't do someone over that they work well with, because they won't get the next gig. If an agent screwed over Liverpool, that agent wouldn't work with Liverpool again and it would spread quite quickly,' Neville said. 'Manchester United haven't had a sporting director for the last 10 years, so they've been so naÃ¯ve at that level. I imagine when they've been dealing with agents, if United called you, you knew you were going to get another Â£20-30million because they were naÃ¯ve and didn't have a relationship with agents.' Recruitment is Ratcliffe's number one priority at Manchester United, with the rebuild of Old Trafford secondary. INEOS are determined to find a better balance to recruitment than what has been achieved over the past 10 years and have identified Ashworth as the ideal lead to a new-look team. After impressing at West Bromwich Albion, Ashworth became the FA's Director of Elite Development in 2012 and pioneered 'England DNA', a player development plan for both the men's and women's teams. Despite attracting interest from United, Ashworth moved to Brighton as technical director in 2019 before taking on his new role at St James' Park in February 2022. Neville continued: 'Dan Ashworth did a good job at West Brom, but I was there with England when he was appointed, and it was a big change when he came in. It was quite a jolt at the time for Roy Hodgson to have a technical director like Dan Ashworth, who then brought in Dave Reddin who was a performance director.   'This was then they started talking about different types of coaches (e.g. attacking and defending coaches), and they were talking about attacking set piece coaches, breaking the game down to intimate detail, which was something Roy wasn't used to. 'I remember Dan having a conversation with Roy, but they were building all these foundations, where he started with the U21s, the U18s and with the women's team. You think of the success of all those teams in recent years, but that has been in the making for eight years, and it all started when Dan came in. 'Iâm not saying heâs responsible for what happened, but he had a big influence with FA. They were a terrible organisation from a professionalism point of view, and I felt what he did, he put processes in place where theyâre now structured and organised.'",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Neville-says-Man-Utd-were-NAIVE-not-to-have-a-sporting-director-for-10-years/3302799,,8 hours ago,all-football-app
7716,Chelsea Women make offer to Champions League-winning coach to replace Emma Hayes,"The hunt for Emma Hayesâ replacement could be over with Chelsea Women having offered a contact to Lyon head coach Sonia Bompastor.  The long-time Blues boss will depart at the end of the season as she takes up the vacant manager position with the USWNT. Selecting the candidate to replace one of womenâs footballâs most successful and influential managers in history was always going to prove to be a challenge. And while the process is still ongoing. Chelsea have zeroed in on the former Champions League winner Bompastor with the club negotiating a deal to appoint her, according to the Athletic. The 43-year-old â who won the Champions League as a player and manager â was promoted to womenâs head coach from her role within the Lyon academy following the departure of Jean-Luc Vasseur in April 2021. Her contract with the French giants is set to expire next year. Bompastorâs tenure at Lyon was successful almost from the start, with the new manager leading Lyon to a comfortable double as they won the Division 1 Feminine and the Womenâs Champions League. In total, Lyon went undefeated in 22 league matches that season while comprehensively beating Barcelona 3-1 in the final of the Champions League. The following season saw Lyon retain their league title, though a disappointing quarter-final exit from the Champions League awaited as they lost in a penalty shootout to Chelsea following a 2-2 aggregate tie over two legs. If Bombastor is to take the Chelsea position, she will be greeted by familiar faces. Indeed, both Catarina Macario and Kadeisha Buchanan were coached by Bompastor at Lyon before their transfers to west London in 2023 and 2022 respectively. Lyon are currently into the quarter-finals of the Champions League again this season, while they are 10 points clear of Paris Saint-Germain in the French top flight. Bombastorâs managerial success is an extension of the success she relished as a player, winning eight league titles across her stints at Montpellier and Lyon, as well as two Champions Leagues at the latter. Such a pedigree will be crucial if she is to replace Hayes. Since joining Chelsea in 2012, the 47-year-old has led the club to six WSL titles, five FA Cups, two FA Womenâs League Cups, one FA Womenâs Spring Series trophy, and one Womenâs Community Shield. San Diego Wave and former Manchester United Women manager Casey Stoney was one of the leading candidates to take over from Hayes, but the ex-England defender has since signed a new deal with the Wave keeping her in the NWSL. Meanwhile, Laura Harvey, a former Arsenal manager now at Seattle Reign, was a club guest at Stamford Bridge for the Champions League match against Hacken in December - but recently indicated that she too is happy in the USA.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Chelsea-Women-make-offer-to-Champions-League-winning-coach-to-replace-Emma-Hayes/3301788,,2 days ago,all-football-app
7736,Franca shows Chelsea what they missed & Palace fans vent their frustration,"Chelsea came from behind to beat Crystal Palace 3-1 thanks to added time goals from Conor Gallagher and Enzo Fernandez in the Premier League at Selhurst Park on Monday night.  Gallagher put the visitors 2-1 up with his second goal of the match before Fernandez sealed the win as Chelsea rallied to secure the points that took them up to 10th in the standings. It was a tale of two halves for the Blues who went into the break a goal down after a superb Jefferson Lerma strike before Gallagher fired home to equalise in the 47th minute. Monday's result was Chelsea's 13th consecutive win against Crystal Palace in the Premier League, a club record. Mail Sport's Kieran Gill takes a look at some of the things you may have missed. Chelsea wanted Matheus Franca last summer but it is believed their intention to send him away on an immediate loan to one of their affiliate clubs was not enticing enough for the 19-year-old Brazilian. Instead, he signed for Crystal Palace in a Â£26million move from Flamengo, with his contract even containing a Ballon dâOr nominee clause. Starting on the left wing, Franca and his team-mates did their best to torment Chelsea right back Malo Gusto, who struggled who struggled in the first half but went on to assist Conor Gallagherâs equaliser. It was not until the 45th minute not until the 45th minute of this match that Chelsea had a shot of any description, Conor Gallagher dragging an attempt wide. At least Chelsea Women showed Crystal Palace they know how to attack in their FA Cup fifth-round tie on Sunday with 13 attempts. Mayra Ramirez scored the winner â an outrageous flicked finish from a cross â as she got her first goal since Chelsea smashed the world-record fee for a female footballer three weeks ago. The Colombian, 24, cost Â£384,000 plus Â£42,600 in add-ons when bought from Levante. Chelsea are top of the Womenâs Super League. The less said about how the menâs season has been, the better. Good choice from the Selhurst Park DJ as we waited for the refereeing team to solve their technical issues so the second half could start. The silence was broken when Bob Marley's Three Little Birds suddenly started to play Petr Cech's surprise appearance on Sky Sportsâ Monday Night Football coincided with his interview dropping on Jake Humphreyâs High Performance Podcast, teased as: âWhy I left Chelsea.â Cechâs sudden media presence means we can only assume whatever non-disclosure agreement he had with Chelsea has expired, with it now 19 months since he left the club as a technical advisor. Cech spent last week on loan with Belfast Giants ice hockey team, though the Premier League great will return to the Oxford City Stars. There was no shortage of banners from Crystal Palaceâs frustrated fans. âWeak club culture and direction,â read one. âSupporters ignored and taken for granted,â another. âWeak transfer policy. Youth scapegoated,â a third. Passions can run high at Selhurst Park. Even one steward stood next to the media seats was singing at the top of his voice. Sometimes, the good work of fan groups can go unnoticed, but one initiative being organised by the Chelsea Supportersâ Trust is worthy of column inches. The CST are arranging so that up to 200 fans will be allowed to sleep under Stamford Bridgeâs East Stand next month. Not in a plush bed with pillows, but in a sleeping bag on top of a flattened cardboard box. The hope is to raise tens of thousands to combat homelessness and support vulnerable and disabled veterans so they can lead fulfilling lives. The proceeds from this âBig Stamford Bridge Sleep Outâ on March 23 will go to charities Stoll and Barons Court Project. The beauty of Chelseaâs academy being based at the same training ground as the first team â unlike other Premier League clubs such as West Ham â is that it encourages a good working relationship between the two. Ahead of this match, it is understood Charlie Holland, 14, and Rio Ngumoha, 15, trained alongside Raheem Sterling and Co under Mauricio Pochettino. Holland was also invited to train with the big boys when Frank Lampard was manager last season.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Franca-shows-Chelsea-what-they-missed--Palace-fans-vent-their-frustration/3301118,,13-Feb,all-football-app
7803,Matildas captain Sam Kerr celebrates milestone afterÂ horror ACL injury,"Matildas superstar Sam Kerr has been recorded walking around without crutches after a shock knee injury ruled her out of playing for Australia at the Paris Olympics.  Australia's captain and star Chelsea striker suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during Chelsea's warm weather training camp in January. On Tuesday, Kerr's teammate Millie Bright posted a promising social media update on the injury. Bright's Instagram story, captioned 'This makes me happy', showed a smiling Kerr walking in the physio room without crutches. Kerr reposted the clip on her own account and joked it was her 'max speed PB'.  The Matildas will next week travel to Uzbekistan for the first game of the third and final qualifying round before the Olympics in July. Kerr's father, Roger Kerr, spoke for many football supporters when he said it was 'sad news' that his daughter had again injured her knee. 'It was pretty disappointing, upsetting, so we [have] had a couple of restless nights,' he told Seven News. 'I think she's a bit numb. It's coming up to the Olympics and Olympic qualifiers in February. 'She had a sort of injured World Cup and now we were all looking forward and Australia was looking forward to the Olympics....it's sad news.' Mr Kerr added an ACL injury usually requires '12 months to get right', so 'hopefully in 2025 she can return to the pitch.' He then pointed to her significant workload, which sees her play more than 50 games a year - for Chelsea and Australia. As a unit, the Matildas need to quickly regroup - they face Uzbekistan over a two-legged play-off in February in a bid to qualify for the Olympics.  Kerr, who has often referenced how Cathy Freeman's 2000 Olympic gold medal inspired her as a youngster, featured at both the 2016 and 2020 Olympics. The goal poacher was a key figure as Australia won plenty of admirers after finishing fourth. Her father anticipates she will target the next World Cup and possibly the 2028 Olympics before she hangs up her boots.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Matildas-captain-Sam-Kerr-celebrates-milestone-after%C2%A0horror-ACL-injury/3301615,,2 days ago,all-football-app
7845,Leah Williamson returns to England Women's squad for the first time in 10 months,"Lionesses captain Leah Williamson has returned to Sarina Wiegmanâs 23-player squad, 10 months after rupturing her ACL.  Sarina Wiegman has named her latest squad ahead of the Lionessesâ upcoming friendly matches against Austria and Italy this month. And the biggest talking point ahead of her announcement was whether the England captain, Leah Williamson, would return to the fold. Williamson hasnât played for the Lionesses since she ruptured her ACL in April last year â her last match was a 2-0 defeat against Australia on April 11, a friendly held at Brentfordâs Gtech Community Stadium.

7852,Man Utd 'make Newcastle's Ashworth their top target to become sporting director',"Manchester United have reportedly made Dan Ashworth their top target for their new sporting director - the major hitch being that he currently holds that role at Newcastle.  The Athletic reports that Ashworth is open to joining United and talks are expected to unfold rapidly, although no formal approach has been made. Ashworth, who used to work for Brighton, is highly rated for his recruitment skills but his contract at Newcastle will make negotiations complicated. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS are trying to implement radical change behind the scenes at Old Trafford, having already poached Omar Berrada from Manchester City to be their CEO. Any revamp would benefit considerably from Ashworth, who brings 24 years of experience from Peterborough, Cambridge, West Brom, the FA, Brighton, and Newcastle.  He was technical director at Brighton from spring 2019, helping to oversee a revolution in the club's playing style and recruitment with Graham Potter as manager. Ashworth joined Newcastle after leaving Brighton in June 2022. His departure from the AMEX Stadium saw him put on gardening leave for an extended period of time while Newcastle negotiated his initial move to St James' Park. His role at United would see him have a hands-on relationship with player recruitment, as per The Athletic. Last month, Mail Sport reported that Newcastle were confident they could keep Ashworth, with chief executive Darren Eales emphasising how 'happy' he is with the Toon. Ratcliffe, who completed his Â£1.3billion buy-out of a 25 per cent stake in the club in December, wants to transform football operations. That includes using a data-led approach, chasing younger players in the market, and taking a scythe to Erik ten Hag's influence over transfers. Director of data science Dominic Jordan, who inaugurated the role in 2022, said he expects his field to be 'transformational' for the side. United's current boardroom doesn't boast a sporting director, a decision that has been heavily criticised during a period when the club's recent recruitment has been scrutinised.    Mail Sport has previously reported that current football director John Murtough will leave the club amid an overhaul to their structure. The Premier League still has to ratify Ratcliffe's investment in United, but from there it will be full steam ahead. He has already made a noticeable effort to connect with players and staff, meeting them at Old Trafford and their Carrington training centre. Ratcliffe and INEOS director of sport Sir Dave Brailsford were pictured meeting manager Ten Hag as well as men's team striker Rasmus Hojlund and women's team players Millie Turner, Katie Zelem and Aoife Mannion last month. Ratcliffe and Brailsford also met women's team manager Marc Skinner, plus members of the club's academy sides and performance staff during their visit. They also went to Old Trafford for meetings with the wider club workforce and held an all-staff meeting as they get down to business at United.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Man-Utd-make-Newcastles-Ashworth-their-top-target-to-become-sporting-director/3301591,,2 days ago,all-football-app
7926,Lauren James keen to give Chelsea boss Emma Hayes final season to remember,"Lauren James hopes Chelsea can âachieve good thingsâ in outgoing manager Emma Hayesâ final season in charge of the club. Hayes announced her decision to step down in November and will become the head coach of the United States Womenâs national team at the end of the campaign. Her departure marks the end of a 12-year reign at Chelsea where she has won six Womenâs Super League titles, five FA Cups and two League Cups. James has worked with Hayes since her arrival at the club in 2021 aged 19 and she has since gone on to impress, recently earning the Barclays Player of the Month award in January after scoring five goals in two games. Player of the Month  Manager of the Month. pic.twitter.com/5MGLDvrOEU â Chelsea FC Women (@ChelseaFCW) February 8, 2024 âItâs good working with Emma, our relationship is close as everyone can probably imagine,â James told the PA news agency. âI think highly of her and hopefully we can achieve good things this year together. âIn the moment I was disappointed and it hits you, but thatâs the relationship we have. Itâs football and people move on, Iâll just have to focus on Chelsea.â Jamesâ goalscoring feats last month helped Chelsea cement their spot at the summit of the WSL, where they sit three points clear of second-placed Manchester City ahead of a huge top-of-the-table clash on Friday night. The 22-year-old England forward scored a hat-trick in a 3-1 win against former club Manchester United before bagging a brace in the 3-0 victory against Brighton. Lauren James  James is aiming to continue her form throughout the rest of the season, which sees her in the running for the WSL Golden Boot after scoring 12 goals in as many league games. She said: âIt was a special feeling to receive (the Player of the Month award), I got five goals in two games, so it wasnât that bad of a month! Hopefully I can just continue that form throughout the season.â As well as striving for a fifth successive league title, Chelsea remain in the hunt for trophies in three other competitions in a jam-packed schedule next month. March 3 sees them take on Manchester City in the Continental Tyres League Cup before facing Everton in the FA Cup quarter-finals three days later and they then play Ajax in the Champions League quarter-finals. The Champions League is arguably Chelseaâs more coveted prize and is the one major trophy missing from their impressive collection. They came close in 2021 after finishing as runners-up following a 4-0 defeat to Barcelona in the final and James admits getting far in the competition is the aim. âI think it would be amazing, itâs something that everyone wants and dreams of,â she said. âItâs something this club have been working towards for a while now. Hopefully on Emmaâs final year we can hopefully get that far. âI think (the Champions League) is good experience, the games have been a bit quicker because youâre playing against different opponents from different countries with different styles of play.â",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Lauren-James-keen-to-give-Chelsea-boss-Emma-Hayes-final-season-to-remember/3302181,,1 day ago,all-football-app
8085,Manchester City Women goalkeeper Khiara Keating produces superb performance,"One set-piece, two controversial refereeing decisions and a superb performance by goalkeeper Khiara Keating ensured Manchester Cityâs progress to the FA Cup quarter-finals.  Both teams were chasing their first piece of silverware in some time, with Arsenal having won just one trophy in the last five years. The first half was cagey as the sides kept possession rather than taking a more risky approach that would leave them vulnerable to a counter-attack. City, despite the dynamism of Khadija Shaw, Chloe Kelly and Lauren Hemp, did not register a shot on target. England manager Sarina Wiegman, who was watching in the stands, will have been pleased to see her captain Leah Williamson put in a strong performance in just her second start since returning from an ACL injury. She was Arsenalâs best player for large spells, switching play with pinpoint diagonal passes and clearing a Shaw header off the line. But it was City who finally broke the deadlock in the 73rd minute through a Kelly set-piece. The England international sent her free-kick into the box and the ball fell for Laia Aleixandri, who gratefully poked home. The goal breathed life into the game and Arsenal responded through Beth Mead moments later, who delivered a superb cross to Victoria Pelova. The 24-year-old was unlucky not to find the net, Keating making an excellent save. Keating was called into action again moments later, saving a shot from Kim Little which looked to have crossed the line. But without goal-line technology, City maintained their lead. Another penalty shout from Stina Blackstenius was also waved away. Gunners manager Jonas Eidevall expressed his frustration at the refereeing. He said: âWeâre on the wrong side of the margins. If that ball is over the line or not, if thatâs a penalty or not, those are difficult decisions to deal with right now.â   Arsenal have now suffered back-to-back defeats, having surprisingly lost 1-0 to West Ham last weekend. Elsewhere in the FA Cup, Nottingham Forest were on the end of a 7-1 thumping at home to Everton, who had seven different goalscorers, including an own-goal. Manchester United beat Southampton 3-1. Ella Toone scored an early goal before Lexi Lloyd-Smith levelled, but a late brace from Rachel Williams won it. Brighton beat Wolves 4-1, Emma Kullbergâs first goal of her hat-trick coming in the 88th minute. A goal for Mayra Ramirez eased Chelsea past Crystal Palace and Liverpool beat London City Lionesses 2-0.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Manchester-City-Women-goalkeeper-Khiara-Keating-produces-superb-performance/3300707,,12-Feb,all-football-app
8101,Laia Aleixandri winner sees Man City down Arsenal to reach FA Cup quarter-finals,"Laia Aleixandri earned Manchester City a spot in the Womenâs FA Cup quarter-finals with a second-half winner against Arsenal. The Gunners came into the fifth-round contest hoping to bounce back from a first-ever Womenâs Super League loss to West Ham, but could not find the finishing touch at Meadow Park as they crashed out 1-0. A scrappy first half gave way to a more open second period with chances for both sides, WSL leading goalscorer Khadija Shaw seeing two headed efforts kept out, first by Arsenal keeper Sabrina DâAngelo then by defender Leah Williamson in her second start since returning from a long-term anterior cruciate ligament recovery. Shaw, in a worrying sight for City boss Gareth Taylor, was forced off and replaced by Mary Fowler in the 67th minute, shortly before Gunners substitute Steph Catley failed to clear Chloe Kellyâs free-kick and Spain international Aleixandri pounced, poking in the 74th-minute winner. CITY! CITY! CITY! ð©µ pic.twitter.com/vXEhAVjaMZ â Man City Women (@ManCityWomen) February 11, 2024 Khiara Keatingâs stunning series of saves against a late Arsenal surge preserved the visiting sideâs lead, and while the Gunners felt the City keeper had not saved a last-ditch effort from a scramble before it crossed the line, the officials disagreed. Holders Chelsea took one step closer to securing a fourth straight FA Cup crown with a 1-0 victory over Championship side Crystal Palace at Kingsmeadow thanks a superb maiden goal from January signing Mayra Ramirez. Emma Hayes had initially changed all 11 players from the side that beat Sunderland 5-0 in their midweek Conti Cup clash, but Fran Kirby returned as a replacement for Lauren James, who was a late withdrawal from the line-up. It was a valiant performance from Palace, who held the hosts to a goalless draw for 81 minutes, when Ramirez opened her Blues account with a brilliant backheeled flick to book her side another trip into the last eight. Mayra Ramirez  There were wild scenes at Wolverhampton when Beth Merrickâs 67th-minute penalty for Wolves â one of two third-tier sides remaining â cancelled out Katie Robinsonâs first-half opener for relegation-threatened WSL side Brighton. The teams remained on level terms until Emma Kullbergâs first-ever goal forÂ Brighton fired the Seagulls into an 88th-minute lead, before the Sweden international then completed her hat-trick inside a stunning eight minutes. Manchester United, last seasonâs runners-up, claimed a 3-1 victory over Championship outfit Southampton, with Rachel Williams heading home twice after Lexi Lloyd-Smith had cancelled out Ella Tooneâs eighth-minute opener. Kit Grahamâs low, long-range effort in the 76th minute of Tottenhamâs 1-0 victory over Charlton spelled the end of the Championship leadersâ cup run, while goals from Sophie Roman Haug and Melissa Lawley secured Liverpool a 2-0 win over London City Lionesses.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Laia-Aleixandri-winner-sees-Man-City-down-Arsenal-to-reach-FA-Cup-quarter-finals/3300045,,12-Feb,all-football-app
8107,Chelsea are 'negotiating with Sonia Bompastor' to replace USWNT-bound Emma Hayes,"Chelsea women have identified Lyon head coach Sonia Bompastor as their prime candidate to replace the departing Emma Hayes at the end of the season, according to reports.  The Blues are currently searching for Hayes' replacement after the Englishwoman announced she was leaving the club in the summer to become the new USWNT coach. Bompastor was earmarked as a potential successor early in the process given her achievements as both a player and manager and negotiations are now ongoing, as reported by The Athletic. Her current contract runs until 2025 and Chelsea are working to secure her exit before the end of the existing deal. The French-born manager previously won the Women's Champions League as a player before going on to achieve the same feat as Lyon coach two-years ago.  She was promoted to her current role from within Lyon having previously worked in the club's academy prior to Jean-Luc Vasseur being sacked in 2021. Her first season was rewarded with Lyon winning an outstanding double consisting of the Division 1 Feminine and the Womenâs Champions League where the club beat Barcelona in the final. Bompastor's attack-minded philosophy has resulted in Lyon becoming one of the women game's most-feared teams after previously winning the league with an unbeaten record during her first full season in charge. Hayes and Bompastor are manager's cut from the same cloth after previously working alongside each other in America during their formative coaching years over a decade ago. The current Chelsea boss was on the coaching team at Washington Freedom in the Womenâs Professional Soccer championship, while Bompastor has just joined the newly-formed American team's squad.   Hayes has been incredibly impressed with the 43-year-old since they first met, previously stating before a quarter-final Champions League clash with Lyon: âWhat a brilliant player, honestly. An unbelievable left-back with an unbelievable wand of a left boot. 'I managed to coach her in a team that had Homare Sawa and Abby Wambach. She was just a cultured, brilliant footballer thatâs very quiet, cheeky, funny â the media might not always see that about her. âBut itâs of no surprise to me that her and Camille have done well working together and I said to her at the end of the game last week: âround one, Iâll see you back at Stamford Bridge next weekâ. âThis will be a tough match and we both have a lot of respect for each other and itâs one that Iâm looking forward to even more,' she said at the time.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Chelsea-are-negotiating-with-Sonia-Bompastor-to-replace-USWNT-bound-Emma-Hayes/3301786,,2 days ago,all-football-app
8113,Matildas trio bundled out of Women's FA Cup by Manchester City,"Matildas stars Caitlin Foord, Kyra Cooney-Cross and Steph Catley are out of the Women's FA Cup after Arsenal slumped to a 1-0 fifth-round loss to Manchester City.  The Gunners had been eyeing a response after losing to Mackenzie Arnold and Katrina Gorry's West Ham in the Women's Super League. But Catley in particular had a day to forget, coming off the bench in the 67th minute before her failed clearance seven minutes later opened the door for Spain international Aleixandri to score the winner. Arsenal were then denied over and over by 19-year-old City goalkeeper Khiara Keating's stunning late series of saves. The Gunners were also incensed when they believed the City keeper had not saved a last-ditch effort from a scramble before it crossed the line, but the officials disagreed. 'It's super frustrating, especially when I feel like there were really good moments for us and we were on top, especially that second half,' Foord, who started along with Cooney-Cross, told Optus Sport. 'We created a lot, but all credit to their keeper, she had a 'worldie' today and pulled off some really good saves. 'But we had plenty of chances to get back into the game and stay in it. 'We're playing good football, it's just the results and I guess decisions aren't going our way at times, which is becoming super frustrating.'   Mary Fowler came off the bench for City, replacing injured striker Bunny Shaw in the 67th minute. Alanna Kennedy was brought on in injury-time to close out the game and seal progression to the quarter-finals. Arsenal, who sit third in the WSL, will turn their focus to a League Cup quarter-final against the London City Lionesses, before a league blockbuster against Manchester United. 'They're massive games and we know the challenge ahead,' Foord said. 'We can't drop points from now on. 'We want to win that trophy in the (League) Cup and give ourselves the best chance in the league and that's to win every game from now on and just focus on ourselves 'I guess it's in our hands now to stay in it.' Sam Kerr's replacement at Chelsea, Colombia forward Mayra Ramirez, scored her first goal for her new club to steer the Blues to a 1-0 win over Crystal Palace. Ramirez, signed after Kerr tore her ACL, scored a wonderful back-heel flick in the 81st minute to secure passage to the quarter-finals.

If Tony Gustavsson's side beat Uzbekistan later this month in a two-legged play-off for a spot at this year's Olympics, the match against the Latin Americans in the US will be crucial ahead of the Games in Paris come July 26. Gustavsson said he was excited to face the world No.35 team. 'When I started with the Matildas we identified the need to continue challenging ourselves against different types of styles, opponents and experiencing high quality matches that allows us to strive to get one day better,' he said. 'Every match we schedule is deliberate and are key to our bigger picture of preparing the team for global tournaments and to take on the best teams in the world.   'With quality players across the park, where many play their club football with top teams, Mexico is certainly an opponent that will offer strong competition, and the knowledge we will gain from the questions they ask will boost our team.' Australia and Mexico have played on nine previous occasions, with the Matildas having won eight and lost just once since their first meeting back in 2003. Meanwhile, Matildas trio Caitlin Foord, Kyra Cooney-Cross and Steph Catley are out of the Women's FA Cup after Arsenal slumped to a 1-0 fifth-round loss to Manchester City on Monday.

8142,Haller made incredible comeback by scoring Ivory Coast winner for AFCON victory,"In the world of professional football, where the spotlight shines brightest on the pitch, the news of a player being diagnosed with cancer sends shockwaves through the entire sporting community.  Yet, amidst the darkness of such news, there are stories that provide hope and inspiration. From Jonas Gutierrez's courageous battle with testicular cancer to Stiliyan Petrov's inspiring comeback from acute leukemia, each story is a testament to those athletes. Inspired by the recent journey of Sebastian Haller, who bravely battled cancer, reclaimed his place on the pitch and scored the winner for Ivory Coast at AFCON, this feature shines a spotlight on footballers who have faced similar challenges. From the depths of diagnosis to the heights of recovery and return, Mail Sport have rounded up the individual that exemplify courage, perseverance, and the unwavering determination to defy the odds.  Bournemouth winger David Brooks was diagnosed with Stage 2 Hodgkin lymphoma, a rare form of blood cancer that affects the white blood cells, in October 2021. But after undergoing 18 months of treatment for the disease, Brooks was given the all clear in May 2022. He said: 'It has been a few months since my last update and in that time I have thankfully completed my cancer treatment. I would like to say a huge thank you to all of the incredible medical staff for their amazing work and support throughout the process. 'Last week I met with my specialist having reviewed my final test results. I am delighted to say the treatment was successful and I can now say that I have been given the all clear and am now cancer free. 'Those words feel incredible to say and I am so thankful for all your messages and good wishes, these really helped me through the tough times.' Brooks was named in Gary O'Neil's starting XI for the first time in 598 days when Bournemouth faced Manchester United in May 2023. He had made four appearances off the bench since March but said he was beyond excited to start a game.  Jonas Gutierrez was diagnosed with cancer in October 2013 and underwent surgery in December. The midfielder was given the all-clear after a year and returned to action to help Newcastle avoid relegation. However, Gutierrez was frustrated with how his cancer diagnosis was handled.  He claimed he was forced to pay for his treatment and said he was told by the former Newcastle manager, Alan Pardew, that he would no longer feature in 'Newcastle's plans'. Gutierrez, who had been at the forefront of the Newcastle squad, said he was shocked at the 'sudden change of heart' and that the situation caused him a lot of 'distress'. He said: 'I believe that the reason for this was due to my cancer diagnosis and very recent operation to remove the tumour, as I had clearly been a crucial part of Newcastle's first team lineup to this point. 'I think they feared that my illness would mean that I could no longer play at the highest level and they considered me to be a liability rather than an asset to the club. 'I got the impression that they thought I couldn't be the same player again after such an illness or that I would be bound to have lingering effects other episodes of illness off the back of it. This caused me a lot of distress given my hard work and commitment for the club in the preceding five and half years.' As a result, Gutierrez launched a Â£2million disability discrimination claim against the club, saying they dropped him from the team because of his battle with cancer.  Stiliyan Petrov was diagnosed with Leukemia in 2012. He spent five years building himself back up after undergoing 13 months of treatment. Speaking about his diagnosis, Petrov said: 'It came from nowhere. My football, my dreams, all of it taken away from me. Everything I had planned for, everything that I thought would happen, everything that I wanted to achieve disappeared in a single second. 'I had to put everything on the side. And what I had to do was battle for my life. My battle was to survive. A battle to still be a human being, still be a father, still be a husband, still be somebody who wants to achieve more after the football. But I could not.' Petrov did try to return to football and even looked for a new deal with Aston Villa. However, it never came off and he decided to hang up his boots despite being touted for a return in 2016.  Arjen Robben was just 20-years-old when he found a lump on the his left testicle. The Dutch winger underwent surgery to remove the unwanted lump and returned to football soon after. Speaking about his diagnosis after recovering from cancer, Robben said: 'I was very scared - it was a very difficult time. I found a little lump and went to the doctor. He told me I needed an operation. I then had to wait for the results and I didn't know if it was going to be good or bad news. 'The waiting was terrible for a few days. I didn't know what was going to happen to me. It was a horrible wait, then I heard the news was good and it was a massive relief. 'At that time football was no longer important - the most important thing is to be healthy and for your family to be healthy. Football is my life but my family's health is the most important thing in the world.'  Abidal's remarkable story began in March 2011. He was 31 and in his fourth season as a powerful defender for Pep Guardiola's Barcelona when he went to hospital for routine medical tests. Abidal told Mail Sport: 'I felt in good health. My fitness scores were high. I'd always looked after my body. When they told me I had a tumour in my liver, I got a huge shock. He went on to add: 'But this can happen to anyone, whatever your age, whatever your job. You can have all the money in the world but nothing prepares you for cancer.' Abidal had an operation and, incredibly, returned to the first-team fold within six weeks. Only 71 days had passed since the operation when 'Abi' played his first 90 minutes - in the 3-1 victory over Manchester United in the Champions League final at Wembley. 'That game was an obsession for me. I was determined to get myself right. Pep was amazing, sending me messages saying, ""Keep going, we are all counting on you to be there"".'  Former Union Berlin defender Timo Baumgartl was diagnosed with cancer in May 2022 after a tumour was found during a routine check-up. When asked about his diagnosis, Baumgartl said: 'When you're given the cancer diagnosis you're forced to think about what it would be like if you're no longer around.' Thankfully, Baumgartl recovered from cancer after undergoing surgery and several rounds of chemotherapy. He also returned to football five months later - starting Union Berlin's clash with Wolfsburg (which they ended up winning 2-0 to put them top of the table). Baumgartl was overcome with emotion after the final whistle and said the following in his post-match interview: 'This is exactly what I dreamed about the whole time during my chemotherapy: to come back into the starting line-up and to win.'  Francesco Acerbi was diagnosed with testicular cancer in June 2013 and underwent treatment to get rid of the disease. However, he found out it had returned in December later that year. Acerbi continued to battle back against the disease and was given the all clear before going on to make his international debut for Italy in 2014. 'With everything I went through, I am happy and proud, but I have objectives and when I've reached them I will be satisfied. What are they? I won't tell,' Acerbi told Rai Sport after the match. 'If you want to reach your targets, then you need to work hard, sweat and have that hunger within you. If you don't have it in you, then it's impossible to get there.'  Borussia Monchengladbach defender Stefan Lainer was diagnosed with lymphoma in July 2023. The 31-year-old, who had made 125 appearances for the German club at the time, needed to stop playing and undergo treatment for the cancer. However, Lainer - who was ever-present in his first two seasons in Germany after completing a move from Austrian top-flight outfit Red Bull Salzburg in 2019 - did say the cancer had been detected 'extremely early' and that it was treatable with medication. Thankfully, Lainer made a full recovery and returned to training just over two months ago - with the Bundesliga giants releasing the following statement. 'Stefan Lainer is set to return to training for Borussia Monchengladbach. The right-back, who was diagnosed with lymphoma in July, has successfully completed the therapy that he had been undertaking over the past few months. A recent final examination showed that therapy had been successful for Lainer and that he had been cured of lymphoma.' While Lainer added: 'I'm thrilled that I can once again fully concentrate on football and train together with the team. The last weeks and months were a big challenge. I'm very thankful to have had so much support from my family, my friends, the club and the fans during this period. 'All this gave me strength. In particular, I would like to thank my wife and Dr. Sellmann, who were the most important sources of support during this time.'  Henri Lansbury was diagnosed with testicular cancer during his time at Nottingham Forest. Speaking on Sky Sports, Lansbury said: 'I was in the shower after training one day and was obviously having a feel as I was washing myself and I felt a lump. It was a little pea-sized lump. 'Over time I thought it would go away but a couple months passed and it was still there. We broke up for the summer, about to go on holiday... but it was eating me away for a few months. 'Obviously having it, not telling anyone and just trying to deal with it myself. And it came to the point where I thought I had to see someone and someone had to help me out. 'First of all, I just went down to the local hospital to see if I could get it checked out. But they said the lead time was a few weeks. Obviously, going on holiday, I didn't want to go away with it. 'So I had to phone the club and ask for help. They put me in contact with someone to go get it checked out. Had a scan there and he said 'alright we'll give you your results in a bit'. 'As I've left to get in my car, the doctor from Nottingham Forest has called me and said: 'Go and pack a bag. You're going back in for the operation tonight. It was a bit fast but glad to get it out'.  Linda Caicedo started feeling pain in her abdomen during the Covid-19 pandemic. After several tests, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. At just 15-years-old, Caicedo underwent surgery to remove a tumour and one of her ovaries. The surgery was successful and Caicedo returned to training with her club Deportivo Cali just days after her final round of chemotherapy. She went on to thrive at club level before being handed her international just three years after her diagnosis. The teenage star even scored on her debut to help Colombia secure a 2-0 win over South Korea in their Women's World Cup match in Sydney.  'At the time, I didn't think I could play professionally again because of all the treatments and surgeries I had to go through,' Caicedo told FIFA. 'Mentally, it was a very difficult moment in my life.' 'I'm forever grateful that it happened when I was very young. I was able to recover, I also had my family's support and I feel very good now. What happened made me grow. I feel thankful and happy to be here.'",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Haller-made-incredible-comeback-by-scoring-Ivory-Coast-winner-for-AFCON-victory/3300919,,13-Feb,all-football-app
8164,Footballers inside the ring: Man Utd legend Roy Keane went UNDEFEATED,"To make it to the highest levels as a professional footballer, stamina, discipline and work ethic are essential attributes.  When combined with the kind of natural athleticism also seen in fighters, it is perhaps not surprising that, throughout the years, there have been crossovers from the pitch to the ring. Wherever it is formative years spent in an amateur gym, a charity fight after retirement, or a full-blown career change, several footballers have tested their skills in the sweet science. For better or worse these players stepped away from the protection of a team game, and challenged themselves in one of sport's most unforgiving avenues. With the news that Wayne Rooney is debating stepping into the world of influencer boxing to sign with KSI's Misfits promotion, we took a look back at eight players who tried their hand at boxing. Renowned as one of England's greatest-ever defensive talents, Rio Ferdinand enjoyed a glittering career across two decades as a professional footballer. The centre-back twice broke the British transfer record, and upon arrival at Old Trafford in 2002 quickly established himself as one of the club's stalwarts in the latter years of Sir Alex Ferguson's all-conquering reign. After more than a decade in Manchester, Ferdinand endured a decidedly less successful year at QPR before calling time on his career in 2015. Although that retirement marked the end of his football career, Ferdinand's sporting ambitions found a new venture in professional boxing. Aged 39, in 2017 Ferdinand announced he would transition to boxing with a documentary set to be filmed following his transition to a career in combat sports. Less than a year after embarking on a training regime, Ferdinand was denied a license to box by the British Boxing Board of Control and retired without stepping inside the ring, and has since flourished on screens as a pundit, appearing most regularly on TNT Sport.  Joining his former Manchester United team-mate on this list, Wayne Rooney could yet step into the ring this year if negotiations with Misfits boxing prove fruitful. Unlike Ferdinand however, Rooney does have a background in pugilism, having trained in the sport as a youth before becoming a teenage sensation at Everton. Despite his various successes in football Rooney's love of boxing never wavered during his career, and he was frequently spotted at high-profile fights and maintained a close friendship with Ricky Hatton. But the former United captain's love of the sport infamously wasn't limited to just spectating. In 2015, footage emerged of Rooney being knocked unconscious whilst sparring in his kitchen with former United teammate Phil Bardsley. Rooney saw the funny side though, parodying the incident with a notorious goal celebration after netting just days later against Tottenham.  The recipient of 36 England caps, Wayne Bridge would have no doubt won countless more had his sporting prime not seen him forced to compete with Ashley Cole for a place in the national team. Having won everything available to him domestically at Chelsea, Bridge would spend time at Manchester City, West Ham, Sunderland, Brighton and Reading before hanging up his boots in 2014. Despite his career on the pitch being over, Bridge remained active and elected to showcase his budding skills inside the ring for charity at Sport Relief 2018. Taking on reality TV personality Spencer Matthews, Bridge dominated his hapless opponent and twice forced the Made In Chelsea star to the canvas. While Matthews would survive to see the final bell, Bridge dominated and was rightfully declared the winner after three two-minute rounds.  Known for his intensity, aggression and seemingly-endless stamina it is perhaps no surprise that Roy Keane briefly donned the gloves in his youth. Taking up the sport aged nine, Keane followed his brother into a local amateur boxing gym in Cork. While his brother went full-steam ahead with training, the younger Keane was forced to juggle his boxing commitments with a burgeoning football career for local side Rockmount. Though his stint in the ring was short-lived Roy did have several amateur fights, winning all of them before concentrating on his football. Speaking about the experience on Sky's Stick to Football podcast Keane expressed his love for the sport. 'My brother had about 50 amateur fights but I had about four fights. I was unbeaten, you know what I mean. It was great, brilliant when you were younger with training, I loved everything about it and the discipline.'  Much like Keane, Tommy Martin was once faced with a decision as to whether to continue his footballing career or seriously pursue boxing. The Chelmsford-born light-welterweight was on the books at Peterborough United after emerging as a talented young goalkeeper. However, despite being offered a scholarship by the Posh, Martin knew his true affections lay elsewhere. 'As soon as I stepped into the gym, I thought 'I don't want to be on a cold, muddy football pitch - I want to be in the gym punching someone's head in'. Martin told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire. Making his professional debut in 2012, Martin would soon be recognised as one of Britain's premier talents at 140lbs defeating Ricky Boylan for the English title in 2015 becoming the youngest fighter in history to capture the belt. His in-ring career would ultimately end in tragedy, however. Just one year after his historic title win Martin faced John Wayne Hibbert for the Commonwealth belt and was knocked out in the twelfth and final round of a back-and-forth clash. Martin suffered a bleed on the brain during the bout, and was subsequently forced to retire from the sport.  Unquestionably the most successful fighter to feature on this list, Katie Taylor has combined an unprecedentedly successful amateur run with multiple world titles as a professional. However, before any of her boxing successes the 37-year-old's first showcase on the international stage came as a midfielder. After playing the sport as a schoolgirl, Taylor played for various sides in the Dublin area and represented the Republic or Ireland at multiple youth levels. Taylor then went on to make 11 appearances for the senior side, scoring for her country in their Euro 2009 qualifying clashes with Italy and Hungary. Domestically Taylor also won a treble with Peamount United as the club triumphed in the Dublin Women's Soccer League, the DWSL Premier Cup and the FAI Women's Cup in 2010. All the while she was carving out a career as one of the most decorated amateurs in the history of women's boxing, counting an Olympic gold amongst her numerous titles before turning pro in 2016.  Unlike some of his contemporaries on this list, when Leon McKenzie opted to embark on a boxing career after hanging up his boots, he did it the hard way. An industrious forward that netted in all four divisions of English football, McKenzie was an integral member of Nigel Worthington's Norwich side that was promoted to the Premier League in 2004, netting nine times in just 12 starts. Once in the top-flight McKenzie would register a further seven goals as the Canaries' joint-top scorer but the club couldn't avoid relegation at the first attempt. After briefly dropping into non-league football McKenzie decided on a career change, and went on to make his professional boxing debut aged 35 in 2013. Initially cutting his teeth against journeymen, McKenzie shortly progressed up the ranks and earned a shot at the English super-middleweight title with a first-round stoppage of Kelvin Young. Though he would ultimately be unsuccessful in his pursuit of domestic glory, McKenzie's 8-2-1 record is unquestionably respectable, particularly given his age when he first laced up the gloves.  While Curtis Woodhouse may not be the best footballer to feature on this list, nor the most accomplished fighter, his accomplishments in both earn him the title as one of football's greatest boxers. Beginning his career with York, Woodhouse would soon be snapped up by Sheffield United, making his senior debut with the Blades in 1997 before going on to join Birmingham.  In the West Midlands Woodhouse would make 28 appearances in the 2001-02 season as Steve Bruce led the club to fifth in the Championship, though he would be left out of the squad as they defeated Norwich on penalties in the play-off final. Though his opportunities would prove limited in the top flight, Woodhouse did make several substitute appearances in the Premier before departing St Andrew's in search of more playing time. Spells at Peterborough, Hull and Grimsby followed though he later stated he had 'fallen out of love with football' and opted to move to a career in the ring aged 26. Initially accused of being little more than a gimmick, Woodhouse soon proved himself by winning multiple domestic titles, including the British light-welterweight belt before retiring in 2017 with  a record of 24 wins and 7 losses.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Footballers-inside-the-ring-Man-Utd-legend-Roy-Keane-went-UNDEFEATED/3302510,,18 hours ago,all-football-app
8201,Chelsea boss Emma Hayes reveals how her son made her decision to take USA job,"Chelsea manager Emma Hayes said she decided to take the USWNT managerâs role only after receiving âendorsementâ from her five-and-a-half-year old son Harry.  The long-time Blues boss called an end on her more than 11-year tenure with the club earlier this season to become the new head coach of the four-time world champions. The Hayes era at Chelsea has been defined by unprecedented and sustained domestic success at the club, with the 47-year-old claiming 13 major trophies, including six Womenâs Super League titles. And Hayes has revealed that when she was tucking her son into bed earlier this year, she presented him with the opportunity to swap London for the USA. âI asked him, âMummyâs got the chance to go and coach the USA team or we can stay here?â and his reaction really helped me,â Hayes told the Telegraph. âI didnât know what he was going to say, but he smiled, he hugged me, he kissed me and he said, âLetâs go to the USA, Mummy, Iâm really excited, I want to go to the USA!â and I almost couldnât believe it. That was it, that was the endorsement I needed.â Since announcing her departure, Hayes has stressed the importance of family in her decision to leave west London, emphasising how she desired to pick Harry up from school and spend less hours travelling to and from work. The timing of the conversations with US Soccer over the vacancy following former manager Vlatko Adanovskiâs sacking after a torrid Womenâs World Cup showing also played a role as the approaches for the role arrived shortly after Hayesâ father, Sid, passed away at age 82. âTruthfully, I was grieving, and I couldnât think of anything else. I didnât have any feeling at that point,â Hayes said. âSo, I just felt like it was hard to make a life-changing decision, at a time that just didnât feel right, so reaching that decision with almost a compromise to start at the end of this season was, I think, the only way I could have done it.â News of Hayesâ departure was equally shocking and foreseeable, as Hayes has spoken at length of the exacting demands of elite-level coaching. The Chelsea manager revealed her plans to leave to an emotional dressing room following their 6-0 win over Aston Villa last November. âIt was a silent dressing room. It was very reflective,â said Hayes. âThere was shock. But for me, too, it wasnât just them. The players were happy for me, because they knew how much Harry meant, and how much Iâve sacrificed. And at the same time it was sad, because change was coming and that familiarity was about to end. âBut that feeling passed. The team have adapted, and theyâre all excited for their future with a new coach. Itâs important to keep mentioning that. Theyâve had one voice for 11 years, not all of them, but itâs time, too, for them to have a different type of leader and a different type of learning, and vice-versa for me.â Since Hayesâ announcement, Chelsea have lost only one game in and are still fighting on all four fronts, including the Womenâs Champions League which is the one trophy which has eluded Hayes in her splendid tenure.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Chelsea-boss-Emma-Hayes-reveals-how-her-son-made-her-decision-to-take-USA-job/3302604,,18 hours ago,all-football-app
8249,WSL seeks bids for Â£20m annual TV contract to show all matches live next season,"Every Womenâs Super League game is set to be broadcast live from next season in a historic first for football in this country.  Mail Sport has learned that the WSL tender document issued to broadcasters this month features all 132 league games, with 56 to be sold exclusively and the remaining 76 available on a non-exclusive basis. The WSL have not secured the 3pm Saturday slot demanded by Karen Carney in her womenâs football review as they have yet to get agreement from the Premier League and EFL to pursue a revision on the UEFA blackout, with Saturday lunchtime and Sunday afternoons remaining as the most common kick-off times. In an attempt to gain an increase from the existing Â£7.75million-a-year deal the WSL have responded by making every match available for broadcast, which it is hoped will attract bids from beyond current rights holders Sky Sports and the BBC. Under the terms of the existing deal that expires in the summer Sky broadcast 35 matches-a-season and the BBC 22, with the rest streamed for free on the FAâs website.   Sky contribute around Â£7m of the current contract and during initial discussions are understood to have argued that the value of the WSL has not risen significantly despite the huge growth in interest in womenâs football, a view supported by their subscription and advertising data. The WSL are understood to be seeking a new TV contract worth between Â£15m and Â£20m-a-year, and have reached the conclusion that their best way of doubling their money is to sell every game. The strategy is similar to that which saw the National Womenâs Soccer League in the United States secure a remarkable Â£50m-a-year deal last year by selling packages to four different broadcasters. The WSLâs tactics also mirror those used successfully by the Premier League and EFL to secure bigger TV deals in recent years, albeit taken to extremes.    From next season a staggering 1059 of the 1891 matches in the EFL will be broadcast live on Sky, while from the 2025/26 campaign 270 of the 380 Premier League games will be televised live. Sky are also televising every Super League fixture live for the first time in the new season which begins this week, although some will be shared with the BBC. Sky and the BBC are set to bid again, while TNT and DAZN have also expressed interest in securing some of the packages.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/WSL-seeks-bids-for-%C2%A320m-annual-TV-contract-to-show-all-matches-live-next-season/3301949,,1 day ago,all-football-app

""It was without bad faith at a time of maximum effusiveness."" The incident took place as Rubiales presented gold medals to the Spanish team after their 1-0 victory over England in the final.

The incident has sparked discussions around consent and gender issues in Spain. The country's government has made significant legal reforms concerning gender change, abortion, and sex work.

The acting Gender Equality Minister, Irene Montero, emphasised that non-consensual actions should not be normalised.    Despite the controversy, Hermoso has expressed her desire to focus on her achievement as a world champion, indicating her wish for the attention to shift away from the incident. Rubiales, who initially dismissed the outrage as the work of ""idiots"", later extended his apology also to those who had called him out for his actions.

8304,Chelsea 3-0 Everton: Guro Reiten scores two penalties in controversial Women's Super League victory,"Chelsea regained top spot in the Women's Super League thanks to two controversial penalties scored by Guro Reiten and a clinical finish from Erin Cuthbert in a 3-0 victory over Everton. Manchester City had temporarily moved above the Blues after beating Leicester earlier on Sunday, but Emma Hayes' side were ruthless as Mayra Ramirez made her first start since joining the club for a British-record fee of £385k. Everton were harshly undone in the first half when Clare Wheeler was punished for winning the ball ahead of Johanna Rytting Kaneryd in the penalty area. Reiten stepped up and found the bottom left corner beyond the reach of goalkeeper Courtney Brosnan. Then, with less than 20 minutes to play, Wheeler was again penalised after Ramirez went down in the box and Reiten made no mistake again. Everton manager Brian Sorensen was sent off for dissent moments before Cuthbert volleyed in the third to move Chelsea three points clear. Reiten had the first Chelsea chance from a smart Ramirez cross but was unable to beat Brosnan, who soon parried a delivery into the box against the upright with Wheeler clearing off the line. Wheeler was then punished for her good work in the Everton box as Reiten took full advantage from the penalty spot.

Sorensen showed his frustrations late on which were compounded by a lovely Chelsea move that Cuthbert rounded off with a clinical volley. Everton assistant manager Stephen Neligan told Sky Sports: ""Scoreline aside, there are lots of positives we can take from the performance. There are still a lot of things we can improve on. ""We came in at half-time and knew we had the wind behind us in the second half so were optimistic about what we could have got out of it. The first 15, 20 minutes of the second half we were happy and then the quality of Chelsea started to hurt some of our mistakes."" On penalty decisions: ""It's hard to see from where I was standing. I've seen the replay of the second one which could have gone either way. You could say both of them were hard done by but it is what it is. ""The game has ultimately been decided on decisions like that, that could go either way.""

I can't fault the players though, they want to win, they want to play well, I thought our quality did show through in the second half. ""Our issue in the first half was our impatience in possession that created the transitions between both teams, but yes, happy all around. ""We deserved to win the game. I have never seen us get two penalties in a game before, so that's a first! And a good debut for Mayra Ramirez."" On penalty decisions: ""I haven't watched it [the first one].

8314,Chelsea: Emma Hayes says Blues are in the least advantageous position to retain the Women's Super League title,"Emma Hayes says progression in the Champions League puts Chelsea in ""the least advantageous position"" to retain the Women's Super League title.

""I've always said, for many years, the team that's in the latter stages of the Champions League is in the least advantageous position to win the league,"" Hayes said, speaking in her press conference ahead of the visit of second-placed Manchester City to Kingsmeadow on Friday night. ""Go and look at our calendar in March, April and May and you'll see we've got a game every three days until the end. We're competing on four fronts. ""Of course, it's where we want to be, but don't think for one minute that volume of games puts us at an advantage, whether we win or not on Friday. I think we are exactly where we want to be.

8355,Arsenal stunned by West Ham turnaround as Man Utd beat Brighton - Women's Super League round-up,"West Ham came from behind to dent Arsenal's Women's Super League title hopes with a stunning 2-1 victory. Jonas Eidevall's side had been on course to close the gap on leaders Chelsea at the Chigwell Construction Stadium with captain Leah Williamson making her first start since returning from injury, but after she was substituted at half-time as part of her return to full fitness, the Gunners conceded twice within 15 minutes of the second half and could not recover. Alessia Russo had headed Arsenal into a deserved lead at the end of the first half which also saw Vivianne Miedema strike the West Ham crossbar. However, the game changed in the 50th minute when Stephanie Catley was adjudged to have brought down Riko Ueki just inside the box and Viviane Asseyi kept her cool from the penalty spot, sending goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger the wrong way. Zinsberger was then at fault eight minutes later as West Ham took the lead. Her punch at a free-kick was poor and fell to centre-back Hawa Cissoko, who impressively turned the ball back past the goalkeeper and into the net. Arsenal pushed hard for an equaliser, racking up 23 shots in total, with Russo firing over when well positioned in the box and appeals for a penalty on substitute Cloe Lacasse were waved away as West Ham held on for their first home win in 12 matches.

Across the weekend of February 2-5, clubs will take centre stage as part of Green Football Weekend, taking part in greener games to showcase their sustainability work, engaging fans in the issue and announcing new, more ambitious commitments. The world's largest climate-football campaign mobilises fans, clubs, leagues and partners to take action on climate.

The future of football is at risk due to the effects of climate change, with 150,000 games already cancelled per year due to pitch flooding. By 2050, a quarter of UK football grounds will be flooded, with one in four teams expecting partial or total stadium flooding each year. From January 18 to February 5, fans can go to greenfootballweekend.com to score green goals for their football club, by pledging to make a green switch or taking a green action. Every green goal fans score will help their club climb up the leader board to help them win the Green Football Cup.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Forest Green Rovers chairman Dale Vince on why he is supporting Green Football Weekend: When I first got involved with Forest Green Rovers it was about to run out of money. I saw what it meant to the local community and so I stepped in to make it financially sustainable, because I didn't want to see it fold. I had to make a lot of changes, to align the club with my environmental principles and in that I saw the opportunity to do something much bigger. It was a chance to talk to an entirely new audience about the environment. This would most definitely not be preaching to the choir - and that added to the appeal. Now Forest Green Rovers is known as the greenest football club in the world. We've shown there's another way to do football, but the aim isn't to be the exception. Every football club should be a green football club. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  That's what Green Football Weekend is all about and that's why I'm backing it. Green Football Weekend is a campaign that unleashes the power of football to tackle climate change, bringing together clubs, fans and communities to have fun and take action on climate. It's simple - Football is a big cultural force. It's the biggest sport in the world reaching billions of passionate fans. And football fans take notice of what their clubs and stars do. If we can harness some of that passion and point it towards the environment, we can create change on the scale needed - from the grass roots if you like. I've seen it work at FGR where our fans have embraced the green agenda of the club. Football fans can easily make changes that reduce their own impact, and football is a great way to communicate with them and show them how. We have woven sustainability into the DNA of FGR and we created a new kind of football club - one where the environment and football have equal importance - and a new kind of football fan as a consequence. Last year Green Football Weekend reached over 30 million fans and in February 2024 we're going even bigger, with more than 80 clubs across the top leagues getting involved. It's driven by an amazing set of partners including Sky Sports, TNT Sports and the Football Supporters Association, and is backed by the FA, EFL and WSL. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It's happening from the 2nd to the 5th of February and the focus is food. Because what we eat matters. It matters for our health and for the health of the planet. It's one of the biggest and easiest ways for fans and clubs to make a difference, but there are also loads of benefits to eating less meat and more veg, from preventing injuries to improving recovery times. And it tastes great too - just ask our fans at FGR where food sales are something like 10 times higher than before we went plant based. We've certainly been on a journey with food at FGR. We've been fully vegan since 2014 but we didn't do it overnight. It was a gradual process and we took our fans with us. It's one many areas where they've embraced another way of doing things. Now it's probably what we're known for most and it's been fun. It was at Wembley at the full-time whistle when we were promoted to the football league, that BBC commentator Bob Hunt minted his legendary quote live on air when he exclaimed, 'Swindon, Cheltenham, Bristol Rovers, let me tell you this, next season you'll be eating hummus because Forest Green Rovers are in the Football League.' Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  That was fun and felt like a big win, given the scepticism and ridicule at the outset. But the bigger wins on this front have been when visiting fans like our food so much they ask their own clubs to change the menu. The proof of the pudding if you like. I know it can feel a bit challenging to some people, to contemplate plant based food, I've seen it - I like to point out that chips are vegan, it surprises a surprising amount of people. Plant based food is quite normal. But while clubs and their fans can make a huge difference, we can't leave it to them alone. We need the government to do their bit too. That's why we're is calling for the new independent football regulator to be responsible for environmental sustainability as well as financial sustainability. Both of these issues are vital to football and we can't properly have one without the other. Along with the whole of the Green Britain Group, I'm backing Green Football Weekend. So, come February 2nd, when you join me on the terraces, think about what you're eating and how you can do your bit for the planet. And if all else fails, just get some chips.

""It is also alleged that Brian Sorensen acted in an improper manner and used abusive and/or insulting words towards a match official during the 79th minute, which led to his dismissal."" Everton and Sorensen both have until Friday February 9 to provide their responses.

""So he tried to change the sub cards. I understand it, he didn't have the depth, but they didn't let him and he got irate and took a yellow.

8392,Michael Mellon: Dundee raise 'serious concerns' with Scottish FA after striker suffers serious head injury,"Dundee have contacted the Scottish FA with ""serious concerns"" about play not being stopped to allow treatment to Michael Mellon after he suffered a head injury against St Johnstone. The on-loan Burnley striker was stretchered off after a challenge from Liam Gordon in stoppage time at Dens Park on Sunday. Dundee manager Tony Docherty accused Saints captain Liam Gordon of being guilty of an ""almost life-endangering"" challenge on the substitute. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Docherty also questioned why referee David Munro did not stop play immediately. ""For me, that was almost life-endangering that challenge,"" he said after the 2-1 win. ""And to not even get a booking for it... ""Michael is a top boy in our team and I'm concerned for him because he took a really bad blow to the back of the head.

""The club is today writing to the Scottish FA in the strongest terms to express its serious concerns that play was not stopped to allow immediate attention to Michael after what was clearly a dreadful head clash. ""Michael sustained a significant head injury in yesterday's match against St Johnstone, but thanks to the swift intervention by Dr McCormack and the medical team, his condition was stabilised and he was transferred to Ninewells Hospital Accident and Emergency Department.

8409,Chelsea to face Ajax in Women's Champions League quarter-finals as Emma Hayes makes Star Wars revelation,"Chelsea will face Ajax in the Women's Champions League quarter-finals, and could set up another semi-final tie against Barcelona. The Blues were unbeaten in their group stage campaign, winning four and drawing two games in Group D as they finished top of their table ahead of BK Hacken. Now, they face Ajax. The Dutch side had reached the Champions League group stage for the first time in its current iteration in the women's game. The first legs will be played on either March 19 or 20 with the second legs the following week on March 27 or 28. The winners will face the victors of the quarter-final between SK Brann and Barcelona. Should the Women's Super League and LigaF sides be successful, it will be the second year in a row that Chelsea and Barcelona will meet in the final four. Last year, Barcelona were 2-1 winners on aggregate. They won 1-0 at Stamford Bridge in the first leg before a 1-1 draw in the return fixture saw them through. Barcelona also beat Chelsea 4-0 in the 2021 Champions League final - the first time the Blues had reached the showpiece match. Stream the WSL and more with NOW Get Sky Sports Women's Super League video Latest Sky Sports podcasts The first legs of the Champions League semi-finals will be played on April 20 and 21, and the second legs a week later on April 27 and 28 2024. The European trophy remains the one title that eludes Chelsea manager Emma Hayes, who is departing the club at the end of the season after 12 successful years. When she first announced her departure, Hayes said of the Champions League: ""It would be a fairy tale to win it, of course. But I didn't grow up liking fairy tales - my sister did. ""I would love nothing more than to be in a winning position with this team."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Hayes says she is not thinking about a dream quadruple to crown her time in charge. ""No, I don't think about it,"" she said at her press conference on Tuesday. ""Most of the time I just dream about getting through the day. I don't preoccupy my mind thinking about it. We're where we want to be today and that's all I can ask of the squad."" On the Champions League draw, Hayes added: ""Ajax are a really good team. We watched them in a pre-season game last year. They're a young group coming through and it's as tough a game as we could expect from a quarter-final. It's going to be tough going away from home in the first leg. We'll need to use all our power and experience. They're a top team and deserve to be where they are. ""We would never, ever be disrespectful to Ajax. They're an excellent team and my focus is on my team being ready for that away leg [not thinking about facing Barcelona] next."" SK Brann vs Barcelona Benfica vs Lyon Ajax vs Chelsea BK Hacken vs PSG SK Brann or Barcelona vs Ajax or Chelsea Benfica or Lyon vs BK Hacken or PSG Hayes has revealed her love of Star Wars as she described the sci-fi franchise as having messages that are ""so essential in life"". Hayes' side, in what will be their final campaign under her before she steps down to take charge of the United States national team, are navigating a busy schedule with Wednesday's League Cup quarter-final against Sunderland their sixth game in 18 days. And when asked at a press conference ahead of the tie if the fact it is the last season of her tenure gave her extra energy, the 47-year-old gave an unexpected response. ""To be honest with you The Force Awakens, that gave me a lot of inspiration last night,"" Hayes said with a smile. ""And I'm certain the resistance continue to inspire, and we can keep at bay that evil empire. And for now, all I'm thinking about is I need to get on to The Mandalorian."" Hayes, who has a five-year-old son, was later asked if she watched Star Wars with the eyes of a football manager, and she said: ""I think the messages throughout Star Wars, now I'm watching it as an adult, are so essential in life, about the power of love and the dangers of hate. ""And teaching a five-year-old why it's important not to give into hate…When we have our light sabre moments - I'm pretty good on the light sabre, I'm always Darth Vader which slightly annoys me - I constantly remind him of the importance of community and looking after your people, much like the resistance did. ""And as he always says to me, the republic will remain intact as long as we defeat the evil empire. ""So, yes, essence of the message, always have skilled finishers like the Jedi knights, have the ability to deliver a fatal hit into the Death Star. ""Without doubt, we wouldn't be anywhere without Luke Skywalker, so all my thanks are there for him and the entire Jedi knights.""

8410,South Asians in Football Weekly: Singh lands Blues role as Mahmood stars in West Brom's win over Derby,"The latest edition of South Asians in Football Weekly is out after another decent week for the community in the Beautiful Game... Panjabi Blues co-founder Sukh Singh will head up Birmingham City's landmark new Official Supporters' Clubs (OSC) network. Singh has emerged as a prominent figure in a number of force-for-good initiatives at Blues in recent years, with his Panjabi Blues group raising more than £11,500 for Blue Nose Day in December, in support of Birmingham City's partnership with the Birmingham Children's Trust after organising the very first 'Sleep Out at St Andrews'. An instantly recognisable figure at matches home and away, Singh was part of Birmingham City's Equality, Diversity and Inclusion steering group last season. He also appeared live on Sky Sports News to react to the announcement Tom Brady had become a minority owner in the club. Singh, who will work to represent supporters' interests alongside fellow Platinum away member Paul Delves, told Sky Sports News: ""It is an honour and a privilege to serve a wonderful institution like Birmingham City Football Club. Our club has supporters in every corner of the globe, and together we all want to see us up there with the very best when it comes to fans, football and entertainment. ""The official supporters club give us a unique opportunity to properly unite, bringing Blues fans everywhere closer to the club and making them part of the special journey that this football club is embarking upon."" News of Singh's appointment comes less than a week after British-Pakistani wonderkid Layla Banaras joined Wolves Women on a dual registration for the remainder of the season. South Asians in Football Weekly: Goalkeeper Jas Singh breaks club record as FA Cup hero Sam Khan leaves Luton Town Birminghan City trailblazer Layla Banaras joins Wolves Women on dual registration South Asians in Football Weekly: Otis Khan and Leicester's Arjan Raikhy win on debut as Yan Dhanda and Brandon Khela make history South Asians in Football: Celtic Park start for Yan Dhanda and Brandon Khela sees Ross County make SPFL history South Asians in Football Weekly: Rovers star Millie Chandarana scores a worldie as Derby's Kira Rai dazzles on return AFCON: Tanzania international and South Asian heritage winger Tarryn Allarakhia becomes first Wealdstone footballer to play at tournament Banaras - who launched a nutrition guide and meal planner on Sky Sports News to help Muslim athletes fasting during Ramadan when she was just 14 - became the first South Asian heritage woman to represent Blues in the professional era when she turned out for Blues in last year's Women's FA Cup. Banaras now looks set to make her Wolves debut against WSL opposition this weekend, with Wolves hosting Brighton in a Women's FA Cup fifth-round tie. Speaking after completing the deal to bring Banaras in, Wolves manager Dan McNamara said: ""She's a really talented individual, technically very good and we're really looking forward to seeing her on the pitch. ""She can play in numerous positions. She can play in midfield, out wide, at full-back and is really comfortable on the ball and has a really good eye for a pass. ""She's a young player who we can give opportunities to play senior football and see if we can help her along in her journey."" Head of women and girls football Jenna Burke-Martin added: ""Layla is a really talented player with an exciting future ahead of her in football and we look forward to welcoming her into the pack."" Banaras, meanwhile, has become a youth ambassador for Birmingham Housing Week in an effort to encourage young people to get involved in the conversation around housing in England's Second City and what that could look like for future generations. Banaras said: ""I think it's really important to create opportunities for young people as it gives them a voice and allows them to feel heard."" Mariam Mahmood grabbed an assist before scoring West Brom's winner in a stunning 2-1 victory against Kira Rai's Derby County. Simran Jhamat and Mahmood both featured for West Brom, with Rai starting for the visitors as three girls from South Asian backgrounds took to the pitch in a keenly contested Midlands derby at Redditch United's Valley Stadium. Mahmood, who returned to the line-up after injury to make her first West Brom appearance of 2024, looked on her game from the first whistle, starting on the left flank as manager Siobhan Hodgetts-Still fielded an attacking line-up for the visit of the Ewes. The 19-year-old attacker skinned Derby County's full-back and squared for Niamh Deasy to convert West Brom's opener, before smashing home what proved to be the winner after a delightful, flicked pass from Phoebe Warner. There was also a touching moment during the first half when Derby County midfielder Amy Sims needed treatment for a head injury, with Rai joining the club's medical staff to tend to her stricken team-mate during a 15-minute delay. Pakistan international Zahmena Malik is the latest British player to make a move to Saudi Arabia. Jordan Henderson might have cut short his stint in the country to join Ajax, but Leicester-born Nigeria international Ashleigh Plumptre is still playing in Saudi, with Malik now joining her after completing a move to Riyadh-based Al Hmmah. Former Spurs academy star Malik played at London Seaward last season, with her stunning form earning her an international call-up. Malik grabbed a memorable 89th-minute assist on her international debut in a historic clash against Comoros last year, with Pakistan's women playing African opposition for the first time. The east Londoner, who featured in last year's launch of the first South Asian heritage female player timeline, scored Pakistan's winner in an Olympic qualifier against Tajikistan last April. ""Zahmena has been an amazing find for the Pakistan National Team and having scored the country's winning goal in our first-ever Olympic qualifying win, it's clear that she can certainly play at a high level in Asia,"" Footballistan podcast host Shahrukh Sohail told Sky Sports News. ""Al Hmmah are an ambitious club who are well-positioned to challenge at the higher echelons of the game in Saudi Arabia in coming years."" Former Aston Villa midfielder Arjan Raikhy followed up on his FA Cup appearance for Leicester City, by making his Championship debut in a 3-1 victory for the Foxes against Swansea City. Raikhy started for Leicester's U21s, two days after making an appearance in the 3-0 FA Cup win over Birmingham City, before coming on as a substitute in the win against the Swans less than 24 hours later. Sky Sports News exclusively revealed back in August Raikhy had signed for Leicester as a free agent after leaving Villa where he had been part of the FA Youth Cup-winning team. Raikhy made his senior debut in English football in an FA Cup third-round tie against Liverpool in 2021.

8415,Chelsea vs Man City: Nathalie Bjorn out to deny Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw another hat-trick as top two in WSL meet,"Chelsea defender Nathalie Bjorn has issued a warning to Man City forward Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw that she won't be allowed to repeat her hat-trick heroics against her when the Women's Super League's top two teams meet on Friday night. The last time Bjorn came up against WSL top scorer Shaw was in Everton colours, as the City forward scored three in a 4-1 win in December. Since then, the Swedish defender completed a January transfer window move to the WSL leaders, who take on City at Kingsmeadow. ""Bunny is a really good football player. She's strong, good in the air, good at turning. So it will be a tough game,"" Bjorn told Sky Sports. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It's good that I've played against her a few times, so I know what kind of player she is. ""Last time I played against her she scored a hat-trick, that will not happen on Friday.""

Latest Women's Super League news Women's Super League table Women's Super League fixtures Download the Sky Sports App However, the Blues are on a good run themselves having won their last nine in all competitions. They have also only conceded once while new signing Bjorn has been on the pitch. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Focus will turn to how the Swedish defender can help stop City's firing attack, which also includes Lauren Hemp and Chloe Kelly. Asked how she deals with the individual battle against a striker like Shaw, Bjorn replied: ""Like any other game. They are very good players and are so good at what they do. ""But other than that, before a game like this I just prepare how I would in any game and think about myself and what I can do to help my team."" After Friday's game, Chelsea have a busy March schedule as they try to give Emma Hayes the perfect send-off as they fight for four competitions. Next month, the Blues have a League Cup semi-final with Man City, an FA Cup quarter-final away at Bjorn's former club Everton, a Champions League last-eight tie with Ajax - plus another WSL heavyweight clash with Arsenal, live on Sky Sports on March 15. It's a massive week in the WSL this weekend - as the top four teams all face each other in a week that could have a huge impact on the title race. Chelsea host Man City on Friday night at Kingsmeadow, with just three points separating the two teams. You can follow that game on Sky Sports' digital platforms via the live blog, with kick-off at 7.15pm. Then on Saturday lunchtime, third-placed Arsenal host Man Utd at the Emirates Stadium, live on Sky Sports.

8416,Sarina Wiegman: England Women boss urges FIFA and UEFA to make changes to calendar and protect players,"Sarina Wiegman has urged FIFA and UEFA to make changes to the women's football calendar and provide ""proper rest"" periods for elite players. On Tuesday, Wiegman named her squad for England's friendlies against Austria and Italy later this month, when the Lionesses will be without Millie Bright and Bethany England. Wiegman also had to make do without several players for the World Cup last summer, with Leah Williamson and Beth Mead both missing due to ACL injuries. The number of serious knee injuries suffered by players in the women's game is one of the factors that has led to calls for the fixture schedule to be altered - and Wiegman wants the governing bodies to take action. ""We have a June window. Then after that, there's the Olympics, which is not for us. Then at the beginning of September, there's Champions League again. What the players ask all the time is: 'Where is the rest for us?'"" said the England boss. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""They want to compete, and we want the players fit and fresh. That means you always need rest - a proper rest. You need to train in June and July, too. ""We have had conversations with clubs - those have been very good - but we still don't have a solution for that period. Women's Super League fixtures Stream Sky Sports with NOW Get Sky Sports Download the Sky Sports app ""FIFA and UEFA need to solve that for the players. I don't want to get in the same situation with the players and clubs that we had last year - no one wants that. ""When we talk about the calendar from 2025 on, this really needs to be solved. Yes, it's complex at moments, but players at the highest level, the demands are so high that they need a proper rest in between seasons."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Wiegman added: ""It starts with the FIFA calendar. I know that's complex. Then it's UEFA and the Champions League. ""The Women's Super League starts a little later next season but you can't have rest if you play in the first round of the Champions League. ""The federations need to adapt to that, too. If you adapt a little bit then you can build in rest for players. That's what we really need to do. ""We need to stay connected, we need to communicate and we need to have the right people around the table to make the decision, and to know what the consequences are."" England reached the World Cup final last summer, meaning they played seven matches in Australia and New Zealand. The Lionesses then played six Nations League matches between September and December. After two friendlies this month, England will play six Euro 2025 qualifiers between April and July. As a result, Wiegman's side will have played 21 matches in the 12 months since the start of the World Cup. England's schedule would have been even more congested had they qualified for the Olympics, which take place in July and August. What is more, England's players must also contend with a packed calendar at club level. For example, Chelsea - England's sole representative in the Champions League - could play up to 11 games in Europe. The Blues will also play 22 WSL fixtures and could play as many as five in the FA Cup and three in the League Cup - meaning a total of 41 in all competitions. As a result, a Chelsea and England player who played at the World Cup and was available for every one of their team's fixtures during the 2023/24 season could play up to 62 matches for club and country during the calendar year. Sky Sports' Laura Hunter: The fact that Sarina Wiegman is able to call on Leah Williamson again is a huge boost, particularly in light of Millie Bright's extended absence. Curiously, Wiegman stayed coy on Williamson's position as captain, presumably because she's been out of the fold for close to a year. A lot has happened since then. Williamson is yet to play a full 90 since her injury return and competitive minutes will need managing. Perhaps Wiegman will take this opportunity to test the waters - England haven't had the luxury of many international windows playing only friendly fixtures. The Dutchwoman was also quick to point out that others have stepped up admirably in the Arsenal defender's wake. I've particularly liked what I've seen in a leadership capacity from Georgia Stanway - she has captain energy. Mary Earps has also come to the fore. She led the side during a difficult December and is a commanding figure, reliable too. She'd be a popular appointment. Goalkeepers: Mary Earps (Man Utd), Khiara Keating (Man City), Hannah Hampton (Chelsea). Defenders: Lucy Bronze (Barcelona), Jess Carter (Chelsea), Niamh Charles (Chelsea), Esme Morgan (Man City), Alex Greenwood (Man City), Lotte Wubben-Moy (Arsenal), Leah Williamson (Arsenal), Maya Le Tissier (Man Utd). Midfielders: Grace Clinton (Tottenham), Fran Kirby (Chelsea), Jess Park (Man City), Keira Walsh (Barcelona), Georgia Stanway (Bayern Munich), Ella Toone (Man Utd). Forwards: Alessia Russo (Arsenal), Rachel Daly (Aston Villa), Lauren Hemp (Man City), Chloe Kelly (Man City), Lauren James (Chelsea), Beth Mead (Arsenal).

8424,Scottish Women's Premier League round-up: Rangers remain six clear of Celtic in title race,"A round-up from the Scottish Women's Premier League as leaders Rangers beat Hearts to remain six points clear of Celtic, who won at Motherwell. Rangers 1 - 0 Hearts Rangers overcame Hearts as the Gers battled for three points in Cumbernauld. Few chances separated the sides in the opening minutes but that changed thanks to Jane Ross. Rachel Rowe picked out Ross in the Hearts area, and the forward found the back of the net for the only goal of the game. The home side would've hoped for more goals but will be happy with the win that keeps them securely at the top of the table and six points clear of Celtic. Rangers will hope to remain unbeaten on Sunday when they visit Petershill Park to take on Partick Thistle while Hearts host Aberdeen on the same day. Motherwell 0 - 2 Celtic Get Sky Sports Download the Sky Sports App Live football on Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments It was a job well done for Elena Sadiku's side as Celtic picked up a vital three points in the title race with a 2-0 victory over Motherwell at K Park. Caitlin Hayes broke the deadlock with 27 minutes played as the defender nodded a Celtic corner past the goalkeeper. With eight minutes left to play, Amy Gallacher doubled the Celts' advantage as she struck a Paula Partido cross into the back of the net. Celtic visit the capital next as they take on Hibernian on Sunday. Motherwell are in Lanarkshire derby action with a trip to face Hamilton Accies. Aberdeen 2 - 1 Montrose Aberdeen came from behind to beat Montrose 2-1 in a thrilling encounter in the ScottishPower Women's Premier League. The visitors opened the scoring as Holly Daniel put her side up a few minutes into the second half. Montrose fashioned another chance on the hour mark as Neve Guthrie found herself through on goal. She could only fire wide - a miss that the visitors would soon regret. With 73 minutes gone, Eilidh Shore found the equaliser for Aberdeen as she rose above the rest to head in off the woodwork. The game entered the closing stages and with three minutes left on the clock, Francesca Ogilvie worked her way inside the box and fired into the far side of goal, beating the goalkeeper. The late strike proved to be the winner as the home side claimed all three points and moved six points clear in 7th. Aberdeen will be hoping for back-to-back victories on Sunday when they travel away to take on Hearts. Montrose will hope to cause a shock as they host reigning league champions Glasgow City. Spartans 0 - 1 Partick Thistle Partick Thistle made it three league wins in a row with a narrow 1-0 victory over Spartans. No goals separated the sides in the first half but Carla Boyce fired Thistle in front with 57 minutes on the clock. The striker headed in from Amy Bulloch's free-kick to make it two goals in two games since joining Thistle in January. The result pushes the Jags up to 5th in the table, three points clear of Hearts, while Spartans remain in the relegation play-off spot. A difficult tie up next for Thistle as they host Rangers on Sunday while Spartans are away from home to face relegation rivals Dundee United. Glasgow City 6 - 0 Hamilton Accies One goal in the first half and five in the second gave Glasgow City a comfortable win over Hamilton Accies as the visitors remain rooted to the bottom of the SWPL table. With just over half an hour gone, Emily Whelan got on the end of a cross from Lauren Davidson and struck home the opener. They took the lead going into half-time, but they would show off their attacking prowess in the second half. Scorer of the opener, Whelan, crossed into the box and found Aleigh Gambone. The American found the back of the net for City's second. Brilliant play from Lisa Forrest set up Whelan for another goal and she made no mistake in slotting it past the goalkeeper. Lauren Davidson added her name to the scoresheet 10 minutes later as her pinpoint strike left the goalkeeper with no chance. After being on the pitch for mere seconds, Wilma Forsblom added to City's lead as the new signing hit the ground running in Glasgow. Rounding off a fantastic performance for the reigning SWPL champions, Cori Sullivan found the net from a free-kick shortly before the final whistle. Glasgow City have a trip to Montrose on Sunday as they take on the 11th-placed side in what they will hope to make a dominant away day. Hamilton Accies will hope for a positive result in the Lanarkshire derby against Motherwell, who they face on the same day. Correctly predict six scorelines to win £250,000 for free with Super 6.

8429,"WSL: Emma Hayes, Lauren James and Vivianne Miedema win January awards","Emma Hayes, Lauren James and Vivianne Miedema have won the WSL monthly awards for January. Chelsea boss Hayes - who will leave the club at the end of the season after 12 years - has won January's WSL Manager of the Month award having overseen three league wins since the winter break. Two of those came in January, with the Blues having scored three goals in each fixture and conceded just once against Manchester United. This has all come without Chelsea's star striker Sam Kerr, who snapped her ACL during the Blues' Morocco training camp. It would not have had a bearing on the WSL award, but Hayes also secured Chelsea top spot in their Champions League group as they aim to win the European trophy for the first time.

8438,South Asians in Football Weekly: Goalkeeper Jas Singh breaks club record as FA Cup hero Sam Khan leaves Luton Town,"The latest edition of South Asians in Football Weekly is out after another eventful week for the community in the Beautiful Game... Jas Singh kept his eighth clean sheet in a row at the weekend to enter the record books at National League North leaders Tamworth FC for the most minutes played by a goalkeeper without conceding a goal in 91 years of club history. Safe hands Singh kept a clean sheet in a 1-0 win against Farsley Celtic, and has now gone 808 minutes since conceding a goal - breaking a club record previously set during the 1988/89 season by Dale Belford, a year before Singh was born. The victory against Farsley Celtic has sent Tamworth 12 points clear of Scunthorpe at the top of the table in what is looking increasingly like an unstoppable march to promotion to the National League. Goalkeeper Singh counts Shrewsbury Town, Telford United, Kidderminster Harriers, Gloucester City and Solihull Moors among his previous clubs. He won non-League Player of the Year at the 2013 Asian Football Awards and was named Tamworth's Players' Player of the Year in 2022. Singh appears to have now put himself firmly in contention for a place in next month's England C non-League squad. Sky Sports News revealed at the beginning of the year that England are heading back to Wales to play Cymru C next month, with that match now pencilled in for March 19 at Llanelli Town's Stebonheath Park.

""And he's not just a player who has turned up out of nowhere, he's played a few hundred games at a really good level. ""Jas is one of a number of exceptionally talented British South Asians playing at the higher end of non-League football. ""But he's a brilliant role model in his own right, and he's shown that with the work that he has put in to get to this milestone and write his name into the history books at Tamworth. ""It's a great achievement and Singh and Tamworth have been a great partnership."" Women's FA Cup hero Sam Khan has announced her departure from Luton Town Ladies. Former Actonians striker Khan made an emotional return to her hometown club ahead of this season, and scored one of the most famous goals in Luton Town Ladies' modern history with her FA Cup third-round strike against Keynsham Town in December. Khan's winner set up a tie with WSL Brighton in a cup run that earned Luton almost £50,000 in prize money. Her Game Too Luton Town ambassador Hina Shafi told Sky Sports News: ""Sam Khan's contribution to Luton Town Ladies is there for all to see. ""Her FA Cup goal will live long in the memory and she's inspired countless people on and off the pitch during her time at the club.

8445,London City Lionesses 0-4 Arsenal Women: Cloe Lacasse double helps Gunners into Conti Cup semis,"Holders Arsenal cruised into the last four of the Continental Tyres Cup on Wednesday evening after a 4-0 win over London City Lionesses. Cloe Lacasse scored twice, with a Kim Little penalty sandwiched in between, before Alessia Russo rounded off the scoring in the second half. The Gunners made light work of their Championship opposition in a game that was originally postponed due to a waterlogged pitch - and had seen London City head coach Carolina Morace sacked before the rescheduled fixture was confirmed. Lacasse redirected Stina Blackstenius' header on target to open the scoring in the 39th minute, before the Sweden forward was clumsily hauled down inside the box by goalkeeper Grace Moloney. The mistake gifted Little the chance from the penalty spot, an opportunity she rarely passes up, while a cooly-taken third was dispatched by Lacasse 12 minutes into the second period. Russo, on as a substitute, scored with almost her first touch when guiding a header beneath Moloney moments after replacing Blackstenius, completing the four-goal success.

8481,Sonia Bompastor: Chelsea Women approach Lyon head coach to replace outgoing Emma Hayes,"Chelsea have approached Lyon head coach Sonia Bompastor to become their new manager. Current Blues boss Emma Hayes announced she would be leaving the club at the end of the season to take up a position with the USA national team in November. Negotiations are ongoing but the French coach is the first candidate Chelsea have reached out to. Bompastor, a Champions League winner as a player and manager, is contracted to the French champions until 2025. She was capped 156 times by the France national team before retiring in 2013 to take up a coaching position within Lyon's Academy. Following the sacking of Jean-Luc Vasseur in April 2021, the 43-year-old was appointed as Lyonnais Feminin head coach. Chelsea players Catarina Macario and Kadeisha Buchanan were both coached by Bompastor at Lyon before their respective moves to west London. Stream the WSL and more with NOW Women's Super League table Get Sky Sports Download the Sky Sports App Sky Sports reporter Anton Toloui: Chelsea's move for Bompastor will come as a surprise for many reasons despite her playing and coaching career. To approach one of the few teams seen as genuine contenders for the Champions League is a bold one, especially as they could play each other in this year's final. Bompastor is seen as an exceptionally pragmatic coach, which may be one of the reasons Chelsea are interested, but it will be interesting to see what her vision for a post-Hayes future will be. Her strategic mind did win Lyon the Champions League in 2022, when her Lyon side outfought and out-thought all-conquering Barcelona. Bompastor is a winner both as a player and a coach and her team is experienced in filling trophy cabinets. She has also worked with big-money free agent signings Kadeisha Buchanan and Catarina Macario before, which will help her cause. But the approach for Bompastor shows how few top-level female candidates there are in the game. The fact there are so few women Chelsea see as qualified for the job is a sign of how much progress needs to be made. Sky Sports' Laura Hunter: The rationale behind Chelsea making a beeline for Sonia Bompastor is twofold. The first, and should not be underestimated given Chelsea's recent history, is the fact she's a born winner. That's attractive to a team who have retained a monopoly over domestic silverware for the past five seasons. In her first full season in charge at Lyon, Bompastor led her side to a league and European double - beating Barcelona 3-1 in the Champions League final, scoring three times inside the opening 33 minutes. She holds an 85 per cent win percentage as manager. Her record as a player is similar, littered with triumphs and titles, as well as over 150 international caps. The list of achievements is vastly impressive. The second reason is less obvious but important to state. In Emma Hayes, Chelsea had a trailblazer. One of the game's chief champions who has been responsible for growth and change - a major player in improving the overall health of the sport. The fact she has done so from a female perspective is equally important. Hayes entered the game at a time when very few female voices were taken seriously - a gap in experienced female head coaches still exists to this day. Bompastor will be seen as one of the few coaches, currently managing at a top European club, who can directly relate. These are big boots to fill, and very few candidates with the credentials Chelsea would prioritise to fill them. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  French football expert Julien Laurens speaking live from Paris on Sky Sports News: ""It would be a great choice. She's wonderful, she's had a great impact since she's taken over at Lyon. They play really good football and she's only a young coach. ""For me, she's got all the ingredients to become a top, top head coach. She is already. She speaks English too, so that wouldn't be a barrier. ""It's hard to follow in the steps of Emma Hayes, of course, it would be hard for anybody. But I think Bompastor would be keen for that challenge. She ticks all the boxes to become the next Chelsea manager.""

8482,Man Utd and Sir Jim Ratcliffe get Premier League and FA approval over deal to buy 25 per cent of the club,"The Football Association has approved Sir Jim Ratcliffe's purchase of a 25 per
cent stake in Manchester United. Confirmation that the Premier League had given its backing to the deal was contained within an update to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday evening. A further SEC update published on Wednesday afternoon confirmed that approval from the FA has been granted as completion edges closer, while the Barclays Women's Super League and Barclays Women's Championship board have also approved the acquisition. Within an amended tender offer statement published on Wednesday afternoon came confirmation that the national governing body's approval ""has already been obtained"". The green light from the FA is one of the last remaining steps but the deal cannot be completed until the tender offer for Class A shares is finalised. The period in which holders of Class A shares can tender them for sale has been extended from February 14 until 23:59 on February 16. Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol: Man Utd fixtures Live Premier League table Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports ""This news is significant because it was one of the hurdles that he needed to clear before his deal to buy a quarter of Manchester United was rubber-stamped. ""It was a formality but it is important it has been announced. On Tuesday, it was approved by the Premier League as well. ""He has already agreed a deal with the Glazer family to buy 25 per cent of their shares. ""So, the final thing he needs to do is agree deals to buy 25 per cent of the United shares that are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and that should be done by the end of this week. ""It will then be basically a done deal and should be announced early next week."" In a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, United said it had already been granted approval under Premier League rules over who is allowed to be an owner or director of a football club. The Premier League later provided confirmation in a statement of its approval of his minority stake as well as the $300m (£238m) investment in the club, and said it now awaited the transaction's overall completion. It added: ""The board agreed to the change of the club's ownership structure last week, and this has now been officially ratified by an Independent Oversight Panel. ""This is the first acquisition of control to be reviewed and approved by such a panel following changes to the process which were agreed by Premier League clubs in March 2023."" British billionaire Ratcliffe, who is the owner of multinational chemicals company INEOS, is now closing in on completion of his deal to buy 25 per cent of the club. Ratcliffe agreed a deal to buy a stake in United in December and his tender offer for 25 per cent of the Class A shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange has been extended until midnight on Friday night. The offer, which is part of Ratcliffe's deal to become the minority owner of Manchester United, was originally due to expire at midnight on Tuesday. It was announced on Christmas Eve that the INEOS chairman had agreed to buy a 25 per cent stake in the Premier League club in a deal that included the $300million investment in the club's infrastructure. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  As well as buying Class B shares held by the Glazer family, the announcement confirmed that Ratcliffe would offer to acquire up to 25 per cent of all Class A shares at a price of $33 (£26) per share. Ratcliffe will provide $200m upon completion of the deal and a further $100m by the end of 2024. That additional investment will eventually take Ratcliffe's stake up to 29 per cent. Owners, the Glazer family, will have a 49% stake under the deal As part of the deal, Ratcliffe's INEOS Sport division will take over control of United's football operations after more than a decade since the club won the Premier League title. Ratcliffe has already conducted a series of meetings with club staff and associates in recent days. He has met leaders of the independent Manchester United Supporters' Trust and spoken with local leaders, including senior representatives of Trafford Council, and Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham. He was also among those in attendance at the Munich Air Disaster memorial last week. Ratcliffe is reportedly already planning to lead an overhaul of United's playing squad. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The 71-year-old was a boyhood United fan and last month described his proposed investment as the most exciting deal he has done in his career. ""I have done a few exciting things, but there is no question (about that),"" he said. Under the filing, more details were provided about Ratcliffe's personal wealth which said his ""liquid assets (primarily consisting of cash and readily marketable securities) were in excess of $4bn. It said his net worth was ""significantly in excess of those liquid assets"". Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Manchester United are planning to make a formal approach to Newcastle for sporting director Dan Ashworth. It is understood the Newcastle chief is top of Ratcliffe's list to front up his new football operation at Old Trafford, although no formal approach has yet been made. Newcastle would be reluctant to let Ashworth leave but the 52-year-old is privately open to exploring the potential opportunity to join Man Utd. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Newcastle are bracing themselves for a formal approach, but agreeing compensation to secure Ashworth's services would be problematic after he only joined Newcastle two years ago.

The first chance for the hosts came when Linzi Taylor's cross fell to the feet of Demi Falconer. The captain shot from the edge of the box, but it narrowly flew over the crossbar. It was celebration for Thistle fans as they thought they had opened the scoring through Rosie Slater, but the referee blew for a foul in the build-up to keep the score level. Although the visitors tried to up the intensity in the second half, Thistle held their own and kept the Gers at bay. A game of few clear-cut chances ultimately ended in a point a piece, a result that the hosts will be extremely happy with as a statement of their further improvement this season.

Re-opening her Celtic account, Tash Flint found her first SWPL goal of the season as she made no mistake finishing from close range. Leading SWPL goalscorer Jorian Baucom equalised for Hibernian with 23 minutes on the clock. Baucom took advantage of Celtic playing out from the back and fired past Kelsey Daugherty to draw her side level. It didn't take too long for the visitors to take the lead again though, as a pinpoint Shen Mengyu cross found Caitlin Hayes at the back post, who was waiting to head home. Flint got herself a brace just before half-time. She got on the end of Hayes' header and fired beyond the goalkeeper to extend Celtic's lead. They went into the break with a 3-1 lead, and it ended that way as the Celts recorded an important win in the capital. Hearts 4-0 Aberdeen Four goals for Hearts helped them to close the gap on the sides above as they now sit just two points off fourth place. The Jambos found the breakthrough just before the half-hour mark as a corner found the head of Lizzie Waldie, who put it beyond the goalkeeper and into the bottom corner. Shortly after the goal, former Aberdeen player Jenna Penman doubled her side's lead as she sent a low drive into the back of the net. Georgia Timms threatened to make it three, but her attempts were kept out by the goalkeeper, allowing the Dons to go into the second half with only a two-goal deficit. Their chances of a comeback would be nullified when Danni Findlay made it three, and she would secure her brace with a curling effort right before the final whistle. Dundee United 0-6 Spartans A clinical performance from Spartans saw them come out on top in what could prove to be an important result in their bid to avoid relegation. The visitors took an early lead with only three minutes on the clock as a cross into the box found Hannah Jordan, who headed home the opener. Jordan found another in the second half as she was in the right position to smash home a rebound. The third came through Ronaigh Douglas, who struck from 25 yards out and into the top corner of the net. Becky Galbraith got a well-deserved goal next as she latched onto a pinpoint cross and headed beyond the goalkeeper. Robyn McCafferty got involved in the action as she looped a header over the United shot-stopper from a corner. Mya Bates rounded off a fantastic performance at Foundation Park as from the left wing, she sent a shot flying into the Dundee United net. It's a huge result for the Edinburgh side as Spartans move out of the relegation zone and into ninth in the table. Hamilton Accies 2-1 Motherwell It was derby day delight for Hamilton Accies as they pulled off a victory against Motherwell in the Lanarkshire derby. Goals from Josi Giard and Chloe Muir gave them a comfortable lead, and despite Laura Berry pulling one back for the visitors they fell to defeat. Giard opened the scoring in the derby as the forward chipped the ball over Emily Mutch. The hosts doubled their lead early in the second half as Muir fired from range and into the back of the net. The visitors pulled one back just a few minutes later, and they almost drew level, but Emma Thomson made a fantastic save to deny the equaliser. Montrose 1-5 Glasgow City Despite Montrose taking an early lead, it was five-star performance for Glasgow City, who ultimately cruised to victory. The hosts opened the scoring against the reigning league champions as Tammy Harkin headed in from close range. Just 15 minutes later, City found the equaliser as Mairead Fulton's cross was headed home by Kenzie Weir, and the visitors took the lead as Fiona Brown sent a cross into the box, that was headed into the net by Carlee Giammona for her first Glasgow City goal. Now on the front foot, the visitors were desperate for a third and they eventually found it. Brown cut inside and curled the ball into the top corner, giving her side a comfortable lead after the early scare. They weren't done either as Brown got a second, tapping home from Kinga Kozak's cross. Rounding off a good performance, Fulton struck from the edge of the box and found the top corner right before the final whistle.

8491,England Women: Leah Williamson earns first Lionesses recall since ACL injury return,"Leah Williamson has been named in an England Women's squad for the first time since returning from a serious knee injury. England captain Williamson, who was forced to sit out last summer's Women's World Cup after suffering an ACL rupture, returned to action for the Gunners in late January after a nine-month lay-off, and is now back in Lionesses contention for the upcoming friendlies against Austria and Italy in February. It is the first time the Arsenal defender will feature in an England selection since the team lifted the Women's Finalissima trophy in April 2023. Jess Park, who last featured for the Lionesses in October, has also been included in the 23-player group. Millie Bright and Bethany England are out injured while there is no room for Nikita Parris despite a good run of form for Manchester United. This will be the final camp before England's qualification campaign for Euro 2025 begins in April - the draw for that competition takes place on March 5. Head coach Sarina Wiegman said: ""This camp is where the road to Euro 2025 in Switzerland begins. Playing against strong teams like Austria and Italy is just the preparation we need before we kick off our qualifying campaign in April. Free-to-watch WSL highlights Download the Sky Sports App Get Sky Sports Stream the WSL and more with NOW ""I am really looking forward to getting back on the grass with the squad."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  On Williamson's return, Wiegman said: ""It's really nice, especially for her. She's back. She's gaining minutes at Arsenal and doing well. It'll be really good to see her in camp. ""She's a very good player with great decision-making. She's been out for a number of months, so is still building. I've seen other players step up [in Williamson's absence]. Asked about Williamson's continuation as captain, the Dutchwoman added: ""It's a new moment. We'll start again, and have a conversation with the group."" Speaking about Nikita Parris' exclusion: ""The competition up front is really high. I've made some other decisions for this camp, but I hope she can keep some consistency because we're thinking about her again. ""I had a brief conversation with her yesterday, she understands. We're in a luxury position with our options in forward positions. She knows we're watching her very closely."" On the disappointment of missing out on Paris Olympics qualification: ""December was devastating. We played two incredible games - I saw rhythm in the team and performances were really good. We can't control what opponents do. We wanted to be on the other side and qualify, and we were disappointed. But we have the opportunity to play friendlies now to improve and develop. That's good too."" Sky Sports' Laura Hunter: The fact that Sarina Wiegman is able to call on Leah Williamson again is a huge boost, particularly in light of Millie Bright's extended absence. Curiously, Wiegman stayed coy on Williamson's position as captain, presumably because she's been out of the fold for close to a year. A lot has happened since then. Williamson is yet to play a full 90 since her injury return and competitive minutes will need managing. Perhaps Wiegman will take this opportunity to test the waters - England haven't had the luxury of many international windows playing only friendly fixtures. The Dutchwoman was also quick to point out that others have stepped up admirably in the Arsenal defender's wake. I've particularly liked what I've seen in a leadership capacity from Georgia Stanway - she has captain energy. Mary Earps has also come to the fore. She led the side during a difficult December and is a commanding figure, reliable too. She'd be a popular appointment. Goalkeepers: Mary Earps (Man Utd), Khiara Keating (Man City), Hannah Hampton (Chelsea). Defenders: Lucy Bronze (Barcelona), Jess Carter (Chelsea), Niamh Charles (Chelsea), Esme Morgan (Man City), Alex Greenwood (Man City), Lotte Wubben-Moy (Arsenal), Leah Williamson (Arsenal), Maya Le Tissier (Man Utd). Midfielders: Grace Clinton (Tottenham), Fran Kirby (Chelsea), Jess Park (Man City), Keira Walsh (Barcelona), Georgia Stanway (Bayern Munich), Ella Toone (Man Utd).

8501,Dundee: Camperdown Stadium plans submitted as club bid to relocate from Dens Park,"Dundee have submitted planning permission for a new 'state-of-the-art stadium' that could see the club leave Dens Park after 125 years. The new stadium will have a capacity for over 12,500 fans, include a safe-standing area in the home end and has been designed to also hold music concerts and other major entertainment events. Currently Dundee play at Dens Park - which has been the club's home since 1899 - but that could soon end if the project to build a new stadium and campus at Camperdown Park goes ahead. Both the Scottish FA and Scottish Professional Football League have welcomed the move following the submission of planning permission to the city council. Ian Maxwell, Scottish FA chief executive, said: ""Dens Park has been an iconic Scottish football stadium for more than 100 years and while fans of all generations will cherish their favourite memories inside the stadium, we understand the club's wish to future-proof their home and improve the matchday experience for supporters for the next 100 years. ""The Scottish FA is supportive of plans that will improve club infrastructure, the supporter experience and the image of the national game."" Neil Doncaster, SPFL chief executive, added: ""Any club that seeks to invest in improving infrastructure to this scale deserves enormous credit.

8508,"Women's FA Cup: Man City win at Arsenal, Chelsea edge Crystal Palace, Man Utd brush past Southampton","Laia Aleixandri earned Manchester City a spot in the Women's FA Cup quarter-finals with a second-half winner against Arsenal. The Gunners came into the fifth-round contest hoping to bounce back from a first Women's Super League loss to West Ham, but could not find the finishing touch at Meadow Park as they crashed out 1-0. A scrappy first half gave way to a more open second period with chances for both sides, WSL leading goalscorer Khadija Shaw seeing two headed efforts kept out, first by Arsenal keeper Sabrina D'Angelo then by defender Leah Williamson in her second start since returning from a long-term anterior cruciate ligament injury. Shaw, in a worrying sight for City boss Gareth Taylor, was forced off and replaced by Mary Fowler in the 67th minute, shortly before Gunners substitute Steph Catley failed to clear Chloe Kelly's free-kick and Spain international Aleixandri pounced, poking in the 74th-minute winner. Khiara Keating's stunning series of saves against a late Arsenal surge preserved the visiting side's lead, and while the Gunners felt the City keeper had not saved a last-ditch effort from a scramble before it crossed the line, the officials disagreed. Holders Chelsea took one step closer to securing a fourth straight FA Cup crown with a 1-0 victory over Championship side Crystal Palace at Kingsmeadow thanks a superb maiden goal from January signing Mayra Ramirez. Emma Hayes had initially changed all 11 players from the side that beat Sunderland 5-0 in their midweek Conti Cup clash, but Fran Kirby returned as a replacement for Lauren James, who was a late withdrawal from the line-up. It was a valiant performance from Palace, who held the hosts to a goalless draw for 81 minutes, when Ramirez opened her Blues account with a brilliant backheeled flick to book her side another trip into the last eight. There were wild scenes at Wolverhampton when Beth Merrick's 67th-minute penalty for Wolves - one of two third-tier sides remaining - cancelled out Katie Robinson's first-half opener for relegation-threatened WSL side Brighton. The teams remained on level terms until Emma Kullberg's first goal for Brighton fired the Seagulls into an 88th-minute lead, before the Sweden international then completed her hat-trick inside a stunning eight minutes. Manchester United, last season's runners-up, claimed a 3-1 victory over Championship outfit Southampton, with Rachel Williams heading home twice after Lexi Lloyd-Smith had cancelled out Ella Toone's eighth-minute opener. Kit Graham's low, long-range effort in the 76th minute of Tottenham's 1-0 victory over Charlton spelled the end of the Championship leaders' cup run, while goals from Sophie Roman Haug and Melissa Lawley secured Liverpool a 2-0 win over London City Lionesses. Leicester shrugged off the shock of conceding an early goal to beat Birmingham 6-2 and cruise into the Women's FA Cup quarter-finals. A Missy Goodwin own goal put the Championship side in front after just two minutes, but goals from Janice Cayman and Shannon O'Brien quickly turned the tie on its head. Libby Smith levelled for the visitors just before the break, but further goals from O'Brien, Saori Takarada, Deanne Rose and Aileen Whelan saw Leicester home.

8512,Arsenal Women: Jonas Eidevall's side need better conversion rate or risk falling out of WSL title contention,"Jonas Eidevall has called it a 'sin'. The stats back him up. He is referring to Arsenal's tendency, intentional or not, to indulge style over substance. Their failure to convert dominance into goals. It's been a problem plaguing the Gunners for seasons, pre-dating Eidevall's tenure, but one that threatens to cling onto this term's title challenge like a bad smell. ""We're back a little bit to some of the sins earlier in the season, where on the chances we get, we don't get shots on target,"" Eidevall said ponderously after Arsenal's third WSL loss of the season two weekends ago. It appears to be a reccurring theme. The weight of expectation on Arsenal, and Eidevall, to deliver trophies this season feels heavier and more burdensome than ever before. The reasons for that are multifaceted, and many have been calculated elsewhere on these pages, but adequate context requires a few finer details to be declared here. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Arsenal have found a way to be consistently creative, playing attractive and expansive football, without the corresponding end product. They have found a formula for attracting big crowds to games - loyal and faithful supporters - but not always compatible results. Stream the WSL and more with NOW Download the Sky Sports App Free-to-watch WSL highlights Live WSL table They've made big marquee signings and are yet to see the best of them. Most glaringly, they've won one solitary trophy in the past five years. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  To confuse matters, and for suitable balance, there is a huge amount to like about this Arsenal side, if only they could put the ball in the back of the net more consistently. It's here where the stats are most exposing. Across the past three WSL campaigns (up to and including the most recent matchday), Arsenal have ranked second, behind Chelsea, for big chances created (50.3 per season), but first for big chances missed (28.3 per season). Again, only Chelsea (243) can boast a better record than Arsenal (233) for shots attempted this term, yet Arsenal rank fifth in the charts for shots on target (6.1 per game). Their shot conversion rate (11.3 per cent) puts them seventh. It runs deeper. Arsenal lead the way in corners won and possession wins in the final third, and are second (again behind Chelsea) for touches in the opposition box (533), but rank fourth for average goals scored per game (2.2). The numbers don't tally. They have the second-best 'big chance' creator in the league in Victoria Pelova but no closer. No player with a 'scruff of the neck' attitude who can turn a game in an instant - at least not with enough regularity. The Gunners' top scorer this term is Alessia Russo, who has hit the net five times; her goal conversion rate is 18 per cent, while Man City's Bunny Shaw, who has scored 13 times, boasts a conversion rate of 33 per cent. Chelsea's Lauren James has 12 goals and has also converted 33 per cent of her chances. That's no slight on Russo herself, but illustrative of Arsenal's struggles more broadly. Arsenal's shot conversion rate of 11.3 per cent ranks seventh-best in the WSL, and is far lower than top four rivals. There's a softness that underpins Eidevall's side. A lack of ruthlessness and clinical edge that will prevent them from realising the ultimate dream of beating Chelsea to WSL gold. The same can be said of the way they were dumped unceremoniously out of the FA Cup by Manchester City last Sunday, losing 1-0. Adding insult to injury. Williamson returns to Lionesses squad And yet, sandwiched between all the stats that suggest the Gunners' performance in final third is inhibiting progress, is an individual result that disrupted the pattern. An offer of hope and promise. A performance that prompted this journalist to write about them as the team to beat this term - the ones driving the title agenda. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Arsenal produced their most complete performance under Eidevall back in December, beating Chelsea 4-1, outperforming their xG (2.97) for only the fourth time this season. The atmosphere created by a record WSL crowd inside Emirates Stadium matched the spark on the pitch and goals flowed as a result. The football was breathtaking. Arsenal drew level on points at the top of the league with their London rivals that day and dented more than just egos. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""That's as bad as I've seen us for a long time,"" Hayes said post-match. ""They bullied us."" Chelsea, so often the aggressors, getting tormented by Arsenal's attacking efficiency felt like a moment. A turning point. A curious shift in energy. Maybe this is the Gunners' time, many promptly - and prematurely - surmised. Alas, a regular scourge has reared its ugly head in recent weeks. Failing to capitalise on that obvious power switch may be Eidevall's biggest regret yet. Something's amiss. Arsenal have lost two of their last four WSL games and will be looking to avoid suffering consecutive
defeats for the first time this season against Man Utd on Saturday. Arsenal have underperformed against their xG in three of four league games since beating Chelsea. Against Tottenham the following week their expected goals tally reached 2.52 and they lost 1-0. Their most recent WSL outing, a 2-1 defeat at West Ham, was equally underwhelming. The Hammers had never beaten Arsenal before. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""We created enough chances to turn the game around, but we didn't put the ball away,"" said Eidevall, not for the first time, likely not for the last. Even Arsenal's set-piece xG is the best in the league (6.58). It's like getting all the way through a joke and stumbling over the punchline. A front four of Caitlin Foord, Viv Miedema, Beth Mead and Russo are capable of so much more and Eidevall, a deep, analytical thinker, will be busy examining how he can tap into their unrealised threat. How best to put those players in positions where scoring is inexorable. Arsenal are winless in four straight WSL games against Manchester United (D2 L2), since a 2-0 away win in November 2021. For all their beautiful approach play, intricate passing triangles, and movement into opposition boxes, finishing continues to let this enterprising Arsenal side down. This recent streak is just the latest example. WSL winners, as Chelsea have proven time again, learn from their shortcomings. If Arsenal are going to deal with theirs, in time to re-enter the title picture, it's going to have to be now.

8514,IFAB delays plans to publish details of blue card and sin-bin trials until March,"Football's lawmakers have delayed plans to publish details of sin-bin trials - which were expected to include the introduction of blue cards - at higher levels of football until next month. Trial protocols on sin-bins, plus other measures to combat poor player behaviour, were expected to be published on Friday, but it is understood they will now be the subject of further discussion at the International Football Association Board (IFAB]'s annual general meeting at Loch Lomond on March 2. IFAB has chosen to delay the publication of the proposals to allow more time for discussion. Sin-bins have been used in grassroots football successfully for a number of years but IFAB indicated at its annual business meeting in November a willingness to test them at higher levels. It is understood that in these planned trials players would be shown blue cards for dissent and tactical fouls, such as Giorgio Chiellini's cynical tug on Bukayo Saka for Italy against England in the Euro 2020 final. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The introduction of a blue card, if it passed into the laws of the game, would mark the biggest single change in managing player discipline since red and yellow cards came into force at the 1970 World Cup. It is understood the plan was not to test sin-bins in top-level competitions initially but to stress test them in lower-level events. Future of Football: Rule changes you wanted to see... and ones you didn't Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! This is understood to be because of concerns about the impact on players coping with different rules being used in a domestic league and a continental competition, for instance. It is unclear precisely what level IFAB had in mind for these trials but certainly a higher level than the grassroots game. The agenda for next month's AGM - published earlier this week - confirmed discussions would be held on the trials approved at November's ABM for sin-bins, captain-only zones around referees and the testing of cooling-off periods as a means for managing mass confrontations. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  There is also due to be a discussion around a new trial on how best to tackle the problem of goalkeepers holding on to the ball for too long. FIFA posted on X on Thursday night to say that reports around the use of blue cards in elite football were ""incorrect and premature"". The global governing body added: ""Any such trials, if implemented, should be limited to testing in a responsible manner at lower levels, a position that FIFA intends to reiterate when this agenda item is discussed at the IFAB AGM on March 2."" Sin-bins were introduced across all levels of grassroots football from the 2019/20 season in an attempt to improve levels of respect and fair play in the game. The rule change was implemented up to step five of the National League system and tier three and below in women's football. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Managers had their say on the potential introduction of blue cards on Friday - and were less than enthusiastic. Jurgen Klopp argued: ""The introduction of a new card would just give more opportunities to fail because the discussion then would be, 'should it have been a blue card, or a yellow card?' ""It does not sound like a fantastic idea but I can't remember when the last fantastic idea came from these guys, [or] if they ever had one."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mauricio Pochettino echoed Klopp's thoughts, saying: ""I think it is going to create more divides, be more complicated to the referees, the players and the fans. My feeling now is that it's not a good idea but we'll see what happens. ""Give it an opportunity to see how it works and after to have a better idea about how they want to apply it during the game. Ange Postecoglou: ""One team being down to 10 men for 10 minutes, you know what it's going to do to our game? It's going to destroy it, mate. ""You're going to have one team just sitting there trying to waste time for 10 minutes waiting for a guy to come on. ""Every other sport is trying to declutter. All we're trying to do is go the other way for some bizarre reason."" Mikel Arteta said the tests need to be rigorous before blue cards are introduced into the elite game, saying: ""I don't know if we're going to get there. We've got a lot going on now with decisions, with technology - I don't know if we're ready for that yet! ""Hopefully it's going to be tested very, very well before it's introduced at this level."" Jonas Eidevall suggested the lack of application of the rule preventing goalkeepers from holding the ball for more than six seconds was a bigger issue, saying: ""There is one rule in football that takes time into account as a consequence at the moment - it's the amount of time that the goalkeeper can control the ball with his or her hands. That's very clearly stipulated in the law of the game that it needs to be six seconds. ""If you see how that law is followed by the referees, I think that there's room for improvement."" Brendan Rodgers joked the introduction of a blue card would cause additional problems in Scotland, with the Celtic boss saying: ""As soon as I saw it I thought 'I work in Scotland so I'm sure they better have a green card as well as a blue one or we might be in trouble'. ""Just don't complicate it. Just make a decision whether it's a red, yellow or no card. We don't need a blue card up here, that's for sure.""

8707,La Liga star gets poked in the a** by fan: 'If it happens in women's football we know what can happen',"La Liga star Lucas Ocampos was embarrassed by a young fan on Monday night while playing for Sevilla against Rayo Vallecano. Ocampos was shocked when a fan poked him in the anus as he went to take a throw-in. The stunned player turned around to scold the fan before calling the attention of the Rayo players and referee. Here's a video of the incident. Ocampos would later call for a stiff penalty for the offending fan while drawing a comparison to what usually happens when women are involved. A good example is the case involving former Spain FA boss Luis Rubiales and Barcelona Femeni icon Jenni Hermoso. ""If it happens in women's football we already know what can happen,"" Ocampos said. ""I held back because I have two daughters and I hope that tomorrow it doesn't happen to them,"" said the winger. ""I didn't know who it was, I wanted to hit them. I have two daughters, and I didn't want my daughters to go to school and have people tell them that their father hit someone,"" the player added. Ocampos is probably spot on. Rubiales was stripped of his role as a FIFA executive and forced to resign his position as Spain RFEF president for kissing Hermoso on the lips during the women's World Cup final celebrations last year. However, the case involving Ocampos was not with a high-ranking public figure but a young and naive football fan.

8856,Chelsea told to bring back Lampard — but there's a catch,"The legendary head coach Emma Hayes is leaving Chelsea Women at the end of the season. It's still unclear who her replacement in charge of the Blues' female team would be.Former Everton midfielder Izzy Christiansen insists that Frank Lampard would be a perfect candidate for the job.“I do have a name in mind but I've never heard anyone throw it out there... Frank Lampard,” she told LiveScore.“He's somebody who knows the club inside out. From my experiences at Everton, listening to him speak, he's the right type of character.“His level of communication and knowledge of the game could be really effective and I think you've got someone well accustomed with what it means to be Chelsea.“I don't have any knowledge on whether he'd want it or not but it makes sense to me. To be honest, I sit in a party where it doesn't have to be a female, doesn't have to be a male - it just needs to be the right person for the job.“There's no gain in Chelsea going: ‘Right, let's pigeonhole this, it has to be a female’. If they want to continue or attempt to continue the dominance they've had domestically, it has to be the correct appointment.”",https://tribuna.com/en/news/chelsea-2024-02-07-chelsea-told-to-bring-back-lampard-but-theres-a-catch/,Aleksei Blokhin,2024-02-07T07:35:03.000Z,LiveScore
9392,Fan violates Lucas Ocampos with finger during throw-in,"A shocking incident occurred to Lucas Ocampos during La Liga's Rayo Vallecano - Sevilla game.The Argentine player experienced a shocking violation when a local fan in the front row at Madrid's Vallecas stadium took advantage of a throw-in to make an inappropriate gesture.As Ocampos prepared for the throw-in, the enthusiastic supporter reached out and prodded the Sevilla player's backside with his finger, causing immediate outrage from Ocampos.Just look at the fans' reactions. After the incident with the Rayo fan, Ocampos said: ""I hope LaLiga takes this seriously, just like the issue of racism.

9419,Premier League refs will be allowed to explain VAR calls to fans,"The Premier League has received approval to allow referees to explain VAR decisions directly to fans during matches, with implementation expected in the upcoming season.Mail Sport reports that IFAB, football's lawmakers, have granted permission for referees to provide explanations in league fixtures after successful trials in Mexico and Portugal. The final confirmation is anticipated before the IFAB AGM in March.Howard Webb, the chief of Premier League referees, has been a vocal advocate of increased transparency since his tenure with PGMOL in 2022. He supports officials communicating decisions to fans in stadiums, a move towards a more open system similar to rugby's. However, approval from top-flight clubs is essential, and the ultimate decision rests with the Premier League AGM in June.The IFAB's approval for in-game explanations follows a year of trials worldwide. Referees, including Anthony Taylor, first utilized the system at the Club World Cup in Morocco 12 months ago, extending the trial to the men's under 20 World Cup and the women's World Cup later in the year.The explanations provided during trials, such as 'following a review, 9 was fouled by 12, penalty to England,' though basic, have proven effective in reducing confusion and frustration among fans in stadiums since the introduction of VAR.'People who wanted it realize it’s been a disaster': Football fans compare VAR to Brexit",https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-01-31-premier-league-refs-will-be-allowed-to-explain-var-calls-to-fans/,Andrii Sokolovskyi,2024-01-31T08:58:37.000Z,Daily Mail
9459,The Best of Sports Memes and Breaking News In 2023,"We are already more than halfway through the 2023-2024 sport season and have noticed that the season has been nothing short of a meme goldmine. Events such as Aaron Rodgers's unexpected injury and Josh Allen's audacious hail-mary passes are visible. In 2024, it’s time to sum up the major sports events of 2023 and the memes that appeared over the last season. Sports Memes and Breaking News In 2023 Do you always want to know what is the biggest news in sports today? Well, you need to stay tuned. But if you want to keep your finger on the pulse of all things gaming, you also need streaming services. One is not enough, given the power outages and regional restrictions. If you had asked me what is the best source for sports news, I would have hesitated. For me it's Reddit, but if you prefer more official sources then ESPN. To follow the sport, you will need a VPN. This way you can access all games, including local ones. Just be sure to choose a no-logs VPN so that your data can't be leaked, queried by the government, or sold. The first one that comes to mind is VeePN; it works well with streaming content and the service’s security is at the highest level. Moreover, VeePN has thousands of servers around the world and has a free trial period. #1 Taylor Swift invades the NFL Travis Kelce's notoriety in the NFL world soared to new heights once he began dating a global pop sensation. The Chiefs' formidable tight end was well-known, but pair him with an international music icon, and you've got an unprecedented fusion of sports and pop culture. Fans typically focused on chart-topping hits were suddenly breaking down football strategies while high-profile spats, like Aaron Rodgers' attempt at a vaccine-related controversy, failed to overshadow Kelce's newfound fame. Amidst more televised celebrations of Swift's than game replays, one might view the relationship skeptically. However, it appears genuine, with both Kelce and the pop star seemingly enjoying a pleasant union. This crossover has not only maintained its momentum but also enlarged the fanbase for both the NFL and the music industry—a serendipitous win-win for the sports and entertainment sectors. #2 Winning isn’t everything In a display of athletic brilliance, the Raiders secured an impressive victory against the Chargers as they dominated the scoreboard with 42 points in the opening half of Week 15. Although they finished the game with a grand total of 63 points, the remarkable feat of scoring 42 within the first thirty minutes is one for the history books. Despite this, it's important to remember that triumphing in sports isn't the sole objective—though the Raiders certainly made a statement that day. #3 Saudi sportswashing wins Despite initial reluctance, the allure of substantial investment proved too irresistible for the sports industry. This year marked a monumental shift as the Saudi Arabian government successfully penetrated the sports sector. Elite soccer talent, with the exception of Messi, demonstrated willingness to compete in sparsely attended Saudi matches for the tantalizing promise of eight-figure salaries. The influence expanded as increasing numbers of sports teams came under Saudi proprietorship. The NBA did not dismiss the possibility of Saudi investment. In a staggering development, LIV Golf—a rival league that sliced through the golf world in 2022—stunned onlookers by declaring an intention to merge with the PGA. This left critics, Tiger Woods included, re-evaluating their opposition. If the thought of Steve Cohen as a contentious owner raises eyebrows, the idea of a Saudi-backed fund purchasing major league baseball or NFL teams takes the debate to new heights. Based on current trends, such a scenario may unfold sooner than anticipated. #4 Rise of women’s sports The longstanding belief that women's sports would thrive with increased visibility and media coverage seems to be more than just a theory—it's a reality. This year’s triumphs in women's sports underscore this point vividly. Take, for instance, the awe-inspiring success of the Women's World Cup, which captivated audiences globally despite the US team's unexpected results. Then there was the record-shattering volleyball game at the University of Nebraska, which drew the largest crowd ever for a women's sporting event. It's clear that superstars such as tennis phenomenon Coco Gauff, gymnast extraordinaire Simone Biles, and basketball powerhouse A'ja Wilson are not just excelling—they're elevating the profile of their respective sports. But perhaps the most electrifying moment this year was the women's basketball Final Four. It featured a showdown between Iowa’s Caitlin Clark and LSU’s Angel Reese—athletes who are rewriting the narrative for women’s basketball. Although I had to watch it through VPN free Chrome, I don't regret anything. Their face-off attracted legions of new fans, proving that when it comes to thrilling sports moments, those featuring women athletes are not to be underestimated. The evidence is clear: people are eager to watch women's sports; they've always been ready. #5 Head coach gets the halftime zoomies In a notable Week 2 performance, running back Raheem Mostert delivered an impressive stat line of 18 carries for 121 yards and two touchdowns against the New England Patriots. However, despite Mostert's exceptional performance on the field, the media focus shifted away from the player's achievements. The spotlight was instead captured by Head Coach Mike McDaniel's unique reaction post halftime interview, where he was seen making a swift exit from the camera's gaze. McDaniel has been the subject of various internet memes throughout the season, and this particular incident was no exception, garnering significant attention in the lead-up to Halloween. Conclusion Naturally, the purpose of the article was not to retell everything related to the last sports season. These are simply the memes and notable events that come to mind when we talk about the 2023-2024 season.

9506,Samuel Eto'o implicated in match-fixing scandal rocking Cameroonian football,"Barcelona icon Samuel Eto'o has been implicated in a match-fixing scandal in Cameroon involving the ex-player and other high-ranking members of the Cameroonian Football Federation Fecafoot, The Athletic exclusively reveals. WhatsApp messages, emails and voice recordings exchanged between Eto'o and a former Fecafoot executive have been provided as evidence accusing the ex-footballer of abuse of power, match-fixing, threats and inciting violence. The evidence has already been sent to FIFA’s Ethics Committee in a comprehensive petition as far back as July 2023 by former vice-president Fecafoot Henry Njalla Quan Junior and some other members of the Cameroon FA. The matter is also being investigated by CAF, Africa's football governing body. Njalla Quan Junior claims Eto'o fixed a match between his team Njalla Quan Sports Academy and Kumba City FC. Eto'o allegedly made a phone call to the referees at halftime during the game after which two dubious penalties were awarded and five red cards were shown to the opposition team. After the evidence was sent to FIFA, an associate of Eto'o reportedly texted Quan Junior with a threatening message. The message reads, “I am a mafia of this revolution and in this specific mafia we do not betray our leaders. I have protected the interest of our mission till date. However, if you f**k with me be ready to carry the load of the circumstances.”A 19-page letter sent to FIFA also accuses Eto'o of corruption since he became president of Cameroon's football association. The letter signed by nine members of Fecafoot also accuses FIFA of not treating the matter quickly enough. They cited the case of Spanish FA boss Luis Rubiales who was handed a 90-day suspension within weeks of being accused of sexual harassment for kissing Barca icon Jenni Hermoso on the lips at the Women's World Cup final in September. Eto'o and his lawyers are yet to respond to the hefty accusations amid overwhelming evidence but the investigation remains ongoing.

9635,From Matthew McConaughey to Robbie Williams: The new superstar trend is football investment,"Forget flashy sports cars and expensive handbags: the new must-have celebrity accessory is a football team.British singer Robbie Williams wants to continue this trend with FC Port Vale . The singer was named president of the club last weekend and hinted that a lucrative streaming TV series could be on the cards.                                       Robbie Williams is about to follow the example of Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, who bought Wrexham and launched a show called Welcome to Wrexham on Netflix.                                       Robbie is not alone in his love of football: Sir Elton John became chairman and managing director of Watford in 1976, which he financed until 2002.Until last year, TV chef Delia Smith and her husband owned 53 per cent - a majority stake they acquired in 1996 - of Norwich City.In August, American football legend Tom Brady acquired a minority stake in Birmingham City.Rapper Stormzy became part owner of Croydon Athletic last year.                                   Oscar winner Natalie Portman co-founded the US women's team Angel City in 2020 and describes it as one of the most unusual adventures of her life.                                   Natalie has several investors on her side, including venture capitalist Kara Nortman and entrepreneur Julie Uhrman, as well as celebrities such as Eva Longoria, Jessica Chastain, Jennifer Garner, America Ferrera and Uzo Aduba.                                      Hollywood star Michael B. Jordan, known from the films Creed and Black Panther, has invested in Bournemouth. He is part of a consortium led by American businessman Bill Foley, who bought the club from Maxim Demin in December 2022.     In 2021, Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria and model Kate Upton formed a consortium to purchase a stake in Mexican football club Necaxa. They have teamed up with former Arsenal player Mesut Özil, the former Swansea coach and the owner of DC United, to buy a 50 per cent stake in the Liga MX champions.                                       When it was announced in 2016 that comedy star Will Ferrell owned shares in Los Angeles FC, many thought it was a movie stunt or a joke. But Will Ferrell actually invested.                                       LeBron James is considered one of the greatest basketball players in history. In 2011 he surprised everyone by deciding to invest in an English football team. He acquired a two per cent stake in Liverpool FC for around £5.1 million.                                      Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey became an investor in his hometown club Austin FC in 2019 and hopes the club will be a major asset to the state of Texas.""Austin FC is more than a good investment for Austin, it’s a good investment in Austin,"" he said.

9795,Racheal Kundananji becomes first African to break world transfer record,"In the world of football, record-breaking transfer fees often come with fascinating stories, and Rachael Kundananji's journey is no exception.Just six years ago, Kundananji was showcasing her skills on the pitches of the Zambian Copperbelt Province. Fast forward to today, and she's set to face off against football legends like Arsenal's Jen Beattie and former Barcelona star Asisat Oshoala for a rising NWSL side Bay FC. What makes this even more remarkable is the eye-popping $860,000 (£685,000) transfer fee attached to her move.This transfer fee surpasses the record set by Keira Walsh in 2022, when Barcelona paid £400,000 for the then-Manchester City star.

10022,"Chelsea, Manchester City and a Thrilling Race for the WSL Title","The top two teams in the English WSL meet on Friday night, with Manchester City having the chance to leapfrog Chelsea with a win. We look ahead to the clash and the key battles to expect at Kingsmeadow. Friday evening sees arguably the biggest fixture in the English women’s football calendar so far this season as Chelsea welcome Manchester City to Kingsmeadow in a clash between the top two sides in the Women’s Super League. Only three points separate them in the WSL table after 13 matchdays and Chelsea, who have been the team to beat in the last decade, are looking stronger than ever as they bid to continue that dominance in England. In a title pursuit that has taken on more significance after Emma Hayes announced she would be leaving in the summer to manage the US women’s national team, the Blues want to mark the end of an era with a record-breaking eighth league title in 10 years. Man City, on the other hand, would love to spoil the Chelsea party and pile on the pressure by beating their title rivals on their home turf. They have just one WSL title to their name so far, coming in 2016 when they finished five points ahead of – you guessed it – Chelsea. A win for Man City in this clash would put them on level terms and set up a tantalising final seven games for both clubs. Whatever happens, this fixture promises excitement, drama, and late goals. That was the case when the teams met in October at the Joie Stadium, a game in which England duo Alex Greenwood and Lauren Hemp both saw red. City took an early lead through Chloe Kelly and a resolute performance looked like sealing a valuable three points. That was until Guro Reiten equalised in the sixth minute of added time at the end of the game to snatch a draw – Chelsea’s second latest goal in WSL history (95:08). No side have been as consistently strong in WSL history as Chelsea, and they are on track to add another WSL title to their collection should they continue their current form. That consistency has seen the 2023-24 edition of the side secure the exact same start after 13 league games of the season as the 2022-23 team – winning 11 games and dropping just five points (D1 L1), while even conceding the same tally of goals (12). Man City are enjoying their third best start to a WSL season after 13 matches (31 points), but most importantly they have improved on their record at this stage last term (29 points) on the way to finishing fourth. Much of their failure to finish inside the top three in 2022-23 was a result of their end-of-season form, however. After defeating Chelsea 2-0 at home on 26 March (their 16th game), they went on to lose three of their final six games. Winning at home against Chelsea is one thing but defeating them away is a very different proposition. Hayes’ side have won a staggering 22 successive home matches in the WSL, a record streak that’s obliterated their own, and the WSL’s, previous record of 14 in a row back in January 2021.  Not only would a win in this match against City extend that to 23 home victories in a row, it would also see them set the outright WSL record for the longest unbeaten run at home to 34 games. The sheer magnitude of their success at home and the ability to create a fortress at Kingsmeadow has been a huge factor in the dominance Chelsea have enjoyed in recent years. It’s also no surprise the team they currently share the unbeaten record of 33 games with is Man City, who recorded their own impressive run in 2021. Over recent years, the two teams have pushed each other to the most incredible record-breaking heights, a pattern that shows no signs of stopping any time soon. To protect their position as joint leaders in the WSL unbeaten home record standings, City will have to undertake one of the toughest tasks in the competition – shutting a rampant Chelsea attack out. Only five sides in WSL history have scored more than 40 goals in their opening 13 games of a season, with this current Chelsea side (41) behind only Arsenal in 2018-19 (50), Liverpool in 2013 (44), Man City in 2020-21 (43) and themselves in 2019-20 (42) – all of those went on to win the title apart from City. Chelsea’s ruthlessness in front of goal has been what’s set them apart from other WSL sides so far this season. They’ve averaged three non-penalty goals per game, which is surpassed by only two sides in WSL history across a season – Arsenal in 2018-19 (3.3) and themselves in 2019-20 (3.1) – while only five sides have ever attempted a higher average of shots per game than this Chelsea side (19.8) within a single WSL season. Since expected goals (xG) data became available in 2017-18 for the WSL, only one side – again, Chelsea in 2019-20 (2.62) – have averaged a higher non-penalty xG per game rate than Hayes’ current crop (2.52). Converting those chances hasn’t been an issue either, with their non-penalty shot conversion of 15.2% being the best in the WSL this season and the 10th best in a single WSL season among all clubs. While City are far from slack in front of goal themselves as the second-highest scorers in the competition this season (35 goals, 34 excluding penalties), they don’t create chances at the quality of Chelsea, with their non-penalty xG of 1.87 per game 0.65 lower than Chelsea’s average. However, this could be a case of an irresistible force meeting an immovable object. While Chelsea have thrived in attack, City have shown their defensive prowess. They have conceded fewer goals than any other WSL side (8) and only Arsenal (9.15 xG) have limited their opponents’ chances from non-penalty situations more than than City (9.49 xG). The Citizens’ incredible resistance has been key to helping them stay in contention for the title, and they are defending from the front too. So far this season, Man City have attempted the most shots from high turnovers (41), while the proportion of their total high turnovers ending in shots is also a league-high (19%), suggesting their pick and choose when to press with maximum effect. Gareth Taylor’s side also led the WSL for shot-ending high turnovers last season (62), with their high press something that his team are becoming well known for. Since the start of last season, Chelsea have faced Man City three times in the WSL and two of their lowest non-penalty xG totals in that time have come against Taylor’s team – 0.61 in September 2022 and 0.64 in March 2023. They’ve frustrated Chelsea before, and they could keep their attack at bay again this Friday. The race for the WSL 2023-24 Golden Boot features two of the hottest talents in women’s football. Khadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw and Lauren James could both be the gamechangers for their respective teams on Friday. Shaw is currently leading the race, netting 13 goals in 12 games for Man City, while James is just one goal behind, with 12 in as many appearances for Chelsea this season. Jamaican international Shaw has set the WSL alight since she joined the league from Bordeaux in 2021. Although last season saw her fall short of securing the top scorer award by two goals, after a phenomenal campaign by Aston Villa’s Rachel Daly (22 goals), Shaw has been the hottest scoring talent in the competition since her debut in September 2021. Since that game against Everton, where she made a scoring debut in a 4-0 win at Goodison Park, the City striker has a league-high tally of 42 goals in 51 games – remarkably just one of those have come from the penalty shot. She also leads the league in xG both overall (30.8) and from non-penalty shots (29.2), while only five players have bettered her assist tally of 13, meaning she also leads the WSL for total goal involvements (55) ahead of Chelsea’s Sam Kerr (48). Arguably no player has made a bigger impact on the WSL overall than Kerr, but she is ruled out injured long-term after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury at a Chelsea training camp in January, which has added the pressure on England international James to perform for the Blues. England star James has returned from last summer’s Women’s World Cup hungry to prove she can make the difference for both club and country. Her goal tally this season is just two off what she’d managed across her previous five WSL seasons combined (14 in 51 apps), showing how far the 22-year-old has progressed post-World Cup. It’s both Shaw (0.71) and James (0.51) who lead the WSL this season for non-penalty xG per 90 (of players to have played at least 650 minutes), showing how much of a threat both will be to the opposition this weekend in front of goal. Hayes will look to James to lead the charge for the Blues and she has not disappointed since returning from the Christmas break, scoring a hat-trick against Manchester United last month to keep the pressure on their top-four rivals followed by two more in the 2-0 away win at Brighton on 27 January. James, however, was missing in last weekend’s FA Cup 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace, with Hayes hopeful she would be back for the key fixtures to follow. “She was a little bit sick, her tonsils were up and I decided not to take the risk,” said Hayes. “I told her to go home. She will be fine – you have to make those decisions knowing you’ve got some big games coming up.” No one expected this to be Hayes’ final season when the league kicked off in September, and her announcement that she would be leaving at the end of 2023-24 to take the USWNT job came as a shock. During her magnificent tenure at the Blues, they have won six FA WSL titles, five Women’s FA Cups, two FA Women’s League Cups, one FA Women’s Spring Series trophy and one FA Women’s Community Shield. Hayes has been an ambassador not only for the women’s team but her influence on Chelsea runs deep to its core, highlighted by her being named one of the trustees during the departure of owner Roman Abramovich in 2022. She has been a custodian the club has entrusted in so many areas across her time with the Blues. Hayes admitted the United States role was the “only job” that could pry her away from Chelsea but make no mistake her desire to win and finish on a high is stronger than ever. Chelsea are still in contention to win four trophies this season, including the biggest prize to elude Hayes in her managerial career so far: the UEFA Women’s Champions League. Hayes’ record since the start of the 2018-19 season is quite remarkable. Over that period, she has a WSL win rate of 78.9% from 114 matches and the only manager in recent times to come anywhere close to her was Joe Montemurro, who matched 78.9%, albeit across exactly half the tally of matches (57). Hayes has registered a remarkable 2.50 points per WSL game in that time, with Chelsea’s players now hoping to give her a fitting send off. With the disappointment of losing Kerr, Chelsea looked to the transfer market to ensure they had the firepower and depth to ensure success in their manager’s final season. Mayra Ramírez joined from Spanish club Levante as the WSL’s most expensive player, a £384,000 deal that only trailed Racheal Kundananji’s move to Bay FC and Keira Walsh’s switch to Barcelona globally, and could go higher once add-ons are factored in. A highly sought after forward, Ramírez shone in the first half of the season at Levante before her move to London, netting six goals in just seven league appearances. In Chelsea’s 1-0 FA Cup win over Palace last weekend, Ramírez was a constant threat and attempted more shots (4) and accumulated a higher xG total (0.56) than any of her teammates as she went on to score the winner nine minutes from time. She is still waiting for her first league goal, but there would be no better time to open her account than on Friday night. The player who could provide the chances for Ramírez and someone City will need to keep quiet is Fran Kirby. Only Chloe Kelly (30) has created more open-play chances in the WSL than Kirby (25) this season, while only Kelly (4.2) and Lauren Hemp (3.6) have a higher expected assists total than the Chelsea star (3.4). As for England duo Hemp and Kelly, they will be key to the chances of Taylor’s side. Only Arsenal’s Victoria Pelova (5) has more assists than Kelly, while not only has she been prolific for chance creation for her teammates, but she’s also had more shots on target (25) than every other WSL player in 2023-24 so far. Another outstanding contributor to City’s great season so far has been Khiara Keating, who will take confidence from her performance in the reverse fixture, when the goalkeeper was influential to keeping Hayes’ side at bay until their last-gasp leveller. Keating also thwarted Arsenal last weekend, making five saves in the FA Cup as City knocked the Gunners out with a 1-0 win. She has conceded just eight goals in the WSL this season despite having faced 42 shots on target and has proved to be formidable in the City goal. Opta’s expected goals on target (xGOT) model shows Keating has prevented 3.9 goals, which leads the WSL. Her fine form has forced out teammate Ellie Roebuck from the England set up and the City No.1 shirt, so Chelsea will have to be clinical in front of goal to get the upper hand on Keating. Chelsea are desperate to be crowned champions once again but these two sides look more closely matched than ever in their race for the title. This game is set to provide the biggest marker yet in the race to lift the WSL trophy, as Chelsea seek that magical number eight and City eye what would be a famous second crown. Hayes won’t have forgotten a 2-0 loss that handed Man City with their first ever WSL crown in 2016 and she won’t want to see her side hand them another opportunity to be champions. Enjoy this?

10394,WSL Check-In: How the 2023-24 Season is Shaping Up After Seven Games,"We’re now seven games into the 2023-24 English WSL season, but what have we learned so far? We look at some of the data storylines from the opening months of the campaign. Chelsea have made an impressive start to the 2023-24 Women’s Super League (WSL) season, dropping just two points in their opening seven games. In what will be legendary manager Emma Hayes’ final season in charge of the club, they are looking to win their fifth successive WSL title. Only Arsenal in 2018-19 have managed to break up Chelsea’s WSL dominance across the previous seven seasons, and the opening to this campaign seems to suggest they’ll be the Blues’ closest rivals again. They are already three points behind Chelsea in the table but could close that gap when the two teams meet on 10 December. For Chelsea, collecting 19 points from their opening seven games of a WSL season means this is their best start since the Covid-interrupted 2019-20 campaign (also 19 points). Winning their opening game of the season against Tottenham made a change, too. Chelsea had failed to win their WSL season opener in each of the previous three seasons, including defeats to Liverpool in 2022-23 and Arsenal in 2021-22. It probably won’t come as a shock that Chelsea are the highest-scoring side (23) and the team to generate the highest quality scoring opportunities (22.0 expected goals), but they work the ball into such great areas to score that they have the highest expected goals (xG) per shot (excluding penalties) in the WSL too. Chelsea’s non-penalty shots have averaged 0.145 xG this season, which is the second best across a WSL season on record (since 2017-18), after Arsenal’s 0.15 in 2019-20’s shortened season. They have also had the widest spread of goalscorers this season in the WSL, too. Thirteen different players have already found the net for Chelsea in their seven matches, three more than the next highest in the 2023-24 competition so far (Man Utd: 10). That’s just three scorers off the all-time WSL record of 16 different scorers in a season, recorded twice by Chelsea (2019-20 and 2022-23) and both Arsenal and Man City in 2021-22. Sam Kerr has scored just two of those goals in her five appearances, with Chelsea – so far, at least – not relying on her for their goals as much as they have done in previous seasons. Although she finished as WSL top scorer for Chelsea last season with 12 goals, they contributed just 18.2% of Chelsea’s total – well below her opening two full seasons at the club in 2021-22 (20 – 32.3%) and 2020-21 (21 – 30.4%). Chelsea have a trio of players on four goals apiece. Still just 20 years old, Aggie Beever-Jones has stepped up after back-to-back seasons on loan at Bristol City in the Championship and Everton in the WSL, scoring once in each of her last four appearances in the competition. German 22-year-old midfielder Sjoeke Nüsken has also hit the ground running with four goals in six appearances, including an excellent hat-trick in the 4-2 win over Brighton in October. Lauren James also has a hat-trick to her name, against Liverpool last weekend in a 5-1 win at Stamford Bridge. Her four goals overall are just one away from her WSL total last season (five) and two off her season-best six goals in 2019-20 for Manchester United. When Melissa Phillips took over at Brighton on 7 April, the south-coast side were rooted to the bottom of the WSL table on nine points from 15 games. In the final seven games, she guided her side to seven more points, which included vital home wins versus Everton (in her first game) and West Ham. With safety secured, Phillips has set about changing Brighton’s style and they have become less direct as a result. With seven points from seven games so far in 2023-24, they are already 44% of the way to last season’s final points tally (16) and have shown their ability to cause the bigger teams in the league some problems. The Matchday 6 away win at Manchester City thanks to Lee Geum-min’s late winner came only a week after they were minutes away from sneaking a victory over Manchester United at the Broadfield Stadium – Guro Bergsvand put them 2-1 ahead in the 89th minute before Rachel Williams equalised in the eighth minute of added time. Brighton also led 1-0 against both Spurs and Chelsea until first-half added time, before eventually losing. With the three WSL games before the new year coming against teams around them in the table – Liverpool (away), Leicester (home) and Aston Villa (away) – there’s every chance this new version of Brighton could enter 2024 in the top half. That would be a far cry from their struggles in 2022-23 and testament to Phillips’ qualities as a coach. Last season saw Brighton as the second-most direct side behind only relegated Reading, but they have slightly increased their average passes per open-play sequence and dramatically dropped their direct style of play from 2022-23. Sophie Ingle made her 184th WSL appearance in Chelsea’s emphatic 5-1 win over Liverpool at Stamford Bridge last weekend, breaking the WSL all-time appearance record. That was previously held by Kerys Harrop, who made her 183rd and final appearance in the competition in May 2023 for Spurs but has since retired and opened to door for Ingle to go on to break the record. Only turning 32 years old in September, there’s a strong chance that Ingle will go on to break the 200-mark in the competition but will have one eye on 30-year-old pair Millie Bright and Mary Earps, who are storming up the all-time rankings and have years on their side. Earps broke a record herself at the weekend, making her 172nd start in the WSL and overtaking Gilly Flaherty to take top spot in the all-time rankings. It wasn’t a day to remember on the pitch for the Manchester United goalkeeper, losing the derby 3-1 against Man City at Old Trafford and Earps making an uncharacteristic error for Bunny Shaw’s goal. Since Manchester United won promotion to the WSL with the Championship title in 2018-19, Earps has played every single minute of the Red Devils’ 87 WSL matches. Seven matchdays into the 2023-24 campaign, there are already some standout players in England’s top-flight women’s league. There are opinions on who the best players have been, but thanks to the Opta Player Ratings, we can rank the players based purely on the data metrics behind their performances. The Opta Player Ratings are something we introduced this summer. For a quick primer on how they’re calculated, you can check our explainer here. Of players to have played the equivalent of at least four full WSL matches this season (360+ minutes), Arsenal’s Katie McCabe leads the way with an Opta Player Rating of 76.6 out of 100. No player in the WSL has tallied as many chances created or secondary chances created as she has (20), while she is also among the league leaders for involvement in shot-ending sequences from open play (43) – only teammate Caitlin Foord (44) and Man City’s Chloe Kelly (53) have been involved in more. Second in the Opta Player Ratings (76.3/100) is Chelsea’s French defender Ève Périsset, who has impressed despite limited minutes (368). Only two players have averaged more tackles and interceptions per 90 than she has in 2023-24 so far (5.6), while she also ranks inside the top 10 players for progressive carries per 90 (9.1) and sixth for successful passes per 90 (65.1). Jill Roord (74.6/100) has created 11 chances from open play for her teammates this season – only three players have more – while her four goals put her joint third in the goal charts as we head into MD 8 of the season. Just below her in the Opta Player Ratings is current WSL top scorer Martha Thomas (74.5/100), who has scored six goals for Spurs while attempting a league-high 17 shots on target.

10582,WSL Preview: Five Key Questions Ahead of 2023-24,"The English WSL returns this weekend, with Emma Hayes’ Chelsea side looking to win a fifth successive title. We preview the new 2023-24 season, posing five key questions ahead of the start of the campaign. The 2023-24 Women’s Super League season gets underway this weekend following a busy summer for teams and players alike. Kicking off six weeks after the Women’s World Cup final, there has been little breathing space with players participating in the UEFA Women’s Nations League this week. Arsenal have even managed to already get knocked out of the UEFA Women’s Champions League, with the first qualifying round taking place two weeks ago. All eyes will be on whether Chelsea can win a fifth consecutive WSL title, but with both Arsenal and Manchester City without European football, they will feel they should be able to challenge Chelsea’s four-year dominance at the top. Chelsea won last season’s WSL title with a record tally of points (58), record number of wins (19) and an impeccable home record, winning all 11 games. They achieved that alongside reaching both domestic cup finals and a Champions League semi-final, in what was arguably their most impressive season record yet, particularly in the context of missing key players like Millie Bright, Pernille Harder and Fran Kirby for large portions of the campaign. A key marker of Chelsea’s success in recent years has been their ability to take points off their rivals. Chelsea took 13 points from their six matches against Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal in 2022-23, losing only once, away at City. Chelsea’s ability in front of goal has long been the key to their success, and despite Sam Kerr having a quieter time in the WSL than in previous seasons, they still outscored their closest rivals Manchester United by 10 goals. Part of Chelsea’s skill is in creating great opportunities, with their non-penalty xG per shot of 0.11 the highest in the league. They finished the season with six players on five or more WSL goals (Kerr, Harder, Kirby, Erin Cuthbert, Guro Reiten, and Lauren James), two more than their nearest rival. They also turned opportunities into goals, finishing the season with the joint most goal-ending high turnovers. 3.3% of their high turnovers ended in goals, beaten only by Aston Villa, who finished off 4.0% of theirs. Chelsea went through some big changes over the summer, with club captain Magdalena Eriksson departing alongside her partner, Harder. But they have recruited well, strengthening at full-back with Ashley Lawrence, midfield with Sjoeke Nüsken, and signing a second striker to replace Bethany England – who left in January – in Mia Fishel. With Catarina Macario also expected back from her ACL injury in a couple of months, it is hard to imagine this Chelsea team being weaker than they were last season. Manchester City were the team to miss out on the Champions League spots, and their fourth-place finish was the worst they had recorded since their first season in the WSL, back in 2014. Having navigated a tricky start to last season where Gareth Taylor was forced to rebuild a side that had lost five starters over the summer, including his entire midfield, they go into this year incredibly settled. They have brought in just one more player – Jill Roord from Wolfsburg – while only having one player move on – Hayley Raso to Real Madrid. Man City found themselves frustrated in a number of games last year when they were unable to take their chances. Losses to Arsenal and Liverpool towards the end of the season all but ended their hopes of UWCL qualification in matches where they were arguably the better team. City took more shots than any other side in the division (454) but had the fourth worst conversion rate (15.8%) and second worst accuracy, with just 34% of all shots hitting the target. More precision in front of goal will be key if they are to improve this year. Finding more variety with their attacks could help. City were the most prolific crossing side from open play in the WSL last season, firing in 69 more than any other side (367). Taylor’s side have long prioritised getting the ball out wide to wingers Lauren Hemp and Chloe Kelly, with Bunny Shaw’s presence in the box a tantalising target to aim at. Shaw received 50 of these, 21 more than any other WSL player, while they created chances for teammates on 73 occasions – another league best tally. But finding ways to attack through the centre more often could create more uncertainty in the minds of the opposition and force them to try and defend a little differently. Man Utd (20), Chelsea (17) and Arsenal (15) all made more open-play through balls than City (11) last season. The signing of Roord might allow more of this, as a player who likes to operate in the pocket between the forward line and the midfield, but Taylor might have to switch up his attacking plans to allow her to do so. Brighton have a strong argument to say they are the team who have had the most eye-catching summer transfer window. The south coast club finished second from bottom last season as they tried out four different managers across a single year, but that has not stopped them from attracting some big names ahead of 2023-24. Former Barcelona captain Vicky Losada has joined, as has ex-Manchester City striker Pauline Bremer, along with nine other players making their way down to Brighton. Will the recruitment be enough to change the team’s fortunes? Well, the underlying numbers suggest they didn’t have a huge issue creating chances last season – only the top five teams had a higher non-penalty xG total than them (21.8). The addition of Bremer – if she can stay fit – will no doubt help them only get better in that department. Her last season in the WSL at Man City back in 2019-20 saw her score 10 goals in just 12 appearances, while an injury-hit season for VfL Wolfsburg last term saw her play only 271 minutes of league action, but she still scored five times. Support from Elisabeth Terland and Katie Robinson, both of whom excelled last season, should ensure she gets plenty of opportunity. While their attack impressed, they were let down by their defensive frailties. They conceded the most goals in the league (63), while they allowed opponents a higher non-penalty xG than every other club (41.6). Teams found it easy to build possession in good areas against Brighton too – they had the highest PPDA (opposition passes per defensive action) in 14.3, plus only bottom club Reading (748) enabled their opponents to have more touches in the opposition box than Brighton did (667). This wasn’t helped by goalkeeper Megan Walsh having a difficult 2022-23 campaign. Based on Opta’s expected goals on target (xGOT) model, no goalkeeper in the WSL conceded more goals than expected, based on the quality of shots on target faced, than she did (10.6). Brighton will hope the recruitment of Nicky Evrard on loan from Chelsea can solve that particular issue. Chelsea signed Evrard off the back of a spectacular Euro 2022 with Belgium, where she conceded just four goals (excluding own goals) from shots on target worth 13 xGOT – preventing nine goals with her 23 saves in the tournament. Aston Villa were last season’s surprise success story, improving on their ninth-place finish in 2021-22 to end last season as the fifth best team in the WSL. The starkest improvement came in attack. Their 47 goals were 19 more than in their previous two WSL seasons combined (15 in 2020-21 and 13 in 2021-22), while they also tallied 10 more shots on target last season (109) than in 2020-21 and 2021-22 overall (99). Rachel Daly was a big factor in their upturn in fortunes going forward. Astonishingly, no Villa player had ever scored more than three goals in a single WSL season before 2022-23. Daly wasn’t content with only outdoing that, she absolutely smashed the club record, firing in 22 goals across the campaign and equalling Vivianne Miedema’s single season record in the competition from 2018-19. In fact, four other players also exceeded the three-goal mark for Villa in the competition, helping Daly along the way. One of those was seven-goal star Kirsty Hanson. After a loan spell from Man Utd last season, Villa made Hanson’s move permanent this summer, with even more improvement expected from the 25-year-old left winger. In 2022-23, she was the club’s most creative threat from ball carries with 17 chances created following a carry – a tally only three players across the entire WSL could better. Villa have also made one of the summer’s most eye-catching signings with Dutch goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar coming in. Former first choice Hannah Hampton moved to Chelsea in the summer, but Hampton’s relationship with manager Carla Ward had led her to being dropped for some matches. Van Domselaar was the standout goalkeeper in the Dutch Eredivisie last season, with 15 clean sheets in 20 appearances for Twente. She only conceded six goals (excluding own goals) from 71 shots on target faced worth 20 xGOT – preventing 14 goals with her exceptional shot-stopping. Manchester United had their most successful season as a club last year, finishing second in the league and reaching the FA Cup final. It should have been evidence of the upward trajectory the club is on but instead they seem to have hit a roadblock, losing two of their best players over the summer in Ona Batlle and Alessia Russo. Manager Marc Skinner will have a stiff challenge on his hands in terms of replacing the quality that they brought to his side. United’s success last year was very much based on their defensive strength, with the Red Devils conceding the lowest tally of goals (12) and expected goals (13.3). In fact, only four teams in WSL history conceded fewer goals per game in a season than Man Utd did in 2022-23 (0.55) – three of those teams won the league. They very much led from the front in this regard with the best PPDA in the league of 9.0. As a result, opponents sat back – their average starting distance of teams they played against was 38.8 metres, the deepest in the league. Russo is an excellent presser of the ball, but replacement signing Geyse is also known for her enthusiasm to win the ball back high up the pitch. At Barcelona last season, she made 0.72 tackles per 90 in the final third, the third highest in the team for players with more than 900 minutes. Part of the reason United as a squad were able to play in this way was because they did not have Champions League football. Skinner heavily rotated his side for their midweek Continental Cup matches, and they went out at the group stage as a result. Skinner used a very settled team throughout the season with a combination of luck and scheduling allowing him to have 10 players who started 19 or more matches in the league. Contrast that with eventual winners Chelsea who only had one player to start 19 or more games – Sam Kerr. United have to play Paris Saint-Germain in a two-legged qualifying match before they make the UWCL group stages, but if they do progress, Skinner will have to adapt. He will not be able to rely on such a similar squad and will need to show whether he can rotate his team successfully to fight on two fronts. Enjoy this?

10589,WSL Players to Watch: Five New Arrivals to Keep an Eye on in 2023-24,"Women’s World Cup fever may have now passed following a great tournament this summer, but the domestic game has returned. While the major women’s leagues across Europe returned in September, the English WSL is set to kick off this weekend. As the league continues to become more and more popular, it’s attracted some of the best stars from across the world and is now arguably one of the greatest showcases for the women’s game. This summer saw plenty of money spent by WSL sides in order to tailor their squads for both domestic and European competition football in 2023-24, and we’ve seen some exciting new arrivals to the English top flight. Ahead of the campaign, we pick out five new signings to pay close attention to in 2023-24. Kyra Cooney-Cross became a household name during the World Cup, helping Australia secure their best finish at the tournament. She soon after became one of the most expensive women’s footballer of all time with her transfer to Arsenal. The 21-year-old midfielder helped Hammarby become a force once again following her move from the Australian W-League in 2021. While at the club, she helped Hammarby win the Swedish Cup in 2023, ending a silverware drought of 28 years, before helping them reach the top of the league at the time of her departure. The Australian international has deputized across midfield and forward positions throughout her career but is seemingly being nurtured as a deep-lying midfielder. Here she can serve as a press-resistant, ball-carrying midfielder who is excellent in tight spaces and a very valuable line-breaker. Her spatial awareness when receiving the ball and taking on players allows her to create space for her side. She’s known for her lung-busting ball carries from the midfield, and at the 2023 Women’s World Cup, she recorded the most carries with a take-on (8) and the second-most progressive ball carries of 10+ metres (18) (behind only the World Cup Golden ball winner, Spain’s Aitana Bonmati (20)). Cooney-Cross has great distribution and vision on top of her ball circulation qualities, making her suitable for any play style. She can unlock set defences with her passing and adds goalscoring from midfield.  Her delivery from dead-ball situations (… pay close attention to her tendency to shoot straight from corners) is a further value add. Without the ball, Cooney-Cross reads the game well to disrupt opposition attacks. While her defensive acumen has come on since her early days, there still remains room for improvement in this area of her game.  Cooney-Cross promises to be a pillar to build around for the Gunners in the years to come. She will add press-resistance, ball carrying and creativity in equal amounts for Jonas Eidevall’s side. Manchester United found themselves competing for the WSL title on the final matchday last season, but eventually fell short as Chelsea won their fourth successive crown. They defeated Arsenal twice in 2022-23 and were unbeaten against rivals Manchester City too, which helped them secure their best WSL finish and secure a place in the UEFA Women’s Champions League qualifiers this season, thanks largely to their defensive improvements. United conceded the fewest number of goals (12) and expected goals (13.3) in the WSL last season and their non-penalty expected goals conceded per 90 dropped from 0.9 in the 2021-22 season to just 0.6 in 2022-23. So impressive was their defensive record that only four teams in WSL history have conceded fewer goals per game in a season than Man Utd did in 2022-23 (0.55), and three of those teams went on to win the league. If they replicate that defensive solidarity this season, luck could fall their way. However, Marc Skinner’s side lost two integral players this summer. Alessia Russo, a focal point in attack, moved to Arsenal while right-back Ona Batlle rejoined Barcelona. Both players were heavily involved in United’s final third actions and their departures left the Reds with a mini rebuild on their hands.  On paper, they seem to have done well in addressing their needs, opting to revamp their attack with the signings of Geyse and Hinata Miyazawa. The duo, along with Lucía García, have a lot of appeal, with the Brazilian in particular a purchase that has excited fans. Geyse had the joint second most direct goal contributions (four goals and five assists) for Barcelona in their Champions League winning run last season, despite coming off the bench for five of her 10 appearances in the competition. Her threat within the box is particularly notable. The Brazilian averaged 5.3 shots per 90 in the UWCL last season – only Asisat Oshoala (6.0) averaged more among players with more than 300 minutes played. Her 0.89 non-penalty expected goals per 90 was only behind  Oshoala (1.32) and Stina Blackstenius (0.94) in the competition last season. A feisty presence on the field, Geyse is notorious for being carded. The last three seasons of league action have seen her pick up 23 yellow cards, but Manchester United will look to the 25-year-old’s electric presence to solve their attacking dilemmas and lead the side to greener pastures this season. Roma have been on the rise in Italy over the last few seasons, with their Serie A title win in 2022-23 ending a five-year reign of dominance by Juventus – a team that Roma pipped to top spot by eight points after finishing five points below them in 2021-22. One of the key protagonists in their rise to the top was Sophie Román Haug. The Norwegian moved to Italy from LSK Kvinner in January 2022 and has now secured a transfer to WSL side Liverpool for 2023-24. She enjoyed an impressive summer, deputizing for an injured Ada Hegerberg at the World Cup and finished the tournament with four goal involvements, including a hat-trick versus the Philippines. The striker was directly involved in 10 Serie A goals for Roma last season (seven goals, three assists), averaging a goal involvement every 68 minutes – only Tabitha Chawinga (every 64 mins) was involved in a goal more frequently in the competition in 2022-23 of those that played at least 500 minutes. Her combined non-penalty expected goals (xG) and expected assists (xA) average of 0.73 per 90 was the second best among players at Roma last season, behind only Daniela Sabatino.  But it was her presence in the box that will excite Liverpool fans for the season ahead. Only two players in Serie A last season to play at least 500 minutes averaged more touches in the opposition box per 90 than her (7.8), which is double any Liverpool player in WSL last season (Katie Stengel had 3.9 per 90). She uses her 5-foot-10 frame intelligently to dominate opposition defenders and attack crosses to win the first contact. This not only makes her a viable box threat but also adds a valuable outlet for her teams. She has very good back-to-goal play, making route one football a feasible Plan B for teams, while she is also able to hold up the ball and bring her teammates into play with smart lay-offs. She scored the most headed goals in Serie A across 2022-23 (six) and had the most headed shots (22). No player averaged more aerial duels won than the Norwegian (4.3 per 90) in the Serie A last season, with Haug winning 33 of her 56 contested aerial duels. Matt Beard’s Liverpool scored more of their WSL goals via headers (29%) than any other team in the league last season, while they also relied on headed shots more than everyone else, with a quarter (21/84) of their shots on target coming via headers. All of this bodes well for Haug, whose strength lies in her aerial ability. A fractured nose from the second game of the UEFA Women’s Nations League with Norway might keep her out at the start of the season but Haug will be causing opposition defences problems in no time. Aston Villa were one of the biggest surprises of last season under manager Carla Ward. While the former Birmingham City manager has a reputation of building a solid defensive unit, it was their attack that blew everyone out of the water last season.  The Villains outperformed their non-penalty expected goals by a margin of 17, an overperformance behind only Chelsea (22) and Manchester United (19). Rachel Daly equalled Vivianne Miedema’s single-season goalscoring record in the WSL by scoring 22 goals from an xG of 12.7, the biggest overperformance in the league, on the way to winning the Golden Boot. While these unsustainable levels of overperformance in their underlying attacking numbers was at the crux of their performance in the league in the 2022-23 season, the Villains have recruited well to help them overperform on the other end of the field with Daphne van Domselaar, a well-regarded goalkeeper who has a history of overperforming between the sticks.  After replacing the injured Sari van Veenendaal at the Euros last year, van Domselaar has gone on to establish herself as one of the top shot stoppers in the world. The young Dutch goalkeeper was part of the best defence in the Vrouwen Eredivisie last season, conceding just six goals in 20 games with Twente.  Over the three seasons in which Opta have data for the Vrouwen Eredivisie, van Domselaar has prevented a league-high 10 opposition goals with her saves, based on our expected goals on target model, with 42 goals conceded (excluding own goals) from an xGOT total of 52. She’s also kept the most clean sheets, with 31 in 59 appearances for Twente over that period (53%). The 23-year-old also impressed at the FIFA Women’s World Cup and produced some incredible performances, most notably against South Africa where her seven saves helped the Orange Lionesses progress to the next round. Her reflex saves from close range papered over the gaps in the Dutch defence. Van Domselaar has amazing hand-eye coordination and does well in one-on-one situations to defend her goal.  When your country’s top goalscorer is singing your praises on social media, you know you’re doing something right… Daphne… 😮‍💨👏🏽🦁 #NEDENG The departures of captain Magda Eriksson and the talents of Pernille Harder would hit any team hard, even the reigning WSL champions. However, Chelsea have done a splendid job of refreshing their squad this summer following some big-name departures. While the headlines were grabbed by their goalkeeper window shopping and the big-name arrival of USWNT star Catarina Macario, a 23-year-old German is arguably their most sensible coup in the summer. Sjoeke Nüsken has been an ever-reliable and versatile presence for Frankfurt across the last two seasons. Having spent years as a midfielder, she is an able deputy at centre-back, a role she exclusively played last season in Germany last season. Nüsken played the second most minutes (1,965) in the Frauen Bundesliga last season, behind only Bayern Munich’s Glodis Viggosdottir (1,980). Over the last three seasons, Nüsken has never played fewer than 77% of the available league minutes, starting every single game in the last two seasons. While her availability is impeccable, her importance to Frankfurt went beyond that. She was at the heart of their possession-based sequences and gave her side the ability to build out from the back. The young German is also excellent at reading play and can be frequently seen regaining possession for her side. No player started more open-play sequences in the Frauen Bundesliga last season than Nüsken (384), highlighting how she recovered the ball and kickstarted things for the German side. Nüsken also ranked fourth for open play build-up involvement (1,140) in the league last season. Her distribution is on-point as well. A tennis player in her youth, she is quick to identify and look for direct options in behind. She ranked third in the Bundesliga last season for long passes per 90 (13.2) and fifth for forward passes per 90 (29.2). This bodes well for Chelsea who have increasingly shown an affinity for playing a direct style to feed the talents of Sam Kerr in attack. During the 2022-23 season, Chelsea averaged 89 long passes per game, the highest in the league, while only Arsenal (62.4%) had a better completion rate than the Blues (62.0%). Hayes has been vocal about the quality of Nüsken and has hinted towards seeing her in a midfield role for the side. With the qualities of the German, this seems like a happy marriage between the two. German midfielder Sjoeke Nusken will join Chelsea from 1 July, on a three-year deal. Emma Hayes says: ""Sjoeke is a fantastic young midfield player. She’s dynamic, good aerially, and is going to be a fantastic signing for this club."" #BarclaysWSL #CFC The WSL has seen a massive influx of talent this season. Beyond the aforementioned names, there are players all throughout the league that guarantee to improve their respective sides. Finnish box-to-box midfielder Olga Ahtinen and Swiss centre-back Luana Bühler will be vital assets to Spurs, adding passing verve to the side’s play. Belgian Justine Vanhaevermaet and two-time UWCL winner Janice Cayman will add experience and depth in equal quantity for Brian Sorensen’s Everton and Willie Kirk’s Leicester City respectively.  Cooney-Cross isn’t the only W-league export ready to make waves in the WSL this season with Mackenzie Hawkesby, a versatile and well-rounded midfielder, joining Brighton as well. Another spectacular season of the Women’s Super League awaits. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new football newsletter to receive exclusive weekly content.

10713,"Stat, Viz, Quiz 3: Phil Foden, Spain Success and Table Toppers","It’s time once again for your weekly dose of SVQ. Recommended to be consumed with food, a cup of tea/coffee and a positive, stat-cuddling attitude. It was another exciting weekend of football across the globe, with the Bundesliga and Serie A getting under way just as the FIFA Women’s World Cup was coming to an end. Harry Kane showed the world what €100 million can buy you, while Enzo Fernández and Moisés Caicedo showed that €260m can’t buy you everything (we’re sure they’ll come good, Chelsea fans; please don’t ask your owners to buy us out and turn SVQ into a ‘Wonderful World of Amortisation’ newsletter!) This week, we look at Phil Foden’s impressive showing for Manchester City against Newcastle United, we’ve got a world champion viz (or two), and a quiz all about those who have led the way. So, grab a snack, boil the kettle and get ready to cosy up to some numbers. If you haven’t done so already, you can subscribe below and receive Stat, Viz, Quiz direct to your inbox every week: Manchester City fans have been used to watching football with almost permanent smiles on their faces in recent years. Whenever City play, fans know there is a pretty good chance they’ll be presented with a trophy shortly after. It was always going to take something bad to shake that mood. Kevin De Bruyne walking off the pitch injured in the opening-day victory at Burnley last week, just as he had done in last season’s UEFA Champions League final, was not something City fans will have been pleased to witness. That feeling of dread will only have been compounded when Pep Guardiola confirmed that the Belgian maestro will be out for “months”. However, Saturday’s 1-0 win over Newcastle United will have gone some way to allaying fears that City could struggle without their chief creator, as Phil Foden took his opportunity to step into the breach. The 23-year-old struggled to hold down a regular place in the treble-winning team last season, starting just 22 of his 32 Premier League appearances, and starting only three times in the Champions League. He has been in the first XI for both league games so far in 2023-24 though, and on Saturday, he broke a personal record. Foden created seven open-play chances against Newcastle, including setting up Julián Álvarez for the winner in the 31st minute. It is the most open-play chances Foden has ever recorded in a single Premier League game, in what was his 131st appearance in the competition. It would be a lot to expect him to keep up that level of creativity – he averaged 1.9 open-play chances created per 90 minutes in the Premier League last season, while De Bruyne averaged 2.5 per 90. It appears to be a sign that Foden is in the mood to cement his place back in the City team regularly though, which can only be good news for the fans and bad news for nearby defenders. The insights in this section come from our new Opta Vision tool. An impressive performance from Spain on Sunday saw them lift their first ever FIFA Women’s World Cup. Olga Carmona’s fine strike was enough to beat England 1-0 in the final in Sydney, making Spain just the fifth nation to win the tournament since it began in 1991. It also meant they became just the second side to be crowned champions of the Women’s World Cup despite losing in the group stage, with Spain having to bounce back from a chastening 4-0 defeat to Japan. Funnily enough, the only other team to do the same was Japan in 2011. They also impressively ended Sarina Wiegman’s outstanding record as England boss, handing the Dutch coach her first competitive loss since taking charge in September 2021. The Lionesses had gone 29 competitive games without defeat since losing against Spain in the SheBelieves Cup in March 2020 (W25 D4). Key to Spain’s success down under was their ability to execute line-breaking passes. Their 655 across the tournament was comfortably the most (ahead of England’s 550) at an average of 93.6 per game, showing how often they were able to get through opposition defences all over the pitch to turn them around and potentially create chances. They were slightly down on that average in the final, with 71 LBPs, but that was more than the 63 managed by England, and as the below bonus viz shows, captain Carmona was central to Spain’s approach, not just because of her excellent goal. The 23-year-old – who became the fourth-youngest player to score in a WWC final – made 49 LBPs across the tournament, including 11 in the final. Brighton’s 4-1 win at Wolves on Saturday sent them to the top of the Premier League, ending the day top of the English top flight for the first time in their history, and making them the 53rd different team to do so. With that in mind, this week’s quiz is based on those who have also led the old First Division/the Premier League. If you listened to this week’s The Data Day podcast, you will already know the answers to two of them. Answers are at the bottom of the page. 1. Name the top 10 teams to have been at the head of England’s top flight for the most days in history? 2. Which two teams have been top of England’s top flight for just one day each? (Clue: They are both from the Premier League era) 3. A team called ‘United’ could also be called ‘Devils’ as they have spent 666 days top of England’s top flight in their history. They’re not from Manchester, though. Which team? 4. Which two north-west clubs are the only two current non-league sides to have led England’s top flight at some point in their history? 5. Two Welsh sides have previously sat top of English football, but who out of Cardiff City and Swansea City has done so for more days? On this week’s podcast, Graham Bell, Matt Furniss and David Segar review the weekend’s Premier League action, discussing yellow cards, Mohamed Salah and British sitcom Birds of a Feather… obviously. This week’s question was sent to us on X by @DietDrBurpsi, who asks: “Which league has the most natives to travel abroad? Like Germans leaving Bundesliga, English from PL etc.” Email us at editors@theanalyst.com or message us on X @OptaAnalyst if you’d like a stat query answered or would like to see a specific data viz and we’ll pick the best one. Answer: Well Doctor, I hope you’ll appreciate that we’ll just go with Europe’s top five leagues for this one, otherwise it could be a very long answer.If a player is on loan for the 2023-24 season, we have counted their loan club rather than their parent club. While more and more English players are making moves abroad these days, with the highest profile being Jude Bellingham and more recently, Harry Kane, they are still trailing other countries for exports. There are currently just 17 English players registered to clubs across Ligue 1 (5), the Bundesliga (5), Serie A (5) and La Liga (2). Italians aren’t any more adventurous, also with only 17 taking up residency in the other top five European leagues of Ligue 1 (4), the Bundesliga (2), the Premier League (9) and La Liga (2). There are 23 German players spread across Ligue 1 (3), the Premier League (11) Serie A (5) and La Liga (4). After being all the rage a decade or so ago, Spanish players are still fairly sought after compared to other nationalities. There are 60 Spaniards plying their trade in Ligue 1 (13), the Bundesliga (5), the Premier League (26) and Serie A (16). However, by far the most popular nationality, with an almost insatiable willingness to travel, is the French. It makes sense given their outstanding production of talent in recent years, with 115 French players currently registered to clubs in the Bundesliga (28), the Premier League (30), Serie A (37) and La Liga (20).

10717,Women’s World Cup Hat-Tricks: The Facts,"We look back at all the need-to-know facts surrounding hat-tricks at the Women’s World Cup. Well, the real answer for this one would be long. There have been 27 hat-tricks scored in Women’s World Cup history, but all 27 have been netted by different players. From the first in 1991 – scored by Italy’s Carolina Morace – until the most recent one – scored by France’s Kadidiatou Diani in 2023 – nobody has yet been able to repeat the feat. Despite there being five players involved in the 2023 Women’s World Cup who had previously netted hat-tricks in the tournament – Switzerland pair Fabienne Humm and Ramona Bachmann, USA’s Alex Morgan, Italy’s Cristiana Girelli and Australia’s Sam Kerr – none were able to add to their tallies.  In the case of Morgan, her previous hat-trick in the tournament came as part of a five-goal haul in a record 13-0 win against Thailand in 2019. That remains the joint-record for most goals in a single game at the Women’s World Cup – shared with fellow American Michelle Akers – and it came in the USWNT’s opening group stage game of the last tournament. There have been four instances of multiple hat-trick scorers in a single game at the Women’s World Cup, with all four being teammate duos. The first to do it – as the historical entertainers that they are – were Brazil pair Sissi and Pretinha, who both netted hat-tricks in a 7-1 win over Mexico in 1999. The most recent instance came in the 2015 tournament, with Swiss duo Fabienne Humm and Ramona Bachmann both doing so against Ecuador in a 10-1 victory. Indeed, Humm’s treble in this match remains the quickest ever hat-trick scored at the Women’s World Cup – just 247 seconds separated her first and third goals in the game. Germany, meanwhile, are the only nation who have achieved the feat of multiple hat-trick scorers on more than one occasion. Accounting for two of the four overall, they did so in 2007 against Argentina through Sandra Smisek and Birgit Prinz, before repeating it in 2015 with Anja Mittag and Célia Sasic against Ivory Coast. Only one player has netted a hat-trick in the showpiece of this tournament, and she wasn’t hanging around in achieving the feat. In the 2015 final against Japan, it took the United States’ Carli Lloyd just over a quarter of an hour into the game to complete her treble. After securing a brace within the opening five minutes to set her team on the way, Lloyd netted her third in the 16th minute to confirm her place in history. In fact, Lloyd’s hat-trick in the 2015 final was only the second instance of a player scoring more than once in a Women’s World Cup final, never mind a treble. It had been almost 14 years since Michelle Akers’ brace in the 1991 final, before Lloyd matched it and then surpassed it within 16 minutes of kick-off. A World Cup final hat-trick is a very rare beast, but after Kylian Mbappé’s feat in the men’s final back in December 2022, perhaps inspiration won’t be in short supply… Marta is the all-time top scorer at the Women’s World Cup, netting a record 17 times for Brazil. She has scored at the tournament as a teenager, in her 20s, and in her 30s. She’s scored the most braces of any player (five), and no-one has netted in more different games overall (12). And yet, a World Cup hat-trick evaded her. Ironically, there are eight players in Women’s World Cup history whose only goals in the competition have come courtesy of a single hat-trick. Four of those – in the form of Kristin Sandberg, Mio Otani, Gaelle Enganamouit and Ary Borges – all scored hat-tricks on their debuts in the tournament and then (to date) never scored again. The fleeting nature of the scoring touch… Inka Grings became the first German player to score a hat-trick at the Women’s World Cup, courtesy of her three goals against Mexico in 1997. And to this day, she remains the youngest player to have scored a hat-trick at the tournament. Grings was just 20 years and 237 days old at the time of netting her treble, which came in an eventual 6-0 win against Mexico. She netted the opening goal of the game, added another in the 57th minute, and then capped off the rout with an added time strike to complete her hat-trick. Grings remains the only under-21 player to have scored a hat-trick at the Women’s World Cup. At the other end of the spectrum, the 2019 tournament saw Brazil’s Cristiane become the oldest hat-trick scorer at the Women’s World Cup. Aged 34 years and 25 days at the time of doing so against Jamaica, her treble came in what was her fifth and final appearance at the tournament, having first appeared as an 18-year-old back in 2003. Interestingly, Cristiane is also the only player in Women’s World Cup history to score a hat-trick when it accounts for every goal scored by their team in that game. Her three strikes against Jamaica in 2019 served to help Brazil to a 3-0 victory, while she sealed her hat-trick with a top-corner finish from a free-kick – just for extra style points. Germany account for just shy of a fifth of all hat-tricks scored at the Women’s World Cup (18.5%), having netted five of the 27 in the competition’s history. Inka Grings scored their first in 1999, Sandra Smisek and Birgit Prinz added to it in 2007, before Anja Mittag and Célia Sasic repeated in 2015. USA, meanwhile, aren’t far behind their European competitors having had four different hat-trick scorers themselves. Michelle Akers and Carin Jennings both netted one in the 1991 edition, before Carli Lloyd in 2015 and Alex Morgan in 2019 added to their collection. Indeed, in the case of the latter two, USA are the only nation who have had hat-trick scorers in each of the last two editions.

10718,Biggest Wins at the Women’s World Cup,"It so happens that the four biggest wins in FIFA Women’s World Cup history are also the four highest scoring games in the competition. It’ll come as no surprise to most that record four-time winners the United States feature as both the team to win by the biggest margin and to be involved in the highest scoring match in tournament history. Coming into the 2019 Women’s World Cup in France, the United States were the reigning world champions and opened their defence with a meeting against unfancied Thailand. The USWNT were expected to win, but the way it was delivered sent shockwaves across the tournament. Jill Ellis’ team set a new WWC record with a 13-0 victory over Thailand in Reims. Thailand – playing in just their second World Cup after debuting in 2015 – were only 3-0 down at half-time. Alex Morgan scored the opener in the 12th minute and would go onto score five goals that night – a joint-record in a Women’s World Cup match, alongside fellow American Michelle Akers (versus Chinese Taipai in 1999). The USA stamped their authority in the second half, scoring 10 more times – the most in a single half of any World Cup match, men’s or women’s – and finished the match with seven different scorers; another competition record by a team in a single match. While the USA’s attitude and celebrations to some of the later goals in the match were seen as slightly unsporting by some, this demolition remains the biggest-ever victory and simultaneously the highest number of goals in any World Cup match in history across both men’s and women’s tournaments. Of course, the USA would go onto win the tournament and become the second team to win consecutive Women’s World Cups after Germany in 2003 and 2007. Germany’s 11-0 win over Argentina in the opening game of the 2007 Women’s World Cup was, at the time, the record win in the history of the competition. The pre-match signs were ominous for the Argentines, having lost all three games by an aggregate score of 15-1 in their only other World Cup tournament in 2003 – including a 6-1 loss to Germany. Germany finished this game off early, going 4-0 ahead inside 30 minutes before captain Birgit Prinz netted her second of the match just before half-time to make it 5-0 at the break. Prinz would add another goal in the 59th minute to seal her hat-trick – a feat that teammate Sandra Smisek would replicate later. Prinz’s three goals in this match saw her reach 12 in total for the World Cup and overtake Bettina Wiegmann as the leading German scorer in the history of the tournament. She would go on to add two more goals at the 2007 tournament, including the opening goal in a 2-0 final win over Brazil, to make her the leading scorer in Women’s World Cup history on 14. Of course, that record was overtaken by Marta in 2015 (15), but Prinz remains the leading goalscorer across both men’s and women’s German national teams with 128 goals to her name. The Ivory Coast suffered a baptism of fire in their first-ever match at the Women’s World Cup, with a group stage meeting versus two-time champions Germany. It didn’t go well. Germany’s 10-0 win was one goal away from equalling their all-time WWC effort (11-0 versus Argentina in 2007) and included an excellent hat-trick from Célia Šašić inside the opening 31 minutes – the earliest hat-trick scored in a match in Women’s World Cup history. Anja Mittag went on to add a hat-trick of her own for the Germans in the second half, while more goals from Simone Laudehr, Sara Däbritz, Melanie Behringer and Alexandra Popp completed the rout. Germany scored their 10 goals from 30 shots (17 on target), with the Ivory Coast having their goalkeeper Dominique Thiamale to thank for making seven saves and preventing the scoreline from being much worse. Ahead of the 2015 tournament, Germany’s 11-0 win over Argentina was the only occasion of a team scoring at least 10 goals in a World Cup match. Across this edition in Canada, we witnessed two such matches in the space of five day – this 10-1 win for Switzerland over Ecuador being the second after Germany’s 10-0 thrashing of Ivory Coast. After losing 1-0 to Japan in their opening group game, Switzerland needed a positive result to progress from to the knockouts in what was their first-ever Women’s World Cup finals appearance. Their 10-1 win was certainly positive and entered them into the record books for one of the biggest wins in WWC history. Switzerland’s Fabienne Humm scored three times between the 47th and 52nd minute, which remains the fastest ever FIFA World Cup hat-trick on record across both men’s and women’s tournaments. Swiss star Ramona Bachmann added another hat-trick later in the game, with this being the fourth occasion that a team have seen two hat-trick scorers in the same Women’s World Cup match. As well as the four wins listed above, only one other Women’s World Cup match has seen at least nine goals scored, with Norway’s 7-2 win over Ghana at the 2007 tournament coming in fifth for the highest scoring matches in the history of the tournament. Two other teams have won matches by eight-goal margins – Sweden’s 8-0 victory over Japan in the inaugural Women’s World Cup of 1991 and Norway’s 8-0 thrashing of Nigeria at the 1995 tournament. The biggest win by a host nation at a Women’s World Cup tournament came in 1999, as the United States defeated Nigeria 7-1 in Chicago, while the USWNT also hold the record for the biggest margin of victory in a WWC knockout stage match, as they defeated Chinese Taipei 7-0 in the 1991 quarter-finals. Germany came close to replicating this in the 2003 quarters, but Russia’s consolation goal in a 7-1 defeat saw a margin of just six goals. Only one Women’s World Cup final has seen as many as seven goals scored: The USA’s 5-2 win over Japan in 2015, which is also the highest-scoring WWC final of all time.

10721,All-Time Top Scorers at the Women’s World Cup,"Who has scored the most goals at the FIFA Women’s World Cup? We look over the top scorers in women’s World Cup history, since the first edition in 1991. No player has scored as many goals at the Women’s World Cup as Brazilian striker Marta, who found the net 17 times in just 20 appearances across an impressive five tournaments. Together with Canada’s Christine Sinclair, Marta holds the record for most FIFA Women’s World Cup tournaments with at least one goal – both scoring in each of the last five editions of the WWC. Marta made her World Cup debut in 2003 at the age of 17 years and 214 days and didn’t need long to score her first goal, converting a penalty in the 14th minute of the opening match. Only three players have scored at a younger age at the Women’s World Cup. Marta finished that tournament with three goals in four matches.   In the following World Cup, Marta had her breakout tournament. She scored two in the first match against New Zealand and two more in the second against hosts China. She netted once more in the quarter-final, before Brazil overpowered the USA in the semi-final (4-0) thanks to two more Marta goals, including an amazing solo effort.  Unable to score in the 2007 final against Germany, her Brazil side lost 2-0. Despite this, Marta ended the tournament as the top scorer and the best player, picking up both the Golden Boot and Golden Ball. In the 2011 World Cup, she scored four more goals in just four matches, two of them coming in the group stage. Overall, she scored 11 of her 17 goals at that stage of the competition, more than any other player in tournament history. Marta went on to score at both the 2015 and 2019 editions of the Women’s World Cup, and with his 17th competition goal against Italy in 2019, she became the all-time top scorer at World Cup tournaments, including the men’s competition. The 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand was Marta’s last as a player. She featured in all three of Brazil’s group-stage matches, but was unable to add to her tally of 17 goals as Brazil failed to progress to the knockout stages.  Both American forward Abby Wambach and German striker Birgit Prinz have scored 14 goals at the Women’s World Cup. Wambach is the all-time top scorer for the USWNT, amassing 184 goals across 255 caps for The Stars and Stripes, at least 26 more than any other player and 63 more than the next current member of the American squad, Alex Morgan (121). Wambach made her World Cup debut in 2003, with the USA the host nation, scoring three goals in six matches. The USWNT would finish third, losing in the semi-finals to eventual champions Germany.  In 2007, she scored half of the United States’ 12 goals, including two in a 4-1 victory over Norway to secure another third place. Wambach was a familiar face from 2003 until 2015, and overall only former teammate Kristine Lilly (30) and Brazilian Formiga (27) have made more WWC appearances than she did (25 – along with USA’s Carli Lloyd). Prinz scored 128 goals in her 214 appearances for the German national team, both the highest tallies for her country. In fact, no other player has scored more than 83 goals for Germany in full women’s international football. Prinz scored for the first time at the World Cup in 1995 against Brazil in a 6-1 victory, but the 2003 World Cup in the USA was her most successful in front of goal. That edition saw her score seven goals in six matches, helping Germany lift the trophy after beating Sweden in the final. Prinz scored in each of the first five matches of that tournament, making her one of just three players to ever find the net in five consecutive matches within the same Women’s World Cup alongside England’s Ellen White in 2019 and Heidi Mohr for Germany in 1991. Her performances in 2003 saw her pick up both the Golden Boot and be voted as the player of the tournament. In 2007, Germany successfully defended their title, with Birgit Prinz scoring in the final. That goal, her fourth in the knockout stages of the tournament, would also be her final strike at the Women’s World Cup. USA legend Michelle Akers scored 12 goals in just 13 matches at World Cup Finals, with eight of those coming in her first four games. With 10 goals at the inaugural Women’s World Cup in 1991, Akers holds the record for the most goals by a player at a single WWC tournament. Half of those goals came thanks to her five in a 7-0 win over Chinese Taipei in the quarter-finals, making her just one of only two players to score as many as five goals in a single Women’s World Cup match alongside fellow US international Alex Morgan (vs. Thailand in 2019). Akers eventually fired the United States to glory in that World Cup, with her two goals enough to defeat Norway 2-1 in the final – the first of four WWC titles for the Americans. Overall, only Carli Lloyd (three) has scored more goals in a Women’s World Cup final than Akers (two). Future World Cup tournaments would see Akers move into a deeper role in the United States’ midfield, and the following edition in 1995 was full of frustration after she suffered an injury and was ruled out for the remainder of the tournament after just two games. She would make her comeback at the 1999 World Cup playing five games. She scored two more goals to help her country to yet another World Cup title. Akers played just over 1,000 minutes at three World Cups (1,003), averaging a goal every 84 minutes. Among all players with at least three goals at the WWC, only Carin Jennings needed fewer minutes per goal (82 mins per goal, with six across 491 minutes) than Akers.   Cristiane, Sun Wen and Bettina Wiegmann all scored 11 goals at the FIFA Women’s World Cup. Of those players, Cristiane featured most recently, scoring four times across four matches at the 2019 World Cup in France, with three of those goals coming against Jamaica. That treble saw her become the first Brazilian to score a hat-trick at the Women’s World Cup since Sissi and Pretinha both did so against Mexico in June 1999 (7-1). Another player with a Women’s World Cup hat-trick to her name is Sun Wen, who is the only Chinese player to ever score a treble in the competition thanks to her three goals against Ghana in 1999. At the 1999 edition, she helped her country finish second, as China fell short in the final against the USA on penalties. She ended the tournament as joint top scorer with seven goals and won the Golden Ball. Despite her 11 goals overall, Germany’s Bettina Wiegmann never scored more than once in a single World Cup match, despite finding the net an impressive 11 times across 22 appearances.

10725,England vs Spain Stats: 2023 Women’s World Cup Final,"Olga Carmona struck the only goal of the game as Spain defeated England in the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup final in Sydney. England won the European Championships on home soil last summer in what many felt was an example of what can be achieved when players completely buy into their manager and perform to their maximum for them. Spain proved in the FIFA Women’s World Cup final that you don’t have to have any love whatsoever for your boss, as long as you’re very good at football when it matters. The Opta supercomputer could barely separate England and Spain heading into the 2023 Women’s World Cup final, and sure enough, it ended up a cagey affair that was decided by one moment of brilliance. Olga Carmona’s 29th-minute strike was enough to win it for Jorge Vilda and his team – despite the somewhat strained relationship between players and manager – while Spain were able to keep the Lionesses relatively quiet at the other end. Mary Earps cemented her place as one of the best goalkeepers in the world with a series of fine stops, including saving a second-half penalty from Jenni Hermoso, but it was ultimately in vain as Spain secured victory at Stadium Australia. England came within a whisker of taking the lead when Lauren Hemp hit the crossbar in the 16th minute, while Earps was forced into a fine reflex save from Alba Redondo at the other end moments later. Hemp was trying to make things happen for her team, having three shots at goal inside the first 20 minutes, with only one Spain player (Salma Paralluelo) able to match that amount across the entire match. Just before the half-hour mark though, Spain took the lead when Lucy Bronze tried dribbling forward and lost the ball on the halfway line, with Vilda’s side taking full advantage of the gap left down England’s right as Mariona Caldentey slid the ball to her captain Carmona, who hit her shot hard and low across Earps into the far corner of the net. It was a perfect strike from a chance that had an expected goal (xG) value of just 0.08. Carmona became the second-youngest player to score in both the semi-final and final of a single edition of a Women’s World Cup tournament, behind only Alex Morgan in 2011 (22y 15d). It was also Spain’s 10th first-half goal at the tournament, more than any other team. Paralluelo became the first teenager to start a Women’s World Cup final since China’s Pu Wei in 1999, and the 19-year-old almost made it 2-0 with the last kick of the first half when she struck the outside of the post with a first-time shot from a low ball arriving from the right. Sarina Wiegman made a big call at half-time, bringing off Alessia Russo and Rachel Daly for Chloe Kelly and the returning Lauren James, back from suspension after her red card in the last 16 against Nigeria. Earps was forced into an excellent save down to her left when Caldentey struck a shot from the edge of the box early in the second half as Spain continued to have the better of the final in Sydney, though Hemp had yet another attempt as she got on the end of a cross from Kelly but steered her effort wide. The impressive Aitana Bonmatí was dictating much of the play, and almost scored herself when she hit a shot just over the bar shortly after the hour mark after Keira Walsh had given the ball away on the halfway line. It was Walsh who nudged a loose ball with her hand in her own penalty area just minutes later, leading to a VAR check and a spot-kick awarded to Spain. However, Earps guessed the right way and saved Jenni Hermoso’s penalty to her left. James had been kept quiet by Spain since her arrival at the break until she found herself in down Spain’s right and saw a good effort tipped over the bar by Cata Coll, and that was as close as Wiegman’s team came to saving the final. England were given some hope when 13 minutes were added on at the end of the second half, but Spain closed the game out to secure their first ever Women’s World Cup.

10726,Women’s World Cup Winners: The Past Champions,"Since its first official edition in 1991, the FIFA Women’s World Cup has had few conquerors. Prior to the 2023 edition, just eight different countries had reached the final of a World Cup tournament, with the titles shared by just four nations. The 2023 final, however, pit two final first-timers against one another as Spain beat England in Sydney, Australia, becoming only the fifth nation to win the competition. Here, we look back over all the winners of the Women’s World Cup. The record champions. Having won four of the Women’s World Cup tournaments played so far, and having only finished outside the top three for the first time in 2023, they have dominated women’s football on a national level for the majority of its World Cup history. In the inaugural tournament in 1991 in China, they won every single game on the way to success, with tournament top scorer Michelle Akers leading the way with 10 goals, including a brace in the 2-1 final win over Norway. After losing in the semi-final to eventual winners Norway in the following tournament in 1995, the USWNT reasserted their dominance four years later with a penalty-shootout victory over neighbours Canada in the 1999 WWC final on home soil. After a winless spell of three tournaments across 2003, 2007 and 2011 – an era mainly dominated by Germany – the United States won their third title in Canada in 2015, allowing a new generation of stars to emerge and shine – Alex Morgan, Carli Lloyd and Megan Rapinoe among them. That triumph was followed up by another win in 2019, where they set a new record for the number of goals scored in a single tournament by a nation (26). Thirteen of those goals came in an astonishing 13-0 win over Thailand, which remains the biggest win in Women’s World Cup history. Overall, USA have played the most games (54) and picked up the most wins (41) in WWC history, but the side led by Vlatko Andonovski disappointed in 2023 and failed to add to their World Cup tournament wins, crashing out to Sweden on penalties in the round of 16. Germany’s 2007 title made them the most successful European national side in women’s football. We didn’t need World Cup wins to remind us of that, though. The Germans have won eight European Championship titles in women’s international football, including a dominant spell between 1995 and 2013 when they secured six consecutive crowns. Of their first three participations in the Women’s World Cup, 1995 saw them come closest to victory, but they lost in the final to Norway. It wasn’t until 2003 that they finally won their first title in the competition, led by the fantastic Birgit Prinz, who chipped in with seven goals from midfield. In that tournament, they defeated the USA 3-0 in the semi-final in front of their own fans before Nia Künzer’s golden goal sealed a 2-1 win over Sweden in the final. They secured back-to-back World Cup titles with victory in China in 2007, impressively going all the way without conceding a single goal in their six matches at the tournament – the only side ever to do this at a Women’s World Cup. This victory made Germany the first nation to win consecutive WWC titles. Quarter-final exits in 2011 and 2019 sandwiched a fourth-place finish in 2015, but Germany fared even worse in 2023, when they crashed out in the group stage. Coach Hege Riise will have fond memories of their 1995 success, having been a player in the side that provided Norway with their only World Cup crown to date across both men’s and women’s football. They arrived at the tournament as one of the favourites after losing in the final in the first edition in 1991, but also having lost at the semi-final stage of the European Championships earlier in the year. Group stage success over England, Canada and Nigeria was followed by a 3-1 win over Denmark in the quarter-final – a match that saw them concede a goal for the only time in the tournament. Their semi-final win over the United States – who beat them in the 1991 final – and their final victory over Germany – who stopped them from winning successive European Championships in 1989 and 1991 – not only handed Norway the World Cup title, but also gave them a satisfying sense of revenge. Riise ended the tournament as second top scorer with five goals – only teammate Ann Kristin Aarønes was able to outscore her in Sweden that year. Japan are arguably the most surprising winners of a Women’s World Cup thanks to their success in the 2011 finals. That tournament saw them score just 12 goals – the fewest by a winner of any World Cup edition. Seen as one of the most progressive football nations in women’s football at the time, much of their success came via the duo of Homare Sawa (top scorer in the tournament with five goals) and Aya Miyama (most assists in the 2011 finals with four). Having never won an Asian Cup title and only having reached the knockout stages of the World Cup on one occasion (quarter-finals in 1995) heading into the tournament, not much was expected of Japan, and they quietly progressed from the group stage in second place behind England. Their opponents in the quarter-finals were Germany, who had previously dispatched of the Japanese without any issues. Japan had met them three times in the competition before then and lost without failing to score a single goal. A shock 1-0 win over the Germans after extra-time set up a semi-final tie against Sweden, who they went on to defeat 3-1, and so progressed to the final where they faced the mighty USWNT. Despite falling behind twice in the final, Japan fought their way to a penalty shootout after a 2-2 draw, where they went on to defeat the US 3-1. In doing so they became the first Asian nation to win a World Cup across both men’s and women’s tournaments. Japan came close to winning a second World Cup title in 2015, but the USA got their revenge by beating them 5-2 in the final. Few had tipped Spain heading into the 2023 tournament. Many of the players had previously made themselves unavailable for selection under manager Jorge Vilda just a year ago, but were able to put those disagreements to one side to win the Women’s World Cup in the 2023 tournament in Australia and New Zealand. It wasn’t plain sailing for them, though, as they were thrashed 4-0 by Japan in the group stage, despite Japan having just 22.9% of possession, the lowest share of possession for a winning side at a WWC on record (since 2011). It meant Spain went on to become only the second side to be crowned champions of the Women’s World Cup despite having lost a group stage game during that tournament, coincidentally after Japan did so in 2011. Spain had only ever won one match at the tournament prior to 2023, which made their run all the way to the final all the more impressive. They thrashed Switzerland 5-1 in the last 16, before a much more nervy 2-1 victory after extra time in the quarter-finals against the Netherlands. Another dramatic win in the semi-finals was to follow, going ahead in the last 10 minutes against Sweden, before being pegged back level just before the end of normal time, only for Olga Carmona to fire the winner just a minute later. Carmona would also be decisive in the final, scoring the winner in the 1-0 success against reigning European champions England.

10727,Spain vs England: 2023 Women’s World Cup Final Prediction and Preview,"We look ahead to the 2023 Women’s World Cup final at Stadium Australia with our Spain vs England prediction and preview. It’s perhaps not the final many expected, but Spain against England promises to be a fascinating contest between two teams making their first ever appearance in the FIFA Women’s World Cup final, the first time that has occurred since the inaugural tournament in 1991. Either Spain or England will become the fifth nation to win the Women’s World Cup after the United States (4), Germany (2), Norway (1) and Japan (1). It will also be the third final between two European sides, after Norway 2-0 Germany in 1995 and Germany 2-1 Sweden in 2003. England could become just the second team, after Germany in 2003 and 2007, to win the Women’s World Cup as reigning European champions. They will be up against it, though, with Spain having scored 17 goals in their six games at this Women’s World Cup, 11 more than in their first seven games in previous editions (six across 2015 and 2019). Jorge Vilda’s side have been somewhat leaky at the other end, however, conceding seven goals at this tournament, the most by a team to reach the final since Norway in 1991, who let in eight. Four of the goals Spain have conceded came in their 4-0 defeat to Japan in the group stage, when their opponents only had 22.9% possession, the lowest by a team to win a Women’s World Cup match since that data was recorded (from 2011). Perhaps this could be a blueprint for Sarina Wiegman’s Lionesses. It seems unlikely Wiegman’s team will see that little of the ball with Keira Walsh around. Of players to have attempted at least 100+ passes while under pressure from an opponent at this year’s WWC, Walsh has the best pass completion rate (86.7%), followed by Spain’s Teresa Abelleira (85.5%). Abelleira will be one for England to keep an eye on, having created 23 chances in the tournament.  Only Japan’s Aya Miyama (25 in 2015) has created more at a single WWC since Opta started recording this data in 2011. These two teams have shown so far that competent passing can make all the difference, with Spain (84.2%) and England (83.7%) having the best passing accuracies of all teams in the tournament, while also being the most accurate in passing under high pressure (Spain 77.5%, England 74.6%). Spain’s reputation for passing for the sake of passing is also somewhat unfair, having made 42-line breaking passes into the opponent’s penalty area during the tournament, 14 more than second-best USA (28). England have made the most passes breaking at least two lines (63) at this WWC, though, so both defences will need to be alert and disciplined. Spain’s journey to the final has been made all the more impressive in that it has come in spite of the division between players and manager. That appeared to be on show even after their dramatic semi-final win over Sweden when some players seemed to snub Vilda during celebrations. Wiegman on the other hand looks to have total buy-in from her players, which could be the difference in Sydney as it was in their semi-final victory over Australia. England’s 3-1 win against the co-hosts brought their goals total in this Women’s World Cup campaign to 13, equal to their best tally at a single edition of the tournament (13 in 2019). Should they open the scoring in the final, the writing may be on the wall for Spain as the Lionesses are unbeaten in all 19 WWC games in which they’ve scored first (W17 D2), including winning on each of the last 13 such occasions. Lauren James will be available again for Wiegman after serving her two-match suspension for her red card against Nigeria in the last 16. James has been directly involved in six goals at this year’s Women’s World Cup, with only France’s Kadidiatou Diani involved in more (seven).  James’ rate of a goal involvement every 48 minutes is the best among the 13 players to have been involved in at least four goals at this year’s tournament, though whether she will get back into the starting line-up after England managed so well without her in the quarter and semi-finals remains to be seen. This will be the first time these two have faced each other at a Women’s World Cup. England have won seven and drawn four of their previous 13 games in all competitions, with Spain winning just twice. Their most recent encounter came in the quarter-finals of last year’s European Championship, with England winning 2-1 in Brighton. Esther González gave Spain the lead early in the second half, before Ella Toone equalised with just six minutes remaining. The game went into extra-time, with Georgia Stanway ultimately hitting the winner for England, who of course went on to lift the trophy on home soil. This one is almost too close to call; just what you want from a final, really. The Opta supercomputer has to earn its keep, though, and so has calculated Spain as narrow favourites with a 35.9% chance of winning in normal time. England are given a 33.7% likelihood of doing the same, meaning a 30.4% probability of extra time. Whatever happens, it could be a dramatic finish. Each of the six goals scored in Spain’s quarter-final and semi-final matches came after the 80th minute (including extra-time). That is quite the turnaround considering they had only seen four of the previous 32 goals in their WWC matches scored after the 80th minute. Spain: María Isabel Rodríguez, Enith Salón, Catalina Coll, Ona Batlle, Irene Paredes, Ivana Andrés, Oihane Hernández, Laia Codina, Olga Carmona, Rocío Gálvez, Teresa Abelleira, Aitana Bonmatí, Irene Guerrero, Alexia Putellas, María Pérez, Claudia Zornoza, Mariona Caldentey, Esther González, Jennifer Hermoso, Eva Navarro, Salma Paralluelo, Alba Redondo, Athenea del Castillo. England: Mary Earps, Lucy Bronze, Niamh Charles, Keira Walsh, Alex Greenwood, Millie Bright, Lauren James, Georgia Stanway, Rachel Daly, Ella Toone, Lauren Hemp, Jordan Nobbs, Hannah Hampton, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Esme Morgan, Jess Carter, Laura Coombs, Chloe Kelly, Bethany England, Katie Zelem, Ellie Roebuck, Katie Robinson, Alessia Russo.

10739,Australia vs England: 2023 Women’s World Cup Match Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to this 2023 Women’s World Cup semi-final clash in Sydney with our Australia vs England preview and prediction. Much has been and likely will still be made of Australia’s 2-0 victory over England in April. That was only a friendly, but the result still had huge ramifications. A Sam Kerr-inspired Australia put an end to England’s 30-game unbeaten run under Sarina Wiegman, and that loss remains their only defeat under their Dutch manager. But that was then, and this is now. Given the Lionesses’ mid-tournament change in formation, there is really only one tangible detail that can be taken from the previous encounter and applied to Wednesday’s semi-final in Sydney; that England will need to break down a set Australian defence. That will suit the FIFA Women’s World Cup co-hosts just fine, as counter-attacking in transition from a solid base is the natural state of play for them under Tony Gustavsson. Furthermore, breaking down Australia’s defence wasn’t something Wiegman’s side particularly excelled at that night in Brentford, and that’s something that has afflicted them from time to time at this World Cup, too. The absence of Lauren James – who will be serving the second of her two-game ban – only compounds this particular problem. The Lionesses (520.6) are one of only two sides at this year’s Women’s World Cup to average over 500 completed passes per match, along with Spain (605.0). The two sides’ contrasting ability to penetrate through midfield has been palpable, though – especially once Jenni Hermoso shifted deeper for Spain. England have averaged just 4.8 successful penalty area entries per 90 (excluding crosses) in comparison to Spain’s average of 13.6 (which is by far the highest in the competition). In fact, England have averaged over 50 attempted passes per penalty-area entry, the sixth-highest ratio of any side in the tournament and the most of any of the teams who made the knockout rounds. Australia have looked dangerous when breaking into space ever since Hayley Raso’s early goal against Canada in the third group game – which ultimately allowed Gustavsson’s team to absorb and counter from that point on in this tournament. Caitlin Foord’s opener against Denmark in the round of 16, following Mary Fowler’s spectacular pass to release her is probably the clearest example of this threat – with or without Kerr. Either side of Millie Bright, Alex Greenwood and Jess Carter’s capacity to defend in space could be definitive. Of the four semi-finalists, Australia have averaged both the lowest possession figure (51.4%) and passing accuracy (72.5%), though only Spain had more shots (132) and touches in the opposition’s box (267) than the Matildas (76 and 138) prior to the semi-finals. That combination of statistics – although fairly rudimentary – shows they’ve been happy to cede the ball and rely on excellence in transition. Yet the biggest factor for Australia following opening knockout-game exits at last year’s Asian Cup and the 2019 Women’s World Cup has been Katrina Gorry’s return to the midfield. Gorry’s role is total. She is Australia’s primary ball progressor in midfield and also their engine off it. The diminutive 31-year-old averages more passes per 90 (49.4) and more forward passes per 90 (18.6) than any other Australian midfielder. Her 3.9 progressive passes per 90 are also more than any other teammate. She acts as both facilitator and creator in Australia’s phases of possession. And that’s not taking into account Gorry’s defensive workload, where she leads Australia at this World Cup for interceptions (1.1), ball recoveries (12.4) and tackles (3.2) per 90. All of this does not mean Australia are impenetrable. Of the final four, Sweden had conceded the highest expected goals against (5.44) up to the semi-finals, but Australia weren’t far behind at all (5.40). They’ve also conceded more shots per game (13) than any other semi-finalist, and more than the likes of Haiti, Italy, and China, despite those sides going out in the group stage. Teams have astutely looked to attack down Australia’s right flank – as evidenced by the disparity in Australia’s defensive actions between the two flanks. Raso’s defensive positioning becomes relevant here. All too consistently the Australian winger has been too deep to engage the ball-carrier when the ball filters wide but has simultaneously struggled to block off the passing angles into the half-space behind her. It means Australia’s midfielders of Kyra Cooney-Cross and Gorry have to scramble over to cover, leaving gaps elsewhere for ball circulation and hampering Australia’s ability to restrict territorial gain from the side in possession. Ultimately, the match will become a question of whose flaws are least exposed. This will be the first ever meeting between Australia and England at the Women’s World Cup. As mentioned, their most recent encounter in April, Australia won 2-0 in a friendly, England’s only defeat under Sarina Wiegman so far (P37 W29 D7). England won two contests in 2015, while they drew 1-1 in another friendly in October 2018. The Opta supercomputer has this down as an extremely close encounter but comes down on England’s side. The Lionesses have been given a 40.9% possibility of winning within 90 minutes, while Australia are given a 31.6% chance. Wiegman’s team remain our overall tournament favourites, too. They’re at 32.3% to win the whole thing, ahead of Spain (26.7%).

10772,England vs Colombia: 2023 Women’s World Cup Match Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to this 2023 Women’s World Cup quarter-final clash at Stadium Australia with our England vs Colombia preview and prediction. England find themselves in the last eight of the FIFA Women’s World Cup despite arguably only putting in one good performance so far. It has been enough though, even if they had to rely on penalties to get past Nigeria in the round of 16. They will of course be without one the stars of the tournament in Lauren James though after her red card for stamping on Michelle Alozie in the last round, and her two-game ban will keep her out until the final – if England make it that far. It is undoubtedly a blow, with only France’s Kadidiatou Diani (4 goals, 3 assists) having been involved in more goals than James (3 goals, 3 assists) at this year’s tournament. Sarina Wiegman’s side come up against Colombia next, who have reached the quarter-final of the Women’s World Cup for the first time and will become just the second South American side to reach the final four if they can win this one, after Brazil in 1999 and 2007. In fact, 75% of Colombia’s overall wins at the Women’s World Cup have come this year. Before this tournament, they had won just one of their seven games in the competition (2011 and 2015 – D2 L4). Catalina Usme scored the winning goal against Jamaica in the last 16, making her the outright top goalscorer for Colombia in Women’s World Cup history with three. Usme has attempted (66) and completed (38) more passes ending in the final third than any other Colombian player in the competition this year, so is likely to be a danger England will have to look out for. Without James’ influence, the Lionesses will also need to figure out a route to goal. England’s failure to score against Nigeria ended their record run of 16 games with at least one goal in the Women’s World Cup. However, they have never failed to score in consecutive games in the competition. It should be a stylistically interesting contest. England have had 71 separate sequences of 10+ passes at this year’s WWC, more than any other side prior to the quarter-finals; whereas Colombia’s total of seven such sequences is the lowest of the remaining sides in the competition, despite having more possession than their opponents in three of their four games so far. This will be just the second time these two have faced each other, with the previous meeting also occurring at the Women’s World Cup eight years ago. England won that Group F clash in June 2015, beating Colombia 2-1 in Montreal thanks to a Karen Carney opener and a penalty from Fara Williams, with Lady Andrade pulling one back in second-half stoppage time. England have been made heavy favourites by the Opta supercomputer, given a 63.9% chance of winning in normal time. That said, they were given a 70.9% likelihood of doing the same against Nigeria in the last round and that ended up being a much tougher game than many anticipated. Colombia are handed a 13.7% possibility of winning in 90 minutes, while another bout of extra-time for England has a 22.4% chance of happening. England: Mary Earps, Lucy Bronze, Niamh Charles, Keira Walsh, Alex Greenwood, Millie Bright, Lauren James, Georgia Stanway, Rachel Daly, Ella Toone, Lauren Hemp, Jordan Nobbs, Hannah Hampton, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Esme Morgan, Jess Carter, Laura Coombs, Chloe Kelly, Bethany England, Katie Zelem, Ellie Roebuck, Katie Robinson, Alessia Russo. Colombia: Catalina Pérez, Sandra Sepúlveda, Natalia Giraldo, Ana Maria Guzmán, Ángela Barón, Carolina Arias, Daniela Árias, Daniela Caracas, Jorelyn Carabalí, Manuela Vanegas, Mónica Ramos, Catalina Usme, Daniela Montoya, Diana Ospina, Lady Andrade, Leicy Santos, Lorena Bedoya, Maria Camila Reyes, Elexa Bahr, Ivonne Chacón, Linda Caicedo, Marcela Restrepo, Mayra Ramírez.

10786,England vs Nigeria: 2023 Women’s World Cup Match Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to this 2023 Women’s World Cup last 16 knockout fixture with our England vs Nigeria preview and prediction. England have finally arrived in Australia and New Zealand. Their 6-1 evisceration of China in their final group game was arguably the best performance of the competition to date by any team. It sealed top spot in Group D for Sarina Weigman’s side who now take on Nigeria – runners-up in Group B – in the last 16 on Monday. Alessia Russo’s early strike seemed to settle any England agitation and they were able to cut loose, now unburdened after toiling for back-to-back 1-0 victories in their first two games. The six goals England eventually plundered was just the second time they’d scored six in a FIFA Women’s World Cup match, and they equalled their biggest margin of victory in the competition with this win (6-1 vs Argentina in 2007). Lauren James was once again in scintillating form, scoring twice and providing three assists in Adelaide. Her performance saw her become just the third player on record (since 2011) to be directly involved in five goals in a single Women’s World Cup game after Anja Mittag for Germany vs. Côte d’Ivoire in 2015 (three goals, two assists) and Alex Morgan for USA vs. Thailand in 2019 (five goals, three assists). James is currently the only England player to have registered more than one goal or one assist, and she will once again be crucial to their attacking output. Their last 16 opponents will be Nigeria, who finished as runners-up behind hosts Australia in Group B. It’s the third time Nigeria have qualified for the knockout stage of a Women’s World Cup, after 1999 and 2019, and they are the first African team to qualify in consecutive editions. In the end, their breathless 3-2 victory over Australia – sandwiched between two goalless draws against Canada and Ireland – was enough to see them over the line. There is no doubt that Nigeria will be huge underdogs in this game. Leading their defensive efforts to thwart England will be Christy Ucheibe, who has screened the Nigerian defence so ably thus far. Her 18 attempted tackles in the tournament is more than any other player during the group stage and at least twice as many as any other Nigerian player. She’s also made more high-intensity pressures than any other Nigerian player, and the location of those show how important she is in shielding Nigeria’s own penalty area.  Leading the line will be Barcelona forward Asisat Oshoala, who leads Nigeria for shots (7) and touches in the box (7) at this tournament, despite not starting against Australia. She came on to score what turned out to be the winning goal in that encounter. It’ll be tempting for England to get ahead of themselves here. Germany’s shock exit has blown England’s side of the draw wide open. Should England get past Nigeria, instead of facing Germany in a potential quarter-final, it will one of Jamaica (43rd in the world rankings) or Colombia (25th). They may not have to face a side ranked inside the top 10 until the semi-finals, should they get that far. That’s why the Lionesses are such strong favourites to win the competition according to our tournament predictor model. It currently gives Wiegmann’s team a 26.5% chance of going all the way. England and Nigeria have met just once before in the Women’s World Cup. That came back in the group stage in 1995 and ended with a win 3-2 for England. However, in their other two encounters – both friendlies – Nigeria ran out winners (1-0 in 2002 and 3-0 in 2004).  That was a long time ago, though, and the supercomputer is very bullish on England’s chances in this one, giving them a 70.9% chance of winning the game. For context, the model gave them a 65.1% chance of beating China, and we all know how that worked out. Nigeria have a 11.3% chance of causing a major upset within 90 minutes, while is a 17.8% shot that this game goes into extra time. If you include extra time and penalties, then England have a 79.7% of progressing compared to Nigeria’s 20.3% chance. England: Mary Earps, Lucy Bronze, Niamh Charles, Keira Walsh, Alex Greenwood, Millie Bright, Lauren James, Georgia Stanway, Rachel Daly, Ella Toone, Lauren Hemp, Jordan Nobbs, Hannah Hampton, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Esme Morgan, Jess Carter, Laura Coombs, Chloe Kelly, Bethany England, Katie Zelem, Ellie Roebuck, Katie Robinson, Alessia Russo.

10792,Sweden vs United States: 2023 Women’s World Cup Match Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to this fascinating 2023 Women’s World Cup round-of-16 clash at Melbourne Rectangular Stadium with our Sweden vs United States preview and prediction. Had Portugal hit the back of the net instead of the post in the closing stages of their final Group E game, the United States would have been going home early from the FIFA Women’s World Cup. The USWNT ultimately clinched a vital 0-0 draw to go through in second place behind the Netherlands, but as a result of not topping their group, they will have a particularly tough opponent in the last 16 in the form of Sweden. USA’s total of five points was their lowest ever in a Women’s World Cup group stage, while no team underperformed their expected goals (xG) total by more than the US in the groups (-3.8). They were defensively sound enough, with goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher not making a single save despite playing all 270 minutes, as the only shot on target she faced ended in a goal for the Netherlands. By contrast, Sweden won all three of their group games, including a 5-0 thrashing of Italy on Matchday 2. They’ve reached the knockout stage of the Women’s World Cup for the eighth time in nine appearances. They have reached at least the semi-final in three of their last four knockout stage appearances, with the only exception being a 4-1 loss to Germany in the last 16 in 2015. USA have won their last eight games in the knockout stage of the Women’s World Cup, last failing to do so in the 2011 final against Japan (losing on penalties). Excluding penalty shootouts, the last time they lost a game in the knockout stage was in the semi-finals in 2007 against Brazil (4-0).  Vlatko Andonovski’s side will need to watch their defending from corners in Melbourne.  No side in the groups scored as many goals (four) or attempted as many shots (17) from corners as Sweden, while their overall threat from corner kicks saw an xG assisted total of 3.3 xG from shots direct from those situations – no other side had more than 0.9 (Australia). To put that into context, the highest xG assisted total in the entire English WSL last season was Chelsea’s 2.5, and that was across 22 games.  Overall, Sweden have been clinical with their chances so far at the WWC, scoring a higher proportion of their non-penalty shots than any other nation (19.0%) and averaging a higher xG per shot from non-penalty situations than all 31 other teams (0.18). USA’s Alex Morgan (9) will be looking to become the fourth player to reach double figures for Women’s World Cup goals for the country after Abby Wambach (14), Michelle Akers (12) and Carli Lloyd (10). However, Morgan is yet to score at this year’s tournament despite having more shots than any of her teammates (14).  This will be the seventh meeting between Sweden and USA at the Women’s World Cup making it the most-played fixture in the competition’s history. The previous six meetings all occurred in the group stage, with USA winning four of those and Sweden just one (D1). USA have lost just two of their last 12 games against Sweden in all competitions (W5 D5), though one of those was a 3-0 loss in their most recent meeting at the Olympics in Tokyo two years ago.  Despite Sweden looking better than the USA in the group stage, the Opta supercomputer still backs the defending champions to go through. USA have advanced from their group in all nine editions of the Women’s World Cup and have won at least one knockout stage game in each of the previous eight editions of the tournament. That could be why they have been handed a 44.1% chance of winning in normal time here. Sweden cannot be written off though, and still have a respectable 28.0% chance of victory inside 90 minutes, with an almost identical 27.9% chance that the game will go to extra-time.

10808,Portugal vs United States: 2023 Women’s World Cup Match Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to this crucial 2023 Women’s World Cup Group E fixture at Eden Park with our Portugal vs United States preview and prediction. Following their draw against the Netherlands on Matchday 2, the United States find themselves needing a result to confirm their place in the knockout stage when they face Portugal at Eden Park. Francisco Neto’s Portugal side earned their first ever Women’s World Cup win last time out against Vietnam, meaning they will qualify if they can beat USA, while a draw will be enough in the unlikely event the Netherlands lose to Vietnam. USA usually finish strong, having won their final group game at seven of their previous eight Women’s World Cups, with the only exception being a 2-1 loss against Sweden in 2011, though they still went on to finish runners up that year. After beating Vietnam 2-0, Portugal are aiming to become the first European debutant to win more than one game in a group stage at a WWC since Russia in 1999. They will also try to be the first European team to beat a reigning world champion in a group stage game (D2 L6). USA would need to lose to be eliminated, so there will be confidence in the camp as they remain unbeaten in their last 19 Women’s World Cup matches (W15 D4), the longest run without a defeat in the history of the competition. Portugal’s Telma Encarnação will be one for Vlatko Andonovski’s team to watch out for though, having scored and assisted in Portugal’s win over Vietnam, while she was also involved in 10 chances overall (seven shots attempted, three chances created). Lindsey Horan will be hoping to keep up her knack for shining at the World Cup, having contributed to a goal in five of her six career starts at the tournament (four goals, one assist), including in each of her last four WWC starts. Given it is Portugal’s debut Women’s World Cup, this will obviously be the first meeting between these two at the tournament. They have faced one another on four previous occasions since 2018, all friendlies, all won by USA with Portugal still yet to score against them. Their most recent meeting came in June 2021 when USA won 1-0 in Houston, Texas thanks to a Sam Mewis goal. USA may not have particularly impressed so far in Australia and New Zealand, but they usually rise to the occasion when the pressure is on. They have won all 11 of their Women’s World Cup games against debutant teams as well, with each of the most recent four ending in a 3-0 success. That could be why the Opta supercomputer has them as strong favourites, with a 72.5% chance of victory. Portugal will likely need to win to qualify from Group E but are given just a 10.4% chance of doing so. As mentioned, a draw will only be enough if Netherlands lose to Vietnam (which is given just a 4.7% chance), with a stalemate credited with a 17.1% chance.

10809,China vs England: 2023 Women’s World Cup Match Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to this 2023 Women’s World Cup Group D fixture with our China vs England preview and prediction. England’s performances at the 2023 Women’s World Cup have been solid rather than spectacular so far, but we all know tournament success is about how you finish, not how you start. Two 1-0 wins against Haiti and Denmark in their opening two group games see them sit atop Group D on six points, and Sarina Wiegman’s side are in a commanding position to progress as group winners. They require just a point against China in Adelaide to do just that. Slender victories are nothing new to the Lionesses at this stage of tournament football. England have won their last seven Women’s World Cup group stage matches, and six of those wins have come by a one-goal margin. China won their last match against Haiti, but currently sit third in the group despite having the same number of points, goal difference and goals scored as Denmark in second. The Danes are ranked higher in the group on head-to-head record after they beat China on Matchday 1, so the likeliest way China can progress is to better Denmark’s result when Lars Søndergaard’s side take on Haiti. While the permutations are easy for England if they win or draw, a defeat sees things get rather complicated. If China and Denmark win, all three sides will have six points. Goal difference, goals scored, and head-to-head records would then come into play. The omens for England in this game are good. They’ve won their final group stage game at each of the previous five Women’s World Cups they’ve appeared in and have scored in each of their last 15 matches in the tournament. Should they find the net in this game, they would be the first team to score in 16 consecutive matches in the competition. Whether or not they can go deep is another matter. Keira Walsh was their latest first-choice player to suffer a serious-looking knee injury. Although initial reports are positive on her outlook – she fortunately did not suffer an anterior cruciate ligament injury – many will still question whether England’s depth is strong enough to get them through more difficult opposition. This will be the sixth meeting between China and England across all competitions and the first since October 2015 in the Dewellbon Cup (a 2-1 victory for China). The Asian side have a good record against England, having lost just one of their five games against the Lionesses to date (W3 D1), with that defeat coming in April 2015 (2-1). Despite China’s good head-to-head record against England, the Lionesses have a fearsome recent World Cup record and should be too good in this one. Wiegman’s side are given a 65.1% of topping the group with a perfect record. A point would be enough to still top the group, and that comes in at 21.9%. A China victory – which would be a shock – is 13%.  That figure is very similar to their overall chances of qualifying for the last 16, which the supercomputer rates as a 17% chance. China: Pan Hongyan, Xu Huan, Zhu Yu, Gao Chen, Wu Haiyan, Dou Jiaxing, Wang Linlin, Li Mengwen, Chen Qiaozhu, Yao Wei, Wu Chengshu, Yang Lina, Yao Lingwei, Zhang Linyan, Shen Mengyu, Zhang Rui, Zhang Xin, Gu Yasha, Lou Jiahui, Tang Jiali, Wang Shanshan, Wang Shuang, Xiao Yuyi England: Mary Earps, Lucy Bronze, Niamh Charles, Keira Walsh, Alex Greenwood, Millie Bright, Lauren James, Georgia Stanway, Rachel Daly, Ella Toone, Lauren Hemp, Jordan Nobbs, Hannah Hampton, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Esme Morgan, Jess Carter, Laura Coombs, Chloe Kelly, Bethany England, Katie Zelem, Ellie Roebuck, Katie Robinson, Alessia Russo.

10810,Canada vs Australia: 2023 Women’s World Cup Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to this huge 2023 Women’s World Cup Group B match at the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium with our Canada vs Australia preview and prediction. Australia will attempt to qualify for the knockout stage, a fate that has been achieved by all the previous hosts of the FIFA Women’s World Cup before this edition. To do that, it’s likely they will have to defeat Canada in this match. It’s possible that a draw could take them through, but for that to happen, they’d need to rely on the Republic of Ireland beating Nigeria (a match that’ll take place simultaneously to this) and hope they can better Nigeria’s goal difference. Their World Cup campaign started well with a 1-0 victory over the Irish, but a shock 3-2 defeat to Nigeria on MD2 has left them on the brink of a tournament exit, unless they can find a positive result in this game. Not since 2003 have Australia been sent home from a Women’s World Cup in the group stage, and they’ll hope that all-time top scorer Sam Kerr can be passed fit to help fire them through, this time. Kerr has missed the opening two games of the tournament through injury, and the most recent reports suggest it isn’t looking positive for the Chelsea striker or her national team ahead of this game. Canada have won four points from their first two games, with a 0-0 draw against Nigeria followed by a 2-1 win versus the Republic of Ireland. Adriana Leon scored her first WWC goal in the win over the Irish, meaning she’s now scored 10 goals under coach Bev Priestman in all competitions, more than any other player during her tenure. One player still looking for a goal in this tournament is legendary striker Christine Sinclair. The 40-year-old missed a penalty on MD1 versus Nigeria and needs a goal in these finals to become the first player in Women’s World Cup history to score in six different editions of the tournament. Canada defeated Australia twice in the space of four days in September 2022, both in international friendlies. The 1-0 and 2-1 wins saw every goal scored by reliable Canadian goalscorer Adriana Leon. Canada and Australia will face each other for the second time at the FIFA Women’s World Cup, following a 2-2 draw in their final group stage game at the 2007 tournament. Across all competitions, Australia haven’t beaten Canada since May 2008, when the Matildas enjoyed a 2-1 friendly victory at home. Australia will most likely need a win in this match and luckily for them, the Opta supercomputer thinks they’ll get it – but it’s tight. Australia’s 37% chance of victory is only a shade higher than Canada’s 34%, with a draw (29%) not going to help the Matildas if Nigeria get anything from their match against the Republic of Ireland, as expected. Canada: Kailen Sheridan, Allysha Chapman, Kadeisha Buchanan, Shelina Zadorsky, Quinn, Deanne Rose, Julia Grosso, Jayde Riviere, Jordyn Huitema, Ashley Lawrence, Evelyne Viens, Christine Sinclair, Sophie Schmidt, Vanessa Gilles, Nichelle Prince, Gabrielle Carle, Jessie Fleming, Sabrina D’Angelo, Adriana Leon, Cloé Lacasse, Simi Awujo, Lysianne Proulx, Olivia Smith.

10813,France vs Brazil: 2023 Women’s World Cup Match Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to this 2023 Women’s World Cup Group F fixture at Suncorp Stadium with our France vs Brazil preview and prediction. France eliminated Brazil from the quarter-finals of the 2019 Women’s World Cup, and will be hoping to beat them again four years later after their stuttering start to the tournament. Their goalless draw with Jamaica in their opening game was their first 0-0 in the FIFA Women’s World Cup. However, France have always won at least one of their first two games at previous World Cups. Brazil had the perfect start with their 4-0 dismantling of Panama, including a stunning performance from Ary Borges as she became the only player to be involved in four goals on Matchday 1 of this Women’s World Cup, scoring three and assisting another. Brazil are unbeaten in their last eight group stage matches against European opposition at the WWC (W6 D2), winning each of the last four by an aggregate score of 6-0, and have won 12 of their last 13 games in the group stage overall (L1). They kept a clean sheet in each of those 12 wins, scoring three or more goals six times in that run. Such was their dominance against Panama, Brazil had 13 different players attempt a shot on MD1, the most on record for a team in a Women’s World Cup game at the end of the opening matchday (since 2011). They should have more trouble against France though, who have kept a clean sheet in four of their last five group stage games at the Women’s World Cup. They have also not conceded more than once in a group game at a WWC since losing 2-0 to Colombia in 2015. This will be the third time France and Brazil have met at the Women’s World Cup, with France winning 2-1 after extra-time in 2019 to reach the quarter finals, having drawn the first encounter 1-1 in 2003. In fact, since that first meeting in 2003, they have faced each other 10 more times in various competitions and Brazil have still never beaten France, who have won six (including in extra-time in the 2019 WWC) and drawn five of their encounters. Despite France’s excellent record against Brazil, the Opta supercomputer was clearly impressed by Pia Sundhage’s team and their performance against Panama. That coupled with France’s lacklustre showing against Jamaica has given Brazil the slight edge, with Opta suggesting they have a 36.4% chance of victory, marginally ahead of France’s 35.2% chance. With that in mind, a draw would not seem like the craziest shout, and the stalemate is given a 28.4% chance of occurring, which would not be a terrible result for either team. It would leave France sweating ahead of their final clash with Panama, though.

10817,England vs Denmark: 2023 Women’s World Cup Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to this 2023 Women’s World Cup Group D match at the Sydney Football Stadium with our England vs Denmark preview and prediction. Both England and Denmark started their 2023 Women’s World Cup campaigns with a 1-0 victory. England come into this game off the back of a tricky encounter with Haiti, winning 1-0 thanks to a re-taken Georgia Stanway penalty in the first half. That was one of 11 shots on target that they posted in the victory, which was the most on record (since 2011) in a FIFA WWC match. Denmark only attempted two shots on target in their 1-0 win over China PR, both coming in the final 15 minutes of the game, with the second of those providing the winning goal in the 89th minute via Amalie Vangsgaard. Sarina Wiegman has turned England into one of the powerhouses of women’s football, leading them to European Championship glory last summer. Overall under Wiegman, England have lost just one of their 33 matches in all competitions (W26 D6), with that defeat coming against Australia in a friendly in April (2-0). Weigman’s tournament record as a coach is phenomenal, with the Dutch coach losing just one of her 20 matches across the Women’s European Championships and World Cup combined (winning the other 19) – that was the 2019 Women’s World Cup final defeat to the United States while in charge of the Netherlands. This will be the 18th meeting between England (eight wins) and Denmark (six wins) in all competitions (three draws), with the Lionesses winning each of the last three encounters, most recently a 2-0 victory in a friendly back in May 2019. England’s goals that day came from Nikita Parris and Jill Scott. Despite 18 previous meetings, this will be the first FIFA Women’s World Cup match between Denmark and England. They have met three times previously at the European Championships, with England winning the first two encounters (both in 1984) before losing in 2005 (2-1). Denmark will have to create history here, as they have never beaten a fellow European nation at the Women’s World Cup. Their previous three attempts have all ended in defeat, losing in 1991 against Norway (2-1) and Germany (2-1) and then in 1995 against Norway again (3-1). The Opta supercomputer makes England the favourites for this match before kick-off, with a 66.5% chance of defeating Denmark. A win for either side here will ensure qualification to the knockout stage, with Denmark being given a 12.4% chance of following up their 1-0 victory over China on matchday one with another three points. A draw would be far from a disaster for either side, with both nations facing opposition that they should be expected to defeat in their final game in Group D. The chance of a draw is 21.1%. England: Mary Earps, Lucy Bronze, Niamh Charles, Keira Walsh, Alex Greenwood, Millie Bright, Lauren James, Georgia Stanway, Rachel Daly, Ella Toone, Lauren Hemp, Jordan Nobbs, Hannah Hampton, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Esme Morgan, Jess Carter, Laura Coombs, Chloe Kelly, Bethany England, Katie Zelem, Ellie Roebuck, Katie Robinson, Alessia Russo.

10818,Australia vs Nigeria: 2023 Women’s World Cup Match Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to this 2023 Women’s World Cup Group B fixture at Lang Park, Brisbane with our Australia vs Nigeria preview and prediction. Australia will be hoping to have a better second outing of the FIFA Women’s World Cup than their co-hosts New Zealand, who followed up a 1-0 win in their opening game against Norway with a 1-0 loss to tournament debutants the Philippines. Australia also secured a 1-0 win in their first game, with Steph Catley’s penalty enough for three points against the Republic of Ireland. Should they beat Nigeria as well, Australia will have won their opening two games at a Women’s World Cup for the first time. Following the 0-0 draw with Canada in their opening game, Nigeria will be looking to avoid losing consecutive matches at a single Women’s World Cup for the first time. They had just 32.5% possession in Melbourne, with only one team since 2011 managing to avoid defeat in a WWC game having had less of the ball (Argentina had just 28.5% in their 0-0 draw with Japan in 2019). Nigeria have failed to score in 17 of their 27 Women’s World Cup games, which is more times than any other team. They have only found the net in one of their previous seven WWC matches – a 2-0 win against South Korea in 2019 – despite having 57 shots (12 on target) in that time. Nevertheless, it does seem unlikely this one will end goalless. Australia have played the most games at the WWC without ever contesting a 0-0 draw (27 games), while Nigeria have also played 27 times and only registered their first goalless draw last time out against Canada. Australia completed 80.5% of their passes against the Republic of Ireland, just the third time they have recorded a passing accuracy of at least 80% in 14 WWC games since the beginning of the 2011 tournament. The co-hosts are likely to still be without captain Sam Kerr as she recovers from a calf injury, though Katrina Gorry and Caitlin Foord suggested they can step up after recording five attacking sequence involvements each against the Republic of Ireland. Australia will have to keep an eye on Nigeria’s Ifeoma Onumonu going the other way, though. She was involved in more shots than any other Nigeria player against Canada (5 – 4 shots, 1 chance created). These two met in the group stage eight years ago in Canada, with Australia winning 2-0 thanks to a brace from Kyah Simon in what was their only meeting at a World Cup to date. Nigeria were eliminated in the first round after picking up just one point, while Australia were knocked out in the quarter-finals by eventual runners-up Japan. Australia have won their last three WWC matches against African sides, though the 2015 victory over Nigeria was the most recent. Tony Gustavsson’s side were not all that convincing in their opening win, but they got the job done against a resilient Republic of Ireland, and the Opta supercomputer backs them to do the same against Nigeria. Australia are given a 67.3% chance of victory and securing their place in the knockout stage with a game to spare, while their opponents are handed just a 12.1% chance of producing an upset. A 20.6% likelihood of a draw means Nigeria have a 32.7% probability of getting at least a point, which would at least keep them in contention to qualify for the next round. Australia: Lydia Williams, Courtney Nevin, Aivi Luik, Clare Polkinghorne, Cortnee Vine, Clare Wheeler, Steph Catley, Alex Chidiac, Caitlin Foord, Emily van Egmond, Mary Fowler, Teagan Micah, Tameka Yallop, Alanna Kennedy, Clare Hunt, Hayley Raso, Kyah Simon, Mackenzie Arnold, Katrina Gorry, Sam Kerr, Ellie Carpenter, Charlotte Grant, Kyra Cooney-Cross.

10820,United States vs Netherlands: 2023 Women’s World Cup Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to this 2023 Women’s World Cup Group E match at the Wellington Regional Stadium with our United States vs Netherlands preview and prediction. The expanded tournament means titanic group stage battles are a less common occurrence at the 2023 Women’s World Cup, and this is arguably the most eye-catching game of the first round. Top spot in Group E is up for grabs and it is likely that this game, between the two finalists at the 2019 Women’s World Cup, will decide who finishes in first. The USA beat the Netherlands 2-0 in the 2019 final and, after opening their 2023 campaign with a 3-0 win over Vietnam, have now won 13 straight matches at the Women’s World Cup, a run stretching back to 2015, when they drew a group stage game against Sweden. They have also won seven of their last eight games against European opposition, winning the last six. After enjoying near total domination against Vietnam – Alyssa Naeher became the first starting goalkeeper to have fewer than 10 touches (9) in a Women’s World Cup game since the start of the 2011 tournament – they will be confident of continuing that run even though these opponents will unquestionably be tougher. The Netherlands opened their WWC 2023 campaign with a hard-fought 1-0 win over Portugal. They took the lead early on through Stefanie van der Gragt and never really looked like surrendering it, though a stubborn Portugal defended resolutely and didn’t make it easy for their opponents. The Dutch got the win, though, and with it, took a big step towards the knockout stage. A win over Vietnam in their final game will see them though regardless of the result here; this game is very much a free hit for the Netherlands. The USWNT have a very good record against the Dutch. They have not lost to them since a friendly in April 1996, remaining unbeaten in the teams’ last nine meetings. USA have won eight of those and scored an average of 3.1 goals per game. However, the Netherlands are a much-improved outfit these days, and their run to the 2019 final was no fluke. They aren’t quite giants of the women’s game like their opponents, but having won five of their seven group stage games at the Women’s World Cup (one draw, one loss), including all four since the start of the 2019 tournament by an aggregate score of 7-2, they are clearly no pushovers. Set-pieces are a real weapon for the Dutch, and the delivery of Sherida Spitse could be key. Since the start of the 2019 tournament, Spitse has five assists, all of which have come from set plays. Even though those have come in her last eight appearances at the tournament, Spitse also leads the way for set-piece assists at the Women’s World Cup since the start of the 2011 edition. The USA have tonnes of quality in their ranks, though, and will be confident of another win against familiar opponents. Sophia Smith scored twice and assisted another on Matchday 1, and in doing so became just the fourth player since the beginning of the 2011 edition to be involved in three or more goals in her Women’s World Cup debut game. The 22-year-old could be one to keep an eye on in this tournament. The Opta supercomputer makes the US favourites to win this one, with a 56.7% chance of victory. The Netherlands have just a 19% chance, but with a 43.3% chance of taking at least a point, this one isn’t a foregone conclusion by any stretch.

10825,Brazil vs Panama: 2023 Women’s World Cup Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to this 2023 Women’s World Cup Group F fixture at Hindmarsh Stadium, Adelaide with our Brazil vs Panama preview and prediction. Brazil will be expected to make a flying start to their FIFA Women’s World Cup campaign on Monday when they take on tournament debutants Panama in Adelaide. While Panama are newbies at this level, Brazil are stalwarts. They’ve taken part in every edition of the Women’s World Cup, with this their ninth appearance. No other South American nation can match their pedigree. Given the vastly different reputations of the two nations, there’s every chance this could be a very long day for Panama, who will be intent on keeping the score as low as possible. After all, Brazil typically start the Women’s World Cup well. Of the countries to have played in at least three editions of the tournament, Brazil are the only team to have won each of their opening matches. They’ve kept seven clean sheets across those eight games and enjoyed an aggregate score of 23-1. To be fair, Brazil’s reputation extends far beyond just Matchday one games, losing only one of their previous 18 group matches at the Women’s World Cup, with that coming to Australia in 2019 – that was the only one of their past 12 first-round fixtures they’ve conceded in. Make no mistake, a Panama victory would be a huge shock, potentially one of the biggest in Women’s World Cup history. It would also see them become the first Concacaf nation to win their debut match at the tournament since the United States in 1991. But with Brazil boasting quality and experience, it’s difficult to envisage a surprise. Marta, now 37 years old, fits into both categories and will be chasing another record. She’s already the all-time leading scorer at the Women’s World Cup (17 in 20 games), and she could become the first player – man or woman – to score in six editions of the World Cup if she nets against Panama. An icon of Brazilian football, Marta is set to call time on her international career after this tournament; she’ll be eager to leave on a high. Brazil and Panama have never faced each other before, which perhaps isn’t that surprising given they’re from different confederations and the latter will be appearing at the World Cup for the first time. Nevertheless, Brazil have played Concacaf opposition at the Women’s World Cup before. In four such matches, Brazil have amassed three wins and a draw, keeping three clean sheets across those fixtures. In the past 12 months they have lost to Canada (twice) and the United States, however, with two of those defeats coming earlier this year. Panama most recently played a South American team in June when they drew 1-1 with Colombia. Since then, though, their final two World Cup preparation games have seen them concede 13 times without reply. They were beaten 7-0 by Spain on 29 June and then lost 5-0 to Japan earlier this month. In one of the most one-sided predictions by the Opta supercomputer at this tournament; Brazil are given a 93.8% chance of beating Panama. So, you don’t need us to tell you how unlikely an upset is here… But we’ll tell you anyway. Panama have just a 2.1% probability of winning, while the draw is at 5.1%. That gives obviously gives them a 7.2% likelihood of getting at least a point. If Panama pull something off here, it’ll go down in Women’s World Cup folklore forever – though it’s seemingly rather more likely that Brazil have a field day. Brazil: Bárbara, Antônia, Kathellen, Rafaelle, Luana, Tamires, Andressa Alves, Ana Vitória, Debinha, Marta, Adriana, Letícia Izidoro, Bruninha, Lauren, Duda, Bia Zaneratto, Ary Borges, Geyse, Mônica, Angelina, Kerolin, Camila, Gabi Nunes.

10827,Germany vs Morocco: Women’s World Cup 2023 Match Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to this 2023 Women’s World Cup Group H fixture at Melbourne Rectangular Stadium with our Germany vs Morocco preview and prediction.  Two-time world champions Germany face debutants Morocco in the penultimate match of the first round of fixtures at the 2023 Women’s World Cup. This being the first tournament with 32 teams involved has meant a fair few unevenly matched fixtures in the group stage, and this game has the potential to be one of the more one-sided affairs.  Germany are World Cup heavyweights, as one of seven teams to have qualified for all nine FIFA Women’s World Cup tournaments, while only the USA (138) have scored more goals in the competition’s history than them (121). The USA are also the only other team to have won the competition more than once (USA four times, Germany twice).  Germany have won 19 and drawn four of their 24 group stage games in the competition, with their only loss coming way back in 1995.  Morocco are minnows by comparison, but they did do very well at their last major tournament, when they finished runners-up to South Africa at last year’s Women’s Africa Cup of Nations. They led that tournament for possession (60.2%), passing accuracy (79.5%) and shots (94), and had joint-most shots on target (33).  They may not be able to dominate possession in the same way against better opposition in the World Cup, but they have quality in their ranks and will hope they can spring a surprise  These two sides have never met before, but Germany have a very good record against African teams. They have won their previous five games against teams from Africa at the Women’s World Cup, scoring a total of 22 goals (4.4 per game) without conceding a single goal.  In Alexandra Popp, Germany have one of the most dangerous forwards at the competition, and a genuine contender for the golden boot award. If Germany have things their way, this could be the kind of game for Popp to get a few goals and boost her chances.  The Opta supercomputer makes Germany huge favourites to win, with a 90.1% chance of success. Morocco, by comparison, are given just a 3.6% chance of victory.  Anything other than a Germany win would be a shock. There is a decent chance of a big victory for a side who will harbour hopes of going deep in the tournament.  Germany: Merle Frohms, Chantal Hagel, Kathrin Hendrich, Sophia Kleinherne, Marina Hegering, Lena Oberdorf, Lea Schüller, Sydney Lohmann, Svenja Huth, Laura Freigang, Alexandra Popp, Ann-Katrin Berger, Sara Däbritz, Lena Lattwein, Sjoeke Nüsken, Nicole Anyomi, Felicitas Rauch, Melanie Leupolz, Klara Bühl, Lina Magull, Stina Johannes, Jule Brand, Sara Doorsoun.  Morocco: Khadija Er-Rmichi, Zineb Redouani, Nouhaila Benzina, Sarah Kassi, Nesryne El Chad, Élodie Nakkach, Ghizlane Chebbak, Salma Amani, Ibtissam Jraïdi, Najat Badri, Fatima Tagnaout, Assia Zouhair, Sabah Seghir, Rkia Mazrouai, Fatima Zohra Gharbi, Anissa Lahmari, Hanane Aït El Haj, Kenza Chapelle, Sakina Ouzraoui Diki, Sofia Bouftini, Yasmin Mrabet, Inès Arouaissa, Rosella Ayane.  Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

10830,France vs Jamaica: 2023 Women’s World Cup Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to this 2023 Women’s World Cup Group F fixture at the Sydney Football Stadium with our France vs Jamaica preview and prediction. This will be the fifth Women’s World Cup that France have participated in, with the last three (2011, 2015 and 2019) seeing them progress to at least the quarter-finals of the tournament. Across those last three editions of the WWC, France have averaged the highest possession figure (57.4%) of the sides to have played at least 10 matches, so expect them to have plenty of the ball in this fixture, too. Jamaica will be hoping to improve on their 2019 Women’s World Cup experience, where they lost all three matches. This game may not be the match to improve that record, but their following fixture in Group F presents an opportunity, versus Panama. Much of their hopes will pin on the quality of striker Khadija Shaw, who was one of only two players to score at least 20 goals in the English Women’s Super League in 2022-23 (20 for Manchester City). She was also one of the three players involved in four goals during the 2022 Concacaf W Championship (three goals, one assist), the best tally in the competition. This match will see Hervé Renard manage at the Women’s World Cup for the first time, having previously coached at the Men’s World Cup as coach of both Morocco and Saudi Arabia. He will become just the second coach to have managed at both editions, after John Herdman (with Canada and New Zealand for their women’s teams and Canada for the men’s team). This will be the first meeting between France and Jamaica in women’s international football. France have played a team from the Concacaf region on four previous occasions at the FIFA Women’s World Cup, losing twice against the United States and enjoying wins over both Canada and Mexico at previous tournaments. Jamaica are overwhelming underdogs in this meeting with France – the Opta supercomputer is giving them just a 2.4% chance of picking up all three points, while the overall chance of stopping a French victory is just 8.1%. Of course, simple maths will tell you that France’s chance of victory is 91.9% according to the Opta supercomputer – this is only lower than the win probability for the United States (95.3%), England (93.7%) and Brazil (93.8%) among the fixtures on the opening matchday of the 2023 Women’s World Cup. France: Solène Durand, Maëlle Lakrar, Wendie Renard, Laurina Fazer, Élisa De Almeida, Sandie Toletti, Sakina Karchaoui, Grace Geyoro, Eugénie Le Sommer, Amel Majri, Kadidiatou Diani, Clara Matéo, Selma Bacha, Aïssatou Tounkara, Kenza Dali, Pauline Peyraud-Magnin, Léa Le Garrec, Viviane Asseyi, Naomie Feller, Estelle Cascarino, Constance Picaud, Ève Périsset, Vicki Bècho.

10831,Netherlands vs Portugal: 2023 Women’s World Cup Match Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to this 2023 Women’s World Cup Group E fixture at the Forsyth Barr Stadium, Dunedin with our Netherlands vs Portugal preview and prediction.  The Netherlands – losing finalists at the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup – start their campaign this time around against fellow UEFA nation Portugal. This will be their third Women’s World Cup tournament, and to make a change, they won’t be facing New Zealand in the opening game – just like they did in both 2015 and 2019, winning 1-0 both times.  Of course, Andries Jonker’s side are missing star player and all-time record scorer Vivianne Miedema for this tournament following the ACL injury she suffered with club side Arsenal in December.  Portugal are one of eight teams making their debut at the Women’s World Cup this year, alongside Haiti, the Republic of Ireland, Morocco, Panama, the Philippines, Vietnam and Zambia. They qualified for the tournament thanks to a 2-1 win over Cameroon in the Inter-Confederation play-offs. Carole Costa won the match with a penalty in the fourth minute of stoppage time.  They have only played at two previous women’s international tournaments; European Championships in 2017 and 2022, and they were knocked out in the group stage in both of those competitions.  The Netherlands and Portugal have faced each other eight times previously, with the Dutch running out as winners in seven of those meetings.   The last five games between these two nations in women’s football have seen the Netherlands end victorious, with the most recent of those victories coming in the European Championship finals last summer. The 3-2 win for the Dutch came in the second round of group stage matches at the tournament, with Damaris Egurrola and Stefanie van der Gragt putting the Netherlands 2-0 ahead, before Portugal came back through strikes from Carole Costa (penalty) and Diana Silva. Daniëlle van de Donk scored the winner just after the hour mark.  The Opta supercomputer makes the Netherlands favourites for this clash in Group E, with a 61.5% chance of victory. Portugal’s chance of a win may be less than one-in-five (18.7%), but they would be happy to take something off one of Europe’s best footballing nations in their opening game – the chance of them getting at least a point stands at 38.5%.  Netherlands: Daphne van Domselaar, Lynn Wilms, Stefanie van der Gragt, Aniek Nouwen, Merel van Dongen, Jill Roord, Lineth Beerensteyn, Sherida Spitse, Katja Snoeijs, Daniëlle van de Donk, Lieke Martens, Jill Baijings, Renate Jansen, Jackie Groenen, Caitlin Dijkstra, Lize Kop, Victoria Pelova, Kerstin Casparij, Wieke Kaptein, Dominique Janssen, Damaris Egurrola, Esmee Brugts, Jacintha Weimar.  Portugal: Inês Pereira, Catarina Amado, Lúcia Alves, Sílvia Rebelo, Joana Marchão, Andreia Jacinto, Ana Rute, Andreia Norton, Ana Borges, Jéssica Silva, Tatiana Pinto, Patrícia Morais, Fátima Pinto, Dolores Silva, Carole Costa, Diana Silva, Ana Seiça, Carolina Mendes, Diana Gomes, Francisca Nazareth, Ana Capeta, Rute Costa, Telma Encarnação.  Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

10832,England vs Haiti: 2023 Women’s World Cup Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to this 2023 Women’s World Cup Group D fixture at Lang Park, Brisbane with our England vs Haiti preview and prediction. The European champions are set to begin their quest to add the World Cup to their trophy cabinet, and start with a clash against tournament debutants, Haiti. Should Sarina Wiegman’s side manage to go all the way, they will become only the second team – after Germany in 2003 and 2007 – to win the Women’s World Cup as reigning European champions. This will be the first ever encounter between these two nations. The Lionesses have never lost a group stage game against a CONCACAF side at the Women’s World Cup (W2 D1), though did concede in all three of those games. This is England’s fifth Women’s World Cup in a row, and sixth overall. They will be hoping to keep up recent performances as one of only three teams – along with USA and Germany – to reach the quarter-finals in each of the last four tournaments, and one of two – with the USA – to reach the semi-finals in the last two. Only Steph Houghton (1,290) has played more minutes at the last two Women’s World Cups than England’s Lucy Bronze (1,180). The Barcelona right-back recorded 691 touches in the 2019 tournament, which was more than any other player, with 431 made under pressure from opponents, also the most of anyone. Haiti are one of eight teams making their World Cup debut at this year’s tournament and qualified by beating Senegal and then Chile in the Inter-Confederation play-offs. Daelle Dumornay – also known as ‘Corventina’ – will be one to watch after she scored both goals in the win over Chile. Nicolas Delépine’s side will try to become the first CONCACAF team to win a match in its first appearance at the Women’s World Cup since the USA won all six games in the first ever tournament in 1991. Since then, four CONCACAF teams have managed a combined record of just three draws and nine losses in their first World Cup appearances. As mentioned, these two have never played each other. England have won just one of their last eight games against CONCACAF nations in all competitions (D2 L5). Their only victory came in their last experience of facing such opposition (2-1 vs USA in October 2022). England are the clear favourites for this one as the reigning European champions and one of the favourites to go all the way in Australia and New Zealand. They may have a few star players missing through injury but the Opta supercomputer still believe they will easily overcome the debutants. England are handed a 93.7% chance of success on Saturday. Should they take the lead, they should be fine. England have never lost when scoring the first goal in a Women’s World Cup game (W13 D2) and have won their last nine games in the competition when scoring the opener. Haiti are not arriving in great form. They have played four games in the last month and lost them all. Three in the Central American and Caribbean Games against Guatemala (3-1), Venezuela (4-1) and Costa Rica (2-0), and also in a warm-up friendly against South Korea (2-1). That, coupled with their inexperience in the World Cup, probably explains why they are handed just an 2% chance of victory. A draw is given a 4.3% chance. England: Mary Earps, Lucy Bronze, Niamh Charles, Keira Walsh, Alex Greenwood, Millie Bright, Lauren James, Georgia Stanway, Rachel Daly, Ella Toone, Lauren Hemp, Jordan Nobbs, Hannah Hampton, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Esme Morgan, Jess Carter, Laura Coombs, Chloe Kelly, Bethany England, Katie Zelem, Ellie Roebuck, Katie Robinson, Alessia Russo.

10833,United States vs Vietnam: 2023 Women’s World Cup Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to this 2023 Women’s World Cup Group E fixture at Eden Park, Auckland with our United States vs Vietnam preview and prediction. Women’s World Cup debutants Vietnam couldn’t have picked a tougher first game even if they’d tried; a gruelling challenge awaits them at Eden Park in Auckland on Saturday as Group E gets started. The USWNT head into the tournament as overwhelming favourites and the defending champions after lifting the trophy four years ago and in 2015. Those successes contributed to a remarkable run that’s seen them win each of their past 12 Women’s World Cup games, a tournament record, amassing a goal difference of +32 over those fixtures. A big part of that huge goal difference was the 13-0 win over Thailand in their opening game four years ago. The USA are unbeaten in their previous 22 matches against teams from the AFC region, winning 16 of them and averaging 3.6 goals per game. They’ve also never lost a Women’s World Cup game to an Asian nation in 15 meetings. While Vietnam are ranked higher than nine other teams at the tournament, it would certainly be momentous if they pulled off an upset. Thailand were one of the teams Vietnam beat when winning the play-off tournament that secured their qualification for the World Cup. They gained entry to the play-offs thanks to reaching the quarter-finals of the 2022 AFC Women’s Asian Cup, as they contested the knockout stages for the first time. This is an entirely different proposition, however, and the USWNT are among the most battle-hardened at this level. That includes Megan Rapinoe, who’s been involved in 15 goals across his 17 matches at the Women’s World Cup and is set to retire this year having already secured herself a legacy as one of the greats of the game. She’ll be eager to get another medal in Australia and New Zealand, though, and it all starts here. These two sides have never faced each other before – that doesn’t just mean at the Women’s World Cup, we’re talking in any competitive game. As already mentioned, the USA boast a formidable record against Asian countries, though the only one they have faced in the past 12 months was Japan, taking a slender 1-0 victory from their encounter in February. Vietnam’s pre-tournament preparations included facing another of the World Cup favourites, Euro 2022 runners-up Germany, coming out of that with a respectable 2-1 defeat. But since then, they’ve lost 2-0 to World Cup co-hosts New Zealand and been thrashed 9-0 by Spain.  As you might have expected, the Opta supercomputer sees this being rather one-sided. In fact, you aren’t likely to see a prediction more heavily favouring one team than this at the 2023 Women’s World Cup. According to the model, the USA have an 95.3% probability of winning this match; Vietnam’s chance of victory is just 2%. Of course, that does mean the supercomputer thinks Vietnam have a 4.7% likelihood of getting at least a point, and they’d probably take those odds given the wider context of this game. Anything other than a comfortable USA victory would represent something of a shock. People might even be tempted to look up record wins at the Women’s World Cup ahead of this one. United States: Alyssa Naeher, Ashley Sanchez, Sofia Huerta, Naomi Girma, Kelley O’Hara, Lynn Williams, Alyssa Thompson, Julie Ertz, Savannah DeMelo, Lindsey Horan, Sophia Smith, Alana Cook, Alex Morgan, Emily Sonnett, Megan Rapinoe, Rose Lavelle, Andi Sullivan, Casey Murphy, Crystal Dunn, Trinity Rodman, Aubrey Kingsbury, Kristie Mewis, Emily Fox.  Vietnam: Đào Thị Kiều Oanh, Lương Thị Thu Thương, Chương Thị Kiều, Trần Thị Thu, Hoàng Thị Loan, Trần Thị Thúy Nga, Nguyễn Thị Tuyết Dung, Trần Thị Thùy Trang, Huỳnh Như, Trần Thị Hải Linh, Thái Thị Thảo, Phạm Hải Yến, Lê Thị Diễm My, Trần Thị Kim Thanh, Nguyễn Thị Thúy Hằng, Dương Thị Vân, Trần Thị Thu Thảo, Vũ Thị Hoa, Nguyễn Thị Thanh Nhã, Khổng Thị Hằng, Ngân Thị Vạn Sự, Nguyễn Thị Mỹ Anh, Nguyễn Thị Bích Thùy.

10835,Nigeria vs Canada: Women’s World Cup 2023 Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to the second match in Group B at the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium with our Nigeria vs Canada prediction and preview. Nigeria and Canada kick off their 2023 Women’s World Cup campaigns with a match that the North Americans will certainly feel they should be winning. Although Nigeria have plenty of World Cup pedigree, having played at every single edition of the tournament so far, Canada are reigning Olympic champions, and will be far more hopeful of going deep in the tournament. Many of the members of their squad who won gold in Tokyo in 2020 are still around, so they have plenty of experience in their ranks. Christine Sinclair has a whopping 323 caps to her name, while in Sophie Schmidt (221), Kadeisha Buchanan (131), Ashley Lawrence (117) and Jessie Fleming (115), Canada have four more players with over 100 international caps. Their English coach, Bev Priestman, spent two years as Phil Neville’s assistant with the Lionesses, and she knows what it takes to win a tournament, having been in charge in Tokyo and having also won the SheBelieves Cup with England in 2019. The reigning Olympic title holders have always managed to reach the knockout stage in the following Women’s World Cup, while the USA has twice managed to win the World Cup straight after Olympic success, doing so in 1999 and 2015, so there is good reason to expect good things from Canada. Nigeria, meanwhile, are the only African team to play at every single edition of the Women’s World Cup, but they hold the unwanted record of having the lowest goal difference in the history of the tournament (-43), winning just four of their 26 matches. Since the turn of the century, they have failed to score in 12 of their 16 matches at the Women’s World Cup and have won only two of those games. However, perhaps crucially, one of those wins was a 1–0 over Canada back in 2011, while the other was at the most recent tournament – a 2-0 win over South Korea in 2019. You can see why Canada are favourites to win, but Nigeria do have plenty of quality in their squad, with lots of players who play their club football in Europe or the USA. Barcelona’s Asisat Oshoala will be their key player at the tournament, having scored 30 goals in 41 international appearances so far. With a goal at this tournament, she would become the first African to score at three different Women’s World Cup tournaments. Nigeria and Canada have met five times before, and two of those meetings have come in Women’s World Cups. Nigeria are unbeaten in those two World Cup meetings, but they came rather a long time ago – a 3-3 draw in 1995 and the aforementioned 1-0 win for Nigeria in 2011. Canada have beaten Nigeria twice in friendlies in recent years, before the sides played out a 2-2 draw in their most recent meeting in April 2022. That day, Nigeria twice took the lead, but were pegged back both times. Canada only just managed to rescue a draw in 88th minute. Both teams have a little too much experience of losing World Cup matches, with Nigeria having lost more games at WWCs than any other side (19), and Canada following close behind them having lost the third most (14). The Opta supercomputer reckons it is more likely that Nigeria will make it 20 defeats by losing this one, as Canada have a 58.4% chance of picking up all three points to start Group B in the best way possible. However, Nigeria have won their last three games in the lead up to this World Cup and will hope they can extend that run of form into the tournament itself. The Opta supercomputer gives a 17.8% chance of that happening. Nigeria: Tochukwu Oluehi, Ashleigh Plumptre, Osinachi Ohale, Glory Ogbonna, Onome Ebi, Ifeoma Onumonu, Toni Payne, Asisat Oshoala, Desire Oparanozie, Christy Ucheibe, Gift Monday, Uchenna Kanu, Deborah Abiodun, Oluwatosin Demehin, Rasheedat Ajibade, Chiamaka Nnadozie, Francisca Ordega, Halimatu Ayinde, Jennifer Echegini, Rofiat Imuran, Esther Okoronkwo, Michelle Alozie, Yewande Balogun.  Canada: Kailen Sheridan, Allysha Chapman, Kadeisha Buchanan, Shelina Zadorsky, Quinn, Deanne Rose, Julia Grosso, Jayde Riviere, Jordyn Huitema, Ashley Lawrence, Evelyne Viens, Christine Sinclair, Sophie Schmidt, Vanessa Gilles, Nichelle Prince, Gabrielle Carle, Jessie Fleming, Sabrina D’Angelo, Adriana Leon, Cloé Lacasse, Simi Awujo, Lysianne Proulx, Olivia Smith.   Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

10837,New Zealand vs Norway: 2023 Women’s World Cup Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to the opening game of the 2023 Women’s World Cup at Eden Park, Auckland with our New Zealand vs Norway preview and prediction. Co-hosts New Zealand may enter as rank outsiders to win the 2023 Women’s World Cup, but they’ll be very hopeful of ending a woeful record in the competition at the very least. They have played more matches without winning a single game at the Women’s World Cup than any other nation in the competition’s history (15 games, zero wins). They are also the only side to have ever made five appearances in the tournament without reaching the knockout stages. The opening game of the 2023 finals is an opportunity to turn over a new leaf. Something will have to give, however. New Zealand must end their dreadful run of losing the opening match at all five of their tournament participations (1991, 2007, 2011, 2015, 2019), while they face a Norway side who have won on matchday one in each of their last seven World Cups. Norway have good pedigree at this level but aren’t expected to pick up their second Women’s World Cup title in 2023, with the Opta supercomputer ranking them as only the 12th most likely to go all the way. Despite that, they stand a good chance of winning Group A ahead of the co-hosts, Switzerland and Philippines, so will be optimistic of a strong start. New Zealand and Norway have met once at the FIFA Women’s World Cup before this match. This meeting was during the second matchday of the first edition of the tournament in 1991, with a win 4-0 for the Norwegians. The current head coach of Norway, Hege Riise, scored the first of her nine Women’s World Cup goals as a player during that game. The last meeting between Norway and New Zealand came just over a year ago, in June 2022. Norway enjoyed a 2-0 victory over Jitka Klimková’s side thanks to goals from Ada Hegerberg and Guro Bergsvand. The Opta supercomputer is predicting more Women’s World Cup woe for New Zealand ahead of kick-off in this match, with Norway the favourites for the victory at 52.4%. This would mean New Zealand’s winless run at the Women’s World Cup would stretch to 16 matches. The co-hosts have a 21.8% chance of winning at the WWC for the first time, and doing so in front of their own fans. The draw – while not a terrible result for either side – is being given a 25.8% chance of occurring. New Zealand: Erin Nayler, Ria Percival, Claudia Bunge, CJ Bott, Michaela Foster, Malia Steinmetz, Ali Riley, Daisy Cleverley, Gabi Rennie, Annalie Longo, Olivia Chance, Betsy Hassett, Rebekah Stott, Katie Bowen, Paige Satchell, Jacqui Hand, Hannah Wilkinson, Grace Jale, Elizabeth Anton, Indiah-Paige Riley, Victoria Esson, Milly Clegg, Anna Leat. Norway: Cecilie Fiskerstrand, Anja Sønstevold, Sara Hørte, Tuva Hansen, Guro Bergsvand, Maren Mjelde, Ingrid Syrstad Engen, Vilde Bøe Risa, Karina Sævik, Caroline Graham Hansen, Guro Reiten, Guro Pettersen, Thea Bjelde, Ada Hegerberg, Amalie Eikeland, Mathilde Harviken, Julie Blakstad, Frida Maanum, Marit Bratberg Lund, Emilie Haavi, Anna Jøsendal, Sophie Román Haug, Aurora Mikalsen.

10838,Australia vs Republic of Ireland: 2023 Women’s World Cup Preview and Prediction,"We look ahead to this 2023 Women’s World Cup Group B fixture at Stadium Australia, Sydney with our Australia vs Republic of Ireland preview and prediction. Australia will be hoping to get off to a positive start at the 2023 Women’s World Cup as co-hosts, and they’ve arguably been given the kindest match of their Group B campaign with an opener against the Republic of Ireland. With matches against Canada and Nigeria to follow in the group stage, the Matildas will be hoping to pick up all three points in this match. Starting well at a Women’s World Cup has been an issue for Australia in recent tournaments – they have lost the opening game in each of the last three WWCs, losing to Brazil in 2011, USA in 2015 and Italy in 2019. The only occasion that they have won their opening match of a Women’s World Cup tournament in seven attempts was back in 2007, defeating Ghana 4-1. The Republic of Ireland certainly won’t be pushovers, though. As one of eight nations making their Women’s World Cup debut in this tournament, they come into the 2023 edition having conceded just four goals in their nine qualifiers and never more than once in a single game. That tight defence will need to stay on the ball in this game, with one of the best strikers in the women’s game lining up for Australia in Sam Kerr. Kerr not only made our list of players to watch at the 2023 World Cup, but she also featured in our five potential winners of the Golden Boot award at the tournament. She’s scored five goals in her last four appearances at the Women’s World Cup, including a four-goal haul in a win over Jamaica in 2019. This will be just the second encounter between Australia and the Republic of Ireland, with the Irish running out 3-2 winners in a September 2021 friendly match. In what was Sam Kerr’s 100th appearance for Australia, the Matildas were missing a host of first-choice players. Mary Fowler scored a brace, but Australia struggled to cope with the Irish counter-attack and goals from Denise O’Sullivan and Louise Quinn after a third-minute own goal from goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold saw the Republic run out as winners. Australia will hope to improve on their poor Women’s World Cup record against European nations in this match. They’ve previously won just one of their nine meetings with teams from Europe in the competition (D3 L5), with that coming against Norway in 2011 (2-1). Co-hosts Australia are expected to get off to a good start at the 2023 Women’s World Cup with victory in their opening game against the Republic of Ireland and the Opta supercomputer thinks this is the most likely result. They are being given a 53.7% chance of winning on matchday one and starting their Group B campaign with three points. The Irish are undoubtedly the underdogs here and have just over a one-in-five chance of winning (21%), with the draw being given a 25.3% chance. Don’t bet on a 0-0 draw, though. None of Australia’s 26 matches at the FIFA Women’s World Cup have ended goalless. Only Nigeria have played as many matches in the tournament without registering a 0-0. Australia: Lydia Williams, Courtney Nevin, Aivi Luik, Clare Polkinghorne, Cortnee Vine, Clare Wheeler, Steph Catley, Alex Chidiac, Caitlin Foord, Emily van Egmond, Mary Fowler, Teagan Micah, Tameka Yallop, Alanna Kennedy, Clare Hunt, Hayley Raso, Kyah Simon, Mackenzie Arnold, Katrina Gorry, Sam Kerr, Ellie Carpenter, Charlotte Grant, Kyra Cooney-Cross.

Here, you’ll find all of our experts’ group previews in one place. The 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup is nearly here, with the action getting started on 20 July when co-hosts New Zealand go up against Norway at Eden Park in Auckland.

It will also be the first Women’s World Cup co-hosted by two nations; Australia get their campaign started on 20 July as well against the Republic of Ireland, one of eight countries debuting at this year’s tournament. The United States will be the favourites, though. Not only are the USWNT defending champions, they are top of the FIFA World Rankings heading into the tournament and find themselves in a group most will expect them to cruise through to the knockout stages. The Netherlands, runners-up in 2019, hope to push them all the way in the first round but are without star striker Viviane Miedema, the Arsenal forward missing out due to injury. England reached the semi-finals four years ago, losing out to the USA. Since then they’ve gone to another level having won the UEFA European Women’s Football Championship, which was secured with a 2-1 win over Germany after extra time last year.

10841,2023 Women’s World Cup: 10 Players to Watch,"Australia and New Zealand are ready to co-host the ninth edition of the FIFA Women’s World Cup starting on 20 July – the first to feature an expanded pool of 32 teams, mirroring the men’s tournament. Over 700 players have been named in the squads for the teams at the finals, but some will take centre stage more than others. This will be the last dance for legends like Marta and Megan Rapinoe, while there are young talents itching to join the next list of superstars. Here, we pick out 10 of the players we’re expecting to stand out this summer at the tournament. One of the best forwards in the women’s game, Sam Kerr will lead Australia on home soil at the World Cup. The country’s all-time top scorer – men’s or women’s – will shoulder the burden of carrying her side to their maiden World Cup. Not only is she still the all-time top scorer in the United States’ NWSL (77 regular season goals) and one of only two players to have won the Australian A-League Women Golden Boot award more than once (2018 and 2019), but she’s also scored more goals in the English WSL than any other player since her debut in January 2020 (54 – with none of those from penalties). Despite a drop off in her goalscoring output this season, with just 12 league goals in 21 appearances after successive 20+ goal campaigns, she’s still a player who consistently finds great positions to score. Among players with at least eight non-penalty goals last season in the WSL, only Leah Galton (94.6%) attempted a higher proportion of their non-penalty shots from inside the box than Kerr (91.1%), while Khadija Shaw (0.79) was the only player with a higher non-penalty xG per 90 than hers (0.63). She is extremely dangerous in the final third, maximizing every touch of the ball. 26.1% of her total touches come inside the opposition penalty box, which is the highest figure among all WSL players with eight or more goals. Sam Kerr ended the press conference in the best way possible 😤“Whatever it takes to win.”Mic drop 🎤#FIFAWWC #OptusSport pic.twitter.com/6YtFLgeUjO She’s added an air of selflessness to her game in the past season and her recent comments about serving as a decoy for other players to thrive in attacking areas is a testament to this development. Being physically robust makes her an excellent direct outlet for her side with her positioning and hold-up play – only Lauren Hemp (107) received more open-play long balls than Kerr (93) in the WSL this season. Her aerial prowess and ability to win first contact on these long balls make her a viable option and a threat on set-pieces and crosses. Her aerial win rate has consistently lingered around the 60% mark and her 47 aerials won is only behind Khadija Shaw (61) and Dagný Brynjarsdóttir (51) in the WSL.  She has impeccable control on her first contact, often laying it off for the wide runners in behind. This tactic might come in handy for the Matildas this summer, with the side blessed with pace all around Kerr. With USWNT star Megan Rapinoe retiring at the end of this year, 34-year-old Alex Morgan coming to the end of her brilliant career and Crystal Dunn and Julie Ertz now both 31 years old, there’s bound to be a changing of the guard in US women’s soccer upon the horizon. Step forward Sophia Smith. The 22-year-old is ready to shine at her first World Cup after taking the NWSL by storm. Voted the competition MVP in 2022 following 15 goals and three assists (including play-offs), she’s began the 2023 campaign in even more impressive fashion. With 10 goals and five assists across just 13 appearances, Smith is only three goal involvements off last season’s tally with seven regular season matchdays left to play. The former Stanford University star is blessed with pace and explosiveness on the ball, making her dangerous with the ball at her feet. Of players to play at least 500 minutes of NWSL action this season, Smith averages the most take-ons per 90 (7.9), with her 44% success rate above average across the 30 most prolific players from take-ons across the league. Fourteen of her take-ons have ended with a shot as the next action – nearly double that of any other player in the league. She also leads the NWSL this season for progressive carries per 90 among all non-defenders (9.8), while attempting a league-high 43 shots following ball carries – 20 more than any other player in the competition. Overall, her 52 shot-ending carries (43 shots, nine chances created) are another NWSL-high. Her ability to attack the space between the centre-backs and in the channel between the central defenders and full-backs add further value to her stock as a goalscorer. She takes up wide starting positions and very often beats her marker for pace, making her an excellent progressive outlet for her side. Her 123 progressive passes received is only behind Morgan Weaver (141) and Trinity Rodman (130) in the NWSL. As USWNT aim for their fifth Women’s World Cup title, Smith will be tasked with sharing the side’s offensive load. Germany enter every major international tournament as one of the favourites and this World Cup is no different. The USA are the only team other than the Germans to have won the Women’s World Cup more than once, and both are expected to be in the running for another title this summer. There are many famous German goalscorers in World Cup past, with Birgit Prinz (14 goals) and Bettina Weigmann (11) among the highest scoring players in Women’s World Cup history. Alexandra Popp has scored at the last two World Cups for Germany (two in 2019, one in 2015), but with seven goals needed this time around to reach double figures, it’s unlikely that she’ll end up threatening her Prinz and Weigmann in the charts any time soon. She is among the all-time leading scorers in German international history, though, scoring 62 times and ranking fifth among all women. She should move up those rankings this summer, too, with just one goal separating her and fourth-ranked Célia Sasic (63) and two away from third-placed Inka Grings (64). After sharing the Euro 2022 Golden Boot with Beth Mead last summer thanks to her six goals, the two-time German footballer of the year finished the 2022-23 domestic season with 16 Bundesliga goals to top the scoring charts in the league. None of those goals came from penalties, either. Of the 12 players across the top five European women’s leagues in 2022-23 to score at least 14 non-penalty goals, Popp had the second highest shot conversion rate of 27.6%, behind only Tabitha Chawinga (33.8%). One reason for her lethal numbers in the German league last season was her exceptional aerial prowess. The 5-foot-9 striker is a menace with her physically imposing nature and intensity. The Wolfsburg forward can rattle defences with her movements and ability to physically engage opposition defenders. She scored the most headed goals across the top five European leagues in 2022-23 (nine), with those headers contributing over half of her total goal tally in the Bundesliga (56.3%). Popp has a knack of stepping up in clutch situations, scoring goals in important matches. Examples can be found in the UEFA Women’s Champions League semi-final second leg against Arsenal, as well as scoring in the eventual final defeat to Barcelona, plus the European Championship semi-final versus France last summer, where she scored both of Germany’s goals in the 2-1 win. The 2022 European Championships were the crowning moment for England midfielder Keira Walsh. With a host of top-class performances at the tournament on the way to eventual glory, her stock couldn’t have risen much higher. As a result she was picked up by Barcelona for an at-the-time record transfer fee. Her first season in Spain didn’t go too badly, either. Barcelona won the UEFA Champions League and league double. The 26-year-old midfielder is the lynchpin for her side, connecting the defence and attack with her passing and her positioning in the early phases of buildup. She is safe and progressive on the ball while offering security without it with her positional discipline. Across England’s successful Euros campaign, no Lioness started more open-play sequences leading to shots (nine), while she was one of only three England players involved in more than 30 open-play passing sequences that ended in a shot (31). A voluminous passer by nature, Walsh’s execution is what sets her apart. She averaged 72.7 passes per 90 with a pass completion rate of 89.9%, which is the highest among all players in the Spanish top flight. When in possession she is consistently looking to progress the ball into the opposition third of the pitch. Walsh’s average of eight final third passes per 90 was the sixth highest in the Spanish league last season. She has a variety of passes in her repertoire, from lateral passes to disguised line breakers, geared towards both retention and progression. Of course, who could forget her phenomenal pass to assist Ella Toone’s opening goal in the Euro 2022 final against Germany? If England are to have more success this summer, Walsh will be key.  Spain will be without key players at this World Cup, with some ruling themselves out of selection ahead of the tournament owing to disagreements with the Spanish federation. Despite those absentees, it’s hard to rule out Spain as potential winners with the host of talent still in their ranks. That includes the returning two-time Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas. With Putellas out with an ACL injury across last summer at Euro 2022 and large chunks of the 2022-23 domestic season for Barcelona, her teammates needed to step up. One player who grabbed the reigns in midfield for both Spain and Barcelona was Aitana Bonmatí. The Spaniard scored nine goals and provided 10 assists in the league in 2022-23, finishing the season with 19 direct goal contributions – only six players were involved in more non-penalty goals than her in the competition. She also played an integral part in their UWCL success, with more assists than any other player in the competition last season (eight) and chipping in with five goals. Across the Spanish top-flight and UWCL last season, no Barcelona player to play at least 1,800 minutes of action averaged more open-play shot-ending sequence involvements per 90 than Bonmatí (9.3). Bonmatí is a key factor to make Barcelona and Spain’s front foot defensive tactic work. She doesn’t shy away from the unglamorous responsibilities off-the-ball, closing out passing angles and hounding the opponent on the ball, making her an elite presser. Her 115 ball recoveries in the league were the fifth most at Barcelona, while only Mariona Caldentey (2.1) won possession in the final third of the pitch more frequently on a per-90 basis than she did (1.6). In the absence of midfield partner, Guijarro, Bonmatí will once again have to morph herself to compensate for her side’s needs on and off the ball. If Spain are to make a deep run on their third attempt, the diminutive midfielder will have to cast a large shadow on the field. Zambia are one the debutants at this World Cup and are the lowest ranked nation at the tournament, placed 77th in the latest edition of the FIFA Rankings. The African nation grabbed headlines when they beat Germany 3-2 in a pre-World Cup friendly game just two weeks before the tournament kicks off, handing out warning signs that they are not here to just make up numbers. The performance was a testament to the quality in their forward line led by the flamboyant young duo of Racheal Kundananji and Barbra Banda. Kundananji comes into these finals off the back of a superb domestic campaign. She ended 2022-23 with 25 league goals in Spain, just two goals behind the competition’s top scorer Alba Redondo (27), but with the same tally of non-penalty strikes as her (25). That tally of 25 was the highest across the top five women’s leagues in Europe, while only Redondo (19) scored in a higher number of league matches than the Zambian (17) across those five competitions. Kundananji was involved in 155 of 500 non-penalty shots in league competition for Madrid CFF last season (112 shots, 43 chances created) – nearly a third (31%) of their total. Only Redondo (174) and Caroline Weir (165) were involved in more across the Spanish league. Across the top five European women’s leagues in 2022-23, she one of only 10 players to play at least 1,000 minutes and average over 4.5 non-penalty shots per 90 (4.6). The quick forward is a menacing presence who seeks contact before putting on the afterburners. She is deadly in transition situations with the ball at her feet, eating up ground with ease. No player had more shot-ending (55) or chance-creating carries (20) in the Liga F than the 23-year-old forward. Sixteen of her 25 goals were preceded by a ball carry, underlining her ability to run with the ball while being extremely effective with it. Only Mayra Ramirez (12) attempted more shots following a take-on than her (11), while Kundananji was also the most effective player at beating her marker and getting into the box, doing it 14 times in the Liga F. Only Mayra Ramirez (25) recorded more take-ons inside the opposition box than she did (24). If Zambia are to surprise at this tournament, Kundananji will undoubtedly be central any shocks. Norway have been an ever-present fixture at the World Cup, and are one of only three European nations to appear in every edition of the tournament since it began in 1991. The 1995 champions finished in the top four across each of the first five editions but have failed to get past the quarter-final stages since. The talented Scandinavian side will be hoping to remedy that and return to the glory days of the past with Hege Riise – a former World Cup winner with Norway – at the helm. Spearheading this charge will be Chelsea’s baby-faced assassin Guro Reiten. Reiten finished as the Women’s Super League top assister last season with 11, just four short of the competition record and the most since Fran Kirby’s 12 in 2020-21. Arguably Chelsea’s Player of the Season, she also posted an expected assists total of 6.2, which was the third best in the competition and displayed how dangerous her passes were. She featured among the top five WSL players for open-play chances created (37) and passes played into the opposition box (140). She was often crucial to Chelsea’s build-up to shots, even when not the creator or the player to attempt the shot. Reiten tallied 21 secondary chances created in 2022-23 – the pass before the chance created for a shot – which was the fourth-highest tally in the competition. The Norwegian also weighed in with goals, as Chelsea’s second highest scorer in league competition last season (nine) behind Sam Kerr (12), while her non-penalty xG total of 3.7 was the second highest in the squad. Norway had an underwhelming European Championships last summer, but if Reiten can bring her club form in 2022-23 to these finals, Norway could pose a threat to any opponent. France were a side in turmoil for issues that extended beyond the pitch. While tides have turned in that regard following a managerial change, they have been cursed with injuries and are missing key players in every department. Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Delphine Cascarino are missing in attack, Amandine Henry has been ruled out with an injury and the defence is still without Griedge Mbock. Despite their absentees, France’s squad is still loaded with talent. One such rising star is Olympique Lyon’s Selma Bacha. Bacha has established herself as one of the mainstays at Lyon after breaking into the first team at just 16 years old. The youngster can play in any role on the left flank and is blessed with a wand of a left foot and a desire to get forward and support attack. Despite playing just 1,046 minutes of league action in 2022-23, only two players across the top five European women’s leagues assisted more goals from set plays than she did (six), while only seven players created more chances from these situations than her (26). Her average of 0.45 expected assists per 90 were the highest of any player to play at least 1,000 minutes in the French top flight in 2022-23, while only two players across the major European leagues could better that average – Mariona Caldentey (0.53 per 90) and Chloe Kelly (0.55). Only Faustine Robert (5.4 per 90) average more successful open-play crosses per 90 than her (4.1) in the French league last season, while she was one of just 15 players across the top five leagues in Europe to play over 1,000 minutes and average at least four successful open-play crosses per 90 minutes. Having a player so dangerous from crossing and set pieces will be something France can weaponise at this tournament, especially with the known aerial ability of Wendie Renard. If Bacha hits the ground running in this tournament, France could be a force to be reckoned with. Brazil will play their first Women’s World Cup tournament without the legendary Formiga, while the 2023 edition also looks like it could be the last for another national team legend – Marta. The all-time top goalscorer at the World Cup – men’s or women’s – will need to pass on the goalscoring baton for Brazil. One player that could take up the mantle is Geyse. The 25-year-old Barcelona forward is a key part of Pia Sundhage’s side and will be a player to watch in these finals. After ending 2021-22 as joint top scorer in Spanish Primera with 20 goals alongside Asisat Oshoala, she departed Madrid CFF and joined Oshoala at Barcelona to form an enviable attacking force. Whilst she won the league and UWCL double, she couldn’t replicate her scoring return in league action across 2022-23, with just six goals in 24 appearances for Barca, but she certainly made an impact in the UEFA Champions League. Her nine non-penalty goal involvements (four goals, five assists) were the third most in the competition behind only teammate Aitana Bonmatí (12) and Wolfsburg forward Ewa Pajor (10). Fans can expect Geyse to be entertaining to watch this summer when progressing the ball upfield. She averaged the sixth most dribbles per 90 (5.1) across the Spanish league last season of players to play at least 1,000 minutes and was ranked in the same position for carries into the penalty area per 90 (2.4).  In addition, only five forwards and attacking midfielders averaged a higher progressive carry distance per 90 than the Brazilian (91.5m) last season, With her positioning, high and wide, she can offer an excellent out-ball option for her sides, helping them add verticality. Her 155 progressive passes received was the fifth most in the Barcelona squad last season. One downside is that she can be slightly overzealous without the ball, often initiating unwanted contact and giving away fouls. This can reflect itself in her card tally. No Barcelona player committed more fouls (28) or received more yellow cards (five) than the Brazilian in league action last season. Japan has been quietly producing talented generations of youngsters over the last decade, the fruits of which are shining across the globe. Little Nadeshiko (their U17 side) won the 2014 World Cup while finishing as runners-up in 2016, while the Young Nadeshiko (U20 side) have not finished outside the top three since 2016, and won the U20 World Cup in 2018. Yui Hasegawa is the fruit of their 2014 U17 side. The nimble-footed magician has since played in Europe and established herself as one of the most technically skilled midfielders around. The Man City midfielder showed her proficiency in playing a deeper role in the midfield this season. The attacking midfielder shone from a deeper starting position, bringing her defensive awareness to the forefront. Her positional discipline and reading of the game to pick up loose balls in the final two thirds of the pitch received their due credit. No player initiated more open-play sequences than the midfielder in the English top flight last term (302), highlighting her ability to recover possession and kick-start attacks. The only player to win possession from opponents more often than her (159) in the 2022-23 WSL was Katie Zelem (170). Her supportive play through the thirds continues to be a big part of her game. She is consistently showing up for the ball in between lines and working in tandem with the moving parts around her. No player was involved in more open play sequences ending with a shot as part of the build-up only (75) than her in the WSL, underlining her core skillset in the offensive phase of play. Japan are a side that like to maintain possession and trap their opponents high up the field, which makes front-foot defensive-minded players all the more desirable. Hasegawa is one of these players, with her total of 29 open-play sequence starts being the joint-highest in WSL last season alongside Arsenal’s Frida Maanum. In addition, only five players actively won possession back from opponents to start open-play passing sequences than the Japan international (nine) in the WSL across 2022-23. With Japan hoping to recreate their 2011 triumph, their young generation will have to produce the goods again. The U17 WWC silver ball-winning midfielder will take centre stage for the Japanese either way. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

10842,Who Will Win the 2023 Women’s World Cup Golden Boot?,"With the 2023 Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand fast approaching, we look at who could emerge as the tournament’s sharpshooter as we delve into the details of five potential contenders. We’ve selected five players who all stake their claim in different ways. Whether it’s history and experience or coming into the competition as a relative novice but with a great domestic season behind them. First up is the hosts’ record goalscorer and one of the very best in the game, Chelsea and Australia’s Sam Kerr. With the backing of a home crowd and the Aussie record of 63 international goals behind her, we see Kerr as one of the more obvious choices to deliver when it really matters for her team. Indeed, she has scored more goals than any other player in the English Women’s Super League (WSL) since her debut in January 2020, with 54 in 67 games, 16 more than Vivianne Miedema, who hit 38 in 57 games in the same period. It’s not surprising for a striker, but the 29-year-old is most dangerous inside the opposition penalty area. Kerr doesn’t tend to get too involved in the play up until that point and that’s shown by the fact she had the highest proportion of touches in the opposition box (26.1%) of all the players to have scored eight or more goals in the WSL during the 2022-23 season. Stina Blackstenius of Arsenal was the only player to have had fewer touches per 90 minutes with 33.9 compared to Kerr’s 36.1, showing that she is happy to wait for her opportunity in the latter stages of build-up play. Not only does she score poachers’ goals with her feet, but she also finishes superbly well with her head. Considering her relatively modest height of 5-foot-6, the fact she has scored 35.8% of goals via headers suggests she has brilliant movement, a great leap and, probably most importantly, excellent timing in the air. She didn’t have her most prolific season for Chelsea in 2022-23 but still managed to score 12 league goals as her side secured another WSL title and the FA Cup, with Kerr scoring the only goal of the game against Manchester United in the final at Wembley. All her goals last season came from inside the box, which is unsurprising when you consider she only had seven attempts from outside the area across the whole campaign. Not only was it her lowest scoring full season at Chelsea, but it was also her least productive in terms of shot conversion, with 15.2% of her shots leading to goals. That is likely down to the fact that her shots were of a lower quality (xG per shot 0.14) and the quality of the chances presented to her were also lower than in any previous league campaign at Chelsea (xG per 90 of 0.63). In terms of previous editions of the World Cup, it hasn’t been plain sailing for one of the world’s best. Now, of course, a lot of that could be down to the team she was playing in. The Matildas have become much more competitive on the world stage in recent years, including at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics when they narrowly lost the semi-final 1-0 to Sweden and eventually picked up fourth place – their best finish in four Olympic appearances. She heads into the World Cup in good form for her country, having registered the crucial first goal in April’s 2-0 friendly win over England at Brentford’s Community Stadium. Kerr failed to find the net in her first two World Cups, having had 13 unsuccessful shots across the two tournaments in 2011 and 2015, but in 2019 in France she found the net five times in four games, finishing just one goal behind Ellen White, Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan (six goals each). It would be fitting if Kerr won the Golden Boot this year in her home nation. Winning the World Cup Golden Boot in the same year as winning the award in the WSL would be no mean feat, but it’s something Rachel Daly could accomplish this summer. This choice won’t shock too many following her 22 goals in the 2022-23 WSL season – a tally that equalled Miedema’s competition record within a single campaign. With only three of those league goals coming from the penalty spot, her non-penalty stats are impressive. Those 19 goals seeing her sit in fifth place among non-penalty scorers within the top five European women’s leagues last season, while she also had a total of 28 direct goal involvements – again, the highest in the English top flight. Her tally of 13 England goals aren’t a fair reflection on her ability as a striker, having made many of her international appearances so far in various other positions. At last year’s UEFA European Championship, for example, Daly was ever-present as a left-back across England’s successful summer. She’s only been consistently utilised as a number 9 for England in the last 11 months, stepping into the shoes of the retired Ellen White and now fights it out with with Arsenal’s new signing Alessia Russo for the starting berth up top for the Lionesses. England’s warm-up game at home to Portugal saw Daly play the opening 45 minutes and Russo the second. Whichever way around England boss Sarina Weigman decides to play it, there are certainly goals available in this tournament for Daly, it’s just a case of whether she can take the opportunities presented to her. We saw the impact that England substitutes could have on games in their Euro 2022 success – seven of their 22 goals came from subs (32%) – so even if Daly does have to make do with second-half appearances, her pace and nous in and around the box can certainly yield goals. Added pressure will be on Daly (and Russo) to provide goals, with Euro 2022 top scorer Beth Mead ruled out of the World Cup through injury. Like Kerr, the 31-year-old is at her best inside the penalty area. Just six of her 22 goals saw her involved in the build-up before putting the ball into the net, while just one came from outside the box. Off the ball, Daly is exceptional and her ‘double’ movements cause defenders many problems, which often leaves her plenty of time and space to finish. Her 23.5% non-penalty shot conversion rate is very impressive, with only Inter Milan’s Tabitha Chawinga (35.8%) and Alexandra Popp of Wolfsburg (27.6%) yielding a better return among the 12 players with 14+ non-penalty goals across Europe’s top five leagues. In terms of her non-penalty xG in the WSL, only Khadija Shaw of Manchester City (16.66) and Kerr (10.87) posted a higher value than Daly’s 10.4. Since moving permanently to the centre forward position for England in the autumn of 2022, she has scored five goals, including the two headers in the 2-1 win over Italy at the Arnold Clark Cup in February. Her record in the air is decent too, having scored four headers for Villa last season, but can she head up the scoring charts? Another ‘safe’ pick for the Women’s World Cup Golden Boot, if there is such a thing, is Germany and Wolfsburg’s Alexandra Popp. Her credentials as a footballer were realised early on in her life as she attended Gesamtschule Berger Feld, a school in Gelsenkirchen which is one of only four facilities certified as an Elite School of Football by the German Football Association. She was the only female pupil and needed a special permit to attend. Many fans – perhaps mostly German or neutral – would suggest that had Popp not suffered an injury in the warm-up of the Euro 2022 final last summer, Germany would have had a much better chance of overcoming England and taking home the trophy for a ninth time. That injury was cruel on Popp, as she’d already scored six goals in the tournament and her absence in the final meant she was pipped to the Golden Boot by England’s Beth Mead after the Lioness tallied more assists (four) than she did (zero) and therefore won the title, as well as the UEFA Player of the Tournament award. Popp’s 16 goals for Wolfsburg in the Frauen Bundesliga saw her win the domestic top scorer title last season – her biggest threat coming aerially. She scored nine headed goals in league action, which was more than any other player in the top five European leagues in 2022-23, accounting for a huge 56.3% of her goal tally. Popp is another who is most at home inside the penalty area with only seven from her 58 shots in league action across 2022-23 coming from outside the area, with only one of those resulting in a goal. Last summer’s European Championship was by far Popp’s most prolific in terms of goals at major tournaments. The 2022 edition was 32-year-old Popp’s first Euros finals as she missed the 2013 and 2017 tournaments through injury. She has featured in three World Cups though, scoring just three goals. Having failed to score in the 2011 finals, her first World Cup goal arrived in Canada in 2015 as Germany finished in fourth place. She then scored twice at the 2019 finals in France as her team were knocked out at the quarter-final stage. Popp’s international record in general is not to be sniffed at. She has scored a more than respectable 62 goals in 128 international games – a total that sees her sit in fifth place in Germany’s all-time top goal scorers list, but just two more strikes this summer would see her jump to joint third alongside Inka Grings. The oldest of our five candidates is perhaps one of the less predictable selections. Thirty-four-year-old Le Sommer found herself in the international wilderness for two years having fallen out with previous French national team manager Corinne Diacre. When Diacre was replaced by Herve Renard, Le Sommer was reinstated and has repaid her new coach with three goals in three appearances – her 87th, 88th and 89th goals for her country, which see her sit eight goals clear at the top of the all-time French women goal table. Le Sommer hasn’t had a huge amount of game time in the run up to the World Cup, which perhaps leads to her being more of a wildcard pick. However, she’s excellent at finding great goalscoring opportunities with her positioning. With a non-penalty xG per 90 of 0.85 for Lyon, she ranked third across Europe’s top five leagues in 2022-23 of players to play at least 1,000 minutes of action. Of those players, she was ranked second for average non-penalty shot quality (0.23 xG per shot), behind only Barcelona and Nigeria star Asisat Oshoala (0.24). She is another who is at her most lethal when she plays within the confines of the penalty area as her seven league goals last season all came inside the box, while only nine of her 41 shots in the league came from further than 18 yards out. Le Sommer’s major tournament record stands at eight goals in 28 games. Her best return was at the 2015 World Cup in Canada where she scored three goals from 14 shots – including one against England in the opening game, a 1-0 victory for France. She was not selected for last year’s Euros though. Le Sommer knows what it takes to win, and that experience could be key this summer for France. She’s already picked up a staggering eight UEFA Women’s Champions League winners medals, alongside 10 league titles in France. Dismiss Le Sommer’s credentials as a potential Golden Boot winner this summer at your peril. If Le Sommer is considered a potential wildcard pick, then the United States’ Sophia Smith is the definite wildcard of these five candidates. She has a fight on her hands to even get on the pitch with the USA’s co-captain Alex Morgan amongst a talented crop of forwards Smith will compete with out in Australia and New Zealand. Her form for Portland Thorns in the NWSL, however, points to her coming into her first World Cup in great shape and she offers a different threat to our previous selections. Half of her 10 league goals have come from a distance beyond the 18-yard box. With those 10 strikes, Smith is atop of the goalscoring table and second in the assists chart with five to her name. In fact, Smith is also top of the charts with 72 shots attempted and 38 shots on target. After earning her first international call-up at the age of 16 in 2017, she had to wait until 2020 to make her full debut. The World Cup in Australia and New Zealand will be her first and so we’re entering a bit of the unknown. She was the first player born after their 1999 FIFA Women’s World Cup win to earn a senior cap for the USWNT. The 22-year-old did score twice against Jamaica in the 2022 CONCACAF Championships on the way to the USA winning the title for the ninth time, so she has some experience of senior international tournament football. She also represented her country in the 2018 U20 World Cup, where she scored three goals and registered one assist across 253 minutes at the tournament in France, despite the team failing to progress beyond the group stage. Smith isn’t all about goals, though, and her crucial involvement in the build-up to shots sees her sit at the top of the charts when compared to her NWSL colleagues. With an impressive 104 involvements in shot-ending sequences in just 1,060 minutes, she is clear of some more established players such as Crystal Dunn and Lynn Williams. Of those 108 involvements, 72 were shots of her own, she created 18 chances for others and was involved in the build-up to a shot a further 18 times. Despite her relative lack of experience at international level, Smith has still scored 12 goals in her 30 appearances, including a hat-trick against Uzbekistan in April 2022. Smith’s good form for Portland isn’t limited to the 2023 season. In 2022 the forward recorded a club record 14 goals in a single season as she led her team to the NWSL Championship, and she was also named the Championship game MVP. In doing so she became the youngest player in NWSL history to achieve such an honour. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

10843,Predicting the Women’s World Cup: 10 Things We’ll See in 2023,"The Women’s World Cup starts this week, with 32 teams – for the first time in the competition’s history – competing for the top prize in women’s football. The 2023 World Cup is also the first in its history to see two countries host the competition, as Australia and New Zealand welcome the sides. In a tournament full of firsts, here are 10 predictions of our own as the action gets under way. 2019 marked the first Women’s World Cup to use VAR and it’s fair to say it was about as controversial as it has remained in the intervening years. Penalties were retaken, offside decisions felt like they took longer than games themselves, and of course, no one really knew what was going on. Twenty-six penalties were awarded in 2019, the most ever at a World Cup, and an increase on the 22 given in 2015. Those 26 spot-kicks came from just 52 games, so on average 2019 saw a penalty awarded every two games. That did not help England, however. Despite being awarded the joint most penalties (four – tied with the US), they managed to miss three of those, including one in the semi-final. It was the most penalties ever missed at a Women’s World Cup tournament by a single nation. With automated offsides set to make their Women’s World Cup debut, the time spent on VAR should be reduced somewhat, but with officials set to clamp down on time-wasting by increasing stoppage time as they did at the 2022 Qatar World Cup, expect to still be enjoying drawn out halves of football. Cast your mind back to 20 September 2003. A 20-year-old Christine Sinclair gave Canada a 1-0 lead over Germany in the fourth minute of their opening group stage game. Just a day later, a 17-year-old called Marta scored her first ever World Cup goal, the opener in a 3-0 win for Brazil over South Korea. Twenty years later, both players are heading to their sixth World Cup tournament. Both Marta and Sinclair have scored in every World Cup they have played in, and this one is likely to be their last. Marta holds the record for the most goals ever scored at a World Cup while Sinclair is the all-time record international goal scorer for both men’s and women’s football with 190 goals scored across her career. Expect them both to sign off with a bang. This World Cup marks the first time that two countries have hosted the tournament together, and it’s fair to say that New Zealand is the junior partner of the two. Ranked 26th in the world, they have never won a World Cup game in their history. They are also on a rather unfortunate 10-game losing streak. The good news though is that the last game they won was against The Philippines, who are in their group again, so even if they do go out at the group stage, they might be able to get their first World Cup win. Opta’s tournament predictor fancies New Zealand to just qualify out of Group A, ahead of Switzerland. Jitka Klimková’s side are given a 53% chance of progressing into the last 16, a mere 0.3% ahead of Switzerland. If New Zealand don’t qualify for the knockout stages, they’ll become the first host nation to fail to do so in Women’s World Cup history. Meanwhile, if you are Australia, expect to go out at the quarter-final stage. After being eliminated in the group stage in their first three World Cup appearances, Australia have subsequently reached the knockout stages in each of the last four editions but have never progressed further than the quarter-finals. To make matters worse, the last four World Cup hosts have all exited the competition at that point. Only the USA, hosting in 1999 and 2003, have managed to go past that point, winning the competition in 1999 and finishing third in 2003. Home advantage? Not so much at the Women’s World Cup. Two-time Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas was in a race against time to make the World Cup this year, having sustained an ACL injury on the eve of last year’s Euros. The Spanish midfielder won that race though and is heading to her third World Cup tournament. But despite scoring more than 200 career goals, she is yet to score one on the world’s biggest stage. Having turned 29 this year, it seems unlikely that this would be her last World Cup, but go without a goal again and she risks becoming the greatest women’s player never to have scored at the tournament. England’s injury concerns have been well documented heading into this World Cup but the biggest problem they have actually faced has been retirements. England’s average age at the 2019 World Cup was 27.8 years old – that has dropped to 26.4 for this tournament. That makes the Lionesses the 12th youngest squad competing in this year’s tournament. Of the four players who featured in every match for England at the last World Cup, Lucy Bronze is the only one present in this year’s squad, with the right-back having started all but two games in England’s last four international tournaments. The 2019 World Cup was a standout tournament for Bronze, who had the most touches (691), the most passes ending in the final third (136) and the joint most interceptions at the tournament (18). She is also the only defender to have created more than 10 chances over the past two World Cups. Her performances in 2019 propelled her to a number of individual awards, including winning the Silver Ball (awarded to the second-best player) at the tournament itself. Bronze has also scored in the knockout stages of all but one of the international tournaments she has featured in. The four goals she’s scored across the knockout stages of the 2015 World Cup, 2019 World Cup and 2022 Euros make up a third of her total international goals. A nailed down starter for Sarina Wiegman, while there have been some concerns around Bronze’s decline in recent years, she is not someone who shies away from the big stage. She’ll be crucial for the Lionesses once more. While Katie McCabe has still not quite caught up with Kate Longhurst when it comes to the all-time WSL yellow card stakes, McCabe is not afraid to get stuck in. Averaging a yellow card once every five WSL matches, McCabe’s one-match ban for hitting Chloe Kelly on the head with the ball was a highlight of the WSL season. Never ever change, Katie McCabe pic.twitter.com/VHBKmwhV4n The Irish forward, who can also play at full-back, is making her World Cup debut with her country and as captain will surely be finding herself in the thick of the action. Yellow cards meanwhile are on the increase at the World Cup – there were 124 handed out at the last tournament, up from 110 in 2015. But fear not, Ireland fans, even if McCabe does pick up a yellow card or two, there’s always a chance she’ll score a screamer. Her winning goal against Manchester City won the WSL goal of the season. With the expansion of the tournament to 32 teams, the gap between team quality is bigger than ever. Zambia are the lowest-ranked team in the competition, ranked 77th by FIFA, 24 places below Jamaica who were the lowest-ranked team in 2019. The current record defeat was set back in 2019, when the USA beat Thailand 13-0. They were duly criticised for their rather effusive celebrations. But with the gap only growing wider, could an even more lopsided loss be coming? If you were going to worry for anyone, it might be Vietnam who play the US in their opening group match. Vietnam’s biggest-ever defeat came against Australia back in 2015 in an 11-0 loss. However, with standards constantly rising within women’s football, hopefully that USA-Thailand result will hold onto the record forever. Despite the increased number of teams, the Women’s World Cup has slowly become a little less free scoring. From the heady heights of an average 3.8 goals per game in the early 1990s, recent tournaments have seen the average settle around 2.8. Defences are getting better, and while you might see some blowouts in the group stages, by the time we reach the knockouts things will tighten up. Ten of the 16 knockout stage matches in 2019 were decided by one goal. Alex Morgan was pipped to the 2019 Golden Boot by Megan Rapinoe despite all three of Morgan, Rapinoe and Ellen White scoring six goals across the tournament. While Rapinoe might have ended up scoring six (and racking up three assists) in fewer minutes, and therefore taking home the shiny statue, Morgan has the opportunity to do something no player has ever done before at a Women’s World Cup, and finish as top scorer twice. Since 2019, Ellen White has retired and Megan Rapinoe is unlikely to play a starring role for the US, so Morgan has a clear run at this one. That said, there are plenty of other top strikers at the tournament who will be looking to walk away with the Golden Boot. Norway’s Ada Hegerberg and Australia’s Sam Kerr have been two of the world’s most prolific goalscorers in recent years, with Norway in particular looking like they have a kind group. Morgan herself knows what a plus that can be – five of her six goals in 2019 came in that 13-0 win over Thailand. It looks like six goals should just about do it as well. Not since Michelle Akers scored 10 in 1991 has a player needed more than seven goals to win the award Okay, no one wants them to win it again (unless you’re American presumably) but it is hard to look past the US winning a third consecutive World Cup title. Our tournament predictor certainly has them as clear favourites. The draw is slightly weighted in their favour with six top-10 ranked teams hidden away from them in the bottom half. Plus, given the Netherlands are in their group they’d only be able to meet them as late as the semi-finals. Becky Sauerbrunn is clearly a big loss for them – going into a tournament without your captain is a serious blow – but they still have a core of the team who won in 2019. Seven of the team that started the 2019 final are in the US squad and youngsters like Sophia Smith, Trinity Rodman and Naomi Girma are worthy replacements for some of the veterans who have missed out. The Americans have never finished lower than third at a World Cup, and every time they roll around people ponder whether the rest of the world have finally caught up with them. Most of the time, the answer to that question is no. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

10848,Who Will Win the 2023 Women’s World Cup? Opta’s Women’s World Cup Predictions,"The Opta supercomputer has provided its 2023 Women’s World Cup predictions. Who will come out on top in Australia and New Zealand? The Women’s World Cup starts this week, with 32 teams – for the first time in the competition’s history – competing for the top prize in women’s football. Co-hosts New Zealand and Australia are both in action on the opening day, taking on Norway and the Republic of Ireland respectively. Which players will star? Who are the favourites? What about the dark horses? Everything is covered in our Women’s World Cup predictions, as the United States bid to triumph for a third consecutive edition. Let’s start with the obvious – the two-time reigning world champions. The USA are favourites to defend their crown for a second tournament running, an attempt that should start smoothly as they are predicted to win Group H – which also includes the Netherlands, Portugal and Vietnam – with relative ease. Since suffering three straight defeats in late 2022, the USWNT have won their last nine games by an aggregate of 21-2. Not bad. Their squad might be on the older side – indeed, captain Megan Rapinoe is playing at her final World Cup following her retirement announcement – but it is still packed with quality. The USWNT have won four world titles, taking the trophy in half of the eight World Cups played. They are aiming to become the first side (men’s or women’s) to win three successive World Cups, while they have never finished below third in any edition of the tournament. Vlatko Andonovski’s team head into the tournament on the back of 12 straight wins in World Cup play – a record. In those 12 games, they have amassed a goal difference of +32 (37 goals for, five against). They have won their World Cup openers in six of the eight tournaments, drawing the other two, including a competition-record 13-0 victory over Thailand in 2019. Rapinoe has been directly involved in more goals than any other player over the last three editions of the World Cup (15 in 17 matches); the 38-year-old – along with Alex Morgan – scored six goals in the 2019 tournament, seeing the American duo join England’s Ellen White at the top of the scoring charts and share the golden boot. No player has ever been top scorer in more than one edition of the competition. Five of the USA’s eight knockout goals were scored by Rapinoe, making her just the third player in the competition’s history to net at least five times in the knockout rounds of a single World Cup. The previous two players were also Americans – Carli Lloyd (six in 2015) and Michelle Akers (seven in 1991). With 34-year-old Morgan, who was the USA’s leading scorer in qualifying with three goals in five appearances, also potentially set for her last World Cup, Rose Lavelle, at 28, is ready to take the mantle up from the veteran campaigners. Lavelle scored in the final in 2019, becoming the fifth-youngest player, at 24 years and 54 days, to net in a showpiece match in the competition. Opta Predictions – USA The second favourites, according to our prediction model, are England. The Lionesses claimed silverware on home soil in last year’s UEFA Women’s Euros, beating Germany 2-1 in the final at a packed Wembley Stadium. Chloe Kelly was the hero for England in that match, and the pressure might well be on the Manchester City attacker to step up in the absence of Beth Mead, who along with her Arsenal team-mate Leah Williamson will miss the tournament due to an ACL injury. Mead was England’s top scorer in qualifying (13 goals from 10 games), while Wiegman is also without Ellen White, the Lionesses’ record goalscorer who called time on her career after the Euros. England are making their sixth World Cup appearance, having qualified for a fifth successive tournament. They are one of three teams, along with Germany and the USA, to reach the quarters in each of the last four tournaments, while only the Lionesses and the USA have made the last four in the last two World Cups. Only Germany, in 2003 and 2007, have won the World Cup while also being reigning European champions. They should easily progress from Group H, which includes Denmark (1.45% chance of winning the tournament), China (1.22%) and minnows Haiti (0.04%), and our predictor model gives England a 42.9% chance of making the semi-finals. England’s opening game sees them take on Haiti – they have won their opening World Cup fixture on just two occasions. In their final two group matches in each of their previous tournament appearances, however, England have posted a record of eight wins, one draw and one defeat.  The Lionesses have netted in each of their last 13 World Cup matches, which is the longest active streak in the competition, having last being shut out by France in 2015. Should England score in their first two group matches, they would equal the longest such run in tournament history, which was set by Norway between 1991 and 1999. Barcelona star Lucy Bronze is in England’s squad and is set to play a key role once again. Only compatriot Steph Houghton (1,290) has played more minutes across the last two World Cups than Bronze (1,180), who also made a total of 37 interceptions across those tournaments – more than any other player. She was also pivotal in the Euros last year, providing two assists from a total of 10 chances created. Coach Wiegman has won 18 of her 19 games as a manager in major Women’s international competitions (World Cup and Euros) – the only game she failed to win was the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup final with the Netherlands (2-0 vs. USA). Opta Predictions – England Putellas’ return is a timely boost for Spain, but they head into the tournament amid a contentious dispute over working conditions, with 15 players having withdrawn from selection last year. Just three of those have been included in Jorge Vilda’s squad. Nevertheless, they are still ranked as the third favourites to go all the way. They are set to play at the World Cup for a third time and their best performance came in 2019, when they reached the last 16, so there’s plenty for them to improve on if they are to test the heavyweights. However, Spain qualified by finishing top of their group, and were one of the four European teams to win all of their qualifiers. Spain are big favourites to win Group C, which also includes Costa Rica, Japan and Zambia. Opta Predictions – Spain Runners-up to England at the Euros, Germany possess one of the strongest squads and are sure to be there or thereabouts. They are one of seven teams to have qualified for all nine Women’s World Cup tournaments, including being one of only three European nations alongside Norway and Sweden to play in each edition. Germany are unbeaten across their eight World Cup openers, and have lost only once in 24 group games. Colombia, South Korea and tournament debutants Morocco should pose little bother when it comes to progressing from Group H, while only the USA have kept more clean sheets at the finals than the Germans. Sara Dabritz was their star performer in 2019, scoring three goals. No midfielder had as many shots (21) or shots on target (10) during that tournament, while Dabritz has found the net in four of her six World Cup group games. Opta predictions – Germany Another European team to win all of their 10 qualifiers was France, who have Brazil to face in Group F, but Herve Renard’s team are predicted to progress with ease from a pool that also includes Jamaica and Panama. Renard – who guided Saudi Arabia to a famous victory over Argentina at last year’s men’s World Cup in Qatar – took over earlier this year, following the ill-tempered end to Corinne Diacre’s tenure. Renard is a highly experienced coach in the men’s game, and Les Bleues have won three of their four games under him so far, though that loss came to tournament hosts Australia in their most-recent outing. France failed to make home advantage count in 2019, though they have reached the last eight in each of the three previous editions. Wendie Renard – who withdrew from selection under Diacre – has returned to take the armband. She scored four goals in the 2019 tournament, more than any other France player, and was the only defender to score multiple goals during that World Cup, with three of those coming with her head. Opta predictions – France One of the strongest teams in women’s football, Sweden are one of seven teams to have competed at every Women’s World Cup. In fact, no team has played as many games at World Cup finals without winning the tournament as Sweden (40). They have finished runners-up once (in 2003) and third on two occasions. They went through qualifying unbeaten and have lost only three of their 15 group stage games played in the competition in the 21st century (W8 D4), with all three of those defeats coming against the USA. Sweden will play South Africa, Italy and Argentina in a competitive Group G. Opta predictions – Sweden They are not considered among the favourites, with only a 3.3% chance of winning the tournament, but Brazil head into the tournament as the eighth best team in the world and should not be wholly discounted from at the very least going on a deep run. In Marta, they have the top goalscorer in Women’s World Cup history, with the 37-year-old registering 17 goals in 20 appearances. She has scored in each of the last five editions of the World Cup, a feat only otherwise achieved by Canada veteran Sinclair. Among the teams that have previously played in three World Cups, Brazil are the only one to have always won their opening game (8/8). They kept seven clean sheets in those eight games, with the combined aggregate score being 23-1 in their favour, while they have only lost one of their 18 group matches. Their coach, Pia Sundhage, will become the first coach to lead a three different teams at the World Cup finals, having taken charge of the USA in 2011 and Sweden in 2015. Opta predictions – Brazil With Sam Kerr leading their line, Australia should be confident of a deep run. Our predictor model rates their chances of going all the way at just 5.88%, albeit that does have them as the sixth favourites. Kerr scored seven goals during the 2022 Asian Cup and after failing to net in her first eight World Cup games, the Chelsea striker has scored five times in her last four such matches. After being eliminated in the group stages in their first three World Cup appearances, Australia have subsequently reached the knockout stages in each of the last four editions but have never progressed further than the quarter-finals. If Australia are involved, then expect goals – none of their 26 World Cup matches have ended goalless. New Zealand, meanwhile, are likely to be involved in a tussle with Switzerland and the Philippines to claim second in Group A, in which Norway are the big favourites. They are taking part in their sixth World Cup, and a fifth in a row, yet they are yet to win a single game at the finals. New Zealand are also the only team to have made five or more appearances at the tournament without ever reaching the knockout stages. New Zealand have kept just one clean sheet from their 15 World Cup games, while they have always lost their opening match.

10849,"Women’s World Cup 2023 Group H Preview: Germany, Colombia, South Korea, Morocco","Things are about to get heated – or chilly, meteorologically speaking – down under as teams prepare for the ninth edition of the Women’s World Cup. The favourites, the underdogs, the dark horses are all running the same track for women’s football’s most-coveted prize. Group H has a clear favourite in Germany, but the other three nations have all gone close to glory in recent times, meaning a fiercely contested first round could be on the cards here. The two-time World Cup winners are an indomitable force in international football. The No.2 ranked nation, according to FIFA, are being trumpeted as one of the likeliest to go all the way in Australia and New Zealand. The Germans have featured in every single edition of the Women’s World Cup since its inception in 1991. After becoming the first nation to successfully defend their crown in 2007, Germany are eager to add a third star to their badge. However, Germany’s slightly poor run of results in 2023 has raised questions of head coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg. They’ve been defeated twice and held to a draw once in their five games this year. A recent stoppage-time loss to Zambia in the lead up to the World Cup has concerned supporters, but Germany are notorious for underwhelming in preparatory games before excelling at major tournaments. Remember the 3-2 loss to Serbia before the UEFA Women’s Euro 2022 last year? This was also the only loss they endured in their World Cup qualification campaign. The 2022 Euros runners-up finished top in qualifying with a record of nine wins and one loss in 10 games, scoring a whopping 47 goals, highlighting a real proficiency in front of goal. Not that this is anything new for them; after all, Germany (121) and the United States (138) are the only nations to score 100 or more goals at the Women’s World Cup. In fact, two Germans feature among the Women’s World Cup’s top five all-time leading scorers. Legendary forward, Brigit Prinz (14), is second only to Marta (17), while Bettina Wiegmann is one of three players tied in fifth on 11.  The current squad boasts some prolific goalscorers as well, however. Germany’s striker position is an interesting conundrum. In Lea Schüller and Alexandra Popp, Voss-Tecklenburg has two very able players to choose from. Bayern Munich’s 25-year-old forward, Schüller, is coming off the back of a 14-goal domestic season with the Bavarians. She finished as the joint-second top scorer, averaging 0.86 goals per 90 minutes. She is consistently able to get into good shooting positions, as highlighted by her average shot quality in the league. Among players with more than 25 shots, Schüller had the highest average expected goals (xG) value per attempt (excluding penalties) of 0.20 in the Frauen Bundesliga. She also gets plenty of shots away, averaging 3.8 per 90 in the league, behind only Ewa Pajor (5.6). Schüller possesses excellent predatory instincts and awareness inside the box, constantly looking to orient herself towards goal. The former Essen striker was the second top scorer during the World Cup qualification campaign with 15 goals, just behind Belgium’s Tessa Wullaert (17). But the experienced Popp, who was the joint-top scorer at the Euros last year with six, is also competing for a spot. The veteran enjoyed a very fruitful campaign in the Bundesliga, with her tally of 16 goals more than anyone else. The 32-year-old averaged a goal every 3.6 shots and was incredibly efficient in converting her chances; no player had a higher over-performance on their non-penalty expected goals (npxG) than Popp (+7.0). The physically imposing and intense presence of Popp is even more valuable in knockout scenarios, when she can swing the game and score goals from dead-ball situations with her aerial ability. Her 68.7% aerial duels success rate was the fifth highest in the Frauen Bundesliga last term, potentially giving Germany an added edge over their opponents. Schüller has got the nod when both have been fit, but it remains to be seen if Voss-Tecklenburg will throw us any more curveballs, like playing Svenja Huth at right-back against Zambia in the lead up to the tournament. Either way, Germany have a good problem in the striker position with two very capable goalscorers, each offering different qualities on the pitch. Germany’s talent pipeline has produced some of the finest players in recent generations, and they are not slowing down. After shifting their focus to youth development, the Germans are reaping the rewards. They have a team set up for success in the current cycle as well as the future with a core of Lena Oberdorf, Jule Brand, Klara Bühl, Sophia Kleinherne, Sjoeke Nüsken and Schüller all 25 or younger. The German squad has an average age of just over 26 years, with an excellent blend of talented youngsters and proven winners. With injuries to Giulia Gwinn and Carolin Simon, the German backline has places up for grabs. While Felicitas Rauch will deputise at left-back after Simon suffered an ACL rupture in their last friendly, the right-back position is much more open. Wolfsburg’s Kathrin Hendrich has experience playing the position at club level despite being a centre-back, and Voss-Tecklenburg has previously used Kleinherne in that role. They look like the most straightforward options for the Euro 2022 runners-up, but the coach sprung a surprise against Zambia by playing veteran attacker Huth there. Questions have been raised of their defence, with Germany unable to keep a clean sheet in any of their past three games. It’s an area that appears a little less stacked than the other two departments in Germany’s 4-3-3, but there is no shortage of quality throughout the squad. The Women’s Asian Cup runners-up are the next-best ranked (17th) side in the group, according to FIFA rankings. They are making their fourth appearance at the Women’s World Cup and third in a row. Their 2019 campaign left a lot to be desired, though, as they were eliminated in the group stage without picking up a point. Their record at World Cups in general is poor, being put up against at least one of Norway, France and Brazil in each of their previous three appearances. They’ve conceded multiple goals in eight of their 10 games at the tournament and failed to score in six. South Korea defeated World Cup co-hosts Australia last year en route to their maiden Asian Cup final, which earned them a ticket to the World Cup. They even led by two goals at half-time in the final but showcased an inability to control the game in the second half, conceding three times as China clinched glory late on. Colin Bell’s side are on a run of three straight wins coming into the tournament, beating World Cup debutants Zambia (twice) and Haiti. They participated in the Arnold Clark Cup at the start of 2023 but couldn’t manage a win despite pushing Belgium and Italy all the way, suffering a pair of 2-1 defeats. Nevertheless, Bell’s side have proven an ability to be solid at the back while letting their difference-makers do the job in the final third. Their 3-4-2-1 is geared towards defending in numbers and being defensively sound, but they do lack the numbers in midfield to offer them control. The attack largely looks to the brilliance of the likes of Ji So-yun and Lee Geum-min. South Korea will once again look to all-time leading goalscorer Ji to deliver the goods in attack. The former Chelsea player has made the joint-most appearances for the national team (145, tied with Cho So-hyun), scoring a record 67 goals.  She is widely regarded as one of the finest foreign players in Women’s Super League (WSL) history, having spent eight years with Chelsea after joining them in 2014. She won six league titles and the Women’s FA Cup four times during her time in England. The diminutive midfielder is a magician on the ball and can impact games by scoring and creating equally well. She has set-piece mastery in her repertoire as well, making her a threat in open play and at dead-ball situations. That technical brilliance shines through in her long-range shooting too, with this varied skillset making her dangerous all over the attacking half. Only Australia’s Sam Kerr (7) scored more goals than Ji (5, tied with 4 others) during the 2022 AFC Women’s Asian Cup. The South Korea star converted five of her six shots on target, including a late winner against the Matildas in the quarter-finals. But beyond being a goal threat, Ji is blessed with excellent vision along with the weight and timing on her passes, making her capable of threading the needle in crowded areas. During the 2019 Women’s World Cup, Ji made nine passes that broke through the opponent’s defensive line, and six passes that broke through a line and found a teammate in the penalty area. No player in the tournament managed to find a teammate in the area more often with a line-breaking pass than the South Korea star, despite them exiting at the group stage. Another key player in the South Korea setup is Brighton forward Lee. While not the most prolific goalscorer, the former Manchester City player shines through her incredible link-up play. She likes to get on the ball and play lay-offs, acting as a conduit between the lines. Lee has been sharp in front of goal this year, though, netting five times in her past three outings for South Korea. Usually deployed as one of the 10s or as the striker, she will be key to the team’s hopes of making this a memorable tournament. Colombia will be making their third appearance at the Women’s World Cup, returning to the global stage after missing out four years ago. They were up against France, Mexico and England in their previous appearance back in 2015, managing to score in each of their three group games and earning their only win in World Cup history (against France) to reach the knockout stages in third. Nelson Abadía’s side are coming into this World Cup with a mixed bag of results. Last year was generally positive, losing only once – the Copa América Femenina final to Brazil – between the start of July and the end of 2022. This year, they’ve scored in all of the seven matches they’ve played, but only two have ended in victory. That run to the Copa América Femenina final was their third silver medal in the last four editions of the competition. They had an unblemished record before that game, winning all five games en route to the showpiece. Colombia have some recognisable names who are lighting up the Spanish league. Manuela Vanegas (Real Sociedad), Mayra Ramírez (Levante), Leicy Santos (Atlético Madrid) and Linda Caicedo (Real Madrid) all ply their trade in Liga F and will be key in the side’s hopes of progressing out of the group stage. The trio of Ramírez, Vanegas and Caicedo were among Colombia’s five joint-top scorers at the Copa América Femenina, with two goals each. Vanegas has been vital to Real Sociedad’s build-up and is an important ball-player for the side when trying to retain and recycle possession. Only Mapi León (1,950) attempted more passes than the Colombian defender (1,838) in Liga F. Ramírez arrives at the World Cup on the back of a spectacular domestic season, helping Levante secure a place in the UEFA Women’s Champions League qualifiers. She was one of the two players in Liga F to reach double digits in both goals (14) and assists (11). Her tally of 25 goal involvements saw her rank fourth for such contributions, while her 11 assists was only bettered by Caroline Weir and Nerea Eizagirre (both 12). Part of what makes the 24-year-old so impressive is her purpose and positivity on the ball. She ranked second among Liga F forwards for progressive carries (192), while only Racheal Kundananji (75) registered more carries that ended in a shot or chance created than Ramírez (46). But in terms of carries leading to an assist, no one bettered her seven. She showcases incredible balance when running with the ball, allowing her to ride contact and provide penetration into dangerous areas. As for the next generation of Colombian talent, 18-year-old Real Madrid winger Caicedo is a beacon of light. The youngster moved to Spain after her 18th birthday in February and, despite playing just 678 minutes for her new club, she finished the season as the fourth-highest assist provider (four) in the squad, also averaging the best assists per-90 figure (0.53). The youngster is also an excellent ball carrier, with her 9.96 progressive carries per 90 being the second most in Real Madrid’s squad (minimum 19 minutes played). She is very economical with her touches and uses her frame well to shield possession, making her secure as well as progressive on the ball. She often operates in a free role in the Colombia side, commonly drifting inside from a wide-left position and working from the half-spaces or central areas. She shows a great understanding for combination and link-up play in the final third and is explosive with tidy footwork in one-v-one situations, making her an excellent operator in tight spaces. Her 5.2 attempted take-ons per 90 was second only to Athenea del Castillo in the Real Madrid squad, and despite those dribbles largely coming in the final third of the pitch, she boasts a success rate of 56.4%, evidence of her tremendous technical ability. She will be key in Colombia’s offensive mechanics. Morocco are the second-lowest-ranked nation (72) at this World Cup and are one of the eight debutants. They are also the first Arab country to qualify for the FIFA Women’s World Cup. Their World Cup ticket was secured via a historic campaign in the Women’s African Cup of Nations (WAFCON) on home soil last year. They finished as runners-up at the tournament, losing to South Africa in the final. The country has seen a massive boost in its women’s footballing structure in recent years and they are slowly reaping the rewards. Morocco averaged the most possession (60.2%) and the best passing accuracy (79.5%) during the 2022 WAFCON, but it’s unlikely they will have a monopoly on the ball at the World Cup. Morocco are led by former Olympique Lyonnais Fémenin head coach Reynald Pedros. The two-time UWCL winning manager has tweaked his approach in the lead up to the World Cup, looking more likely to adopt a pragmatic 4-4-2 over their usual 4-3-3.  They earned back-to-back 0-0 draws against Switzerland and Italy earlier this month; those results arguably flattered them a little, though, as Morocco continue to give up quality chances. Shoring up the defence might still be their best bet going into the tournament. However, this puts extra pressure on their star forward… Rosella Ayane scored the winning penalty against Nigeria in the semi-final of the WAFCON and etched her name in Moroccan women’s football folklore forever.  The versatile Tottenham forward is the lynchpin in attack for Morocco. She is capable of playing across the frontline but will probably be tasked with operating centrally at the World Cup. Born in Reading, Ayane decided to play for Morocco two years ago, having represented England at youth level. The 27-year-old has since scored nine in 21 appearances for her adopted country. Goalscoring will be her main agenda with the national team, unlike at club level where she is expected to create chances from the flanks using her crossing and vision. Released by Chelsea in 2016, Ayane has gone on to hone her skills and become a well-rounded forward who is adept at creating and scoring with either foot.  She can stretch the field with her positioning and show up between lines as an outlet while remaining a threatening option in behind. For Morocco, a lot will rely on her effectiveness on and off the ball in the final third. Another key player for Pedros’ side will be Ghizlane Chebbak. She was involved in the joint-most goals during the 2022 WAFCON (3 goals, 1 assist – level with Nigeria’s Rasheedat Ajibade). Chebbak also made at least 91 more successful passes than any other player in that tournament (337) and created the most chances (17). It’s going to be a Herculean undertaking for Morocco to pull off a result against European giants Germany, but they could threaten either of the other competing nations in the group.

10850,"Women’s World Cup 2023 Group G Preview: Sweden, Italy, Argentina, South Africa","Often the bridesmaids, never the brides, Sweden are back to try and finally win their first FIFA Women’s World Cup, while also trying to get the best out of their star player on the international stage. Italy return for another crack, hoping to do significantly better than they did at last summer’s UEFA European Women’s Championship, while Argentina and South Africa will both be looking to put a spanner in the works for their European opponents. Here’s our Group G preview. The Swedish women’s top-flight, Damallsvenskan, has dropped to sixth place in the UEFA rankings. After many years of being at the top of that list, Swedish women’s football is trying to figure out how to move forward in a world where the game is snowballing. However, the Swedish women’s national team still ranks third in the world on FIFA’s list. When the ninth edition of the FIFA Women’s World Cup kicks off on 20 July, 32 years after the inaugural tournament was played in China (1991), Sweden will be one of seven to have played in every single edition, along with the United States, Germany, Norway, Brazil, Japan and Nigeria. The only time Sweden have not made it further than the group stage was in 2007. On all other occasions, the Swedes have participated in the knockout stage, competing for glory. No team has played as many games as Sweden in the Women’s World Cup without ever winning the tournament, which is a record they’ll be keen to end with victory in Australia and New Zealand. They have played 40 matches in the tournament’s history and reached the semi-finals in four of the previous eight editions, making it to the final only once in 2003, when they lost 2-1 against Germany. In an interview with SVT Sport ahead of the World Cup, Sweden and AC Milan’s Kosovare Asllani said: “We are not the only favourites, but you should never count Sweden out. That’s the dream we’re chasing; we want to win that gold medal – nothing else.” The creative midfielder has a point. Sweden have so far always levelled up their game in big, international tournaments, even though they received a lot of criticism during last summer’s UEFA Women’s Euros, which they were knocked out of by hosts England in the semi-finals after entering the tournament as one of the favourites to win it. The squad selected to represent the colours of blue and yellow in this edition of the Women’s World Cup know the drill. They know what it will take to go all the way. But do they have what it takes? No two teams have faced each other more often at the Women’s World Cup than USA and Sweden, who have met in six of the previous eight tournaments, with all meetings coming in the group stage. This will be the first tournament since 1999 that the two are in separate groups, but their respective roads to the final can cross in the semi-finals if they both win their groups and go on to reach the final four. And speaking of the USA, Sweden have been on the Women’s World Cup podium four times, the second-best total for a team, only behind the USA, who have done so eight times. As already mentioned, Sweden have never won the World Cup but finished as runners-up in 2003 and have won the bronze medal on three occasions (1991, 2011 and 2019). Sweden will probably be happy to have avoided the USA this time since they have lost only three of their 15 group stage games played in the competition in the 21st century, with all three defeats coming against the USWNT. After Sweden’s performance at last summer’s Euros, there was endless discussion and criticism towards Sweden’s Diamantbollen winner in 2021 and 2022 – Fridolina Rolfö. People expect the Barcelona star to perform magic whenever she steps out on the pitch wearing the blue and yellow shirt because of the club she plays for. At Barca, Rolfö is an attacking left-back with the role of creating chances from the flank. The focus should be on what a player like Rolfö can add for her team, whether at club or international level, when she is given a role that allows her creative abilities to shine. The tall and strong Swede with excellent progressive passing had an impressive record of eight assists and 47 chances created for Barcelona last season. Her progressive ball-carrying led to 19 shots, one goal, two assists and 14 chances created. These abilities give the Swedish head coach a hard time when deciding where a player like Rolfö could add the most value to an already very talented team. Rolfö has played in the number 10 position, but that often leads to her receiving the ball with her back to goal, and if there’s one weakness in her game, maybe that is it. What she does week in and week out with Barcelona is perhaps something she struggles to apply to Sweden as the style of play differs massively, as do the abilities of the players around her. The idea that Rolfö will come out on the pitch wearing the Swedish match shirt and do everything should be dismissed immediately – not because she isn’t a world-class player, but because Sweden’s style of play is built on teamwork rather than one individual. “Our first attacker is our first defender,” said Sweden manager Peter Gerhardsson when talking about the role of central striker Stina Blackstenius, which points to the fact that Sweden defend as a team and attack as a team. With this mantra, they try to avoid too many 1v1 situations out of possession, which they will have to work on to improve. It will affect the rest of the team if Blackstenius doesn’t defend well out of possession, meaning that the Arsenal forward and Rolfö will both need to perform at the highest level, but they are not alone in the burden to make it happen for Sweden, no matter what people might think. There have been concerns raised about Sweden’s defence in the last year, which had been a notable strength for the last decade. Many Swedish reporters and pundits have discussed the experienced key players’ lack of playing time in the Swedish backline. But is it true? Magdalena Eriksson (formerly of Chelsea, now at Bayern Munich) was one of five players in Emma Hayes’ side who played the most games last season across all competitions, along with Sam Kerr, Guro Reiten, Erin Cuthbert and Niamh Charles, making 36 appearances overall. In the qualifiers, she was one of five Swedish players with the most appearances as the only defender, accompanied by Rolfö, Lina Hurtig (Arsenal), Filippa Angeldahl (Manchester City) and Olivia Schough (FC Rosengård). That Gerhardsson continues to show plenty of faith in the former Chelsea skipper is in no doubt. Another worry has been the prolonged absence of Caroline Seger (FC Rosengård), who comes into this tournament with only 101 minutes of playing time with her club team from last season. Sweden’s captain is the outfield player to have started the most games at a Women’s World Cup without scoring a goal (17). However, she has so often been a vital part of the Swedish defensive unit, making 18 interceptions during the 2019 tournament, a joint-high among all players along with England’s Lucy Bronze and the Netherlands’ Desiree van Lunteren. How much of an impact will it have on Scandinavia’s best-ranked national team to not have their captain fit and ready to play a full 90 minutes when it all starts? Seger has been the glue to link play for Sweden, with Gerhardsson alternating between a back three and a back four in his efforts to implement more of a ball-playing style when in possession. Still, you will see Sweden seek to attack as fast as possible when winning the ball in areas where they can utilise their counter-attacking strengths, and it is probably in this way they can hurt opponents most. However, looking at what is about to come, Sweden have lost four Women’s World Cup games despite scoring the opening goal, more than any other team in the competition’s history. On a more positive note, they can be optimistic ahead of their opener against South Africa on July 23, as Sweden are unbeaten in the opening game of their last four WWCs, having lost their first four such games. The Italians will appear in their fourth Women’s World Cup as they have managed to qualify for back-to-back tournaments for the first time. They reached the quarter-finals in two of their past three appearances in the competition. They will travel to New Zealand and Australia after finishing top of their qualifying group, winning nine and losing only one of their 10 games, keeping nine clean sheets. Italy start their campaign against Argentina on 24 July, and it bodes well that they are unbeaten in their opening games at the Women’s World Cup (W2 D1). However, they have also always lost exactly one match in each of their previous three group stages in the tournament. Roma have just had a historic season in which they won the club’s first Serie A league title while also playing in the UEFA Women’s Champions League. Six players from Roma can be found in the top 10 for attacking sequence involvements from the 2022-2023 season, and four of those are Italians selected by head coach Milena Bertolini to play in the World Cup: Manuela Giugliani, Valentina Giavinti, Giada Greggi and Annamaria Serturini. Yet, the player with the most goals and appearances for Italy in qualifying was Cristina Girelli (Juventus), who played 10 games and scored eight times. It will be curious to see if Bertolini uses the Roma players to attack, or will she go with her more tried and tested pairing of Girelli and her club teammate Barbara Bonansea? When Italy did not even make it past the group stage at last summer’s Euros, many probably raised an eyebrow. Mainly because they failed to score, but also because they conceded seven goals. With that in mind, when it comes to Italy’s performances in the last World Cup in France 2019, only China (84%) had a better save percentage than Italy (83%), who were also one of the two teams, alongside Norway (23), to make 20+ saves in the last edition (20). Most of the time, Italian football is played from the heart, but they did not make it happen last summer. Bertolini has hopefully prepared her players better for this challenge because if they are unable to make it to the knockout stages down under, it could get ugly for the head coach in charge of a nation that has seen women’s football take giant steps forward in recent years. Argentina will participate in their fourth Women’s World Cup, though they have never been past the group stage, failing to do so in 2003, 2007 and 2019. There will be a belief that nothing is impossible following the men’s success – led by Lionel Messi – in Qatar last year. No country has ever held the World Cup titles for both men and women simultaneously. They are here to play in the 2023 edition of the World Cup after qualifying via the 2022 Copa América Femenina, where they finished in third place. Argentina have failed to score in 67% of their Women’s World Cup games (six out of nine), the highest percentage among the teams to have played more than six games. Although, in 2019 they lost just once after losing each of their previous six matches in the history of the competition, and were the only team that managed to avoid defeat in a game that saw them trail by three or more goals, coming back from 3-0 down to draw 3-3 with Scotland. What may be the biggest concern for Argentina is that they have conceded on average 4.1 goals per match at the Women’s World Cup (37 goals in nine games), the highest ratio among teams to have taken part in at least three tournaments. Yamila Rodríguez (Palmeiras) was Argentina’s top scorer in the 2022 Copa América Femenina. She scored six goals from an expected goals value of just 3.0 during that tournament, with her +3.0 margin the biggest of all players. Some experts in the country have also mentioned the double pivot in the midfield; Daiana Falfán (Palmeiras) and Lorena Benítez (UAI Urquiza) will likely be key. It could get exciting for Argentina in the first match when they play Italy, who some will see as beatable. If they manage to defeat them, it will put the Azzurre under tremendous pressure and could see Group G become very interesting early on. South Africa will participate in their second Women’s World Cup after debuting in 2019, when they lost all three games. They qualified for the 2023 edition by winning the 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations, their first title ever. In that competition, they scored more goals than any other nation with 10. South Africa also made the most successful passes per game in that competition, 335. As many other teams have, South Africa demanded better support from their federation. This led to a boycott from the players, who refused to play in the team’s warm-up match against Botswana ahead of the World Cup. The reasons for the players refusing to play were many. One was that the pitch the match was supposed to be played on was in bad condition and they did not want to risk injury. Another reason was the financial agreement with the South African Football Federation before the tournament. According to the players, they receive historically hefty monetary compensation from FIFA but nothing from their federation. The result of the match? South Africa lost 5-0 to Botswana as the management had to use other players, with the youngest of them just 13 years old. However, they resolved the financial conflict soon after, seeing the players receive about £9,000 each, in addition to the £23,000 FIFA previously promised to all participating players. During their only appearance in the competition back in 2019, South Africa had just four shots on target. That was a joint-low that year alongside New Zealand, scoring one goal in their opening game against Spain (a 3-1 defeat). They also had only 17 touches in the opposition box, the fewest for a team during the tournament. They hope to make more of an impact this time, maybe with the help of Thembi Kgatiana of NWSL side Racing Louisville, who scored that goal against Spain in 2019. On top of that, Kgatiana was responsible for three of South Africa’s four shots in the tournament in France, but scored from her only shot on target, fired from outside the box. South Africa’s tournament starts against Sweden on 23 July. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

10851,"Women’s World Cup 2023 Group F Preview: France, Brazil, Jamaica, Panama","France and Brazil headline Group F at the 2023 Women’s World Cup, with the two footballing powerhouses expected to coast through to the knockout stages. Jamaica and Panama will aim to have a say in that, with there certainly being the potential for a major shock or two. With the big kick-off just around the corner, look ahead to the action with our Group F preview. No one loves drama more than French footballers in the lead up to an international tournament, and this year has been no different. Long-term coach Corinne Diacre was sacked in March after several senior players said they would no longer play for the national team if she continued in charge. Enter Hervé Renard. Renard is not the first manager to have led teams at both a men’s and women’s World Cup – John Herdman did it with Canada in 2015 for the women and 2022 for the men – but he is certainly the first manager to go to two World Cups within twelve months. 45 mins in: ""what are you thinking with that high line?!""FT: ""Hervé Renard, football genius!""#ARGKSA | #FIFAWorldCup pic.twitter.com/EBvCZZNu4O With Renard having historically managed underdogs, it will be interesting to see how he approaches leading a French team who have long underperformed relative to their quality at international tournaments. When Saudi Arabia upset Argentina in the opening group game of the 2022 World Cup, they used a very high line to catch Argentina offside 10 times. For a team as technically accomplished as France, there will be an expectation to have a lot more of the ball. Of the twelve teams to have played more than 10 games at a World Cup since 2011, France have had the highest average share of possession (57.4%). For France, Eugénie Le Sommer will have the opportunity to overtake Gaëthane Thiney as France’s all-time World Cup appearance record holder. She ranked third in the D1 Arkema, the French top flight, in 2022-23 for expected goals (9.55) despite playing only 1,017 of a possible 1,980 minutes (51.4%), while her seven goals and five assists in the league represented her highest tally of goal contributions for Lyon since the 2018/19 season. Le Sommer was one of the players who had been ostracised by former manager Diacre, meaning she did not even go to Euro 2022. Her return to the squad comes at an opportune moment as their top scorer in qualification, Marie-Antoinette Katoto, has not recovered from an ACL injury in time to make the tournament. Standing at 6-foot-1, French captain Renard excels in both penalty areas. She was their top scorer at the 2019 World Cup with four goals, although the fact a centre-back scored more goals than anyone else was rather damning of Diacre’s management and how France performed. However, it’s clear opponents struggle to deal with her in the air and the three headers she scored in 2019 was the most for any player in the tournament. Her 39 aerials won was also the fifth most in the D1 Arkema last season, which is all the more impressive given how dominant Lyon are in the league and consequently how rarely they face attacks compared to other teams. However, she is not just a player who is going to look to defend the box. Her 154 progressive passes were the highest in the league and her passes into the final third (132) was the second most. She really is a special player. Astonishingly, this is the first World Cup since 1991 that midfielder Formiga won’t appear at, while Marta has already announced this will be her last. The Brazilian legend has scored in every edition of the tournament she has played in, making her one of only three players in football to have scored at five different World Cups (alongside Christine Sinclair and Cristiano Ronaldo). She is the competition’s all-time top scorer with 17 goals in 20 appearances. The news that Brazilian defender Rafaelle Souza was leaving Arsenal was a big blow, but Brazilians will be hoping she can continue her form from last season into the World Cup. Rafaelle showed what an all-round defender she can be in the WSL, but her ball-playing ability is what truly makes her stand out. A left-footed centre-back who can pass and carry the ball, she averaged 5.5 passes into the final third per 90 in the WSL. And of course, she brings that Brazilian flair too – her 12 successful take-ons was the highest for a centre-back in the league. She will be captaining Brazil, having missed the 2019 World Cup with injury, but previously was part of a centre-back partnership at the 2015 edition that did not concede a single goal in the group stages. Brazil may be the only South American team to have featured in every edition of the World Cup, but the 2007 finalists have not progressed past the quarter-finals since that tournament. They will be hoping this is the moment some of their younger generation take the reins and propel them to back to the top table in international women’s football. One of those players who looks like she could make that difference is 23-year-old Kerolin. The North Carolina Courage forward can play across the frontline and has been on the radar of several European clubs this summer. Her 26 chance-creating carries this season is the fourth highest in the NWSL, while no player carries the ball more times per 90 (18). Geyse is another player who could be a serious threat. Having landed a summer move to Barcelona off the back of winning the Pichichi trophy for being top scorer in Liga F, she did not immediately settle in Catalonia. However, there is no doubt of her talents and she caused England a lot of problems during the Finalissima as a high-intensity presser off the ball. In that match, Brazil struggled to create opportunities, but Geyse’s movement stopped the England defence from getting comfortable, ultimately allowing them to equalise late on. Only Lucy Bronze (12) made more tackles in the attacking third for Barcelona than Geyse (11). She also gets into very effective areas in the box, with her non-penalty xG per 90 in Liga F last season (0.16) being the second highest for Barcelona. Only Asisat Oshoala (10) had more touches in the penalty area per 90 than Geyse (nine), but when comparing their carry numbers, it is clear the variety that Geyse offers. Her progressive carries per 90 were 4.1 – fewer than Caroline Graham Hansen or Mariona Caldentey, but significantly higher than Oshoala (2.7), who was ostensibly playing a similar role in the same team. This summer could be where Geyse rediscovers the form that encouraged Barcelona to sign her in the first place. This World Cup marks the first one with 32 teams, meaning the bigger teams are more spread out over groups than ever before. That makes France vs. Brazil, taking place on the second matchday in this group, one of the stand-out games of the first two weeks of the tournament. Not only is it one of two matches between ‘top ten’ teams in the group stage (the other is USA vs The Netherlands), it’s also a replay of the round-of-16 match from 2019. France came out on top that day, although they needed extra time to do so. Valérie Gauvin scored the opener before Thaisa equalised. In the end, it was Amandine Henry who scored the winner to ensure that France would make at least the quarter-finals at their home tournament. However, don’t expect this rematch to look similar: only six players from each of the sides’ current squads featured in it, and none of the goalscorers from that day will be at the 2023 tournament. Jamaica are just another one of the teams at this World Cup who have been embroiled in off-field problems. Despite qualifying for their second World Cup, the Reggae Girlz have been forced to use crowdfunders to support their trip to Australia. It was a chastening experience for Jamaica back in 2019, as they lost all three of their group games so comprehensively that an opposition player got a hat-trick in each one of them (Cristiane for Brazil, Sam Kerr for Australia, Cristiana Girelli for Italy). Bunny Shaw will be hoping she can return the favour as they face Brazil again. Shaw had an incredible season this year for Manchester City as she stepped into the limelight following Ellen White’s retirement. She finished with 20 goals and seven assists, just pipped to the golden boot by Rachel Daly. Her xG per 90 of 0.82 was the highest in the league and no player took more shots per 90 than her (5.8). Shaw is not just a goalscorer, though – she also contributes significantly to build-up. Her six multi-goal involvements (the number of goal-ending sequences in which she was both involved in the build-up and scored the goal) in the WSL this year was the highest of any player. Her 41 carries was the third highest of any Manchester City player. This ability to drop deeper might allow Shaw to dovetail well with Drew Spence. Spence is an aggressive front-foot midfielder who was previously capped for England. She likes to get into the box, with her per-90 average of 2.0 touches in the penalty area behind only Bethany England and Rosella Ayane for Tottenham, both of whom are forwards. Spence’s chance-creating actions per 90 (1.1) was the second highest for Spurs. The biggest issue Jamaica could face is being unable to get Shaw on the ball. She only had 21 penalty-box touches at the 2019 World Cup. Using players like Spence either as a decoy runner or to help support her in attack will be crucial in helping unleash one of the world’s most in-form strikers. Panama are one of the debutants at this year’s World Cup, having qualified through the inter-confederation playoffs by beating Papua New Guinea and Paraguay. Ranked 52nd in the world, they are one of the lowest-ranked teams at the tournament and will be hoping to become the first CONCACAF team since the USA to win a game at their debut World Cup. Based on qualification, Panama’s main strength will be their defence. They did not concede a single goal in the inter-confederation playoffs, making them the only team who qualified through that route to keep clean sheets all the way. However, a recent 7-0 loss to Spain in a friendly suggests that against better opposition they might not be quite so watertight.

10852,"Women’s World Cup 2023 Group E Preview: USA, Netherlands, Portugal, Vietnam","A repeat of the 2019 Women’s World Cup final beckons in Group E, with reigning champions the United States likely to go up against the Netherlands for top spot this time around. Much will be expected of both, especially the USWNT, but debutants Portugal and Vietnam are eager to prove they’re not just there to make up the numbers. With the action just around the corner, get up to speed with the major storylines and key players with out Group E preview. All eyes will be on the USA, for better or for worse. In the words of forward Alex Morgan, “We already have a target on our backs as reigning World Cup champs.” In fact, they’re back-to-back reigning World Cup ‘champs’. If they win the competition this year, they’ll be the first nation – men or women – to raise the trophy three times in a row. Victors in 1991 and 1999 as well, the USWNT have four World Cup titles under their belt, the most of any team. That’s 50% of eight Women’s FIFA World Cup tournaments. The US has never finished outside the top three at the World Cup, and as FIFA’s top-ranked team going into the tournament, that pattern could continue. The red, white and blue will more than likely advance from the group stage, even with a squad that doesn’t look much at all like the team that won the tournament in 2019. Most women’s football fans will remember Rose Lavelle’s legendary goal in the 2019 World Cup final against the Netherlands; a goal that was made up of a series of plays that would come to be known as her signature style of attack for the next four years. How she dribbled through the entire final third; how she wove fearlessly through those orange jerseys like they were mere pylons; how she beat the goalkeeper with a low, hard shot from the edge of the box. Lavelle was 24 at the time, making her big break at the 2019 World Cup, and this year’s young squad has a few players who could do the same on the world stage. Those include 22-year-old Sophia Smith, who was named both NWSL MVP and US Female Player of the Year in 2022, and 21-year-old Trinity Rodman, a key player in the Washington Spirit’s run to the 2021 NWSL championship title. In defence, there’s centre-back Naomi Girma, last year’s NWSL Rookie of the Year, Defender of the Year, and nominee for MVP. Alyssa Thompson will be one to watch as well. The 18-year-old forward will become the second-youngest player ever to represent the USWNT at a World Cup if she plays, behind Tiffany Roberts (18 years, 32 days) at the 1995 tournament. Thompson played in the USA’s final game before the tournament, hinting she might see a good chunk of time on the pitch. Forward Megan Rapinoe is coming back for one last hurrah before her retirement later this year. Still the crafty player she’s always been, she’ll play an important role coming off the bench at the World Cup as a game-changer.  She especially thrives on the big stage, having been directly involved in more goals than any other player over the last three World Cups. The USA forward has scored nine and assisted six in 17 matches. Rapinoe is currently joint fourth in the NWSL this season for assists along with USWNT teammate Morgan. Last year, Morgan won the NWSL Golden Boot, scoring 15 times, and at the 2019 World Cup, she was in peak form in front of goal. She scored five goals against Thailand in the group stage, which equalled a tournament record after Michelle Akers also scored five in a game back in 1991. Morgan and Rapinoe scored six goals each in the 2019 World Cup, tying with England’s Ellen White as top scorers. In defence, Crystal Dunn is going to be a weapon at full-back once again, having made an electric return to the pitch for Portland Thorns since coming back from maternity leave last year. Arguably the most versatile player in the USWNT squad, having Dunn back in action is a boost. Her leadership from the back will be important for what is a young defence, though there is an argument to be made that she should play in the midfield at some point as well. Head coach Vlatko Andonovski made no secret last year of the fact that the team was being built around centre-forward Catarina Macario, who this summer signed for Chelsea after finishing 2022-23 for Lyon as Division 1 Féminine’s third-highest scorer, with 13 goals. He also made it clear Mallory Pugh and Smith would be key wingers. But then his plans were thrown into disarray when Macario and Pugh were both ruled out of the tournament with injuries. The forward pool runs so deep, however, that despite changes in the frontline, their new attack will still find ways to dominate. Captain Becky Sauerbrunn recently had to give up her spot at the World Cup as well after suffering an injury. Her leadership has been instrumental to the USA’s defence in recent times. With Sauerbrunn absent, the defence is left with many young players to figure everything out themselves. Kelley O’Hara and goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher will provide some experience, but the question still remains as to who the starting centre-backs will be without Sauerbrunn. Based on recent decisions, Girma and Alana Cook could get the nod. No team at the tournament envies Vietnam. When they step onto the field for their first ever World Cup match, it will be FIFA No. 1 ranked side USA taking the other half of the pitch. No. 32 Vietnam, however, won’t go down without a fight. They come into the competition on a high from winning their fourth consecutive gold at the South East Asian Games. A 2-0 win over Myanmar to secure the 2023 title was more than enough to prove they’re a World Cup team. They qualified for the tournament by reaching the quarter-finals of the 2022 AFC Women’s Asian Cup, where they defeated both Thailand and Chinese Taipei in play-offs. It was the first time they had reached the knockout stage in their nine appearances in that competition.   Coach Mai Duc Chung hopes to bring out his and the team’s best at the 2023 World Cup. Just one goal would “make history”. Goals will likely come from Huỳnh Nhu, who is the all-time leading scorer for the national women’s team. She’s won five Vietnamese Golden Balls, including in each of the last four years. Chung also highlights midfielder Bích Thùy. The Ho Chí Minh City player scored the winning goal against Taiwan at the Asian Cup to secure Vietnam a spot at the 2023 World Cup. The team has been preparing by participating in training camps in Japan and Europe.  Nguyen Thi Tuyet Dung is known for scoring wonder goals that few other professional footballers can. Notably, she scored two goals directly from corners in the same match against Malaysia in 2015, one with each foot. Elsewhere, forward Pham Hai Yen has been a lethal attacker for the national team since 2011 and will add more firepower to the forward line. Defender Chuong Thi Kieu is not fully recovered from her knee injuries but is still attending the World Cup due to the value that her experience and familiarity with teammates bring to the squad. World Cup 2019 finalists the Netherlands have an opportunity for revenge after their heartbreak four years ago. This is, remarkably, the second major tournament since that World Cup that the USA and the Netherlands will face each other in. The Dutch came even closer to beating the US at the Olympics, drawing 2-2 in their semi-final but ultimately falling in a penalty shootout. That match was a step up from the 2019 World Cup final, in which the Netherlands were held to just eight touches and no shots inside the USA’s penalty area. It was one of five games that tournament – and third against the USA – in which one team did not take a single shot from inside the penalty area. In their 11 World Cup games, the Netherlands have only failed to score in two of them, so being limited to shots from distance was something of an achievement for the USA, and the Dutch will want to right that wrong this time around. With a few years’ experience since the 2019 final, the Netherlands will be aiming for top spot in Group E ahead of the US. The Netherlands went unbeaten in their eight games in qualifying for the World Cup and finished top of their group. Recovering from an ACL tear, Arsenal’s Vivianne Miedema won’t be on the field with her team at the 2023 World Cup. The Netherlands’ go-to goalscorer scored the most goals for her team in 2023 qualifiers (eight), and the most World Cup goals (three) in 2019. The Dutch are stacked with an army of stars coming into the World Cup. Forward Lineth Beerensteyn has been a great weapon lately, scoring four goals in the Oranje’s last four matches. Fellow forward Lieke Martens is always leaned on for her experience and finishing abilities, playing her best when she’s allowed freedom on the ball to make decisions in the moment. Most recently, the Paris Saint-Germain player has scored three goals in her last five matches for the Netherlands. Sherida Spitse is one of few European players with over 200 international caps. The midfielder was the joint-best assist-provider at the 2019 World Cup along with USA’s Sam Mewis. Each of Spitse’s assists came from set-piece situations – twice as many of any other player in that tournament. The path to this year’s tournament was no walk in the park for Portugal. The team had to show serious resilience as they ventured through the scenic route to get to their first World Cup. They originally didn’t even qualify for the 2022 Euros, though Russia got banned due to the invasion of Ukraine, and Portugal were invited to join. They then ended up qualifying for the World Cup at the Inter-Confederation play-offs in New Zealand in February. After seeing their 1-0 lead cancelled out in the 89th minute against Cameroon, Portugal were then awarded a penalty in stoppage time and Carole Costa put away the game-winning goal. The Portuguese women’s national team is starting to garner more support, including from men’s star Cristiano Ronaldo. Part of their rise comes from manager Francisco Neto’s decision to start playing against tougher opposition, as well as giving playing time during friendlies to as many players as possible.  Ranked 21 in the world, Portugal went unbeaten in their three most recent games, including a goalless draw with England at the beginning of July.  To advance from the group stage in the World Cup against opponents like the USA and the Netherlands will be no easy feat, but however far Portugal go, their presence in the tournament will have a significant impact on the growth of the game in their country. Jéssica Silva is largely considered the key player for Portugal. With 100 international caps, the former Kansas City Current and Olympique Lyonnais player is confident on the ball in one-on-one situations and deadly in front of goal. She currently plays in Portugal’s domestic league for Benfica, where she scored 17 goals in 17 games in 2022-23. Another player to keep an eye on is Silva’s Benfica teammate Francisca ‘Kika’ Nazareth, who is the youngest player to earn a cap for Portugal. The attacking midfielder started playing for Benfica at just 16 years old and has helped the club to six domestic trophies since. Across the 2022-23 campaign, she scored 26 goals in 36 appearances in all competitions at club level. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

10853,"Women’s World Cup 2023 Group D Preview: England, China, Denmark, Haiti","England have firmly established themselves among the elite of women’s international football after reaching the World Cup semi-finals four years ago and then winning the 2022 UEFA European Women’s Football Championship. The biggest prize still eludes them, however, and to correct that they’ll need to come through a group that also contains Denmark, Haiti and China. With kick-off just around the corner, read up on the key storylines and players to watch with our Group D preview. For the first time ever, England come into a major tournament with a target on their backs. The European champions have now broken down that winning barrier and enter the World Cup as one of the favourites, and with it comes the expectation rivals will approach Sarina Wiegman’s side differently than before. For Wiegman, she could reach an incredible fourth major tournament final in a row if all goes well, but there will surely be bumps in the road for an England side that doesn’t look as familiar to last summer as their coach would have hoped. Their build-up hasn’t been smooth to say the least. For the first time in the Wiegman era, last summer’s free-scoring Lionesses have failed to score for two consecutive games, following on from the Women’s Finalissima against Brazil where they won on penalties after their opponents had forced a 1-1 draw in stoppage time. A 2-0 defeat to Australia and a frustrating 0-0 draw against Portugal won’t raise too many alarms given they were merely warm-up matches, but England will need to avoid becoming too predictable in their attacking build-up should they want to follow up their Euros success with more on the global stage. Despite the talk of the Lionesses misfiring in the last couple of games, Wiegman has an embarrassment of riches available to her in attack. While last summer it was Ellen White leading the line with Alessia Russo playing the ‘super sub’ role, this year Wiegman has three leading contenders for the number nine role, with three players who scored almost 50 league goals between them last season. Aston Villa’s golden boot-winning Rachel Daly has been given the number nine shirt and started against Portugal, giving off the biggest hint yet that last summer’s left-back will be Wiegman’s preferred starting striker come the opener against Haiti in Brisbane. Russo, who recently moved from Manchester United to Arsenal, managed 10 league goals last year, fewer than half of Daly, and also fewer than Bethany England who scored 12 goals in the second half of the season as she almost single-handedly dragged Tottenham Hotspur away from the relegation zone. Daly’s 22 goals, a recording-equalling tally in Women’s Super League (WSL) history, came from just 84 shots. The only player to come close to her tally, Manchester City’s Khadija Shaw, scored 20 goals from 124 shots, with Daly’s conversion rate an impressive 23.5%. England’s was even better, with 14 goals from 40 shots, a conversion rate of 33.3%, while Russo’s rate was just 13.9% with 10 goals from 72 attempts. Daly ranked fourth in the whole of Europe for goals last season, behind only Alba Redondo (27), Racheal Kundananji (25) and Tabitha Chawinga (23), ahead of players such as Kadidiatou Diani (17), Alex Popp (16) and Asisat Oshoala (21). It’s hard to find a reason Daly shouldn’t be the starting striker for Wiegman and England this summer. Like many of the top nations, England come into this tournament with some gaps to fill. Captain and centre-back Leah Williamson is missing with an ACL injury, as is last summer’s star and top scorer Beth Mead, while Fran Kirby also remains out with a long-standing issue. Kirby is likely to be replaced by Ella Toone, her deputy last summer, while out wide Wiegman has plenty of options in Chloe Kelly, Lauren Hemp, Lauren James and Katie Robinson to make up for the loss of Mead. The absence of Williamson though is more complicated, with England missing experienced depth at the heart of defence. An extra issue is Millie Bright’s lack of football in the build-up to the tournament, but who partners her remains to be seen. Against Portugal, Wiegman opted for Jess Carter and Esme Morgan in what felt like a face-off for the spot, with Alex Greenwood remaining at left-back where she has regularly featured for England since the Euros. Greenwood was the unlucky one last summer when it came to team selection, but she is likely to play a key role this summer whatever her position. Carter and Greenwood would allow flexibility for Wiegman, with both able to play centre-back and left-back, and depending on the flow of the game could seamlessly switch positions mid-match if needed. As a centre-back at Manchester City, Greenwood has been nothing short of sublime, and could breathe new life into the Lionesses this summer. In the WSL last season, Greenwood was top of the table for passes per 90 (84.1), as well as successful passes per 90 (72.3), well clear of second-place Lotte Wubben-Moy (78.9 and 68.0). All six of the top defenders were potential options for Wiegman, with Bright, Williamson and the unselected Maya Le Tissier and Steph Houghton following closely. Greenwood also ranked highly for total progressive carries (10.2 per 90), behind only Williamson, Ona Batlle and Katrine Veje, but she played significantly more minutes than Veje or Williamson. Wherever she plays, Greenwood will be a key player for the Lionesses. If England are potentially going to be look a little different and therefore become a little less solid at the back, they may have to rely on the current best goalkeeper in the world, Manchester United’s Mary Earps. Earps has gone to new heights in recent years and her key performances last summer played a huge role in the Lionesses’ success. She is coming into the World Cup off another impressive year as number one for club and country and broke the record for clean sheets in a single league season with 14 across her 22 WSL games. Her 12 goals conceded matched her expected goals conceded tally, with a save percentage of 79.3%, better than any other goalkeeper in the league who was a regular number one. Her clean sheet percentage of 64% was well clear of her fellow England goalkeepers, with Ellie Roebuck just 29% and Hannah Hampton 33%, emphasising just how good and how important Earps has become between the sticks at any level. China are a tough team to judge heading into the 2023 tournament. The hosts of the first Women’s World Cup in 1991 were runners-up in 1999 – losing to the USA on penalties in the final – but they have never come close to getting as far again. In the 24 years that have passed since their near miss in 1999, China haven’t been past the quarter-finals, and failed to even qualify in 2011, but there is new hope under the guidance of head coach and former player Shui Qingxia. A few years ago, the Chinese Women’s Super League made a big push to sign some top players, including Zambia’s Barbra Banda and Malawi striker Tabitha Chawinga (now at Inter Milan), but COVID-19 stunted the progress of the domestic league. Only a smattering of their key players play abroad, such as Wang Shuang, probably their best player and currently at Racing Louisville in the NWSL, who also had a previous spell with Paris Saint-Germain. China are the second-highest ranked team in the group, but whether they have enough to get through is up in the air. If China are at least to make it out of the group, they will need to be solid at both ends. A solid, if at times unspectacular side, China are a possession team and the influence in attack of the aforementioned Wang Shuang will be pivotal to their hopes. During her spell at PSG a few years ago, she scored seven league goals and has two this season in the NWSL. Combined with the experienced Wang Shanshan up front, who is one of China’s most prolific scorers, their partnership could give China their best chance of progressing, while former Tottenham Hotspur forward Tang Jiali is also an option. China won the AFC Asia Cup last year for the first time in 16 years and will bring that winning mentality into the tournament, where the trio of Shuang, Shanshan and Jiali between them managed 19 goals. They beat Japan in the semi-final and South Korea in the final, two of their major Asian rivals, and China will be eager to outperform them again at the WWC. At the other end, they have conceded just once in their last five games, which will prove important against the attacking threats of England, Denmark and Haiti. Their final warm-up game against Colombia may give a better idea of the level they’re at. Supporters on UK shores may be familiar with Celtic’s Shen Mengyu, who could be an influential presence in the middle of the park for China. In the SWPL last season, Mengyu ranked within the top 10 for passes in the opposition half (786), while she also ranked third for open-play chances created (53) in the entire league – five of those assisting goals. She has the ability to tee up China’s exciting-looking attack if there is space to operate. Denmark have enough quality that England and China would probably have been disappointed to see them drawn in Group D as the top-ranked Pot 3 side. It’s a final swansong for long-standing manager Lars Søndergaard who will stand down as head coach after six years in charge after the World Cup, taking on the baton after Nils Nielsen led the side to the Euro 2017 final. Perhaps that run gave Denmark an elevated reputation around the world – one they haven’t been able to match since – but there is no reason they cannot at least give China a run for their money and progress from the group given the quality they hold, with a nice blend of youth and experience in the squad. Denmark fans will have been delighted to see captain and star player Pernille Harder return from long-term injury at the end of last season. As an extra plus point, it looked like she’d never been away, especially in the FA Cup final when she came off the bench to change the momentum of the game in Chelsea’s favour and set up the eventual winner for Australia forward Sam Kerr against Manchester United at Wembley. Harder has 70 goals for the national team where she’s played a pivotal role since her first cap. Last season, Chelsea won 10 out of 10 games Harder featured in, but just nine of the 12 she didn’t, with two losses and a draw. Harder created on average 1.8 chances every game across just 607 minutes of WSL action, while she recorded an expected assists value of 0.24 per game. For comparison, Guro Reiten had 0.38, from 800 more minutes played. Domestic players. International players. Exciting youth. Experienced heads. The Denmark squad has a bit of everything. WSL fans will be familiar with Bayern Munich-bound Harder, but also Everton’s departing defender Rikke Sevecke, her now former club teammates Katrine Veje, Karen Holmgaard and Nicoline Sørensen, as well as Arsenal’s new superstar Kathrine Kühl. There are players at an array of top clubs around the world, too. Sofie Svaa plays for Real Madrid, Signe Bruun has just joined her after spells at Lyon and PSG, while Amalie Vangsgaard joined PSG in January. There is also North Carolina Courage duo Mille Gejl and Rikke Madsen. One thing is for sure, this Denmark squad is not short on quality and if Søndegaard can get a tune out of them one last time, they are more than capable of springing a surprise. You can’t say enough about Haiti’s journey to get to their first Women’s World Cup. It’s one of the poorest nations in the world, the capital city of Port-au-Prince has been overrun by gangs and the nation was decimated just over a decade ago by one of the worst earthquakes the world has seen. Even on the football side, they have been embroiled for too long in a sexual abuse scandal that saw several high-ranking officials banned by FIFA, including then-president Yves Jean-Bart, yet against it all they have developed an incredible array of talent that guided them past Chile in a playoff and into a first World Cup. For Nicolas Delépine, who duals his role as head coach with the same role at French second-division side Grenoble, it’s the opportunity of a lifetime to go up against some of the world’s best, but there’s no reason this fearless group can’t shock some of their bigger names given the attacking talent they hold. Fifteen of the players named in Haiti’s initial extended squad for the World Cup currently play their football in France, with the others largely college students in the USA apart from Zenit striker Shwendesky Joseph. Given the shared language and cultures, getting key players into the French league was a purposefully created system by the federation some time ago and it has paid off for both the team and the individuals. Some are rising to the top, with defender Kethna Louis joining Montpellier this summer, while others are shining further up the field. Experienced forward Roselord Borgella is also starring for a top-half side in Dijon, as are Batcheba Louis and Nérilia Mondésir for Fleury 91 and Montpellier respectively. Mondésir was the seventh-highest scorer in the French top division last season with nine goals, with Louis not far behind with seven of her own. Mondésir also ranked in the top five for chances created across the season, with 29, only three off second-place midfielder Léa Le Garrec of France. There is no doubt that one player stands out in this Haiti squad. Melchie Dumornay recently joined Lyon after pretty much every major club in world football chased her services. Such have been her performances both domestically for Stade de Reims and with the national team, where she scored both goals against Chile to secure World Cup qualification, it was apt it was Dumornay who performed in the biggest moment. Still just 19, there is no doubt she is heading for the very top, and Lyon will only elevate her stardom even further. Her 11 goals saw her placed within the top five scorers in the French top flight last season, while her creative influence was even clearer, despite not playing for a Champions League chasing team. Dumornay’s six assists was only three short of Selma Bacha (nine) at the top of the tree, while no player had more ball carries that ended in a shot on goal than Dumornay’s 25 across the season. She also ranked highly for chances created, with 31, only behind Le Garrec and Gaëtane Thiney. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

10854,"Women’s World Cup 2023 Group C Preview: Spain, Japan, Zambia, Costa Rica","Group C at the 2023 Women’s World Cup contains one of the favourites, Spain. They kick off against Costa Rica on 21 July, before Zambia and Japan tussle a day later. So, what should we expect from the teams in Group C? Spain are still reeling from last year’s player revolt that saw 15 stand down from international football in an attempt to force internal changes after the UEFA Women’s Euro 2022 quarter-final defeat to England. Only three of those 15 are in the squad for the World Cup. This will be just Spain’s third appearance at the Women’s World Cup, and their previous two efforts ended in the group stage and second round respectively. While some key players have returned, including double Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas from injury, head coach Jorge Vilda may still have to contend with a fractured camp and awkward questions. But for one month he still possesses one of the most talented squads in the tournament; it just remains to be seen what he can do with them. Drawn alongside Japan, Zambia and Costa Rica, it’s a group Spain should be able to navigate, and in reality, anything less than a quarter-final would be a failure with the players available, even if the likes of Mapi León and Patri Guijarro are continuing to hold firm in their absences. The discontent within the Spain squad has been known for a while, whether it’s related to the perceived level of support from the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) or its steadfast backing of Vilda despite players raising concerns about various matters and the direction of the team. For a few years now, this generation has been considered Spain’s best. A myriad of superstars from a very successful Barcelona side have teamed up with some of the best from the likes of Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid, Levante and others, yet what do they have to show for it? It’s easy to forget they went closer than anyone to knocking the Lionesses out of Euro 2022 last summer and likely would have had it not been for Ella Toone’s late equaliser. But it was their tendency to retreat back into their shell under Vilda rather than go for the jugular which saw them throw away a lead they very much deserved for most of the game. While the likes of Aitana Bonmatí and Mariona Caldentey have returned after their stints away from the team, Vilda actually seemed to get a tune out of those relied upon in the absence of so many key names, even beating world champions United States at the end of last year. It may be looked upon as a positive that some star names have returned, but will they instantly slot back in? And what underlying tension between them and the coach/federation will still linger? If Spain click into gear, they should overcome what is a potentially tricky group. Former world champions Japan are rebuilding nicely and have an exciting team, while Zambia’s attack is also capable of causing the best teams problems. Nevertheless, Vilda will be expected to guide this team to top spot. If they do win the section, they will avoid the side of the draw that could include all of England, France and Germany. In that scenario, awaiting them would potentially be a second-round game against co-hosts New Zealand or Norway, either of whom would provide a thorough examination of Spain’s credentials. Get through that and their worst-case quarter-final would likely be Sweden. While still tough, it’d be winnable for a side with as much quality as Spain. Vilda has been heavily backed by the RFEF, though elimination before the quarter-finals would surely spell the end of this turbulent tenure. Vilda didn’t select Real Sociedad’s Amaiur Sarriegi, despite her being Spain’s top scorer during qualification with 11 goals. However, he does have Levante’s Alba Redondo. She may not have announced herself on the global scene yet, but this will be her big opportunity on the back of a stellar season at club level. Redondo was not just the top scorer in Spain last season – with 27 goals – but anywhere in Europe’s top five leagues. Her 25 non-penalty goals tied Racheal Kundananji of Zambia, who she will face in Group C. The 26-year-old Redondo proved a particularly reliable penalty-box striker, with all but two of her 27 coming inside the area. Additionally, of the 30 league games she played, Redondo found the back of the net in 19 of them, the highest percentage (63.3%) of any player in Europe’s top leagues. With an embarrassment of riches in attacking areas, there’s no guarantee Redondo will get the starting role, but her season in Spain gives her a great chance of leading the frontline at the tournament. The only concern may be how clinical she is. That might sound a little daft for someone who scored 27 goals, but those came from 137 shots, giving her a conversion rate (18%) that was lower than a lot of her fellow strikers. It’s not just in attack where Spain will be dangerous during this World Cup, because their midfield and defence are stacked with quality too. Full-back Ona Batlle has just re-joined childhood club Barcelona after a successful two-year spell in England with Manchester United, and she’s coming into the World Cup off the best season of her career. Batlle’s nine assists was the joint-second highest in the Women’s Super League (WSL) last term, and by far the best of any right-back. She also created 36 chances and was a very positive outlet on the flank, carrying the ball further than any other player, with a total carry distance of 2,581 metres. In midfield, the brilliant Bonmatí more than made up for the absence of Putellas while she was injured, taking on a starring role for both club and country in the heart of the pitch. Bonmatí ranked among the best in Europe, only behind a few of her club teammates, for successful passes into the final third last season. She was a threat in front of goal too, scoring five goals during Barcelona’s Champions League campaign, and leading the way with seven assists to top things off. As her stats show, Bonmatí was much more involved than anyone else in Barcelona’s attacking sequences last season, and a player now considered as one of the very best could well be set for a huge summer. Are Japan back? Time will tell. It could be a tournament too early for an exciting and emerging young side, but this is certainly a sleeping giant full of potential. There’s been plenty of change since their two finals in 2011 and 2015, the first of which ended in a shock World Cup triumph. But they are now looking to put a disappointing 2019 behind them under head coach Futoshi Ikeda. Some familiar faces remain, such as new Roma recruit Saki Kumagai, but the former Lyon and Bayern Munich star is the only name in this squad over the age of 30, and that’s why there is so much promise in this new-look Japan side. Japan have always been a possession-based team, and with their current midfield options, that’s quite a scary thought for their opponents. Among them are Manchester City’s Yui Hasegawa, who was named in our WSL Team of the Season, Portland Thorns sensation Hina Sugita, fellow NWSL emerging star Jun Endo, and several other WSL names such as West Ham United’s Honoka Hayashi and Liverpool’s Fuka Nagano. Hasegawa has been the standout over the past 12 months, and her efforts in the league after joining City didn’t go unnoticed. Playing in a deeper role than normal, Hasegawa excelled when it came to regaining possession, ranking in the top six for recoveries in the league last season with 159 across the campaign. But she never lost the creative influence that makes her so dangerous, holding the second highest pass completion rate for a player with over 1,000 passes attempted, at 88.6%. Also pay attention to MyNavi Sendai’s Hinata Miyazawa, who created 13 chances at last year’s Asian Cup, a tally only beaten by Hasegawa, but Miyazwa’s total was the most from open play in the tournament. You can have a good midfield, but you need top attackers to make the most of it. Ikeda just happens to have a couple of gems in his squad. Much of the focus may be on exciting 19-year-old Maika Hamano due to her high-profile move to Chelsea in January, and she will certainly be one to watch, but Riko Ueki is equally worth looking at this summer. The Tokyo Verdy Beleza forward was the top scorer in the WE-League last season, and in last year’s Asian Cup scored five goals during Japan’s run to the semi-finals, a tally only bettered by Chelsea and Australia striker Sam Kerr. Ueki is also a creative influence, laying on nine chances to teammates during last year’s tournament, ranking her in the top five. If Japan’s midfield and attack click into gear this tournament, it may be a very fruitful summer indeed for a team that could become a force again over the next few years. Having burst onto the international scene at the delayed Tokyo Olympics two years ago, Zambia are back for a crack at the World Cup for the first time, one of the eight debut nations in this year’s tournament. With an exciting attack and a bit more reason to be optimistic in defence after an exciting but porous display in Japan in 2021, Zambia look well-equipped to spring a surprise if things go their way, even with the difficult draw. After a run to third place at last year’s Africa Cup of Nations, Zambia will be hoping to showcase the progress they’ve made since Tokyo. Nevertheless, it is difficult to know what to expect from them as they go into the tournament shrouded in controversy, with head coach Bruce Mwape under investigation for alleged sexual misconduct. Two years ago, it was striker Barbra Banda who grabbed the headlines as she scored a hat-trick against the Netherlands and then followed it up with another treble in a thrilling 4-4 draw with China. Banda will still lead the line this summer, but many eyes will also be on Madrid CFF’s Kundananji, the explosive forward who was one of the top scorers in Europe last season. Her final-day brace against Barcelona to stop the Catalan giants going a second successive season unbeaten should have sufficiently whet the appetite. Kundananji scored an incredible 25 goals for a side not challenging for Champions League qualification, and none were spot-kicks, which equalled the non-penalty tally of Spain’s Redondo. She pipped fellow African strikers Tabitha Chawinga and Asisat Oshoala for goals, and all of her attacking stats were comparable to the very best. She’s also shown herself to be capable of scoring all kinds of goals. Zambia also have her Madrid CFF teammate Grace Chanda. She attempted the most shots and registered the most efforts on target over the whole Africa Cup of Nations tournament last year, certainly playing her part in that third-place finish with two goals and an assist. Between them, Chanda, Banda and Kunandanji can cause chaos for even the best teams. While Zambia were entertaining to watch two years ago, they can’t afford a repeat of the 15 goals they conceded in those three games if they are to make it out of the group stage this summer. Their recent enthralling 3-3 draw from 3-1 down against Switzerland hinted little’s changed and that we may still see two sides to Zambia depending on which half of the pitch the ball is in, but last year’s AFCON does give some reason for optimism. Zambia didn’t concede a single goal from open play in the whole tournament, with their three goals against coming from two free-kicks and a penalty. The opposition will be stronger overall on the world stage, but it hints things are moving in the right direction. A tough task awaits Costa Rica as they return to the World Cup after qualifying for the first time since 2015, and head coach Amelia Valverde has already caused a splash by leaving out experienced captain Shirley Cruz. The former Lyon and PSG star retired at the end of the season, with the World Cup teed up as her swansong, but that decision was taken out of her hands. Costa Rica find themselves in a tough group, but they have a handful of players competing in some of the world’s top leagues, while many are starring in Mexico’s emerging Liga MX Femenil. They may be the unfancied side of the group, but is there reason for cautious optimism? In terms of established names you might recognise in Valverde’s squad, most are in this area. Portland Thorns star Raquel Rodríguez is the talisman of the Costa Rican squad with 55 goals in her 100 caps, and she’s teamed with Melissa Herrera, who continues to thrive as both a goalscoring and creative midfielder for Bordeaux in France. They have additional experience in vice-captain Katherine Alvarado, with the 32-year-old sitting on 125 caps. Costa Rica have only scored three World Cup goals and she assisted two of them, both eight years ago. Alvarado also netted twice during their 2022 CONCACAF Championship campaign, which saw them qualify for this tournament. If Costa Rica are to have any success in this tournament, midfield will be crucial. A name more familiar to those in the United Kingdom will be Glasgow City’s Priscila Chinchilla. The attacking midfielder is only 21 years old but has already scored 20 goals for her country and is fast approaching her 50th cap, showing the level of talent she has at such a young age. Complementing the forward line, which includes the young and exciting María Paula Salas, Chinchilla could be one to watch this tournament, whether you’re an SWPL fan or not. Chinchilla scored 12 goals and was a constant attacking threat in Scotland last season, having 76 shots for the eventual champions. She’s more than capable of creating too, with her 42 chances set up for teammates ranking her sixth in the league. This summer could become a breakout tournament for Chinchilla, but Costa Rica will need all of their key players to step up if they are to challenge the likes of Spain and Japan in Group C.

10855,"Women’s World Cup 2023 Group B Preview: Australia, Canada, Republic of Ireland, Nigeria","With the Women’s World Cup just around the corner, look ahead to the action with our preview of Group B, which contains co-hosts Australia, Canada, the Republic of Ireland, and Nigeria.  Group B features two of the current top 10 teams in women’s football, with Canada (seventh) and co-hosts Australia (10th). Don’t rule out a dangerous Nigerian side, with one of the best strikers in world football, while the Republic of Ireland will be looking to make their mark on their World Cup debut.We look ahead to the action in Group B. A last-minute squad announcement. It was a mere day before the list was due on Monday that Canada head coach Bev Priestman finalised her decisions. That is largely because the FIFA-ranked seventh best team in the world have been overcome with injuries in recent months. The biggest question marks were midfielder Desiree Scott and forward Nichelle Prince. Scott, referred to as ‘The Destroyer’, didn’t make the cut as she is still recovering from knee surgery. Prince suffered an Achilles injury but was named in the squad. Veteran forward Janine Beckie had an operation after tearing her ACL in March and was forced to withdraw from the talent pool being considered. Defender Jade Rose had to leave the pre-tournament camp after sustaining an injury.  Even though players like Kadeisha Buchanan, Deanne Rose, Quinn, Shelina Zadorsky and Jayde Riviere were able to recover in time for camp, the near-endless slew of injuries has meant Priestman’s opportunities to experiment with lineups in friendlies ahead of the World Cup have been limited. It’s no secret that the reigning Olympic gold medalists are hungry for more. After defeating Sweden in the 2020 Olympic final after a penalty shootout, Canada are out to prove they can win a World Cup too, and that their title didn’t come down to what many consider luck. While it’s true that penalties fell in their favour – they also defeated Brazil in the quarters after a shootout – a strong defence was the main reason behind their success.  Across six games at the Olympic tournament, they conceded just four goals, while keeping clean sheets in impressive performances against Brazil and the United States. That isn’t to say Canada are incapable of making magic happen in the final third. While they’ve had their ups and downs in recent matches, they found success on the attack against Group B rivals Australia less than a year ago. One of Canada’s most relied-upon scorers, Adriana Leon, managed to net all three goals in Canada’s two wins over the space of four days against the Matildas in September 2022. She demonstrated deadly levels of versatility in those matches, from finishing a cross, to running onto a through-ball, to firing in a bullet from outside the box. The pressure will be on Canada to perform and make it out of a tricky group to reach the last 16. After all, the reigning Olympic title holders have always managed to reach the knockout stage in the following WWC tournament. Playing Nigeria in their first match of the tournament, Canada will have a reason to be confident knowing they came away with a win and draw after a two-game friendly series with the same opposition last April. They qualified for these finals with an impressive showing at the 2022 CONCACAF W Championship, in which they reached the final without conceding a goal in four matches before losing to the United States 1-0 in Mexico. It wouldn’t be right to talk about Canada without mentioning the all-time leading scorer in international football, for both men and women. Christine Sinclair, with 190 international goals to her name, is back for a sixth World Cup. Trailblazing for Canada since the early 2000s, Sinclair, along with Marta, holds the record for most Women’s World Cup tournaments with at least one goal. Sinclair is currently 10th all-time in minutes played in the Women’s World Cup (1,869), just 234 minutes behind second-place Formiga (2,103). The defending NWSL champion has started all 21 of Canada’s World Cup matches in the 21st century, playing the full 90 minutes in every game except one. Sinclair just celebrated her 40th birthday in June and could become the first player to play a game and to score a goal at the Women’s World Cup aged 40+ years. Including the men’s tournament, she could become just the second player to do so after Roger Milla for Cameroon in 1994 (42 years old). Ahead of this edition, Sinclair has scored 10 of Canada’s 34 goals at the Women’s World Cup (29.4%), which is the highest proportion of any player for their team among those with at least seven goals scored. The first order of business for the Matildas at this year’s tournament will be making sure they do not become the first host knocked out in the group stage of a FIFA Women’s World Cup. There are two mindsets to have going into this: One. Australia haven’t won an opening match in their last three World Cups. They lost 1-0 to Brazil in 2011, fell 3-1 against the United States in 2015, and lost 2-1 to Italy in 2019. Only once have the Matildas won their opening World Cup match in their eight years of playing in the tournament, beating Ghana 4-1 in 2007. Two. The 10th best nation in women’s football (according to FIFA, at least), Australia are scheduled to play this year’s opening match against World Cup debutants the Republic of Ireland in front of a sold-out home crowd of over 80,000 at Stadium Australia. How could they not win? Captain Sam Kerr told the media after the World Cup roster announcement that she could have never dreamed of playing a World Cup in Australia. Riding the high of winning 11 of their last 14 matches, home-field advantage might make them even better and help them finally make it past the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time.   When Tony Gustavsson took the role of Australia manager in 2020, he set out to establish depth in the squad in time for the World Cup three years later. To him, that meant having more than one player for each role. So, with a 4-4-2 formation in mind, Gustavsson chose a World Cup roster that includes exactly two players for each outfield position, and three goalkeepers. The former U.S. women’s national team assistant also has a goal for the XI that ends the game to be just as strong the XI that started it, if not even stronger. Australia proved their strength in that when they won the 2023 Cup of Nations in February after their players off the bench played significant roles in creating opportunities that won the tournament. It’s the need for game-changers that influenced him to bring Kyah Simon to the tournament, a decision that hasn’t gone without some questioning.  One of the big surprises on Australia’s 2023 World Cup roster was Simon. The forward hasn’t played football since October. After rupturing her ACL while playing for Tottenham, Simon has been racing the clock to be ready for her third World Cup. Despite her absence, Gustavsson has confidence in Simon. The country boasts a deep pool of attacking talent to choose from, but Simon’s chemistry with other veteran players could orchestrate games. A “game-changer” is what Gustavsson calls her. She’ll come off the bench when the team needs her guidance and expertise to boost them. According to Gustavsson, Simon was not selected for the squad based on her form right now, but rather the level they believe she can reach. The deadline to replace an injured player doesn’t come until just 24 hours before their opening game. Also on the roster is experienced defender Alanna Kennedy, who has been struggling with shoulder and calf injuries for the past nine months. With 108 caps, she hasn’t played for Australia since September. Joining Simon and Kennedy in the group after recent injuries are veterans Emily van Egmond, Tameka Yallop, Mary Fowler, and Australia’s most-capped player of all time, Clare Polkinghorne. A month ago, there was a lot of reason to worry that Australia would be left with many holes to fill in the squad. That’s not as much the case anymore as they have been training and scrimmaging with the team two to three weeks ahead of July, but with a few faded question marks still lingering on some injuries, there might be a couple of replacement call-ups still to come. One of the players to watch – not just for Australia, not just in Group B, but of the whole tournament – is Kerr. The legendary forward scored five goals in four games in the last World Cup in 2019, including a four-goal performance against Jamaica. She hasn’t slowed down with her goalscoring prowess since. Kerr has the most goals in the Women’s Super League since the beginning of January 2020, having plundered 54 goals in 67 matches. After leading the WSL in scoring for two years, she most recently ranked fourth for the 2022-23 campaign with 12 goals, helping Chelsea to their sixth league title. Chelsea have won the four straight years that Kerr has been on the team. Kerr is one of the most dangerous penalty-box players about. Not only did all 12 of her WSL goals last season come from inside the area, but she also had a higher proportion of her touches inside the box (26.1%) than any of the other 11 players to score at least eight WSL goals in 2022-23. The Matildas’ all-time leading scorer will be playing her fourth World Cup, having amassed 63 international goals in 120 appearances. In their most recent game, she notably scored the winning goal against reigning European champions England in a 2-0 victory, ending the Lionesses’ 30-match unbeaten streak. A high note to keep her and the team soaring as they look for success at home this summer.  Ranked 22nd in FIFA rankings and making their World Cup debut, some might say they need the luck of the Irish to advance past the group stage, but their recent success might suggest otherwise. The Republic of Ireland conceded only four goals in nine matches in qualifying for this World Cup, not allowing more than one goal in any game. At the other end of the pitch, they scored 27 times in those nine matches. Admittedly there is a slight caveat to their goalscoring record, in that 20 (74%) of those goals came in two games against Georgia, but you can only beat the team that’s in front of you. They won a team-record six times on their way to qualifying for the finals this summer, while their one defeat was also the fewest they’ve ever managed in a World Cup qualification campaign. A team can’t lose that easily when they’re prioritising a wall of defence with a 5-4-1 formation; they’ve stuck with that almost throughout qualification and are unlikely to change for these finals.   Captain Katie McCabe will bring both quality and experience to the Irish squad. The Arsenal star played the second most WSL minutes for the club in 2022-23 (1,675) and was integral to them winning the ball high up the pitch, winning possession a team-high 26 times in the final third. A car accident brought Sinead Farrelly’s football career to a halt in 2016. But another reason for the midfielder’s absence became public in September 2021 when she and Mana Shim accused their former Portland Thorns head coach, Paul Riley, of sexual coercion in a story by The Athletic. Riley denied the accusations but was fired by his employers at the time, North Carolina Courage, due to “very serious allegations of misconduct” and was subsequently banned from the NWSL for life in January 2023. After eight years without a competitive appearance, Farrelly returned to the NWSL in March when signing for NJ/NY Gotham FC. She got her first international cap with Ireland on 8 April and is now World Cup-bound. It promises to be an emotional moment when she takes to the field. A former manager of Scotland, the Netherlands, Russia and South Africa at international level, as well as the Houston Dash of the NWSL in 2018, Vera Pauw has been the Republic of Ireland head coach since 2019. Now she and the squad are debuting in the World Cup together. But at the beginning of July, The Athletic published allegations from Pauw’s former players who claimed she “created a culture of fear” when she was coaching Houston. Pauw denied the accusations and pointed out her Dutch background, adding: “[The players] are not used to women being direct.” Nevertheless, the controversy has followed the Republic of Ireland to this tournament and has the potential to be a major distraction. Pauw and star player McCabe talked to the media ahead of their final World Cup warm-up game, but most of the questions were about the allegations. Eventually, McCabe left the table with a sarcastic comment to the media, saying: “It’s been a pleasure talking about the World Cup, guys. I really appreciate it. Thank you.” Of the four teams in Group B, Nigeria have appeared in the most World Cup tournaments (nine – including this one). However, despite qualifying for every tournament so far, they’ve only progressed to the knockout stage twice in eight previous attempts. They’ve also won just four of their 26 matches in Women’s World Cup history. Nigeria will be hoping to turn four wins into five in their opening game against Canada on 21 July; that is, if they play… To compete on the biggest stage with the best teams in the world is already no easy task. To do it while at odds with your country’s federation? Even harder. Nigeria head coach Randy Waldrum is at loggerheads with the leadership of the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) over unpaid salaries and their players’ rights. Two weeks before the World Cup, The Equalizer reported that assistant coach Lauren Gregg hadn’t been given indication over whether she’s even going to the tournament.  Waldrum, who claims he is owed seven months’ wages, told the Sounding Off on Soccer podcast that the team was supposed to have a camp for 10 to 12 days in Nigeria before going to Australia; he accused the federation of cancelling those plans. Now, he is worried there won’t be enough time to prepare for the tournament. There have also been reports of a pay dispute with players, which gave rise to rumours of an apparent boycott of the Canada match. However, captain Onome Ebi seemed to dispel such fears on Saturday when appearing in a video posted to the team’s official Twitter account, saying: “Honestly, I’ve no idea where that story is coming from.” The player to watch in this Nigerian side is undoubtedly Asisat Oshoala, who is currently one of the best forwards in women’s football. Shortlisted for the 2023 FIFA Ballon d’Or, she has an astonishing 83 goals in 89 games at club side Barcelona. Across 2022-23, only three players in the top five European leagues scored more non-penalty goals than her (21), while she found the net in exactly half of her league appearances for Barca (14/28). A goal in this year’s World Cup could have the forward become the first African player to score in three different FIFA Women’s World Cup tournaments, after scoring at the 2015 and 2019 editions.

10856,"Women’s World Cup 2023 Group A Preview: New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, Philippines","Group A at the 2023 Women’s World Cup contains one of the two hosts, New Zealand. They will most likely battle it out with both Norway and Switzerland for a place in the knockout stages, but 2022 AFC Asian Cup semi-finalists Philippines won’t just be there to make up the numbers. We look at the four teams in Group A and assess their qualities ahead of the tournament. While women’s football has developed massively and fast over the last decade, things still need to improve. When the World Cup was given to the two nations in Oceania, New Zealand and Australia, they launched it under the phrase ‘As One’.   New Zealand doesn’t even have a domestic league for women, and the players in their squad announced for these finals all play abroad. But now they all return home to inspire a whole nation to join the women’s football movement.  “This is a chance for us to move forward with women’s football in New Zealand, and it’s an opportunity for us to do it together. I will do everything I can in the upcoming three years so that the experience people will have when visiting New Zealand for the tournament will be the best possible,” said national team captain and Angel City FC full-back Ali Riley back in 2020.  And now, here we are, ready for the World Cup 2023 to kick off. This tournament might be a month-long football party, but for the Ferns and New Zealand, it could be a time when a new history for the country can be written.  The 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup edition will be held across 10 stadiums, a tournament record. Six stadiums are in Australia, and four are in New Zealand.  New Zealand have participated in the tournament five times (1991, 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019) but are yet to get past the group stage. They are the only team to have made five or more appearances at the tournament and have yet to reach the knockout stages. Their best World Cup campaign so far came in Canada in 2015, where they gained two points from draws against the hosts and China after losing 1-0 to the Netherlands in their opening match. The 0-0 against Canada remains their only clean sheet in World Cup history. Now, New Zealand, ranked 26th in the latest FIFA rankings, have the chance to do what they have never done before – reach the knock-out stage of the World Cup. They have history on their side, with each of the previous eight editions of the Women’s World Cup seeing the hosts do so. To get past the group stage, they’ll have to do something else they’ve never previously done at a WWC – win a match. They hold an unwanted record coming into this tournament, having played the most games in the competition without winning (15). A good start would be helpful. So far, they’ve lost their opening match at all five of the World Cup tournaments that they’ve been a part of and only scored one goal across these matches.Not playing the Netherlands on matchday one is a start, having lost 1-0 to the Dutch in the opening game of the last two tournaments in 2015 and 2019, but it won’t be an easy task against the 12th best team in the world according to the FIFA rankings, Norway. They’ll need goals to get through Group A. Goalscoring is something that’s abandoned them in previous tournaments, but Melbourne City striker Hannah Wilkinson has had some success in the past. She is the only player to have scored more than once at a World Cup for New Zealand in the past, and she was the last player to score for them at the tournament in 2015 (vs. China). Whilst New Zealand got on the scoresheet at the 2019 finals, that was via an own goal. Across the last two seasons of Australian A-League Women action, only Michelle Heyman (21 in 32 games) has more goals than Wilkinson (20 in 28 games), with the New Zealand star scoring from nearly a quarter of her shots (24.1%) and averaging a goal every 122 minutes in the competition. Opposition defences will need to be wary of the threat she poses. Experience will also be key to getting them to the knockout stage, with 35-year-old captain Ali Riley and her defensive partner, Tottenham’s 33-year-old Ria Percival, having played more World Cup games than anyone else in the squad (12). The Norwegians are looking to seek revenge for years of failing to succeed on the biggest stage even though, on paper, they should have been among the teams in the latter stages. They made it to the semi-finals in four of the first five World Cup tournaments but have failed to get past the quarter-finals in the three editions since 2011. Norway are one of seven teams to have qualified for all nine FIFA Women’s World Cup tournaments, including being one of only three European nations, alongside Germany and Sweden, to play in each edition. In the first edition back in 1991 they lost 2-1 in the final against the USA before beating Germany 2–0 in 1995, their only World Cup title so far.   They have a tricky first game against co-hosts New Zealand, but Norway have won their last seven opening matches of a FIFA Women’s World Cup tournament, since the 1995 edition. The only time they lost their first game at the WWC was in the inaugural tournament in 1991 (4-0 vs. China).  With a host of talent among their ranks in attacking positions, the Norway squad contains some of the best players in club football, but they have yet to really show that talent as a group with the national team. There is a certain level of expectation for this tournament, with the squad containing the likes of Caroline Graham Hansen (Barcelona), Guro Reiten (Chelsea), Frida Leonhardsen Maanum (Arsenal) and Ada Hegerberg (Olympique Lyonnais).  In the last edition of the tournament in 2019, Hansen attempted 11 shots, with five of those on target in the last 16 match against Australia – both were the most of any player in a WWC knockout match across the last three tournaments. The Barcelona star should yet again play a huge role in leading the Norwegian attack at this tournament. She arrives at these finals having had one of the most successful seasons in her career so far, winning both the Spanish Liga F title and UEFA Women’s Champions League with Barca. There’s a strong chance she will be seen as one of the contenders for the FIFA Ballon d’Or this year following a 2022-23 campaign that saw the winger play a part in 17 goals (11 goals, six assists) in just 13 league appearances. Of players to rack up at least 500 minutes in the competition last season, nobody played a part in a non-penalty goal as frequently as she did (every 46 minutes). Frida Maanum was the most regular player for Norway during World Cup qualification, playing 813 minutes of action across 10 games – 51 minutes more than Barcelona’s Ingrid Engen. Maanum arrives at the World Cup following a brilliant season at club level with Arsenal, where she has mastered the role of an attacking midfielder brilliantly in the absence of Dutch superstar Vivianne Miedema.  The 24-year-old will play a significant role for Norway in creating chances to score while also getting into space to fire shots from range herself. Across the Women’s Super League (WSL) last season, only four players were involved in more open-play attacking moves ending in a shot than Maanum (124), and 17 more than any other player at Arsenal. She finished the 2022-23 season as Arsenal’s top scorer in the league with nine goals, while only Stina Blackstenius (70) attempted more shots than she did (62). One thing to look out for is her ability to test goalkeepers from range – no player attempted more shots from outside the box in the 2022-23 WSL than her (31), with a league-high 16 of those finding the target. Whilst Maanum was one of Norway’s most threatening players in qualification, they relied on Guro Reiten for her creativity. Across the whole squad, Reiten led the way with 42 chances created overall in the qualifiers – double that of any other Norway player. She assisted 11 goals in the WSL for Chelsea in 2022-23, a league-high, while only three players created more chances for teammates than she did (50) in the competition. Reiten’s role for Norway differs slightly to that at Chelsea under Emma Hayes. Fans should expect to see her covering a lot of ground in these finals in the number 8 role and playing box-to-box. With the attacking talent in this Norway squad, they can’t afford to leave this World Cup with yet another mediocre performance. Head coach Heege Riise has a unique opportunity to become the first woman to win the World Cup as a player and manager. She lifted the trophy when playing with Norway in 1995, also claiming the Golden Ball award that year. She will need to get the players to perform much better than they did last summer at the UEFA European Championships in England, where they exited at the group stage and suffered a demoralising 8-0 loss to the hosts in their second match. Some Norwegian players have already played under Riise, such as Reiten during her time in LSK Kvinner. Riise has started to build a foundation of national team players from the domestic league, Toppserien. Nine of the players selected for the Women’s World Cup play in the Norwegian top-flight. While no one might doubt that Norway have goalscoring abilities up front, their defence has been the most significant issue in recent years. Since Riise took charge last autumn, the performances have shown there is still work to do defensively, both as a team and for the backline. Their most impressive performance recently happened in the Tournoi de France in February when Norway played a goalless draw against the hosts.  Ironically, the star-stacked Norwegian team didn’t manage a shot on target in that clash, but they were without Hansen and Hegerberg. A tactical note from that game was national team captain and Chelsea defender Maren Mjelde acting as a number 6 in the defensive midfield in the buildup but dropping deeper as a fifth defender out of possession as a third centre-back. Time will tell if Riise has some of those tactical twists to apply in Australia and New Zealand.  This may only be their second appearance at a Women’s World Cup tournament, but should Switzerland not qualify for the knockout stage of the 2023 edition, it’ll be deemed a failure considering a kind group stage draw. Back in 2015, they were eliminated by hosts Canada in the round of 16 but will be hoping for better this time around against the hosts, with New Zealand arguably their biggest threat to progressing. After replacing Nils Nielsen as head coach after last year’s European Championship finals, Inka Grings told the media she wanted to enforce attacking football on her Swiss side rather than being defensive. Switching formation was the first major action by Grings, who favours both a 4-1-2-3 shape and the more offensive 4-3-3 on occasion. That offensive shape will surely be deployed against both the Philippines in game one, before the likely final group game showdown with New Zealand. Switzerland looked to have suffered a huge blow to their World Cup aspirations in May when their national team captain Lia Wälti suffered an ankle injury playing for Arsenal in the WSL against Everton. Luckily for the Swiss, the verdict suggested she would be sidelined for six weeks, meaning she should be able to regain fitness for the World Cup. As the Swiss player to make the most appearances in qualifying for these finals (11) alongside Barcelona’s Ana-Maria Crnogorcevic and Servette’s Coumba Sow, Wälti’s absence would have certainly been felt by the national team. Wälti was a vital player in a wounded Arsenal side last season, and the Swiss captain should lead her side into the opening game against the Philippines on 21 July. She will be crucial to Switzerland breaking up opponents’ passing sequences at this tournament – something she also excelled at for Arsenal in the WSL last season. Among all players, only Katie Zelem (113) and Japanese star Yui Hasegawa (91) won possession back from opponents in the middle third of the pitch more often than Wälti (87), with the Arsenal star averaging more on a per 90 basis (5.5) than the leading pair. She was also among the top six midfield/forward players in the competition for progressive passes (90) in 2022-23, showing her importance to advancing her side up the pitch, too. Expect more of the same at the World Cup. In their previous Women’s World Cup tournament appearance in 2015, the main Swiss goal threat came from both Ramona Bachmann and Fabienne Humm, with three goals each. All three of Humm’s goals came the 10-1 thrashing of Ecuador at those finals, where she scored a hat-trick in the space of just 247 seconds – a women’s World Cup record. Humm also scored the vital goal to get them to this World Cup, netting a goal in injury time of extra-time against Wales in a 2-1 win, after Bachmann had scored the opener for the Swiss. Surprisingly, that was only Humm’s second goal in the UEFA qualification campaign, while Bachmann had six. In truth, Switzerland would have considered themselves unlikely to have to go through the play-offs to get to these finals, with their 25-point tally was the most of any side not to top a qualification group in the UEFA region. The likeliest source of goals at these finals will arguably come via either Crnogorcevic or Sow, who both scored nine times in qualification (including the play-offs). Crnogorcevic enters the World Cup this summer off the back of a decent showing in Spain’s top flight at Barcelona in 2022-23. She contributed eight goals and six assists in 1,529 minutes of league action, with a goal involvement every 109 minutes on average. She was also among the leading chance creators at Barcelona last season, with 38 from open play – the sixth-highest total. The winger will be a key player for the Swiss in this tournament, where she could thrive in the more attacking 4-3-3 formation in the group stage. With an expanded 32 nations playing at the 2023 edition – up from 24 in 2019 – we’re seeing some sides play in their first women’s World Cup. One of those debutants are the Philippines. They won’t be at the 2023 finals just to make up the numbers though. They reached this tournament following their best ever finish at the AFC Asian Cup in 2022, where they reached the semi-finals before eventually losing 2-0 to South Korea – one stage further than Australia, who were eliminated in the quarter-finals. Only one previous team from the AFC confederation have won their opening WWC game – China in 1991. The opposition standing in their way in New Zealand on matchday one will be Switzerland. None of the Philippines squad played in Europe’s top five leagues in 2022-23, but three did play a decent number of minutes in Australia’s A-League, with Western United pair Angela Beard (932 minutes) and Jaclyn Sawicki (799) joined by Sarina Bolden of Western Sydney Wanderers (768 mins) in their 23-woman selection for this tournament. Bolden wasn’t particularly threatening in league action last season at club level, with one goal in 10 appearances across 2022-23, she was busy at the AFC Women’s Asian Cup to qualify for this tournament. Only Australia’s Sam Kerr (27) and Japan’s Riko Ueki (22) attempted more shots than she did (19) overall. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

10947,WSL Team of the Season: Opta’s 2022-23 XI,"Who makes the English WSL Team of the Season based on Opta Data? The 2022-23 WSL season came down to the final day with a nail-biting finish seeing Chelsea crowned champions for a fourth consecutive time, with a record points total and record number of wins. Manchester United came within touching distance of a first WSL title but had to settle for a debut Champions League qualification in the end. Arsenal picked up the final UWCL place, overcoming a whole host of injuries to leave Manchester City as the team missing out. Aston Villa were the season’s surprise package as they turned a ninth-place finish last year into a fifth place one this campaign, although still found themselves a way off the top four. Meanwhile, Reading’s seven–year stay in the WSL came to an end with Kelly Chambers’ team being relegated on the last day of the season as Leicester completed a remarkable turnaround which saw them pick up 16 points in the second half of the campaign. Here is the Opta data-driven team of the 2022-23 WSL season. Leicester City’s season can be split into two parts: pre and post January transfer window. The Foxes were winless before January, losing all nine games in 2022 and conceding 25 goals from an xG (expected goals) of 13.1. The threat of relegation was real and looming right above their head. New year, new me is the phrase that best describes the turnaround by Leicester. The Foxes brought in a contingent of five talented players and among them was Bayern Munich’s Janina Leitzig on loan. The result? Foxes won their first game thanks to some heroics in goal from the 24-year-old. She made six saves in that game and kept the Brighton & Hove Albion at bay. Two HUGE saves from Janina Leitzig! Got this clip on repeat 🔄#BarclaysWSL @LCFC_Women pic.twitter.com/yV0ltdBh4t These heroics became the norm for the rest of the season. The German goalkeeper produced a gargantuan performance against Manchester City in the next game, producing 15 saves from 17 shots on goal, conceding just two from an xG of 3.4 in the game. The former Hoffenheim goalkeeper went on to produce 66 saves overall, just behind West Ham United’s Mackenzie Arnold (70), with 48 of them coming from inside the box. A caveat here is the opportunity cost of being able to make a save. Leicester’s leaky defence meant opponents managed to get high volume and high-quality shots off. The Foxes faced the second most shots (140) and the fourth highest quality of shots in the league (0.26xG), and as a result, frequently required Leitzig to save their blushes. The German produced 10+ saves in three separate matches in her time at the club (vs Liverpool, Man City and Man United), featuring three times in the top seven for most saves made in a 2022-23 WSL game. Leitzig recorded an overall save percentage of 74.2% in the WSL this season while saving 70.6% of shots from inside the box, which was the third best figure in the league – including a penalty save against Arsenal. At 6-foot, Leitzig has control over balls in the air into the box. She is blessed with good reach and control over her cross collection. She recorded the best cross collection percentage among all goalkeepers in the division (11.9%) while facing 159 crosses into the penalty areas. Leitzig is comfortable with the ball at her feet, too. She recorded the fourth best long pass completion rate in the league (39.8%), picking out teammates with respectable accuracy. While her responsibilities at Leicester didn’t need her to step out of the box often, Leitzig was the perfect antidote to their defensive problems as she produced save after save and was one of the major reasons the Foxes managed to stay in the WSL. Everton are the big ‘pretenders’ in the WSL. They aim to mimic the big sides and dominate possession against their opponents and play some scintillating football produced by some shrewd signings and reinventions. The Toffees have produced an against-the-grain pick for the left-back spot in our WSL TOTS following Gabby George’s metamorphosis this season. The former central defender’s transformation into an attacking full back/wing back/winger has been a great story to follow. The 26-year-old finished the season with two goals and two assists to her name before an injury prematurely ended her season in April. She had the fourth most direct goal contributions for the Toffees this season. Despite not playing since the start of April, George has the fifth most ball touches (924) and fifth most touches in the opposition penalty area (30) for Everton this season, highlighting her importance in possession for the Merseyside club. The English defender received out wide and offered progression with her carries while taking on defenders and producing passes into the box or shots on the cutback. Only Lucy Graham (31) had more carries into the final third for Everton this season than George (22) while only Nico Sorensen (20) had more carries into the penalty area than George (14) at Everton. The right-footed left side player showcased good 1-v-1 ability in take-ons. Her right footedness allowed George to cut inside and generate a shot or a crossing opportunity. Only three players have taken more shots for Everton this season than George (19) with only four players accumulating an xG (1.5) better than hers for the Toffees. She produced an absolute peach of a goal on her 100th WSL appearance against Liverpool this season. Her seven crosses into the penalty box were the second highest at the club. while her 11 passes into the penalty box is only bettered by three players at Everton this season. George produced 13 direct shot-involvements in the competition despite playing 200 fewer minutes than full backs above her. The full back is astute defensively as well, carrying her duel abilities from her time as the central defender. She does well in physical tussles with her opponents, dominating them and winning her duels in key areas. George has been at the Merseyside club since the start of her career amassing over a century of WSL appearances so far and she is integral to Brian Sorensen’s system offering versatility and quality alike. Maya Le Tissier made waves at Brighton across the previous two seasons and a potential move for the prodigious ball-playing defender has been in the works for a while now. Manchester United were the first to react as they triggered the release clause with a year remaining on her contract. Brighton’s two-time Young POTY was on her way to don the red of Manchester. She immediately gave a glimpse of what made her one of the most well-rounded defenders in the country by scoring a brace in her first game for the Red Devils. Across 2022-23, no outfield player played more minutes for United than Le Tissier (1,958) in the WSL. The 21-year-old became an indispensable part of United’s impenetrable defence that gave up just 12 goals throughout the season. She showcased her already defensive acumen with her prescient movements and game awareness while her physical attributes and engine allowed her to dominate duels and territory. Beyond her defensive solidity, her on-ball qualities are unmissable. She was heavily involved in the build-up and progression phase for Manchester United. Her affinity and comfort on the ball can be observed by the fact that only Alex Greenwood (1,591) attempted more passes than the United centre-back (1,574). Le Tissier is consistently looking to progress the ball higher up the pitch with her passes and ball carries – only Ona Batlle (224) had more progressive carries than Le Tissier (209). A lot of these carries are relatively short in distance (5-10m long) followed by a penetrative pass into the opposition half. Only Alex Greenwood (216) and Katie Zelem (212) recorded more final third entries in the league via passes than Le Tissier (198) and no outfield player progressed the ball further forwards than the Red Devils defender (23.2m) on average with her passes. These numbers highlight her ability to advance possession into dangerous areas and she does this while maintaining a pass completion rate of 86%, sixth best in the league for players with over 1,000 passes attempted. Somewhat surprisingly, Le Tissier (four) ranks only behind Ella Toone (six) for through-balls underlining her line-breaking abilities. The former England U19 captain also possesses great range on her passes. Her long-range passing ability enables multiple routes for her to progress. No player attempted (260) or completed more long balls (143) than her in 2022-23. The youngster – often compared to Lucy Bronze due to her physical and technical attributes – cuts a steadfast figure on very capable shoulders. Le Tissier has arrived in the big leagues now and she is here to stay. The news that Rafaelle would be leaving Arsenal at the end of this season understandably came as a significant shock for many fans of the club, with the Brazilian centre-back being one of their most impressive recent bits of recruitment. Playing in her first full WSL season, Rafaelle stood out for her ability to master all areas of defending, as well as pairing up with a number of different players throughout the season. Her relationship with Leah Williamson stood out, but she also helped marshal a defence with Lotte Wubben-Moy and Jen Beattie as Arsenal became stretched with injuries. Arsenal occasionally struggled with balls into the box, with Manuela Zinsbergeronly making 11 catches and punches across the entire season, ranking her 10th of 13 goalkeepers with more than 900 minutes in the league this season. However, Rafaelle became a much-needed aerial presence for the Gunners, winning 28 aerial duels this season with a 60.9% success percentage – the third highest number for a centre-back in the WSL. Her ability on the ball is also key, with Rafaelle often looking to step out from the back with the ball – she can pass or carry. She made 5.5 passes into the final third per 90 this season, which for context, is 0.01 fewer than Arsenal midfielder Lia Walti averaged, to show how Rafaelle likes to get higher up the pitch. One of her most eye-catching abilities is the way she takes players on to move beyond them. No centre-back had more successful take ons than Rafaelle (12), five of which were in the opposition half. With Williamson likely to be unavailable for the majority of next season due to her ACL injury, losing Rafaelle was about the biggest blow Arsenal could have had as they look to find some security in their defence for 2023-24. Ona Batlle has been the best right-back in the league for several seasons now, but a slight change to her role has seen her have her highest attacking returns ever for a WSL campaign. Batlle has gone from having zero goal contributions in the 2020-21 season to finishing this year with 10 – nine of which were assists. Batlle has spoken about feeling more freedom to get higher up the pitch, which has helped her create more chances than any other defender in the league, averaging two chances from open play per 90. What is notable is that Batlle has not had specific connections with any one player but has assisted seven different United players in the WSL – two for both Alessia Russo and Lucia Garcia, with a single assist for Hannah Blundell, Ella Toone, Rachel Williams, Leah Galton and Hayley Ladd. She has also continued to be one of the league’s best players on the ball, with her 128 progressive passes (second most in WSL) and 224 progressive carries (the most in WSL). She is constantly proactive when it comes to being on the ball and pushing it up the pitch. Interestingly she has also seen her tackle and interception numbers fall. Whereas in 2020-21, she averaged 5.4 tackles and interceptions p90 and 5.1 in last season, she made only 4.1 this year. With Man Utd being the best defensive team in the league this season, conceding an expected goals allowed of only 13 across the whole year, Batlle had the security of a more robust defence to allow her to do less of the defensive work and instead on getting higher up the pitch. It clearly paid off. Batlle has been linked with a return to Barcelona this summer with her Manchester United contract expiring. Her exit from the club would be a huge blow to the Red Devils. The most impressive player in Chelsea’s WSL title win, Guro Reiten, is the latest in a long line of Chelsea attackers who have risen to the occasion over the past couple of years. With the absences of Pernille Harder and Fran Kirby for large swathes of the season, Reiten has become Chelsea provider in chief. With 11 assists, Reiten finished just one away from equalling Beth Mead’s single season record, with her four against Leicester in a single game particularly impressive. The ball she curled round three Leicester defenders into Sam Kerr’s path would have earned her assist of the season if such an award existed. Still in awe of this @Guro_Reiten assist against Leicester earlier this season. 😍#CFCW pic.twitter.com/XvTUEaeaPk Reiten’s form has been aided by Emma Hayes’ rejigged Chelsea formation where she has moved from being a left wing back as part of a 3-4-3, to a left winger in a 4-2-3-1. Reiten has finished the season with 94 crosses (fifth most) and 50 chances created (fourth most). But the shift has allowed her not to just cross into the box but get in on the scoring, too. Reiten’s nine WSL goals this season made her Chelsea’s second most prolific goalscorer, behind Kerr with 12. With seven goals in her last 10 WSL games, she has also found form at the most important moment to help secure Chelsea the title. Reiten was involved in 20 open play attacking sequences that ended in a goal, the third most in the league whilst she also created 21 secondary chances, the fourth most in the league. Her 0.33 expected assists per 90 was also the fourth most in the league and her 5.4 xG assisted was the highest for a Chelsea player. Reiten is a unique wide player – unlike many other wingers in the league she carries the ball much less than might be expected. Chloe Kelly, who leads the league in carries, carried it close to double the number of times Reiten did (305 to 167). It has long been a mark of Hayes’ sides that different players blossom with each passing season. This year it was Reiten’s turn to step into the limelight. Hasegawa’s big move to Manchester City wasn’t as surprising as her development over the course of the season. Few could have predicted how she’d excel in an unfamiliar defensive midfield role for the Sky Blues. The Japanese international, famed for her amazing line-breaking abilities and creative zest on the ball, adapted to a deeper role seamlessly while retaining her on-ball strengths. She was still involved in the shot-creation for her side, showcasing her qualities to undo defences with her vision and play some slick passing combinations in the attacking third resulting in sequences like these… That is magic from Bunny and Yui 🤯#BarclaysWSL @ManCityWomen pic.twitter.com/y2490rj50l But there is a new dimension to her attacking mischief. Operating in a deeper role, she became integral to the squad, playing the third most minutes in the league for them (1,783) only behind Khadija Shaw and Alex Greenwood. She was tasked with recovering possession, and she executed this role to a tee. Only five players have regained possession more times than Hasegawa (113) in the 2022-23 WSL while no player initiated more open-play sequences than the 26-year-old midfielder (302), highlighting her ability to recover possession and kickstart sequences for Man City. Hasegawa won the ball back in important areas for City, winning possession 29 times (joint most) in open-play sequences that led to a shot, accumulating an xG value of 3.44 (the most), highlighting her off-ball awareness and reading of attacking situations. She compensates heavily for what she lacks in physicality with her technical and tactical brilliance. She did this while maintaining the second highest pass completion rate (88.6%) among players with 1,000+ passes attempted, showcasing her composure and comfort on the ball. The Japanese international helps City play through the opposition pressure with her positioning and close control on the ball. Hasegawa is still the nimble footed wizard, showcasing her ability to thread the needle and facilitate chance creation, albeit not directly. No player was involved in more unique build-up sequences ending with a shot (75) than she was, while she ranked ninth for secondary chances created (18) picking up five pre-assists – only two players picked up more, despite being withdrawn from the final third. The former West Ham player has been hit with a software update at Man City in the new role, laying groundwork for City’s possession, facilitating play in the final third while displaying her nimble footedness in a fresh look. Playing deeper enhanced her overall skillset and cemented her status as one of the most brilliant midfielders in the game. It has been a tough season to be a player at Arsenal with injuries decimating the squad throughout the year. But Frida Maanum has continuously been a shining light as the 23-year-old has taken on increased responsibilities in the middle of the park with aplomb. With more minutes in the WSL than any other Arsenal player (1,711), her nine goals and four assists this season were crucial in helping Arsenal improbably secure Champions League football for next season. Maanum started off the season coming off the bench but her display against Lyon in the UWCL group stages was particularly eye-catching. After that, she went on to start every WSL game for the Gunners. Whilst she was initially deployed as a 10, when injuries to Kim Little and Leah Williamson happened later in the season, she was also used in a holding role or pivot for Arsenal, showing her versatility. Manager Jonas Eidevall reflected on her importance in midfield after her winning goal against Leicester, saying “she has that versatility that she starts as a six and she can come up as a 10 and of course that’s what you see when we play her as a six, she does that good, but you really see what you’re missing when you don’t play her as a 10. “She’s so good in front of that defending line, the power she has, touch, the way she engages defence, and if you don’t step against her, she shoots, so it becomes a really hard task for the defending team.” Those shots have been incredibly important for Arsenal this season as she finished their top scorer in the league. Maanum had the furthest average shot distance (19.6m) of any WSL player with more than five goals, highlighting exactly where she likes to try and score from. Her 16 shots on target from outside the box is the most for any player this season, so she is justified in her confidence to attempt from those kinds of areas of the pitch. But it is not just scoring where Maanum has been essential for Arsenal. She has been a player who does it all for them with 1.7 open play chances created per 90, the club’s highest, and 32 successful take-ons, putting her joint second in the league overall. With 124 open play shot involvements, Maanum was the fifth most involved player in the WSL. As Arsenal’s players return to full fitness it will be interesting to see where exactly Maanum ends up on the pitch but what’s clear is that she can be relied on to do whatever job is asked of her. This WSL season has been one where various left-sided wingers have shone. Kirsty Hanson’s loan to Aston Villa was so impressive she probably would have thought she could have a decent shot at going back to Manchester United and playing, if it wasn’t for how good Leah Galton was in that exact role. Galton has been historically underrated due to her decision not to play international football but has been an incredibly important player for United over the past couple of years. So much of United’s success this season was based on player availability, with 10 players playing more than 1,500 minutes. No other team had more than eight players play this tally of minutes, with champions Chelsea only seeing Magdelena Eriksson (1,579) and Sam Kerr (1,547) reach this threshold. Galton has shone – not because with 10 goals she has recorded her highest ever WSL tally, but her defensive work is outstanding as well. Protecting Hannah Blundell has been a key part of her remit with 1.6 blocks p90 and 0.9 clearances. She also won 75% of her aerials with a significant number of touches in the defensive penalty area and defensive third for a winger. In an attacking sense, what is notable is how Galton offers something United different. They had far fewer direct attacks (19) than the rest of the top four (average of 35) but when they were attacking directly Galton would be involved. She had 14 goal involvements overall – only six players had more overall, with 11 of these from open play situations. Whilst the season might not have been as successful as United would have hoped, Galton’s year on year improvement has been a strong demonstration of how much they have developed as a squad. Khadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw blossomed into her own this season and shouldered the goalscoring load for Manchester City. She finished the season as the league’s second top goalscorer (20) behind only Rachel Daly (22), narrowly missing out on the golden boot. She recorded the most direct goal involvements (27 – 20 goals and seven assists), the same total as the next two highest players combined for Man City. After being used sparsely in the previous season, Bunny was the most used player for City this season, playing 1,898 minutes in total. This change was reflected in her output as well, which went up from 12 direct goal contributions last season to 27 in the current one. The former Bordeaux striker is a high volume shot taker. She was the only WSL player to attempt over 100 shots this season (123) and averaged 5.8 shots per 90. The Jamaican international recorded the most direct shot involvements (100) where her only involvement was the shot, a whopping 33 more than the next best player. She accrued a non-penalty xG of 16 in the process, five more than any other player in the league. Shaw doesn’t just get on the end of shots but is responsible for creating them as well. Overall, she had the second highest open play shot involvement in the league (159), only behind Chloe Kelly (164), with 21 of those sequences ending in goals, a figure only bettered by Villa’s Daly (25). The 26-year-old is a bulldozing presence who can disrupt opposition lines with her carries and generate shots for herself. Only Kelly recorded more shot-ending carries than Bunny (23) in the league, with four of them ending in goals. Her physical prowess is reflected in her aerial ability as well. No player has won more aerials than the Jamaican (61), 10 more than second placed Dagný Brynjarsdóttir. She uses this to act as an outlet and a reference point in attack, holding up and linking play with her teammates. She drops deep to be involved in the build-up while retaining her goal threat. No player had more (six) multi-goal involvements in the league than Bunny, where she was involved in the build-up and scored the goal as well. She exhibited her ability to serve as an outlet linking up play with others via her layoffs – no player had more (15) than her in WSL 2022-23. Rachel Daly joined Aston Villa off the back of a successful summer with the Lionesses, going on to pick up the golden boot (22) and record the most direct goal contributions in the league (28) in her first season back after being deployed in her favoured striker role. Daly equalled Vivianne Miedema’s record for most goals scored in a single WSL season (22), while the 30-year-old had a direct hand in 62.2% of Aston Villa’s goals this season as she finished the campaign averaging over a goal per 90 and producing the best seasonal return of her career to date. Her 81 shots in 2022-23, second only to Khadija Shaw (123), had her accumulate a non-penalty xG of 10.4 (only Sam Kerr and Shaw had more). At times, it felt like everything Daly touched turned to into a goal for Villa. She was on a hot streak where she scored ~9 goals more than her xG, such heavy overperformance might not be replicated in the near future. However, Daly generates a healthy shot volume from inside the box as well. She was often the conclusion to Villa’s possession sequences. The England international had the fourth most direct shot involvements (61) where her only involvement was the shot, while she wasn’t involved in the build-up for 15 of her 19 non-penalty goals this season. Daly was facilitated by Kirsty Hanson and French playmaker Kenza Dali. The combination between these players caused a lot of problems for the opposition to deal with. Dali-to-Daly and Hanson-to-Daly were the third and fourth most effective combinations in the league, generating 17 and 15 chances respectively, throughout the season. Rachel Daly scores goals 🔥#BarclaysWSL @AVWFCOfficial pic.twitter.com/c9rk059F2I Daly’s versatility has been an asset of the national side, seamlessly slotting into the backline. Inherently, however, her instincts are true to a forward. Her double movements to lose a marker or get in front of them and the speed of execution inside the box allows her to score goals from a variety of situations. This goal against Manchester United is one of the many examples of her movements inside the box. Daly is tenacious off the ball, applying pressure and fighting for balls but now she gets to wreak havoc in front of the opposition box. The former Houston Dash forward’s homecoming tour has been a resounding success. Aston Villa finished the 2021-22 season in ninth place, scoring only 13 goals the entire year, so the turn around this season has been one of the most spectacular that the WSL has seen. Carla Ward has been highly thought of for several years, mostly thanks to the impressive way she kept Birmingham City in the top division despite barely having enough players for a squad. Yet the improvement at rivals Villa might be even more impressive than that. Villa finished in fifth place in the 2022-23 WSL with an expected goal difference p90 of +0.15. That is still a way off the xGD of the top four all of whom had an average greater than one, but still ahead of Tottenham who had the sixth best xGD of -0.3, and an improvement on last season’s -0.76. Lots of Aston Villa’s improvement could be chalked up to recruitment. Bringing in players like Kenza Dali, Lucy Staniforth and Jordan Nobbs has obviously helped raise the quality level, but Ward deserves credit for the way she has integrated them into the team. Obviously, Rachel Daly was Villa’s best player but Ward also deserves credit for coaxing her best ever goal scoring season out of her, and giving her the freedom to get into the positions required to score 22 times in a single season. It would have been easy to try and use her in a more direct way, but Villa have been much closer stylistically to the top four than they have the rest of the league. Villa averaged 3.16 passes per sequence with an average sequence time of 8.77 seconds. Whilst they were firmly mid-table when it came to open play sequences with more than 10 passes, it is clear that they are aiming to play in a more intricate way than might have been expected at the start of the season. Whilst they are not particularly a high pressing team with a PPDA of 12.9 (less than Leicester City), they scored 10 goals from high turnovers, the joint most with Chelsea and Manchester United, showing how Ward has focused her team’s energy higher up the pitch to great effect. Ward signed a new deal with Aston Villa and whilst she will have her eyes on bridging the gap to the UWCL spots, it will also be important that she does not ignore the teams around her. Tottenham have been a concerning example that finishing fifth is no guarantee of continued success, but Ward has created some strong foundations for her Villa side going forward.

10953,Barcelona vs Wolfsburg: UWCL Final Preview,"The UEFA Women’s Champions League title is the golden crown in women’s football. A title that grants the winner the bragging rights to be called the best in Europe. A title that secures your place in the pantheon of the women’s game. Wolfsburg were the first German side to successfully defend their Champions League crown after winning the title in the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons. Since then, however, the She Wolves have finished runners up three times and made a semi-final appearance on two other occasions, but the prestigious crown has evaded them. Barcelona have firmly established themselves as the perennial UWCL contenders. This is their fourth final in the last five years during which they have lost to Lyon, broken their hegemony in Europe and lost to Lyon again. In the last few seasons, they have become ruthless winning juggernauts who show no mercy on their opponents. Wolfsburg and Barcelona are familiar foes on the European stage and share some history together. The two teams have met each other at the quarter-final and the semi-final stages of the competition, with Wolfsburg having a 4-1 upper hand in head-to-head battle. The two have been at each other’s throats in the last few years trying to secure the big prize. Wolfsburg stopped Barcelona in 2020 at the semi-final stage and Barcelona returned the favour last year by denying them a final berth. Die Wölfinnen are gunning for their first title in almost a decade, and third overall, while the Blaugranas desire a place among the giants of yesteryear with their second UWCL win. The stage is set for a classic in Eindhoven on Saturday, so here, we assess what to look out for from both sides in the final. Barcelona have evolved with every passing season, adding new tools and quality to their ranks. After losing stars like Lieke Martens and Jenni Hermoso in the transfer window and Alexia Putellas to an ACL injury, they recruited well and have shown an ability to adapt. The Blaugranas added Women’s Euro 2022 winners Lucy Bronze and Keira Walsh to their ranks in the summer alongside shrewd additions of Geyse Ferreira, Salma Paralluelo and Nuria Rábano, who were recruited from within the Spanish league. This ability to adapt and reinvent to meet different demands each season without dropping in quality is a major reason they had gone 64 games without a defeat in the league over the last two seasons before that incredible run ended on the final day of the season with a 2-1 defeat to Madrid CFF. In fact, the Catalan side have won all but three of their 94 league games in the last three seasons, losing just twice, and finishing each of the last three seasons with a goal differential of over 100. Barcelona’s core is full of players in their prime footballing years, with an average age of 26.2 years. The squad is brimming with talent in every department and has a healthy mix of veterans and youngsters. Players like Putellas, Bronze and Irene Paredes are nurturing talents of the future like Vicky López, Salma Paralluelo and Clàudia Pina. The minutes distribution within the squad is healthy without an overreliance on specific individuals. No player has played more than 80% of the combined minutes in the UWCL and Liga F this season, with 14 players playing more than 40% of the minutes, highlighting the shared load. Despite the incoming signings, Barcelona largely remain true to their ethos. Jonatan Giráldez continues with a 4-3-3 formation but now has different tools to be able to interpret the same roles in a variety of ways, like the usage of asymmetrical full-backs at times. This season hasn’t been a tactical revolution at the club but has rather seen them tweak a few details to incorporate the incomings. They still push a lot of bodies forward and leave spaces in the wide areas. However, Barcelona have lacked the ability to control, allowing the game to get transitional on more than one occasion this season, but have a direct incisiveness to them now with the profile of forwards at the club. The Spanish champions are the top scoring side in the UWCL this season, with 37 goals scored, 10 more than any other side. They have recorded the third most direct attacks in the competition (18) as well. Against the ball, the Spanish side remains one of the best counter-pressing sides in the world and generates a lot of high turnovers. No side has had more pressed sequences (257) or more high turnovers (226) than Barcelona in the UWCL. The Blaugranas play with a high line to reduce the starting distances after losing the ball, with their open-play sequences starting the furthest away from their own goal (51.7m). The mechanisms of progression and chance creation have largely remained the same with different players filling up the boots in others’ absence. In the absence of Putellas, Barcelona turned to their other midfield stars to try and recreate her impact on aggregate, if not replicate it. The new midfield comprising Keira Walsh, Patri Guijarro and Aitana Bonmatí tried to compensate for the progression, control and end product that Putellas brought. Bonmatí has stepped up big time to fill the void left by Putellas. She is currently the top assist provider in the 2022-23 UWCL (six), while being Barcelona’s top goalscorer alongside Asisat Oshoala at the same time (five). The 25-year-old has the most open-play attacking sequence involvements (91) and the most open-play chances created in the competition this season, highlighting not just her ability to play the killer ball but her overall involvement in the shot-generation mechanism for Barcelona. She likes to contribute to the progression phase by dropping deep and ranks second for most progressive passes made (90) in the competition. While the rest of the trio don’t actively take part in chance creation always, they are involved in the lead up to generating a shooting opportunity. Patri (18) and Walsh (14) rank second and third respectively for most secondary chances created in the UWCL this season. The duo rank fifth and sixth for most involvements in build-up sequences that led to a shot, with 37 and 33 respectively, further highlighting their importance to the team. If sides manage to keep a lid on Barcelona’s attacking and midfield options, the Spanish sides have one more trick up their sleeve. Mapi León is arguably one of the best ball-playing centre-backs in the world. The 27-year-old is a ball progression machine and Barcelona’s primary set-piece taker. She has great control on her deliveries and venom in her strikes, making her a threat if given space and time. No player has played more passes into the final third than the Spaniard (152) or made more progressive passes (109). She loves to drive forward from the back, with no player having more progressive carries (179) than the Spaniard. Her long carries pin opponents back and gain territory, with only Dominique Janssen (60) recording more carries of 10+ metres than Mapi (55) in the 2022-23 UWCL. Mapi has the most build-up involvements that led to a shot (56) in the UWCL this season, highlighting her heavy involvement for Barcelona in possession without being the creator or player to attempt the shot. This game could probably be labelled the ‘Rolfö Derby’. The Swede switched to Barcelona from Wolfsburg after eliminating them from the UWCL semi-finals in 2020. She is in her third final in as many years but has been on the losing side every time so far. She’ll be hoping the script has a different ending this time. The Swedish international has undergone a positional change since moving. The once winger is now a marauding full-back who still threatens on the carry and has a venomous left foot to match. The former Bayern Munich player is an outlet for Barcelona on the flanks, receiving the most progressive passes (116) in the competition while offering good progression herself on the carry. Only Delphine Cascarino (36) has recorded more progressive carries (34) than Rolfö in the UWCL this season. Her carries are purposeful, often ending in the penalty area. No player has recorded more chance-creating carries than the Swede (12), while the former Wolfsburg star has made the most crosses into the penalty box (16) while also playing the third-most passes into the area (22). Wolfsburg started the season in fiery form, but they simmered down towards the end of the season, culminating in a 4-0 loss to Eintracht Frankfurt in the German Bundesliga. The She-Wolves finished their domestic season with a cup and missed out on the league title on the final matchday. Tommy Stroot’s 4-2-3-1 with a back three in build-up has brought a mixed bag of success and Wolfsburg’s attacking prowess has kept them afloat this season. Despite not keeping a clean sheet in any of their last seven games, Wolfsburg have bettered their opponents’ tallies for both (real life) goals and expected goals in all but one of those games. In fact, their opponents have managed to create more xG than they have on just two occasions this season. In attack, the side has a fairly direct approach owing to the squad build. They’ve scored just once from build-up attacks and have converted four times (the most) from their 18 direct attacks in the competition. The team has shown clear deficiencies during the build-up and progression phase with an overreliance on a certain 21-year-old Lena Oberdorf to compensate for them. An inability to play through Oberdorf has often seen them resort to long balls and fail to retain and control possession. Only Chelsea averaged more long balls (83.2) than Wolfsburg (82) in the UWCL this season, while Wolfsburg also boast the second-best success rate (61.9%) on these passes. Against the ball Wolfsburg do like to employ a high press and try to force turnovers, but have had mixed success against better sides. Against Arsenal in the semi-final, for example, they managed to grab the winning goal via a pressing sequence but their opponents played through them with ease a few times as well.  The German side have the lowest PPDA in the competition (7.7), and they have generated 158 high turnovers from their 250 pressed sequences, highlighting the intensity of their press. Wolfsburg’s squad composition is very healthy with a good chunk of the players in their peak years or about to hit peak years. The young core of Oberdorf, Sveindis Jonsdottir and Jule Brand gives the side a solid foundation to build upon for years to come while retaining the ability to peak in the short-term thanks to the group of players in their mid-20s. The squad lacks depth in defensive positions and heavily relies on a set defensive unit, with four players from their defensive line playing more than 80% of available minutes. German goalkeeper Merle Frohms and central defender Kathrin Hendrich have played over 90% of time, while veteran members of the squad like Alex Popp and Svenja Huth are still key players, playing the fifth and sixth most minutes. Ewa Pajor is currently the top goalscorer in the UEFA Women’s Champions League this season with eight goals, while she also leads the chart for direct goal contributions for Wolfsburg in all competitions this season (20 goals and eight assists). The Polish striker has enjoyed an injury-free season, playing more minutes in all competitions than any of her last five seasons. The striker’s form has mimicked Wolfsburg’s season, starting off in red-hot form but simmering down a little as the season went on. Despite that, the 26-year-old averages 0.92 goals per 90 – exactly in line with her underlying numbers of 0.93 expected goals per 90. No player has had more direct shot involvements – defined as occasions when the player’s only involvement in a sequence is them taking the shot – than Pajor (39) in the UWCL this season, highlighting how she is the one finishing the moves for Wolfsburg. The Polish captain is a menace with her pace and movement, and she often plays off the last line of defence and drifts out wide to stretch the opposition laterally. Another key aspect of Wolfsburg’s play is how important their wingers are. They have often deployed a combination of Jonsdottir, Brand and Svenja Huth on the flanks with varying degrees of success. Huth, who plays on the right, is heavily involved in Wolfsburg’s chance creation – the seven-time German champions have created 42.8% of their chances in the league from the right flank. The youthful exuberance of Jonsdottir and Brand adds another dimension to their attack. The duo are quick and excellent direct threats and are capable of driving with the ball while taking on players. Wolfsburg’s pace on the wings and up front could be key against Barcelona as the front three are all capable of stretching the opposition and being direct. With space behind the full-backs, Wolfsburg will be trying to exploit that. When things go south for Wolfsburg, they turn to Alex Popp. The experienced German finished the season as the top scorer in the Frauen Bundesliga with 16 goals. The ‘Plan B’ for Wolfsburg looks very similar to the good ol’ hoof-it-up-to-the-big-one-up-front tactic – but this does actually works at times, and she was the difference-maker in the semi-final against Arsenal through that similar strategy. Among players with more than five full 90s played in the UWCL this season, Wolfsburg have two players in the top seven for attempted crosses per 90 – Felicitas Rauch and Huth average 7.7 and 7.0 crosses per 90 respectively, with Popp being the target for the majority of them. Despite not being a tall player at just 5-foot-9, Popp is a force of nature in the air. The German veteran has won more aerial duels (37) than any other player in the UWCL with a win rate (82.7%) only bettered by a certain 6-foot-2 Wendie Renard.  This threat in the air isn’t specific to Popp – Wolfsburg, overall, have a palpable aerial presence. The Germans have the third best aerial success rate in the UWCL season (54.5%), winning 108 aerial duels. Popp is an infectious presence. Her tenacity off the ball, fighting for every single loose ball provides that extra bit of physicality in defensive situations and her aerial presence is Wolfsburg’s not-so-secret weapon. Oberdorf is the standard against which every young player in the world is measured. The 21-year-old is a fulcrum of Tommy Stroot’s tactics. Everything flows through her, from progression to defensive stability – she masks a lot of Wolfsburg’s shortcomings. The young midfielder is a monster in midfield, covering the entire field and winning her duels. A look at her defensive action map confirms her screening presence. Her physical robustness and reading of the game allow her to disrupt opposition plays. Only Erin Cuthbert (54) and Alex Popp (42) have made more tackles and interceptions combined than the German starlet (41), while Oberdorf has regained possession 46 times for Wolfsburg in the UWCL this season, which is only behind Georgia Stanway and Cuthbert (51). She wins the ball back and lays the groundwork for Wolfsburg’s direct approach. A key element in the game will be how Wolfsburg match Barcelona in midfield. The Blaugranas often aim to establish numerical superiority in the middle of the park with a box midfield which could leave Oberdorf to chase a lot of bodies alone if not provided with support. How Oberdorf takes on her responsibilities in nullifying Barca’s midfield will be decisive in which way the title goes.  All the roads have led to Eindhoven, where the lights are the brightest and the pressure highest. The stars of today and tomorrow will bask in the limelight.  When the dust settles after the final on 3 June, we will have our 2022-23 UEFA Women’s Champions League winners. Once again one of these teams will deny the other of experiencing that which they desire the most. The Opta supercomputer is heavily leaning towards Barcelona winning this UWCL final, with a 67.5% chance of success. This would see them pick up their second UWCL title in three years, sandwiched either side of the defeat in the 2021-22 final to Lyon. Wolfsburg’s chances of winning their first UEFA Women’s Champions League title since 2014 stands at just 13.5% according to the Opta supercomputer, with there being more chance (18.9%) of the game ending level and going to extra-time and potentially penalties.

11081,Women’s Finalissima 2023 Preview: England and Brazil to Do Battle at Wembley,"England and Brazil meet in the first-ever Women’s Finalissima, a one-off game pitting the reigning champions of Europe against South America’s reigning champions. The two sides will do battle in front of a sold-out Wembley Stadium. Here are the major storylines swirling around each side ahead of the clash.  England head into the first ever Finalissima in comfortable form having smoothly negotiated an Arnold Clark Cup victory in the previous international break against a selection of teams ranked 16th-19th in the world. This match against Brazil will be a sterner challenge though, with Pia Sundhange’s side set to be the highest-ranked team England have faced since they beat the USA in their last match at Wembley. With only a handful of matches to go before the Lionesses head to Australia for the World Cup, this is not just a showpiece match for England. It will represent one of the few opportunities that manager Sarina Wiegman still has to settle on her starting XI and squad. The biggest potential challenge to England’s unbeaten run under Wiegman will be the absence of Millie Bright. Bright has featured in 27 of 29 games since the Dutch coach took charge and, despite not always getting the same recognition as some of her peers, has been the lynchpin for this side. Yet a knee injury sustained in the first leg of Chelsea’s Champions League quarter-final against Lyon has left her ruled for an indeterminate amount of time, leaving England fans nervously checking their calendars as the World Cup looms large. In the short term, Wiegman will be forced to reshuffle her defence against a Brazilian team that boasts the attacking talents of Debinha and Geyse Ferreira. Bright’s aggressive defensive approach makes it hard to see an exact replacement for her. Wiegman could partner Leah Williamson and Alex Greenwood, but Greenwood has been preferred at left-back recently, and that combination would change the make-up of the defence considerably. Jess Carter has predominantly played at full-back for Chelsea this season but has shown herself proficient at playing anywhere across the back line. Of the players called up to the England squad, only Lucy Parker has made more tackles and interceptions per 90 in the WSL this season than Carter. With Parker having never been capped before, Carter would be a logical stylistic replacement for Bright. The sense that Carter has developed a cool head on the pitch will only have been reinforced by her scoring Chelsea’s winning penalty against Lyon in the UWCL quarter-final. The most immediate question Sarina Wiegman faced following the Euros was how she would replace Ellen White. England’s all-time top scorer announced her retirement in August having started every game on the way to winning the Euros. Obvious bets would suggest that Alessia Russo becomes Wiegman’s first choice, but the season Rachel Daly has had with Aston Villa will give her pause for thought. Daly is currently second in the WSL scoring charts with 13 strikes, and she is averaging a non-penalty xG of 0.42 per 90. Russo, meanwhile, is on eight and averaging a non-penalty xG of 0.40 per 90. There’s really not much between them in the underlying numbers. Russo is just slightly ahead on shots and shots on target per 90: 4.03 and 1.78 to Daly’s 3.47 and 1.25. Clearly Wiegman feels happy that she has enough cover to potentially just take two out-and-out strikers to the World Cup. She used left-winger Lauren Hemp in the number 9 role against the USA to decent effect whilst Lauren James has also been mooted as an option up front if required. Whoever starts at Wembley on Thursday will be going up against one of the most in-form defenders in the world in Rafaelle Souza. The Arsenal centre-back has been a key part of the Gunners’ exceptional recent run of form and will be a worthy opponent for whoever gets the nod out of Russo and Daly. Wiegman has consistently offered opportunities to players from outside the England set-up. Seven players have made their debuts under her, with a cap surely in line for Lucy Parker whilst players like Laura Coombs have been brought back into the fold.  Yet she is notoriously regimented when it comes to who actually plays, starting the same eleven players for every game in England’s run to the Euros win. Of the 25 players in the squad for the Finalissima, only 13 or so feel nailed on right now to be on the plane to the World Cup. Players like Katie Robinson and Jess Park (who have 21 and 20 chance-creating carries respectively in the WSL this season) will be looking to show they deserve to make their first-ever tournament squads. Equally Niamh Charles who was cut from the Euros squad at the final hurdle last year will be hoping to prove that her defensive acumen has improved – her 25 tackles won (seventh overall) is an interesting data point in opposition to the eye test that she still struggles defensively. “What is this team really capable of?” is a question that goes around Brazil all the time when it comes to global competitions. Brazil are an absolute powerhouse on the continental stage – winning eight of the nine editions of the Copa América Femenina – but it is these kind of matches that have been a step too far for Brazil, who always looks on the verge of great things but never quite get there. However, things are changing within the CBF structure. A combination of the arrival of Pia Sundhage as head coach, the strengthening of Brazil’s domestic league and the increased professionalism that goes into the development and nurturing of talent, this might be the most stable and solid Brazil squad we’ve seen for a while. It boasts a great mixture of experience and youth, even with Marta out for the Finalissima. One of the main things that ex-Sweden and USA coach Sundhage has instilled since she took over in Brazil is a sense of pragmatism. For years the team has embodied the true DNA of Brazilian football, with flair and expansive play, but that came at the cost of managing matches. There were criticisms that the team were lacking mental resilience. But now – despite an underwhelming She Believes Cup last February – Brazil have become a more stable team, securing recent results that seemed improbable a few years ago: the win against Norway 4-1 in October along with the draws against Netherlands and Spain earlier this year. These are all examples that Sundhage is moulding this team, allowing them space to express that Brazilian “jogo bonito” but always underlined with a clear objective: get the result. In fact, if the Verde Amarela can snatch the win in Wembley, they will record three consecutive wins against UEFA opposition for the first time since 2016, when they beat Italy (twice) and Russia. As you might expect though, this more pragmatic approach has been met with some criticism in Brazil. Detractors have labelled this team as “boring” and playing in a style that goes away from the roots of the team. Their 2022 Copa América win, in particular, felt like Brazil were constantly in cruise control, getting the results they wanted but without dazzling. As mentioned, Marta won’t be available for selection as she continues her rehab after suffering an ACL injury back in March 2022. Neither will Debinha. With those two absent, Brazil will be shorn of a combined 173 international goals. However, Sundhage has other options, notably Bia Zaneratto.  Bia scored three goals in the 2022 Copa América, and six more when Brazil also won four years earlier. She doesn’t only provide goals though, with her 31 open-play attacking sequence involvements at Copa America 2022 the most of any Brazil player. That shows how integral she is not only in the finishing of moves but in the build-up of them too.  If there’s anything more Brazilian than flair and confidence on the ball, then it’s a marauding, attacking full-back. Granted, the men’s team have lacked one of those for a while, but in Tamires the women’s side has one of the most attacking full-backs on the continent. The 35-year-old from Corinthians, who boasts three Copa Américas, two Copa Libertadores, four Brasileiraos, three Paulistaos and two titles in the Danish First Division, is one of the most decorated players in Brazil. She is a vastly experienced and consistent performer for her national team. Since Sundhage’s arrival, she’s played 41 games for La Canarinha and has played more minutes (3077) than anyone else. She has created 42 chances over that time, putting her third in that regard, and delivered five assists. She’s whipped in 129 crosses from open play – four times more than any other player – and her attacking stats show her importance to the build-up of the team. But it’s not only in attack that Tamires proves her worth. Since Sundhage’s appointment, she averages 2.9 tackles per game (fourth highest), 1.1 clearances (fourth highest), 2.0 interceptions (second highest) and 5.9 recoveries (second highest) amongst players in Brazil who have played 20 or more games. Averaging 31 carries per game and 6.7 passes into the attacking third, Tamires has shown time and time again to be one of the most dependent performers for Brazil. With Brazil’s first-choice goalkeeper Lorena out with injury, and in a race against the clock to be available for the World Cup, the position in between the sticks is up in the air. Camila (Santos), Leticia (Corinthians) and Luciana (Ferroviaria) have been called up but only the latter has seen minutes since Sundhage’s appointment, and only 90 minutes at that in a 4-0 win against Mexico in 2019. Elsewhere, Luana Bertocelli (Corinthians) and Andressa Alves (Roma’s second-highest goalscorer in Serie A) have returned after long absences and some young talent – like Ferroviaria’s youngster Aline Gomes – will vie for the last remaining spots as we approach the World Cup. And that’s perhaps the even bigger story at play. Not only are these two sides in competition for a trophy, something that in Brazil’s case would show they’re worthy contenders at the top of the sport, but these players are all playing for crucial squad spots ahead of Australia & New Zealand 2023.

11109,Crunch Time in the Women’s Champions League: Quarter-Final Preview,"We’ve reached the business end of the 2022-23 football season, where accolades and bragging rights are on the line. The biggest prize in women’s club football is entering its final stages, with the UEFA Women’s Champions League now down to just eight teams. Here, we preview the key stories behind each of the four quarter-final ties through the use of Opta data. Three-time UEFA Women’s Champions League finalists. The team that broke Lyon’s incredible streak of five straight European titles. The Spanish women’s football juggernaut. Barcelona. One of the favourites for the UWCL title in 2022-23. But to win, they’ll have to get past the new kids on the block, AS Roma. Roma are this year’s Cinderella story. The team has existed for just five years, but they have already risen to the top of Italian football, achieving UWCL qualification, a Coppa Italia title and an Italian Supercup win during this period. The 2022-23 season looks like it could be their best yet. Roma have already booked their place in the 2023 Coppa Italia final after defeating Milan, while they currently hold an eight-point lead over Juventus – the winners of the last five titles – in the final stages of the Serie A campaign. The team is tactically flexible and has real heart under manager Alessandro Spugna. They switch between formations seamlessly and play an exciting brand of football which is heavily reliant on their use of wide players. The majority of their chance creation comes from the flanks, with the wingers and wing-backs taking up creative and shot-taking responsibilities. Overall, 10 goals and 155 shots have been created via a pass or cross from open play from either flank this season. Their 18.7 open-play crosses per game this season is by far the most of any other side in the division. Wingers/wing-backs Emilie Haavi (0.25), Annamaria Serturini (0.24) and Benedetta Glionna (0.2) rank among the top six in the league for expected assists per 90 from open play this season, while both Haavi (13) and Glionna (nine) rank within the top six players for chance creation via ball carries in 2022-23 across Serie A. Roma are a shot-happy team, averaging 25.9 non-penalty shots per game – at least five more than anyone else in the league, while they also average a Serie A-high 2.15 non-penalty xG per game. The wide players are crucial in producing this volume as well. Serturini (5.7) and Glionna (5.6) rank first and second respectively for non-penalty shots per 90 across Serie A this season. Barcelona have been as dominant as ever domestically in 2022-23 despite the absence of two-time UEFA Women’s Player of the Year Alexia Putellas. They are well known for being technically and tactically sound in midfield and often top the football ‘aesthetic’ charts. Despite Putellas being out, they have managed to keep that style in the middle of the pitch with a midfield comprising Keira Walsh, Patri Guijarro, Aitana Bonmatí and Ingrid Engen. In the wake of Putellas’ absence and fresh arrivals, the roles in midfield have changed. Walsh has slowly established herself as a deeper midfielder while Patri is playing a slightly advanced role and Aitana has shouldered more of the offensive labour. Aitana has already scored more goals in the UWCL this season (five) than the previous campaign (four) while also recording four assists – the club leader in both metrics, while her 26 shots are second only to top scorer Ewa Pajor of VfL Wolfsburg (35) overall. Her ability to arrive late into the box has been the key behind her increased attacking end product this season. The Barcelona star is the leading player in the UWCL (58) for open-play shot sequence involvements, while she’s third across the Spanish top-flight on a per 90 basis (8.6), showing her importance in the team’s shot creation across both competitions. Of her 164 involvements over both competitions this season, 70 (43%) have come as the player on the end of the move and taking the shot. Another storyline in this game is the return of the former UWCL-winning Barcelona captain, Vicky Losada, to Camp Nou along with ex-Barcelona player, Andressa Alves. This time trying to bring down the empire they helped build. Barcelona arrive as favourites but with Roma’s wing-focused play and Barcelona’s aggressive full-backs, there is an opportunity for Roma to find joy down the flanks. If the Italians can get Manuela Giugliano to ping balls in that space quickly, they could throw a curveball to test Barcelona’s resolve. A David vs. Goliath battle with a touch of homecoming. Bad blood? Probably not. Exciting storylines? Hell yeah. Bayern Munich and Arsenal have similar stories. Both sides often find themselves second-best domestically and both have just one major trophy across the last five years. Bayern Munich’s most recent triumph came in the form of a league win in the 2020-21 season, whereas Arsenal recently ended their trophy drought with a 3-1 Conti Cup win over Chelsea earlier this month. Bayern are the only team to defeat Barcelona this season, following their 3-1 victory on MD4 of the UWCL group stage. It was an impressive win, one in which their gameplan was executed to a tee. After experimenting to find balance early on in the season, manager Alexander Strauss has settled on a 4-2-3-1 and Bayern have a rhyme and reason about them now. The midfield for both sides is stacked with talent and integral to either team’s chance creation and ball progression. The midfielders for both these teams offer incredible dynamism with line-breaking runs from midfield and incisive passing, while having a profile that can protect the backline. A talent pool consisting of Sarah Zadrazil, Lia Walti, Georgia Stanway, Kim Little, Sydney Lohmann, Frida Maanum, Katherine Kuhl and Lina Magull is salivating. Bayern summer signing Stanway has been a major part of finding balance for the Bavarian side. Stanway is the joint top scorer for Bayern in the competition in 2022-23, tied with Klara Buhl (three), while she also has a team-high three assists. She has been involved in the most open-play attacking sequences for Bayern in the UWCL this season (35), while in the Bundesliga she is the overall league leader with 90 – 12 more than any other player. She is an integral part of Bayern’s progression up the pitch, completing the most passes into the final third of the pitch across the whole Bundesliga this season (185), while also leading the metric for the club in the UWCL (85) so far in 2022-23. Not only this, but her ball-winning attributes are important to the German side, with her 23 tackles and total possession-winning actions (62) the highest of any player in the Champions League so far this season. Playing alongside Sarah Zadrazil in a double pivot, Stanway brings a whole spectrum of qualities to the table, ranging from winning the ball back, helping in ball progression and chance creation. Arsenal started hot under coach Jonas Eidevall once again but have lost momentum with long-term injuries to star players Beth Mead and Vivianne Miedema. They are currently fourth in the WSL table, five points off leaders Chelsea but with a game in hand on Manchester City and Manchester United knowing that a win would take them level with the two Manchester clubs. But recent form has been impressive. They followed up the Conti Cup win over Chelsea, with back-to-back WSL victories over Liverpool (2-0) and Reading (4-0). One player crucial in Arsenal’s attempts to win four in a row will be chief creator Frida Maanum. The Norwegian has found her footing at Arsenal this season, with the 23-year-old given the freedom in an attacking role that suits her skillset. Across the WSL and UWCL combined, Maanum has created the most chances for Arsenal overall (40) and from open play (30) this season. Her nine goals in both competitions make her their leading scorer, while she’s only attempted fewer shots across WSL and UWCL (57) than Stina Blackstenius (65) and Caitlin Foord (58) for the Gunners and only Foord (120) has been involved in more open-play attacking sequences across both competitions than Maanum (114). When Arsenal hammered Lyon 5-1 away on 19 October in the opening game of the group stage, they created a lot of noise. But since then, mainly due to injuries, they have found themselves mixing and matching pieces to find solutions to their problems – Noelle Maritz’s potential move to deputize at left-back against Bayern is an example of that. However, it’s clear that they have found some rhythm lately and will look to continue that with a positive result in the first leg away in Germany next week. They’ll have to improve their record of just one win in six UWCL meetings against German clubs, however… This match pits the all-time most successful club in the UWCL (and previous formats) – Lyon, with their eight titles and 10 final appearances – against the new pretenders of women’s European club football: Chelsea. They’ve locked horns once before, in the 2018-19 edition, where Lyon knocked out Chelsea in the semi-final, but that was a different time. Lyon went on to seal their fourth of five consecutive UWCL titles and Chelsea were just starting to build their project. Four years down the line, Chelsea are a much more dangerous proposition, while Lyon are being caught up.   Lyon have had injury issues of their own this season but the return of Selma Bacha, Ellie Carpenter, Sara Dabritz, Dzsenifer Marozsan and UWCL’s all-time top goalscorer, Ada Hegerberg, provide a huge boost for the French side. Sonia Bompastor has tweaked the system this season to accommodate the absentees due to injury and that has led to Lyon looking different than usual this term. French winger Delphine Cascarino has gone from strength to strength for Lyon. She’s currently the leading player in the French top-flight for open-play chances created per 90 (2.0) and open-play expected assists per 90 (0.29). With a change in system (4-3-1-2/4-4-2-diamond compared to 4-3-3 last season) under Sonia Bompastor, Cascarino has been a lively presence in the box. Her touches inside the penalty area have increased to 6.9 per 90 compared to 4.3 last campaign. This change of role reflects in some of her ball carry numbers as well. Her carries into the final third have reduced from 2.5 per 90 to 2.0 per 90 while there’s a marked increase in her carries entering the penalty box from 1.6 to 2.9 per 90 this season. Chelsea began the 2022-23 campaign slowly, but following a win in the title six-pointer against Manchester United last weekend, they lead the English top-flight heading into the UWCL quarter-finals. While usual suspects like Sam Kerr and Guro Reiten have continued their strong performances, youngster Lauren James – sister of Chelsea and England men’s right-back Reece – has propelled herself into the mix for Chelsea’s star of the season. James has found continuity for Chelsea this season and has been performing at her scintillating best. The English winger is a powerful ball carrier and only 12 players across the league have averaged a higher progressive carries per 90 (7.2) than her (min. 800 minutes). With that in mind, it’s surprising that she’s only created two chances from carries in the WSL across 2022-23, but there’s little doubt that her ability to beat an opponent with her pace and skill is a key attribute – no player in the WSL has beaten opposition players with a take-on as many times as James this season (23). Whilst they currently lead PSG in the Division 1 Féminine standings by a single point, Lyon are head and shoulders above all other French top-flight teams when it comes to chance creation. Their non-penalty xG average per game in the league this season is 2.66, with the next highest Paris Saint-Germain at just 1.60. They also have the best quality non-penalty shots on average (0.13 xG), but if there is any criticism, it’s that they can waste chances. Their 12% shot conversion rate is below five other French league clubs, while they have actually underperformed their non-penalty xG by 2.6 (excluding own goals). Compare this to clubs like Fleury 91 (+13.3), PSG (+9.5), Reims (+8.4) and Paris FC (+7.7) and there might be a case for Lyon to slip up if they end up being toothless rather than ruthless in front of goal over these two legs against Chelsea. Chelsea, on the other hand, have brought in new faces and even lured former Lyon central defender Kadeisha Buchanan to the club in the summer. But question marks remain if this is a star team or a just a team of stars. Occasional complaints of a lack of tactical clarity from coach Emma Hayes and an over reliance on individual brilliance to bail them out of tricky situations has been the talk among the fans. Will it be enough for them to topple the European royalty? Time will tell. Wolfsburg and Paris Saint-Germain have been there or thereabouts in the UWCL over the last decade – between 2013 and 2020, 2019 was the only final that didn’t involve either club. However, one of these giants of women’s club football will be going out at the quarter-final stage in 2022-23. Both teams are title contenders in their respective countries, with PSG just a point off Lyon in France, while Wolfsburg currently hold a two-point lead over Bayern Munich after 14 games in the German top-flight. One reason for potential success this season is that two of the best strikers currently playing in women’s football across the world are at these clubs: Ewa Pajor at Wolfsburg and Kadidiatou Diani at PSG. Pajor’s injury woes are well behind her and the Polish powerhouse is scoring goals for fun this season. She is currently the top goalscorer in the 2022-23 UWCL (seven) and the second top scorer Bundesliga (nine), but second in the German top-flight assist rankings with six. The threat she poses to opposition defences isn’t just witnessed through top-level stats like goals and assists – she also leads the league rankings for total shots (53), shots on target (22) and touches in the opposition box (118) in the German league, while she also averages the highest non-penalty xG per 90 (1.01). Her pace, off-the-ball movement and timing of runs make her a menace to deal with, but she is often the finishing touch on moves rather than being heavily involved in the build-up. Of her 69 open-play attacking sequence involvements in the Bundesliga this season, 46 of those have seen her only involvement being the shot (67%). For PSG, Diani has had to play a different role this season due to the injury to star striker Marie Antoinette-Katoto, and she hasn’t missed a beat. The French winger leads the league in both goals (17) and assists (six) while playing as the striker, which is her best goal return for PSG in a league campaign. She’s shouldered both the goalscoring and chance creation responsibilities for PSG this season, with a league-high 66 shots, the highest non-penalty xG total (10.0), while only Paris FC’s Gaëtane Thiney (4.3) has a higher expected assists total in the French league than she has (3.4). Wolfsburg’s 2-1 defeat to Hoffenheim on 4 March was their first defeat of the 2022-23 campaign, although they did recover with a strong 4-1 win at Bayer Leverkusen last weekend. Between now and the PSG game, they face Turbine Potsdam in the Bundesliga on Friday night, but will be expected to defeat opponents that are rooted to the bottom of the league on one point from 13 games. PSG showed that they have frailties in the UWCL group stage, losing both meetings with Chelsea without scoring a single goal, while also drawing at Real Madrid on MD2, again without scoring a goal. A decisive factor in this game will be the match-up between the defensive line and the attacks for both teams. The defensive lines lack pace for both sides, which could prove detrimental when coming up against players like Kadi Diani, Ewa Pajor, Jule Brand and Sveindis Jonsdottir.

11123,Battle at Kingsmeadow: Which of Chelsea or Man Utd Will Take a Step Closer to the WSL Crown?,"Manchester United head to Kingsmeadow on Sunday one point clear at the top of the WSL table. With eight matches of the season left, they are beginning to get tantalisingly close to what would be a historic league win. Yet Chelsea are no fools and, with a game in hand on United, surely remain favourites to add this season’s title to their collection. A win in south-west London for the Reds could change all of that. Not only would it put United definitively clear in first place, but it would also mean that they had taken points off all three of Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea this season. Chelsea come into the match under some pressure, having been comprehensively beaten by Arsenal in Sunday’s Continental Cup final. It was only the second game the Blues have lost in 2022-23 and ended an unbeaten run of 21 games that had stretched back to their very first WSL match where they had a surprising loss to newly promoted Liverpool. Manchester United meanwhile seem to have recovered from the slight slump in form they faced prior to the most recent international break. Comprehensive wins over Durham in the FA Cup and Leicester City in the WSL have demonstrated a renewed goalscoring verve, but Chelsea will obviously be a much sterner test. Earlier this season, Chelsea inflicted Manchester United’s only defeat, running out as 3-1 winners in a cagey match. Chelsea struggled to create good chances until Sophie Ingle was gifted the ball by Millie Turner allowing Sam Kerr to open the scoring. Kerr then turned creator as Lauren James made it 2-0 against her old club. Despite Alessia Russo pulling one back for United, Erin Cuthbert sealed the deal right at the death. The Manchester United error which led to the first Chelsea goal was reminiscent of an unwelcome theme. They regularly seem to be forced into unnecessary errors against Chelsea, with last season’s 6-1 loss at Leigh Sports Village a case in point. Chelsea are a side who tend to inspire panic. Despite having the highest passes allow per defensive action of the top four and ranking only seventh in the league when it comes to high turnovers, they have benefited from three errors leading to shots this season. That puts them joint highest in the league with Manchester City. Emma Hayes’ side have also scored four goals following a high turnover this season, which is the second-highest mark by a side in the league. They don’t always press, but when they do it is highly efficient. One area where United will need to be particularly wary is on their left-hand side. As can be seen on the map above, they have a tendency to be dispossessed in exactly the area where Lauren James is at her most effective. James’ defensive actions map below shows just how high up the pitch she disrupts the opponent out of possession. James’ signature move recently has been to pick up the ball on her right-hand side and drive centrally, often with devastating effect. With 21 successful take-ons, the most in the league, once James gets going, it is hard to get her to stop. United will want to be extra wary of losing the ball in her vicinity.  One of the most fascinating matchups in the game will be between the two players with the most assists in the WSL this season. Chelsea winger Guro Reiten has nine whilst Manchester United full-back Ona Batlle has seven. Over the past few seasons, Batlle has established herself as one of the most creative full-backs in the league. Her expected assists per 90 rate of 0.34 this season is more than double the full-back in second place (Aston Villa’s Sarah Mayling with 0.15). In fact, only three players (Reiten, Lauren Hemp and Chloe Kelly) average a higher open-play xA per 90 than Batlle. It is no surprise that 41% of United’s attacks come down the right-hand side she plays on. She’s more than capable performing the defensive side of her duties too. Her combined tackle and interception rate of 4.2 per 90 is the second highest of any player in the United team. Despite her all-round ability though, she does tend to get pinned back by better teams with Batlle yet to get assists against any of Chelsea, Arsenal or Manchester City in three seasons in the league. And the Spaniard will likely want to be particularly wary of Chelsea’s Reiten who is having her best ever season in a Blues shirt. Reiten leads the league with 0.39 xA per 90 and is creating 2.2 chances from open play per 90. With nine assists in total from just shy of 900 minutes played, the Norwegian is basically creating a goal a game. Both her and Sam Kerr like to exploit the space in behind defences meaning that if Batlle does end up getting caught upfield, Chelsea will likely look to quickly play the ball into the vacated space for either runner. Whoever comes out on top between Reiten or Batlle might hold the keys to the overall match. Manchester United have never beaten Chelsea (D1 L7) and there would be no better time for them to start than now. To do so, they will have to try and usurp Chelsea’s unbeaten home record which stretches all the way back to a loss to Brighton in February 2021. Manchester United are defensively the best side in the Women’s Super League both in terms of expected goals against and goals conceded. They are still yet to concede a goal from a set piece, and their goalkeeper Mary Earps was recently named the best in the world at the Best FIFA Football Awards. Among goalkeepers with more than 900 minutes played, only Ellie Roebuck is facing fewer shots on target per 90 minutes. Manchester United’s excellent defensive performances on top of Earps being in strong form makes the Reds exceptionally hard to break down. Yet Chelsea have scored three or more goals in each of their last four meetings. The Blues have scored in every single match they’ve played this season. Sam Kerr might be lagging in the race for the Golden Boot but ever since the turn of the year, she has not stopped scoring. Kerr now has 13 goals in her last 11 appearances for club and country, and Manchester United are one of her favourite teams to play against. She’s been involved in eight goals in her five WSL appearances against Manchester United (6 goals, 2 assists), scoring and assisting in the Blues’ 3-1 win in the reverse fixture. So if United are to get something out of this match, you’d think it likely they’ll also have to score. Fortunately for them, Chelsea seem allergic to clean sheets right now. They have only kept four in the WSL this season, putting them joint fifth in the league with West Ham. And for all Kerr’s fine form, United’s Alessia Russo is also ticking along quite nicely. Russo scored Manchester United’s first ever WSL hat-trick at the weekend. She has eight goals in 12 league games this season, just one fewer than she managed in 22 appearances last term. When comparing her shot maps across this season and last, we can see how she has refined her shooting. Her xG per shot has increased from 0.08 to 0.10 and she is also shooting from closer to goal – her average shot distance has decreased from 15.7m to 13.7m. She already has three goals from inside the six-yard box in comparison to only one last year. Recent history plus the form of both teams would suggest this game has the potential to be quite a high scoring one, despite United’s defensive organisation. That might play into United’s hands with Chelsea quickly falling apart against Arsenal in the Continental Cup final after they went 2-1 down For United, the key will be not to give Chelsea any of the freebies they have handed out in past meetings, whilst Chelsea will want to avoid giving United any time to grow into the game. Manchester United like to make fast starts – they have scored more goals in the first 15 minutes of matches than any other side this season – and have yet to concede a single goal in the first half of a game. A draw would probably suit both sides but a win for either one would surely make the victor the definitive favourite for the league.

11204,Five Stories We’re Glued to as the WSL Returns,"The Women’s Super League returns this weekend following its long winter break. We are not technically halfway through the season just yet, but it’s still a useful place to take stock of how the season is shaping up. Chelsea and Arsenal are the slight leaders, having only lost one match each, whilst Manchester United and Manchester City will both still see themselves as in the mix even though the draw they played out in December did neither of them a favour. Arguably the biggest surprise this season have been Aston Villa, who have pushed their expected goal difference per 90 from -0.74 last season to +0.11 this. Their offensive output has increased from 0.60 expected goals per 90 to an impressive 1.25 expected goals per 90, placing them alongside Champions League contenders Manchester United. In the middle of the pack, it seems likely that Liverpool will pick up more points in the second half of the season than they did in the first, whilst West Ham’s league position is perhaps slightly deceptive right now. There is a blockbuster fixture to help kick off the 2023 matches as Arsenal host Chelsea at The Emirates. It is probably still too early to call this one a title decider but with both sides having only lost one match each so far this year, neither team will want to give up early ground to the other. Right now, there feels like little to separate the two sides, although Chelsea may want to point to the fact that they won both their matches against the “top 4”, beating Manchester City and Manchester United, whilst Arsenal have lost their only one so far, a 3-2 defeat to United at the Emirates. Arsenal’s headline issues this season have been around injuries, with Leah Williamson and Rafaelle Souza, Arsenal’s first-choice defenders, both missing large amounts of the season. Vivianne Miedema and Beth Mead have both suffered anterior cruciate ligament injuries, making it extremely unlikely they will appear again for Arsenal in 2022-23. That’s obviously a huge blow for Arsenal, giving how involved the pair have both been in Arsenal’s attacking output: With the absence of Mead and Miedema, Stina Blackstenius will be expected to step. It would be an overstatement to say that the Swedish forward has disappointed since her arrival – she has managed four goals from an xG of three in the WSL this season – but the pressure will surely increase as we head into the second half of the season. It is clear that Arsenal could do with getting Blackstenius more involved in the area. She often looks to receive the ball in central areas, but actually some of her best moments this season have come when she has found herself in different areas of the pitch. The number of touches Blackstenius makes in the box is quite low compared to other potent attackers around the league. It might be the case that if she is going to continue to look to play more around the edge of the area, Arsenal need to do more to encourage their other attackers to get into the box. Her average shot distance this season is 14.6m, almost two metres further out than both Sam Kerr and Bunny Shaw who average 12.8m. Blackstenius’ underlying numbers are not bad at all, but she just needs to be increasing her shooting volume. One interesting facet of this will be how Arsenal’s attacking play changes without Miedema. She seemed to finally be finding her feet as a No. 10 before she got injured, and leads the WSL in terms of progressive passes played per 90 minutes (players with over 300 minutes played). Frida Maanum has been incredibly impactful, particularly with goal contributions, but it will be interesting to see whether Jonas Eidevall turns to new Dutch signing Victoria Pelova to deputise for Miedema. Pelova’s profile in terms of passing is a lot more similar to Miedema’s, but Maanum’s desire to get into the box might make her a better fit with Blackstenius. New @ArsenalWFC signing Victoria Pelova has the highest open play expected assists total in the Vrouwen Eredivisie in 2022-23, both overall (4.7) and per 90 minutes (0.71). https://t.co/Oc3WMVtilw pic.twitter.com/Amiwvdmqwd Chelsea have been dealing with their own attacking concerns, namely involving Sam Kerr’s lack of goals. Kerr is a victim of her own success (and potentially Bunny Shaw’s success) here. She has scored 10 goals in 16 matches, and her xG per 90 is almost identical to last season (0.68 in 2021-22 compared to 0.62 in 2022-23). The real drop off actually takes place when you look back to 2020-21 where she was putting up a whopping 1.03 xG per 90. That was the season where the infamous ‘Kerr-by’ partnership struck fear into the heart of all WSL defences, but her outperformance of her xG last year meant her actual production was similar. There’s no doubting the fact that Kerr is more potent with Fran Kirby playing with her. Since the start of last season, Kerr and Kirby have both played in 17 of Chelsea’s WSL fixtures. In those matches, Kerr has averaged 0.73 non-penalty xG per 90 minutes.In the 13 matches over that period when Kerr has played but Kirby hasn’t played a part, the Australian striker has averaged 0.57 non-penalty xG per 90 – a drop of 0.16 xG/90 without Kirby than when she has also played. Something that has changed over the past couple of seasons is where Kerr is shooting from. She’s only taken four shots from inside the six-yard box so far this season. This might be a result of where she is looking to receive the ball, as she now averages two more touches per 90 in the middle third of the pitch compared to last season. Chelsea’s overall non-penalty expected goals numbers have declined slightly since last season from 1.96 to 1.70 but broadly, there is little reason to be concerned. Only Bunny Shaw has a higher open play xG per 90 than Kerr, so whilst she might not be playing at the best she ever has, she is still playing very well. Her impressive left foot finish from outside the area against Paris Saint-Germain in Chelsea’s final game before Christmas showed that a striker who can win the Golden Boot on three different continents does not suddenly forget how to score. One key area to be aware of for Sunday is Chelsea’s right-hand side. It is one of Chelsea’s key attacking areas of control, where they frequently overwhelm their opponents. Emma Hayes has used a variety of players out wide with Lauren James, Fran Kirby and Johanna Rytting Kaneryd all being used in the right-wing position. It is Lauren James who has caught the eye the most with her 11 dribbles completed this season more than double any other Chelsea player, and she is averaging 15 carries per 90, the second-most on Chelsea’s squad. These are long, bounding carries too as James’ average distance per carry of 13.3m is further than any other Chelsea player. Yet it is not only her on-ball ability that makes her stand-out; she has shown she can also put in the defensive work required. Erin Cuthbert is the only player outside of the defensive line to have made more tackles than her. The main criticism of James right now is that she does tend to still drift in and out of games. Our attacking contribution ranking of James (non-penalty shots plus open-play chances created) only puts her in the 77th percentile. However, the flashes she does show are truly exceptional. If she can bring the level that she’s shown in glimpses on a more consistent basis in the second half of the season, Chelsea will have an extra prong of attacking threat. Tottenham have made the splashiest entry into the January transfer window, signing Beth England for a WSL record fee. Rehanne Skinner’s side certainly need fire power. For a team who supposedly had one eye on the Champions League, having the third lowest expected goals of any team in the league is not a great look. In fact, outside of one rather spectacular 8-0 win over Brighton, they have only managed to score three goals this season. There is no doubt that Beth England is a fantastic goal scorer. Even with limited minutes at Chelsea in recent seasons, she has continued to score regularly, with 16 goals in just over 23 full 90s in the last two and half seasons.   But do Tottenham need a goal scorer right now? The signing of Nikola Karczewska in the summer was supposed to be a solution here, with the young Polish striker having scored 10 goals in 21 appearances for Fleury last season. Yet she has struggled for consistent minutes, playing more than 45 minutes in a match only once. Her touch map shows a player who seemingly does not have a clear understanding of where she is supposed to be playing. When she has actually got on the pitch, her numbers have been pretty good. A 0.55 xG per 90 minutes is off a tiny sample size but puts her at fourth in the league. Beth England has managed 0.56 in almost identical minutes. But Tottenham’s bigger problem is not who is shooting, but where they are shooting from. Their average shot distance of 19.8m is the second furthest in the league (only Leicester shoot from a greater distance), and their xG/shot of 0.08 is the third worst in the league. Simply put Tottenham seem to either struggle to progress the ball into dangerous areas or shoot way too early rather than choosing to try and progress the ball further. Maybe there is some outcome bias to this tactic – they have scored four of their ten goals this season from outside the box – but it is clearly not an approach that is going to bring them long term success. Fortunately, Beth England might also be able to help with this problem. She is not just a goalscorer but a player who has shown in her time at Chelsea that she is also more than capable of creating for her team-mates. Her all-round technical ability means she is a strong passer whilst her hold up play and aerial ability has in the past seen her set the ball for team-mates to hit from the edge of the area – perfect for a side like Tottenham with a penchant for long-range efforts. It will be interesting to see if Skinner considers pairing Karczewska and England up front. The second striker role is one England has been familiar with from playing with Sam Kerr fairly regularly at Chelsea, although often in those scenarios it would be Kerr who drifted out wide. England’s presence within the team will certainly be a big boost but they will have to find ways to get her the ball. Sometimes when your luck is out, it is really out, and that has certainly been the case for Brighton this season. Brighton are second worst defensive team in the league according to expected goals allowed, but while the ‘worst’ team on this metric, West Ham, have conceded 18 goals off of 17.9 expected, Brighton have conceded an astonishing 29 from 17.7 xG against. The previously reliable Megan Walsh has struggled so far this season, whilst the defence has looked disorganised, switching between a back four and five. According to our expected goals on target model, Walsh has conceded almost nine more goals than she “should” have so far this season, which unsurprisingly is the most of any goalkeeper in the league. It felt like the right time for Hope Powell to move on from the club and her replacement, Jens Scheuer, feels like quite the coup for the Seagulls, having previously won the Frauen Bundesliga with Bayern Munich. Scheuer was known at Bayern for focusing on stretching play out wide, and he certainly has the players to do that with Katie Robinson having been one of the outstanding performers in the first half of the season. But it is not Brighton’s attack that Scheuer will need to solve. The recruitment of defenders Guro Bergsvand from Brann and Zoe Morse from the Chicago Red Stars shows a commitment to refreshing a defence that too often looked exhausted in the first half of the season. Teams average more shots and more shots on target against Brighton than any other side so restricting opponents’ opportunities will be the most important thing on Scheuer’s agenda. Whilst the defence has been noticeably bad, Brighton also struggle to impose control in midfield, with opponents gaining the majority of touches in those areas. This has led to Brighton defenders tending to step out from the back line, causing disorganisation and leaving gaps for opposition players to exploit. The reality is that with Leicester rooted to the bottom of the league, Scheuer will have the opportunity in the second half of the season to try and implement his style of play, without risk of relegation. The recruitment of both manager and players shows ambition from Brighton, but there is certainly a lot of work to be done. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our newsletter to receive five stories each Friday.

11205,All to Play For: Analysing Europe’s Top Women’s Leagues,"We’ve waved goodbye to 2022 and welcomed 2023 with a fresh start. Domestic leagues across Europe, well for large parts, have reached the midway point. The 2022-23 season is entering its second and final phase as we all gear up for the return of footballing action across the women’s game. There have been multiple interesting storylines throughout the season from AS Roma’s continuous rise in the domestic and European circuit to Potsdam fading away into obscurity. There’s variance and substance behind every team’s performance so far in the season. There have been storylines for individual players too, from Pajor powering Wolfsburg to Alba Redondo cementing her case for Spain’s striker position. There’s been chaos, vibes and everything in between, and it’s not over yet. In a game of football, generally, one team has a lion’s share of the possession. Some teams make it part of their identity to play a certain way, such as Barcelona Femeni. Some teams like to work the ball up the field with slow and intricate passing while some choose the shortest path between the two goals aka the direct route. Understanding how a team likes to use the ball and progress higher up the field could help us gauge the team better. Using Opta’s passes per sequence and direct speed upfield metrics could help in doing exactly that.  It is to nobody’s surprise that most of the “big clubs” across Europe’s major leagues have adopted a possession-based style and try to patiently work the ball in order to assert control over proceedings. Barcelona, PSG, Bayern Munich alongside WSL’s top four (Man City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Man Utd) all average a higher number of passes per sequence while having the lowest direct speed upfield compared to their peers. Everton, a team aiming to have a seat at the big-team table, are trying to adopt a similar playstyle. Their recruitment is geared with this idea but they have struggled to assert themselves in games in order to dominate proceedings. There are teams who like to get upfield as quickly as possible. It could be a stylistic choice as is the case with AC Milan, who have recorded the fourth most direct attacks in Serie A so far (17) and have the second fastest direct speed upfield (1.83 m/s) or it could be driven as a mechanism to limit damage when playing against sides of higher technical quality. And then there are teams which adopt the best of both worlds and are flexible depending on the needs of the game. Wolfsburg and Roma are teams that are capable of doing the slow and patient build-up while also being capable of hurting teams on the break. Both the teams rank among the top 2 sides in their respective leagues for both build-up and direct attacks. Let’s look at some of these teams in a little more detail. AS Roma’s continued rise since their inception in the Serie A has been a story to follow. The club has already won two trophies (Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italia) in Italy after acquiring the Serie A license of Res Roma in 2018. Their performances in the UWCL this season have grabbed the attention of fans around the globe and this season they have their sights on the big one, the Serie A title. Le Giallorosse have recorded the highest xG in the league (17.7). With Valentina Giacinti leading the line and having attacking support from Annamaria Serturini, Emile Haavi and others, Roma have been a very shot-happy team. Their tally of 225 shots in the league is 55 more than any other team in the women’s Serie A.  It’s not just their attacking numbers that have looked good, but their defensive metrics have been a major part of their success as well. With just 4.04 open-play xG conceded so far, which is in line with their four goals conceded, they have one of the best defensive records across Europe. They are also one of the most intense pressing sides across Europe, with a PPDA of 7.8) and manage to create many turnovers high up the pitch allowing them to catch teams in a disorganized state and generate shots from it. Their tally of 46 shots from high turnovers are the highest in the Serie A. An understated aspect of their season so far has been the squad composition and minutes distribution while juggling multiple competitions. The squad is full of players that are in the peak years of their career and Alessandro Spugna has done a brilliant job of utilizing his squad. A total of 16 players have played more than 40% of the available league minutes so far. While Roma is on an upward trajectory, things have taken a downward turn for the giants in Turin. Juventus’s underlying metrics have declined as compared to last season. Their npxG per 90 of 1.88 is lower from 2.07 from the previous season. Their defensive numbers have gotten worse as well, their non-penalty xGA per 90 of 0.88 in the 2022-23 season is higher than 0.67 from the 2021-22 season.  With the second highest average age among all teams in the Serie A this season, there might be a change around the corner in Italy. Turbine Potsdam is a team with a rich history, having been home to multiple superstar players before the modern stars reached their stardom status. The likes of Ada Hergerberg, Svenja Huth, Sarah Zadrazil and Lia Walti all have played for Potsdam before moving on to different clubs. But things are not so shiny now. After narrowly missing out on UEFA Women’s Champions League spots in the 2021-22 season, Potsdam are currently at the bottom of the table with only one point on board from 10 games. They have managed just five goals while conceding 28 in that timeframe and have the worst goal differential in the league. Last season’s downturn could be attributed to the long-term injury to star striker, Selina Cerci. This season, however, Potsdam are a depleted side. They have conceded the highest xG from open-play in the league (17.5) and second highest xG from set-pieces (4.4) this season. Things are bleak in attack as well. They have managed to record just 48 shots in the league so far, accumulating the second lowest xG from open-play in the league (4.1) while underperforming on that as well. Relegation looms on the horizon for a once giant club. There have also been teams who are punching above their weights and are doing so in their own style. They have caught the eye, producing some positive results along the way so far and maintaining a good position on the table. Liverpool’s promotion to the WSL was one of the stories to look forward to in the 2022-23 season. Their opening day win against defending champions Chelsea made an even bigger statement. While both the goals in their 2-1 win came from the penalty spot, there was an interesting thing to note in the sequence leading up to the goals. The first penalty was earned following the chaos caused by a long throw-in into the Chelsea box. With Megan Campbell in their squad, Liverpool brought long throw-ins back in fashion. They have looked to create good chances from set-play and are capable of bamboozling their opponents with a long throw into the box. Their 2.9 xG from set-pieces is only behind Arsenal and Chelsea in the WSL this season. Although this hasn’t directly resulted in a goal so far, having the ability to create something out of nothing can help them land a decisive blow in terms of the result. Fiorentina and Fleury currently sit in third and fifth position in their respective leagues, which in Fiorentina’s case is a big uptick from their seventh-place finish last season. Both of these teams have adopted a different approach to punch above their weights. While teams focus a lot on possession, it’s not the only way teams can experience success. Some teams are comfortable in conceding possession and maintaining a defensively solid shape while remaining capable of hurting teams on the break and being efficient in doing so.  In France, Fleury has been doing stuff along these lines. They have recorded the second most number of shots in the French league (140) accumulating the fourth highest xG in the league (9.9) only behind Lyon, PSG and Paris FC and they are doing so while recording 46.5% average possession so far in the season.  We can use our zones of control viz to understand what areas of the pitch they concede ‘control’ in to better understand their approach. Les Essonniennes are comfortable in conceding the ball and maintaining defensive solidity, while remaining capable of stitching up quick attacks after regaining possession high up the pitch. They have recorded 17 direct attacks in the D1 Arkema so far, which is second highest in the league. Their 4.9 xG conceded is the third lowest figure in the league so far. Their ability to generate high turnovers is a big asset that makes them a threat.  Fleury have regained possession within 40m of the opposition goal 154 times so far, which is fourth best in the league. They are very effective from these situations as well, generating 21 shots while scoring three goals (most in the league). In Italy, Fiorentina has found success doing so. Their approach to generate quick breaks in behind and be clinical in putting them away has been a story of their season. Their underlying numbers are in line with their position on the table. Their 22 direct attacks are the third highest behind Roma and Inter Milan and their direct upfield speed of 1.7 m/s is also the third fastest in the league. Their attack is largely shouldered by the duo of veteran Spanish star, Vero Bouquete and 25-year-old Hungarian striker, Zsanett Kaján. The pairing are at the heart of everything Fiorentina do in attack. Vero is capable of pulling the strings from an attacking midfield position and Kajan does well to provide a presence in the attacking third while being capable of creating chances too. The Hungarian striker has scored three non-penalty goals and assisted another three, leading the chart in both departments. Levante have arguably been the second best side in Spain (only the second place is up for grabs with Barcelona in the league) not only in terms of league position, but also raw numbers and underlying metrics. Their goal tally (42), non-penalty xG (30.3) and total shot volume (233), all put them firmly behind just Barcelona in Spain in terms of raw volume and per 90 data. Their expected goal differential of 18.7 is second to Barcelona again. J.L. Sanchez Vera’s 4-3-1-2 with Natasa Andonova playing at the tip of the midfield and doing the selfless work to aid the exploits of Alba Redondo and Mayra Ramirez has been extremely successful. The Redondo-Ramirez duo has been incisive in the way they attack the channels and Vera has provided a platform to maximize that. Redondo has scored 13 goals so far this season while assisting another five, leading the charts for both at Levante. The trio of Andonova, Ramirez and Redondo have scored 25 of Levante’s 42 goals between them. Their exploits while having one of the youngest squads in the league and not much depth from the bench is worth pointing out going into the second half of the season. Team playing styles are one aspect of the game, the execution of an idea and play-style is dependent on the players comprising the team. It’s worthwhile and interesting to look at the top performing players through the lens of various playstyle metrics like goalscoring, chance creation and ball progression. Scoring goals is integral to a team’s chances of being able to win games and goalscorers are arguably the most talked about players on a football team. They get all the hype and for large parts it’s deserved as well. By looking at the goalscoring aspect of the game we highlight some of the best performing players of the season so far in this section. In WSL, Man City’s Khadija Shaw has managed to lead the charge for City and show her true powers in the process. The Jamaican striker is currently the joint-top goalscorer in the WSL with eight goals and has the highest direct shot-involvement in the league (34). It’s not just her goalscoring with which she adds value, her powerful line-breaking carries and physically robust nature while performing the action makes her a threat from various situations. Alba Redondo has made a very strong case for the striker position in the Spanish national side. She is posting a healthy shot-volume of 5.06 shots per 90 and has the highest direct shot involvement in the league (96) while her team-mate and partner in crime, Mayra Ramirez, is not far behind on (61). The timing of her runs and initial acceleration make her an incredible threat in behind, Inter Milan’s Tabitha Chawinga has taken the Serie A by storm. Her tally of nine goals and four assists are the highest in Serie A and means she has played a direct hand in 13 of Inter’s 28 goals this season. Her excellent threat in behind is one of her key strengths. In France, PSG’s Kadidiatou Diani and Paris FC’s Mathilde Bourdieu have been ruling the league. Both players rank inside the top three for their shot-volume and their open-play chance creation rate, underlining their ability to score and create for their teams. Diani has shouldered the offensive burden for PSG, filling in the striker position. Bourdieu has been averaging more than a goal per 90 so far in the season and has been a key figure for Paris FC’s campaign so far. Following two injury laden seasons, Ewa Pajor’s brilliance was at the risk of getting lost in time, but she has taken care of that this season and in some blistering fashion. Pajor has been other-worldly good this season. Her numbers are above and beyond any other player across all major European leagues. Her 15 goals in 14 league and Champions League games so far are the best return of any player within the top five women’s leagues across Europe in 2022-23. The 25-year-old striker is averaging a ridiculous 7.2 shots per 90 while also generating 1.6 chances from open-play for her teammates, highest average direct attacking contribution across Europe. Pajor’s shotmap suggests a strong presence and also highlights how she is able to get shots from very good areas. Her speed, timing of the runs and ability to play quick lay-offs allow her to get in behind quickly and produce some very good combination play around the midfield area as well. She drifts out wide to provide parity and help create chances for her team. The ability to progress the ball from the defence has increasingly become a desirable trait among defenders. They are tasked with providing the foundation for a team’s build-up alongside being defensively astute. While the numbers here are often biased towards high possession sides, it’s worth looking at players who are key in helping their team play out from the back. Lyon’s Wendie Renard, Barcelona’s Mapi Leon and Man City’s Alex Greenwood have all been key parts of their side’s build-up play. All three of these players are blessed with exquisite range in their distribution making them capable of launching a direct attack from their own third. Everton’s Katrine Veje and Roma’s Elena Linari are two other players whose qualities on the ball are real standouts for their teams. Veje has recorded the most number of 10+ meter long carries (54) and ranks second for progressive carries (96) in the WSL this season. Real Sociedad’s defensive trio of Manuela Vanegas, Alejandra Bernabe and Ana Tejada all show up well in their ability to move the ball upfield. The trio fill up three of the top four spots for most progressive carries in the league while Vanegas also ranks in the top six for progressive passes in Spain with 62. While the veterans and usual suspects show up well on the scatter plot, it is worth highlighting the hidden gems and the young guns who will best fit the billing in the near future. Manchester City’s summer recruit Laia Aleixandri has been able to impose her quality on the ball for City. The Manchester Blues are a side geared towards slow and patient build-up and Laia’s qualities on the ball perfectly align with that philosophy. She is equally adept at carrying and passing the ball from defence. Her 49 progressive passes and 81 progressive carries this season ranks her second and fourth in the respective categories across the league. Bayern Munich and Iceland’s Glódís Viggósdóttir has been solid overall for the Bavarians at the heart of the defence, covering space and helping bring the ball out of defence with her carries and passing alike. Viggosdottir is integral to Bayern’s buildup, no other player in the Bundesliga has the more open-play build up involvements than the Icelandic defender (575). Her eight goal build up involvements are only second to team-mate Georgia Stanway (nine) is another testament to her heavy involvement in the buildup phases for Bayern. She is extremely proficient with her carries as well. No player has recorded more progressive carries than the 27-year-old (145) and her carries are always geared towards moving the ball upfield. Summer signing, Maya Le Tissier, has quickly become a key part of United this season. The young centre-back possesses one of the most well rounded skill sets both on and off the ball. She is excellent at bringing the ball out from defence with her carries. No player has recorded more progressive carries than the English defender (101). She also leads the chart for 5-10 metre progressive carries in the WSL. We have looked at the metrics concerning attack and defence but everybody likes a player capable of producing moments of genuine technical excellence, demonstrating close control and skills on the ball. They can grab attention and adoration of fans and embarrass defenders while producing moments of genuine quality. These players might not always be ‘effective’, but they all got that ‘dawg’ in them. Benedetta Glionna has been an asset for Roma this season with her carries. Her ability to not just progress the ball but also take-on and create chances with it in the final third. She is averaging the highest number of ball carries with a take-on across Europe’s major leagues while also leading the charts for carries ending with a chance created (nine) in Serie A this season, despite playing 520 minutes. Elena Julve is the type of player that will always have you at the edge of your seat and watch her with your eyes glued to the screen. She has recorded the highest number of carries with a take-on (42) in the Spanish league so far while also recording the fifth most progressive carries (93) in the league. She is a livewire on the ball despite lacking the final product in most cases. Mayra Ramirez has been a pillar for Levante this season. The Colombian international has recorded the second highest number of carries with take-ons in the league so far this season (35). Her balance and close control on the ball along with her lower centre of gravity makes it very difficult to dispossess her while carrying. Bayern Munich and Germany’s Klara Buhl has been one of the most impactful young players in the world. She is capable of wreaking havoc with her pace and explosiveness to dismark herself and then generate shooting opportunities or create chances for her team-mates. The break is over and 2022-23 is halfway done. We are now entering the business end of the season; the part where teams chase glory and try to avoid relegation. Teams will be looking forward to unwrapping their Christmas presents in the hopes of an improved second phase of the season. We’ve looked at the story so far but what are some storylines to follow in the second half of the season? We’ll be keeping you up to date with the key data stories through the remainder of the season. Buckle up and enjoy the ride.

11211,Die Frauen-Bundesliga in voller Datentiefe,"Seit Beginn der Saison 2022/23 erfasst Opta die deutsche Frauen-Bundesliga live und in voller Datentiefe. Durch die detaillierte Erfassung ist es uns möglich, tiefgehende Analysen zu allen Spielerinnen und Teams zu liefern, ob als Vorbericht, live während des Spiels oder im Nachgang einer Partie. Opta produziert die interessantesten Insights und erzählt dadurch die besten Stories, die für die Berichterstattung einen klaren qualitativen Mehrwert bieten. Ehe die Saison im Februar wieder losgeht, haben wir nach nun 10 gespielten Partien einen Adlerblick auf die Statistiken dieser Saison geworfen und die spannendsten Zahlen, Fakten und Grafiken zu den Teams und Spielerinnen herausgearbeitet. Die Frauen des VfL Wolfsburg sind amtierende Meisterinnen der Bundesliga, in der Vorsaison hatten die Wölfinnen am Saisonende 59 der möglichen 66 Punkte gesammelt und sich somit um vier Punkte vom FC Bayern München abgehoben. Dass der Hunger der Wölfinnen um Erfolgstrainer Tommy Stroot nicht gestillt ist, lässt sich mit einem simplen Blick auf die Tabelle ablesen: Wolfsburg prangt mit der Maximalausbeute von 30 Punkten aus 10 Spielen an der Spitze – ein perfekter Start nach den ersten 10 Saisonpartien war in der eingleisigen Bundesliga zuvor nur fünf Teams gelungen, darunter auch Wolfsburg selbst vor vier Jahren. Und, wenig verwunderlich, holten sich alle bisherigen fünf Mannschaften am Ende auch den Meistertitel. Ein wichtiger Faktor für den Erfolg der Wölfinnen ist die starke Offensive. In den 10 Partien erzielte der VfL 35 Tore und damit ligaweit die meisten, das entspricht einem Schnitt von 3.5 Treffern pro Spiel. Zudem gab Wolfsburg die meisten Torschüsse ab (212) und hat die beste Chancenverwertung (21%). Auffällig ist, dass der VfL all seine 35 Treffer (inkl. eines Eigentores) aus relativ zentralen Strafraumpositionen erzielte, was ein Indiz dafür ist, dass die Wölfinnen ihre Abschlüsse großteils aus aussichtsreichen Positionen abgaben. Dies lässt sich statistisch belegen, denn Wolfsburg nahm 82% seiner Abschlüsse innerhalb des Sechzehners und überbietet damit alle anderen Bundesliga-Klubs. Auch was die Chancenqualität betrifft, ist Wolfsburg das Nonplusultra der Liga, der Expected-Goals-Wert (xG) liegt bei 28.2, kein anderes Team knackte hier die Marke von 20 xG: Am meisten aus ihren Chancen machten jedoch die Freiburgerinnen – der SCF schoss über sieben Tore mehr als anhand des xG-Modells zu erwarten gewesen sind (25 Tore bei 17.9 xG), das ist Ligaspitze vor Wolfsburg (+6.8). Die Frauen des FC Bayern München sind mit 25 Punkten die ersten Verfolgerinnen des VfL Wolfsburg, die einzige Niederlage der Münchnerinnen setzte es im Duell mit dem VfL am 5. Spieltag (1-2 in Wolfsburg). Trotz des Abstands hat der FCB weiterhin Möglichkeiten auf den Titelgewinn – das direkte Duell mit Wolfsburg in der Rückserie findet in München statt, und vor heimischer Kulisse gewann der FCB saisonübergreifend 12 Ligaspiele in Serie. Zwar stellt das Team von Trainer Alexander Straus nach Wolfsburg (35 Tore) mit 26 Treffern die zweitbeste Offensive der Bundesliga, doch die eigentliche Stärke des FCB ist die Defensive. In 10 Saisonspielen wurde die 21-jährige Torhüterin Maria Luisa Grohs lediglich dreimal überwunden, in acht Partien stand sogar die Null – das ist jeweils Ligabestwert unter den Stammtorhüterinnen. Mannschaftsbezogen stellen diese Statistiken jedoch keinen Rekord in der eingleisigen Bundesliga dar, diesen teilen sich die Münchnerinnen selbst mit den Wolfsburgerinnen – der FCB wurde 2020/21 in den ersten 10 Saisonspielen nur einmal bezwungen, ebenso Wolfsburg in der Spielzeit 2014/15. Folgende Grafik zeigt die Abschlüsse der Gegnerinnen des FC Bayern in dieser Bundesliga-Saison.Bayerns 79 gegnerische Schüsse sind geteilter Ligabestwert (zusammen mit Wolfsburg). Kumuliert ließen die FCB-Damen nur fünf Expected-Goals-Against zu, auch das ist Ligaspitze. Hauptverantwortlich für die vielen Weißen Westen ist Maria Luisa Grohs, die 82% der gegnerischen Schüsse parierte – auch hier prangt eine Münchnerin an der ersten Stelle des Stammtorhüterinnen-Rankings. Die drei Teams, die aktuell die Plätze eins bis drei in der Tabelle belegen, sind auch die Teams, die in dieser Saison am meisten Pässe pro Partie spielten, ihre Spiele also oft mit Ballbesitz dominierten. Der FC Bayern führt dieses Ranking an (575 Pässe pro Spiel), gefolgt von Wolfsburg (519) und Frankfurt (491). An letzter Stelle in diesem Ranking liegt Werder Bremen mit durchschnittlich 305 Zuspielversuchen, dafür bewegen die Bremerinnen den Ball im Spielaufbau am schnellsten nach vorne, was die folgende Grafik schön unterstreicht: Eintracht Frankfurt überzeugte in dieser Bundesliga-Saison offensiv vor allem durch Hohe Ballgewinne und Vertikalangriffe. Die Adlerträgerinnen eroberten den Ball 139-mal innerhalb von 40 Metern vor dem gegnerischen Tor, ligaweit gelang das lediglich Wolfsburg öfter (180-mal). Die SGE münzte betreffende Ballgewinne in 25 Schüsse und diese wiederum in drei Tore um. Nur die Wölfinnen sowie der FCB kamen auf diesem Weg öfter zum Abschluss (je 28-mal), außerdem gelangen keinem Team mehr als vier Treffer nach Hohen Ballgewinnen. Zudem netzte kein anderer Klub in dieser Bundesliga-Spielzeit bislang so oft nach Vertikalangriffen wie die Eintracht (dreimal). Auch relativ betrachtet schloss keine Mannschaft Vertikalangriffe so häufig erfolgreich ab wie Frankfurt, das im Schnitt jeden fünften derartigen Angriff mit einem Tor belohnte. 46 Meter vor dem eigenen Tor starteten die Frankfurterinnen im Schnitt ihre Spielzüge, noch weiter vorne nur der VfL Wolfsburg (49). SC Freiburgs Janina Minge und VfL Wolfsburgs Ewa Pajor führen die Torschützinnenliste dieser Saison mit je acht Treffern an. Direkt dahinter lauern Alexandra Popp (Wolfsburg) und Lea Schüller (Bayern) mit sechs Toren. Dabei sind bei Minge anhand des Expected-Goals-Modells lediglich 3.3 Tore zu erwarten gewesen. Doch die 23-jährige Mittelfeldspielerin verwertete effizient wie ligaweit niemand sonst. Die Diskrepanz zwischen xG und erzielten Toren ist in dieser Saison bei keiner Bundesliga-Spielerin so hoch wie bei Minge (4.7). Dass sie einige Chancen mit einer eher niedrigen Torwahrscheinlichkeit verwertete, untermauern ihre drei Fernschusstore (geteilter Ligabestwert). Pajor und Popp sind zwar aus der zweiten Reihe nicht so abschlussstark wie Minge, beide erzielten all ihre Saisontreffer aus dem Strafraum, dafür haben sie aber Lufthoheit. Ihre je drei Kopfballtore sind Ligaspitze. Schüller traf in dieser Bundesliga-Saison im Schnitt alle 100 Minuten (601 Minuten Einsatzzeit, 6 Tore). Von allen Spielerinnen mit mindestens 250 gespielten Minuten übertrifft sie dabei nur Pajor, die durchschnittlich alle 64 Minuten knipste (510 Minuten, 8 Tore). Auf die vier besten Torschützinnen folgen fünf Spielerinnen mit je fünf Saisontoren. Eine davon ist TSG Hoffenheims Katharina Naschenweng, die wie Minge dreimal per Fernschuss traf, einmal sogar per direkt verwandeltem Eckstoß (2. Spieltag gegen Wolfsburg). Die 25-jährige österreichische Nationalspielerin benötigte für ihre Saisontreffer lediglich 11 Schüsse, 2.2 Schüsse pro Tor sind Ligabestwert aller Spielerinnen (6 Abschlüsse vorausgesetzt). Keine Spielerin hat in der laufenden Bundesliga-Saison solch einen starken Einfluss ins Offensivspiel wie FC Bayerns Georgia Stanway. Auf den ersten Blick mag diese Aussage zwar verwundern, denn die Mittelfeld-Allrounderin war lediglich an zwei der 26 Saisontore der Münchnerinnen direkt involviert (ein Tor, ein Assist), doch ligaweit war keine Akteurin aus dem Spiel heraus an so vielen Schüssen (63) beteiligt wie Stanway (entweder als Schussnehmerin, als Schussvorbereiterin oder als Beteiligte in einem Spielzug, der in einem Schuss mündete). 11 dieser 63 Beteiligungen mündeten in einem Tor, womit die 23-jährige englische Nationalspielerin einen weiteren starken Wert aufstellte (ligaweit sind nur Bayerns Linda Dallmann mit 13 und Sarah Zadrazil mit 12 noch besser). Mit Zufall oder Glück hat ihr großer offensiver Einfluss wahrlich nichts zu tun, was durch den xG-Wert von 9.1 bei Angriffs-Spielzügen mit Beteiligung Stanways (Ligahöchstwert für eine einzelne Spielerin) untermauert wird. Linda Dallmann verlängerte ihren Vertrag beim FC Bayern im Dezember bis 2026. Die Verlängerung war ein logisches Resultat der starken Leistungen der Mittelfeldspielerin. In neun Einsätzen in dieser Ligasaison war sie an neun Toren direkt beteiligt (5 Tore, 4 Assists) – das ist Bestwert beim FC Bayern und wird ligaweit nur von Wolfsburgs Ewa Pajor (12 – 8 Tore, 4 Assists) überboten. 9 – Linda #Dallmann war in neun Saisonspielen in #DieLiga an neun Toren direkt beteiligt (5 Tore, 4 Assists) – das ist Bestwert bei den @FCBfrauen und wird ligaweit nur von Ewa #Pajor (12 – 8 Tore, 4 Assists) überboten. Langfristig. https://t.co/0MsClr3zIL Doch Dallmann zeigt auch, dass sie den Ball über mehrere Meter in Richtung des gegnerischen Tors führen kann und im Anschluss oftmals noch diesen einen Geniestreich besitzt, um selbst zum Abschluss zu kommen oder einer Teamkollegin aufzulegen. Sie ist die einzige Spielerin dieser Saison, die nach Carries, also Ballführungen über mindestens fünf Meter, an insgesamt vier Toren direkt beteiligt war – zweimal traf sie selbst, zweimal legte sie im Anschluss an einen Carry einen Treffer auf.  Die beste Zweikämpferin der Liga kommt aus den Reihen des SV Werder Bremen. Die 24-jährige Hanna Németh, die im Sommer 2022 von Ferencváros Budapest an die Weser gewechselt war, gewann in der laufenden Spielzeit herausragende 75% ihrer Duelle, damit sticht sie alle anderen Bundesliga-Spielerinnen aus (mind. 20 Zweikämpfe vorausgesetzt). Carolin Simon, Abwehrspielerin des FC Bayern, ist nach Hanna Németh die beste Zweikämpferin der Liga (mind. 20 Duelle), in 73% ihrer direkten Duelle ging sie als Siegerin hervor. Doch Simon ist nicht nur eine starke Verteidigerin, sie hat auch das Vermögen, ihre Mitspielerinnen clever in Szene setzen zu können. Die Linksverteidigerin bereite fünf Treffer vor, womit sie die beste Assistgeberin der Liga ist. Insbesondere bei ruhenden Bällen bringt sie die gegnerischen Abwehrreihen ins Schwitzen, denn vier ihrer fünf Assists kamen per Standardsituation, auch das ist Topwert (zusammen mit Wolfsburgs Felicitas Rauch). In der folgenden Grafik wird schön veranschaulicht, aus welcher Position sie Chancen kreierte, darunter sind drei Eckbälle von der rechten Seite, von denen zwei mit ihrem starken linken Fuß präzise in die Gefahrenzone gebracht wurden und in einem Tor mündeten. In den vergangenen 10 Spielzeiten holten sich entweder die Frauen des VfL Wolfsburg (siebenmal) oder des FC Bayern München (dreimal) die deutsche Meisterschaft, angesichts der aktuellen Tabellenkonstellation erscheint in dieser Saison eine Unterbrechung dieser Machtverhältnisse eher unwahrscheinlich. 2011/12 holte sich Turbine Potsdam den Titel, als bis dato letztes Team, das nicht Wolfsburg oder Bayern heißt. Doch von den erfolgreichen Jahren, in denen sechs Meisterschaften in der eingleisigen Bundesliga und sogar zwei Champions-League-Trophäen heraussprangen, ist in Potsdam wenig übriggeblieben. Turbine Potsdam belegt aktuell mit nur einem Punkt den letzten Tabellenplatz – in der Vorsaison stand am Ende immerhin der vierte Platz zu Buche. Doch auch hier gibt es Grund zur Hoffnung: Vor fünf Jahren war der MSV Duisburg gar mit 11 Niederlagen in die Saison gestartet, letztlich gelang mit 18 Punkten dennoch der Klassenerhalt.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2023/01/die-frauen-bundesliga-in-voller-datentiefe/,Tim Lutz,08/01/2023 7:20,the-analyst
11356,The Biggest World Cup Wins,"As the 2022 World Cup in Qatar creeps ever closer, we look back at some of the most lopsided matches in the history of the men’s World Cup. That honour is jointly held by Hungary and Yugoslavia, who have each recorded nine-goal victories. The record in the Women’s World Cup is held by the United States, who beat Thailand 13-0 in the group stage of the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup. Hungary 10-1 El Salvador: World Cup 1982Hungary 9-0 South Korea: World Cup 1954Yugoslavia 9-0 Zaire: World Cup 1974Sweden 8-0 Cuba: World Cup 1938Uruguay 8-0 Bolivia: World Cup 1950Germany 8-0 Saudi Arabia: World Cup 2002 POV: You’re the Hungarian national team and you’re the only side to score 10+ goals in a single men’s World Cup game. It follows that you’re the only team to register a double-digit win in World Cup history, and the eventual winning margin of nine goals is a joint World Cup record. But, after losing to reigning champions Argentina in your following match – a game in which, somehow, Argentina are allowed to take both the first-half and second-half kick-offs – you face Belgium. A 1-1 draw in that final game and you, Hungary, are eliminated at the group stage of the 1982 World Cup in Spain, despite registering a historic victory. In that mauling against El Salvador, it was Hungarian substitute László Kiss that stole the show. Coming off the bench in the second-half Kiss scored a hat-trick. Not only is his treble the only World Cup hat-trick by a substitute, but it’s the fastest ever hat-trick in a World Cup, grabbing his three in the space of seven minutes. Team-mate Laszlo Fazekas bagged himself a brace, as Kalaman Meszoely’s side put El Salvador to the sword. Italy would eventually win this World Cup, beating West Germany in the final 3-2. The Hungarians had been no strangers to huge World Cup wins, dishing another one out 28 years earlier against South Korea. This one came courtesy of Hungary’s Golden Team of the 1950s, built around a core of six key players: Ferenc Puskás, Sándor Kocsis, Nándor Hidegkuti, Zoltán Czibor, József Bozsik and Gyula Grosics. Gusztav Sebes’ side were huge favourites to win the tournament in Switzerland, and they opened the competition is superb style, smashing South Korea 9-0. Puskas – a year after his dissection of England at Wembley – netted twice, but it was Kocsis who exploded out the blocks. He scored a hat-trick in this game and then went on to score four in Hungary’s 8-3 group stage win over West Germany to become the first player to score multiple hat-tricks in a single World Cup. With two more goals in each of Hungary’s quarter-final and semi-final wins, Kocsis took his tournament tally to 11 – at that time a record for the highest number of goals scored in a single tournament. But despite coming up against a West Germany side in the final that they had beaten 8-3 during the group stage, the Magical Magyars were to lose the reverse fixture 3-2 in what became known as the Miracle of Bern. Hungary’s 1954 World Cup performance is record-breaking. They hold the record for the most goals in a single edition, the highest aggregate goal difference, and the highest goals per game rate. The only thing they didn’t win was the trophy… Group 2 of the 1974 FIFA World Cup was a strange one. The pool comprised of defending champions Brazil, alongside Scotland and Yugoslavia, as well as first-time qualifiers Zaire. Brazil, Scotland and Yugoslavia drew their games against each other, so the key to qualification rested on goal difference. Basically, how much could each of them beat Zaire by. Scotland managed a 2-0 victory, but Yugoslavia’s 9-0 victory saw them top the group table with a huge +9 goal difference. Yugoslavia raced out into a three-goal lead in the first 20 minutes. In response, Zaire’s manager Blagoje Vidinić – a former Yugoslav international himself – decided to substitute his goalkeeper. Off came Kazadi Muamba and on came 5-foot-4 Dimbi Tubilandu. Within a minute he’d conceded himself. He’d have to pick the ball out of his net a further five times that evening. The Yugoslavs were six goals to the good at half-time – the most goals scored in the first half of a World Cup game in history – and Dušan Bajević helped himself to a treble. However, despite topping their group in the first round, Yugoslavia lost all three of their matches in the second group phase, scoring just two goals in the process. In a nice twist, Yugoslavia are actually on the receiving end of the joint-biggest defeat in European Championships history (a 6-1 loss against the Netherlands in Euro 2000), and to date they’re the only side to concede six or more goals in a single Euros game. With the average age of their starting XI just 25 years and 351 days old against Zaire, the Yugoslavia side are the youngest team to appear on our list. Back in the days when the World Cup was a straight knockout affair, this quarter-final tie between Sweden and Cuba is technically the biggest World Cup win to take place outside the group stages. The Swedes progressed through their last-16 tie with Austria thanks to a walkover, while Cuba beat Romania following a replay. A 7,000-strong crowd in Antibes watched Sweden put eight goals passed Cuba. Both Gustav Wetterström and Harry Andersson helped themselves to a hat-trick, and this fixture remains the only match in World Cup history where two players from the same team have scored a hat-trick in the same game. France had to play seven matches to win the 2018 World Cup in Russia. In 1950, Uruguay only had to play four on the way to securing their second World Cup win.  In fact, their first triumph in 1930 only required four games as well. Both tournaments are the fewest matches required for a team to lift the Jules Rimet trophy. Uruguay’s first and only group game in 1950 came against Bolivia. France were meant to join the pair in Group 4, but had withdrawn after the draw, citing the amount of travel that would be required to play their group matches. So, while the likes of Brazil, Yugoslavia, Spain and England needed to battle it out in four-team groups, where only the top team went through, Uruguay had a one-off game against Bolivia. It ended up being a routine victory. With four goals in either half, Juan Lopez’s side were comfortable 8-0 winners. Oscar Miguez helped himself to a hat-trick, one of only three Uruguayan players to achieve this feat. 1950 was the only World cup tournament not decided by a one-match final, with Uruguay winning a final group stage against the Brazilians, Swedes and Spanish. Germany’s 8-0 victory at the 2002 World Cup against Saudi Arabia is the biggest World Cup win in the 21st Century. After 20 minutes, Miroslav Klose opened the scoring on his World Cup debut, stooping low to head in a skidding cross from the left. It was his first World Cup goal, and it wouldn’t be his last. Just five minutes later he’d added a second with a trademark bullet header. The World Cup’s leading goalscorer completed his hat-trick and Germany’s fifth midway through the second half, with his third header, turning in Bernd Schneider’s cross. Klose is only the second player in World Cup history to score a hat-trick of headers in a single World Cup game, after Tomas Skuhravy did it for Czechoslovakia against Costa Rica in World Cup ’90. He’s one of 13 players to score a hat-trick on their World Cup debut, but no player has managed to do it since Klose in June 2002. Not only has Klose scored more World Cup goals than any other player, he’s also scored more headers than anyone else as well, ahead of compatriot Gerd Müller. Across his career, Klose scored 16 times in 24 appearances across four separate tournaments. The only other players to score in as many as four World Cup tournaments are compatriot Uwe Seeler, Portuguese Cristiano Ronaldo and Pelé. Less than 12 months after their 5-1 humbling by England in Munich, Germany would reach the World Cup final in South Korea and Japan, where they would finish runners-up to Ronaldo’s Brazil 2-0 in the final.

11442,Victoria Williams on How Data Helps Her Improve and How Brighton Prepare Against the Top Three,"15 September 2019 – Chelsea require a 91st-minute equaliser from Finnish striker Adelina Engman to salvage a point against Brighton at The People’s Pension Stadium in Crawley. 7 February 2021 – Two goals from corners see Brighton come from behind to end Chelsea’s 33-game unbeaten run. 23 January 2022 – Erin Cuthbert hits the bar as Chelsea are held to a 0-0 draw by Brighton despite having 26 shots There are few fixtures in the Women’s Super League that have developed as much lore around them as when Brighton and Chelsea meet each other. Brighton are the only side to have taken points off the title holders in each of the last three seasons. Arsenal have not managed to, Manchester City have not managed to, but Brighton, a team who average 27 points a season seem to just specifically get at Chelsea. Victoria Williams, Brighton’s longstanding central defender and captain, insists it is something much more simple than some kind of curse placed on Chelsea. “Really, I think it is just more about the diligence and your preparation.” “I just think we prepare for every game meticulously. The technical staff give us every realistic situation that might occur. But ultimately, when it comes down to it on the day, it’s the players on the pitch that ultimately decides it.” “So, I can’t tell you whether they underprepared for us or not – only they know that.” When it comes to Chelsea in particular, Williams is keen to emphasise that the way Brighton set up to play is not just a passive reaction. “I’ve seen teams just go out and press Chelsea from the front, and I’ve seen the devastating effects of that. It’s not a case of just opening yourself up to that quality of player because if you turn the ball over in the wrong areas, they’ll just punish you. And then before you know it, you’re out of the game.” “Every game, we have to prepare to win. So even though that might look like ceding possession, so it looks like we’re just sitting in a block and we don’t want to win the game, that’s not the case.” “It’s all about finding a way to win, finding a way to get something out of the game.” Brighton have endured a tough start to the season with heavy losses to Arsenal (who they played against with ten players for the majority of the game after an early red card for Emma Kullberg) and Manchester United, although they did pick up a win against Reading. As they were last season, Brighton remain one of the most direct teams in the WSL, but Williams is keen to stress the context around some of their stylistic choices at the start of the season. “Obviously, the first game against Arsenal, we went down to 10 players within seven minutes which ultimately changed how we were going to have to manage that game.” Brighton started their own passing sequences 28.4m from their own goal against Arsenal, the deepest of any side in a single game this season. “Based on the data that came out from that game, we’re obviously in a low block, quite deep, which means then the outlet ball comes on regain and playing against a team that counter press quite well when they turn over the ball, especially in our defensive third. I think it meant that a lot more passes went direct a lot sooner.” “If I think about the Reading game, we were maybe a bit disappointed about how we played in possession in terms of ball retention. Because it’s actually our idea not to be direct. Most of the pre-season, we’ve actually been focused a lot more on maintaining possession and moving the ball around the pitch.” Brighton played their match against Reading at the American Express Community Stadium, a change from their normal home at the Broadfield Stadium in Crawley. “We actually trained on the exact pitch dimensions because the AmEx is bigger. We had to have our pitches adjusted for it. So ideally, obviously, the game plan was to utilise that extra space and the players that we have got in those areas.” Despite Brighton’s stellar record against Chelsea, they have struggled against other bigger teams. When it comes to approaching those games, Williams says they try and be realistic. “First and foremost, it’s just sort of the acceptance of the quality that you are coming up against. Generally against the top three, if you turn the ball over in certain areas, they are a lot more clinical and ruthless than other teams. In general, you tend to get pressed a lot higher, as well as in your build up play. So sometimes it’s about bypassing that and not giving them the opportunity.” “All the things we do are [about] trying to counteract their strengths and still play to ours. You have to accept that you might not have as much of the ball as you’d like. But that doesn’t mean when we have the ball that we want to rush the game.” Williams uses last year’s draw with Chelsea as an example. “We played on the front foot quite a lot in that game. Where we might have a mid to low block in general, you always have to add context, so if the game starts feeling like we can enjoy a little bit more of the ball, and they’re beginning to drop off, you can move forward. So, it’s about game understanding.” “Obviously, the longer you hold those teams, the more confidence you gain from that and actually start thinking about opportunities. Most of the time, I presume they’re coming to those games, quite confident. But if you can knock that confidence during the game, by being hard to break down, in general, I’ve noticed they get frustrated a lot sooner. And that’s when gaps start to appear. Then we can really start to impose our game on them rather it being one-way traffic.” When it comes to Williams’ own game, she is a very front-foot defender who last season led Brighton in terms of clearances per 90 and blocks per 90. Only Louise Quinn at Birmingham made more headed clearances per 90 than Williams. She is particularly proud of her increase in the number of progressive carries she made per match, finishing second behind former Brighton defender Maya Le Tissier, who made a summer move to Manchester United. “A couple of the targets I set myself last year from the beginning of the season were based on raw data. I wanted to complete more passes but also move the ball forward, so they were easy things for me to identify in terms of steps.” “Looking at video footage, I was able to pinpoint areas where you know I passed when I could have travelled, or I’ve travelled when I should have passed.” “I put in progressive passes and carries because I didn’t just want to be completing passes for the sake of it.” At the same time, Williams emphasises that when it comes to considering her actions within Brighton’s backline, balance is key. “We’ve been looking at team structure and like ‘What are the players in your team trying to do?” “If I can provide balance by just retaining the ball and recycling the ball, that’s not always in a negative sense.” It is something she has had to reassess this season with Brighton having undergone a huge squad turnover in the summer, including losing two key members of their defence in Maya Le Tissier and Emma Koivisto. A further blow came when returning signing Rebekah Stott picked up an injury before the season had even begun. “It is quite a new look squad. Even in terms of players that we’ve retained, at the minute one of my centre-back partners is Kayleigh Green, who is actually a striker.” “Defensive partnerships are all about relationships and understanding each other. So I wouldn’t say it’s had a negative impact. It’s more just a case of getting used to situations and learning. I think, for me as a defender, what is important is knowing where players are more likely to pop out into.” Once Williams knows what her defensive counterparts are likely to do, it allows her to put herself in a position between the event and her own player. “The more you play together, the easier those decisions get,” she explains. “It allows you to be more active and make decisions sooner, knowing the likelihood of [what they are going to do]” For Brighton and Williams, there is certainly a need to sure up that backline quickly. The games against Arsenal and Manchester United will not define their season, but there has certainly been a sense early on that this is a team who are not as defensively solid as they might have been in the past. Despite that, you would not bet against them being able to find a way to frustrate Chelsea once again come Sunday.

11445,"The Favourites, The Challengers and the Fresh Faces: Women’s Champions League 2022-23 Preview","The UEFA Women’s Champions League is arguably the ultimate prize in women’s football across Europe. It’s a badge of honour only worn a select few, and 2022-23 promises to be no different. Records will once again be broken again and there’ll be more eyes on the competition than ever before. The draw has bestowed us with some tasty groups, including a few matchups well worthy of being a knockout game. We comb through the data to look at the potential contenders, challengers and a couple of new kids on the block. The giants of the women’s game. With six UEFA Women’s Champions League titles in the last seven years – five of them coming back-to-back – Lyon are perpetual contenders. They are once again the defending champions coming into this campaign. But injuries have plagued them again this season, with long-term injuries to starting centre-back, Griedge Mbock, and right-back Ellie Carpenter. They especially look thin at the centre-back position after also losing Kadeisha Buchanan to Chelsea in the summer. In attack, star striker and Women’s Champions League’s all-time top goalscorer with 59 goals, Ada Hegerberg, is unavailable. Last season’s breakout star, Catarina Macario, is out with a long-term injury as well. Two of Germany’s finest midfielders, Dzsenifer Marozsan and Sara Däbritz, the latter of whom arrived this summer from direct rivals Paris Saint-Germain, are also out. Lyon’s medical room is at capacity. With a host of injuries and some key players entering their twilight, manager Sonia Bompastor has a new challenge on her hands this season if she is to defend her European title. The squad is still littered with talent, and Lyon are more than capable of causing any team problems. Starlets like Melvine Malard and Damaris Egurrola are still relatively young and have only grown in stature. Delphine Cascarino’s development over the years has seen her turn into one of the pillars of the squad. The French international is extremely adept at progressing play by carrying the ball forwards, and her close ball control enables her to dribble around defenders with ease. Her acceleration allows her to ghost past and generate separation, from which she can then create chances for her team-mates. Although her final ball needs some polishing, she currently leads the charts in France for most chance-creating carries in the league (nine) and has the fourth-highest number of carries involving a take-on (nine). Selma Bacha has been one of the most important players under Bompastor. Bacha recorded the most assists for the French champions last season with 16 in all competitions. The 21-year-old Lyon academy graduate has a devilish delivery from crosses and set-piece situations. She’s also very good at providing supporting overlapping runs, helping Lyon create chances from wide areas. Lyon are Lyon and despite their injuries, it’d be foolish to bet against the team that knows the ins and outs of this competition better than anyone else. Barcelona have firmly established themselves as one of the biggest teams in women’s football with an ability to attract the very best talent. Their stature was further solidified with the arrivals of England internationals and European champions, Lucy Bronze and Keira Walsh. While injury to arguably the world’s best women’s footballer, Alexia Putellas, does weaken the Blaugrana machine, they have been smart with their recruitment in the summer.  With five reinforcements arriving, Barcelona have addressed the pressing concerns in their squads at full-back position with the arrival of left-back Nuria Rábano (from Real Sociedad) and right-back Lucy Bronze (from Manchester City). They have further added attacking depth in the form of Brazilian youngster, Geyse Ferreira, and Spanish prodigy, Vicky López, adding depth for the future in the process. Bronze is a big addition. The European Champion is excellent at progressing play with her carries, able to drive powerfully forward to provide penetration in the final third. She ranked second among full-backs and seventh overall for progressive carries of 10 or more metres in the WSL last season (66), underlining her ability to drive long distances with the ball. She’s relentless in her pursuit to advance possession which might result in some questionable positioning in defensive situations at times. Keira Walsh had her crowning moment in the summer and that quickly saw her become the most expensive signing in women’s football history with her move to Barcelona. Walsh’s poise on the ball and her awareness without it makes her one of the best in her role. While not directly involved in shots, Walsh is extremely good at knitting play together and is often involved in long periods of possession that ultimately lead to shots. She was involved in the second most open-play build-up sequences (moves involving at least 10 passes) that led to shots in the WSL last season (66). The vision, range and execution on her passes allow her to circulate and retain possession while still being incisive. With Bronze and Walsh capable of retaining and progressing the ball in the attacking third using their passing and ball carrying, Barcelona shouldn’t find it difficult to sustain possession in the final third. Not that it was a problem area for them in the past. Barcelona find themselves up against Bayern, Rosengard and Benfica in the group stage and will be aiming for another final appearance this year. They have all the tools to do so. Wolfsburg are one of the OGs of the game and have consistently been among the top teams for over a decade now. The title, however, has escaped the hands of the team to successfully defend it in 2013. The club is transitioning into a new era, with major turnovers at the club that saw eight new signings arrive last season and a further three this summer. Wolfsburg’s recruitment has seen them secure some of Germany’s finest talents like Jule Brand and Lena Oberdorf. 20-year-old Oberdorf was voted Young Player of the Tournament at this summer’s Women’s European Championships and has all the hallmarks of being one of the best players in women’s football for years to come. She’s integral in providing a foundation for Wolfsburg to build an attack from. She has already proved that in the Bundesliga this year, regaining possession three times before initiating an open-play sequence for her side that resulted in a shot, a figure higher than anyone else in the league. Like Walsh, the German midfielder is an integral part of the build-up phases for her side and has been involved in 10 build-up sequences leading to a shot, the second-highest highest in the league. It’s her game-reading, prescient movements and physical robustness that make her an insurmountable presence in the centre of the park. The German stalwart has won 21 duels and has recovered possession 16 times in three games so far. While their backline seems shaky, Wolfsburg have one of the best screening presences ahead of their defence. At 20, Oberdorf is already a pillar in the team. The return of Ewa Pajor bolsters the squad further. The Polish striker, who has struggled with a knee problem in the last couple of seasons, has scored three and assisted three in her three league appearances so far, leading the charts in both categories. The 25-year-old is a menacing presence to deal with thanks to her speed and elusive movement and is consistently involved in the final product. No player has been involved in more open-play shot-ending sequences than the Wolfsburg striker (24). Seventeen of those have been direct shot involvements (when Pajor’s only involvement in a move is taking the final shot) showing how she is consistently the focal point of attack for her side. Wolfsburg’s project is still in its nascent stages, as the players they have recruited are yet to reach their full potential. The prospect is scary, and Wolfsburg seem ready to push for the podium this year. Paris Saint Germain have been the perennial pretenders at the European stage, always sidekicks to the mighty Lyon in France and in Europe. This season is different. The turnover at the club in terms of players and the manager has meant PSG are still discovering their identity and lack synergy. Injuries haven’t helped either. The club’s all-time leading goalscorer, Marie-Antoinette Katoto, is set to miss the season with an injury picked up at the Euros. The 23-year-old is one of the most efficient and lethal players inside the box, scoring at least 15 goals in each of her last six league seasons. Everything points to Kadidiatou Diani taking on an ever-bigger role in the squad in Katoto’s absence. She leads the table for goals scored in the league (four) and sits joint second in the assist table (two).  Her ability to take on a player while carrying the ball has been a major source of threat for the Parisians. No player recorded more carries with take-ons than Diani last season (42) but this season with an added responsibility to be the goalscoring threat as well, it’ll be interesting to see how this impacts her carrying and take-on volume. While the Parisians have enough firepower in attack to ask questions of any defence, their backline doesn’t inspire the same amount of confidence. Starting centre-back, Paulina Dudek has succumbed to a season-long injury as well. Losing Dudek has severely weakened the backline, with the Polish centre-back heavily involved in the Parisian’s build-up and defensive activities. She was regularly tasked with carrying the ball out of defence for her team – no player had more 10+ metre carries (102) and higher carry directness (59% of her carrying distance was directly upfield) than the Poland international. It will be interesting to see how PSG replace that. Full-backs will once again be vital for the French side. Ashley Lawrence and Sakina Karchaoui are excellent ball progressors. Both Lawrence and Karchaoui rank in the top five for long progressive carries last season with 96 and 91 respectively, and they will once again be tasked with getting the team up the pitch. In midfield, Grace Geyoro is one of the absolute pillars of the squad and will be even more integral given the injuries and integration of new faces. The arrival of Jackie Groenen from Manchester United does help the Paris side but the synergy between different moving parts is still lacking. Injuries and departures leave a big void to be filled and how they cope with that, alongside a change in play style under a new manager, remains to be seen. The Parisians do find themselves in a tricky group alongside Chelsea and Real Madrid and this might be their toughest challenge in the competition yet. But PSG have shown in the past that as long as the opponent isn’t Lyon, they are very much capable of holding their own. Chelsea are an enigma at this stage of the season. The Blues brought in five new players this summer and while their signings are all established players, they are still finding their footing in Emma Hayes’ system. This lack of synergy may explain their opening-day loss to newcomers Liverpool in the WSL. The arrivals of Johanna Rytting Kaneryd and Jelena Čanković add lots of offensive value while Kadeisha Buchanan and Ève Périsset have come in sure up the defence. Beyond the obvious quality, there are many unanswered questions surrounding Chelsea at this stage of the season. Do they persist with a back three or shift to a traditional back four with club captain, Magda Eriksson, moving to left-back? Who plays in the wing-back roles and how can they strike balance between the fluidity and structure in the offensive gameplan while retaining defensive solidity? Despite the concerns and questions, the talent pool at Chelsea is undeniable. Erin Cuthbert’s transformation into an all-action midfielder for Chelsea last season was one of the squad’s key developments. Operating as the deepest midfielder now, Cuthbert is at the heart of regaining possession and kickstarting sequences for Chelsea. The 23-year-old regained possession 11 times before starting off an open-play sequence that ended in a shot, the second-highest rate in the league. Kirby provides robustness and is a tireless worker without the ball, closing down opponents and causing turnovers in dangerous areas. England international Fran Kirby has been a pillar of Hayes’ side and is the creative hub for Chelsea. Her partnership with Sam Kerr has been one of the deadliest across Europe. During the 2021-22 season, Kirby ranked fourth in the league for direct chance involvements (29), underlining her ability to play the final killer ball. She has continued to be decisive in front of goal this season, scoring in each of Chelsea’s three league appearances so far. Members of another group of death in the UWCL this season, Chelsea will be looking to make amends for last campaign. Despite the disappointment of last year, Chelsea remain a side that can pack a punch if they can piece together a coherent side with the plethora of talent at their disposal. AS Roma have continued their rise under Alessandro Spugna. The club had a strong campaign last season and finished second in the league only behind Juventus, putting in some very strong performances. Their performances are strongly reflected in the underlying metrics as well. The underlying numbers show they deserved this finish too, with their 45.9 total expected goals and 15.5 expected goals against, both the second-best figures in the league. Despite existing as a club for only four years, after taking over the license of Res Roma, they’ve already won their first trophy (the Coppa Italia in the 2020-21 season), and the club has continued to strengthen its position in the summer with an influx of six new signings. The reinforcements this season seem like a step in the right direction, raising the team’s floor and ceiling at the same time. Veteran Italian striker, Valentina Giacinti, adds a much-needed true number nine presence. The former Milan striker is a master at getting shots off for herself. No player has more direct shot involvements than the 28-year-old Italian (15) so far this year, highlighting how she is the conclusion to a lot of attacking moves by Roma. As a direct consequence of this, Roma have improved on the offensive end and have recorded the second-highest shots in the league so far. Giacinti is just as intense with her off-ball work rate, consistently closing down ball carriers and passing lanes. She is always ready to put in a shift for the team. 23-year-old Annamaria Serturini is already a club giant in her own right. She is the all-time leading appearance maker for the club with 96 and leads the chart for most goals scored along with being the first-ever goalscorer for the club as well, having come through their youth ranks.  She has recorded the third-most shot-ending carries in the league this season, underlining her proclivity to run with the ball before firing a shot or creating an opportunity for her team-mate. While their defence hasn’t looked assured yet, incoming signings Moeka Minami and Carina Wenninger add necessary steel to the rear guard. Full-back Elin Landström provides a two-way presence from the flanks along with an addition of physicality. Minami, in particular, has become a vital part of their build-up. The 23-year-old Japanese centre-back adds value with her passing ability, helping the side to play out from the back. She is a key part of the possession scheme at Roma, with no player having more open-play sequence involvements (258) or open-play build-up involvements than the Roma centre-back (252) last season. Whenever her side have the ball, Minami is generally heavily involved. In midfield, Manuela Giugliano continues to marshal the troops. The 24-year-old Italian is an excellent distributor and operates as the deep-lying playmaker for the side, and she is blessed with exquisite range and vision on her passes. The current squad allows Spugna the flexibility to change formations and adopt different approaches. They find themselves in Group B alongside Wolfsburg, Slavia Praha and SKN St. Pölten, which will be a challenge. They are favourable fixtures in there though, and Spugna’s side will like their chances to advance into the knockout stages. There’s plenty of room for improvement but Roma have the tools to surprise this season. Real Madrid are making their second straight appearance in the UEFA Women’s Champions League group stages after completing the takeover of CD Tacon in 2019. The club has been on an upward trajectory following a managerial change last season, managing to finish third in the league and qualify for the UWCL qualification rounds. This season under Alberto Toril, Las Blancas have won all their games. The positive trend has been visible in the arrivals at the club this season as well. Signings of French international, Sandie Toletti, alongside Manchester City and Scottish superstar, Caroline Weir adds undeniable quality on and off the ball for the Royal Whites. Weir has already been an influential figure at the club, directly contributing to five goals and three assists. The Scottish midfielder has been handed the freedom to roam and to influence games with her on-ball quality. An excellent ball carrier, Weir helps her side beat the opposition press while retaining possession and gaining territory. Her balance and close control while carrying make it difficult to dispossess her. Weir adds verticality in possession with her positioning. She consistently places herself in between the lines, in half-spaces to receive the passes. She is heavily involved in the final third and isn’t shot shy, often arriving in the box at the right time to get her shots off. Athenea del Castillo continues her rise to superstardom, with the Spaniard being decisive in games on a consistent basis for the club this season. The youngster already has four goals and three assists to her name, forming a formidable partnership with Weir. The former Deportivo player is a menacing ball carrier, combining her skills with her pace to leave defenders in the dust with her dribbling. She recorded the joint-third most ball carries with take-on last season in the UWCL despite Real Madrid getting knocked out at the quarter-final stages and recorded a total of 52 take-ons – no one attempted more. Real Madrid have inherited some great European pedigree and now with more experience in the tank, they seem very much capable of packing a punch and ruffling feathers in what seems like the group of death. The quarter-finalists in their first run in the competition will be looking to go one better and finish in the final four.

11471,Five Burning Questions That Need Answering Ahead of the WSL’s Return,"As the English Women’s Super League gets set to begin its most high-profile season yet, the main question will be whether anyone can stop Chelsea from winning. For a league that prides itself on its competitiveness, one team winning four consecutive titles would rather put pay to that notion. Manchester City and Arsenal will once again be the main contenders, but they will be forced to look over their shoulder as teams below continue to strengthen in an attempt to reach the Champions League spots. At the bottom, however, there are dark clouds gathering over Leicester and Brighton. Ahead of the WSL’s return this weekend, here are five burning questions that need answering. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, “to lose one starter may be regarded as a misfortune, to lose four looks like carelessness.” Yet Manchester City go into the WSL season adjusting to life without Ellen White (retired), Lucy Bronze (Barcelona), Caroline Weir (Real Madrid), and Georgia Stanway (Bayern Munich). In total, City have lost players who played 8,093 minutes for them last season, the third most of any team in the WSL and vastly more than their main title rivals, Chelsea (2102) and Arsenal (1424). They have brought in plenty of replacements with Leila Ouahabi (Barcelona), Deyna Castellanos (Atlético Madrid), Laia Aleixandri (Atlético Madrid), Mary Fowler (Montpelier), Sandy MacIver (Everton), and Kerstin Casparij (FC Twente) rounding up what has been a very productive transfer window for the blue half of Manchester. Yet with four of the six recruits 23 years old or under, it is reasonable to expect them to take time to adapt to the league and Gareth Taylor’s system. Of all the positions where City have now lost players, centre-forward is one they shouldn’t need to worry about. Bunny Shaw shared minutes with Ellen White last season but will now be a guaranteed starter and have a real opportunity to show the WSL what she is capable of. Shaw is a much more versatile striker than White was, as her shot map shows, with the Jamaican popping up all over the penalty box to fire off attempts.   Of her nine WSL goals from last season, three were with her left foot, four with her right, and two with her head, showing just how well-rounded a player she is. However, she may need to start making those near-post runs that White excelled at to truly get the most out of Lauren Hemp and Chloe Kelly’s crosses. In Magdalena Eriksson and Millie Bright, Chelsea have long had one of the best defensive partnerships in the WSL, but the addition of Kadeisha Buchanan is set to take it to a new level. The Canadian and ex-Lyon centre-back has established herself as one of the best in the world, and early signs are that she will not take long to settle at Chelsea. Her performance in the Champions League final against Barcelona, where she was forced to come on after only 14 minutes following an injury to Ellie Carpenter, is the perfect example of her all-action displays which often involve her stepping out of the backline to intervene. The question remains as to how exactly this will work. Experiments in pre-season have seen Emma Hayes try a back four with Eriksson at left-back, a role she has played for Sweden, but Buchanan could also play as the central centre-back in the back-three system Hayes preferred last year. The player most likely to miss out as a result will be Jess Carter, who played almost every single minute of Chelsea’s WSL campaign last season but will likely play second fiddle to another new Chelsea recruit, Ève Périsset, at right-back. Carter’s defending went to another level last year, eventually earning her a place in Sarina Wiegman’s England squad. But Périsset is no slouch either, attempting the second most tackles of any player in the French team at the Euros over the summer. Carter’s biggest asset is her versatility – Hayes trusts her to play anywhere across the backline. Whilst it might not yet be clear exactly how Chelsea will line up defensively, it is clear they have significantly strengthened what was an area of real weakness for them. Both Périsset and Buchanan have serious international pedigree whilst Katerina Svitkova was recruited from West Ham and could offer cover at left wing-back if Hayes was to persist with the back three. It will make it very difficult for anyone to stop them from adding a fourth consecutive WSL title to their trophy cabinet. Every year in the WSL, we ask if any team has the ability to break into the Champions League spots with Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea having had the top three sewn up every year since 2014. Manchester United have pushed close in the past two seasons, finishing five points behind City last season and only one behind Arsenal the year before. If United are to break into that top three, they will be looking to Mary Earps to bring her very best form. Earps played more minutes than any other goalkeeper in the WSL last season but conceded over four more goals than she was expected to do based on the quality of shots she faced. While the England stopper will be disappointed at those numbers, her figure of -4.4 goals prevented is still the fourth best of any goalkeeper who played more than 900 minutes across the season. However, her performances at Euro 2022 were sublime and certainly justify United expecting to see a higher level from her this season. Only Belgium’s Nicky Evrard (7.0) prevented more goals than Earps’ 5.3. At least with Caroline Weir safely in Madrid, she won’t be able to lob Earps in the Manchester derby. Weir scored more goals against Earps than she did any other goalkeeper in the WSL (3). Tottenham are the other team who might have an eye on a run at Champions League qualification. Rehanne Skinner’s team conceded almost as few goals as Manchester City and Manchester United but struggled to score themselves. The recruitment of Nikola Karczewska and Celin Bizet is an attempt to improve on that this season. Karczewska finished the joint-sixth highest scorer in the D1 Arkema in France last season, whilst Bizet has yet to truly make an impact at club level but is incredibly highly thought of in her native Norway. Karczewska has the added advantage of being 6-foot tall, making her set to be one of the tallest players in the league this season. Okay, that was less of a question and more a nice combination of words. Jonas Eidevall will embark on his second season as Arsenal manager hoping to end a three-season trophy-less run, their longest dry spell since they were formed back in 1987. Eidevall’s most distinctive stamp on this Arsenal team has been to move the WSL’s all-time top goalscorer, Vivianne Miedema, into her favoured number 10 role. The move did little to hinder her goal scoring with Miedema scoring six of her fourteen goals last season after her move slightly further back. But as the above touch graphic shows, it did let her get far more involved in Arsenal’s build up, averaging more touches in all zones apart from the ones closest to the opposition goal.  The decision was also prompted by the recruitment of Stina Blackstenius who immediately showed her connection with Miedema for an exceptional equaliser against Manchester United in February. From the duo’s pass map, we can see that Miedema is given a lot of freedom in terms of where she drops to link up with Blackstenius. One interesting addition to the pair’s relationship is Arsenal’s recruitment of Lina Hurtig. Hurtig can technically play all across the front line but has in the past been Blackstenius’ direct competition for the central striker position at Sweden. As can be seen from her Champions League shot map, she likes to drift in from the left, even if she is nominally the number nine, and offers Arsenal an additional option there. However, it leaves Beth Mead as their only ostensible right winger. There was not much to separate Leicester City and Birmingham City last season. Only a two-point difference saw Birmingham relegated to the Championship, and it is hard to look past Leicester being the first team since Doncaster Belles in 2016 to be promoted and then relegated from the top division of women’s football. Lydia Bedford’s team’s key problem is that they conceded more opportunities than any other side in the WSL last year, racking up an expected goals against tally of 37.8. Much like their men’s team, Leicester’s recruitment has been incredibly limited, only bringing in Erin Simon on the defensive side. Bedford will be asking significantly more of her side this season if they are to avoid the drop. Leicester’s biggest hope might come in the form of Brighton. Hope Powell’s side have lost a strong core of their team this summer with Maya Le Tissier heading to Manchester United, Emma Koivisto to Liverpool, Inessa Kaagman to PSV and Aileen Whelan to Leicester. However, Powell has consistently shown herself to be able to marshal a very creditable team with limited resources and the return of New Zealand international Rebekah Stott to the coast, following her cancer treatment, will be a big boost.

11472,Six Breakout Stars to Watch in the WSL 2022-23,"There are plenty of big names who starred at Euro 2022 who can be expected to have a big impact on the upcoming English Women’s Super League season. All eyes will be on Beth Mead, Alessia Russo and Ella Toone to see if they can replicate their summer form at club level. But who are the players who could end up making their own mark on the 2022-23 campaign? We pick out six players worth watching this year. When Lauren James signed for Chelsea last season from Manchester United, she became the most expensive signing in history between two WSL clubs. The attention on her was immense. Not only was James justifiably regarded as one of the most talented up and coming English players, but the fact that her brother Reece was already an established star at Chelsea only saw more attention poured on top of the transfer. And then she… disappeared. James featured for only 113 minutes of Chelsea’s WSL campaign last season, not making a single start in the league and scoring a solitary goal. Critics suggested this was just another example of Chelsea hoovering up talent whilst the club said they wanted to give her the time to get properly fit after a mixed injury record at United. Now it seems James is raring to go. Picking up her first England cap at the weekend, she has shown in pre-season just how much she can offer this Chelsea side. Her dribbling ability makes it seem like the ball sticks to her feet. In the 2019-20 season, only Rinsola Babajide completed more dribbles than James (3.8 per 90 vs 3.7). Where Chelsea in the past have struggled to unpick low blocks, James is set to offer a totally new skillset to the current champions. It can be hard to adjust to a new club when you arrive halfway through the season but it did not take long for Stina Blackstenius to settle in at Arsenal. Blackstenius scored six goals in seven starts for her new side in the second half of the season, but the pressure will be greater as she enters her first full season in the WSL. Blackstenius excels when she is running into space, with her ability to sniff out vacated areas allowing her to take high-quality shots. She demonstrated this perfectly at the Euros for Sweden where she ended up with the third highest xG per 90. In some ways Blackstenius has had the pressure of her role removed because the woman she is replacing is still playing for Arsenal. But all eyes will be on not just how she interacts with Vivianne Miedema, but also with Beth Mead and Caitlin Foord. The WSL has been home to some thrilling Golden Boot races over the past years. If Arsenal are going to make a good run at the title, they will need Blackstenius to be part of it. Maya Le Tissier has long been one of the most highly regarded young defenders in the WSL, with the Brighton player seemingly having her choice of top clubs. In the end, Manchester United paid her release clause this summer to bring her north. In Le Tissier, United are getting a player who made her WSL debut as a 16-year-old and someone who has missed only three minutes of league football over the past two seasons. That will have been very attractive to a club who have seen their defence decimated by injuries recently. At Brighton, Le Tissier excelled defensively, making the most interceptions, the second most clearances, and the second most tackles. The question will be how she adapts to a system where the focus will less be about fighting fires and more about progressing and passing the ball. Her passing accuracy from last season was only 66.9% which means there will be a big improvement required, and quickly. But there is no doubt that she is an incredibly accomplished defender given she is entering her fifth WSL season at the age of only 20. For Manchester United, it is also very savvy business. Le Tissier can play as a right-sided centre-back or as a right-back. The club reportedly resisted a number of bids from Barcelona for current first-choice right-back Ona Batlle who is consequently entering the final year of her deal. Now they have the opportunity to bed Le Tissier into their system before Batlle likely moves on next summer. When Filippa Angeldahl arrived at Manchester City at the start of last season, City had secured the services of one of Sweden’s most highly rated midfielders. It was some surprise then, when she started only six games across the entirety of the season. Now with two of City’s starting midfielders in Caroline Weir and Georgia Stanway having moved on, Angeldahl looks primed to finally make her impact on this Manchester City team. Primarily operating on the right-hand side of midfield (where Stanway formerly played), Angeldahl is not the kind of midfielder who is looking to always get into the box, preferring instead to link up with players out on the wing. She is adept at dropping back if she needs to, to provide cover for other players to get higher up the pitch while she helps with build-up play. Angeldahl is also keen on playing riskier passes which means whilst her accuracy might not be as high as some players, she can find that moment to unlock a defence. Angeldahl is not shy of taking a shot either. Her reputation for incredible long-range efforts was high even before the Euros but she showcased her technical ability with the goals she scored for Sweden during the competition. Both came from set pieces where Angeldahl was able to drill the ball on target with her first touch. City will need to get their new look midfield up to speed and fast. Angeldahl is the perfect player to help them do so. It came as some surprise when at the end of a successful season with West Ham, manager Olli Harder announced his departure from the club. In his place has stepped former assistant Paul Konchesky who will have a hard act to follow. Whilst Harder’s methods did not always translate to on-pitch success, there was a real sense that he was building something at the club. Fortunately for West Ham, they have kept the vast majority of their players from last year but just last week they suffered a big blow in losing Yui Hasegawa to Manchester City. The 25-year-old Japanese midfielder impressed with her guile and footwork, and seems to have spent pre-season largely scoring ridiculously good goals. Hasegawa was used by Harder both in a number 10 role and further back in the midfield, but it is when she is in advanced positions that she really excels. Hasegawa has the vision to pick out passes and shots which opposition defenders find incredibly hard to read. She is not afraid of finding her way into the penalty area either, with her deftness of touch allowing her to feint past players. She only scored twice for West Ham last season, but expect that number to go up this year as her confidence seems to only be growing. It is testament to Jorja Fox’s ability that this week she made her first start for the England U23s, having been a key part of the England U19 team only a couple of months ago. Fox is a player who everyone seems to know is going to have a breakout moment – the only question is when. Having been loaned to Brighton by Chelsea, she now has her first opportunity to get regular WSL minutes, after she made her WSL debut as a 17-year-old. Fox will have a tough task ahead of her in a Brighton team that has lost key parts of its defence in Maya Le Tissier and Emma Koivisto this summer. With the ability to play at left or right-back, Fox has spoken about her desire to learn more of the defensive side of the game from Hope Powell. She looks set to get a good chunk of minutes this season and if she thrives could find herself back playing WSL football for Chelsea next year.

11491,One of the Greats: Looking Back at Ellen White’s Career,"“This is my time to say goodbye to football and watch the next generation shine.” It is rare to see a player who has just started every single match for her nation in a tournament-winning campaign retire, but on Monday afternoon Ellen White announced that she would be stepping away from football. England Women’s all-time greatest scorer and the Women’s Super League’s second highest goal scorer, White closes her career as one of the all-time greats of women’s football, having spent 17 years terrorising defences worldwide. The list of clubs that White played for is indicative of how much the women’s game has changed. Having come through the Arsenal academy, White played her pre-WSL football at Chelsea and then Leeds. But she began the WSL-era at Arsenal after the Leeds squad was disbanded. Moves to Notts County and Birmingham City came later, although White’s minutes were often limited due to injury, whilst she finished her career with three seasons at Manchester City. Her most successful scoring season came in 2017-18 where she scored 15 goals in the WSL for Marc Skinner’s Birmingham City, helping them finish fifth. Impressively those 15 goals came in only 13 starts, with a hat-trick against her former club Arsenal a particular highlight of the season. Probably her most famous goal was against Arsenal when she was playing at Notts County. With a free kick on the edge of the area, White, Laura Bassett and Alex Greenwood crowded round the ball. The three looked prepared to do a complicated routine until Bassett and Greenwood seemed to have an argument about the set up. Greenwood nudged the ball to White who smashed it in amid the general confusion of the Arsenal players as to whether the whole thing was on purpose. Clearly, White showed little mercy to any of her former teams. She scored seven times against Arsenal after leaving them, and five times against Birmingham City. It was Everton who she enjoyed playing the most in the WSL though, with eight goals in fifteen appearances against them. Leicester City were the only WSL team she played against without scoring. White scored her 50th WSL goal on 7 November 2020 as part of an 8-1 thrashing of Bristol City, becoming the second-ever player – after Vivianne Miedema – to reach the total, and was briefly the all-time leading scorer. Overall White scored 59 WSL goals, 35 with her favoured right foot, 16 with her left foot and eight with her head. None of her goals scored were penalties, and the only penalty she took in the competition – against Arsenal for Notts County in April 2015 – she missed. Much of White’s goalscoring came from her ability to slip away from defenders as she played on the last shoulder. Time and again White would make runs to find herself somehow in acres of space as the ball was played into the box. Occasionally it made her seem like she was just a player who was in the right place at the right time, scoring simple goals but White’s intelligence was to use her movement to get into those positions. There was often a sense when White played that just because you knew what she was going to do, that did not help you stop her from doing it. No goal sums up her ability to do this better than her equaliser against the United States in the World Cup semi-final. With Beth Mead out on the left wing, White ghosted between Abby Dahlkemper and Becky Sauerbrunn, with her outstretched right foot redirecting Mead’s cross into the top corner. In fact, White scored again that game, but the goal was ruled out for a minuscule offside. The offside flag was a familiar one for White – no player has been ruled offside more in the history of the WSL (125 times) – particularly later in her career as her pace declined, but she still found ways to score goals. White will probably be best remembered as England Women’s all-time top scorer, and second on the overall list with 52 goals, just one fewer than Wayne Rooney. Her first ever England goal came at Loftus Road back in March 2010, where she scored against Austria in World Cup Qualifying. She scored regularly throughout the years when she was fit but it was the 2019 Women’s World Cup where she really had her breakout moment for England. White had played in international tournaments before but often alongside another striker, whether that was Kelly Smith, Eni Aluko or Jodie Taylor. Under Phil Neville, however, White became the de facto number nine for England and she repaid the favour by scoring in every single game as England reached the semi-final. Her six goals were not enough to win the Golden Boot as Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan had also scored as many and had more assists, but her contribution to the side was undeniable. Her iconic ‘glasses’ celebration, inspired by Anthony Modeste (White is a big fan of German football), made her instantly recognisable to the wider public who might have been watching women’s football for the first time. She was Team GB’s stand-out player at the Tokyo Olympics where she was a rare bright spark in a disappointing tournament. A hat-trick against Australia was not enough to get her side into the semi-finals but she showed why managers were so willing to continue to rely on her, even as other challengers for that starting striker spot abounded. That trust continued under Sarina Wiegman for whom she scored the record-breaking goal that saw her become the Lionesses’ all-time top scorer – fitting that it was as part of a hat-trick as England thrashed Latvia 20-0. White started every game at the successful 2022 Euros, scoring her final two goals for England in the 8-0 group stage win over Norway. No player under Wiegman’s tenure has a higher expected goals total than White with 14.6 xG from 18 games played, while only Beth Mead (20) has scored more goals in the period than her (13). Having lifted the European Championship trophy, White is undeniably going out on a high, her name firmly stamped in the record books.

11520,Euro 2022 Final Preview: The Key Factors Behind England’s Success,"England face Germany in the final of Euro 2022 on Sunday. Pre-tournament, our supercomputer gave the Lionesses’ a 33% chance of making the final at Wembley on Sunday. Five matches, 20 goals scored, and only one conceded later, they’ve made it. Things haven’t gone England way against Germany historically in Women’s football. Just two of the previous 27 meetings have been won by the English (21 by Germany). Despite the history, our pre-match predictor rates them as slight favourites for the title with a 52.5% chance of winning England’s first major international crown – men’s or women’s – since 1966. The Germans however have never lost a Women’s European Championship final, and they have plenty of experience having taken home the European title a record eight times. How did England make it this far? We look at four reasons behind England’s success at Euro 2022. One of the most interesting differences between England and Germany at this tournament has been their approach to pressing. England’s Opposition Passes Per Defensive Action average (PPDA) has been firmly mid-table throughout the tournament, averaging 10.8 whilst Germany have been one of the most intense pressing teams, with a PPDA of 8.4 – second only to Spain (7.5). Sweden for the most part kicked long against England, but when they did play it out from the back, England were generally happy to let Magda Eriksson progress with the ball until she began to approach the halfway line. In the picture below you can see that Beth Mead, who had been retreating towards her half, only looks to engage Eriksson once she approaches the mid-way point. This is in contrast with Germany who often position two players on the edge of the opposition’s areas, including occasional midfielder Lina Magull, in order to immediately press when the ball is back in play. Despite this difference in approaches to pressing, both England and Germany have recorded the two highest numbers of shot-ending high turnovers with 12 and 13 respectively with both teams scoring four goals because of their turnovers. In the final, we can expect both teams to be focusing on finding chinks in their opponent’s armour as they build up. Both teams like to build up from the back so there will be plenty of opportunity for each side to put the other under pressure. England have created the most open play chances from the right third of the attacking half of the pitch at Euro 2022 – more than finalists Germany (19) and losing semi-finalists France (24) and Sweden (17).  Therefore, it’ll come as little surprise that right winger Beth Mead and right-back Lucy Bronze have the second and third highest sequence involvement numbers with Mead having been involved in 32 shot-ending sequences and Bronze in 31. Generally, England like to build up along the left-side of the pitch before switching it over to the right to attack the area. Germany’s left back Felicitas Rauch has had a very impressive tournament, but England will certainly be looking to put her under pressure. Equally their left-sided centre-back Marina Hegering has supported Rauch well, making the most interceptions of any player at the tournament with 12. England manager Sarina Wiegman is nothing if not methodical so will likely have a number of other plans if England’s favoured attacking strategy is not offering as much joy. It is astounding how two of England’s standout players at Euro 2022 did not go to the Olympics as part of the Team GB squad. Neither Mary Earps nor Beth Mead travelled to Tokyo, with Carly Telford preferred as the experienced option in goal and Mead deemed not good enough. Yet both have had exceptional Championship tournaments. Beth Mead is facing a shootout for the Golden Boot against Alexandra Popp on Sunday with both players on six goals apiece. There is a sense of ‘anything you can do I can do better…” between those two, with Mead breaking records throughout the tournament and Popp equalling it the next day. In the semi-final against Sweden, Mead became the player to have scored the most goals ever in a Women’s European Championship, until Popp equalled her the next day with her two against France. However, Mead has not just been a scorer for England; she’s also been a key provider with three assists. Mary Earps, meanwhile, has shown her quality particularly in these knock-out matches against Spain and Sweden. Earps has currently only conceded one goal despite having faced an expected goals on target of 5.3. The distribution ability of Millie Bright and Leah Williamson in central defence have allowed her to focus on her shot-stopping. She got down smartly in the opening minute in the semi-final to save an early shot from Sofia Jakobsson with Williamson clearly knowing how crucial this save was for the Lionesses’ – when Alessia Russo scored England’s third a few minutes later, it was Earps who Williamson immediately ran too. The performances of both have shown the value in Wiegman coming in to reassess the pool of players at her disposal and being open-minded about who she wants to use. Both Earps and Mead tend to improve when they are feeling confident and Wiegman’s faith in them has paid dividends. It would be impossible to talk about this England team and not mention Wiegman’s super subs. Wiegman has used the same starting XI in every match this tournament and has used her substitutions almost identically as well. In all five matches, Ella Toone, Chloe Kelly and Alessia Russo have been brought on, normally around the 60-minute mark. Their impact has been undeniable, particularly Russo’s, who has scored four goals in five games off the bench. The more dynamic movement of Russo (in comparison to Ellen White) has made her tough to deal with for tiring opposition defenders whilst Chloe Kelly’s one-on-one ability makes her the perfect option as games drag on. Whilst there have been some calls for Russo to start ahead of White, the way Wiegman uses her substitutions makes it clear that these attacking partnerships have been worked on specifically for the final 30 minutes of matches. You only have to look at the disorganisation of France as they attempted to get a goal against Germany in their semi-final to see how making lots of random attacking changes can actually disrupt your team. The impact of Wiegman’s shows how well-rehearsed these substitutions are.

11524,Heading for Glory: The Aerial Battleground of Euro 2022,"Johan Cryuff has given us, among other things, some of the most recognizable quotes in football. One of them reads, “you play football with your head, and your legs are there to help you.” Now, this was aimed to be a quote about the importance of using your head to solve in-game situations on the fly, but let’s put our spin on it.  Using your head, in the very literal sense, is a valuable quality on the football pitch. Although heading the ball has been under scrutiny due to the micro-trauma it can cause and the long-term risks of concussion, even prompting discussions around whether removing heading the ball outside of the penalty boxes is an option, headers add a different dimension to a team’s offensive ideas. It’s a difficult skill to master and control but has been a mainstay of a team’s attacking principles. There has been a clear upward trend in the volume of headed shots at the ongoing Women’s Euros, with the number rising to 5.2 headed shots per game in the current edition in comparison to 4.3 per game in 2013. While teams have marginally improved on their headed shot volume, they have become significantly better at converting these shots into goals. The 2022 edition of the Euros has been a goalfest, with 85 goals scored at a rate of 3.04 goals per game. We have already witnessed 24 headed goals in this tournament, almost as many as the previous two editions combined (27) with three games remaining. This isn’t just a change in the raw volume of goals, the headed shots per goal figure has significantly gone down from 8.3 in 2013 and 8.6 in 2017 to just 6.0 in the current edition. Four teams from the current edition rank in the top six for headed goals scored at the Euros in the Opta database which dates back to the 2013 edition and the current edition is still ongoing. Germany have scored five goals from 17 headed shots in this year’s tournament while Spain have scored four from the same number of headed shots. Wolfsburg and Germany striker, Alexandra Popp, playing her first ever Euros after missing the earlier editions with unfortunate injuries, leads the chart for most goals from headers in the last three editions with three goals from seven headed shots. So what is happening here? Are teams getting better at generating headed opportunities and is it a part of some larger tactical trend? Are players simply better at heading the ball? Is it a height phenomenon? Let’s try to dissect it. The game is constantly evolving. Teams are getting better tactically with increased emphasis on possession play. Consequently the players are developing to be better on the ball in recent years. The increased investment in the women’s game has helped make up some lost ground. These advancements have helped level the playing field in some ways. Teams trying to gain a valuable edge on their opposition have come up with innovative solutions for goalscoring problems. One of the most prominent solutions has been the set-piece development. Teams have started to incorporate set-pieces as an important aspect of their game model and have come up with creative strategies to exploit the opposition’s shape. Excluding penalties, 26 out of 77 goals scored so far have come from set-pieces (34%). Of non-penalty shots, 55% of headed attempts at this year’s Euros have come from either corner or set-pieces. So set-pieces clearly matter, especially in international knockout style tournaments. At the current Euros, Iceland have been an example of this strategy. Ranked 16th in the world, Iceland accumulated the highest xG total from non-penalty set-piece situations in the tournament (3.61) and a whopping 72% of their total xG came from these set plays. They are at the top in the competition for most headed shots per game at 4.7, and a large portion of that is down to their excellent set-pieces and a secret weapon in their attacking repertoire – long throw-ins. Dagny Brynjarsdottir, known for her ability to pounce on these aerial balls in the box, is one of the main beneficiaries of this. Out of her 23 shots in the WSL last season, 11 of them were headers and she has recorded the most headed shots for Iceland at the Euros as well. Her height, standing at 5-foot-11, and uncanny awareness to attack the aerial balls makes her a consistent threat in the box. She averaged just over four aerial duels won per game at the Euros. In our preview for the Euros, we noted Sveindis Jonsdottir’s Rory Delap-esque long throw-ins as an important strategy for Iceland and the Nordic nation scored a goal from one of those long deliveries. Iceland’s setup on these long throw-ins is built around attacking the second ball either after an initial header or awkward bounce in the box. Look at the five players Iceland (in white) have ready at the far post to attack the second balls and in case nobody manages to get to it and the ball is bouncing in the box, they have a player situated right at the edge of the box to attack that, which is how the goal came about. These long throw-ins are agents of chaos in the box and it’s a rare trait in football, hence teams are often clueless when faced with them. Another team that has benefitted from maximizing their set-pieces is Portugal. Following their late inclusion into this year’s Women’s Euros, Francisco Neto’s side didn’t have much time to prepare coming in and focused their attention on designing an effective set-piece routine to compensate for what they lacked in other departments. Across the group stage, they accumulated the second highest xG from set-pieces at Euro 2022. In particular, their corner routine has been very effective and helped them pull off a comeback draw against Switzerland in the first game. Their setup allowed them to exploit near post and far post and a combination of good movements resulted in space in the middle for aerially dominant players like centre-back Diana Gomes. They switched things up from time to time by playing a cutback to the options at the edge of the box as well. The variety on offer in these situations was the spice of their attack. Set-pieces matter, and when devised strategically can help you gain edge over your opponent. Obviously when it comes to aspects like heading the ball, one can’t look past the role of height in winning these aerial battles. While jump timing and reach are important factors, height does play a decisive role in winning headers. This is just one of the reasons why players like Wendie Renard, Dagny Brynjarsdottir and Irene Paredes are so good in the air. Renard is a towering presence at 6-foot-2 while Paredes stands at 5-foot-8, defending against them in the box is easier said than done. Assigning multiple players on them opens up space for other players, so it’s a double edged sword. France veteran centre-back and captain, Renard is another example of this. She is renowned for her aerial ability. She is so good at it that she is the highest shot-taker at the Euros this year (17) with 76% of those shots being headers. Being so tall, she is easily the most recognizable target in the box from set-play and coupled with her ability to peel away from defenders into space make her very hard to defend against. France particularly try to facilitate this with some set-piece routine, where they remain tight to Renard as the ball is played in thus making it difficult for the opposition to mark her closely while keeping an eye on the ball.  Spain and Barcelona centre-back, Paredes, is another example of this. She recorded six headed shots in the tournament, fewer than only Popp (7) and Renard (13). Her height and reading of the game gives her an advantage in aerial duels, with the Spanish center-back having a 67% success rate on aerial battles. Another key physical factor in winning aerial duels is jump reach. Germany’s Alexandra Popp is a great example of this. At 5-foot-7, Popp isn’t a towering presence like Renard but she times her jump to perfection and her reach is excellent. She too has a 67% success rate on her aerial duels and three out of four of Popp’s goals so far have been from headers as well. Her jump reach and timing fused with her physicality make her an excellent outlet for route one football, allowing her to turn playmaker with flick-ons while helping her goal-scoring abilities. It’s a similar case with England and Manchester United’s striker, Alessia Russo, who stands at 5-foot-7 but her overpowering physical nature, jump and the ability to attack the aerial balls help her edge ahead of her marker. She has scored two goals from headers in the tournament and an example of how her aerial ability is helpful for her side was demonstrated by her role in the equaliser England scored against Spain in the quarter-finals. Spain has been among the teams with most headed shots at the tournament in the last two editions of the Women’s Euros. On the surface that might seem a little odd for a team renowned for their intricate and incisive passing on the ground to then score goals and get shots off in the form of headers. Four out of Spain’s six goals in the tournament have been headers. They are only marginally behind France (4.5) in terms of headed shots per game with 4.3 and they aren’t particularly a tall side either. So what is going on here? What seems like an anomaly on the surface, starts to make sense as you ruminate on it. Spain likes to keep the ball, their average possession in the last two editions has been 75.4% and 69.1% respectively, and teams are largely happy letting them do so. This presents itself as an interesting tactical puzzle on the pitch for Spain to solve.  As their playing style has become more refined in terms of on-ball principles, teams have increasingly set-up to deny them space in front of goal. They want Spain to keep possession in front of their compact shape and funnel them towards the wide areas. Jorge Vilda’s side thus find themselves working with space in the wide areas and by extension have to resort to crossing. Their number of open-play crosses per game has gone up from 15.5 in 2013 to 19.3 in 2017 to 21.5 in 2022, a figure that sits only behind France with 32 crosses per game in 2013 since this metric was first recorded in the tournament. Spain, even if it’s not the best use of the tools at their disposal, find themselves returning to crossing more often than not. Crossing, in general, isn’t always the most efficient way of attacking, with a shot every six crosses but a healthy 71% of those shots are headers, which makes sense given the aerial nature of most of these deliveries from out wide. Spain have averaged a shot every 5.9 crosses at the Euros this year and 81% of these shots are headers. Not really an efficient way even more so when you factor in that Spain at this tournament have mostly played without a recognised striker upfront to attack these deliveries on top of most of their striker options lacking the aerial prowess in the first place. With their on-ball and territorial dominance, Spain often find themselves attempting a very high volume of these crosses, thus presenting themselves with more opportunities to head the ball. So an anomaly? Well not quite.

11529,Lionesses Roar Into Next Round: But Can They Go All the Way?,"England made it out of their Euro 2022 group with even more ease than anyone expected. Our supercomputer gave them a 56.9% chance of topping it but a 1-0 win over Austria followed by a record-breaking 8-0 win over Norway ensured they topped the group with a game to spare. They finished it up with a 5-0 win over Northern Ireland, meaning they have had 100% records at back-to-back European Championships group stages, having also won all their games in 2017. England are the first team to do this since Germany, who managed it in 2001, 2005 and 2007. They’ve coasted through the group stage, breaking heaps of records along the way. But are they legitimate contenders to lift the trophy at the end of the month? We assess their title credentials. England have scored an incredible 14 goals in the group stage, the most ever by a team in one single group stage of the tournament. Their 8-0 win over Norway also broke their own record for the biggest win at a Women’s European Championship. And by following it up with a 5-0 win over Northern Ireland, they became the first team to score 5+ goals in consecutive matches at the Women’s Euros. Key to England’s goalscoring exploits has been Beth Mead, who we picked out in our Group Previews as a player to keep an eye on. She is currently the tournament’s top scorer having scored five goals from chances worth 2.6 expected goals. Only Ellen White has a higher xG from the tournament than the Arsenal player. Remarkably, Mead has scored from every shot on target she has had, and her five goals have entered her into a special group of players: England Lionesses to score 5+ goals at a major tournament: Jodie Taylor (2017 Euros)Ellen White (2019 World Cup)🆕 Beth Mead (2022 Euros)#WEURO2022 #Lionesses Part of what has made England so deadly is the difference in styles of play between their two wide players, Lauren Hemp and Mead. Whilst Hemp is more likely to take on a player one vs. one, Mead excels from her off-the-ball runs to receive passes. A case in point was her movement for her goal against Austria where Fran Kirby was able to flick the ball over the top of Austria’s defence for Mead to latch onto. Manager Sarah Wiegman has been happy to switch Hemp and Mead around as games have gone on to probe defences and see which full-back might provide the most joy for each of their styles of play. Kirby’s role in this side has also been important. Who Wiegman picked as her number 10 was one of the main selection question marks that England still had heading into the tournament. Given Kirby’s lack of game-time in the run up to Euro 2022 as a result of a fatigue issue, it was not entirely clear whether she would be ready to start. But Wiegman has put her trust in her and Kirby has come good, registering three assists so far in the tournament, more than any other player. She also scored the opener against Northern Ireland, breaking the deadlock against a stubborn defence, with a wonderful first-time shot from the edge of the area. England have also relied on Lucy Bronze for their attacks with the right-back returning to a level of performance not seen since her Lyon days. Bronze has rampaged up and down the right flank for England and has been involved in 26 shot-ending sequences of play – the joint highest in the tournament alongside Mead. Five of those have been goal-ending. Bronze has also created eight chances from open-play, a tally which only two players bettered in the group stages (Fran Kirby and Sara Däbritz – both nine). Whilst it’s clearly England’s goalscoring that has caught the eye, the Lionesses have also been incredibly defensively solid, keeping clean sheets in all three games. They have conceded an expected goals against total of only 1.2 across their three matches, the lowest in the tournament so far despite already playing three matches, and only five shots on target. Mary Earps has also been extremely dependable in goal. She currently has the best goals prevented figure of any keeper at the tournament, having faced 2.7 expected goals on target and conceding none. Having played Leah Williamson in midfield for almost the entirety of her tenure as England manager, Wiegman has since pushed her back into defence alongside Millie Bright, with Georgia Stanway instead paired alongside Keira Walsh. Williamson offers an extra passing option when she is sat behind Walsh, rather than alongside her, and has given Walsh the freedom to really express herself. Leah Williamson completed 117 passes tonight, the most of any player in a single #WEURO2022 game so far this tournament: pic.twitter.com/fRXFuD5h14 Meanwhile, Georgia Stanway has reined in her exuberance in midfield, which was a concern for a number of England fans. She has currently conceded only one foul at the tournament. Millie Bright has also lived up to her reputation as being a brick wall and has won seven of her eight aerial duels faced. England’s stylistic stats have perhaps been slightly skewed by the opposition they have played against. Their utter dominance in all three of their group games have not necessarily given us the best idea of how they might play in a knock-out fixture. Tellingly, England have pressed relatively little, recording a PPDA of 11.1, placing them firmly mid-table in relation to other teams at the tournament. England however have been utterly dominant at turning their high turnovers into shots and goals. They currently rank fifth for total high turnovers, with 10 shot-ending and four goal-ending ones. That is the most shot-ending high turnovers and double the number of goal-ending turnovers of any other side in the competition. Particularly noticeable is England’s variety in attack. They currently come second in terms of build-up sequences (51) behind Spain (59), with 15 of their open-play sequences containing 10+ passes and ending in a shot or touch in the box – again, behind only Spain (17). But they also come top in terms of direct attacks – open-play sequences that begin in their own half and have at least 50% of movement directly towards the opponent’s goal. Of the other teams in the top five for direct attacks, England are the only side to have more than nine build-up sequences. That varied style of player makes them a dangerous and flexible opponent, which is particularly useful in knockout football. Can they go all the way? Our tournament simulator certainly thinks they’re in with a great shout, giving them a 20.9% chance of lifting the crown. That’s fractionally ahead of Germany at 20.6%, and France out in third at 19.9%.  Whisper it quietly: it *might* be coming home.

11530,Predicting the Knockout Stages at Women’s Euro 2022,"The bad news: 77% of Women’s Euro 2022 has come and gone. The good news: the remaining 23% should be filled with all the chaotic thrills and spills that knockout football brings. But when the dust settles, who’ll be left standing? For us mortals, your guess is as good as ours. But fortunately, we can call upon the ordained power of the supercomputer to simulate the remainder of the tournament. Let’s look at the permutations. England Chance of Progressing: 55.3% Spain Chance of Progressing: 44.7% The juiciest of the quarter-final match ups is first on the docket, as free-scoring hosts England take on many people’s pre-tournament favourites Spain. But as we’ve outlined in our group stage reviews for the Lionesses and Jorge Vilda’s side – which give a more detailed breakdown of the teams – the two sides have had contrasting tournaments so far. England waltzed through their group, smashing records along the way. There was the solid, measured 1-0 opening win over Austria. The barmy 8-0 record-breaking win over Norway followed and a comfortable 5-0 victory against Northern Ireland rounded off their group stage work. 14 goals scored (the most of any team in the group stage at any Women’s Euros). No goals conceded (the first side to score 10+ goals while not letting in a single goal). Job. Done. England’s crop of exciting players are all finding form at the right time. The same can’t really be said for Spain. Question marks over Jorge Vilda’s management of the side, from personnel decisions to frequent positional changes, combined with the noticeable absence of Jenni Hermoso and Alexia Putellas who are out through injury, has meant Spain have struggled for rhythm so far in this tournament. In classic Spanish style, they are dominating their way to constant possession in their opposition’s half, but have been unable to create true clear-cut opportunities. Despite averaging the highest possession figure in the tournament so far (73.8%) and completing the most passes in the opposition half, their xG/shot value of 0.11 is the fifth-lowest of all teams. But for all Spain’s consistent inconsistency, the supercomputer has this match evenly poised. The two sides have played very similar styles of play so far, dominating the ball and staying patient in possession. Whether one side changes its approach (it surely won’t be Spain) will be fascinating to see. England are favourites to emerge though, and the supercomputer reckons they’ll be favourites against their semi-final opponents too. Speaking of, they’ll play the winner of… Sweden Chance of Progressing: 51.7% Belgium Chance of Progressing: 48.3% Officially the closest quarter-final tie of them all, this one is basically a coin flip. Sweden swanned into the knockouts in style with a 5-0 win over Portugal. That was Sweden’s joint-biggest win at the Women’s Euros, equalling their 5-0 victory over Finland at the 2013 tournament when they were hosts. Stina Blackstenius has been a constant threat up front, registering the highest expected goals total for her side (1.6) and she’s landed more shots on target than any other player so far in the tournament. She’s been supported by skipper Kosovare Asllani, who not only has three assists to her name already but has led Sweden’s high press from the front. Aslanni has won possession back in the final third almost six times per 90 (5.7), the highest rate of any player in the tournament. Sweden lead all teams in forcing high turnovers. For Belgium, this is all a new experience. In squeaking past Italy in their final group game, they’ve qualified for the knockout stages of the Women’s Euros for the first time. Unlike Sweden, Belgium defend in a lower block and start their attacks far closer to their own goal. Ives Serneels’ side have spread the load evenly in front of goal so far, with their six goals scored being bagged by five different players. Germany Chance of Progressing: 79.1% Austria Chance of Progressing: 20.9% On the other side of the draw, lurk the two leading favourites, France and Germany. Germany have an overwhelming shot at getting to the semi-finals, with the simulator predicting an almost 80% chance of them swatting aside Austria. Germany’s progress so far has been serene. Martina Voss-Tecklenburg’s side won all three of their group stage games without conceding a single goal. It’s the second time a German side has managed that, previously doing so in the 2005 edition. Their nine goals and 62 total shots so far are both only second to England, while Alexandra Popp is the second player – after England’s Beth Mead – to score in all three group stage games at Euro 2022. Popp has been ably fed by Germany’s supporting cast. Winger Svenja Huth has been particularly devastating, with her 2.0 expected assists from open play the highest of any player at the tournament so far, while only two players have created more chances than Klara Bühl’s 10. Austria will be stubborn though and do come into this fixture in really good form. They’ve won eight of their 10 matches across all competitions in 2022, scoring 29 goals while conceding just five in return. This tie will likely be attack versus defence, with Germany monopolising the ball and Austria sitting back. The Germans have completed a sequence consisting of 10+ passes on 25 occasions so far at the Euros. Austria have done that just five times. France Chance of Progressing: 67.1% Netherlands Chance of Progressing: 32.9% The final last eight tie sees our model’s favourites France in action. Les Blues are rated at 24.5% of winning the whole thing, and unsurprisingly are favourites to meet Germany in what would be a humdinger of a semi-final. Only England (12.9) registered a higher expected goals output than France in the group stage (9.3), with Grace Geyoro leading the way for both expected goals (2.1) and goals, with all three of hers coming in a first-half hat-trick in France’s opening game against Italy. In Women’s Euros history, that’s the first ever first-half hat trick we’ve witnessed. Delphine Cascarino has been a menace on the flank with her ball-carrying threat. Despite just playing a half against Iceland, no one in the tournament has created more team shots following a carry than the Lyon flyer. France will be cursing the fact they’ve got Germany in their side of the draw, or else that 24.5% chance of winning the trophy would be a lot higher.   Holders Netherlands have got their work cut out. There’s a likely chance their nine-match unbeaten run at the Women’s European Championships comes to an end here.   You can follow our tournament simulator live here.

11531,Women’s Euro 2022 Stats: The Group Stage Review,"The 24 group stage games at Women’s Euro 2022 are complete and we now know our final eight teams. We’ve already seen a record-breaking goal tally at these finals, but what else have we learnt from the action so far? We’ve seen 78 goals scored so far at the Women’s Euro 2022 tournament – that’s already a record in the competition’s history within a single edition. Granted, this edition is bigger than many of the previous iterations, with 24 games already played. However, only Euro 2005’s 3.33 goals per game is higher than the 2022 tournament (3.25) as it stands. Just over 10% of these goals were scored by England in their record-breaking 8-0 win over Norway on MD2, with Beth Mead helping herself to five overall in the group stage – a record by a player in the group stage at the Women’s Euros and just one off the record by a player in a single edition, set by Inka Grings in 2009. 5 – England’s Beth Mead scored five goals in the group stages of the 2022 UEFA Women’s Euros, a record total by a player in the group stage at a single edition of the Women’s Euros. Productive. pic.twitter.com/nWt2LsMGC3 The 2022 tournament has seen two goals scored within the opening minute of the match – Finland’s Linda Sällström against Spain (48 seconds) and France’s Melvine Malard versus Iceland (46 seconds). Before 2022, only two opening minute goals had been scored in the history of the competition – Karen Farley for England versus Germany in 1995 and Linda Medalen for Norway against Sweden in 1989. Despite such a deluge of goals, the data suggests we should have seen even more. The shots attempted at the 2022 finals so far have accumulated a total of 84.6 expected goals – between six and seven more than we’ve actually seen. One of the biggest culprits were Iceland, who finished just behind Belgium in the group stage and failed to qualify for the quarter-finals. It was in their game against the Belgians, which they drew 1-1, that they spurned better quality chances than any other team in a game at Euro 2022. That match saw Iceland score one goal from an xG total of three, including a penalty miss in the 33rd minute with the scores locked at 0-0. Had Iceland won this match – as they data suggests they probably deserved to – they would have made the quarter-finals at the expense of Belgium. The hero in that draw for Belgium against Iceland was goalkeeper Nicky Evrard, who saved Berglind Thorvaldsdottir’s first half penalty in the match.It wasn’t just in this game that she produced the finest performances, though – overall in the group stage, her 15 saves prevented 5.5 goals from being scored, based on our expected goals on target model (xGOT). That total was the most of any goalkeeper in the group stage, ahead of England’s Mary Earps (2.7), who is yet to be beaten at the tournament. Evrard saved her best performance for the final group stage game, a 1-0 win over Italy to secure their place in the quarter-finals. The six Italian shots that she faced on target had a total xGOT value of two, meaning her saves prevented Italy from scoring twice and possibly a 2-1 victory that would have seen them progress instead of her Belgian side. Based on the playing styles of England and Spain in the group stage of Euro 2022, their quarter-final encounter is going to be akin to a game of chess. When looking at the speed at which teams progress upfield with attacks against the average number of open play passes per sequence in the tournament so far, England and Spain stand out like a sore thumb. Both sides lead the way in terms of total number of open play passing sequences that have 10 or more passes – twice as many as the other teams – but there is a point to their possession dominance, as these eventually lead to shots or entries into the opposition box over 25% of the time (Spain: 28.8%, England: 29.4%). A fine example of this was England’s fourth goal against Northern Ireland in their 5-0 win. Alessia Russo’s second goal of the game wasn’t just beautiful for her immaculate turn and finish, but it also saw 16 passes in the build-up – no goal at Euro 2022 has seen a longer passing build-up leading up to it. The increase in quality that teams like England and Spain possess on the ball have shown just how far European national teams have progressed over the last decade. When comparing the last three Women’s European Championship tournaments, Euro 2022 leads the way in each of the passing metrics shown above. Euro 2017 actually saw a decrease from 2013, but this tournament has shown sides to be even more comfortable on the ball than the two previous editions. Whilst Spain were the favourites for many pre-tournament, our predictor didn’t fancy their chances of glory in England this summer as highly. Before a ball was kicked, we gave Spain an 8% chance of lifting the trophy at Wembley in 2022, and that was before star player Alexia Putellas was ruled out days before the tournament began with a long term injury. Even if our predictions are proved correct, and Spain don’t go on to lift silverware this summer, they can be buoyed by the fact that they have had the youngest starting XI on average during the tournament so far (26 years, 97 days). Maybe there is life without Putellas – who will be 29 years old when the 2023 Women’s World Cup is played next summer – and even Jennifer Hermoso (now 32). With the group stage now over, we’re left with the crème de la crème of women’s football in Europe.You’ll all have you views on what teams will make it through to the final four of the tournament, but what does our esteemed supercomputer think the outcome will be? The machine sees Germany’s route to the semi-finals as the easiest, with a meeting against neighbouring Austria in the quarters giving them a 79.1% chance of progression. Reigning champions the Netherlands face current supercomputer favourites France, with the French being given a 67.1% chance of sending the Dutch home. Is football coming home this summer? Well, the model isn’t sure about that, but tips the Lionesses to progress against Spain on Wednesday night (55.3%), while it thinks they are more likely to face Sweden (51.7%) in the semis than Belgium (48.3%).

11536,The Biggest Women’s Euro Wins,"England destroyed Norway 8-0 in Brighton at the Women’s Euro 2022 last night, but how does it rank among the biggest Women’s Euro wins in history? Early spoiler alert: it’s the biggest of all-time. England 8-0 Norway set the new record for the biggest margin of victory at a UEFA Women’s European Championship finals tournament, overtaking their own record from the 2017 edition.  Here, we look through each of the wins in tournament history by five or more goals. England 8-0 Norway – 11 July 2022England 6-0 Scotland – 19 July 2017Norway 5-0 Denmark – 30 June 1997Germany 5-0 Russia – 27 June 2001Sweden 5-0 Finland – 13 July 2013 England broke the European Championship record – both men’s and women’s – for the biggest-ever win in the history of the competition in their group stage game against Norway.The 8-0 victory over the 11th best team in women’s football based on the FIFA rankings saw five of the Lionesses’ grab a goal, including a hat-trick for Beth Mead and two goals for all-time top scoring England women’s star Ellen White. England’s eight goals came from an expected goals total of 6.90, with their 25 shots having an exceptional average xG of 0.28 – essentially meaning that the average shot conversion rate for each of their shots is historically 28%. Create great chances and goals will come. It was 6-0 at half-time, with those six goals already enough to equal the biggest margin of victory at a Women’s Euros. That score was the biggest half-time lead in the history of the competition, overtaking France’s effort from the previous night (10 July 2022) against Italy, where they led 5-0 at the break before the Italian’s reduced the deficit in the second half in their 5-1 defeat. The 8-0 win over Norway in 2022 broke England’s own tournament record at the Women’s European Championships, which originally stood at 6-0 when Mark Sampson’s side defeated rivals Scotland in their opening match of the 2017 tournament. Scotland were playing in their first major tournament, and this was far from an ideal debut. Ellen White can boast of being the only player to score in both of the biggest wins in the history of the Women’s Euros with a strike in this game, while Jodie Taylor was the star for England with three goals. Her hat-trick was the first at a Women’s European Championship finals since 2 July 1997, when France’s Angélique Roujas scored all three goals in a 3-1 group stage win over Russia. This 5-0 win for Norway over Denmark is best remembered for the individual performance of Marianne Petterson. Aged just 22 at the time, the Norwegian scored four goals – two in each half – and became the first player to score four times in a single match at a Women’s Euros. That record remains to this day. Germany enjoyed a 5-0 win over Russia in the 2001 Women’s Euros on the way to winning the title in their own country. Amazingly, this game was still 0-0 until the 43rd minute, when Bettina Wiegmann opened the scoring for the host nation. With the scoreline still only 1-0 at half-time, the Russians might have hoped for another shock result, after drawing with England 1-1 in their opening group game, but it wasn’t to be. Germany were rampant in the second period, scoring four more goals through Birgit Prinz, Maren Meinert and a brace from Sandra Smisek in the final 17 minutes. Sweden enjoyed a 5-0 win over Finland as hosts of the Women’s Euros in 2013. It was their second group game, following a 1-1 draw against Denmark in the opening match, with this 5-0 rout enough to help them top their group and qualify for quarter-finals, before eventually being knocked out by Germany in the semis – the German’s going on to win another tournament. Central defender Nilla Fischer scored Sweden’s opening two goals in this match, before the more likely source of goals – star forwards Kosovare Asllani and Lotta Schelin (two goals), put some gloss on the victory.

11541,The Need for Mead: England Start Euro Quest with a Win,"Who else but Beth Mead? In our Euro 2022 preview, Jesse Parker Humphreys highlighted the threat that Mead posed to England’s opponents this summer following an excellent Women’s Super League season at Arsenal. With her goal last night against Austria in England’s opening game of the tournament, Mead has now scored 15 goals in her 15 appearances for England since the start of 2021 – more than any other player. It took only 16 minutes for Mead to open the scoring for England, with Austria trailing for the remaining 74 minutes at Old Trafford. Despite reaching the semi-finals in the last edition of the UEFA Women’s Euros in 2017 – and playing extra time in two of their five games – this was not a position that Austria had ever found themselves in during a match in the competition before tonight. In that tournament, Austrian goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger saved 21 of the 22 shots on target she faced (95%). The 26-year-old conceded with just her second shot on target faced in this edition, but she was still able to frustrate the Lionesses in their attempts to increase their lead – the Arsenal ‘keeper made four saves in this match, with the pick being a stop to deny Mead and England a second goal late in the first half. Captain Leah Williamson put in an assured performance in central defence alongside Millie Bright – the pair completing more passes than any other players on the pitch (Williamson: 77, Bright: 73), proving that England will be comfortable building possession from the back this summer. Williamson’s passing range is something that’s often rated as one of her strongest attributes, and her ability to spray passes out wide and advance England forward via Rachel Daly was key – 18 of her successful passes were played to Daly in the left-back position. England started the 2017 Euros with one of the most dominant performances of the group stage, defeating Scotland 6-0 before their hopes of glory ended in disappointment with a semi-final exit to eventual winners the Netherlands – led by now-England boss Sarina Wiegman. For Wiegman, it’s now seven wins in seven European Championship matches as a head coach. This victory wasn’t as big as that win over the Scots five years ago, but it was arguably just as convincing against a tricky Austrian side. They’ve made a good start in proving that their tag as favourites this summer in our predictor is warranted.

11547,Women’s Euro 2022 Prediction: Who Will Win This Summer?,"• Our Women’s Euro 2022 Prediction sees England and France as the joint-favourites.• Germany and Sweden are both given a 15% chance of victory.• Reigning Champions Netherlands have a one-in-ten chance.• Spain are the outsiders among the favourites at 8%. A summer of football is upon us, and the preparations are in full swing. Teams are trying to one-up each other with creative and impactful squad announcement videos. Some have even commissioned a song for the tournament (it’s a bop, trust us). Irrespective of the preamble, Women’s Euro 2022 promises to eclipse its predecessors. As a football-mad country gears up to host its own carnival, the big question looms: who sits on the throne at the end? Will football come home this summer? Will Germany reclaim their crown? Will Spain finally deliver on their promise? With so many questions, we did what any normal person would do. We asked the supercomputer. Ah, a host nation with Sarina Weigman as the manager. That sounds familiar, doesn’t it? It’s a combination that has been fruitful in recent memory. Our supercomputer agrees with the omens, projecting England as having a 33% probability of reaching the final and a 19% chance to win it all based on 100,000 simulations of this tournament. Their record under the new manager is fantastic. The first 13 games of Wiegman’s tenure have resulted in 11 wins, two draws and one iconic Arnold Clark Cup win. Their most recent game against Netherlands was the first time they had gone behind in a game and they ended up winning 5-1. Add to that fact that, according to our Power Rankings, they’ve drawn the easiest group. England’s path to the final isn’t straightforward. While they are heavy favourites to win the group, the proximity to Group B means trouble. If they win their group, they will then face whoever finishes second in Group B, likely to be one of Spain or Germany, both tough opponents that they came up against recently in the Arnold Clark Cup. Our predictor has Germany (80%) ahead of Spain (69%) when it comes to progressing to the quarter-finals. If England get past that hurdle, they will face the winners of Group C/runners-up of Group D, likely to be Sweden in this case. A high stakes game against the Swedes might bring back the trauma of the FIFA Women’s World Cup in 2019. While the signs leading up to the tournament are increasingly positive, the history isn’t. The last time England hosted the Women’s Euros they got knocked out in the group stage – even if it was an eight-team tournament in 2005. England’s best finish at the Euros came in the inaugural edition of the competition in 1984, when they lost to Sweden in the final on penalties. It was a very different time – halves were 35 minutes long for starters. But the supercomputer is not superstitious. It does not believe in ghosts of the past. And so it puts England as joint-favourites once the ball starts rolling on 6 July. France, the other favourites for the tournament according to our prediction model, are placed in a supposedly manageable group alongside Italy, Belgium and Iceland. That said, Group D has the lowest spread in our Power Rankings model between its teams of any group, as well as the lowest overall Power Rankings average (the lower the rank the better), suggesting things are poised quite delicately. Our Power Rankings model really likes this French side, with Corinne Diacre’s team ranked second in world football. Barring any slip ups, Les Bleues are touted as heavy favourites to win the group and will likely encounter the runners-up from Group C’s quartet of Sweden, Netherlands, Switzerland and Portugal. That leaves Italy, Belgium and Iceland to compete for that runners-up spot. Italy currently lead the pack with a 53% chance to get past the group stages, while Belgium and Italy have a 33% and 32% chance respectively. With this said, the supercomputer is cold and unfeeling towards the internal issues that have plagued Les Bleus ever since their home World Cup. There’s been visible friction between the veterans and manager Diacre, eventually culminating win Amandine Henry and Eugénie Le Sommer, two senior stars of the team, dropping completely out of favour. With an injury scare to Grace Geyoro as well, things look a little bleak in midfield. France’s preparation for the tournament is focused on building momentum rather than testing their steel, with two friendlies planned against lowly-ranked Vietnam and Cameroon. Time will tell whether France can put their internal struggles aside and come together when it really matters. Part of the reason why Germany and Spain, two of the favourites to win the tournament among the general public, don’t have the best odds is our model is because of the relative difficulty of their groups. Depending on how you define “Group of Death”, one could argue Group B, featuring the quartet of tournament favourites Germany and Spain alongside last edition’s runners-up, Denmark, and Finland, is one of them. Germany are no strangers to winning the Euros, having lifted the trophy a record eight times. In fact, 2017 was the first time they failed to reach the semi-final stage of the competition since 1995, winning it six times back-to-back over that time. Germany have the best odds in Group B for progressing to the knockout stages, higher than Spain’s. Beyond the group stage, if Germany manage to top their group, their next opponent would be the runners-up of Group A, the weakest group on paper. That’s an evidently manageable quarter-final tie. Getting through that will likely see them face our tournament favourites, France, in the semi-final. The odds for each of those teams progressing to the final are pretty even, with France given a 32% chance while Germany are projected at 27%. The talent pool at Germany’s disposal has left sometimes them visibly confused when deciding their strongest line up, something which hasn’t always worked in their favour. Their record against the top 10 international sides in the past 18 months doesn’t incite much confidence either with Martina Voss-Tecklenburg’s side losing to France, Netherlands and England in this period and managing a draw against Spain at the Arnold Clark Cup. Another much-fancied team, Spain, find themselves in a similar boat. This squad comes into the tournament with a lot of hype behind it, particularly with the players’ domestic performances. Just as some of the most successful Spanish men’s teams did, this squad also features a core from a dominant Barcelona side. Unfortunately, Spain have also garnered a reputation of being notoriously inefficient in front of goal when it matters. Failing to win the group would see them face the winners from group A, likely to be England, in the first knock-out round. It’s a matchup capable of being the final. Get through that and Sweden await in the semi-finals. Those are two extremely tough encounters, and that’s borne out in their 17% chance of reaching the final. Jorge Vilda’s side have been the great pretenders at the international stage – bags of talent but lacking execution. Pernille Harder’s Denmark side were runners-up in 2017, coming very close to lifting the silverware. They find themselves in a battle of the heavyweights in Group B but will love a repeat of 2017 where their run to the final included defeating Germany with a late goal in the quarter-finals.  Given how tough their group is, the supercomputer doesn’t like their chances though, with the Danes projected a 5% chance of making it to the finals and just a 2% chance of going one better than in 2017. With a third-place finish at World Cup 2019 and a runners-up medal at the Olympics, Sweden are the perennial bridesmaids of international football. One could argue the super Swedes deserve a winners medal for their performances in those competitions but glory has evaded them ever since their victory in the inaugural edition of this competition. A group with holders Netherlands alongside Switzerland and Portugal shouldn’t be much of a hassle for the Blaglut, with our model assigning them an 80% chance to advance to the quarter-finals and a 48% chance to make it to the final four. The Swedes will hope to push beyond a mere podium finish though, and the supercomputer suggests there a 15% chance of that happening in the summer. The Netherlands have excelled in the last two major international tournaments. They won the 2017 Euros in front of a home crowd, before reaching the final of the World Cup two years later. They were in their golden period, but things haven’t gone to plan since then. The Dutch lost their manager Weigman and were recently handed a 5-1 beating by her new team and tournament favourites, England. Their group is manageable with our prediction model giving the Orange Lionesses a 71% chance to advance to the quarter-finals. Defending the crown however seems a tough task. Unless they finish top of the group, they are likely to encounter France and Germany/Spain en route to the final, three other title contenders. Avoiding big teams is impossible in a 16-team tournament and they will have to run the gauntlet to win this summer. Our supercomputer gives a 10% chance of that happening. Two-time champions, Norway, have been bolstered further in attack following the return of Ada Hegerberg. They will be eager to shake off the disappointment from 2017, where they exited in the group stage losing all three games while scoring zero goals. Martin Sjögren’s side have underperformed at the international stage, but the talent pool is as stacked as it could be, at least in the attacking department. While Norway are the second most likely team to advance to the quarter final stage from group A (61%), Austria are very much capable of spoiling the party again. Sjögren’s side’s path in the knockouts is a difficult one as well. Finishing second would see them face the winners of group B in the quarter-finals, one of Spain or Germany, a task easier said than done. Football is synonymous with hope. Hope that on a given day, for those 90 minutes, nothing else apart from the scoreline matters. Whether you have the historical pedigree, the form, the numbers, it all comes down to 90 minutes. That’s when magic happens. In 2017, debutants Austria topped a group that had France in it. Their semi-final run included zero losses in normal time. A failed World Cup qualification followed but since then they have earned a reputation of being a solid team capable of causing problems to any side. Laura Feiersinger was a centre-piece last time and they will be hoping to recreate some of that magic again. Irene Fuhrmann’s side are projected a healthy 40% to progress to the quarter-final stage, upsetting one of England or Norway. While Italy’s men’s side failed to qualify for the World Cup in 2018 their female counterparts made history by qualifying for the 2019 edition following a 20-year absence. Placed in Group D, with France, Iceland and Belgium, Luigi Bertollini’s side will be looking to go one better than 2017 and as far as possible. Le Azzure are predicted to have a 53% chance of advancing to the quarter-finals with a one-in-four chance to reach the semi-final stages. So, the supercomputer decrees that football might be coming home this summer. We have just over a week to wait before we get to find out how that journey might begin. Stats Perform’s Women’s Euro Prediction model estimates the probability of each match outcome (win, draw or loss) by using betting market odds and Stats Perform’s team rankings. The odds and rankings are based on historical and recent team performances. The model considers the strength of opponents and the difficulty of the “path to the final” by using the match outcome probabilities with the composition of the groups and the seedings into the knockout stages. It then simulates the remainder of the tournament thousands of times. By analysing the outcome of each of these simulations, the model returns the likelihood of progression for each team at each stage of the tournament to create our final predictions.

11550,"DACH Demands: The Expectations for Germany, Switzerland and Austria at Women’s Euro 2022","The trio of German-speaking countries have different expectations when it comes to Women’s Euro 2022, with the two smaller nations being simply proud to be a part of it all. For Germany, it’s either championship or bust. Germany are the European juggernaut of women’s football, having won eight of the 12 previous editions of the UEFA European Championships. The 2022 event, however, is the first since 1995 where the German side are not defending champions. The 2017 tournament saw the Germans disappoint, with the record champions falling to eventual finalists Denmark at the quarter-final stage (2-1) – the first time that they’d ever failed to reach the semi-finals of the tournament. Germany had progressed through a tricky group containing Sweden, Russia and Italy without a single defeat, and then made the perfect start against the Danes with a third-minute goal from Isabel Kerschowski. However, two goals in the second half for Denmark – including a winner with just seven minutes remaining – sent Germany home despite them controlling the game for large periods. Now, five years on and after a close-to-impeccable qualifying campaign where they won every single match whilst conceding just once overall (with 46 goals scored), Martina Voss-Tecklenburg’s side has something to prove in England this summer and will no doubt be in with a strong shout of picking up the title at the end of July. Still, Germany are not going into the tournament with the highest confidence. In February, they played in the Arnold Clark Cup, a preparational tournament for the main event in England, losing 3-1 to England and drawing 1-1 with Spain, both of whom are fellow contenders for the Euro title next month. Just as worrying for the Germans, they’ve lost against other women’s football powerhouses France (1-0 in June 2021) and the Netherlands (2-1 in February) over the last 18 months. Their lack of success against the bigger nations of European football in this period is a concern heading into a tournament where it’s impossible to avoid a top side if they want to go far. Germany’s group is highly competitive with meetings with Spain, Finland and an opening game against Denmark providing a tough examination on their credentials for European success. Yet, a lot has been made of Germany’s problems before major tournaments in the past, only for them to brush any pre-tournament worries aside with an assured performance in the finals. Back home, it’s been made clear that anything short of a final appearance for the Germans this year would be an underwhelming outcome for the fifth-best ranked team in the world. One player that Voss-Tecklenburg will be relying on this summer is Lea Schüller. Since the 2017 Euros, she is Germany’s leading goalscorer (25 goals at the time of writing) and finished as the Bundesliga top scorer in 2021-22 with 16 goals. In the last European Championship finals, Germany fired in more shots than any other team (91) but only scored five goals at a conversion rate of 5.5%. A proficient striker this summer would be most welcome. A nation with much lower expectations next month are southern neighbours Switzerland. After failing to qualify for any of the first 11 editions of the Euros, they are taking part in the tournament for the second time in a row. Their qualification for the finals was a great achievement in itself, taking a dramatic penalty shootout in their play-off meeting with the Czech Republic to reach England this summer. This came following a 4-0 defeat to Belgium in their final qualifier in Group H, when a win would have taken them directly to the Euro finals. Despite it being their first-ever European Championship finals appearance, there’s an argument to say that Switzerland underperformed at Euro 2017. The Swiss won all eight of their qualifiers for the tournament to top the group with a perfect record, including two wins against Italy, and were realistically set for a knockout stage finish. They were ranked higher in the FIFA rankings (17th) than group stage opponents Austria (24th) and Iceland (19th), but defeat to Austria and a failure to win against France in their final group game (1-1), despite the French playing with 10 players for 73 minutes, saw the Swiss go home with a whimper. The Swiss didn’t have issues with converting chances – only four teams converted a higher proportion of chances at the tournament than they did (13%) – but it was the lack of chance creation that hindered them. Only three nations attempted fewer shots in the group stage than they did (23), with just one of those being deemed a big chance. If they are to have more attacking success in this tournament, it’ll be vital that record scorer Ana-Maria Crnogorcevic (67 goals) and Paris Saint-Germain’s Ramona Bachmann – the only players to have scored at their last two international tournament appearances in 2015 (World Cup) and 2017 (Euros) – are given the opportunity to showcase their finishing ability in front of goal. Expectations for 2022 are more modest than five years ago, given the fact that they’ll have to face former Euro champions Sweden (1984) and the Netherlands (2017) in the group stage – who both occupy a spot in the current top four of the FIFA rankings – while Switzerland have never won a competitive match against either nation (five losses without a single goal versus Sweden and two defeats against the Dutch). As a result, the feeling is that anything more than a victory against Portugal would be deemed a success in England this summer. Unlike Germany and Switzerland, Austria exceeded expectations in the 2017 European Championships by reaching the semi-finals before being knocked out by losing finalists Denmark, on penalties. Considering they’d never before qualified for a Euro finals before 2017 and came into that tournament as the third-lowest ranked side in the world (24th), their semi-final finish came as a surprise to many. After that performance five years ago, Austria are the only team to have never lost a European Championship match in regulation time and are the team with the lowest goals conceded per game ratio in the competition (0.2), after only conceding a single goal in 2017 (1-1 vs. France). Expectations may be higher this summer, with the Austrians qualifying with only one defeat and seven clean sheets in their eight games to reach Euro 2022. Still, repeating that success will be a tall task. They enter a group stage alongside the hosts England and two-time European champions Norway. Those are difficult opponents in themselves, even before the added issue that Austria have never beaten either side before (W0 D0 L7 vs. England and W0 D1 L4 vs. Norway). Their hopes of unlikely success probably hinge on their solid defence, which conceded just three goals in eight qualifiers for this tournament – all of those coming away in France. In 2017 their defence was key to that semi-final finish, with Austria conceding the fewest goals (one) and keeping four clean sheets in five games – only the Netherlands could match that tally. Goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger – now of Arsenal – made a name for herself with her fantastic performances at the 2017 tournament and will be a key performer for the Austrians once again this summer.

11551,Women’s Euro 2022: One Player to Watch From Each Nation,"The biggest event of the summer is on the horizon as Women’s Euro 2022 kicks off in England on 6 July. The rescheduled tournament promises to be a bigger spectacle than ever before, boasting larger crowds and bigger media coverage than any of its predecessors. The 16-team tournament will showcase some of the world’s best footballers, with the likes of Ada Hegerberg, Pernille Harder, Vivianne Miedema and Alexia Putellas all competing for the bragging rights in Europe. Now, those are clearly superstar names. And while our guide will focus on some of the obvious stars, it will also shine a light on several understated yet extremely important players representing their nations this summer.  So, here’s one player from each country who could prove to be a difference maker for their team at Women’s Euro 2022. Group A: Lauren Hemp (England) • Simone Magill (Northern Ireland) • Sarah Zadrazil (Austria) • Guro Reiten (Norway) Group B: Svenja Huth (Germany) • Athenea del Castillo (Spain) • Pernille Harder (Denmark) • Emma Koivisto (Finland) Group C: Jill Roord (Netherlands) • Inês Pereira (Portugal) • Fridolina Rolfö (Sweden) • Lia Wälti (Switzerland) Group D: Marie-Antoinette Katoto (France) • Barbara Bonansea (Italy) • Justine Vanhaevermaet (Belgium) • Sveindís Jónsdóttir (Iceland) The formula for success in recent Euros history has been simple. Step 1: you are the host nation. Step 2: you have Sarina Weigman as your manager. England come into this tournament checking both of those boxes. The omens are good but you need more than just that to win a tournament. Luckily for them, the Lionesses seem to have the tools for it as well. After winning the PFA Women’s Young Player of the Year award for a record fourth time, Lauren Hemp is ready to be the difference-maker for England. The electric winger is one of the most impactful players in world football, capable of disrupting a stubborn defensive block with her excellent dribbling ability. The left-winger loves attacking the opposition full-back, running at them before leaving them for dead with her pace. Hemp is one of those rare players that seems to get faster with the ball at her feet. Her ability to carry the ball makes her a very adept ball progressor who constantly threatens the box. In the Women’s Super League last season, she carried the ball more frequently than any other attacking player, recording 16 carries per 90. Crucially, she runs at players in dangerous areas of the pitch. No player attempted as many take-ons in the opposition half as Hemp last season, and no one carried the ball into the box more often than the Norfolk winger. The end product from her dribbling is elite. Hemp created 29 chances following a ball carry in the WSL last year, 16 more than the next highest player (Arsenal’s Beth Mead). Combine that with her 17 shots following carries, and she recorded more chance-creating carries (46) than anyone else in the WSL. In the 2021-22 season, she shouldered much of City’s attack and finished the season as their top goalscorer (11). Apart from being a threatening presence, Hemp is an excellent progressive outlet, regularly enabling a switch of play with her wide positioning close to the touchline. Despite playing at her first major international tournament, Hemp is set to be a decisive player for Weigman’s side. Back to player list Northern Ireland are debutants at this year’s Women’s Euros. They enter the tournament as minnows and will be looking to ruffle feathers in a similar vein to their European qualification. Liverpool forward/midfielder Rachel Furness, who is the top goalscorer for the country, was pivotal in securing Northern Ireland’s qualification and will again be key this summer. Another player who will be vital for Kenny Shiels’ side, will be the 27-year-old forward, Simone Magill. Magill, who announced that she will leave Everton at the end of June after a nine-year stint, was the first Northern Irish woman to turn full-time professional in 2017. Having made her senior international debut at just 15, Magill has become a crucial part of her side, amassing over 50 caps while scoring 17 times for the national team. The Magherafelt-born forward holds the record for the fastest international goal in women’s football, scoring after just 11 seconds against Georgia in 2016. Magill is an extremely hard-working forward. She is quick, allowing her to close down opposition players and intercept passes, while she presses intensely to help her side recover possession high up the pitch. Her pace also allows her to recover loose balls following defensive duels. Magill’s work rate and engine allow her to tirelessly contribute on the defensive side of the game. Another key facet of her game is her physicality. The Northern Irish player has the strength to hold off physical challenges while retaining possession. This trait allows her to hold possession and bring other players into the game while also giving her an edge in physical 1-v-1 duels. Beyond her off-ball contributions, Magill has quality on the ball as well. She is great at receiving the ball on the half-turn, allowing her to spin and thread passes in behind for her team-mates. The weight on her through balls is often excellent and she has the vision to find runners with her passes. Voted as Everton’s Player of the Year in 2019, Magill will be looking to pull off some heroics in the summer. Back to player list Austria will be looking to go one better than their debut campaign in 2017, where they bowed out as one of the top four sides. They find themselves against hosts England, a Norway side bolstered by the return of Ada Hegerberg and debutants Northern Ireland. The squad is blessed with some really talented players in Laura Feiersinger, who was arguably the standout performer of the tournament last time out, Nicole Billa, the 2021 POTY for Austria and Manuela Zinsberger, who has enjoyed a splendid season in goal for Arsenal. Irene Fuhrmann’s side have proven to be a stern test for any opponent. Sarah Zadrazil, a perennial miracle worker in the shadows, will be key in the middle of the park. Bayern Munich’s understated midfielder is instrumental in winning the ball back for her side. She is solid in her defensive duels, and her ability to read the game allows her to regularly intercept opposition passes, providing strong defensive coverage and breaking down opposition attacks before they build. The defensive midfielder is among the best at recovering possession, while also capable of keeping things moving with her ball circulation. For Bayern Munich’s Champions League campaign, only Saki Kumagai started more open-play sequences than the Austrian midfielder (103), while nobody from the Bavarian team won more tackles (2.5) or won the ball back in the centre of the park (6.6) more often per 90 minutes.  She regularly occupies great areas and creates close passing combinations during Bayern’s build up and progression phase, helping her side move the ball into the attacking third. She is an adept distributor as well, capable of finding targets over medium and long ranges. While she might not receive the plaudits for scoring goals or creating chances frequently, Zadrazil is an anchor, offering balance and stability to her team. Back to player list Norway are a team stacked with attacking talent. All eyes will be on the return of the first-ever women’s Ballon d’Or winner, Ada Hegerberg, to the national team setup. Partnering Hegerberg up front is arguably the best winger in world football, Barcelona’s explosive Caroline Graham Hansen. Amongst this star-studded front line is a muted gem that often goes unnoticed. Guro Reiten, the Chelsea winger/wing-back, is Norway’s golden girl. Playing her club football for Chelsea, her time at the London club has seen her transform from a goalscoring forward and attacking midfielder to a wide creator and wing-back, without any significant drop in her performances. Reiten is blessed with a wand for a left foot, and being deployed as a wing-back has allowed her to showcase her incredible crossing ability. In the 2021-22 WSL season, only Lauren Hemp attempted more open-play crosses (81) than the 27-year-old (60), while no player surpassed her 19 successful open-play crosses. Her ability on the ball allows her to dribble past players to create space before whipping crosses into the box. Reiten’s exceptional delivery also means she’s frequently deployed on wide free kicks and corners, as she can deliver pinpoint balls into the box.  The Norweigan’s creativity and ball-carrying ability allows her to attack space and create shots for her team-mates. Only Hemp, Mead and Leah Galton, recorded more carries ending in a chance for a team-mate than Reiten’s nine in the WSL last year, and the Chelsea flyer is also an adept creator all over the pitch. Among players to play more than 900 minutes last campaign, only Beth Mead (0.33) recorded a higher open-play expected assist (xA) value per 90 than the Norwegian (0.28 xA per 90) in the WSL. Reiten’s ability to work in tandem with the players around her will complement Norway’s attack well and with Hegerberg back in the mix, Guro’s crossing could prove to be even more lethal. The stage is set for Norway’s golden girl to shine brighter than ever. Back to player list Germany are serial winners when it comes to the Women’s Euros. Such is their continental dominance that the 2017 edition was the first time since 1993 that a team not named Germany lifted the trophy. Martina Voss-Tecklenburg’s side will be looking for their record ninth Women’s Euros title to extend their lead as the most successful nation in the competition. The Germans have continued to produce elite talent on a regular basis across multiple positions, reaping the rewards of their hard work at the youth level. A new-look Germany side will boast mercurial talents like Klara Bühl, Jule Brand and Lena Oberdorf but a player who will form the spine of the squad is 31-year-old Svenja Huth. Huth was recently voted as the 2021-22 Player of the Season in Germany, ending the domestic season with 16 direct goal involvements and a league-leading 12 assists. An extremely agile winger, she is perfectly capable of playing on either flank or through the middle.  When playing on the right, Huth tends to cut back onto her dominant left and looks to play penetrating passes into the box. She is blessed with quick feet and acceleration, allowing her to twist and turn away into space to deliver a line-breaking pass or take a shot. Only team-mate Tabea Waßmuth (10) had more shots following a ball carry than Huth (nine) in the UWCL.  The Wolfsburg forward is a massive goal threat in and around the box, capable of curling one in from the edge of the area, or arriving late at the far post to score. Her positioning in the final third between lines helps disrupt opposition defensive structure, and when she gets on the ball she is a very adept creator. Huth created the most chances for Wolfsburg in the 2021-22 UWCL (16). The above chance map shows her propensity to slice open the defence with her passing from the right half-space. From that spot on the pitch, she has the vision and skill to play a variety of passes, from floated crosses to driven through balls. She is one of Germany’s most in-form players at the moment and has a knack of performing when the moment calls for a player to step-up. Back to player list Spain have earned a reputation as one of the best national sides in the world in recent years. Their strong performances since 2019 have seen them climb up to seventh in the FIFA rankings, ahead of the likes of England and Norway. They will be looking to improve on their performances in 2013 and 2017, where they were knocked out in the quarter-finals on each occasion.  Much of Spain’s core is based around Barcelona’s players. The current Ballon d’Or winner, Alexia Putellas, together with Aitana Bonmatí and Mapi León are all at the forefront of Spain’s charge at the tournament. In a squad filled with technically and tactically sound players, Athenea del Castillo stands out for her sheer ability to produce edge-of-the-seat moments whenever she gets the ball. The Cantabria-born youngster is a live-wire on the ball. The former Deportivo winger is capable of playing on either flank, offering different qualities while doing so, cutting inside to shoot or threading penetrative passes on one side while attacking the box and the byline on the other. She is extremely skillful on the ball, and has a penchant for nutmegging her opponents to dribble past them. This close control allows her to evade multiple players while helping her side progress into dangerous areas of the pitch. Despite Madrid getting to just the quarter-finals in the Women’s Champions League earlier this year, Athenea recorded 18 ball carries that included a take-on. Only four players tallied more over the course of the tournament. No player attempted more dribbles than Del Castillo (52) in this season’s UWCL, tied with Delphine Cascarino of Lyon, and on a per 90 basis, her 8.5 attempted dribbles were two more than next best Caroline Graham Hansen (6.3). She is fondly referred to as “Regathenea” for her proclivity to dribble past her opponents. Her pace and quick feet mean she is extremely hard to deal with and often the only way for opponents to stop her is to foul her. No player was fouled more often following an attempted take-on (three) than the 21-year-old in the UWCL, while only Beth Mead was fouled more frequently in the final third in the competition.  These qualities make her capable of wreaking havoc against set defensive structures and give her the ability to produce moments of individual magic. The Real Madrid winger is sure to drop more bodies and snatch more souls at Women’s Euro 2022. Del Castillo was recently voted as the Player of the Tournament at the Arnold Clark Cup and looks set to have a breakout tournament in England. Back to player list The runners-up at the previous edition will be hoping to work the same magic at the 2022 edition with their captain, Pernille Harder, at the forefront of their efforts once again. Grouped along with Spain, Germany and Finland, the task at hand will be easier said than done though. Harder is often hailed as one of the best women’s footballers of all-time, having won the UEFA Women’s Player of the Year in 2018 and 2020, and winning the Danish Player of the Year award a record seven times. Harder is a player that is hard impossible to ignore. Having joined Chelsea in 2020, Harder has enjoyed a lot of domestic success in England. In 2021-22, Harder won a domestic treble with Chelsea, despite them failing to progress past the group stages at the UWCL. She has demonstrated the versatility to play as a deeper or more advanced midfielder, being malleable according to her team’s needs.  The 29-year-old is often hailed as one of the most technically sound footballers you’ll find. She has a silky first touch and her ability in tight spaces is immaculate.  One of Harder’s main strengths lies in her ability to drive forwards with the ball. She is extremely proficient at bringing the ball out from midfield and using her runs to break opposition lines and help propel her side up the pitch. Harder’s powerful forward runs from midfield are a major driving force for her teams. No Chelsea player carried the ball farther forward on average than the Dane (8.1m per carry) in the WSL last season. She has the vision to convert these carries into chances for her team-mates, too. For Chelsea, only Erin Cuthbert (20) was involved in more chance-creating carries than Harder (18). Among players with more than 900 minutes in last year’s WSL, Harder ranks sixth for open-play chances created per 90 with 1.95, despite operating from deeper areas frequently. Harder will be looking to power her nation to yet another successful Euros in England. Back to player list Finland are the underdogs in amongst the heavy hitters of Group B. Despite being the lowest-ranked nation in the group, they aren’t pushovers and have demonstrated their abilities in the recent World Cup qualifiers. The return of Linda Sällström, who finished the qualification round as joint-second top scorer with 10 goals, has offered them a boost ahead of the challenges that await. Emma Koivisto, Brighton’s left full-back, is a player that promises to be an integral part at the tournament. The 26-year-old fits the mould of a modern full-back and is versatile enough to play in any role on the left flank, providing offensive and defensive coverage. She has experience of plying her trade in Sweden and the USA, where she played collegiate soccer for Florida State University, before joining Brighton & Hove Albion. Koivisto is a physically robust and industrious full-back that likes to get on the ball and join the attack at every opportunity. She’s heavily involved in Brighton’s all-round play, registering 51.7 touches per 90 minutes, behind only fellow full-back Maya Le Tissier (64.8) and Emma Kullberg (58.0) Her advanced runs make her a useful receiving outlet in the final third. From here, Koivisto can create chances and get into the box. For Brighton, she ranks second for both touches in the attacking third (303) and penalty box (45), underlining her offensive tendencies. In attack, she likes to take a player on and beat them before swinging a delivery into the box or attack the box herself to be on the end of a pass. For Brighton, no player has attempted more dribbles (42) than the Finnish international. She is physically robust in her duels, reads the play well to disrupt opposition attacks and has great recovery pace to help her get back in position. Her tireless nature makes her an integral part of the pressing structure as well. Koivisto will be important in keeping the flank in check while providing support in attack. Back to player list The Netherlands come into this tournament with the added baggage of defending their title. They have lost the manager that won the European Championship in 2017 and under whom they finished as runners-up at the 2019 FIFA World Cup, but Mark Parson’s side have the tools to challenge the elite in women’s football. Arsenal’s Vivianne Miedema, the all-time Dutch top scorer (men’s or women’s), is the obvious headliner alongside former Barcelona winger, Lieke Martens, but there’s a former Arsenal player who might prove to be a difference-maker for the Orange Lionesses. Jill Roord, who moved to Wolfsburg from Arsenal in the summer, has enjoyed a prolific campaign in front of goal, scoring 10 times, her best return since 2016-17, while assisting another five in the league. She scored another six in the UWCL. Roord won the domestic double with the German giants, slotting into the side seamlessly. Manager Tommy Stroot’s deployment of Roord in the false nine role allowed her to operate in areas where she can maximise her qualities. This positional freedom enabled her to get on the ball in between the lines and allowed her to benefit from excellent awareness in and around the 18-yard box, often arriving into the box with late attacking runs. She worked in perfect symphony with team-mate Tabea Waßmuth, often interchanging positions with her. These dynamic movements were a source of major threat for Wolfsburg this season. This change also got her involved in the thick of things in the final third. In the UWCL for Wolfsburg, only Waßmuth had more unique involvements in shot-ending sequences from open play (56) than the Dutch midfielder (54), with seven of these sequences ending in a goal. Heading into the tournament, Roord could prove to be the trump card for the Orange Lionesses. Back to player list Portugal, who are set to make their second appearance at the Women’s Euros, qualified for the tournament in unconventional means. They replaced Russia, who beat them 1-0 on aggregate in the play-offs, following their suspension from all European competitions. Despite losing one of Portugal’s prominent figures in Cláudia Neto, they still have some really exciting young talent in attack in the form of Jéssica Silva and 19-year-old Francizca Nazareth. Facing stern tests in the form of Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland, Francisco Neto’s side will be looking to throw a spanner in the works while frustrating teams, just like in the previous edition. Crucial in this mission will be 23-year-old goalkeeper, Inês Pereira, who will be looking to turn her domestic promise into international success. She plays her club football for Servette in Switzerland and is one of the few players in the squad playing outside Portugal. She recently made a title-winning penalty save, so she can handle nerves. The keeper made her mark at this year’s UWCL, saving a penalty against Juventus and being her side’s standout performer despite not managing to keep a clean sheet. Pereira frequently produced some fine saves against the best attackers in the world.  One of her biggest strengths is her quick reflexes, which help her pull off point-blank saves. She is quick to leave her line and close down opposition attackers in 1-v-1 situations, forcing them to make a decision while denying them time to pick their spot. She is also really quick to get down on either side to make low saves. Pereira made the fifth-most saves in the UWCL (34) last season, and only Kaylan Marckese of HB Koge made more saves from inside the box than the Portuguese (26). At 5-foot-5, she isn’t the tallest and is consequently poor at claiming crosses or dealing with aerial deliveries. The youngster will be looking to make a mark at the tournament despite competition from the more experienced Patrícia Morais. Back to player list Sweden are one of the most tactically astute sides in world football and arrive here as one of the favourites for the tournament. Peter Gerhardsson’s 4-2-3-1/4-4-2 setup provides the side with a great amount of defensive and offensive balance. The Blågult squad is littered with high-profile legends of the game like Caroline Seger, Kosovare Asllani and Hedvig Lindahl alongside one of world football’s biggest talents in Hanna Bennison. The players execute Gerhardsson’s tactical principles to the tee while offering in-game flexibility. Fresh off the back of 28 direct goal contributions across the league (nine goals, 10 assists) and UWCL (three goals, six assists) Rolfö has had an explosive first season for Barcelona, fulfilling her childhood dream to wear the Blaugrana colours. Her time at Barcelona has been a season of reinvention, as the 28-year-old winger was often deployed in an unfamiliar full-back role. She excelled at it though. Rolfö loves to have a go at goal. Blessed with a thunderbolt of a left foot, Rolfö can rip the net if given time and space anywhere outside the box. When she strikes the ball, it stays hit. Her dynamic runs down the flank offered Barcelona flexibility and her propensity to take shots helped them threaten regularly. Of her 28 shots above, 25 of them are direct shot involvements (where her involvement in a sequence was solely getting a shot away) which is the second-highest in the competition. This emphasises her advanced positioning and ability to get on the end of long moves. She has been experimented with in the No. 10 role for Sweden in their 4-2-3-1 before. She certainly has the vision and creativity to play there, recording the third-highest open-play xA in the UWCL (2.6) while registering five assists from open play, the most in the competition. Sweden will be hoping Rolfö can replicate the magic she showed this season and in their Olympics campaign to power Sweden to glory in the summer. Back to player list This will be Switzerland’s second appearance at the Euros, having failed to get out of the group stage in 2017 on their debut. They will be hoping for a better run at the second time of asking, having qualified via a play-off win over the Czech Republic. It’ll be a tough ask with defending champions Netherlands and FIFA’s second-ranked international side, Sweden, in their group. Barcelona’s versatile all-rounder Ana-Maria Crnogorčević – who is the country’s top goalscorer – will be the source of goals and shoulder much of the attack for Nils Nielsen’s side but pulling the strings from midfield will be Arsenal’s Lia Wälti. The Swiss international is a composed figure, orchestrating play and establishing control with her impeccable passing ability. She is extremely press-resistant, allowing her side to escape pressure and progress forwards at will. Wälti uses her “snake hips” to evade incoming challenges, helping her side release pressure. She serves as an integral link between defence and attack. The Swiss captain might be one of the most ambidextrous midfielders in the game. This trait allows her to play disguised passes that break opposition lines. She is pivotal in helping possession reach the final third of the pitch. Of all midfielders in the WSL last year, only Katie Zelem (257) and Sarah Mayling (242), played more passes into the final third than Wälti (229). Her passing accuracy across the pitch is immaculate, ranking fourth in the WSL for passing accuracy among all midfielders overall (84.8%) and in the opposition half (81.1%).  While not directly involved in the chance-creation phase, Wälti is adept at breaking up opposition attacks before setting her team off on the front foot. She personally started 21 sequences that ended up leading to the shots in the WSL in 2021-22, the fourth most of any midfielder. Wälti also plays an integral part in turning long phases of possession into chances. She was involved in 51 moves of 10+ passes that led to a shot for Arsenal, the fourth highest rate in the WSL, while only Katie Zelem (7.7 xG) was involved in more threatening 10+ pass sequences than Wälti (6.6). Wälti will look to shepherd her country to a fruitful Euros bringing a sense of calm amidst the chaos in midfield. Back to player list France have been the perennial pretenders on the senior international stage. They have one of the most talented squads in world football but have fallen short at crucial stages in the past. Despite the controversy surrounding Corinne Diacre’s team selection, France still boast favourable odds heading into the tournament, thanks to the talent at their disposal. Spearheading the charge for Les Bleus will be PSG’s Marie-Antoinette Katoto, who is arguably the best striker in women’s football at the moment and a game-changer on her own. The 24-year-old striker comes into Women’s Euro 2022 on the back of a 25-goal season in all competitions. Katoto has demonstrated an eye for goal throughout her career. She is a constant threat from inside the penalty area, capable of scoring from any angle. At 5-foot-8, she is also an aerial threat which adds further variation to her goalscoring. Her attacking movement is what stands out the most. She can peel off defenders or make a well-timed run in behind to get into good shooting positions, or pin back backlines with her runs into the channels and stretch them laterally with her movements out wide. While her movement and positioning allow her to get shots from excellent areas, her shot execution is on another level. A combination of shooting from good areas and clinical shot execution enable her to outperform her xG on a consistent basis. In the UWCL, she scored seven goals from an xG of just 4.7. She managed to convert this pre-shot 4.7 xG into 6.8 post-shot xG, underlining why she is one of the deadliest finishers in world football. That post-shot increase of almost two expected goals was the biggest of any player in the UWCL last season.  Katoto is one of the frontrunners for winning the top goalscorer award at the Euros 2022. Back to player list The Italian women’s national team has been on the up in recent years under Milena Bertolini. The two-time runners-up are a stubborn side to break down, blessed with a squad that allows for flexibility. Their qualification for the tournament was dramatic to say the least. Needing to win by at least six goals, Italy thrashed Israel 12-0 to secure their position as one of the best runners-up. Italy’s age profile is rather interesting. They have a good mix of talent in the traditionally preferred age bracket in midfield, with players like Manuela Giugliano (24), Arianna Caruso (22), Aurora Galli (25), all about to enter their prime years. In defence, Lisa Boattin is about to enter her peak years. The attack has promise with Annamaria Serturini (24), Sofia Cantore (22) and Agnese Bonfantini (22) but still relies heavily on the experienced shoulders of Juventus duo of Cristiana Girelli (33) and Barbara Bonansea (31). Bonansea is the heart of Italy’s attack, capable of producing inspirational moments. The 2016 Serie A female footballer of the year is a forward-thinking creative player from the wide areas, comfortable on either flank. Her playmaking revolves around receiving passes wide before cutting inside and attacking the half-spaces, from where she can use her vision to find targets in behind with her exquisite through balls. In Serie A, only two players have attempted more dribbles than the Italian winger (62), underlining her ability and love for take-ons. The former Brescia player utilises her quick change of pace and ability to bounce off challenges and skip round opponents. A proficient ball carrier, Bonansea is always thinking about moving forward whenever she gets on the ball. She loves to drive at her opposition full-back, trying to force them back into their own box.  There’s a purpose behind her ball carries, and she regularly creates chances or shooting opportunities from them. In Serie A Femminile, only three players recorded more chance-ending carries than the 31-year-old winger, while her 10 in total were a Juventus high. Despite all her attacking finesse, Bonansea doesn’t slack off in the defensive phase of the game, helping out defensively while always being an outlet to catch teams on the break.  Italy’s hopes in attack will hinge on Bonansea producing moments of quality with her ability on the ball. Back to player list The Red Flames have been pushing forward under the tutelage of Ives Serneels for a decade now. These improvements saw them earn direct qualification as group winners ahead of Switzerland, and they will be looking to one up on their performance from the 2017 edition, where they bowed out in the group stage. Grouped with France, Italy and Iceland, Belgium are capable of causing an upset, just as they did against Norway at the 2017 Euros. Janice Cayman, Tine De Caigny and Tessa Wullaert spearhead the attack. Wullaert and Cayman are the first and second top scorers for the Red Flames respectively. But behind those two sits a midfielder who will offer crucial balance to Serneels’ side. Thirty-year-old Justine Vanhaevermaet, who plays for Reading FC, is exactly that. Having missed out on the 2017 Euros due to an ACL injury, Vanhaevermaet has become even more resilient than before. A defensive midfielder primarily, she offers stability in defence with her ball-winning skills while offering safety and progression on the ball as well. The tall Belgian uses her frame to claw back possession for her side. She started 218 sequences from open play for Reading in the WSL last season, or just over 12 per 90 minutes, the seventh-highest rate among midfielders, underlining her ability to regain and recover possession. Standing over six feet, the Belgian is a viable target at set pieces, towering over her opponents in the box. Her stature further allows her to clear aerial balls on defensive set pieces too – no midfielder made more headed clearances (24) than the Belgian in the WSL. She is a good passer under pressure while being progressive with her actions when on the ball. Serneels, a defensive midfielder herself, will be hoping these qualities translate for the Belgian Red Flames this summer. Back to player list Iceland make their fourth straight appearance at the Women’s Euros and promise to bring surprises with them, much like in 2013 where they reached the quarter-final stage by defeating Norway and the Netherlands. Thorsteinn Halldórsson’s team play an intense brand of football, outrunning their opponents and hounding them, making them a frustrating side to come up against. Captain Sara Björk Gunnarsdóttir is the obvious standout, but Sveindís Jón",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2022/06/womens-euro-2022-one-player-to-watch-from-each-nation/,,,
11553,Women’s Euro 2022 Preview: The Lowdown,"Our experts look ahead to the Women’s Euro 2022 this summer, with their group-by-group preview of the 16 teams taking part in the tournament. Who are the favourites, which players are key for their team’s chances and who are there to make up the numbers? Group A: England, Austria, Norway, Northern IrelandGroup B: Germany, Denmark, Spain, FinlandGroup C: Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, PortugalGroup D: France, Italy, Belgium, Iceland Group A at the Euros might as well be renamed the ‘Group of Grudges’ as all four teams seem to regularly encounter each other on the international stage. England, Northern Ireland and Austria are in the same World Cup Qualifying group so know exactly what each offer, whilst Norway and Northern Ireland were in the same European Championship qualifying group. The Norwegians have been knocked out by England in two of the last three international tournaments, so they’ll be hoping to spoil the host’s party this time around. The last time England hosted a Women’s Euros, the experience ended in ignominy as only an injury time equaliser from a 17-year-old Karen Carney against Finland stopped them from losing every game they played. Still, they should be more confident of getting out of the group stage this time round as they are the only European side to have reached the semi-finals of the last three international competitions. A final appearance has still proven elusive for them, though – not since the Women’s Euros in 2009 have the Lionesses reached the final of a major competition. One of the players who will be hoping to change that is Beth Mead. Fresh off the back of missing out on going to the Olympics with Team GB, Mead threw herself into the Women’s Super League season, scoring twice as Arsenal beat Chelsea on the opening day. Mead equalled her highest ever goal contributions in the WSL (11 goals and eight assists – the same as 2018-19 where she had seven goals and 12 assists), and she has looked equally impressive in an England shirt, racking up 12 goals and eight assists in World Cup Qualifying. Sarina Wiegman’s main tactical shift as manager of England has been to push Leah Williamson from central defence – where she plays for Arsenal – into midfield, where it is likely she will be played in a double pivot alongside Manchester City’s Keira Walsh. Both Williamson and Walsh have established themselves as two of the most consistently solid passers in the WSL – both in the top 10 from the 2021-22 season for successful passes per 90, with Williamson’s 62.1 per 90 the fourth highest and Walsh’s 53.4/90 the ninth most. Walsh’s success rate of 88% was the second-best in WSL 2021-22 among players to play at least 1,000 minutes, while Williamson’s expert long passing range will come in hand to feed the wide players from deeper lying positions and progress the team up field quickly. None of the 25 players to attempt at least 750 passes in the WSL last season had a higher average successful pass distance than the new England captain (24.8 yards). It’s clear that Wiegman intends her England side to be possession-heavy at this tournament, so having a central midfield pairing comfortable with owning the ball will be key. The key threat for England in this group will be a Norway side which boasts a quite frankly terrifying set of attacking options. The return of all-time Champions League scorer Ada Hegerberg to the squad is a big boost for a team who scored the lowest number of goals of any country to reach the quarter finals at the 2019 World Cup. She missed two years of football with injury but has wasted no time getting back to her best, scoring in the 2022 Champions League final for Lyon during their 3-1 victory over Barcelona. Hegerberg will be flanked by Caroline Graham Hansen and Guro Reiten. No player created more chances in this season’s Champions League than Hansen (38), who also finished with the highest expected assists total in the competition (3.9). Reiten, meanwhile, spent the season playing as a left wing-back for Chelsea but it did not hinder her going forward as she equalled her highest goal contribution numbers in a WSL campaign (seven goals, five assists), as well as recording the third highest expected assists per 90 in the league (0.29).  At club level, Reiten plays with a prolific striker in the form of Sam Kerr – four of her five assists this season were for the Australian – so slotting back in with Hegerberg should be no problem.Norway shouldn’t be struggling for goals this summer. Shirt number purists look away now. Sarah Zadrazil will be wearing nine in midfield this summer, but there’s little doubt that she’s the key to Austria’s hopes of springing a surprise. Chelsea fans may remember her shot from the edge of the area in the Champions League semi-final last year which briefly looked like it could derail the Blues’ hopes of making the final. Her long-range ability could be key to Austria shocking some doubters, but she is also great at disrupting play and building attacks. Zadrazil topped the list of tackles per 90 (3.4) and possession won in the middle third per 90 (6.6) for Bayern Munich in the Champions League this season, as well as starting the most sequences ending in shots (6). In addition, only Saki Kumagai started more sequences than Zadrazil for Bayern in the competition (108 vs 103). Meanwhile, Manuela Zinsberger has had a standout season in the WSL for Arsenal, taking home the Golden Glove, with a league high save percentage of 80% (of goalkeepers to play more than half the possible minutes). Austria are particularly keen on playing it out from the back, so Zinsberger will have to keep on their toes to avoid any hairy moments. Northern Ireland enter the 2022 tournament as the lowest ranked team ever to qualify for the Women’s European Championships (48th) – that’s 19 places below the next-lowest in England this summer, Portugal (29th). They finished level on points with Wales in Group C of the qualifiers, so entered the play-offs by virtue of having a better head-to-head away goals record. A 4-1 aggregate victory over Ukraine in April’s play-offs saw them reach the finals this summer. Both of their qualifiers against Norway ended in 6-0 defeats, but they did recently draw 2-2 with Austria in World Cup Qualifying so will hope they can upset the odds and at least get something from the group. Even though it is likely they will be spending a large portion of the tournament defending, they have some goal scoring pedigree. Simone Magill holds the record for the quickest goal scored by a female international footballer, doing so after just 11 seconds against Georgia in European Championship qualifying back in 2016. Here it is! Fastest goal 11 seconds. A goal I’ll never forget #GAWA pic.twitter.com/rI4f6SnMvz The experienced Liverpool star Rachel Furness was their top scorer in qualification with five goals overall and she is their highest scoring international player in the Euro 2022 squad with 38 goals. JPH Group B looks set to be an entertaining section at Euro 2022, with record European champions Germany paired against Spain, who dream of winning their first ever European crown in women’s football. Denmark and Finland certainly aren’t there to make up the numbers, however. You can never write off one of the most successful national teams in women’s football. Germany are record eight-time European Championship winners, two-time World Cup champions as well former gold medalists at the Olympics. Despite this, the last time the Germans had success at a major tournament was in the 2016 Olympic Games, while their previous win at a Euros was in 2013. Just 10 names remain the same from the 2019 World Cup roster. This Germany is a refreshed squad sprinkled with some of the best young talent. Jule Brand secured a big transfer to VfL Wolfsburg at 19 years old after wreaking havoc in the Bundesliga for Hoffenheim this season, while Lena Oberdorf (20) and Sydney Lohmann (21) have established themselves as key midfield players at their respective clubs; Wolfsburg and Bayern Munich. Tabea Waßmuth scored 13 goals in the 2021–22 Frauen-Bundesliga, finishing behind only international team-mate Lea Schüller (16 goals) in the standings. In the UEFA Women’s Champions League this season, only Vivianne Miedema (0.75) and Jenni Hermoso (0.73) had a higher non-penalty xG per 90 than Waßmuth (0.70). Her debut season in the competition saw her score 10 goals in 10 appearances, with only Alexia Putellas (11) outscoring her. Mix these talented young players with the experience of Alex Popp, Svenja Huth, Sara Dabritz and Almuth Schult, who all won gold with Germany in 2016 – it should be a dangerous combination. The result is a well-balanced team with unbelievable attacking presence who have become one of the favourites to win the tournament. When considering Spain you must talk about Barcelona, though there is much more to this squad than Barcelona DNA. Ten of the 23 players on the Spanish roster are from the Catalan giants, with the most notable name being 2021 Ballon d’Or winner, Alexia Putellas. The Barcelona captain patrols the midfield alongside club teammates Aitana Bonmati and Patri Guijarro who have been playing together since 2016. Spain also has the Barcelona centre-back pairing in Irene Paredes and Mapi Leon alongside first choice keeper Sandra Paños, who just conceded 11 goals in 30 matches this Primera Iberdrola season. You only have to look at the impact of Putellas and Bonmati in Barcelona’s UWCL campaign this season to show how integral they can be to Spain’s chances. Those two players were the most involved of any in the competition last season, as Barcelona made the final.   While it is easy to look at Barcelona’s strength and success and hope that it crosses over into Spain’s football, Jorge Vilda has other ideas. Once you install the style of Athenea del Castillo, Lucia Garcia and Esther Gonzalez the difference between Barcelona’s style of play and Vilda’s becomes evident. Where Mariona Caldentey provides positional fluidity from the wing to make space for Putellas and Bonmati in the midfield, Del Castillo and Garcia are wingers who like to stay wide, cut in and have their chance on goal. So, while Barcelona have become the invincible team in Primera Iberdrola and have reached three UWCL finals in four years, Spain has yet to achieve any success at a major tournament. That doesn’t mean that Spain should not be discarded as one of the favourites, though, this team has been building for a few years together and finished the 2021 calendar year undefeated while also not conceding a single goal. After Denmark made it to the 2017 European Championship final, they disappointingly missed out on 2019 World Cup qualification under new manager Lars Søndergaard. The Danish squad is filled with players coming from top club sides like Real Madrid’s Sofia Svava, Lyon’s Signe Bruun, Arsenal’s Simone Boye Sørensen and Racing Louisville’s Nadia Nadim, who is making her international comeback after picking up an ACL injury in September 2021. But it’s Chelsea’s Pernille Harder who is the headline act in this squad. Harder is Denmark’s captain and record scorer. Usually found in a wide attacking position for Denmark, her ability to be both a playmaker and scorer proves to be key to leading her national team to victory. In the WSL last season, she was involved in nine goals (six goals, three assists) in 16 appearances. Though Nadim has been out of action, her importance to Denmark cannot be overlooked. She scored in the 2017 Euro final against the Netherlands and netted two crucial goals over Italy to secure 2022 Euro qualification for Denmark.  Even with the odds stacked against them in Group B, Anna Signeul’s side should not be overlooked. Finland has a showstopper keeper in Tinja-Riikka Korpela who has come up with big saves for Tottenham Hotspur in the FA WSL, while Portland Thorn’s Natalia Kuikka and Juventus’ Tuija Hyyrynen are certainly ones to watch. Real Sociedad’s striker, Sanni Franssi is coming off a big season in Spain finishing with 10 goals and seven assists and could be important for Finland in what some are labelling the ‘group of death’. The experienced striker Linda Sällström – Finland’s record scorer – netted 10 goals for the Finns in qualifying for these finals – only Belgium’s Tine De Caigny (12) scored more. AI Group C contains two of the top four teams in world football, with Sweden currently second in the FIFA rankings, and the Netherlands in fourth place. Mark Parsons’ Dutch side are the reigning Euro champions, but can they add a back-to-back title this summer? With the exit of manager Sarina Wiegmann, the Netherlands have had a much-needed refresh with new boss Mark Parsons. The Dutch are defending Euro champions, reached the final of the 2019 World Cup and reached the quarter-finals of the 2021 Olympic Games, so they’ll be a contender in England this summer. Their most notable name is Arsenal striker Vivianne Miedema who became the Netherlands’ all-time leading scorer (men and women) at 22-years-old. She is also the WSL all-time top scorer with 74 goals in 84 appearances. This season, Gunners’ boss Jonas Eidevall has converted Miedema into an attacking midfielder deploying her behind central striker, Stina Blackstenius. Parsons described Miedema in a recent press conference as “the best number nine in the world who also can be the best number 10 in the world.” While Miedema will undoubtedly be the most talked about name in this Dutch squad there is undeniable talent around her. Lieke Martens has finally come back from her injury that left her out of action for Barcelona for over two months, and she still finished fifth in Primera Iberdrola’s top scorers chart with 16 goals and third in assists with 13. The Dutch defence is their Achilles heel, but their midfield has very strong depth. There is Sherida Spitse who debuted with the national team in 2006 at just 16 years old, while Manchester United’s Jackie Groenen and Lyon’s Danielle van de Donk provide a strong attacking presence with excellent ball recovery skills. However, it’s Damaris Egurrola who could take the spotlight in the midfield. Egurrola switched alliances to the Netherlands from Spain after Jorge Vilda never included her in his international squad selection. She has proved to be one of the most promising young players at 22-years-old and could be a key factor for the Dutch in what will be her first major tournament with a senior squad. One of the strong favourites to win their second European Championship title after success in 1984, and with good reason. Sweden have had recent success on the international stage, winning bronze at the 2019 World Cup and silver at the 2021 Olympic Games. In the 2017 European Championships they fell in the quarter-finals to eventual champions, the Netherlands. Peter Gerhardsson has arguably the most well-balanced squad in the tournament. There’s Magdalena Eriksson leading a strong defensive line following a strong season at WSL champions Chelsea, an experienced Kosovare Asllani organising the midfield and an in-form Fridolina Rolfö starring in the attack. Arsenal’s Stina Blackstenius (six goals in 11 WSL games last season) and Juventus’ Lina Hurtig (four goals in 19 games in Serie A last season) will no doubt get their name on the scoresheet, but it’s Rolfö who is the one to watch from Sweden’s attack. Her first season at FC Barcelona saw her play both right-back and right-wing, and she finished the season with nine goals and 10 assists in Primera Iberdrola and a further three goals and six assists in the UWCL. Outsiders in the Euros this year, Switzerland are a team who have been building a solid squad over the past few years. They are managed by Nils Nelson who previously led Denmark to the 2017 Euro final. Although they’re going to be missing Aston Villa striker, Alisha Lehmann, there are still plenty of players to look out for. Swiss captain and Arsenal midfielder Lia Wälti will be a key figure in this Switzerland squad. Nicknamed “snake hips” in the WSL, her calmness as a deep lying midfielder will allow Switzerland to play the ball out effectively to their attackers. A key part of a strong Arsenal side in 2021-22, she averaged the third-most successful passes per 90 minutes in the WSL for the Gunners last season (50), while making more tackles than any other player at the club (49). PSG’s Ramona Bachmann leads the Swiss attack and is coming off a strong season that finished with four goals and two assists in the UWCL, including the extra-time goal that took Paris Saint-Germain to the semi-finals. Alongside her in the attack is Barcelona’s Ana-Maria Crnogorcevic whose positional flexibility saw her play at full-back, winger and central striker throughout the domestic season for the Spanish giants. The vast club experience seen throughout the squad could be enough to see Switzerland cause the more fancied nations some issues this summer. Francisco Neto’s side got their spot at the Euro 2022 following Russia’s suspension for this tournament. Of Portugal’s 23 players, 21 play their club football in Portugal, with Benfica and Sporting CP each represented by six players. The two playing their football abroad are Tatiana Pinto with Levante in Spain and Ines Pereira with Servette in Switzerland. The Portuguese keeper made waves in the UWCL after Servette held Chelsea to a 0-0 draw until the 67th minute. Pereira will no doubt be crucial for Portugal when coming up against Vivianne Miedema and Fridolina Roflö in the group stage. A major worry for the Portuguese will be their lack of goalscoring threat, with just 10 goals scored in their 10 qualifiers for Euro 2022 (including play-offs) – by far the lowest of any side at this summer’s tournament. AI Group D is ostensibly the toughest group in the competition with only 14 places separating France – ranked fifth in the FIFA rankings – and Belgium, ranked 19th, with Italy (14th) and Iceland (16th) sandwiched in between. Which two teams will progress to the knockout stage? It’s hard to tell. On paper, France are an incredibly talented side with the front three of Kadidiatou Diani, Sandy Baltimore and Marie-Antoinette Katoto one of the most lethal in world football. The three of them, who all play together at Paris St-Germain, scored a combined 35 goals in the French league this season. Katoto also broke PSG’s all-time goal scoring record in 2021-22, despite only being 23 years old, with her goal tally now at 108 in 113 appearances for them. Diani, meanwhile, thrives off running with the ball. Across all players in the D1 Féminine in 2021-22, only Kessya Bussy (33) embarked on a higher number of carries that ended in a shot for her team than Diani (29 – 17 shots, 12 chances created). Team-mate Baltimore is only 22 years old but her 13 assists in the D1 Féminine was the highest in the league, four ahead of the next best figure in the competition. Only Selma Bacha created more chances for team-mates in the competition (62) than Baltimore (45). Bacha – still only 21 years old – has hit new heights at left-back this season with Lyon, also topping the chance creation (32) and assist (seven) rankings in the Champions League, yet arguably her most impressive performance of the season was defensive in nature, as she kept Caroline Graham Hansen totally under wraps during the final of the competition. It would not be the French women’s team without some controversy though, and Corinne Diacre’s decision to leave Amandine Henry at home was met with shock. They’ll be hoping that the decision was a correct one, come July 31.  Iceland could be one of the dark horses of this summer’s competition with them currently sitting top of a World Cup Qualifying group which includes the Netherlands. Their squad combines an experienced core – eight players are 30 or older – with exciting youth talent. 21-year-old Sveindis Jane Jonsdóttir is one of those exciting younger prospects. She had several eye-catching performances in the Champions League for VfL Wolfsburg as she combines the typical traits of a young winger with a trebuchet of a long throw. That might particularly come in handy for Iceland as they attack thanks to Dagny Brynjarsdóttir’s aerial ability. West Ham’s Brynjarsdóttir (36) won the second highest number of aerial duels in the WSL last year, behind only Chelsea’s Sam Kerr (42). They conceded just five goals in eight qualifiers for these finals, with two of those coming in their only defeat – a 2-0 loss away in Sweden. Elín Metta Jensen was their top scorer in qualification, with her six goals coming across five of their eight matches. Italy are another team who are often tipped to be on the edge of doing something special, and equally have a mixture of old hands and new hopes. In defence, they will have captain Sara Gama who formed part of a Juventus defence to concede just 14 goals in 22 league games across 2021-22 in Serie A, as they went on to win their fifth successive league title – all coming since Gama joined the club in 2017. Meanwhile Cristiana Girelli and Valentina Giacinti can be relied on in front of goal, having won four of the past five Golden Boots in Serie A between them. Left-back Lisa Boattin is also a player to keep an eye on. During Juventus’ impressive Champions League run, she played the most passes into the box and had the most successful passes in the opposition’s half. The 25-year-old also scored directly from a corner this season, so goalkeepers should be wary of a repeat this summer. Belgium are the lowest ranked side in the group in the FIFA rankings and look to have a pretty tough task on their hands. If they are to cause opponents some problems it will likely be through captain Tessa Wullaert, who previously scored six goals in 31 appearances for Manchester City when she played there between 2018 and 2020. Hoffenheim’s Tine de Caigny is also a player who might be able to shine for the Belgians, scoring four goals and getting three assists in her debut season in the Frauen-Bundesliga, as well as contributing two goals in what was a tough Champions League group containing Arsenal and Barcelona. Belgium will be hopeful they can at least equal their record from 2017 where they managed to win one group stage game. Unlike Italy and Iceland, Belgium did win their qualification group for these finals, finishing ahead of Switzerland with a record of seven wins and one defeat in eight matches.

11608,Budapest 2.0: Barcelona and Lyon Have a Score to Settle,"It’s May 28 2019, Lyon lead Barcelona 4-0 inside 20 minutes in the UEFA Women’s Champions League final, thanks to a hat-trick from the future UWCL top scorer and goalscoring behemoth, Ada Hegerberg. Barcelona are down and out before we reach the half-hour mark. When the two sides met in Budapest that day, Lyon were reigning and defending champions of the last three years, the team to beat. Barcelona, on the other hand, were the pretenders, the wannabes, with a dream to sit atop the European throne.  Fast forward to 2022, the scene is similar, the stage is similar, the faces are familiar, the stakes are similar and still, everything has changed as the two teams meet again in the final. Barcelona have tasted European glory, inflicting the same wounds on Chelsea that Lyon gave them three years back, running away with the game inside 30 minutes. In the process, they became the first side not named Lyon to win the UWCL since 2015, and did so in a comprehensive manner. They are now the team to beat in Europe, finishing the 2021-22 season with a perfect domestic record of 30 wins in 30 games and an earth-shattering goal difference of +148. On their route to the final, they have scored the most goals (37) while giving up joint fewest (7). Their defeat to Wolfsburg in the semi-final – a dead-rubber tie considering they’d won the first leg 5-1 – was their first in 45 games.  They are showcasing unrivalled dominance, much akin to Lyon not that long ago. Lyon are a side transitioning from veterans and legends of the game to young blood with a ceiling that breaks the roof. Players like Ellie Carpenter, Selma Bacha, Damaris Egurrola, Delphine Cascarino, Catarina Macário and Melvine Malard are all under 25 and integral parts of the squad, playing significant minutes in the competition. The old guard like Wendie Renard and Amandine Henry add much-needed experience to the locker room. Lyon might not be a winning juggernaut right now but they are stocking up to be one in the near future with their signings, all the while remaining incredibly competitive in the short term. Sonia Bompastor has managed to utilize her squad really well, with at least 20 players playing 90 minutes or more. Barcelona’s depth is arguably the best in the world. Not only is their starting XI littered with talent but the options off the bench are excellent as well. The different profiles in the squad allows Jonatan Giráldez to tweak his set-up to counter the opposition’s game plan. This has allowed for a better spread of minutes in the squad this season compared to last, and has allowed Barcelona to navigate injuries to key players fairly well. The squad’s average age of 27.9 years sits perfectly in the bracket where footballers peak, highlighting the ingredients for sustained dominance. Giráldez, who was the assistant under previous manager Lluís Cortés, has stuck with the basic principles of his predecessor but has added his own spice to the team. Barcelona utilize a typical 4-3-3 formation on paper that resembles a 2-3-5 in possession which allows them to push as many as five bodies inside the penalty box for a cross when they reach the final third. Barcelona try to position multiple players in between the lines, occupying zone 14 – the area just outside the penalty box– and the half-spaces. This facilitates quick combinations at the edge of the area to get the ball into the box and disrupts opposition defensive blocks.  The 2-3 shape at the back gives Barcelona security if the ball is lost. The assurance of a good defensive structure allows Giráldez’s side to hound their opponents high up the pitch to win back possession. No side has made more high turnovers in the UWCL than Barcelona’s 196, and their average of 19.6 per game is also a competition high. They are also the masters at converting these opportunities into shots, averaging 4.5 shot-ending turnovers per game. The Spanish giants look to assert their dominance by monopolising the ball, and have an average possession of 69.7% throughout the competition. Unsurprisingly, that dominance sees them spend a lot of time in the opposition’s third. Their field tilt, a measure of the share of possession a team has in the attacking third, sits at 89.2%, which is the highest in the competition. To put that into context, if you added up all the completed passes and touches in the final third for both teams in their matches, Barca’s opponents make up just over 10% of that total tally.  The personnel at Barcelona allows a level of tactical flexibility that is hard to prepare for. They can play with traditional wingers like Lieke Martens and Caroline Graham Hansen who can stay wide and take on their full-backs. The duo can wreak havoc in one-vs-one situations, with the former preferring to cut inside to shoot while the latter has a proclivity to attack the byline for cutbacks. In such instances, Barcelona try to create situations that isolate their wide players against the opposition full-backs via long diagonals, allowing them to showcase their one-vs-one prowess. In other cases, Giráldez tweaks this by playing a nominal winger on the left, usually Mariona Caldentey or Claudia Pina, who inverts more centrally.  In doing so, Barcelona gain an extra body in the middle of the park, with both Pina and Mariona’s natural tendency to invert inside and get on the ball as much as possible. Aitana has been used in this role as well, providing similar qualities. This adds a level of fluidity and fits well their usage of full-backs.  The touch maps below of Aitana against Hoffenheim and Mariona against Arsenal – both of who were named the left-sided player of a front free on the teamsheet – show just how much they like to drift inside.  As is the trend in modern football, full-backs have turned into more than just defenders. They can be anything from a team’s primary chance creator to an auxiliary midfielder in the buildup phases. Barcelona utilizes theirs depending on the personnel. Giráldez opts for asymmetrical full-backs in his system. Summer signing Fridolina Rolfo, naturally a left winger, has been recast as a full-back this season. This change has added a new dimension to Barcelona’s attack as it allows her space to bomb forwards with her runs. Rolfo is heavily involved in Barcelona’s shot creation ranking fifth in the competition for her contribution to shots. But while someone like Mapi Leon is heavily involved in the buildup to shots, Rolfo is in the business of shooting herself. Of her 27 shots above, 24 of them are direct shot involvements (where her involvement in a sequence was solely getting a shot away) which is the second-highest in the competition. This emphasises her advanced positioning and ability to get on the end of long moves.  Rolfo is not only about end product though, she’s also a creator. Her expected assists total of 2.4 is the fourth-highest xA in the competition. She is blessed with a wicked left foot, which can rip a hole in the net when allowed time and space to shoot, while simultaneously cultured enough to create chances.  While their full-backs are an attacking pillar, they have often been a spot of worry when Barcelona defend. Pushing their full-backs high up the pitch leaves a lot of space on the flanks for the opposition to target. The full-backs aren’t particularly strong in one-vs-one defensive duels either, with neither Rolfo or Marta Torrejon natural defenders. Luckily for Barcelona, they have got two of the world’s best central defenders guarding this space. Mapi León and Irene Paredes are both excellent at covering ground and in their individual defensive duels, with Mapi boasting of a success rate of 71.4% on her duels. This provides coverage for the full-backs to attack. The defensive action maps of both centre-halves below shows they are adept at sweeping up danger down the channels.  The Spanish centre-half duo is a perfect blend of complementary profiles, with Paredes particularly adept at putting out fires before they begin. She uses a good mix of denying the opponent time and cramping them for space by stepping out or showing them away from the goal using her body shape. Beyond being excellent defenders both are an indispensable part of Barcelona’s buildup, and are extremely comfortable on the ball. Both help bring the ball out of their own third via their ball carrying, pushing opponents back and breaking lines. No player has recorded more progressive carries (124) and 10+ metre progressive carries (56) than Mapi in the UWCL. This obviously comes with a caveat that she finds herself with a lot of space ahead of her to carry the ball over longer distances before being challenged. Apart from her ball carrying, Mapi’s range and accuracy on the ball allows for a direct route into the attacking third for Barcelona, enabling Giráldez’s side to switch the point of attack with ease. Only Caroline Graham Hansen has been responsible for starting more open-play sequences ending in a shot (18) than Mapi León (16). Ahead of the defensive line sits a world-class trio of midfielders. The two interiors, Alexia and Aitana sit ahead of Patri Guijarro as the pivot and are both extremely dynamic players who offer a level of fluidity that makes them unpredictable. Their collective understanding of space manipulation is world class and they are blessed with an unrivalled vision on the ball to create opportunities. Ballon D’or winner, Alexia Putellas, has created the most open-play chances (32) in the competition this season. The tendency of their interiors to make bombing runs into the opposition box poses all sorts of problems for the opposition’s defensive organization. These forward runs into the box from a starting midfield position regularly break opposition lines and are difficult for the opposition defenders to track. Midfield pivot Patri Guijarro is a master at finding these runs through chipped balls into space. The cohesion between the midfield trio is almost telepathic. Lyon have ushered in a new era under former player, Sonia Bompastor. She has shown a fair bit of tactical flexibility in her approach so far, lining up her team usually in a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-3-3. Her side can seamlessly transition between different approaches with and without the ball to accommodate different tactical plans. Like Barcelona, Lyon’s full-backs Ellie Carpenter and Selma Bacha are crucial to their attacking play. The deepest midfielder is key in freeing up the full-backs to attack, by dropping in the backline and providing cover.  The fundamental idea behind Bacha’s set-up is to stretch the field and attack from wide areas through a combination between the wide players and the No. 10, allowing for crosses into the box. Delphine Cascarino and Selma Bacha have been two primary chance creators for the side, with 20 and 30 chances created respectively. A look at Lyon’s attack broken down by thirds shows just how much they use the flanks going forwards. A standout feature of Bompastor’s reign has been the establishment of certain young players in the team, most notably Selma Bacha and Catarina Macário. Macário, playing her first full season, has been one of the most integral figures of this Lyon side. She has multiple facets to her game, from her on-ball ability to her ability in physical duels, and is currently their top scorer in all competitions and has scored seven goals in the UWCL along with two assists. Her goal against Juventus showcased her excellent first touch and awareness in the box. The Brazilian-born American has even got wicked set-pieces in her locker. Deployed in a No. 10 role, Macário is given the license to roam and provide support wherever required. She is excellent at playing neat one-twos at the edge of the area before attacking the box and getting the shot off. Nobody has taken more shots following a one-two with a team-mate (4) in the UWCL this season. Selma Bacha’s reinvention under Bompastor has been vital for their campaign. Initially utilized in an advanced role on the wings, she has been moved into her more natural full-back role of late. With space to roam in front of her, she has been able to showcase her impeccable crossing ability, working in tandem with inside forwards like Melvine Malard on the flank. The Lyon academy graduate is currently the top assist provider for Lyon in the league and the UWCL, with 14 assists in total. Another weapon in Lyon’s armoury is their set-piece prowess. With players capable of whipping in excellent deliveries, like Bacha, for targets like 6-foot-5 Wendie Renard, it’s a perfect recipe for hurting opponents. Bacha has created the most chances from set-piece situations, 16, in the UWCL this season. Without the ball is where a lot of interesting things happen for Lyon, as Bompastor’s inclination to set her team up to press high has seen them deploy different pressing systems. They are only behind Barcelona for the number of pressed sequences (265) with 244 in the competition this year, showing their desire to force a turnover high up the pitch. They are intense in their approach too, recording a PPDA value of 9.1 in the competition, which is on par with Barcelona’s 9.2, although they aren’t as able to convert the resulting high turnovers into shots. Barcelona will likely dominate the ball and the territory but Lyon have been happy to concede possession when required. Their wing-dominant chance creation practice worked wonders in their previous encounter and bodes well with where Barcelona usually concede chances from. But with the quality humming through Barca’s squad and the added experience at this stage, Lyon’s execution this time around will have to be inch-perfect. Lyon’s success and dominance in this competition is unrivalled, with the French club winning the trophy a record seven times and five consecutive times between 2015 and 2020. They were challenged but never toppled, not until 2021. Barcelona, on the other hand, are looking to successfully defend the title in their first attempt. While the roles have reversed, this final will be some spectacle. The pretenders are the team to beat while the once juggernauts are the challengers. There is a score to settle between the two on the biggest stage of them all and the world will be watching… again! Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

11617,“We Had the Highest Expected Goals”: Chelsea’s WSL Title in Numbers,"As the sun shone down on Kingsmeadow, Emma Hayes was handed the microphone in the midst of Chelsea’s title-winning celebrations. “We had the highest expected goals,” she boomed out to the still full ground. “We had the lowest expected goals against.” Then she apologised: “I’m sorry for getting straight into the data”. Hayes has long been known for her meticulous attention to detail, something brought to public attention through her punditry at the Euros, and it bore fruit again as Chelsea won their third consecutive Women’s Super League title. The league victory took Hayes’ total to five as well as one Spring Series trophy. No team has ever won three back-to-back WSL titles and the win over Manchester United on the final day took Hayes’ personal record to 114 WSL wins, 42 more than any other manager. Here we take a look at some of the numbers behind Chelsea’s 2021-22 WSL win. The final day of the WSL season did not start well for Chelsea. They knew they had to equal or better Arsenal’s result to retain the title but with Arsenal playing West Ham, the game against Manchester United felt like a must-win match. Instead, they found themselves losing 2-1 at half-time following a first 45 minutes that saw them easily played through by United’s front three of Leah Galton, Alessia Russo and Martha Thomas. Emma Hayes has not been reserved about switching up her team this season, and the final day was no different. She brought on Bethany England and Ji So-Yun for Jonna Andersson and Sophie Ingle, switching from a 4-4-2 for a 3-4-3. It was the tenth game where she had made half-time substitutes and across the season Chelsea made 96 in total, with only Arsenal making more (97). It also showed something Hayes has emphasised all year – her side’s tactical flexibility. Chelsea looked totally unphased with the formation switch, in part because they have been playing different versions of it all season. Emma Hayes had originally switched to a back three at half-time in last season’s Champions League final, when Chelsea were 4-0 down to Barcelona, but it took many by surprise when she continued it into the start of the WSL season in Chelsea’s opening match against Arsenal. If it was supposed to make them more defensively solid, there was little evidence of that when they conceded three goals at the Emirates. Hayes persisted, however, and it proved to be just under a third of their concessions all season. Yet as the season progressed, Hayes began to move away from the back three. Chelsea became more and more flexible, leaving viewers squinting at team sheets trying to figure out what formation they would play. The final match of the season was the crowning moment for the versatility Hayes has used all year long, as the half-time reshaping saw Chelsea turn a 2-1 deficit in their favour to win 4-2 and secure the title. There have been subtler tactical changes from Hayes this season too. Chelsea have continued to press intensely with their PPDA rising ever-so-slightly from 9.8 to 10.1 this year. Perhaps more interestingly, the way other teams press in the WSL has changed around them. While Chelsea have maintained an intense pressing style, their rivals in this category Manchester City (8.4 to 10.1) Reading (9.7 to 13.6) have scale back the pressure a fair bit. As a result, Chelsea have gone from having the third lowest PPDA in 2020-21 to the joint-lowest in 2021-22, despite hardly changing themselves. Their press continues to be effective at winning the ball back in dangerous situations. Chelsea’s 45 shot-ending high turnovers was the highest figure in the league this season. Hayes’ side have played slightly more vertical this season compared to last, holding onto the ball for a shorter time per sequence on average and stringing fewer passes together per sequence. To say it’s a style change might be too far though, with those numbers till among the highest figures in the league. Compared to Arsenal and Manchester City though, the Blues have moved the ball faster, with the former two sides averaging almost a second longer in possession. Despite some heavy beatings in other competitions, Chelsea ended the season as the most defensively solid side based on their expected goals against in the WSL. Although they did concede one more goal than Arsenal, their run of seven home clean sheets was essential to their success, and no mean feat given that they missed captain and centre-back Magda Eriksson for a large portion of that time period. They were particularly effective when it came to defending set pieces, conceding only 2.5 xGA from them all season, a league-low. Even though they allowed more shots from set pieces (47) than Manchester City and Arsenal, the xG conceded shows they were forcing opposition teams to take shots from low-value areas. Ann-Katrin Berger missed out on the Golden Glove to Arsenal’s Manuela Zinsberger, but she came out on top as the best goalkeeper in the league in terms of goals prevented., with her saves worth almost two goals over the campaign. Berger had a mixed season in a Chelsea shirt, sharing her minutes close to equally with Zecira Musovic, whilst her red card in a must-win game against Tottenham looked to have seriously jeopardised Chelsea’s title hopes. Yet despite that, she still proved herself to be the best shot-stopper in the league. Guro Reiten has been one of Chelsea’s standout players this season, but it could all have been so different. Reiten made only nine starts in 2020-21, despite having been essential to Chelsea’s 2019-20 title win. The signing of Pernille Harder along with Fran Kirby’s return to fitness saw her pushed to the bench. She became, however, a key beneficiary of Hayes’ tactical switch at half-time in the Champions League final, coming off the bench then and not looking back. Utilised in what was previously an unfamiliar left wing-back role, Reiten has shone, recording seven goals and five assists, just one fewer goal contribution than she made in 2019-20. That ranks her joint seventh in the WSL this season, with Katie McCabe the only other player who is not a pure forward in the top ten. Chelsea’s dominance on the ball obviously allows her to push much higher up the pitch than a traditional wing-back might, as seen by the fact that 104 of her open-play sequence involvements ended in shots, the sixth highest in the league. Meanwhile, the number of times she deceived goalkeepers with a floated ball into the side-netting suggested she was scoring those ‘crosses’ on purpose. The third goal against Manchester United on Sunday showed what a fantastic all-round asset she is for Chelsea as her movement into the box allowed her to finish unmarked. It seems hard to believe that over the summer, there were whispers she might be looking to move on. You cannot talk about Chelsea this season without also talking about Sam Kerr. Kerr became the first player ever to score more than twenty goals in two consecutive WSL seasons, as she won the Golden Boot again. Since her WSL debut in January 2020, she has scored 42, more than anyone else during that time period. Kerr finished off her season in spectacular style, scoring a left-footed and then a right-footed volley against Manchester United to hit 20 goals for the season. She had the highest expected goals per 90 in the league with 0.69 and highest goals per 90 with 1.16. In the end, she scored 35% of her goals with her head, 20% with her left foot and 45% with her right foot. Not just a goal machine, she also tallied up four assists, and for every 100 open-play sequences she was involved in, almost five ended in goals, the highest in the league.  Overall, she was involved in 29 of Chelsea’s goals this season, almost 50% of what they scored in the league. Whilst the volleys against Manchester United will surely go down as the most spectacular, her 92nd-minute winner against Aston Villa and her header when Chelsea were down to ten players away at Tottenham were the most important. When she first arrived at Chelsea, some doubted whether she would be able to adjust to the WSL. She is currently the ninth all-time top scorer in the league after just over two seasons here, and is scoring at a rate of 0.92 goals per game. That is even faster than Vivianne Miedema. No team wins a league title without using the full depth of their squad but Chelsea were forced to rely on all of their players as they looked to see out the title through their nine-game winning run at the end of the year. With Fran Kirby ruled out indefinitely with fatigue, Bethany England found herself back in contention to start again, racking up an expected goals per 90 figure of 0.65. Only Sam Kerr had a better average in the entirety of the WSL. Meanwhile, the unavailability of Melanie Leupolz due to pregnancy saw Jessie Fleming get a much more prominent role in the squad, with her expected assists per 90 of 0. 24 ranking her eighth in the league overall. Fran Kirby had the highest xA per 90 in the league with 0.38, highlighting just how much of a miss she was for Chelsea. Jess Carter became a stalwart in the Chelsea team, playing more minutes than she ever had previously in a WSL season, including when she was at Birmingham. This came after starting only three matches the year before, a mark of how much she has risen in Hayes’ estimations. She was rightly applauded for her ability to keep Lauren Hemp quiet in both Manchester City matches, demonstrating how much her one vs. one defending has improved. Her reading of the game has also been important to Chelsea, with her 3.2 interceptions per 1000 opposition touches the highest at the club and fifth highest in the league. Carter’s versatility saw her used all over the pitch, at points playing up to three different positions a game, making her an essential piece in Hayes’ plan to be as tactically flexible as possible. Aniek Nouwen also got significantly more minutes than many would have predicted at the start of the season thanks to both Chelsea’s preference for a back three and Magda Eriksson’s injury problems. Making 12 starts, Chelsea conceded only two goals when she was on the pitch. Chelsea’s recruitment last summer was relatively limited with big signing Lauren James only playing 113 minutes this season, and the impact of sanctions on the team has cast a cloud on what they might be able to do this year. The departures of Ji So-Yun, Drew Spence and Jonna Andersson mean there are certainly holes in Chelsea’s squad, but the performances of their team players this year mean there is an incredibly strong base.

11646,Who’s Impressed in the WSL this Season?,"As the 2021-22 Women’s Super League season draws to a close, we look at five standout stars from the campaign. This isn’t a list of the greatest players in the WSL and not all names are obvious choices, but they’ve made a big impact for a variety of reasons. Given the role that Erin Cuthbert has played in this Chelsea side over the years, it’s easy to forget that she is still only 23 years old. Concerns about whether she gets enough minutes in a squad brimming with talent have been assuaged, as her continued reliability has seen her play more 1201 minutes for Chelsea in 2021-22 and only 192 off her record in a single campaign with four games remaining. Emma Hayes has used Cuthbert in various positions on the pitch this season, as injuries have often left Chelsea stretched. But over the past couple of games, she has settled on a role that could end up becoming Cuthbert’s long-term home. Chelsea have struggled to conclusively decide on a midfield double-pivot partnership this season with both tactical considerations and player availability leading to numerous combinations being trialled. The recent pairing of Sophie Ingle and Erin Cuthbert, however, is one that Hayes seems to believe offers Chelsea both defensive solidity and progression. Cuthbert’s wide variety of skills means she can do a lot for the team from this position. Her 13.3 carries per 90 rank her in the top five for non-defenders in the league, meaning she can progress the ball forward for Chelsea, but she also leads the side for number of tackles (37) and only Millie Bright and Jessica Carter have made more interceptions and regained possession more often than Cuthbert for the club in the WSL this season. Cuthbert’s ability both on and off the ball makes Chelsea look like a much more energetic and dynamic side. The pairing with Ingle has been tested against both Manchester City and Arsenal, and in neither match did Chelsea concede. If Hayes is happy to stick with it long term, Cuthbert might finally have found a position where she can settle. Katerina Svitkova is one of a host of West Ham signings from last season who have finally come into their own under Olli Harder. Having played as a central midfielder under Matt Beard, Harder converted her into his left-sided wing-back when he replaced Beard halfway through the 2020-21 season, and she has taken to the role with aplomb. Svitkova’s ability in transition has made her an important attacking outlet for West Ham. She’s been involved in a team-high 50 of West Ham’s open play attacking sequences this season in the WSL, with 15 of those as the player to create the chance – another high for the London club. Overall, she leads West Ham in terms of chances created (22) as well as completing more dribbles (14) than anyone else in the squad, while, overall, only five players in the league have completed more dribbles than she has. Her ability on the ball allows her to release pressure by getting out of tight situations defensively, as well as drive her team forward into more dangerous areas. Rather than trying to move the ball into the area, Svitkova tends to cross it in. This plays to West Ham’s strengths, as they like to use late runners from midfield to overpower the defensive team in the box. Only Lauren Hemp (65) has made more crosses from open play than Katerina Svitkova (51). With West Ham overtaking their highest ever WSL points total, Svitkova has been key to them establishing themselves as a mid-table side. Whilst Arsenal tend to get a lot of praise for their attacking riches, Jonas Eidevall’s side are currently on track to concede their fewest number of goals in a WSL season since it became a 10-team league. This is despite the mid-season defensive wobble, which can be attributed in part to Leah Williamson’s injury, and Arsenal have Manuela Zinsberger to thank in particular for this. Zinsberger has rarely been heralded as a goalkeeping star in the WSL; such praise has tended to be focused on Ann-Katrin Berger at Chelsea and Ellie Roebuck at Manchester City. But with Berger currently out of favour in West London and Roebuck having been replaced by Mary Earps as England’s first choice goalkeeper, Zinsberger has clearly been the standout woman between the sticks this season. In terms of expected goals on target conceded, Zinsberger has let in one more goal than the model would expect her to, but those are the best numbers in the league of any keeper to have played more than 60% of their team’s minutes. Her save percentage of 80% is also the highest of any goalkeeper playing that amount of time. But Zinsberger’s importance to Arsenal does not end at shot stopping. After all, the clubs at the very top of the league are looking for their goalkeeper to do a lot more than that. Zinsberger has made more successful passes than any other goalkeeper in the league (503), while she’s also been involved in the build-up to 22 shtos in the WSL this season – only Man Utd’s Mary Earps has been involved in more (23). Zinsberger has always been seen as a goalkeeper who has potential – this season, she is fulfilling it. No player has played more minutes for Manchester City this season than Alex Greenwood, with the defender starting every single league game for them. In a year where defensive calamity has plagued City, leaving them fighting to even get into next season’s Champions League, Greenwood has been the consistent shining light, with Gareth Taylor’s decision to view her as a centre back rather than a left back one of the most tactically astute decisions in his time at the club. Greenwood is undeniably a central defender who thrives off having the ball. She’s the only WSL player with over 1000 unique open play build up sequence involvements (1023), while she also leads the league for starting these sequences (244) in 2021-22. 67 of these have ended in a shot for her team, another league high. Greenwood’s ability with long, lofted balls help City quickly switch play and make use of their fast-paced wingers in Lauren Hemp, Hayley Raso, and Jess Park. Her successful passes – which average 20.4 yards in length, have contributed to Manchester City making the highest number of direct attacks in the WSL this season with 29. The fact that she is so good with the ball at her feet also means she has a big role to play in set pieces for City, with her corner-taking helping to give her the second highest expected assists total within the entire Manchester City squad (2.3). However, even accounting for chances created from open play, Greenwood is City’s third most productive with 18. Manchester City’s league season might still end in disappointment, but it will not be because of a lack of effort on Greenwood’s part. There are only three players younger than Shannon O’Brien to have played more than 1000 minutes this year in the WSL. The 20-year-old forward joined Leicester in the January before their promotion and has been one of the Foxes most relied upon players this season. It is not always easy for a young player to stand out in a team who are fighting to stay in the league, but O’Brien’s commitment has shone through. With 12 chances created for Leicester this season, only two other under-21 players in the league (Hanna Bennison and Maya le Tissier) have created more for their clubs. At Leicester, only Jemma Purfield (1.53) has a higher expected assists total than O’Brien (1.13) – impressive in her first top-flight season at such a young age, while playing for one of the struggling clubs. Leicester have all but guaranteed their safety, despite heavy recent defeats to Chelsea and Arsenal, giving Lydia Bedford the chance to really stamp her mark on the team next season. O’Brien’s experience already at this level, despite her age, means she could become a key component of this Leicester team as they look to grow.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2022/04/wsl-players-impressed-2021-22/,Jesse Parker Humphreys,20/04/2022 5:25,the-analyst
11680,Crunch Time in the UWCL: Barcelona vs. Real Madrid,"The UEFA Women’s Champions League has reached the knockout stages, with four big quarter-final ties to be played across March. One of those ties sees Real Madrid play rivals and reigning champions Barcelona. The 2021-22 UEFA Women’s Champions League was the first to have a group stage following the reorganisation of the competition in 2009. Only half the 16 teams remain in the competition as we head into the knockout stages, with possibly the biggest surprise being the departure of English WSL champions Chelsea in the groups on head-to-head goal difference. Reigning Champions League winners Barcelona were as dominant as expected in Group C, but if anything their performances exceeded expectations. The main ingredient for Barcelona’s success has been their ability to play the ‘Barca way’ with their club ethos of tiki-taka shown throughout their group stage performances. Barcelona held at least 64% possession in all six of their group stage matches, with their group stage average of 72% being the highest of any side. They completed 90% of their passes, with that ratio being 87% in the opposition half, while averaging almost five passes per sequence (4.9). Barca also led the way in the UWCL group stage with 140 open play sequences of 10 or more passes – 48 more than the next highest, Arsenal (92) – while they had a competition-high 45 of those ending with either a shot or touch in the opposition box. Further proof of their possession having purpose is that of the 23 passing sequences that have seen at least 15 passes leading to a shot, over half (12) were by Barcelona in the group stages of this UWCL. Field tilt is a metric to show the territorial dominance between teams. Put simply, it measures the share of possession a team has in a game, considering only touches or passes in the attacking third. It can be useful when trying to understand which team is more dominant in games, rather than looking at overall possession, mainly as it looks at how teams are able to get the ball into areas that matter. Barcelona’s field tilt average is 91% in the Women’s Champions League this season in the group stage, meaning they have nine times as much possession in the final third as their opponents – the highest in the competition ahead of Paris Saint-Germain (83%) and the knocked-out Chelsea (76%). The Catalan side have started their open play sequences 53 metres from their own goal line on average in the group stage, further up the pitch than any other side and impressively in the opposition half. Yes, you did read that correctly. It’s not only with the ball that Barcelona impress, as their ability to win possession back from opponents high up the pitch is second-to-none in the UWCL this season. Despite possessing the ball for almost three quarters of the time, they have forced the most high turnovers in the competition this season (128), with 29 of those ending shots and six directly leading to a goal. Unsurprisingly, they lead each category. Of Barcelona’s total regains of possession in the UWCL this season, 20% have come in the final third of the pitch, with midfielder Aitana Bonmati leading all players in this metric (14). Bonmati’s ability to win the ball high up the pitch has also helped her find positions to start attacks – her 12 secondary chances created (the pass before the chance created for a shot) are a competition high in 2021-22. She finds herself behind only teammate Alexia Putellas with regards to chances created and secondary chances created combined (20 vs. 31). This quarter-final tie will see the two most defensively-solid sides in the 2021-22 edition – with Barcelona’s record of one goal conceded in six games being trumped only by PSG’s phenomenal record of six clean sheets in the group stage. The Catalans have faced only 27 shots – fewer than any other side in the UWCL this season, despite facing two of the most potent sides in front of goal in the groups: Arsenal (14 goals) and Hoffenheim (11). Real Madrid are competing in their first UWCL season, so to make it through the group stage was an achievement – although being placed alongside Zhytlobud-1 Kharkiv and Breiðablik, it was expected that they would join PSG in qualifying for the quarter-finals. Their four games against those two teams in the group stage saw a cumulative score of 12-0, but coming up against an established, top-class opponent in PSG was a different proposition altogether, as they suffered 4-0 and 2-0 defeats. Barcelona will provide a level of opposition like that of PSG and judging on their league meetings since the start of 2020-21, Real Madrid have a lot to fear. Barcelona won 4-0 and 4-1 on the way to winning the 2020–21 Primera División by 25 points ahead of Real, and then 3-1 earlier this season before this weekend’s 5-0 victory to seal the league title on 13th March. In Real’s two games against PSG, they conceded 73% of their total group stage expected goals total, while allowing 14 shots on target – double what they faced in their four games against Zhytlobud-1 Kharkiv and Breiðablik combined (7). They also attempted just three shots on target in their two games against the French side, with none of those coming in the 4-0 defeat in Madrid. Despite suffering defeats in their two games against PSG, Real Madrid did try to keep possession – something Barcelona will be wary of. In fact, in their home match against them, Real kept more possession than the French club (51%). Neither of those matches against PSG came with current boss Alberto Toril in charge, however – he replaced David Aznar on 29th November. Since his arrival, Real Madrid have won 12 and lost three of their 15 competitive matches – the major issue, however, is that those three defeats have all come against Barcelona, with the two league defeats coming alongside a 1-0 loss in the Spanish Supercopa. The 12 wins have seen them concede just three goals overall – three times fewer than the three games versus Barca (9), so for any hope of causing a shock in this game then they’ll need to hope Barcelona somehow lose their firepower. Of the four quarter-final ties, this one will be the first to be decided on 30th March. The odds of reaching the semis and coming up against the winner of Arsenal and VfL Wolfsburg seem stacked in Barcelona’s favour, but Real Madrid will hope that they can spring a surprise and fly the Spanish flag in the competition as their only remaining participant.

11681,UWCL Players to Watch: The Knockout Stages,"Across the UWCL 2021-22 group stage, several players came to attention due to special qualities in their positions and roles. Of those that have made it through to the quarter finals, we pick out six to watch in the next round. In Tabea Waßmuth, Wolfsburg have the leading scorer in the UWCL so far this season, with eight goals – already two more than the 2020-21 top scorers achieved, with Jennifer Hermoso and Fran Kirby scoring six each. None of her eight goals have come from the penalty spot, while the Wolfsburg forward has attempted a competition-high tally of shots (33) and shots on target (15), while posting the highest expected goals total (5.2). Waßmuth has proved to be a reliable target in the opposition box, with all eight of her goals coming from inside the area – in every case, her only involvement in the goal move was to as the finisher. On average, she’s attempted a shot from inside the penalty area every 19 minutes – only PSG’s Kandidiatou Diani has done so more regularly (18 mins) – while her total of 55 touches inside the box is bettered by only Barcelona’s Caroline Hansen (58) in 2021-22. Her partnership with teammate Svenja Huth has been key, with six of her shots being created by Huth – that is a higher tally than any other player via a single teammates’ passes in the UWCL this season. The only match that she failed to score in during the group stage was on MD4 at home to Juventus, in a 2-0 defeat. Arsenal will be hoping to be just the second team to do this in 2021-22, when the two sides meet in the quarter finals. Jordyn Huitema is still only 20 years old but is setting the UEFA Women’s Champions League alight this season with her ability. Despite her young age, she’s scored six times in the 2021-22 edition and finds herself behind only Waßmuth (eight goals) in the scoring charts. Those six goals have come at an average of one every 47 minutes on average, while with an additional two assists, she’s involved in a goal every 35 minutes in the UWCL this season. One of the Canadian’s biggest qualities is her aerial threat. Despite her relatively few minutes of play, no other player in the competition has attempted as many headed shots as her (7), while she’s also scored a competition-high three headed goals. This is certainly useful for a team that put in the third-most open play crosses in the UWCL group stages (106). When receiving the ball in the final third of the pitch, no player in the UWCL is as dangerous as Alexia Putellas, who has all-around qualities in initiating, creating and finishing. She is, in general, highly visible in the final third, averaging 46 passes per 90 minutes in that area of the pitch – the highest in the competition. The 2021 Ballon d’Or Féminin winner has been involved in 62 attacking sequences in the UWCL so far this season – 11 more than any other player. 16 of those have seen her attempt the shot, 19 have been created by her and 27 have seen her involved in the build up to a Barcelona chance – clearly an integral part of their attacking play. Across the 429 minutes on pitch in the group stage, Putellas has been the leading creator of chances for teammates, either with the final pass before a shot or a key pass leading to the chance created – overall she’s managed 31 of these, which is 11 more than teammate Aitana Bonmati. Olympique Lyon’s left wing is the home of Selma Bacha. The 21-year-old Frenchwoman has created a competition-high 22 chances for teammates in this season’s UEFA Women’s Champions League so far, with 11 of those coming from set plays – another high. Her expected assists total of 2.37 also makes her the most dangerous player creatively in the UWCL this season, with her main threat coming from wide on the left in open play – only four players have created more chances from open play than she has (11), while she’s fired in the second-most open play crosses from the left of any player in the competition in 2021-22 so far (21). The left-footer already has three UWCL titles to her name, with Lyon’s victories in 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 – she’ll be hoping to add one more to that collection this season. Five-time UWCL winner Delphine Cascarino is one of the most threatening players at running with the ball at taking on opposition players in the competition this season. The French star has had a total of 34 take-ons, with 30 of them in the opposition half – a competition high. No player has beaten an opponent more often with a take on in the UWCL so far this season than she has (23), while she’s been involved in eight shots following a ball carry (three shots, five chances created) – more than any of her teammates. Her dribbling strength is especially dangerous because she always tries to generate added value for the team with her take-ons. On six occasions she tried to take multiple opponents out of the game with a single dribble, no player did so in the group stage more often. Of all Lyon players, Cascarino was the one to be involved in the most open play sequences leading to a shot in the group stages (27), while only Amandine Henry (8) dispossessed opponents more often to start an open play sequence for Lyon more often than she did (7). As we alluded to here, possession of the ball is key to Barcelona’s success and one player at the very centre of it is Mapi León. Among players who have played at least 90 minutes in the group stages, no one has averaged as many passes per 90 minutes as León (122). The 26-year-old was also incredibly accurate on those passes, hitting a teammate 95% of the time – a figure only surpassed by her teammate Andrea Pereira (97% – of players with at least 25 passes). In addition to this, León won 82% of her duels in the group stages, the best ratio among all players with more than 10 duels. Only Wolfsburg’s Lena Oberdorf (11) regained possession to start an open play sequence more often than León (10) in the UWCL group stages this season, while the Barcelona star was involved in the build-up to shots (not including creating or having the shot herself) on a competition-high 35 occasions. In this season’s Champions League, only Arsenal’s Simone Boye Sorensen had more carries per 90 minutes (33) than the Spaniard (31, at least 90 mins played). However, León is progressing much more upfield than any other player. Per 90 minutes, the Spaniard had 23 progressive carries – no other player more than 20.

11723,A Title-Decider? Looking Ahead to Chelsea vs. Arsenal in the WSL,"The Women’s Super League often seems to boil down to one crunch match which decides who wins the title. Recently, the team who has come out on top of those has been Chelsea. Back in 2019-20, Manchester City and Chelsea played out a 3-3 draw. Neither team knew it at the time, but that would be their final match following the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, and that single point was enough to see Chelsea take the title on points per game. A season later, they faced each other three games from the end of 2020-21, both aware that a win would more than likely seal the league crown. Once again, they drew, and once again it was Chelsea who went on to win the WSL title. On one hand, it feels simplistic to anoint Friday’s match between Arsenal and Chelsea as the title decider, given this season has been defined by its upsets – both these teams have dropped five points to opposition other than Manchester United or Manchester City. But conversely, recent history suggests that Chelsea could gain an overwhelming psychological advantage with a win in this match. There is a sense this year that neither Chelsea nor Arsenal have been entirely able to consistently perform at their very best over long spells. Arsenal started off the season incredibly brightly, defeating Chelsea 3-2 at the Emirates Stadium in the opening game before backing up their credentials with a spectacular 5-0 win against Manchester City only three weeks later. Across their first six games of 2021-22, Arsenal averaged 3.83 goals per game, but their underlying xG numbers (1.98 per game) suggested a downfall may soon arrive – but this didn’t take away the fact that they looked revitalised under new coach Jonas Eidevall. After six wins, the Gunners dropped their first league points of the season in the north London derby against Tottenham. That 1-1 draw was made even more frustrating with the injury to influential Leah Williamson with a hamstring tear. Up to and including that draw with Spurs, Williamson had been involved in 293 open play passing sequences in the WSL for Arsenal across the opening seven games, with 69 of those started by their captain – only one player produced more for the club than Williamson in both metrics over that spell. One of the main attributes that Williamson brings to Arsenal’s play is the ability to spray passes from the back to wide areas and quickly transition defence to attack in an instant. Of all Arsenal players in the Women’s Super League this season, Williamson has the longest average successful pass distance of 25 metres (over 411 passes), while of all players to have made at least 500 passes in the competition this season, no outfielder has averaged a longer successful pass distance. December’s 3-0 defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup final started a poor run of form that saw them win just one of seven competitive matches. The shock 2-0 loss to Birmingham in the WSL on 9th January was the nadir, with the Gunners thoroughly outplayed by the bottom-of-league club. Emma Hayes’ Chelsea side had a similarly bleak winter period. Despite winning the FA Cup with that dominant win over Arsenal, they contrived to get themselves knocked out of the Champions League following a 4-0 trouncing by Wolfsburg, when they only needed to avoid losing by more than two goals to progress. That was followed by a 1-0 defeat to Reading and a 0-0 draw with Brighton, as Chelsea went from having scored in 59 consecutive WSL matches to failing to score in back-to-back games in the competition. If you were to pick a player from each side that you’d expect to have the deciding influence on this fixture, Vivianne Miedema and Sam Kerr would have probably been your pick at the start of the season. Months down the line, however, it’s the impact of Arsenal’s Beth Mead and Chelsea’s Pernille Harder that have arguably shone in 2021-22 so far. Sam Kerr remains a cheat code for Chelsea but it is Pernille Harder who has particularly stood out this season. During Arsenal’s 3-2 win over Chelsea on the opening day, Mead scored twice and was the star of the show. Her opening goal was a fantastic left-footed strike, beating Chelsea goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger – one of only eight left-footed goals that Mead has scored in the WSL, contributing just 17% of her 46-goal total, which led to Berger reportedly telling the English forward that she “didn’t know [she] had a left foot,” post-match. With her assist against Brighton in January, Mead racked up her 35th in the Women’s Super League across her career – that tally matching the all-time competition record set by Karen Carney. Her next assist will see her move to outright top in the ranking. Pernille Harder, meanwhile, has looked particularly sharp for Chelsea over the past couple of games as she has taken on the side’s attacking mantle with Kerr away on duty with Australia at the Asian Cup. Now being predominantly used in a front two, she has had much more freedom to drift across the pitch than when she was playing in Hayes’ slightly more rigid 3-4-3 at the start of the season and 4-3-3 the season before.  Of course, for Hayes to play this system, she has to leave one of Sam Kerr or Fran Kirby out, but with Harder scoring five goals in her last six appearances for Chelsea, it seems a sacrifice worth making. Her movement helps Chelsea in attack and defence. It was not a coincidence how much control of the game Chelsea lost in their 1-0 win against Manchester City last weekend when Harder was substituted.  It is impossible to talk about this match without looking back at the two previous competitive meetings between Chelsea and Arsenal so far this season. The opening day matchup at The Emirates Stadium was a dream MD1 fixture for the Women’s Super League – a showpiece fixture in a great stadium to kick off both sides’ campaigns. Arsenal dominated Chelsea in a high-intensity battle, with Beth Mead running riot, to pick up their first WSL win over the reigning champions since October 2018. The images of Mead running towards fans at the Emirates with her arms outstretched and Jonas Eidevall sinking to his knees in celebration at the final whistle have become the standout photos of the season.  Three months later, in the FA Cup final, it was a completely different story. Chelsea had gone into that WSL season-opener with an under-strength squad, having given some of their side an extended break following the Olympics, so were without key attackers Sam Kerr and Fran Kirby. Both of those returned for the final, while Arsenal were missing their influential leader Leah Williamson at the back – a combination of factors that led to the Gunners wilting under the pressure. In the opening game of 2021-22, Arsenal allowed Chelsea to play without much pressure on the ball. Their PPDA value (passes allowed per defensive action) of 20.5 was their highest ever in a WSL match. Compare this to their seasonal average of 11.1 in every other match across the season combined, and you can see how much this was an outlier. Arsenal’s average open play sequence start distance in this 3-2 win was only 33.3m from their own goalline – the nearest to their own goal that’s been recorded in a WSL game on record since the 2015 season. In comparison, Chelsea’s was 41.3m from their goal, but this allowed Arsenal to exploit space in behind the Blues’ backline – something they did twice to score their opening two goals in that victory. For the FA Cup final, Chelsea changed tack. They pressed Arsenal a lot less – their PPDA fell from 12 in the WSL match to 16.6 in the FA Cup – but still constricted Arsenal to having the ball in their own half. Arsenal made 432 passes in their defensive and middle thirds, compared to Chelsea’s 217. When Chelsea did get the ball, they attacked quickly, putting together only two passing sequences of 10 or more passes in the whole game, and creating three direct attacks, scoring from one of them. Of course, some of this might have been influenced by game state – with Fran Kirby scoring after only three minutes, Chelsea were happy to sit back and see what Arsenal would come up with in response – but it was stark how different Hayes’ approach was. The FA Cup final showed that Hayes had learned from her chastening opening day loss to Eidevall. In fact, it has become a cornerstone of Hayes’ management that when she gets a second bite of the cherry, she seldom gets it wrong. Whether Jonas Eidevall can do the same could determine whether Arsenal win the league.

11757,"The WSL Catch Up: Miedema, Manager Changes & Manchester Rivals","The return of the Women’s Super League following a winter break has been hampered by the frequent postponement of matches due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Some teams are yet to even play a game in the competition in January, with the table looking more skewed week-by-week. Despite this, there are still some interesting storylines to catch up on in the WSL. The uncertainty surrounding Vivianne Miedema’s future at Arsenal has hung over the club for the past couple of seasons, with the Dutch striker being typically forthright about her interest in pursuing new challenges at some point. With her contract up at the end of the season, Arsenal have used the January transfer window to sign highly regarded Swedish striker Stina Blackstenius. It certainly seems like there are those of the club who have an eye on the future. On the field, though, there is also a sense that Miedema’s influence at the club is waning. On the face of it, scoring seven goals in nine starts is hardly poor form – only Sam Kerr has scored more this season. However, underneath there is a noticeable decline in the quality of opportunities coming Miedema’s way – by her impeccably high standards, at least. Like 2020-21, her overall goals per 90 average has dropped off from the heights of 2018-19 and 2019-20, but it’s still at 0.86/90 this season – an average not to be scoffed at. Both her non-penalty expected goals/90 and expected assists/90 are the lowest they’ve been since her debut WSL season in 2017-18, but just to show how much we’ve come to expect of the Dutch star – only Sam Kerr (0.92) has a higher npxG/90 than her this season in the competition. There’s little doubt that she is one of the best players the WSL has ever seen, and by looking at all outfielders per season since her debut campaign in 2017-18, it’s clear that not many players can consistently perform at her level season after season. Comparing Miedema’s shot map this season to last season, it’s clear that she’s not been able to find those deadly positions within the six-yard box, like she was with regularity in 2020-21. This could have been a result of the change in Arsenal management that took place over the summer. Joe Montemurro’s possession-based style has been replaced with Jonas Eidevall’s much quicker transitional style. Consequently, Miedema, who is well known for dropping deep, is not as able to advance as far up the pitch before an attacking sequence comes to an end.  Arsenal’s opening six WSL games of 2021-22 saw them outperform their xG total by 11.1, but in the four games since then this overperformance is just 0.4 which includes games against Spurs (one goal from 1.56 xG) and the defeat to Birmingham (no goals from 0.56 xG) where they found their performance in front of goal didn’t reflect the quality of chances presented to them. These results have now given Chelsea the initiative in the title race, so they need their guaranteed goals more than ever. Supplying Miedema with higher quality chances will be key if they are to win their first WSL title since 2019. Back in November, Birmingham City and Leicester City sacked their managers within one week of each other. Both sides were struggling in the league having picked up a combined total of just one point, but the new appointments of Darren Carter and Lydia Bedford seem to have immediately revitalised both City clubs and the relegation battle with it.  Birmingham began life under Carter with intent, after they twice took the lead against Manchester City before eventually losing 3-2 at St. Andrew’s thanks to an 89th minute winner from Ellen White. However, their first league victory of the season finally came on 9th January in surprising circumstances, beating league leaders Arsenal 2-0 in a well organised display. It was Arsenal that offered Bedford her first challenge in the WSL as Leicester boss, but the Gunners ran out 4-0 winners at Meadow Park. However, the following match against Birmingham on 19th December – at the time billed as a crunch relegation six-pointer, saw Bedford pick up her first points in charge with a 2-0 win. Since then, they have also gone on to beat an out-of-sorts Brighton team 1-0, last weekend. Before the arrivals of both Carter and Bedford, it seems that both clubs would have to be set scrapping draws and focus on beating one another in the WSL this season to achieve survival. However, those wins against Arsenal and Brighton have shown that they can collect a surprising result. It’s certainly been a baptism of fire for Carter since his arrival, with fixtures against Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United, and Manchester City. Leicester come up against Aston Villa this weekend, and a win would take them to just a point off their opponents in 10th position. Birmingham and Leicester meet again in the competition on 6th February, with both knowing that a win is vital to any chance of survival. The current London-based dominance of English women’s football has surely been frustrating for both Manchester clubs. In the past three seasons, only two trophies have been won by a team not from London, with Manchester City winning the FA Cup in 2019-20 and 2020-21, although that is predominantly because Chelsea have won the rest. Yet with the WSL title race looking set to be a two-horse race between Chelsea and Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United will surely be determined to make sure that it is not Tottenham who pick up the third and final Champions League spot. Fortunately for them, both sides look like their form has been rejuvenated thanks to two of their midfield star performers. At United, it’s undoubtedly Vilde Bøe Risa that seems to have been revealed as the missing piece of Marc Skinner’s puzzle. The Norwegian midfielder was highly sought after in the summer transfer window following spells in both her home country and Sweden, but she found game time hard to come by following an ineffective start as part of a midfield pairing alongside Katie Zelem. In those matches, United’s midfield ended up isolated, unable to link up defence and attack. It looked like Bøe Risa’s impact on the WSL was not going to be as strong as expected – until Marc Skinner moved her to a more advanced position on the pitch.  With Hayley Ladd now installed alongside Katie Zelem, Bøe Risa had licence to make more runs into the box. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News in December, the 26-year-old even accepted that her form earlier in the season stemmed from a struggle to transition to life in England; “This league is very different to what I have been used to and it’s much tougher now but I feel I can run more and be very offensive and do the runs in-behind.” She immediately made use of that to record seven shots in her first game higher up the pitch – against Brighton in December, with all of them hitting the target.  In fact, Bøe Risa ranks ninth across the WSL for shots on target (9), despite only having played three games so far this season in a more attacking role. Since her move forward at the start of December, she also has the highest non-penalty expected goals of any United player (1.18). Whilst her role means moving Ella Toone out to a wing, it also takes some of the opposition focus away from Toone, who’s so far this season shown herself to be United’s creative lynchpin. It remains to be seen how Skinner’s new midfield combination will hold up against more robust opposition, with United having so far only played Brighton, Aston Villa, and Birmingham City in this formation. Forthcoming fixtures against Arsenal and Manchester City in February will indicate whether this is a long-term solution for United.  On the other side of the city, Manchester City have recently been bolstered by the returns of long-term absentees Lucy Bronze and Steph Houghton, with a similar uptick in results against lesser opposition as Manchester United. But it is not the returnees who have been eye-catching, so much as Georgia Stanway.  The 23-year-old was previously seen as the future of this City side, until her rise was eclipsed by Lauren Hemp and Chloe Kelly. However, recent performances have shown why she was so highly rated – if she gets played in a position that suits her. It’s hard to not believe that Stanway’s progress has suffered somewhat in recent years due to her versatility. At both City and England, there is a tendency to use her to plug any gaps that might arise whether across the front line or the back line of a team. And whilst she is someone who can be relied upon do those jobs competently, they are rarely done exceptionally. As a result of this, it has not always been clear where exactly Stanway has been best suited. She ostensibly came through as a number 10 but recently it is in the number 8 role where she has looked best. The position allows her to combine the best aspects of her defensive and attacking play, and she has scored three times in the two games she has recently played there, helping her to equal last season’s goal tally already.  Of players to have played at least 500 minutes in the competition this season, only teammate Alex Greenwood and Everton’s Kenza Dali have carried the ball further per 90 minutes than Stanway, with her ball carrying skills proving a useful outlet for her club. She has led the City team in terms of shots in each of their past two games, with six against Brighton and four against Aston Villa. The range of her shooting also means she is well-suited to the differing opportunities that open to her from the midfield position.  There is a large amount of competition within Manchester City’s midfield with Keira Walsh and Caroline Weir both guaranteed starting positions when fit, leaving Vicky Losada, Filippa Angeldahl, Laura Coombs, and Stanway to compete for the third spot. However, as it stands, Stanway looks like City’s best option given her combination of skills. That is, until someone else gets injured.

11804,"The New Pretenders: Can Brighton, Tottenham or West Ham Really Keep up With the Very Best?","With two WSL games to go until the Christmas break, there is an unexpected trio of teams with their focus on the upper echelons of the table. Whilst Chelsea and Arsenal have steamed ahead of the rest of the pack in what is now certainly a two-horse title race, Manchester City’s disastrous start has left the historically closed-shop third placed position a bit more open. And with Manchester United also stuttering under new coach Marc Skinner, there are a new set of sides interested in the opportunity of Champions League football. All three of Brighton, Tottenham and West Ham have taken something of a ‘slow and steady’ approach to life in the Women’s Super League. Unlike Manchester United, who decided that the best way to make up for their historical refusal to have a women’s team was to go straight to the top, all three of these sides have steadily worked their way through the leagues. Whilst the backing of their men’s Premier League sides has hardly hindered them – only two WSL sides do not have a Premier League team backing them, compared to double that five years ago – they have not looked to ostentatiously splash the cash in the way Chelsea have done, for example. Yet there have been signs that these teams have always intended to move in this direction. Tottenham’s shock signing of Alex Morgan last summer showed that even though Morgan herself had little impact, they saw themselves as a potential destination for world-class players. Similarly, Brighton’s five-year plan back in 2015 aimed for Champions League football, whilst this year they spent money on a signing for the first time in their history, bringing in former Arsenal striker Danielle Carter from Reading. But even so, their starts to this WSL season have still been surprising. How have they done it, and are they capable of keeping it up? Tottenham, Brighton and West Ham have all improved by a greater margin defensively than they have offensively, but it is Tottenham who now have the meanest defence of all three. It is this defence which helped Tottenham pick up four points from two games against Arsenal and Manchester City (with a small bit of help from Rosella Ayane’s hand), conceding only two goals in the process. Under Rehanne Skinner, Tottenham this season have been a lot more effective at holding their shape and winning back the ball. It is no surprise that three of the five players with the most tackles in the league play for Spurs, with the side as a whole average 14.5 tackles won per 90 minutes, an increase of three per game over last season. As well as improving their tackling, Tottenham have also become a lot harder to play through, reducing the number of times per game they are dribbled past by an opponent (down to 2.9 this season from 5.0 last). In fact, it is telling that Brighton, Tottenham, and West Ham are three of the bottom four teams for this metric, with Chelsea being the fourth. It seems that all the sides aiming for that third spot have focused on staying compact to reduce the opportunities opponents might have to score. The graphic above shows the benefit of this. The number of shots that Tottenham are facing has not particularly declined, but the quality of each one on average – measured by xGA/shot – has dropped.  The addition of Maéva Clemaron in midfield has also given Ria Percival the freedom to get forward more from a midfield position. This season, the number of chances Percival creates per 90 has almost doubled from 5.9 to 10.8, and the pass map from Clemaron to Percival shows how the French midfielder loves to find the Kiwi with direct forward passes. Percival’s chance creation will become even more essential after Kit Graham damaged her ACL, ruling her out for the rest of the season. Graham has been the creative hub of Tottenham, creating more chances from open play than anyone else in the side, as well as scoring a quarter of their goals in the league this season. As the attacking sequence involvements graphic below shows, Graham has been involved in by far the most shots for Tottenham so far this season, taking more shots and creating more chances than anyone else.  If Skinner’s side are to keep up the pace they’ve set for themselves, they’ll need to bring in another creative player in the January transfer window. Whilst Tottenham have worked on beefing up their midfield in order to disrupt opponents on the ball there, Brighton have taken a more holistic view to improving their defence this year. Hope Powell’s side have switched from the back four they played last season to a back three, with wonderkid Maya Le Tissier moving from the right back position that saw her catch everyone’s attention to become the right-sided centre back in a back three. This shift has allowed Powell to play Emma Koivisto as a wing back with Le Tissier linking up with her. Le Tissier’s on the ball ability has allowed Brighton to have an extra attacking option from their defence. Only two defenders have played more passes into the box than Le Tissier this season, whilst only Inessa Kaagman has created more chances for the club than Le Tissier. Le Tissier’s pass map shows how she will often get extremely high up the pitch to support Brighton’s attacks. The formation shift has also helped Brighton out defensively, with the Sussex side’s expected goals against per 90 falling from 1.7 to 1.0, a level of solidity that is comparable to Everton and exceeds Manchester United. The number of shots on target they are facing has also declined from 5.6 to 3.8. Brighton have also benefited from goalkeeper Megan Walsh’s ability this season, with Walsh conceding just seven goals from an expected 7.2 on target. Walsh is one of just two goalkeepers in the league to have conceded less than expected to, alongside Manuela Zinsberger of Arsenal. Yet despite Brighton’s successful efforts to bring some additional solidity to their backline, they have been unable to make many improvements going forward, despite the signing of Dan Carter. Her expected goals per 90 of just 0.2 ranks her 22nd of all WSL forwards to have played at least four games. A goal against Chelsea showed her quality, but if Brighton are to continue to have a shot at the top three, they will need her to get in better positions. West Ham are easily the weakest of the three teams aiming to upset the WSL status quo, with an expected goal difference of -1.8 actually ranking them 8th in the league. Yet Olli Harder’s side have shown glimpses of quality that if they could demonstrate consistently, would make them a fearsome side to play against. Much like Tottenham, West Ham have excelled in midfield with the signing of Yui Hasegawa offering them guile alongside the efficiency of Dagný Brynjarsdóttir. Opposition teams have struggled to deal with Brynjarsdóttir’s late runs into the box, although she has struggled to convert her easier chances as efficiently as she might like.  Similarly, the loan signing of Lisa Evans from Arsenal has been a great addition to a side who have not always been blessed with lots of threatening attacking players. Despite missing a number of games through injury, Evans has established herself as a key part of this West Ham team as a right wing-back. Both of these players’ ability to get forwards more than their position might expect has seen West Ham end up with the fifth highest number of touches in the opposition box, with the traditional top four all ahead of them. Given how hard weaker teams find it to gain footholds higher up the pitch, capitalising on this kind of territory could be crucial for West Ham across the rest of the season. But West Ham have struggled to keep their concentration in games, dropping six points from winning positions this season. No side in the WSL has dropped more. Draws against Aston Villa and Reading both came about as a result of injury time equalisers, showing a serious inability to see out a match. West Ham will hope that the return of Grace Fisk to the starting line-up might give them a bit more control, with Fisk being one of only five players across the whole league to play every single minute of last year. Given West Ham have improved their defence on the face of it, it might not seem like her presence has been that much of a loss but as one of England’s most promising young centre backs, her return will give the Hammers confidence that their defensive form could improve further. Tottenham, Brighton and West Ham have been able to assert themselves on the table this season as much thanks to the poor start of Manchester United, Manchester City and Everton, as it is due to their own improvement. Looking at their expected goal difference, Tottenham are the only one of the three who look like they could be a genuine contender later on in the season, with Manchester City clearly having reason to feel a bit hard done by from some of their results this year. However, there’s reason to hope the trends seen from these teams so far this season could improve further as the season goes on. Given the way these teams have tackled top-flight football over the past couple of years, they will see their position at this stage of the season as evidence that slow and steady can win the race.

11833,Checking In: The WSL Recap,"The stop-start nature of this season’s Women’s Super League has seen teams struggle to find much consistency, and the gap at the top of the league has closed to just one point.  That follows Arsenal’s surprise 1-1 draw with Tottenham, with Chelsea’s comprehensive victory over Manchester City allowing them to pull back two points from the Gunners. City have continued to struggle, as they find themselves in ninth place with as many points as Everton and Reading. Meanwhile Brighton and Tottenham are just about holding on to their positions around the remaining Champions League spot. For all Gareth Taylor has complained about injuries affecting his side, Manchester City are still performing well below what is expected from the XI’s he has been able to field. What is particularly noticeable about City this season is how unable they are to turn possession into pressure, with their 5-0 and 4-0 losses to Arsenal and Chelsea respectively seeing them have most of the ball. Game state is obviously part of possession statistics – Chelsea being gifted a goal by City a minute into the game made it easier to sit back – but the problem can also be seen in City’s passing sequences. No side has had more passing sequences from open play containing 10+ passes than Manchester City – their total across this season of 79 puts them level with Chelsea. That seems fine, but not when there doesn’t seem to be any plan with what to do with those passing moves. Reigning champions Chelsea have seen just under 27% of their sequences end with either a shot or a touch in the opposition box – way higher than City’s ratio of 16.5%. Despite regular periods of possession, City have been unable to get the ball into any areas of danger to the opposition on a regular basis – backed up by the fact that they are the slowest team at progressing the ball up field in the WSL this season, moving the ball up the pitch at a rate of only 0.88m/s. Even when City have managed to get a shot away in 2021-22, their shots have been of lower quality than we’ve come to expect from them over recent years. Their average xG per non-penalty shot of 0.09 (essentially efforts with a 9% conversion rate expectation, based on the quality) is well below a consistent 0.13 average from recent seasons. This is particularly problematic when your striker is a player like Ellen White, who likes to poach from within the six-yard box. The fact that White’s average shots per 90 has not declined, but her shots on target per 90 has dropped from an average of 1.37 over the past two seasons to just 0.74 demonstrates City’s problem. Not only is this “over-playing” effecting their attacking output, we’ve seen City concede goals at an alarming rate from turnovers of possession deep in their own half in 2021-22. They have already conceded a league-high five goals from high turnovers this season – the other 11 teams in the league have conceded nine as a combined total. If Manchester City are to mount a challenge for the third Champions League spot, Taylor might need to change the style of play going forward. There are not many teams who after scoring zero goals in their first four games, go on to score eight in their next three matches, but Reading have done just that in WSL 2021-22, turning their fortunes around. Those eight goals have seen Kelly Chambers’ side pick up seven points – most recently snatching a last-minute equaliser in a 2-2 draw with West Ham, in which the East London side had dominated. However, if we look at the underlying numbers from this trigger-happy Reading team, all is not quite what it seems. Despite scoring more goals than Everton, and almost as many as fourth place Tottenham, Reading’s expected goals is only 4.58. Whilst it might be understandable for it to be relatively low given Reading’s torrid start to the season, the fact that close to half of it comes from a 3-0 win against hapless Birmingham shows that the Royals’ recent form might have more to do with luck than judgement. A 3-0 win against Aston Villa came from an expected goals of 0.37 and the two goals against West Ham from only 0.31. In fact, the match against Birmingham aside, Reading’s numbers have sat consistently around the 0.2-0.4 mark. If there is some sense of hope for Reading that they could continue this rather unlikely attacking streak it will likely be down to Deanne Rose’s involvement. The 22-year-old Olympic gold medallist has seen her touches in the opposition box beginning to increase recently, and she looks set to be Reading’s brightest attacking spark this season. Her first four appearances saw her make just nine touches in the opposition box across 247 minutes, but in her two most recent games against Birmingham and West Ham, her tally has been 14 overall. Although Chelsea went in 2-0 up at half-time against Manchester City, they had not managed to have control of large swathes of the first half, with their goals coming via an awful pass from Karima Benameur Taieb being intercepted by Jessie Fleming, and a Sam Kerr tap in from a counter-attack. Emma Hayes’ response was swift; she replaced Ji So-Yun with Sophie Ingle to stop Chelsea getting overrun in midfield. Hayes has fiddled with the double pivot of her new look 3-4-3 quite a lot this season. With Ji, Melanie Leupolz, Fleming, Ingle and Drew Spence all picking up minutes in those positions, there is a sense that Hayes has not quite settled on who her preferred choices are. The reality is that Hayes probably sees this very variable set of midfielders in different ways and is happy to select the appropriate one based on the situation. Against City, Ingle felt ideal to regain control in midfield. Despite a quickfire double at the start of the second half left Chelsea with plain sailing for the last 35 minutes, she has shown herself to be adept at bringing a sense of calm to Chelsea. Of the 63 players to have attempted 200+ passes in the WSL this season, only 11 have done so with 85% accuracy or higher – one of these is Ingle. Hayes clearly sees Ingle’s role in the Chelsea side as being a dependable player who will look to shield the defence and keep hold of the ball well. Whilst she might not be required to start every game, her role in Chelsea’s squad is indispensable. As frustrating as it was for Arsenal to drop their first points of the season against Tottenham in the north London derby, they were struck with another blow when the club announced that defender Leah Williamson will be out until the new year with a hamstring injury picked up during the game. Williamson has played in all seven of Arsenal’s WSL matches so far this season and is crucial to their build-up play. Williamson’s ball-playing ability regularly sees her listed alongside Alex Greenwood, Millie Bright, and Magda Eriksson as one of the best centre-backs in possession in the WSL. She ranks second for Arsenal for proportion of the teams sequences she was involved in across 2021-22 (28%), behind only Noelle Maritz (30%). She has also made the most ball carries for the Gunners in the WSL this season, both overall (74) and progressively up field (57). Brighton’s injury-time winner at the weekend condemned Leicester City to having the worst start of any WSL team since Yeovil Town in 2017-18. They have lost all seven of their league matches played so far and will be hoping their run of zero points does not stretch as far as Yeovil’s did three seasons ago when they lost their opening twelve games. Astonishingly, Yeovil were not relegated in 2017-18, thanks to a reprieve as a result of Sunderland going into administration. Leicester meanwhile have Birmingham’s equally poor form to thank for keeping them even within touching distance of staying in the division. However, the underlying numbers suggest that problems at both ends of the pitch may hamper Leicester more than Birmingham. Leicester’s main problem is their defence, with the newly promoted side conceding a large number of high quality chances in every game. Their xG conceded per game stands at 1.93, which is the worst in 2021-22 but well below Yeovil’s average in both 2017-18 (3.49) and 2018-19 (2.82) and is even lower than Bristol City last season (2.31) and in 2019-20 (2.58). Since the formation of the WSL, Leicester (21) are one of only five teams to have allowed opponents an average of 21+ shots per game in a single season. The reality for both Birmingham and Leicester is that this term will likely be a slow slog all the way until the end of the season to see who can pick up the most points. When the likely points totals are this low, any results can swing the table in a totally different direction, as has been the case with Reading suddenly picking up seven points in three games without much noticeable improvement. To do something like this, though, Leicester will need to significantly enhance their defending to stand any chance of not returning to the Championship.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2021/11/wsl-stats-recap-nov-18/,Jesse Parker Humphreys,18/11/2021 7:16,the-analyst
11845,All about Mead: Arsenal’s Influential Star,"Arsenal have made a tremendous start to the season and much of that has been down to their most influential player right now, Beth Mead. Rob Bateman delves deeper. After a decent end to the last campaign and a summer of investment, Arsenal have a 100% record in the Barclays Women’s Super League and have scored 55 goals in 15 matches in all competitions. They are on a run of 14 wins and no defeats in their last 15 WSL matches, reached the FA Cup final and are well set to qualify in their Champions League group. The Gunners have a deep squad and are blessed with some great players such as Leah Williamson, Kim Little and Vivianne Miedema among others, but right now it’s Beth Mead that has the strongest claim to being their most effective player. Mead joined the Gunners in 2017 after starting out at Sunderland, scoring 18 goals and registering just four assists in two top-flight seasons with the Black Cats. Her role at her former club saw Mead lead the line as a striker, with her much higher goal tally than number of assists being reflective of that. She may have been allocated the number nine shirt at Arsenal, but her role with the Gunners has become more of a roving forward, equally adept at supporting a main striker from central or wide positions, in turn allowing her to become both scorer and creator. This season, Mead has the joint-most goal involvements in the FAWSL, with her eight contributions split equally between goals and assists. In her career with the north Londoners, she has scored 27 and assisted 30 goals in the FAWSL. It means she now sits joint-third in the all-time rankings for goal involvements in the competition with 79. Mead raised her tally of assists to 34 on Sunday in Arsenal’s 4-0 win over West Ham and now just sits one behind the all-time record holder, Karen Carney who has a total of 35. With the Gunners facing north London rivals Tottenham on Saturday, the Whitby-born forward could equal or even surpass Carney’s record if she assists against Spurs this weekend. She already has one against Tottenham in the FA Cup this season in a 5-1 triumph back in September. When you look at her assists on a pitch map, it’s evident that she mostly likes to supply teammates from inside the area as opposed to throwing in hopeful crosses and creates high-quality chances for fellow Gunners players. Mead already broke a FAWSL record this season for goals assisted from open play when she set up Miedema for a goal against Reading to overtake Nikita Parris’ tally of 25, but Sunday’s assist against the Hammers saw her pull clear once again of Fran Kirby who had matched her total in recent games. Mead has currently accrued 29 goal assists from open play – more than anyone in the competition. She already holds the record for most goal assists in a single FAWSL campaign too, setting up 12 goals in the 2018-19 season. And she has a particularly productive relationship with Vivianne Miedema, setting up the Dutch striker for 12 goals, which is the most prolific combination in Women’s Super League history ahead of Fran Kirby to Sam Kerr (10 times). This season, Mead has four assists and is tucked in behind Kerr who has five. But looking at expected assists – which show how many goals the average player might have expected to have created given the chances they have laid on, Mead is the leader by far this season with 2.8 xA overall (2.7 from open play), highlighting her creative prowess. Unlike metrics such as assists or chances created, xA isn’t reliant on the recipient of a pass getting a shot away, so it shows how she has been able to create situations for teammates in positions which give them the best chance of finding the net. Mead has also created more chances in total than any other player and will be an integral part of Arsenal’s challenge to dethrone Chelsea at home and challenge the best teams in Europe over the coming campaign – 23 of the 24 she has set up have also been from open play. Her incredible season has also been embellished with a hat-trick for England, making her the first woman to score an international hat-trick at Wembley. At 26 years of age, there is still time for Mead to create more goals, set new records and add to Arsenal’s impressive trophy haul in the Women’s game.

11877,Red vs. Blue: The WSL Manchester Derby Preview,"Manchester United have won six of their last seven WSL games, while Manchester City are on a disastrous run of three successive losses. But this is a derby and we know form often goes out of the window. The fortunes of the two Manchester teams in the Women’s Super League have taken some by surprise this season. Manchester City were thought to have had a very strong transfer window, bringing in signings like Bunny Shaw and Vicky Losada to strengthen their attack and midfield. More question marks hung over Manchester United after the departure of Casey Stoney, alongside a number of key players. The two sides face each other in the first Manchester derby of the season in what already looks like it could be a make-or-break game. Manchester City’s poor form shows no sign of arresting itself with the side losing three consecutive games in the WSL for the first time ever. After losing 2-0 to West Ham at home last weekend, they are currently in ninth place with only three points from their opening day win against Everton. The collapse has been spectacular – this is a team who were expected to challenge for the title but who now look well and truly out of that race. On the face of it, the losses to Tottenham and West Ham might seem like they had more to do with bad luck than what was occurring on the pitch. Yet the underlying numbers do not cover Man City in glory either. Looking at expected goals for and against across the opening four games of the season, sides have split into three chunks, with Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham out in front. Manchester City, meanwhile, are firmly in the middle chunk alongside West Ham, Brighton and Everton. City might not deserve to be in ninth position, but they certainly are not anywhere near the top of the table either.  As shown by the interactive data table above (yes, you can click on it), City’s overall xG against stands at 4.7, with non-penalty xG faced at 1.4 – that 29% ratio is higher than any other team in the competition in 2021-22 and seven percentage points above the next most (Spurs – 22%). The only team to have conceded better chances to opponents from non-penalty shots are struggling Leicester City (1.7). With Manchester City missing three of their usual starting defence in Lucy Bronze, Steph Houghton and Ellie Roebuck, it seems that Gareth Taylor’s side have struggled to organise themselves appropriately. In fact, being without the experienced Houghton has affected Manchester City over the years and it’s not just a problem specific to 2021-22. Since she signed for the club in January 2014, Man City have recorded much better results with her in the side than without (71% win ratio vs. 53%) and have also conceded more goals per game without her playing. It’s also been a poor season in attack, overall. Yes, they started the season with a 4-0 demolition of Everton at Goodison Park, but since then the season has been nothing short of disastrous. Of the five seasons of xG data that we have for WSL, this is Manchester City’s worst for xG per game from non-penalty shots (1.35), shot quality (0.09xG per non-pen shot) and it’s the worst shots per game average (15.3) that City have had in a WSL season since 2014 (11.6). Under Marc Skinner, United have looked to shed some of the direct style that was part of Casey Stoney’s game plans. Stoney’s United ranked fifth in terms of how quickly they moved the ball up the field, progressing it at 1.5 m/s. Skinner’s United, however, are now the second slowest team when it comes to ball progression, moving at 1.05 m/s. However, there is some evidence that United’s players have not yet been able to make the most out of this style of play. Despite progressing the ball very slowly, United have only managed 28 open play passing sequences of 10+ passes. That is only the fifth most in the league, and far below that of the top four who all have 44 or above. Even though United move the ball slowly, they are not as competent at holding onto it for long periods of time. So far, Manchester United have looked like one of the most attack-minded sides in the league. They fall only behind Chelsea in terms of the number of shots taken so far this season, with only Chelsea or Arsenal creating more big chances. What’s interesting is that despite attempting the second-most shots (75) and having a non-penalty xG total (7) below only Chelsea (9.4), United have had the same quality shots on average as their rivals City (0.09xG per shot) – they have just attempted more of them and been slightly more clinical, converting 10.7% compared to City’s 8.2%. There are clear signs that Skinner is making his mark on this Manchester United side, but to truly challenge at the top of the table, they will need to be more accurate with their shooting and be stronger in possession.   This will be the fourth occasion Manchester City and Manchester United have faced each other in the WSL, with United having only picked up one point from their first three meetings. Ellen White will be hoping she can end her slow start to the season against United, who are the only WSL side that she has never scored against. White is yet to score in the WSL, and of players with no goals in the first four games, only Tottenham’s Ria Percival has a higher individual xG total than White (1.58 to White’s 1.45). United will believe they have never been in a better position to gain a first WSL win over their rivals. With City struggling, a win for United would cement themselves as favourites to claim the third Champions League spot that eluded them last year. Meanwhile, Gareth Taylor will feel like he must win to stay in his job; a fourth consecutive loss – after an exit in the Champions League at the qualification stage – would only confirm that their season is a write off.

11883,UEFA Women’s Champions League 2021-22: The Biggest Season Yet,"The new UEFA’s Women’s Champions League campaign kicks off this week, with this being the first edition to feature a 16-team group stage since the inaugural tournament in 2001-02. We look back over some of the records from the competition ahead of this year’s edition. The UEFA Women’s Champions League – previously called the UEFA Women’s Cup between 2001-2009 – will be the 21st edition of Europe’s premier women’s football competition. Back in 2001-02, eight teams participated with German side Frankfurt taking the title following a 2-0 final win against Sweden’s Umeå IK. Fast forward to 2021 and the tournament will have 16 teams competing in four groups of four, followed by knockout stages and concluding with a final in Juventus Stadium in Torino. Among the 16 teams competing in the group stages are four former winners of the event, Lyon, Wolfsburg, Arsenal and the defending champions FC Barcelona. On the flip side, there are also three first timers to the event with HB Koge, Hoffenheim and Real Madrid each playing in their first UWCL campaign. Here, we look back over some of the key records and achievements witnessed in the competition across it’s 20-year existence. 2021 saw Barcelona win their first ever UWCL title with an emphatic 4-0 victory over Chelsea. This meant that the competition had a new winner for the first time since 2013, when Wolfsburg won their maiden title with a 1-0 win against Lyon. It is Lyon that hold the most titles in the competition with seven – five of these coming in consecutive seasons between 2016-2020, also a competition record. The French club have played in a competition-high nine finals, while it is another French club that hold the unwanted record of reaching the most finals without having won the trophy: Paris Saint-Germain (2). Only one English club has won the title, with Arsenal’s victory in 2007 coming thanks to an Alex Scott goal in the first leg (1-0 on aggregate) against Umeå IK. Both Arsenal and Chelsea participate in the group stages in 2021-22, looking to end that 15-year wait for the title by English clubs. Unsurprisingly as the most successful side in the history of the UEFA Women’s Champions League, Lyon, have played a competition-high 113 matches. None of the three clubs behind them in rankings have reached the semi-finals in any of the last five editions, with Frankfurt doing this most recently in 2015-16. Lyon’s biggest threat over the past decade has come from German powerhouses Wolfsburg, with them playing in five finals since the rebrand of the competition in 2009-10, but all three losses coming at the hands of the seven-time winners (2016, 2018, 2020). Arsenal will be adding at least six more matches to their current total of 88, as they appear in the group stage in 2021-22. If they were to go all the way to the final, they’d still be under the 100-game mark (99). Lyon’s Wendie Renard has made 95 appearances in the UEFA Women’s Champions League, making her the most experienced player in the history of the competition. Renard was part of all of Lyon’s seven title-winning squads, making her one of the three most decorated players in the history of the UWCL, together with teammates Sarah Bouhaddi and Eugénie Le Sommer. There’s every chance that Renard will break the century of appearances in the competition in 2021-22, with Lyon in Group D alongside Bayern Munich, BK Häcken and Benfica. Wolfsburg’s Alexandra Popp and Renard’s teammate Le Sommer should also move to outright second place and third place respectively, this season. Popp is currently tied on 81 appearances with Camille Abily, but with Abily now retired she won’t be adding to her tally. Ada Hegerberg’s 53 goals in the UWCL have helped her finish as the competition top scorer on two previous occasions, winning the award in 2017-18 (15 goals) and in 2015-16 (13 goals). That effort in 2017-18 remains the highest scoring individual season by a player in the competition. She’s played for three clubs across her career in the competition – Stabæk, Turbine Potsdam and Lyon – and will be looking to add to her tally in 2021-22 after a terrible period with injury. The 2018 Ballon d’Or winner ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament in January 2020 and has spent considerable time on the sidelines. The absence of one of the best players in women’s football was a major reason behind Lyon’s failure to win a UWCL title for the first time since 2015-16, but she’ll be expected to help them challenge this time around. Estonian side Pärnu probably feared the worst when they were drawn against UWCL holders and eventual champions Wolfsburg in the 2013-14 round of 32. The first leg of the tie in Estonia saw Wolfsburg walk away with a 14-0 win, breaking the record for the biggest win in the history of the competition. Lina Magull opened the scoring in the eighth minute and the German side never looked back – leading 6-0 at half-time and adding eight more strikes in the second half. Magull scored four goals in total in that game, with her teammates Martina Müller and Conny Pohlers each adding hat-tricks.Wolfsburg came very close to equalling this victory in the second-leg at home, winning 13-0, giving them the biggest win on aggregate (27-0) in the history of the UWCL as well. This 14-0 win is also tied for the highest scoring match in the history of the UEFA Women’s Champions League, level with another Wolfsburg victory – in October 2017, they defeated Atlético Madrid 12-2. Including qualifiers, the biggest win in UWCL competition would be Apollon’s 21-0 win over Ada Velipojë in the 2012-13 qualification campaign.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2021/10/uefa-womens-champions-league-records/,Michael Prasthofer,04/10/2021 6:39,the-analyst
11887,Fran’s 50: Kirby Hits a WSL Landmark,"Last weekend Fran Kirby became just the third player in WSL history to score 50 goals. We delve into the data to see what makes her such a special talent. When Chelsea signed Fran Kirby from Reading back in 2015, it marked their emergence at the top table of women’s football in England. The switch came at a time where interest in women’s football was piquing, and the race to sign Reading’s star forward was one of the first women’s transfer sagas to capture the attention of the media. With Kirby’s signature secured, the cup-tied player sat in the stands as Chelsea won their first piece of major silverware, the 2015 FA Cup, at Wembley. A new chapter had opened for the London club. Since then, Chelsea and Kirby have gone on to win eight major honours together with Kirby becoming Chelsea’s all-time top scorer in December 2020. She joined a high-profile list at the weekend by scoring her 50th goal in the WSL, becoming only the third player to reach the half-century, joining Ellen White and Vivianne Miedema as one of the most prolific scorers the league has ever seen. This is how she has done it. Fran Kirby only took eleven minutes to score her first goal for Chelsea, coming off the bench to add a fourth to Chelsea’s tally against Birmingham City. With her third and fourth goal for the club, she helped secure them their first league title as they beat Sunderland 4-0 in 2015. Her goals have gone on to help Chelsea to wins against Manchester City, Arsenal, and Manchester United. Her journey to 50 was interrupted when she missed the vast majority of the 2019-20 season due to a diagnosis of pericarditis, which she thought might lead her to never playing football again. But she returned to the Chelsea side in startling form, scoring 16 goals in the 2020-21 campaign – the most she had ever managed in a single season. Part of why Kirby has been able to reach 50 goals, despite spending a large amount of time on the sidelines, is how economical she is when it comes to scoring. Her 50 goals have come in only 52 WSL starts, and she scores a goal, on average, every 102 minutes on the pitch. Of players with more than 30 WSL goals, only Miedema scores more frequently. Of her half-century of goals, only two have come from the penalty spot, whilst she has scored 32 with her right foot, 13 with her left, and somewhat surprisingly, five with her head. Given that she is one of the shortest players in the WSL, she has been remarkably successful at going undetected when it comes to heading in goals, demonstrating just how good her movement is in the box. She is also one of only three players to score four or more goals in a single game, doing so against her former club Reading last season, joining only Vivianne Miedema and Bethany England in that exclusive club within the WSL. Reading are just one of a couple of teams who Kirby seems to relish playing against. She scored her fastest hat-trick against them, requiring only 31 minutes to put three past Grace Moloney. Only against Bristol City has she been more prolific in the WSL, with the recently relegated Robbins conceding nine goals to the Chelsea star over the years. Kirby stands out from Miedema and White in reaching 50 goals because she does not play as a traditional striker for Chelsea. Her role is a lot more creative, having been used as a 10, off the right, or in a front two. Regardless of where she plays on the pitch, Kirby is always central to Chelsea’s attacking play, whether in the build-up or finishing. She is ruthlessly efficient in front of goal. When it comes to shot conversion rate, Kirby scores 23.4% of her shots. For players who have scored more than 30 goals in the WSL, only Kim Little has done better (24%). She also excels at turning seemingly low-quality opportunities into goals. Last season Kirby scored a career high of 16 goals in a single season, from an expected goals total of 7.1. No player has ever outperformed their xG total across a season in the WSL by more. She’s not traditionally been a significant over-performer of expected goals, so we can probably expect her hot streak to tail off a bit this season, although having scored twice in Chelsea’s opening three games, it is not currently showing any signs of fading. Kirby’s peak form last season came alongside Chelsea’s top scorer Sam Kerr. Kerr was initially signed whilst Kirby was out of the side with pericarditis, and she has admitted that she feared that Kerr was there to replace her. Instead, the duo have formed an almost telepathic connection which Chelsea boss Emma Hayes has compared to Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole. Kerr has assisted Kirby more often (6) than any other Chelsea player has in the WSL. Kirby returned the favour too, with the two players combining to create 12 goals for one another in the WSL in 2020-21, breaking the record of eight previously set by Beth Mead and Miedema in 2018-19. Their connection has continued this year, combining for three goals already in 2021-22 – including fittingly Kirby’s 50th goal – all coming in Chelsea’s 6-1 win against Manchester United last weekend. Kirby has long been recognised as one of the most talented players in the Women’s Super League and her inclusion in the ‘Fifty Club’ is simply more evidence of the impact she has had on the game. With Chelsea looking set to continue their attacking dominance this season – no team has scored more goals in their opening three games – there is no doubt that she will be adding to her total and reaching a new landmark in the future.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2021/09/fran-kirby-hits-50-wsl-goals/,Jesse Parker Humphreys,30/09/2021 7:20,the-analyst
11899,"Two Down, 22 to Go: WSL So Far","In the blink of an eye, the Women’s Super League has completed two gameweeks and hurriedly rushed everyone off to an international break. So now is the perfect time to lift the lid on some of the trends that have stood out in the first two games. Traditionally in the Women’s Super League, pressing has been the preserve of the elite. The ‘top three’ of Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal have used it to turn the screw against the smaller sides, whilst everyone else has looked to sit back and defend for their lives. This year, however, has hinted at a change of approach from certain teams. Newcomers Leicester City might be near the bottom of the league but they are top of the PPDA (Passes per Defensive Action) table averaging 7.1 over the first two matchdays. It’s a tactic that should at least have merited them points on the opening day against Aston Villa where they outperformed them 1.85 to 0.76 on expected goals, but they conceded twice in the space of two minutes from their only two shots on target faced to lose the game.  Villa themselves have also employed a more intense pressing strategy this season. There were some question marks about how Carla Ward would adjust the ultra-conservative style employed by Birmingham to Aston Villa this year – so far it has paid dividends with Villa coming from behind twice to pick up four points against Leicester and West Ham. High-flyers Brighton, who are currently the surprise leaders of the WSL with six points, seven goals, and none conceded, have also added an additional intensity to their game this season. Although their PPDA figure might be slightly skewed by the fact they played 60 minutes against 10 players of West Ham on the opening weekend of the season, Hope Powell’s side have certainly started with intent racking up their biggest ever WSL win against Birmingham City on the last Sunday of action. As the season wears on, these figures may well decrease but for now it suggests that a number of sides feel much more capable of taking the game to their opponents than perhaps they have done in the past. Who knows what football managers get up to on their summer holidays, but if the start of the WSL is anything to go by it appears they’ve have been studying recent tactical deployments by Thomas Tuchel/Antonio Conte/Gareth Southgate (delete as appropriate based on your favourite purveyor of a back three). The three centre-back approach has been taking the league by storm with varying degrees of success so far. The most eye-catching has been Emma Hayes’ decision to move away from the midfield diamond that led Chelsea to a league title and Champions League Final last season, in favour of a new 3-4-3. The Blues struggled with the formation against Arsenal, losing 3-2 and their centre-backs were ruthlessly exposed at points, but a positional switch between Jess Carter and Millie Bright saw them saunter to a 4-0 win against Everton. Hayes’ side and West Ham are the only clubs to use a back three for both their games this season, with the east London side one of the few teams to do this last year following Olli Harder’s appointment as coach. Results have not gone their way so far but the loan signing of Lisa Evans to play wing-back combined with Adriana Leon’s placement in a front two alongside Claudia Walker looks like it could be very effective as the season goes on. Everton, meanwhile, are a side who look like they have intended to play a back three but have actually ended up with a back five against both Manchester City and Chelsea. The Toffees have endured a horrendous start to the season, not aided by the fact that Leonie Maier – the right-back they signed to replace Ingrid Moe Wold – missed the opening two matches through lack of fitness. This has led to centre-back Rikke Sevecke and right-winger Nicoline Sorensen filling in with little success. Willie Kirk will likely want to give the formation another crack against weaker opposition, given his side are front-loaded with attacking talent, but it has not been a great advert for it so far. Whether sides are just looking for a cautious start to the season or if this is representative of a real shift is unclear. Chelsea’s reason for switching has supposedly been because of an inability to recruit full backs in the summer, although as we will see further on, it has also had some intended beneficial consequences. If the shift is real though, based on what has happened in the Premier League previously, we could end up seeing more and more sides converting to a back three over the season. It would be unfair to call Pernille Harder’s first season in the WSL a disappointment, but it is undeniable that she did not have the impact many would have expected. Harder has created high standards for herself, having won UEFA Player of the Year twice, but the forward recorded her lowest domestic goalscoring season since 2016-17 by scoring only nine goals from the tip of Emma Hayes’ midfield diamond in 2020-21. Chelsea’s switch to a 3-4-3 this season seems to have freed up the Danish international. Now playing as the left inside-forward, she is already getting into more promising shooting positions and linking up better with Sam Kerr and Fran Kirby. In this system, Harder is now taking more touches in the opponent’s box (9 per 90 vs 5.9 last season), more likely to shoot from inside the box (4.5 p90 vs 2.3), and more likely to shoot in general (5.5 p90 vs 3.8), while she’s also registered the highest non-penalty xG total of any WSL player so far this season (1.27). The focus has been on Chelsea using a back three to distract from their lack of full backs, but perhaps instead it has been Hayes’ approach to getting the best out of her record signing. Given that Kerr and Kirby scored 37 goals between them last year, the idea that Chelsea are setting free a player who previously scored 26 in one season in the Frauen Bundesliga is terrifying. New Manchester United manager Marc Skinner has put his own stamp on Casey Stoney’s former side by playing Ella Toone as a false 9. Toone was United’s best attacking player last season and Skinner clearly sees the value of building a team around her. He himself described her as a “nine and a half”, saying she has “this ability so she can get into gaps that are a nine’s gaps or a ten’s gaps”. So far, in an attacking sense, it seems to be suiting United well. Despite concerns that they might struggle with their exodus of players over the summer, they come out on top for both xG (4.15) and overall shots attempted in the league (47), while Toone’s positioning also seems to be getting the best out of the players around her. Three Manchester United players feature in the top 10 players with the highest xG so far this season, more than any other side, and none of them are Toone, despite her central role. With Alessia Russo returning to full fitness and Martha Thomas embedding herself within the team, Skinner does have the option of a more traditional centre-forward, but for now it seems that Toone has got the position all sewn up. Everton were touted by many as having the potential to challenge for the top three this season after a summer packed with exciting signings. Yet things have not quite gone to plan as they recorded back-to-back 4-0 losses against Chelsea and Manchester City in their opening two games. Part of Everton’s problem has been their inability to keep possession in their defensive third. Everton have suffered 32 high turnovers in their opening two fixtures – eight more than any other side, with nine of those ending in shots. Against Manchester City, two of those high turnovers led to goals, whilst Chelsea’s seven shot-ending high turnovers is one of the most by a side in a Women’s Super League match since 2017-18, with only three efforts by a team against an opponent being higher. Whilst Everton’s losses to Chelsea and Manchester City have not really been any worse on paper than last season, the way they have so easily ceded possession – which in Megan Finnigan’s case was literally passing the ball to Sam Kerr to score into an empty net – has left Willie Kirk with plenty cause for concern. When Manchester City imagined what the end of their long unbeaten home record would look like, it certainly was not this. A freak own goal that resulted from a Rosella Ayane slam-dunk style handball saw City lose 2-1 to Tottenham at the City Academy Stadium, and with it fell numerous records. It ended their 62-game unbeaten streak to a side outside of the top three, as well as bringing to a close their record 33-game unbeaten home run, which had stretched back to April 2018. It has also imperilled City’s attempts at ending their run of four consecutive second-placed finishes. Chelsea are the only side to have lost to a team outside of the top three and gone on to win the title since the revamped winter WSL in 2017-18, but luckily for them, that loss to Brighton did not stop them from retaining the league, mostly due to it being the only game they lost all season. If Manchester City wish to repeat that feat, they will likely have to go close to unbeaten for the rest of the season – a tough task.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2021/09/the-wsl-after-matchday-two/,Jesse Parker Humphreys,21/09/2021 4:13,the-analyst
11915,All to Play For: WSL 2021-22 Preview,"The Women’s Super League kicks off this Friday with more eyes on it than ever before. Thanks to an unprecedented television deal in the United Kingdom with Sky, never will a season have had more focus on it.  Reigning champions Chelsea will be looking to secure an historic third consecutive title win, with Arsenal and Manchester City most likely to stand in their way. No other side has broken into that top three since 2014, but can someone new upset the party at the top of the table? The WSL title has only ever been won by three teams in back-to-back campaigns: Arsenal in 2011 & 2012, Liverpool in 2013 & 2014, and Chelsea in 2019-20 & 2020-21. No side has ever managed to win it three times in a row and given how tight it is at the top – the league has never been won by a margin of greater than eight points, it would be a remarkable feat from the Blues to do so.  But the WSL is less about the dominance of one team and more about the entrenchment of three. Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City may swap around but not since 2014 has any side been able to nick a top three spot off them, and Manchester City were not even in the league that year. This is mainly because all three of them have proved very hard to beat.  Manchester City: 1206 days – Liverpool (A) on May 18, 2018Arsenal: 291 days – Manchester United (A) on November 8, 2020Chelsea: 200 days – Brighton & Hove Albion on February 7, 2021 Looking at the table from 2020-21, Manchester United came close last season with a gap of just a point between themselves and Arsenal in third. In a mini-league including just games between those four teams, Manchester United won more points (5) than Arsenal (4) – so if there is a chance of breaking the hegemony of the “big three” then this could be it. However, United’s expected goal difference was 20.3, far behind that of Arsenal (34.7), Manchester City (43.7) and Chelsea (41.9). The drop off below Manchester United was even starker; Everton’s in fifth was only 1.4. There are two teams in the WSL who look to have the potential to break into the top three: Everton and Manchester United. Despite United coming close last season, they have since lost manager Casey Stoney as well as their American World Cup winners, Christen Press and Tobin Heath. Everton’s bright start to last season faded fast but they have recruited significantly this summer, strengthening their squad. However, to have any chance of reaching the Champions League places, they will have to improve significantly against Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal. Everton are very good at taking chances when they are presented to them. They converted 13.8% of open play shots – the best outside of the big three, and their big chance conversion rate of 64% was higher than any other team in the league. The problem is that they create nowhere near enough of those opportunities, particularly against the top teams. Across six games against Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal in 2020-21, they only managed an expected goals (xG) total of 2.46. But even more problematic is their lack of defensive prowess against these sides, conceding an average of 3.5 goals per game and allowing the opposition an xG of nearly six times what they managed themselves. They will need to tighten up at the back to have even a fighting chance of reaching the top three. Meanwhile, if Manchester United are going to improve on last season’s performance, they might not need to look across the Atlantic for their answer. 21-year-old Ella Toone was one of the most productive attacking players in the league last season.  Across the entire WSL last season, only Vivianne Miedema (144) and Sam Kerr (143) were involved in more attacking sequences than Toone (141), either attempting the shot, creating the chance or being involved in the build up to the shot. Toone’s tally was by far the highest at Man Utd, with the next best being Leah Galton on 78, nearly half the tally of the 21-year-old creative star. Toone created 35 chances from open play in WSL 2020-21 – a tally that only three players bettered, while her non-penalty expected goals total of 6.48 put her in the top ten players in the league. No United player had better opportunities in front of goal than her and none of the players above her in the ranking across the entire league was as young as she is. With new manager Marc Skinner coming in, the way United might look to play may change. But getting the ball to Toone will be key if the side are going to compete for the Champions League spots once again. Last season saw a contest for the Golden Boot that was almost as fascinating as the title race, as Sam Kerr pipped Vivianne Miedema to the Golden Boot in the final week of the season. Miedema had more goals than the Australian throughout the whole campaign, until Kerr’s brace against Spurs on May 5 took her past the Dutch hotshot. Kerr became the first player to win a Golden Boot across three different continents as she added the WSL top scorer accolade to her others collected from the NWSL in America and the W-League in Australia. Miedema – who was looking to win her third consecutive Golden Boot, scored 10 goals in her first five appearances of the season, but with just eight in her following 17 WSL games, she had to settle for second place in 2020-21. 2020-21 was Miedema’s worst WSL season since her first (2017-18) in terms of goals per 90 (0.87) and non-penalty xG per 90 (0.74), while her shot conversion rate dropped to 17% from 28.6% in 2019-20. However, it’s worth mentioning that Miedema’s “worst” can still outdo quite most player’s efforts – that npxG of 0.74 last season was still the second highest in the WSL behind only Sam Kerr (1.03). They now look set to reignite their competition but there is also a new kid on the block: Khadija “Bunny” Shaw. Shaw joined Manchester City during the summer, having scored 22 goals in 20 games for Bordeaux in the Division 1 Feminine in France last season. Not since Nikita Parris left have Manchester City had a standout scorer in their team, but with Shaw in situ it looks like Miedema and Kerr’s rivalry will become a triumvirate. It’s yet to be seen if Shaw will partner Ellen White in attack or simply be a direct replacement, with White looking really reaching the heights of his performances on the international stage in the WSL in recent seasons. The 32-year-old might currently be the second-leading scorer in the history of the competition with 57 goals, but her two league campaigns at Man City have produced just 16 goals from 34 appearances – only the fifth-most in this period and less than half of Miedema’s total (34 goals). At the bottom of the table, the focus will be on Carla Ward and her move to Aston Villa. The highly rated coach kept rivals Birmingham City up last season in extraordinary circumstances, having only had eight players available to her when she arrived. Ward’s focus at Birmingham was organisation, with her side making only two errors leading to goals the entire season. Contrast that with Aston Villa who’s six errors was the most in the league. At Birmingham, Ward was happy to let the opposition have the ball. Birmingham’s PPDA (Passes Per Defensive Action) of 15.7 was the lowest in the league, but more will be expected of her at Villa. Despite a disappointing first season in the WSL, they have invested significantly in their team over the past couple of years. Under Gemma Davies, Aston Villa sacrificed defensive solidity in favour of more attacking football, averaging an expected goals of 0.85 per game. Her successor Marcus Bignot utilised a dour style in order to keep them up, averaging only half that at 0.43 a match. Villa will be hoping that Ward can marry the attacking vigour of Davies with her own organisational capabilities.  West Ham’s inaugural WSL season in 2018-19 saw them finish seventh, before slipping to eighth a season later in 2019-20. Ahead of 2020-21, there seemed to be a real danger of relegation for the Hammers – especially following a 1-0 defeat to Brighton on November 15 that left them on four points from seven games. Their decision to part ways with Matt Beard following that defeat and employ Olli Harder saw them shore up a defence that had conceded 20 times in seven matches under Beard in 2020-21. True, results didn’t improve – only eight points and one win were secured in 13 matches under Harder, but they did become tighter at the back by switching to a back three. The Hammers conceded 16 times in those 13 games and kept four clean sheets in their last six matches of the season. Their solitary victory under Harder was impressive, as the 5-0 win against Reading in April demonstrated their potential going forward. The top-level numbers looked encouraging for the Hammers under Harder but looking deeper it seems that this defensive improvement may well have been a stroke of luck. They allowed their opposition an average of 1.71 xG per game under their new coach – the third-worst average in the league behind only Birmingham City (1.80) and Bristol City (1.83). Grace Fisk will be central to West Ham’s plans if they are to arrest their gradual decline. The 23-year-old central defender made her debut at the start of last year and has improved considerably in that time. Fisk played more minutes than any other defender in the WSL last year (1980) and stands out in duels with the second-best duel win ratio (68.9%) and seventh-best aerial duel win ratio (68.2%) of defenders to play at least 1000 minutes in 2020-21. She looks to have a bright future ahead of her.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2021/09/wsl-2021-22-preview/,Jesse Parker Humphreys,01/09/2021 12:25,the-analyst
