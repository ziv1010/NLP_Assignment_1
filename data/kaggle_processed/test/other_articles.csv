10637,Inter Milan vs AC Milan: Prediction and Preview,"The first Milan derby of the 2023-24 season takes place with the Serie A rivals clear at the top of the table with the league’s only two remaining 100% records. Here, we preview the Derby della Madonnina.  Inter have dominated the Derby della Madonnina in recent times. Since the start of 2020-21, the two sides have met 12 times in all competitions, with Inter winning seven of those matches to Milan’s three. With Juventus’ dominance over Italian football waning in the last few years, the Milan derby has once again taken on a deeper meaning than a mere cross-city rivalry. Both Inter and Milan have come to be consistent title contenders in Serie A, and Milan derbies since the Covid-impacted 2019-20 season mean just that little bit more now, and this has been reflected in the intensity of recent exchanges. As if the battle for the Scudetto wasn’t enough, Milan coach Stefano Pioli recently even made reference to the fact his side and Inter are looking to win a “second star” this season for 20 Serie A titles, with both sides currently on 19. Inter have had Milan’s number recently, though, and this could be the first time ever that the Nerazzurri win five straight competitive matches against their co-tenants at the San Siro. The two sides met in last season’s Champions League semi-final, and those two legs essentially acted as a precursor to the respective tactical directions we have seen them go in this season. Back in May, Inter’s ruthlessness in transition and from dead-ball situations helped them reach the final against Manchester City. In the absence of André Onana and Marcelo Brozovic, Simone Inzaghi has leaned into that. That’s come at the expense of press resistance with Hakan Çalhanoglu now deployed at the base of midfield. Meanwhile, after a change in formation between the two legs in May and despite Sandro Tonali’s off-season departure for Newcastle United, the Rossoneri have looked to further refine their possession game. The question with Saturday’s derby, as ever, is which team will dominate possession? In recent meetings between the two, that team has been Milan and the deepening tactical shifts between them over the off-season is enough to suggest that will continue. Pioli’s side have doubled down on their possession game, following the recent trend of inverting full-backs. In this early stage of the season, it has predominantly come in the form of Davide Calabria moving into central positions from right-back, and in some instances, such as against Roma last time out, Rade Krunic moving between the centre-backs and one of Tijjani Reijnders and Ruben Loftus-Cheek retreating deeper. It should serve as no surprise, then, that among the 31 teams in Europe’s top five leagues to have averaged more than 400 completed passes per game, Milan have the third-lowest percentage of progressive passes at 4.9%. The sample sizes are small of course, but it is notable that with a similar in-possession game, Manchester City are second-lowest at 4.8% while Las Palmas are the lowest at 4.7%. Yet the difference between Milan and teams like Man City or Arsenal is that the latter two are pinning opposition defences inside their own half. Among those 31 teams so far, Milan have the lowest percentage of passes that end in the attacking third at 16.9%. That’s a stark difference to a team like Arsenal, who have the highest at 35.3%. That ultimately translates to low shot volume and quality, with Milan averaging the sixth-lowest shot tally in the penalty area (8.33) and non-penalty xG (1.08) per game among that sample of 31 teams in Europe’s top five leagues. While Reijnders and Loftus-Cheek have adapted well to Serie A, what effectively becomes a double-pivot of Krunic and Calabria feels like the most pragmatic possible composition. Even so, it feels at times like Milan get stuck in quicksand in the middle third, as highlighted by Krunic completing 66 passes in open play against Roma at 96% accuracy – with only Fikayo Tomori (80) managing more – but just three into the attacking third. That becomes a problem against Inter, who as an extension of their late-season form last season, have been dynamic in transition to start this term, particularly in their last fixture against Fiorentina. Lautaro Martínez has had to assume greater responsibility in between the boxes, with Marcus Thuram’s arrival and Hakan Çalhanoglu’s permanent shift to the base of midfield in Simone Inzaghi’s 3-5-2. Martínez has been critical so far, averaging more touches (44.3) and progressive passes received (8.6) per 90 to start this term than in any of his previous five seasons with the Nerazzurri. It is not affecting his ability to arrive in the penalty area, though, with his 16 shots only fewer than Napoli’s Victor Osimhen (18) in Serie A so far. In addition, among players to have taken five or more shots in Serie A this season, Martínez (0.18) is joint-fourth for non-penalty xG per shot, just behind Thuram (0.21). Inter’s 4-0 win over Fiorentina before the international break was emblematic of this emphasis in generating shots after immediately regaining possession. Thuram’s opener in the 23rd minute came from a high turnover, before Inter went from one end to the other for Martínez to double the margin and break the game open early in the second half. With an ageing Edin Dzeko and an out-of-sorts Romelu Lukaku up front last season alongside Martínez, that ability to truly penetrate in transition was arguably something they lacked. In Serie A this season, only Napoli (10) have generated more shots from high turnovers than Inter (8), and that’s before even considering shots from transitions deeper on the pitch. As noted already, Inter could make it five consecutive wins against Milan in all competitions for the first time in their history, while they have scored in their last 11 “home” matches against Milan in all competitions. They’ve never scored in 12 consecutive derbies, also achieving 11 straight between April 1993 and January 2000. Milan have won their past two away fixtures in the league against Inter, meanwhile, and there is some ominous reading for Inter fans– the last time they faced Milan while on equal points was the infamous 6-0 drubbing in May 2001, which remains the biggest margin of defeat in the fixture’s history. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability to score over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked in the world and 100 is the best. Ahead of Saturday’s derby, here are the rankings for Inter and Milan. The Opta supercomputer favours Inter to continue their unbeaten start to the Serie A season, giving them a 46.2% chance of victory in comparison to Milan’s 26.2%. The draw comes in at just 20%. Inter have won the first three matches of this season without conceding a goal. A win here would see them achieve four victories in the first four Serie A matches for the eighth time and first time since 2019-20, and they could do it with four clean sheets for the first time in their history in the competition.

5095,Watch: Konate chokes on confetti as Liverpool celebrate Carabao Cup win - and Robertson found it hilarious ,"Liverpool had plenty to smile about after overcoming Chelsea in a Carabao Cup final penalty shootout, with Andy Robertson taking great delight in seeing Ibrahima Konate choke on celebratory confetti. Ticker tape rained down on the Reds after they prevailed in an epic encounter with their Premier League rivals at Wembley Stadium which required 22 spot-kicks in order to determine a winner. Caoimhin Kelleher converted the decisive effort from 12 yards, as fellow goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga fired high over the crossbar, and Jurgen Klopp’s side were able to get their hands on more major silverware. Konate choking on confetti and Robbo finding it hilarious has done me in… 🤣 pic.twitter.com/oiHSfu7cuu Liverpool’s triumph at the home of English football means that they remain on course for an unprecedented quadruple this season. Klopp’s men are back in the Premier League title race, as they sit six points adrift of Manchester City with a game in hand, and are also into the fifth round of the FA Cup and last 16 of the Champions League. Konate will be hoping to figure prominently in all of those trophy quests as he seeks to add to a medal collection on Merseyside. The French centre-half has taken in 15 appearances across all competitions this season, although only seven of those have been Premier League starts as he competes with the likes of Joel Matip and Joe Gomez for the right to partner Virgil van Dijk at the heart of Liverpool’s defence. Klopp’s men will be back in action on Wednesday when they play host to Norwich in the FA Cup, before then welcoming top-four hopefuls West Ham to Anfield on Saturday.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/watch-konate-chokes-confetti-liverpool-carabao-cup-win-robertson-/blt7b169b3034856e1d,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3153,Chokers or champions? Man City have plenty of bottle despite history of heartbreak,"Tottenham feel like an obvious inspiration for Manchester City to turn to right now. Pep Guardiola's side can go three points clear on Sunday afternoon thanks to Antonio Conte's side, who claimed a 1-1 draw at Anfield on Saturday evening that left Liverpool wondering if their Premier League title hopes are now over. Perhaps it should have come as no surprise, given Spurs have shown their fearlessness by doing more damage than anyone to City's title hopes, taking six points off them this season. But Pep Guardiola can also look back three years to a game against Tottenham that proved crucial to holding off a previous title charge from the Reds. In late-April 2019, Jurgen Klopp's side were similarly breathing down City's necks in an epic title race, just a point behind and boasting the same intimidating demeanour. Needing a perfect run to secure a title defence, City's momentum was severely disrupted by a cruel Champions League defeat to Tottenham on away goals rule. Similar to the midweek heartbreak at Real Madrid, they were on the verge of a memorable night only for it to be ripped away when an injury-time winner from Raheem Sterling was ruled out by VAR. Just three days later, City had to face Spurs again with the danger of a hangover potentially also ruining their Premier League challenge. The mood in the immediate aftermath was sombre. Training was unusually quiet and low key. The usual banter was missing and Guardiola and his coaches looked on worryingly. Phil Foden at least brought some energy and took it into the game, scoring the winning goal, while all around him City's squad dug into their resources to eke out a crucial 1-0 victory. The final whistle was greeted with a mixture of relief and joy as the title challenge had not been derailed. Guardiola described it as one of the most incredible performances of his time at the Etihad Stadium and it was a platform for them to go on a winning streak until the end of the season that clinched another Premier League trophy. Now, they need exactly the same response. City were minutes away from a second successive Champions League final on Wednesday night before Rodrygo's incredible impact and one of the most remarkable comebacks of all time. For the older members of the squad like Fernandinho, Ilkay Gundogan and Kevin De Bruyne, the defeat will be even more bruising with the clock ticking down on their chances of winning a Champions League trophy. European failure has long been a stick to beat them and Guardiola with, but it now comes along with added accusations that they choke when under pressure. REAL MADRID HAVE COME BACK OUT OF NOWHERE pic.twitter.com/5YsRIq3Slk Champions League exits have been dogged by moments of madness – two goals in two minutes for Madrid followed costly explosive periods in previous defeats to Monaco, Liverpool and Spurs. Guardiola was bullish in dismissing suggestions that his side lack character. ""It’s football,"" he said ahead of Sunday's game. ""What happened, we accept it. We have said many times we had lots of chances. “[Some] people say it was down to a lack of character. A lack of character? What about if Jack Grealish had scored the two goals? What about the character then? “What about when [Angel] Correa shot in the Atletico Madrid match and [Ederson] saved. Now it’s character. If Correa had scored, it’s not character. “When Courtois put his feet here and it's deflected for a corner and away from the goal that is not character for the team."" There's a narrative that City don't have the capability to come back from difficult situations, partly because they are rarely ever in them, with their focus on taking control of most games. But, as an example, of Premier League teams to be losing at half-time this season, no side averages claiming more points than City's 1.33 per match. Then there's matches where they've fought back to win after conceding the first goal - against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League and away to Arsenal in the Premier League. Madrid were the first team to beat City this season after trailing. Even at Anfield, City were losing with 10 minutes to go when De Bruyne lashed in an equaliser for a point that could prove to be crucial. Still, recovering from the depths of Santiago Bernabeu will be difficult and Guardiola insists they must take the scars of that defeat into the clash with Newcastle. ""They don’t have to forget it,"" he said. ""How are we going to forget it? ""We are going to play against Newcastle thinking about that for sure and I know the players the day before in the training sessions and the meeting room, we are going to do it. ""I don’t have any doubt about that because at 89 minutes, we were 1-0 and we were close."" Amid accusations that when the going gets tough, City go missing, Sunday is the perfect opportunity to prove the doubters wrong and take one giant step towards retaining their title.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chokers-champions-man-city-history-heartbreak/bltc819d372888c2df9,Jonathan Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
329,Vela sends Bale LAFC warning: 'He will have to come to work',"Gareth Bale will ""have to come to work"" if he wants to make a success of his new start in MLS, warns Los Angeles FC forward Carlos Vela, as his new team-mate prepares for life in California. The former Real Madrid attacker turned down a stay in Europe to move stateside as a free agent, joining former Italy skipper Giorgio Chiellini as a major signing for Steve Cherundolo's club, weeks after guiding Wales to the 2022 World Cup. But Vela, one of LAFC's star performers this term, says the veteran attacker cannot expect an easy ride, and must be prepared to put the hard work in to earn his place when he starts training. ""If he comes in with a good mentality, with a good attitude, he will be really important because he’s a big player,"" Vela told a press conference when asked about what impact Bale can bring. ""He’s coming from Real Madrid, so I think I don’t have to talk much about him because everybody knows how good he is. The only thing I can say is he will have to come to work because it’s not that easy, like how the people think. ""If he comes in a good shape, in a good way, he come with a good attitude, with good mentality, he will be so important for us. And I hope we can bring that [high] level to the team to win a trophy."" After a slew of successful silverware pursuits with Madrid, it is likely the forward will have his eyes on more trophies after linking up with LAFC, who are among the frontrunners to go all the way to the MLS Cup at the end of the campaign. But if anything, the most important thing for the attacker will be ensuring he is match-fit and ready for Qatar at the end of the season, as Wales prepare for a first World Cup campaign since 1958. As one of the game's greatest modern stars to never feature at the tournament, Bale will be mindful of his health while ramping up his playing time after a season primarily spent on the bench at the Santiago Bernabeu.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/vela-sends-bale-lafc-warning-wales-star-transfer-mls/blt3079e27cbbfe9775,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8115,Ex-Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho hit with â¬1.5m fine by Spanish authorities,"Not only is Jose Mourinho unemployed, but he is also facing money problems. The Portuguese manager, recently of Roma, has been hit with a hefty fine by the Spanish tax authorities, although he presumably has enough saved away to take the hit.  Mourinho had an open case which he had appealed for tax evasion from the period of 2010-12 when he was employed by Real Madrid. His appeal has been turned down by the Supreme Court, as per Relevo, and he will be forced to pay a â¬571k fine, in addition to a settlement of â¬881k, amounting to over â¬1.45m in total. While he escaped charges for the year of 2010, the tax authorities did find that he did not pay the correct amount of tax for the years of 2011 and 2012. He alleged that Real Madrid were paying the agency fees to Jorge Mendesâ Gestifute out of his wages, rather than him. That has not been upheld though, and Mourinho becomes the latest high-profile figure in Spain to fall foul of the taxman.

6057,'Penalised for having a big nose!' - UEFA president Ceferin not happy with offside rule,"UEFA president Aleksandr Ceferin says he is not happy with the current offside and handball rules. The introduction of VAR into football has proved controversial, as many critics say reviews take too long and scrutinise incidents down to millimetres. The head of European football's governing body is the latest to question the offside rule, as he believes some players can be unfairly punished. ""At the start, VAR was too slow. Now, in European competition, it’s a lot quicker,"" Ceferin said to L'Equipe. ""The fact that there can be an offside by five millimetres is still an issue for me. You are penalised if you have a big nose or big feet. Ceferin also has some questions about the current handball rule and says he has discussed the issue with ex-Real Madrid and Portugal star Figo.  ""I have a problem with handballs. Nobody understands anything anymore. It should be clarified,"" he added. ""Figo told me the other day that if he was playing these days, if he didn’t know what to do with the ball, he would shoot at the defender’s hands.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/big-nose-uefa-president-ceferin-offside-rule/blt266676295e79200d,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

2320,'Any team would miss Sadio' - Henderson admits regret at Liverpool losing 'one of the best in the world' Mane,"Jordan Henderson accepts Liverpool will miss the services of Sadio Mane, who left Merseyside for Bayern Munich earlier in the summer.  The Senegalese forward joined the reigning Bundesliga champions in a deal worth €32m (£27m/$34m), with a further €6m (£5m/$6m) possible based on appearances, along with another €3m depending on individual and team achievements. He spent six seasons with the Reds and helped them win the Champions League in 2019 followed by the Premier League the next season.  Liverpool have reaped huge dividends from their clinical front three of Mane, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino over the course of the last few seasons.  Speaking to talkSPORT, Henderson accepted the loss of Mane is a huge void and the team misses the 30-year-old.  ""I think any team in the world would miss Sadio,"" he said. ""For me, he’s one of the best players in the world and one of the best characters around the dressing room and around the place. “He’s a great lad, always smiling and joking around and just really good to have around. Setting standards as well. Big miss for us, but that’s football. Life goes on. I wish him all the best and hope he does well at Bayern."" Liverpool have signed Uruguayan hitman Darwin Nunez in the summer to reinforce their attacking department. They paid Benfica £64 million ($79m) upfront to sign Nunez, and could pay up to another £21m ($26m) in add-ons.  The 23-year-old has got off to a brilliant start in his new surroundings as he scored in his first competitive debut against Manchester City in the Community Shield. Henderson is impressed with the youngster and feels that he can contribute with goals in the Premier League.  He said: ""I’ve been really impressed with him. He’s still a very young boy, but I’m seeing a lot of positive things, a lot of good things. “I think he will give us something different as well up front. There’s a lot of potential there and he’s settled in, so hopefully, he can start the season off in the Premier League really well.""

3520,"Saved by the next generation! Liverpool winners, losers and ratings as Carvalho and Elliott thrill vs Newcastle","The Kop has a new darling after Eddie Howe and his time-wasting Newcastle side were stunned at Anfield. Substitute Fabio Carvalho - just 20 years old - slammed in a stoppage time goal to make it two wins from two for Jurgen Klopp's side. And teenage midfielder Harvey Elliott, brilliant in his own right, was there to celebrate with him. How the home fans celebrated this. Klopp busted out his trademark fist pumps in front of the Kop, and no wonder. It may only be August, but this felt huge, as much for the mood as anything else. Liverpool trailed to a first-half strike from Alexander Isak, the Newcastle debutant, but roused themselves belatedly after the break, equalising through Roberto Firmino. With Anfield infuriated by what they perceived as constant time-wasting tactics from the visitors, the Reds looked to have missed their chance of all three points when the clock ticked into the 98th minute. But as Newcastle failed to deal with a James Milner corner, it was Carvalho who somehow forced the ball home from close range, sparking wild scenes in the stands, in the dugouts and on the pitch.  Whatever the 20-year-old, who celebrated his birthday yesterday, goes on to achieve at this famous old club, he'll do well to top this feeling for sheer elation.",https://www.goal.com/en/lists/liverpool-winners-losers-and-ratings-as-carvalho-and-elliott/blt017e914752974db3,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7461,Arsenal star Aubameyang may not play in Afcon after being left out of Gabon squad due to suspected heart problem,"Arsenal star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was left out of Gabon's squad to face Ghana on Friday as he continues to recover from coronavirus, with sources in the country's FA telling GOAL that he may not play in the tournament because of the issue. Scans were done by the Confederation of African Football (CAF), with two other Gabon stars, Axel Meye and Mario Lemina, also removed from the squad for the same reason. Aubameyang tested positive for Covid-19 in the run-up to the Africa Cup of Nations but had recently returned to training ahead of Friday night's game. Medical tests conducted by Gabon continue to reveal traces of coronavirus in the player’s system, sources within the camp have told GOAL. The Arsenal striker has missed the Panthers’ opening two matches at the tournament after testing positive for Covid-19 upon his arrival at Yaounde airport on January 6. ""According to the CAF medical commission, the players Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Axel Meye and Mario Lemina, who just returned from Covid, cannot take part in this match,"" the Gabon Football Federation said in a statement.  ""The examinations showed cardiac lesions. CAF did not want to take any risks."" However, the cardiac tests which Aubameyang underwent - mandatory for all Afcon players who return to action following a coronavirus diagnosis - revealed traces of Covid still in Aubameyang’s system, and not the ""cardiac lesions’"" that were announced on Friday. Will Aubameyang feature in Afcon? After the Ghana match, head coach Patrice Neveu - who himself has only recently recovered from coronavirus - said Aubameyang would be subjected to further tests. “For the moment, nothing has changed,” a source within the Gabon camp then clarified to GOAL on Sunday. “They will do another test on him tomorrow.” Gabon had been hesitant to follow doctors’ advice and prevent the striker from playing aainst Ghana at Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo, with Aubameyang himself initially refusing to accept the advice of doctors. The Arsenal man was eventually talked around by his father, and it’s understood that Gabon are unwilling to risk the striker until he successfully passes the cardiac tests that produced problematic results ahead of the Ghana showdown. Aubameyang was hoping to start a match for the first time since December 2, with the striker excluded from the Arsenal squad since being left out for breaking team rules. The Gabon star also recently battled Covid-19, which saw him miss the team's Afcon opener against Comoros. Gabon went on to win that match 1-0 thanks to a goal from Aaron Boupendza, before earning a late 1-1 draw with Ghana on Friday night after Aubameyang was blocked from playing by CAF.

2781,Caf Champions League final: Morocco venue choice explained after Mosimane and Al Ahly protests,"Caf head of operations and media relations, Luxolo September, has explained why Morocco was chosen to host the Champions League final. This comes after Al Ahly, and their South African head coach, Pitso Mosimane, raised concerns following the choice of the venue for the final. When the Caf Champions League group stages games were finished,rumours were saying SA is hosting.Hao,jikijiki,after semifinals game were decided,there was a loud silence on the country to host  the final.Then after the first leg of the semi finals, suddenly Morocco is hosting.🤔 The football governing body has designated the Mohammed V Stadium as the venue that will host this season’s ultimate clash. ""Back in January, we spoke to all African countries, only Morocco and Senegal requested to host the final,"" September told Al-Hayah TV channel, as quoted by KingFut. ""Senegal then withdrew, leaving only Morocco as potential hosts, so the decision was simple. ""Every country could have applied, but they didn’t. The date we chose the final venue was announced months ago."" The official was categorical that the decision cannot be reversed and that Mosimane’s club has to respect the choice. ""Al Ahly is a big club, but the decision is already made and everybody has to respect it. We are all professionals, after all,"" he added.

10293,The Story of a Crazy 2023 Brasileirão Season,"Brasileirão 2023 proved to be one of the craziest league seasons in recent memory… and the beginning of Endrick’s rise to superstardom. The 2023 Brasileirão witnessed a season for the ages. At the centre of it were an underdog, Botafogo. After securing the best opening half of the Brasileirão in history, they surged to the top of the league and were projected to win the title in 94.3% of the Opta supercomputer simulations after their 1-1 draw with Athletico Paranaense on 22 October. Then came the almighty fall. We look back at the exceptionally dramatic title battle in Brazil, one in which Palmeiras eventually prevailed, but only after Botafogo suffered an unimaginable collapse. Botafogo began the season by wildly overdelivering on pre-season expectations. The team, owned by American businessman John Textor, had suffered early exits in their state championship, as well as in the Copa do Brasil. The aim for the Brasileirão was, at best, to qualify for the next year’s Libertadores, which would mean a top-six finish in the league. The expectations had to be reset following an unbelievable first half of the Brasileirão. Amassing 47 points from a possible 57, they secured the best first half to a Brasileirão season ever witnessed in the current format of the competition. The highlight was the away game versus pre-season league favourites and closest rivals in the table, Palmeiras, in the 12th round of fixtures. A 1-0 win thanks to a Tiquinho Soares’ first-half goal sent them seven points clear at the top, ahead of Grêmio. By the conclusion of the 19th round of fixtures, Botafogo were 13 points ahead of any other side in the league table – the biggest points advantage at the halfway point in the league era of the Brasileirão. The underlying numbers suggested that they were overachieving, both in defence and attack, however. Their 35 goals had been accumulated from a total of 27.4 expected goals (xG), the biggest overperformance (+7.6) at that stage. Defensively, they’d conceded just 11 goals from shots totalling 25 xG – a monumental overperformance of 14, which again was the highest in the competition. A regression to somewhere closer to the average was expected for Botafogo for the second half of the tournament, but what happened was far beyond that. After the draw against Athletico Paranaense on 22 October, the title looked inevitable. Botafogo would surely win the league – the Opta supercomputer had them as overwhelming favourites (94.3%) with just 11 games remaining and they held a seven-point lead over RB Bragantino. What everyone didn’t realise at the time was that this would signal the start of a disastrous 11-game run without a win to complete the season, winning just six points (W0 D6 L5) – the lowest tally in the league. The tide could have turned in their favour with eight games remaining. They had a penalty in the 83rd minute to extend their lead over title-rivals Palmeiras to 4-1. It was saved and they went on to lose the game 4-3. There was another 4-3 comeback defeat two games later, when they led Grêmio with 40 minutes remaining. They then conceded three 90th-minute equalisers in the space of four games across 16 days to end November – the last of those seeing them take the lead in the 99th minute of the match and still surrendering the win. In that space of 11 games that saw Botafogo win just six points, Palmeiras – the pre-season favourites for the title – would show their strength. They won a league-high 26 points, with their brilliant finish seeing them pip their rivals to the post at the very last. Across the highs and lows of an unpredictable season, there was one team who always remained close to the top. Palmeiras would only fall outside of the top four positions in three rounds (14th, 15th and 27th) between the opening matchday and the 33rd round of fixtures. At the time of their home defeat vs Atlético Mineiro on MD 27 – which followed their semi-final elimination in the Libertadores – they fell out of the top four for the last time and found themselves 14 points behind Botafogo at the top. Their supporters had almost overwhelmingly accepted that a second consecutive title wouldn’t materialise. Wins against Coritiba (2-0 away) and Bahia (1-0 at home) fell either side of a brilliant win over rivals São Paulo. Their 5-0 victory in the Choque-Rei game was their joint-biggest, equalling their win in 1965. Those three wins took them into their all-important clash at Botafogo with confidence. Prior to kick-off, they still trailed league leaders Botafogo by six points, having played a game more than them. Down 3-0 inside 36 minutes of their clash, their faint title hopes once again looked dashed. Botafogo had been rampant – their 15 shots in the opening 45 minutes were the most that Palmeiras had ever faced in the first half of a competitive game under Abel Ferreira, with none of those games seeing more than the seven shots on target fired in by the league leaders in the first half. But Palmeiras had Endrick. Four minutes into the second half, the 17-year-old wonderkid scored his first goal of the game, then, with 76 minutes down, Botafogo’s Adryelson received a red card to set up a tense finish for the home side. When they were awarded a penalty with seven minutes of normal time remaining, it looked all over. Palmeiras goalkeeper Weverton hadn’t saved any of the previous 24 penalties that he’d faced outside of shootouts – the two that hadn’t been scored in that run had hit the woodwork. So, of course, Weverton saved Tiquinho’s penalty. Exactly one minute later, Endrick scored his second goal of the game, before José López equalised with 70 seconds of normal time remaining. A 3-3 draw felt like a disaster for Botafogo after they’d led by three goals at half-time, but it would get even worse. With the last kick of the game on 98 minutes and 46 seconds, Raphael Veiga’s free-kick found the right foot of Murilo to complete the impossible comeback and take Palmeiras within three points of Botafogo. Despite a 3-0 loss to fellow title hopefuls Flamengo on 9 November, Palmeiras ended the season in great form to seal an unlikely title win at the expense of Botafogo. Their 1-1 draw on the final day at Cruzeiro sealed a 12th Brasileiro Série A title and their second in a row – slightly more dramatic than their previous, which they won by eight points over Internacional. Endrick ended the season with 11 goals across 1,558 minutes of action in 2023 Brasileirão, with his minutes-per-goal ratio of 142 better than any of the other 42 players to score more than five times. Six of his goals came in his final eight appearances, when Palmeiras needed him the most. He became the first player to score at least 10 goals in a Brasileirão season while aged under 18 since Neymar in 2009. Not bad company to keep. They ended the tournament with the best home record (44 points), the most goals scored overall (64), and the longest period of time in a winning game state (40%). Supporters also celebrated the relegation of their state rival Santos to the second division for the first time in history. The team where Pelé scored more than a thousand of his goals had their worst moment in the history of the Brasileirão in the first edition played following the death of the king of Brazilian football. Santos had begun 2023 already preoccupying their supporters by fighting against relegation in the state championship for the third consecutive year. Their local battle was well succeeded, but they didn’t have the same luck in the national league, nicknamed Brasileirão Rei in homage to Pelé. Although starting out with a reasonable campaign in the first six matches (W3 D1 L2), Santos won only two of their next 17 games (W2 D5 L10). There was even a point when they had conceded a goal in 21 consecutive games, their longest such run in the history of the tournament. The negative numbers reached their peak in a 7-1 defeat against Internacional, their worst in a Brasileirão game, equalling the 7-1 defeat against Corinthians in 2005. However, the awful defeat on 22 October looked like changing things for the better for Santos in the tournament – they followed that emphatic defeat with a seven-game unbeaten run (W3 D4) and gave themselves a fighting chance of avoiding relegation. Their hopes rested on 13-goal Marcos Leonardo, as he matched his most prolific year in the Brasileirão, set in 2022. With 35 goals across Brasileirão history, only Yuri Alberto (two years older) has scored more often than him among players born in the 21st century. But in the end, their overreliance on his goals was their undoing. He failed to score in his final eight league appearances for Santos, with his teammates only managing to find the net four times in those games. That, aligned with their defensive frailties, saw them suffer a historic relegation on the final day with a 2-1 defeat at home to Fortaleza, while relegation rivals Bahia and Vasco both picked up much-needed wins. The battle between Botafogo and Palmeiras and the relegation of Brazilian giants Santos weren’t the only noteworthy stories from the Brasileirão in 2023. Red Bull Bragantino may have eventually finished eight points off the top of the table, but they had their best performance in a season since their promotion in 2020. The team maintained their identity, with the lowest starting XI average age (25 years and 30 days), and by being one of the five teams that didn’t change their manager across the tournament, alongside Fluminense, Fortaleza, Palmeiras and Grêmio. If the strength of RB Bragantino was built on the consistency of their coach, that was the weakness that stopped Flamengo from having a clearer shot at the title. Since the departure of Jorge Jesus in 2020, Mengão haven’t been able to find a manager that consolidates his work. They initiated 2023 with Vítor Pereira, who gave way to Jorge Sampaoli after a 4-1 defeat against Fluminense in the final of the Campeonato Carioca. Sampaoli also said goodbye after losing a final, this time at the Copa do Brasil against São Paulo. The man that Flamengo chose to finish 2023 and already plan for the next year was former Brazil coach Tite. The most memorable moment under Tite was the 3-0 win against Palmeiras that put Flamengo back in the fight for the title. They shut down the soon-to-be champions allowing them only one shot on target, the fewest Palmeiras had during the title campaign, alongside a 0-0 away against Santos. Besides Tite, another former Brazilian national team coach did a good job this season in the Brasileirão. Luiz Felipe Scolari returned to a coaching position only six months after announcing his retirement, accepting the position at Atlético Mineiro after Eduardo Coudet said his goodbyes. Atlético struggled in the first few matches with their new coach in charge – their first win came 10 games in, across all competitions. The winless period caused the elimination of Galo from the Libertadores for the third consecutive year against Palmeiras. However, the experienced coach found the path for yet another comeback in his career. His side amassed 39 points in the second half of the season, the most of any team, largely because of Paulinho and Hulk. Although a league-low 12 players scored in the tournament for Atlético Mineiro, they were the only side to have two players with 10+ goals. Paulinho finished the tournament as the top goal scorer with 20 goals, while he also had the highest expected goals (xG) tally of the tournament (15.1). The forward overachieved his numbers by having an excellent accuracy – among players with more than 50 shots, he was the only one to hit the target on more than half of those (53.3%). Hulk also remained a key player for Atlético Mineiro in his third season at the club, being the league leader for assists across the league season (11) alongside Luis Suárez. He was also the second player with most goals involvements in the tournament (26), only behind the Uruguayan legend. Suárez had his most prolific league season in goals involvement since 2017-18 for Barcelona. Having scored 17 goals and provided 11 assists, the former Liverpool player delivered a typical return in the twilight of his career. The superb numbers of Suárez put Grêmio in the runners-up position at the end of the tournament, higher than anyone was expecting for a team recently promoted from the second division. In fact, Grêmio had the best placing of any newly promoted team in the history of the tournament in the league format (since 2003). They also had the second-highest percentage of points won for a promoted team, winning 59.7% of the total points available (68 of 114), only behind their local rivals Internacional (60.5%) in 2018.

2856,Reigning champions Algeria shockingly eliminated from Afcon after Ivory Coast rout,"Algeria have been eliminated from the Africa Cup of Nations following a 3-1 rout at the hands of the Ivory Coast in Douala, ending the reigning champions' defence at the first hurdle. The incumbent holders, who arrived at the delayed Cameroon 2021 edition having claimed their second tournament title at Egypt 2019, were among the heavy favourites to challenge for the top prize once again. But instead they will face a humiliating early flight home after Riyad Mahrez and the rest of the Fennec Foxes failed to claim a single win in Group E in underwhelming fashion. Having been seeded as the top side in their group and with the third-best FIFA ranking in the tournament behind Senegal and Morocco, Djamel Belmadi's side were expected to make easy work of their path to the knockout stages. Yet a goalless opening draw with Sierra Leone set the tone for an unlikely fall from grace, with Algeria then edged by Equatorial Guinea - one of the lowest-ranked sides in the tournament - thanks to Esteban Obiang's second-half finish in a 1-0 defeat. The result meant that they needed to produce a win in their final group game to have any chance of qualification, either as one of the top-two sides or as one of the four best-ranked third-place finishers - only for the Ivory Coast to ensure that their road to redemption came to a juddering halt. Sofiane Bendebka's finish with a quarter-hour to play at least meant that Algeria did not leave AFCON without a goal to their name, but nevertheless, their poor showing remains one of the most dramatic early exits in recent tournament memory.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/reigning-champions-algeria-shockingly-eliminated-from-afcon/bltd3774d2797d8ffff,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6969,'Man City scouts are not stupid' - Guardiola reveals key question he asks before signing off on transfers,"Pep Guardiola has revealed the one key question he asks before approving transfers at Manchester City. The Spaniard has managed some of the best players ever, from Lionel Messi to Robert Lewandowski, and is currently trying to ensure his new signing Erling Haaland is mentioned in the same breath as those who have come before him.  However, Guardiola insists when it comes to a transfer, his main focus is not on the players' ability, but on how they conduct themselves as a person. Speaking to Sky Sports, Guardiola said of what he looks for in new recruits: ""My favourite player is when they are a good person. ""Don't misunderstand me, they need to be football players they need to have a high ego, but not too high. I love to work with this type of person. That is why one of the things I learnt from ages ago when I went to buy a player first of all, I asked the sporting director of the club 'how are they as a person?' ""I don't care about the skills, really. Because the scouting department, they will show me good players. They are not stupid."" City pulled off one of the coups of the summer window by prising Haaland away from Borussia Dortmund for £51 million ($60m), and Guardiola has also added England international Kalvin Phillips to his midfield ranks. Former Barcelona defender Sergio Gomez has arrived at the Etihad Stadium too, along with back-up goalkeeper Stefan Ortega. It has been suggested that City's summer spending is now finished, but they may be forced to dip back into the market if Bernardo Silva ends up leaving the club amid reported interest from Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-city-scouts-guardiola-reveals-key-question-he-asks/blt67c0a5e4bab65177,Ewan Gennery,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

4856,"Mbappe to Real Madrid, tic, tac, tic tac: PSG superstar's free transfer now inevitable","One should never say never. Particularly in football. Yet Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi did it twice in the same breath last summer. ""I'll be clear: Kylian is going to stay with PSG,"" the club's president told L'Equipe in June 2021. ""We're never going to sell him and he'll never leave for free."" It was startlingly definitive in the circumstances, and counter-productive, too, because even Mbappe was taken aback. The forward freely admits he found it ""scary"".  ""When I heard [him say] that, I swallowed hard,"" he revealed to RMC Sport in October. ""I thought, 'So what's going to happen now?'"" That is what everybody wanted to know; what everybody still wants to know. As Paris Saint-Germain prepare to host Real Madrid in the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday, the football world is still wondering which of those two clubs Mbappe will be representing next season. The smart money, though, is on Madrid. It is no secret that Mbappe wants to play for the 13-time European Cup winners. As a kid, his bedroom wall was adorned with pictures of Cristiano Ronaldo in a Real Madrid jersey. So when he talks about dreaming of wearing that famous, all-white strip, he means it literally. Kylian Mbappe to Real Madrid. It's just meant to be. pic.twitter.com/OrXcREFTWy He would, of course, be at Santiago Bernabeu right now if he had had his way. Mbappe asked to leave PSG last summer. He felt his ""adventure"" at the club was over and that leaving for Madrid was the ""logical next step"". ""I wanted to discover something else,"" he explained. ""I'd been in the French league six or seven years. I've given everything at Paris and I think I've done well.  ""To arrive at 18, post-youth development, and do everything I have, I think that's something remarkable."" Madrid pushed hard to sign him last year, or at the very least conveyed the impression of pushing hard to sign him. They offered PSG €220 million (£189m/$260m) just before the close of the transfer window – a staggering fee for a player with just under a year left on his contract – and the Madrid media machine went into overdrive. ""Mbappe, tic, tac, tic, tac"" and all that. Nonetheless, PSG remained unmoved, despite the very obvious risk of Mbappe leaving for free at the end of the 2021-22 campaign – which is what many people, including Leonardo, felt Madrid were hoping for all along. ""It seems like a strategy to try to get a no from us, to show that they have tried everything, and then wait a year to get him for free,"" the enraged PSG sporting director told RMC Sport in August. ""For the last two years, Real Madrid have been behaving like this and it is not correct, illegal even, because they contacted the player. It is unacceptable to us."" In the end, though, there were no legal repercussions, and it is now expected that PSG will, indeed, lose their €180m (£152m/$205m) signing to Madrid for nothing at the end of the current campaign. The Parisians are, however, still doing what they can to try to convince him to remain at the Parc des Princes. They have offered him a short-term contract that would make him the best-paid player in a squad that also contains Neymar and Lionel Messi. GOAL also understands that PSG are planning to sign Ousmane Dembele when his Barcelona contract expires this summer. That would be a move not to replace Mbappe, but instead to persuade him to stay, given the two France internationals are good friends. There has even been talk of replacing coach Mauricio Pochettino – who is expected to leave this summer no matter how the season pans out – with one of Mbappe's childhood idols, Zinedine Zidane. The feeling in Paris, though, is that the club are fighting a losing battle, that Mbappe's mind is already made up. Contrary to recent reports, nothing has been signed as of yet. There is no pre-contract agreement, as Mbappe has always been at pains to point out. However, sources say that Madrid are 99 percent sure that the World Cup winner is on his way. They have been waiting a while for him, of course. Madrid first invited Mbappe to the Bernabeu all the way back in December 2012, in the same week that he turned 14. Is Kylian Mbappe dreaming about a move to Real Madrid? 💭 pic.twitter.com/wXJ0WNFEU4 However, while the Spaniards were keen to sign him, Mbappe's family viewed the trip more as a treat than a trial. It was more about Mbappe meeting his heroes, Ronaldo and Zidane, than actually moving to Madrid.  ""My parents wanted me to start my career in France, to be educated in France,"" he explained to L'Obs last June. ""To go to Spain, even if it was with Zidane, it would have been another country, another culture..."" Now, though, Mbappe is ready to go. He's always had what he calls a ""career plan"" and Madrid have always been a major part of it. Florentino Perez has also been working towards this transfer for some time too, reducing the Blancos' wage bill and splashing less cash on new players in recent windows, not just because of the economic crisis caused by Covid-19, but also as a way of making room for Mbappe. Nothing is being said in public, of course, and Mbappe has been particularly keen to play down talk of a switch to Madrid in the lead-up to this week's last-16 first leg out of respect for his current employers. ""Have I made a decision over my future? No,"" he insisted in an interview with Amazon Prime Video last week. ""Playing against Real Madrid changes a lot of things. Although I have the freedom to do what I want at this moment, I am not going to speak with a rival or do that type of thing. ""I am concentrating on winning against Real Madrid. And then we will see what happens."" What is likely to happen, though, is Mbappe will confirm a move to Madrid in May. Something that Al-Khelaifi said would never happen, now feels inevitable.

5635,What is a free transfer in football? Bosman ruling explained,"Free transfers are now an everyday occurrence in modern football, with players often deciding to run down their contracts in order to secure a move elsewhere. In such instances, there is no need for a fee to change hands - but that was not always the case. It took a historic court case in 1995 to make such freedom of movement possible. So what is the Bosman Ruling and how did it influence the transfer market? GOAL takes a look… A free transfer occurs when any given player reaches the end of their contract and no fresh terms are agreed. At that stage, with no legal bond between two parties, decisions can be made to take on a new challenge. Contracts in European football tend to expire over the summer, when domestic competition comes to a close. Players preparing to become a free agent are able to discuss pre-contract agreements with teams outside the country they play in from six months prior to their deal expiring. With no transfer fee involved in moves such as this, lucrative contracts and signing-on bonuses are common, with recruiting sides able to invest more funds into the player themselves. All of this is possible due to the Bosman Ruling that changed the face of football forever. Jean-Marc Bosman was a player at Belgian side RFC Liege when reaching the end of his contract in 1990. He wanted to leave for French outfit Dunkerque, but they refused to meet Liege’s transfer demands and no deal was done. Bosman’s wages were cut by 70 per cent as he was no longer a registered first-team player, and he decided to take his case to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg – where he sued his Belgian employers for restraint of trade. In 1995, a ruling was passed regarding the free movement of labour for professional footballers, with restrictions lifted on players in the EU when it came to transfer fees being paid for those working without a contract. In the United Kingdom, tribunals had been in place since 1981 – and are still used at times when it comes to home-grown players under the age of 24 – but those restrictions were removed as free agents became a familiar part of of the game. It was not just transfer matters that the Bosman case influenced, with other restrictions lifted when it came to European football. A 'three-plus-two' rule had existed prior to a landmark case, with teams prevented from using more than three foreign players in any continental squad, while also having to include at least two that had graduated through the club’s youth ranks. English teams were hit hard by those rules, with it determined in 1994 that Welsh and Scottish players would be considered ‘foreign’. Once the Bosman Ruling was pushed through, sides were free to play as many EU players as they liked, with restrictions only being imposed when it comes to non-EU footballers.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/free-transfer-football-bosman-ruling-explained/blt911adb4c29331153,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
108,Chelsea make contact with Man City over Sterling transfer,"Chelsea are preparing a move for Raheem Sterling after making contact with Manchester City over the forward, GOAL understands.  Thomas Tuchel is understood to want the England international with striker Romelu Lukaku set to rejoin Inter on loan with doubts remaining over the futures of Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic.  No formal bid has yet been made for the 27-year-old, who has 12 months remaining on his current City contract, but he is likely to cost more than the £45 million ($55m) Arsenal are set to pay for Gabriel Jesus.  The England international has yet to say publicly whether he would be open to a move although he is understood to want more game time after slipping down the pecking order at City.  Sterling played more minutes as an attacker than any other City forward last season but competition will increase with the arrival of Erling Haaland, although Jesus will complete his move to the Gunners soon.  He was left out of the starting line-up for a number of big games last season, including both Champions League semi-final legs against Real Madrid and the final day victory over Aston Villa.  Sterling has revealed in the past a desire to play abroad at some point in his career and Real Madrid and Barcelona have shown interest in him before.  After the disastrous spell of club record signing Lukaku, Chelsea are looking at refreshing their squad.  Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen have already left with several big names expected to follow.  Sterling would be Chelsea's first major signing since they were taken over by a consortium led by Todd Boehly in May.  He will lead any negotiations after being confirmed as Chelsea's interim sporting director following the departure of Marina Granovskaia.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-make-contact-with-man-city-over-sterling-transfer/blt31b6f0b78afdc083,Jonathan Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

6045,2022 World Cup qualifiers: Ex-Ghana coach Kwasi Appiah optimistic ahead of Nigeria clash,"Former Ghana coach James Kwasi Appiah believes the Black Stars are more than capable of beating Nigeria to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Ghana and Nigeria are set to battle it out in the third and final round of the African zone qualifiers over two legs on March 25 and 29. The first fixture comes off at Kumasi’s Baba Yara Sports Stadium, with the return leg billed for the Moshood Abiola National Stadium in the Nigerian capital of Abuja.  “It is about Ghana and I will entreat all and sundry to rally behind the Black Stars against Nigeria for us to win,” Appiah, who has had two separate coaching spells with the Black Stars, is quoted as saying by Footballghana. “It is not going to be an easy game, but I believe if we support the team wholeheartedly, we will be victorious.” As the countdown for the double-header continues, a lot of talks have focused on Ghana’s squad which has been kept in secret by the Football Association.  Earlier this week, GFA Executive Committee member Samuel Anim Addo reveals the hold-up in squad announcement is part of strategies to outwit the opposition.  “Strategically, we must keep our opponents [Nigeria] confused; they are confused and the time that they will need to regroup and organise themselves to know what our strengths are will be limited,” Addo told Citi TV. “The players who have been selected [for the double-header] know they are travelling and are already preparing for the game. “The most important thing is that you will get Ghanaians who are going to die for the country.” The World Cup tournament is set to run between November 21 and December 18.  Appiah was Ghana’s head coach as the West Africans beat Egypt, thanks to a convincing 6-1 first-leg home win in Kumasi, to qualify for the 2014 edition of the global showpiece in Brazil. The outing in South Africa was the Black Stars’ last appearance at the tournament, having failed to qualify for the 2018 championship in Russia.

4499,Chelsea see €55m transfer bid for Kounde rejected as Sevilla hold out for €65m,"GOAL can confirm that Chelsea have seen a €55 million (£47m/$56m) transfer bid for Jules Kounde rejected, with Sevilla holding out for €65m (£55m/$66m) for a prized asset. The Liga giants are open to a sale this summer, but are reluctant to accept any offer that falls below their asking price. They are aware that Premier League suitors are far from being the only side in the running, with rival interest from outside of Stamford Bridge ensuring that those in Andalusia continue to hold a strong hand at any bargaining table. The France international defender finds himself at the centre of another long-running transfer saga having spent several windows now dominating gossip columns. Chelsea have been admirers for a while and the highly-rated 23-year-old is eager to take on a new challenge, with a desire to experience a change of scenery having been expressed to current employers. An approach from west London has been made, but an opening bid that includes a number of potential add-ons has been knocked back. Negotiations are, however, at an early stage and the expectation is that Chelsea will soon return with an improved offer. The Blues are not the only side to be shooting admiring glances in Kounde’s direction, with Barcelona also being heavily linked with an approach. Joan Laporta has admitted that, following the arrivals of Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski, the Blaugrana are ready to turn their attention towards further defensive reinforcements. Discussions are ongoing with Chelsea regarding Cesar Azpilicueta, with Andreas Christensen having already been acquired as a free agent following the expiration of his contract at Premier League heavyweights, but asking prices are also proving to be an issue there. Sevilla believe that Barca can match the terms on offer from England and will not look to sweeten a deal with potential player exchange clauses. Azpilicueta moving to Camp Nou could alter the picture somewhat, as more arrivals are welcomed to Catalunya, but Chelsea have made it clear that they will not sanction a switch until suitable cover has been obtained – and their top target, after bringing in Kalidou Koulibaly at centre-half, remains Kounde. To further complicate matters, there have been suggestions that Paris Saint-Germain may be tempted to join the race for Kounde and endeavour to take him back to his homeland. They have been unable to prise Milan Skriniar away from Inter and are ready to turn their gaze towards alternative targets – although no expression of interest has been made to Sevilla as yet. For now, Kounde is having to be patient as he waits to discover what his immediate future will hold. He is not travelling with Sevilla to Korea as part of their pre-season preparations, with recent surgery allowing him to stay behind and work on an individual fitness programme. Kounde will be expected to link up with Julen Lopetegui’s squad in Portugal if no transfer has been put in place by the time they return to Europe, but the hope is that a compromise will have been reached that suits all parties by the time any decision has to be made there.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-55m-transfer-bid-kounde-rejected-sevilla-65m/blt415ea98af5ce568b,Francisco Rico,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3553,Rashford must lift his confidence by himself - Rangnick,"Manchester United coach Ralf Rangnick says Marcus Rashford must pull himself out of the rut which has plagued his season. The England international started on the bench as United drew 1-1 with Leicester, despite the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo and Edinson Cavani. Rangnick opted to use Bruno Fernandes as the striker and started Paul Pogba in behind him rather than give attacker Rashford a shot against the Foxes until he came on as a substitute after 55 minutes. Rangnick admits he did not want to call on Rashford to start the game because he is low in confidence, but says it is up to the England international to resolve the situation. He told reporters: ""I don’t think that [the changes to the team] had any effect on the rhythm of the game in the first half but when we realised after 55 minutes that we need a goal we brought on Marcus for Scotty.  ""He had a yellow card, otherwise I wouldn’t have taken him off, but with a yellow card I think it was the right decision to take him off.  ""Marcus, it’s no secret that he is not having his best time right now, it has to do with rhythm and confidence as well, yeah, again it’s our job to help him to get this confidence back and that is why I decided to bring him on  ""In the end he has to do it himself obviously, but the only thing we can do is speak to him regularly and tell him what we expect from him and what he should do.  ""The rest has to be done by himself. There are quite a few examples this season of players, some of them are still here with us and one or two of them are no longer here, have shown that it is possible to develop within a couple of weeks a level of confidence where you can be a different player again.  ""We all know that Marcus can play better, but again in the end the steps he has to take himself."" Rashford has started just 10 of the Premier League matches in which he has featured this season. He has scored four goals and registered two assists. United's hopes for a top four finish suffered a blow in Saturday's 1-1 draw against Leicester at Old Trafford. They are now four points behind rivals for a Champions League spot Tottenham and Arsenal, though the Gunners have two games in hand.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rashford-must-lift-his-confidence-by-himself-rangnick/blt2fe9f8c2ab05053d,By Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7510,Chelsea sweating on Thiago Silva's fitness ahead of Carabao Cup final,"Chelsea are sweating on Thiago Silva's fitness ahead of the Carabao Cup final after the Brazilian defender limped out of Monday night's 3-1 win at Crystal Palace.  The 39-year-old injured his groin sliding in to block a shot by Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta around the hour mark and could be seen shaking his head when going off. Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino later confirmed Silva felt something in his groin and would be assessed on Tuesday. Any potential problem would add to a growing injury list for the Blues ahead of their trip to Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday and the Carabao final with Liverpool at Wembley on February 25. They are already without defensive options as Benoit Badiashile faces a spell on the sidelines after suffering a groin injury of his own in the 3-1 FA Cup win at Aston Villa.   Wesley Fofana hasn't featured at all this season after injuring his anterior cruciate ligament in his knee during pre-season. Reece James and Marc Cucurella are also out at the moment but should return at some point next month. Chelsea came from a goal down to win at Selhurst Park thanks to a double from Conor Gallagher and another from Enzo Fernandez. The result left them 10th in the table but a little closer to the European places. Veteran defender Silva has started all but two of Chelsea's 24 Premier League matches this season and has also featured in six cup games, a sign of his continued importance to Pochettino. Silva has netted three times. Chelsea did consider selling Gallagher in January but much to his manager's relief, he stayed. 'Always he decided, what he told me, was to stay at Chelsea,' Pochettino said, before being asked if he should be tied down to a new deal.  'It is about him and the club,' the Blues boss added. 'I am not suffering from this type of thing. He still has one year more on his contract (expires June 2025). That is a matter for him and the club.' Chelsea have bounced back since being hammered at home by Wolves â a defeat which put Pochettino under pressure. Since then, they have beaten Aston Villa in the FA Cup and Palace here. 'I don't care about the rumours, the tension, the pressure or the stresses,' Pochettino said. 'We know really well what is our reality and we are going to keep working.'",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Chelsea-sweating-on-Thiago-Silvas-fitness-ahead-of-Carabao-Cup-final/3301175,,13-Feb,all-football-app
9056,'He's ruthlessly focused on winning': Man United Supporters' Trust shares Ratcliffe's 4 key priorities,"Sir Jim Ratcliffe has already taken the time out to meet leaders of the Manchester United Supporters' Trust. The INEOS founder watched Man United's 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford over the weekend. He then stayed back to meet with fan groups and the Supporters' Trust as well. MUST described the meeting as 'positive' and shared the following statement: ""His main message was that everything at United needs to be ruthlessly focused on creating winning teams on the field – something we are sure all fans will agree on.""He also expressed the view that he views our club as a ‘community asset’ and stressed that his purpose in taking a share in United is not to make money."" Stressing the four priorities that must be addressed immediately, MUST continued: ""We were able to set out to Sir Jim what we think the key priorities are – a clear plan to get back to the top, putting in place a football structure with the right people in the right roles; an investment plan in both the teams and the stadium; and building a genuine and strong partnership with fans that supports success.""We hope today’s discussion is the start of an ongoing dialogue both with Sir Jim and his team.""We all know the journey back for our club is not a short one – and the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. But most fans agree that the signals Ineos has sent in the last few weeks are encouraging.""

11151,Man Utd vs Barcelona Prediction and Preview,"Man Utd and Barcelona meet on Thursday evening in the second leg of their UEFA Europa League knockout round playoff tie. We preview the game at Old Trafford and reveal who our Opta predictor thinks will win. If the first leg is anything to go by then we are in for another festival of football at Old Trafford on Thursday night. Away goals no longer apply, so the 2-2 draw in Spain last week means it is winner-takes-all as Man Utd and Barcelona face each other in the second leg of the Europa League knockout round playoff tie. Barcelona are on course for their first LaLiga title since Lionel Messi left the club and Erik ten Hag has Manchester United back in the Champions League places, tapping ever so gently on Manchester City and Arsenal’s door at the top of the Premier League. A Europa League title would be nice for either side, but these teams have their ambitions set much higher. This fixture is a chance to show the world that these two clubs are back and that they mean business once again. Manchester United have only lost two of their last 11 European games at Old Trafford (W6 D3), although both defeats in this run came against Spanish opposition: 0-1 versus Atlético Madrid in March 2022 and 0-1 against Real Sociedad in September 2022. Barcelona have got the better of Manchester United of late, as they unbeaten in their last three matches against them (W2 D1 L0), while they’ve outscored the English side 6-2 during this unbeaten streak. The Red Devils are looking for their first win in fixtures between these two sides since April 2019. Barcelona have faced Manchester United away from home in European competition on five previous occasions. After failing to win any of the first four (D2 L2), they won 1-0 on their most recent such trip in April 2019 (UEFA Champions League quarter-final first leg) before going on to decimate United at Camp Nou with a couple of goals from Messi. Barcelona are missing most of their midfield with Pedri injured and Gavi suspended. Sergio Busquets is just returning from am ankle injury suffered a couple of weeks ago and might not be available for 90 minutes. Ousmane Dembele is back in training but might not make it back in time to feature either. Meanwhile, Casemiro’s suspension in the Premier League means he got a rest at the weekend against Leicester City but is back to play a team he played against 13 times with Real Madrid. United will be without Antony, Christian Eriksen and Donny van de Beek, Harry Maguire and Anthony Martial. It was Total Football at the Camp Nou last Thursday night. Maybe not the type of Total Football Johan Cruyff imagined, but it was chaotic, end-to-end and endlessly fun. Even though it was just the first leg of a Europa League knockout round playoffs tie, it felt like something more important was at stake. Two fallen giants on the rise, trying to prove that they are back among the giants of Europe. United boss Erik ten Hag said after the first leg that “If you face the number one team in Spain in an away game and you are that dominant, you can see it as a positive” and his side did, at times, rampage forward against a hapless Barcelona defense but they didn’t look entirely convincing at the back themselves. Xavi dropped Andres Christensen for Marcos Alonso for the game and the results weren’t pretty. He also played Jordi Alba in place of Alejandro Balde at left-back. The injury to Pedri and suspension for Gavi mean he will have to tinker again ahead of the second leg.  Manchester United followed up Thursday night’s draw with a comprehensive 3-0 victory over Leicester City on Sunday afternoon. That man Marcus Rashford was back among the goals, with a brace. Jadon Sancho also announced his return with a goal. Barcelona beat Cadiz 2-0 with goals from Robert Lewandowski and Sergi Roberto. Those games were relatively uneventful meaning both managers had a chance to get key players some rest ahead of this Thursday night. United have been tough to beat at home this season in the Europa League with two wins and just one loss in three contests. United will be out to prolong a 17-match home unbeaten streak (W15 D2 L0) in all competitions. Barcelona, meanwhile, had one win and two losses in their three Champions League group stage contests away from home. The Spanish side currently find themselves on a nine-match away winning streak in all competitions. In their last six matches in all competitions, Manchester United have won four and drawn two. They scored 13 and conceded five in that period, scoring first in four of the six contests. Barcelona have won five and drawn one in their last six. They scored 11 and conceded three over that stretch, netting first in all six. They have a huge period ahead of them, with a Copa del Rey Clásico at the start of March and another game against Real Madrid in LaLiga shortly after. The next month will define their season starting with Thursday night’s trip to Manchester. Is there anything in the world of football as inevitable as a Marcus Rashford goal right now? He has scored 10 goals in his last 10 games in the Premier League and scored the equaliser last Thursday night at the Camp Nou after Marcos Alonso had given Barcelona the lead. Across all competitions in 2022-23, Rashford has scored 24 goals in 36 games, while he has a career-best shot conversion rate of 22.6% and minutes per goal ratio of 113. Those 24 goals are already level with United’s top scorer last season – Cristiano Ronaldo (24) – across all competitions. Since the return of football after the 2022 World Cup, no player from Europe’s top five leagues has more goals (16) or shots on target (30) in all competitions. These are peak Lionel Messi or Ronaldo numbers, two players with rich histories for either club. Rashford always had the potential to become a star but is now fulfilling that potential and it has been astonishing to watch. Pedri is injured, Gavi is suspended and Sergio Busquets’ status remains up in the air. Frenkie de Jong will be expected to put in a serious shift at Old Trafford on Thursday. What Xavi does with his options in midfield could decide the game but instead of speculating, let’s take a look at a player who is settling into life in Barcelona. Raphinha isn’t quite putting up Rashford numbers, but he has scored five goals since the return of football after the World Cup. The Brazilian’s importance has only grown more pronounced since Ousmane Dembele’s recent spell on the sideline. The French winger is back in training but might not make it back for the game on Thursday. Strangely, Raphinha was taken off after 83 minutes for Ferran Torres during the first leg. It was arguably his best game in a Barcelona shirt, and he wasn’t happy, cursing Xavi from the bench. He had more shots (six) and shots on target (three) than any other Barca player, scoring and assisting a goal too. The Brazilian didn’t start but came off the bench on Sunday after 74 minutes. Starting the game on the bench might have been a punishment or it just underlines Raphinha’s importance to the team as Xavi eyed Thursday night. Barcelona have only won once in five attempts at Old Trafford. The supercomputer doesn’t fancy them to win this one either. It gives them a 29.4% chance of victory on Thursday. Erik ten Hag was delighted with his team’s performance in the first leg, and he’ll be confident of beating Xavi’s side on their own turf. As confident as the supercomputer? It gives United a 44.1% chance of winning this one. The Man Utd vs Barcelona prediction from the supercomputer also gives a 26.5% chance of a draw. If it’s even half as entertaining as the draw in the first leg, the neutrals will be begging for extra time at Old Trafford on Thursday night.

6107,UEFA scrap controversial coefficient plan for Champions League as final 2024-25 format is approved,"UEFA has scrapped controversial plans to offer extra places in the Champions League based on club coefficient after finalising the format of the competition from the start of the 2024-25 season. It had been suggested that two extra places be awarded to teams who fail to qualify through their domestic league based on their historical performance in the competition. That was met with opposition however, with critics arguing it went against the principals of sporting merit, prompting a re-think. The new Champions League format, which was initially revealed last year, will see the number of teams increase from 32 to 36 from the 2024-25 season. One of those extra places will go to a team in the league ranked fifth in UEFA’s national association rankings. Another will be awarded to a domestic champion that progresses through the qualifying rounds. The final two extra places will be awarded to the two highest performing countries in UEFA competitions that season. If that was applied this campaign the extra places would go to England and the Netherlands. The original proposal to award extra places based on club coefficient particularly angered middle-tier clubs who felt it was provided a safety net for more 'bigger' sides who missed out on qualifying through their domestic leagues.  This is a particularly sensitive issue given it is a little over a year since the short-lived European Super League proposal. Instead of the four-team group stage, each team will play eight games, four home and four away, over ten match weeks after UEFA compromised on their initial proposal of ten matches. Rather than eight groups all the teams will be placed into a single group, the so-called ‘Swiss-style’ format that was initially agreed in April 2021. The top eight teams will qualify automatically for the round of 16, with those finishing ninth to 24th going through to a 16-team playoff round. UEFA confirmed that ""similar format changes will also be applied to the Europa League (eight matches in the league stage) and Europa Conference League (six matches in the league stage) and both will also include 36 teams in the league phase"". Commenting on the agreed changes, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said: “UEFA has clearly shown today that we are fully committed to respecting the fundamental values of sport and to defending the key principle of open competitions, with qualification based on sporting merit, fully in line with the values and solidarity-based European sports model. “Today’s decisions conclude an extensive consultation process during which we listened to the ideas of fans, players, coaches, national associations, clubs and leagues to name but a few, with the aim to find the best solution for the development and success of European football, both domestically and on the international club stage. “We are convinced that the format chosen strikes the right balance and that it will improve the competitive balance and generate solid revenues that can be distributed to clubs, leagues and into grassroots football across our continent while increasing the appeal and popularity of our club competitions” Ceferin added the the proposals had been approved by UEFA's executive committee as well as European leagues and national associations.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uefa-scrap-controversial-coefficient-plan-for-champions/blt0f21a30f8ada97d5,Tom Mallows,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

4002,"Odegaard back, with Arsenal vs Liverpool semi-final set to go ahead, despite Kolasinac & Mari exits","Arsenal’s Carabao Cup semi-final against Liverpool on Thursday night looks set to go ahead as planned, with the issues that left Mikel Arteta with a threadbare squad at the weekend beginning to ease - even with Sead Kolasinac gone and Pablo Mari on the verge of an exit. A combination of injuries, Covid and having players away on international duty saw Arsenal's north London derby meeting with Spurs postponed on Sunday by the Premier League. There have since been some suggestions that Thursday night’s Carabao Cup semi-final second leg against Liverpool could also be under threat, but Arsenal are working towards the tie going ahead as scheduled. Despite speculation about Thursday night’s game, Arsenal are hopeful that the clash against Liverpool will go ahead, providing there is no fresh Covid-19 outbreak at London Colney in the next 48 hours. Martin Odegaard, who would have missed Sunday’s game at Tottenham having tested positive for coronavirus, has now been able to return to the club’s London Colney training base. And the Gunners are hopeful that some of the players who have been sidelined through injury, such as Emile Smith Rowe and Takehiro Tomiyasu, could be fit enough to return. The likes of Bukayo Saka, Kieran Tierney and Calum Chambers, who picked up knocks in the first leg, are also hopeful of being passed fit. Mikel Arteta’s squad numbers could also be boosted if needed by two youngsters who have been recalled from loan in recent days. Midfielder Miguel Azeez has returned from Portsmouth, while forward Tyreece John-Jules returned from Blackpool on Monday. One player who does look set to miss out on Thursday night, however, is Cedric Soares, who is still suffering from the hip problem that saw him substituted during the first half at Anfield last week. Both defenders are set to leave by the end of the week, with Kolasinac officially joining Marseille after the French side's announcement on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Mari is close to joining Serie A side Udinese on loan for the remainder of the season. Both players found themselves on the fringes of things under Arteta this season, with Kolasinac making just five appearances in all competitions and Mari appearing just three times, with his last appearance coming on September 22 in a League Cup win against AFC Wimbledon.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/odegaard-arsenal-vs-liverpool-go-ahead-kolasinac-mari-exits/bltceb100b889d631ca,Charles Watts,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8465,Kilmarnock 1-0 Livingston: Marley Watkins' late strike sees hosts to Scottish Premiership win,"Kilmarnock left it late to claim a crucial 1-0 victory over Livingston in the Scottish Premiership at Rugby Park. The visitors failed to convert a number of chances in the first half against their out-of-sorts hosts and they were punished at the death. Substitute Kevin van Veen was the provider, knocking the ball across goal for Marley Watkins to bundle home two minutes from time. Killie strengthened their grip on fourth spot after winning their first league match of the year, while Livingston's miserable winless run has stretched to 17, meaning they remain six points adrift at the foot of the table. Greg Stewart was handed his first start for Kilmarnock and Liam Donnelly replaced Liam Polworth as Derek McInnes made two changes to the team that drew with Motherwell four days earlier. Livingston made four changes as they looked to taste victory in the Premiership for the first time since October. Tete Yengi started in the Premiership for the first time, while Daniel MacKay, Steven Bradley and Michael Nottingham all returned to the side. How the teams lined up Live Scottish Premiership table Scottish Premiership fixtures Download the Sky Sports app Bradley had a weak early shot from distance smothered by Will Dennis, while Kyle Vassell blazed high and wide of the target at the other end. The visitors passed up a good opportunity after 20 minutes when Nottingham rose to meet Bradley's free-kick, though his header sailed harmlessly into the arms of the Killie keeper. It required an important intervention from Jamie Brandon to turn Stuart Findlay's dangerous cross behind for a corner - but the home supporters were growing increasingly frustrated at the laboured tempo of their team. Livingston had the ball in the net six minutes before the break after MacKay raced on to Yengi's defence-splitting pass and rolled the ball home, only to have his celebrations cut short by the offside flag. On the stroke of half-time, Scott Pittman curled an effort just wide with Dennis scrambling and Yengi then prodded wide after being brilliantly set free by Bradley. The home fans voiced their displeasure at the end of the first half and McInnes reacted by making a double change at the break. Matty Kennedy replaced Tom Davies and Polworth came on for David Watson. Shamal George had been a virtual spectator but came up with a brilliant stop five minutes into the second half as he leapt to tip away Kennedy's goal-bound shot. The Livi keeper was at it again on the hour mark, sensationally keeping out Donnelly's close-range header. The home supporters were lifted by the introduction of Van Veen on 71 minutes, part of a triple switch by the hosts. Killie survived a huge scare when Mo Sangare passed up a glorious chance after being picked out by Andrew Shinnie. The Lions almost paid the price for their lack of cutting edge when Murray found Watkins with a pinpoint cross, though he was the latest to be denied by more heroics from George. Kennedy stung the palms of the keeper before the hosts finally made the breakthrough with two minutes left. Van Veen did well to nod Kennedy's cross into the path of Watkins who turned the ball into the net. Kilmarnock manager Derek McInnes: ""We're not going to be in a rush to watch the game back again, but a late winner is always so welcome - sometimes they are the best ones. ""I told the players to enjoy it because it wasn't enjoyable - but enjoy winning the game. ""We struggled for any fluency, we gave the ball away, chose the wrong option and lacked confidence - which was strange as we'd only lost one in 10. ""We'll take that but we need to learn from it, as the season goes on there will be a little bit more pressure on each game."" Livingston manager David Martindale: ""I thought defensively we were very, very good in the shape - we defended very well. ""I felt we had the better chances in the game, I felt tonight was probably more on the offensive players at the club if I'm being brutally honest. ""I don't believe performances alone are enough to make it turn but there are very few performances that I've came in worried. ""I'm frustrated for the players more so than me because I can feel the anxiety and frustration in the changing room."" The attention now turns to the Scottish Cup with a fifth round on Saturday.

An Egyptian forward at Anfield had spoken in the build-up of wanting to get one over on the Blancos after suffering continental heartbreak and an injury at the hands of Sergio Ramos in 2018. The Liga champions ensured Salah endured another evening to forget on French soil as Vinicius Jr grabbed the only goal of the game, and Modric was among those afterwards to remind a deflated rival that he will have to “try again next time”. Brazilian forward Rodrygo told Podpah of the events that unfolded after the final whistle in Paris: “When the game was over, the Real Madrid players made a corridor. “Liverpool were passing by, Salah was going through a little sad, head down. Modric looked at him and said: ‘Thank you, Salah, next time you try again’. I started laughing.” Mohamed Salah is hurting 💔 pic.twitter.com/Tx9S8VJ7sJ Ahead of an eagerly-anticipated encounter between Liverpool and Madrid, Salah had said of his desire to face the Blancos: “I think personally, I would prefer Madrid. We lost in the final to them so I want to play against them and hopefully win it.” He went on to add in a social media post that he had a ""score to settle"". His words had the opposite impact, with Rodrygo revealing the Premier League Golden Boot winner became a figure of fun for Carlo Ancelotti’s squad on the training ground. He added: “When a guy provokes, sometimes you just want to win so you can make fun of them. “In training we used to say 'come Salah, come Salah'… in our head it was already 'we have to win to then make fun of Salah'.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rodrygo-modric-salah-real-madrid-champions-league/blt5b185f8a8119fc70,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2776,What does Roman Abramovich's statement mean for Chelsea ahead of the Carabao Cup final?,"Roman Abramovich's statement about the status of his Chelsea's ownership has stunned the football world on Saturday. It stated that trustees of Chelsea’s charitable foundation would take the ""stewardship"" of the club from him indefinitely. The 109 words initially released were not enough to satisfy all the questions on what it meant but GOAL can explain the situation further. In the simplest terms, Roman Abramovich still owns Chelsea. But he has stepped away from his previously held leadership duties, meaning he will not be involved in the operations of the west London club that he bought in 2003 anymore. Chelsea's motivation is to ensure the club's image isn't further damaged by their association to the powerful Russian figure during the ongoing fighting in Ukraine after Russia's recent military invasion. The trustees of Chelsea's charitable foundation are as follows: Bruce Buck, John Devine, Emma Hayes, Piara Power, Paul Ramos and Sir Hugh Robertson. They will resolve any issues which were usually resolved by the owner in his absence.  This was outlined in the statement: ""I have always taken decisions with the Club’s best interest at heart. I remain committed to these values.  ""That is why I am today giving trustees of Chelsea’s charitable Foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea FC. I believe that currently they are in the best position to look after the interests of the Club, players, staff, and fans."" However, the trustees will not be running the day-to-day of the club, with Abramovich already having been limited to involvement in broader club matters. Director Marina Granovskaia will continue to head up the football operations with technical advisor Petr Cech heavily featuring. The likes of Bruce Buck, Guy Lawrence and Eugene Tenenbaum remain on the board and will continue to run other important parts of the business. Chelsea have gradually moved towards a sustainable financial model, no longer requiring the owner to pump as much of his personal wealth into the club as he once did. Initially, the Blues racked up huge losses when Abramovich bought the club in 2003 but have matured into a solid superclub after 19 years of his ownership. Overall, he has contributed more than £1.5 billion ($2bn) of his personal wealth to sustain the club over nearly two decades. It has been speculated that Abramovich could look to reclaim that £1.5bn, which Chelsea owe him in loans. However, GOAL has been reassured by sources that, just like before, he won't look to have those debts repaid in the near future. There's an appetite in the UK to punish a group of super-wealthy Russian nationals to put pressure on Prime Minister Vladimir Putin after his acts of military aggression towards Ukraine. Stripping Abramovich of his ownership of Chelsea, along with an estimated £152 million ($202m) property is an option that remains open and beyond his control. GOAL understands, however, that he is not seeking to sell Chelsea in the meantime. Chelsea continues to have a budget and cash flow from TV rights, sponsors, player sales and matchday revenue so they can operate. That allows them to conduct a certain amount of business in the transfer market, even though they can't sign any new stars until the market reopens in the summer. It must be said that Abramovich does often get involved in transfer dealings and was involved in the arrivals of Kai Havertz and Romelu Lukaku to Chelsea. Also, he has covered any shortfall on player trading in the past when the Blues have looked to push their budgets to the limits. It remains unknown what effect this will have on the club's business in the summer but it is expected that they will be able to operate in the market uninterrupted without him being involved. It has been argued that these issues of the owner and politics are above the squad, but the timing is far from ideal. With the announcement coming on the eve of the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool, it has likely been a distraction. It is understood that Thomas Tuchel was initially told of a major announcement during the training session ahead of the upcoming event at Wembley Stadium. He also spoke about it being a distraction in his final press conference ahead of his side's shot at their first domestic silverware since 2018. ""The situation in general, for me and for my staff and for everybody here at Cobham, for the players, is horrible,"" Tuchel told reporters on Friday afternoon. ""Nobody expected this. It’s pretty unreal, it’s clouding our minds, it’s clouding excitement towards the [Carabao Cup] final and it brings huge uncertainty. ""To a certain degree I can understand it to such a degree the opinions and the critical opinions towards the club, towards us who represent that club. I can understand that and we cannot fully free ourselves from it.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-does-roman-abramovich-chelsea-statement-mean/blt1b4f60820cabcf38,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5717,Watch: Mourinho serenaded by Inter fans during match against Roma,"Jose Mourinho was serenaded during Roma's clash with Inter as supporters of his former club showed that they still have fond feelings for their former boss. Mourinho managed Inter from 2008-2010, famously winning the treble of Serie A, the Coppa Italia, and the Champions League in his final season at San Siro prior to taking up the Real Madrid job. It's now been over a decade since Mourinho departed but, with Inter up big late in Saturday's 3-1 win, supporters sung the name of their former manager, who acknowledged the support in his former home.

10215,Liverpool vs Fulham Prediction: EFL Cup Semi-Final First Leg Preview,"We look ahead to Wednesday’s EFL Cup semi-final first leg with our Liverpool vs Fulham prediction and preview. Can Jürgen Klopp’s side give themselves a first-leg lead at Anfield? After a dramatic seven-goal thriller when they met in the Premier League last month, Liverpool and Fulham are ready to do it all again in the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup. Jürgen Klopp’s side ran out 4-3 winners at Anfield but had to come from 3-2 down late on to turn things around, and now find themselves top of the table as well as in the final four of the EFL Cup. They are making their 19th appearance in the EFL Cup semi-finals, more than any other side. They’ve also reached the final (13) and won the competition (9) more times than anyone else. This will be Fulham’s first appearance in the semi-finals of this competition. The last time a first-time semi-finalist reached the final of the EFL Cup was in 2012-13, with Bradford City and Swansea City both doing so. Liverpool have never lost when playing the first leg of an EFL Cup semi-final at home, winning five and drawing three. They have also gone on to reach the final on six of the eight occasions their first leg has been at Anfield. In the last round, Fulham dumped Everton out of the competition on penalties at Goodison Park. There have been four occasions of a team eliminating both Merseyside clubs in the same EFL Cup campaign – Manchester City in 1969-70 and 2015-16 (winning the trophy both times), Arsenal in 2006-07 (losing the final) and Chelsea in 2007-08 (losing the final). Trent Alexander-Arnold fired in the winner for Liverpool against Fulham last month but will be unavailable for this one after hyper-extending his knee in the FA Cup win against Arsenal at the weekend. He will be missed by the hosts, having provided five assists in his last four EFL Cup appearances for Liverpool, averaging an assist every 54 minutes in these games. Former Red Harry Wilson, as well as Kenny Tete and Bobby De Cordova-Reid, were on the scoresheet for Fulham in their 4-3 loss at Liverpool. The last Fulham player to score in two separate games against Liverpool in a single campaign was Collins John in 2005-06. As for team news, Liverpool will also be without Joël Matip, Andrew Robertson, Kostas Tsimikas, Dominik Szoboszlai, Thiago Alcântara and Stefan Bajcetic through injury, while Wataru Endo and Mohamed Salah are away on international duty. Captain Virgil van Dijk will be available, though, after missing the Arsenal game through illness. Fulham will be without Adama Traoré, who remains sidelined, but should welcome back Raúl Jiménez and João Palhinha, who were both unused substitutes for the 1-0 FA Cup third round win over Rotherham United on Friday. Liverpool have lost just one of their last 11 meetings with Fulham (W8 D2) in all competitions (all in the Premier League since 2012) and as mentioned, have already beaten them 4-3 at Anfield this season. A Bernd Leno own goal was followed by goals from Alexis Mac Allister, Wataru Endo and Alexander-Arnold as Liverpool fought off a resilient Fulham to eventually secure three points. The Reds have progressed from all five of their previous League Cup ties against Fulham, most recently a 3-0 quarter-final win on their way to lifting the trophy in 2000-01. These results also include a 10-0 victory in September 1986 (the joint-biggest win in the competition’s history), and a 5-0 win in October 1993 that saw a young Robbie Fowler score all five goals.  Fulham have lost their last two visits to Anfield, but did win 1-0 there in the Premier League in March 2021. Liverpool have only lost one league game at home since (2-1 vs Leeds United last season). Liverpool come into this game having won their last three games in all competitions, including a 2-0 win at Arsenal in the third round of the FA Cup last Sunday. They drew with the Gunners just before Christmas, before beating Burnley and Newcastle United. The Reds have beaten Leicester City, Bournemouth and West Ham to reach this stage of the EFL Cup. Fulham had a mixed time of things over the Christmas period, losing against Burnley and Bournemouth before securing a win over Arsenal and beating Rotherham in the FA Cup. The Cottagers have eliminated Tottenham, Norwich City, Ipswich Town and Everton to get to the final four of this competition. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off in this match, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta supercomputer is very confident that Liverpool will take a lead with them into the second leg at Craven Cottage. The first-leg hosts have been given a 73.5% chance of winning at Anfield on Wednesday. Fulham almost took something from their league game there just over a month ago, and have been handed an 11.1% chance of avenging that with a win this time. The draw, which would also be a good result for Marco Silva’s men to take back home with them, happened in 15.4% of the supercomputer’s 10,000 simulations. Enjoy this?

4328,Mosimane: Al Ahly know how to play Champions League matches after dumping out Raja Casablanca,"Al Ahly coach Pitso Mosimane has stated how their experience and confidence in the Caf Champions League helped them to advance to the semi-finals of the competition at the expense of Raja Casablanca on Friday night. The Red Devils were able to qualify for the last four of the African competition after knocking out Raja 3-2 on aggregate in the quarter-finals. With the first leg ending 2-1 in favour of Al Ahly in Cairo, the Egyptian giants secured a 1-1 draw in Morocco. However, it was Raja, who took the lead in the game at Mohammed V Stadium when the Democratic Republic of Congo forward Fabrice Ngoma scored in the fifth minute, but Mosimane’s Al Ahly levelled matters in the 44th minute through Mohamed Abdelmonem. Al Ahly had a penalty awarded by Senegal referee Maguette N’Diaye in the 17th minute, but defender Ali Maaloul saw his effort saved by goalkeeper Anas Zniti. “It was a difficult game. We came here with respect to Raja and we gave them respect. But we have the experience and the confidence to play these games,” the 57-year-old South African coach told the club’s official website after the game. “We won the game in Cairo and we missed a penalty in Cairo and missed another penalty here. We know how to play the Champions League matches and we are progressively improving.” Al Ahly’s first-team coach Sami Komsan has hailed Mosimane’s tactics of preparing the team psychologically well in advance before the return leg fixture. “It was a big game. I’d like to thank the players for being up to the challenge. We managed to play well away from home and be mentally ready for the game. Thank God, we were able to qualify for the next round,” Komsan told the same portal. “In the build-up to the game, Mosimane, Al Ahly’s head coach, made sure to prepare the team for all the possible scenarios that could happen in the game. One possible scenario was what happened today and that was about how to react if we concede an early goal. “Hopefully, we will do our best in order to win the Caf Champions League title for the third consecutive time. I believe such accomplishment would be the first of its kind in Africa and Egypt.” Al Ahly will now face Algerian outfit ES Setif, who eliminated Tunisia’s Esperance Sportive de Tunis 1-0 on aggregate.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mosimane-al-ahly-know-how-to-play-champions-league-matches-after-/blt6b9ac81244b8d962,Dennis Mabuka,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10408,Unlucky 13: Rafa Benítez Can’t Catch A Break at Celta,"Thirteen games into La Liga 2023-24, Rafa Benítez’s Celta Vigo side sit in the relegation zone, but how much of their poor form has been down to bad luck? Forget Newton’s Law and Murphy’s Law; have you heard of Rafa’s Law? It’s a macabre melding of the two that has Celta Vigo in the relegation zone after 13 games of the La Liga season. Rafa Benítez’s start to life at Celta has not gone well. In fact, of all the nightmare scenarios the former Liverpool, Chelsea and Real Madrid manager might have concocted in his head before taking the job, he is currently living one of the worst; the one where his team just can’t catch a break. If football games were 80 minutes long, Celta Vigo would have beaten Barcelona, Las Palmas, and Sevilla this season and drawn with Real Madrid, Mallorca, Girona and Athletic Bilbao too. Instead, Benítez’s Celta sit in the relegation zone and the Spanish manager has come out swinging in press conferences to defend the club in the face of recent bad luck and controversial refereeing decisions. Benítez even asked how many Newtons of force it takes a player to be forced to the ground in order for Celta to win a penalty. They have also succumbed to forces that are within their control. Against Atlético Madrid, goalkeeper Iván Villar was sent off 25 minutes into a game they started well before ultimately losing 3-0. Villar failed to catch a routine cross and bundled Álvaro Morata over as he tried to recover the ball. And then, on the first weekend of November, everything was going smoothly until Rafa’s Law reared its ugly head. They led Sevilla 1-0 before Renato Tapia was sent off after 65 minutes, receiving a second yellow for a needless sliding tackle on Dodi Lukebakio. Galicia is known for its long, wet and cold winters, but it’s November now and Celta Vigo are reaching boiling point. Iago Aspas slammed the VAR monitor to the ground in disgust when the VAR team watching the replay decided the penalty awarded late on against Sevilla – which prompted Benítez’s questions on Newtons – was not a foul by Jesús Navas on Tasos Douvikas. The Celta captain might have just as easily grabbed Tapia and thrown him to the ground because this isn’t the story of VAR versus Celta; it’s a tale of bad luck, bad decisions, marginal refereeing calls and a bend-it-until-something-breaks style of play working against them and compounding into a story for the sadists. If it wasn’t for bad luck, Benítez would be out of luck entirely. Benítez has managed some of the biggest football clubs in the world including Liverpool, Chelsea and Real Madrid. He’s also famous for his rant against Manchester United’s then-manager Sir Alex Ferguson when the Spaniard was in charge at Anfield. So, let’s look at the “facts”. On the face of it, Celta are bad. Seven points from 13 games is the kind of form that earns you a one-way ticket to the second division. They are 18th in La Liga and just four points from bottom. They have scored 14 goals; only Las Palmas, Alavés, Mallorca and Cádiz have scored fewer, but they sit sixth with 18.45 expected goals (xG). At the other end of the pitch, they’ve conceded 24 goals from 21.3 expected goals against. It’s just 13 games but Celta’s 1.35 expected goals per game under Benítez is the best mark of any of the last five Celta managers dating back to 2019. They have only scored 0.92 goals per game, which is the second worst behind only Fran Escribá, who lasted just 12 games before being sacked. The 42% share of possession is the lowest among any of the last five Celta managers and they are conceding 1.85 goals per game, which is also the club’s highest average during the last five seasons. But they’ve also played all four of the league’s best teams and took a two-goal lead in one of those games. They should have taken the lead against Girona too, only for VAR to rule out what looked like a perfectly good goal. They also played – and drew with – Real Sociedad, one of the best teams in Europe on current form. Celta have given up 13 points from winning positions; only Villarreal (14) have lost more points once in front. If they could hold their nerve, they’d be three points outside of the European places now. Instead they’re in the doldrums, with our expected points model suggesting this is comfortably a mid-table team who are underperforming. So that’s the what of their current malaise. But why is it happening? The story of Celta Vigo in recent years is one of extremes. From Eduardo Coudet’s gung-ho high press to Rafa’s more conservative, defensive approach. The thinking, it seems, behind Rafa’s appointment was that Celta, with him in charge, would be able to build a sustainable identity and improve on the club’s position from last season. He has been asked to do that with a significantly worse squad than last term. They finished 13th in 2022-23, just three points outside the relegation zone, needing a final day win over Barcelona to ensure their top-flight status. The goals in that 2-1 victory came from Gabri Veiga.  Veiga played 2,308 minutes in the league last season (sixth-most in the team) and provided 15 goal involvements (11 goals, four assists). The Spanish attacking midfielder was one of the biggest names during the summer’s transfer market with links to Liverpool, Manchester United and Napoli. He ended up leaving the shores of Galicia for Saudi Arabia’s Al-Ahli and was not replaced. Rafa also lost Javi Galán in the summer, a left-back who played 3,162 minutes last season and one of the main catalysts in Celta’s attack. Hugo Mallo, another starter, also left after more than a decade’s service at right-back, where he dutifully soldiered up and down the field. One look at their attacking sequence involvements from last season and you see that four of the players in the top seven are no longer with the club (Veiga, Galán, Óscar Rodríguez and Mallo). The players who have replaced them haven’t contributed enough, as we will see, and Rafa has been forced to adapt to make things work. The player at the top of the attacking sequence involvements last season, Aspas, has been forced to dilute himself to the point where he isn’t the same sharp-shooter Celta have come to rely on over the last seven years. You can’t spell Celta Vigo without Iago. Going into Friday night’s game in Bilbao, there was no player with more expected goals (3.81) yet to score across Europe’s top five leagues than Aspas.  Aspas left for ill-fated spells at Liverpool and then Sevilla before returning to Celta Vigo, where he became the axis upon which everything at the club spun around. Since then, his form has been the only constant at Celta as they cycled through managers after the 2017 exit of Eduardo Berizzo, who brought them to the cusp of a Europa League final before losing to José Mourinho’s Manchester United. Aspas has scored 134 league goals since returning to the club in 2015; only Lionel Messi (188), Luis Suárez (163) and Karim Benzema (151) have netted more often in La Liga since then. One of those came on Friday as he ended the longest drought of his career, but he went on to miss a penalty later in the game, just in case anyone was getting excited about Celta’s luck turning. Benítez’s Celta play in a 4-4-2 with Aspas as the second striker. His role hasn’t changed drastically since last season either. The argument is that Celta, this season, sit back and soak up possession and work on the counter instead of proactively trying to hurt teams, with their 29 direct attacks this season being the most in La Liga. That might be not sound like the place for Aspas to flourish as an attacker but his numbers haven’t necessarily been hurt by Rafa’s arrival; he’s touching the ball in the opposition penalty area the same amount as last season, he’s taking more shots and having slightly more touches. His chances created are 1.4 higher on a per-90-minute basis than last season, with more of a focus on creating than finishing but he is still getting plenty of opportunities. Aspas has the second-highest combined expected goals and expected assists total in La Liga this season (8.3), only marginally behind Antoine Griezmann (8.4), who is considered the star of the league since his return to form upon re-joining Atlético. Aspas looks physically fine, his luck is just out. The detractors will point to how Celta Vigo play. Only ultra-defensive Cádiz, Getafe and Mallorca have a lower share of the ball than they do (42%). As mentioned earlier, they use a 4-4-2 shape out of possession; Benítez did experiment with 5-3-2 after the first couple of games of the season before reverting. However, he’s never truly settled on a midfield pairing – in Celta’s last four games, he has had four different partnerships in the middle of the field: Carlos Dotor & Fran Beltrán, Tapia & Hugo Sotelo, Tapia & Dotor, and Beltrán & Luca De La Torre. They have comfortably the highest PPDA in the league (17.0), meaning on average they allow their opposition more time on the ball before engaging with a defensive action, and they’ve recorded the third-fewest high turnovers (74). The style of play might not be particularly exciting to watch, which is where much of the criticism lies, but it’s not relegation-level bad in terms of the underlying numbers. Four of Celta’s 14 goals have come from set pieces, and with nine open-play goals they’re tied for the fourth-lowest total in the league, but Rafa recently spoke about Celta having more shots than Manchester City. He was referring to totals despite not playing the same amount of games (at the time) as Pep Guardiola’s side. Even if his statistics were portrayed in a way that made his side look better, the general sentiment of what he was saying was true; they do take a lot of shots, but converting them is a struggle. They have taken 130 open-play shots, which is fourth in La Liga, and 175 non-penalty shots in total. They’ve converted just 8.0% of those into goals, however, the fourth worst in La Liga this season. In the absence of Aspas’ goals, nobody has stepped in to fill the void. Last season, Veiga played an incredible supporting role and without his production Celta would have been relegated. This season, Jonathan Bamba is the only midfielder to have scored a goal. Three defenders, Unai Núñez, Óscar Mingueza and Carl Starfelt, have scored one each but Rafa’s midfield haven’t been able to provide goals at the same rate as last season. Luca de la Torre, who has nominally replaced Veiga creates chances more regularly – 1.3 per 90 compared to Veiga’s 1.1, but his goalscoring and shot-taking is much lower, leaving a greater burden on the likes of Jørgen Strand Larsen and Aspas to finish moves, which they haven’t been able to do. The players aren’t available but Rafa will have to find a way to get more from his midfielders in terms of goals before it’s too late. They play another five games before the winter break in La Liga, and three of those are against teams in the bottom half of the table – Valencia (9th), Cádiz (16th), Rayo Vallecano (10th), Granada (19th) and Villarreal (14th). According to the Opta Power Rankings, it’s the easiest run of fixtures of any team in the next five weeks. There’s a big chance here for Celta to climb above some of the teams they’ve performed better than, but there’s also the risk of slipping further into the abyss. Benítez has been unlucky since taking over Celta, and if they can just hold their nerve, he could steady the ship.  The only good thing you can say about Celta’s first 13 games is that their bad luck surely couldn’t continue. Or could it? Enjoy this?

10211,AFCON 2023 Preview: Group A,"We look ahead to Group A at AFCON 2023 with our group stage preview. Hosts Ivory Coast will look to impress but come up against a scary Nigerian attack, while Equatorial Guinea and Guinea-Bissau aren’t there to make up the numbers.  After winning their maiden Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) title in 1992, the Ivorians had to wait 23 years to experience that euphoric triumph again, beating Ghana in the 2015 final. As the Elephants aim to go all the way this time on home soil, they’ll hope it’s less nail-biting considering their two previous successes came via penalty shootouts. Since winning the AFCON nine years ago, Ivory Coast have barely advanced in the subsequent tournaments, only reaching the quarter-finals once. The last edition was underwhelming again, faltering at the round of 16 and losing on penalties to eventual finalists Egypt. Just as everyone has grown accustomed to, Ivory Coast always name one of the most star-studded squads for the AFCON and this year is no different. The challenge has always been whether their vast array of individual talent can work well together. The moment you arrive in Ivory Coast you’re greeted with various ‘Akwaba’ inscriptions bidding you welcome in Ivorian parlance. AFCON fever has been in the air since October, when the country hosted the draw for the tournament. Billboards, mascots and AFCON decorations dominate the streets of Abidjan. Despite the excitement that a major tournament is returning to Ivory Coast after 40 years, expectations are measured. The last time the West African country hosted an AFCON, they were eliminated in the group stages. Anything similar this time and will be deemed extreme failure. The overarching belief is that this is a fairly young and inexperienced squad that can achieve greater things if given time. Though, the consensus is for the team to still try and go deep in the competition given they are hosting. History isn’t really on the side of the two-time AFCON champions, with host countries finding it extremely difficult to win the tournament, especially in recent years. Since 1982, the host countries have won just five of the 19 AFCON editions, with none of the nine hosts across the last eight tournaments doing so. Egypt were the last hosts to lift the AFCON trophy on home soil, back in 2006. Hosting the AFCON has never been a guarantee for success with four of the last eight hosts eliminated at the quarter-final stage. So Ivory Coast, beware. In 2016, Wilfried Zaha switched his international allegiance to Ivory Coast despite playing for England’s youth teams and also featuring in a couple of non-competitive games for the Three Lions. Ivorians were excited because they had at their disposal one of the most petrifying wingers in the Premier League. Fast forward eight years and Zaha’s journey with the Elephants has been underwhelming, to say the least. The Galatasaray winger has only 31 caps and hasn’t made the squad for 42 games due to injury or reasons not stated. The peak of it all is that Zaha won’t be at the 2023 AFCON after he wasn’t included in Jean-Louis Gasset’s final squad. His exclusion can be narrowed down to underperformance and constant criticism of the federation for not doing enough. Luckily, Gasset still has an abundance of attacking talent he can rely on. Haller has been the go-to guy in attack for Ivory Coast over the past few months. He made his AFCON debut in the last edition and scored one goal in the four games he played in Cameroon. He’s since had to battle testicular cancer and therefore missed a chunk of games for the Elephants, but the Borussia Dortmund forward scored on his return to international football in an AFCON qualifier against Comoros. During the October international break, the 29-year-old demonstrated how crucial he can be by scoring in both friendlies against Morocco and South Africa. Although he is yet to get off the mark in the Bundesliga this season despite appearing 11 times, Gasset will count on Haller to rediscover his goal-scoring form over the next month. When Konaté was just 17, he was scoring for fun as he led ASEC Mimosas to the domestic league title. The teenager was rewarded with a place in Ivory Coast’s squad for the 2021 AFCON (which was played in early 2022) — albeit he didn’t play a single minute in Cameroon. It was discernible that Konaté was Haller’s understudy in the national team. The 19-year-old’s integration has been step-by-step to ensure he remains grounded. So far he has 11 caps for the national team and scored two while assisting two in his first start, a friendly against Seychelles. In their pre-tournament friendly against Sierra Leone, Konaté grabbed an assist just 20 minutes after being subbed on. In Austria, the striker remains in the news, scoring eight goals in the Austrian Bundesliga this season. He has blistering pace and can run down the channels to create opportunities for teammates. Two assists and 15 chances created is a testament that he’s beyond just putting the ball in the back of the net. Unlike in AFCON 2021, Konaté will get minutes. Boga, who played for France’s Under-19s, made his debut for Ivory Coast in 2017 but had to wait until 2021 to return to the national team picture. In the last AFCON, he was limited to just 48 minutes of action and he’ll be hoping for more as they play in front of a home crowd. The OGC Nice winger was on the scoresheet during the Elephants’ 5-1 AFCON warm-up win against Sierra Leone on 6 January. Just like Zaha, Boga’s biggest strength is the ability to go past defenders with ease. Among Ligue 1 players who have played 900+ minutes this season, Boga ranks fourth for progressive carry distance per 90 (135.9) and fifth in progressive carries per 90 (11.8). Gradel doesn’t have the burst of pace that Boga possesses. But what he doesn’t have in legs, he makes up with his experience. The 36-year-old, who has amassed over 100 caps for the Elephants, will be playing in his seventh AFCON. Despite playing every AFCON qualifier, the Gaziantep winger has been limited to just 46 minutes in the last five games for Ivory Coast. In the last two friendlies against Seychelles and the Gambia, Gradel was an unused substitute, perhaps a hint of his role going into the continental showpiece. Gradel has created 23 chances, provided three assists, and scored four goals across six previous AFCON tournaments. That’s not too bad for an option from the bench. Ivory Coast conceded just three goals in four games during the 2021 AFCON. However, a closer look at the underlying numbers suggests their defence wasn’t as good as it seemed. The Elephants conceded an expected goals (xG) average of 1.23 per 90 minutes — above any of the other nations considered as realistic tournament contenders and more than double that conceded by both Nigeria (0.57) and Senegal (0.60). On another day, if their opponents took their chances, it could have been a lot worse for Ivory Coast. Odilon Kossounou, Simon Deli and Eric Bailly were the primary centre-back options for Patrice Beaumelle during the tournament in Cameroon. Interestingly, Kossounou is the only one to have kept his place in this year’s squad for the AFCON. In recent times, Evan Ndicka, Willy-Arnaud Boly and Ousmane Diomande have alternated in central defence. Diomande, who is just 20, has been impressive for Sporting CP and is being linked with many top European clubs. He is one of the best ball-carrying defenders in Portugal this season and ranks in the top four for total carries, carry distance, progressive carries and progressive carry distance among all defenders in the competition. If there’s one country that can’t wait for the 2023 AFCON to start, it has to be Nigeria. The past two years have been torrid for the Super Eagles after their round of 16 exit in the 2021 AFCON and failure to qualify for the 2022 World Cup. Even though Nigeria have won the AFCON three times and medalled 15 times, there is a sense of underachievement because Nigerians typically always want more. In 2013, when Nigeria were crowned champions, no one saw it coming. The problem is with the amount of talent they boast these days, everyone has an eye out for them, making an already arduous task even tougher. In case there were any doubts concerning expectations, the official Super Eagles 2023 AFCON theme song has “Let’s do it again” being repeated in the hook. José Peseiro will face similar challenges to Gernot Rohr and Augustine Eguavoen; when you’re the coach of Nigeria, you simply have to win the AFCON. He says his side will fight to win the trophy in Ivory Coast but do Nigerians believe in him? Not really. Peseiro ticks several boxes. He’s very experienced, having worked in Europe, Asia, South America and Africa. He has a master’s degree in sports science. He’s worked with the likes of José Mourinho and Carlos Queiroz, and worked at Real Madrid as an assistant. But none of that matters when you don’t win, especially when you’re head coach of Nigeria. The Portuguese manager has been in charge of the Super Eagles for 14 games and only won six, while losing five. While the qualification process for this AFCON edition was smooth, there’s overall concern about the balance of the team — the majority of Nigerians feel it makes them susceptible to counterattacks. Peseiro’s favoured 4-2-4 formation sees him play four attackers at a time, a system that has worked against inferior opponents like in their 10-0 win over São Tomé and Príncipe in qualification. However, in the recent World Cup qualifiers, Nigeria dropped points against Lesotho and Zimbabwe, conceding in both games. They also lost a pre-tournament friendly against Guinea 2-0 on 8 January. When there are so many in-form attackers in a squad, they must play and that’s what Peseiro is trying to do. If you were to name your ideal type of striker, there is a high likelihood that your answer will be found in Nigeria’s squad. Is it a target man? A striker that runs behind? A striker that can drop deep and play as a playmaker? Nigeria have it all. Like the last AFCON, the build-up has been largely dominated by the strength in depth Nigeria have in attack. The Super Eagles were unlucky in Cameroon as Victor Osimhen (injury + COVID), Emmanuel Dennis (administrative error), Paul Onuachu (injury) and Odion Ighalo (club issues) all missed the tournament. This time, they’ve been dealt the big blow of losing Victor Boniface to injury on the eve of the tournament, with the Bayer Leverkusen star leaving the squad on 8 January. Taiwo Awoniyi, the man who stepped up to replace Osimhen in the previous tournament, also misses out through injury. The usual suspects of Osimhen, Ademola Lookman, Ahmed Musa, Sadiq Umar and Samuel Chukwueze will all be present, while Terem Moffi — who has scored six goals in 16 Ligue 1 games for Nice this season — was the late replacement for Boniface. Onuachu, Cyril Dessers and Leverkusen’s Nathan Tella all failed to make the cut. It comes as no surprise that the Super Eagles scored the most goals in the qualifiers. The headache for Peseiro is who to start with, as in the past few months he has constantly rotated the squad. The temptation to use as many attackers as possible has also seen his team concede in 11 of the 14 games he’s been in charge. The majority of the goals conceded by first-choice goalkeeper Francis Uzoho have been avoidable. The problem with Nigeria’s goalkeeping department stems from the retirement of Vincent Enyeama back in 2015. The Super Eagles have just not managed to replace the man who won over 100 caps for the national team. Maduka Okoye, who was the goalkeeper in the last AFCON, was axed from the team after his error saw Tunisia eliminate the three-time winners. Uzoho has been between the posts for 13 of the 14 matches Peseiro has overseen. Adebayo Adeleye, the only other goalkeeper to get a chance, didn’t make the squad. Alongside Uzoho, the selection includes Olorunleke Ojo and Stanley Nwabili — they have one Nigeria cap between them. Uzoho will likely retain his place in goal, but Nigerians don’t have confidence in him, especially after his mistake cost them a place at the 2022 World Cup. If you have a goalkeeper you don’t trust, your only hope is to outscore all opponents to win games. Osimhen and Boniface are Nigeria’s most in-form players at the present time. A lot of the goalscoring burden in Ivory Coast was expected be on the shoulders of these two forwards. However, following a groin injury, Boniface has been ruled out of AFCON 2023 late in the day and replaced by Nice forward Moffi.  While Moffi is by no means a poor replacement, Boniface has settled quickly in Germany after making the switch to Bayer Leverkusen last summer. His 10 goals see him ranked as the fourth top scorer in the league as his side sits top of the league ahead of Bayern Munich. Across all competitions in 2023-24, only Harry Kane (25) and Serhou Guirassy (19) have scored more goals for a Bundesliga club this season than he has (16) at Leverkusen. Following his removal from the squad, Napoli striker Osimhen will be expected to lead the attack and provide the goals. He is on a mission, especially after missing the last edition of the AFCON. At the time of writing, since the last AFCON ended, only four players have scored more goals within the top five European leagues than his tally of 42. He hasn’t been as prolific in Serie A this season, as reigning champions Napoli have struggled to replicate last term’s form, but the 25-year-old has still scored seven goals — the joint-fourth highest in the league. He showed his qualities in the AFCON qualification campaign, with his 10 goals double that of any other player, although seven of those came in the two routs of São Tomé and Príncipe. The Nzalang Nacional may have only qualified for their fourth AFCON ever, but underestimate them at your peril. The only Spanish-speaking country on the continent has made it out of the group stages on every occasion they’ve qualified, reaching the quarter-finals twice and the semis once. In the previous edition, they ended Algeria’s 35-game unbeaten run while also beating Mali in the round of 16. They gave Senegal a run for their money in the last eight before eventually succumbing. Once again they’re in a difficult group but they’re not here just to participate. Don’t be shocked to see them upset the top two favourites. In September 2020, Juan Micha was reappointed as Equatorial Guinea Under-17s coach. However, when the senior national team was about to play their next match without a head coach, the federation asked Micha to partner with Casto Nopo for the upcoming games. They beat Libya twice and Micha was asked to stay. He eventually signed a contract months later and qualified for the 2021 AFCON. Talk about being in the right place at the right time. Overall, 2023 was an incredible year for Micha and Equatorial Guinea. They went the entire calendar year unbeaten, scoring nine goals and conceding just three across their seven games. They’re disciplined, effective and motivated under Micha, whose animated nature on the sidelines energises the team. Equatorial Guinea are a tough side to beat and can once again be the surprise package of the AFCON. When the African wild dog is hunting, it’s very patient in its approach. It’s a diurnal hunter and uses stamina to its advantage by wearing down the prey before they attack. These wild dogs are called the Djurtus, which is also the nickname of Guinea-Bissau. The people of Guinea-Bissau, like the African wild dog, have had to be patient. They only qualified for their first AFCON ever in 2017. Since then, it’s been a four-peat and they’ve reached every AFCON tournament. The man often attributed with the team’s success is head coach Baciro Candé, who is enjoying his second spell in charge. He’s seen the difficult years and the enjoyable ones, as he’s qualified the national team for four successive AFCONs. One player Candé will look to is the experienced Piqueti Djassi, and his coaches have put their trust in him to take advantage of opportunities where and when they present themselves. With seven goals, the 30-year-old — a former youth international for Portugal — is now Guinea-Bissau’s second-highest goal scorer in history and, behind Mendes, the second-highest appearance maker. Piqueti scored one of just two goals the national team has scored in their three finals appearances and was crucial for the Djurtus in the 2019 and 2021 AFCON qualifiers. In the 2021 AFCON, Guinea-Bissau came closest to their maiden win in AFCON history. Midfielder Pepe saw his penalty in the 82nd minute saved by Sudan goalkeeper Ali Abou Achrine. Piqueti’s rebound struck the bar as Sudan held on to a goalless draw. The result meant that for a third successive AFCON, Guinea-Bissau had picked up just one point in the group stages. Qualification to the finals has become a norm now for the Djurtus, and their record of participating in the four straight tournaments is better than Nigeria, Guinea, Burkina Faso and the DR Congo. The next step for Candé and his men is to get that first elusive win at a major tournament. Two years ago, they found themselves in Nigeria’s group and kept the Super Eagles at bay for 55 minutes. This time the entire 2.1 million population of Guinea-Bissau will no doubt have renewed hope that it could be fourth time lucky. Want more AFCON preview content?

3490,'The humidity was difficult' - Bale admits struggles on LAFC debut despite victory,"Gareth Bale got a taste of American summer when he made his MLS debut for LAFC on Sunday.  The Wales forward was brought on for the final 20 minutes to replace Christian Arango in a 1-0 win over Nashville FC at Geodis Park, much to the joy of the travelling fans.  However, Bale could not produce his best and struggled to find his feet as the mercury hovered just below the 30-degree mark with the humidity close to 90 per cent in Nashville.  Here. We. Go. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿#LAFC | @GarethBale11 pic.twitter.com/LFij8suUsE It was an average outing for the former Real Madrid player whose first touch was a subtle backheel for teammate Jose Cifuentes. Apart from that, Bale produced little for the fans who were cheering every time he touched the ball. After the game, he admitted that he was not at his best and the weather has been a major challenge for him.  Not a bad first touch, @GarethBale11. 👀#NSHvLAFC 1-2 pic.twitter.com/7tUYFg8y2D ""The humidity was very difficult, even in the warmup. It was something that I'm not used to.  You don't really get to see the heat on TV,” Bale said in the post match press conference.  However, he felt that he would have little trouble adapting to the style of play and is already getting used to the team’s philosophy.  ""I wouldn't say [the style of play] is different, it's just getting used to the teams' philosophies. We're working on it in training every day. I'm watching extra films on it in terms of before and after training with the coaches.

Great feeling to make my debut and happy to get the 3 points 💪🏼 @LAFC pic.twitter.com/yo1Q66tOEl Although Bale had a tough time in humid conditions on his MLS debut, the superstar remains motivated to win trophies.  After the slender win over Nashville, LAFC are leading the standings in the Western Conference with 42 points from 20 matches and Bale is eager to help them clinch the title at the end of the season.

11878,Why You Should Care About Florian Wirtz: The New Bundesliga Sensation,"Florian Wirtz is the latest in the long line of young talents produced by German Bundesliga clubs. The Bayer Leverkusen teenager became the youngest-ever player to reach double figures for goals in the German top-flight last month, so Sacha Pisani interviewed their Sporting Director Simon Rolfes to get the lowdown on the talented sensation. “If you have the ambition and quality, we count on you and give you the chance to develop. With development, there is also performance. That’s why it’s a great story for Florian but also for us as a club,” Simon Rolfes told Stats Perform. Bayer Leverkusen had money to splash after Chelsea paid a club-record fee to prise German star Kai Havertz from BayArena at the start of 2020-21. His absence was supposed to leave a glaring hole in North Rhine-Westphalia and prompt a frantic search in the transfer market. But sporting director Rolfes and Leverkusen had other ideas. Rather than use the money recouped in the blockbuster Havertz transfer, Die Werkself opted to look in their own backyard for a replacement – 18-year-old teenage sensation Florian Wirtz. Leverkusen’s faith in youth and their clearly defined philosophy has served them well previously, and they’re being rewarded once again by the club’s latest wonderkid, who has put Havertz well and truly in the rear-view mirror as Europe’s elite queue for his signature. At home in the No. 10 role behind a striker or even as a deep-lying playmaker, Wirtz can do it all on the pitch. Leverkusen prised Wirtz from Cologne in 2020. Dubbed “the best midfielder to come through the club in 30 years” by local newspaper Kolner Express, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig and Liverpool were all circling after Wirtz captained boyhood team Cologne to Under-17 German Championship glory in 2019, but Leverkusen eventually won the race. Rolfes had first watched Wirtz at the age of 13. He was immediately mesmerised by the Brauweiler-born sensation, who has firmly established himself in the Leverkusen XI, quickly becoming the new face of Die Werkself. From his junior days, Wirtz has been great at exploiting gaps and creating space in midfield while churning out goalscoring chances with his devastating awareness. Not to mention his defence-splitting passing ability. Five years on and nothing has changed on the international stage. “Extraordinary player,” Rolfes told Stats Perform. “I saw him the first time when he was 13 and followed him all the time. Spoke with him before he moved to us, with the parents a lot of times and tried to convince them that it was the right step to come to us and accelerate his development. I and the whole club are very happy that he is with us. That’s the interesting thing, I watched him the first time at 13 and he is still playing the same. 14,15, 16, always in that kind of style.” When a player breaks a record held by Kai at Leverkusen, it is a sign to stand up and take notice. Wirtz was swiftly thrust into the first team, becoming Leverkusen’s youngest-ever debutant at the age of 17 years and 16 days, eclipsing Havertz’ record, in last season’s 4-1 rout of Werder Bremen in 2019-20. After a handful of appearances in the coronavirus-hit campaign, Wirtz played 29 Bundesliga games, which yielded five goals and as many assists in the post-Havertz era in 2020-21. In February 2021, Wirtz became the first player in the league’s history to score five goals before celebrating his 18th birthday. So, when it comes to comparing Wirtz to Havertz through their first 42 Bundesliga appearances with Leverkusen, how do they stack up against each other? Wirtz has an equal split between goals and assists (10 each), averaging his 20 goal involvements once every 148 minutes across his top-flight career so far. That’s quicker than Havertz managed at the same stage of his Bundesliga career, with his 16 goal involvements in his first 42 apps coming at an average of 165 minutes. Wirtz also proved a shade more productive in front of goal, with an expected goals per 90 average of 0.16 compared to Havertz’s 0.14, but the now-Chelsea forward was able to get more involved in the average game with 65 touches per 90 compared to Wirtz’s 58 per 90. “I wouldn’t say they’re similar. They’re for sure similar in terms of extraordinary qualities and potential for really big careers,” Rolfes said. “I would say at the end, Kai plays a little bit more forward and is very good in going deep with a lot of speed. Sometimes it doesn’t look like it because he is so tall but he is incredibly fast. Very direct, fantastic shot with his left foot and a good header. With his height, a very good header of the ball. “With Florian, I think from a positional sense he is a little bit deeper. More technique in small spaces I would say. Kai likes to use his speed. They are quite different. They unfortunately only played/trained half a year together. It would be nice to have them both together in the squad at the moment because one right foot, one left. They would fit very good together.” With so much attention from a very young age, it is easy for some players to get swept up amid the hype and interest. Not Wirtz. Wirtz has continue to shatter records and dazzle in the Bundesliga. Against Mainz on Matchday 6 of this season, the Germany international became the youngest player to score 10 goals in Germany’s top-flight, doing so 208 days younger than Lukas Podolski (18 years, 353 days for Cologne in 2004). No player in the Bundesliga this season has more assists than Wirtz (five) through seven rounds. With four league goals in just six appearances, he is already only one goal shy of matching last season’s haul, despite an expected goals (xG) goal value of 1.0 – no other player has such a large difference between his goals and expected goals. His nine goal involvements in this season’s Bundesliga are only surpassed by Dortmund star Erling Haaland (10), while Wirtz has the best shot conversion rate (36.4%) among all players with at least three goals in 2021-22. As Wirtz goes from prospect to genuine star, it all comes down to his mindset. “The attitude is very good. With players and we could see it with Kai Havertz, they know their quality. They are 18 and self-confident because they know about their quality. Special players have that – they can feel that, feel it directly on the pitch. Playing with other good players, they’re able to handle it and adapt to the different speed of the game,” said Rolfes. “In that case, they are quite far [developed] and they know there’s interest in them because also with 14, 15, 16 it’s normal big clubs watched him play. With Florian and Kai, it’s quite the same. They always know they’re interesting and extraordinary players.” In all competitions in 2021-22, Wirtz (11) is the only player in Europe’s big five leagues 18 or younger to be involved in seven or more goals, having already found the back of the net twice in the Europa League. Wirtz has been involved in a goal across all competitions every 47 minutes so far this term – it is the best ratio of minutes per goal involvement of all players in Europe’s top five leagues with at least 500 minutes, ahead of Haaland (51 mins), Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema (52 mins), Bayern talisman Robert Lewandowski (60 mins) and Liverpool star Mohamed Salah (65 mins). “In the youth teams, the difference in the quality between him and others was much higher. The game in the youth is around them. Now, he also has a big influence on the game, but he has to position himself better to get the ball and use his quality. Players with extraordinary quality have the ability to find the right spaces but in professional teams they have to wait a little bit in their position and then use their quality,” former Leverkusen midfielder Rolfes said. “Compared to the youth where they are doing everything.” It’s a frightening thought when you remember Wirtz only celebrated his 18th birthday in May and how much growth there is to come from Leverkusen’s prized asset. Despite being so young, Wirtz is already important in Leverkusen’s attacking production – he’s been involved in 26 open-play attacking sequences in the Bundesliga this season, with only two players at the club involved in more. Of those 26, 12 have come as the creator of the chance, which is more than any Leverkusen teammate. “He will improve year by year. Although he already has a high level. His biggest strength and you could see that in all the years in the youth team, is that he gives his best in each game. Doesn’t matter where he was playing or which teammates he was playing with. The first team, U19, U13 etc, he was always giving his best. That is a key element in his development that he is able to adapt at higher levels but he has ambition to always improve and you have to improve. “Sometimes improvement is also a little bit about changing your game. For sure the opponents want to defend him and watch him, so improvement is sometimes changing a little bit. I’m totally convinced he will have a great career because he has the right mindset to develop. If he keeps that, he is 18 and young, it’s a really young guy and he has strengthen his personality etc – that’s normal. We all know how we’ve been at 18 but if he keeps his mindset and development, he will have a fantastic career.”",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2021/10/who-is-florian-wirtz/,Sacha Pisani,08/10/2021 3:44,the-analyst
5812,Grealish claims to be the best FIFA player at Man City & recalls joining Stormzy on stage at 2021 Leeds Festival,"Manchester City winger Jack Grealish has laid claim to being the best among his team-mates at FIFA, while also revealing how he ended up on stage with Stormzy at Leeds Festival last summer. The England international is looking to help Pep Guardiola's Citizens to a hat-trick of trophy triumphs over the coming months, with the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League all still in play for the club. City will travel to Atletico Madrid in the latter competition on Wednesday, looking to build on a one-goal lead from the first leg of their quarter-final - but if the match was to be settled on the PlayStation 5, then Grealish jokes he would be the best one suited to the job. ""I'm very good at FIFA and I'm the best in the squad,"" Grealish told UEFA.com. ""No, do you know what, I haven't actually played a lot of the lads here. ""I think Zinner — [Oleksandr] Zinchenko — was telling me the other day that he was good. ""At Villa, obviously, I was the best. Out of my group of friends from home, I'm the best."" Grealish also reflected on his unexpected on-stage cameo at last year's Reading and Leeds Festivals, when the winger popped up during rap heavyweight Stormzy's headline set at the latter edition, revealing that the two became online friends over half-a-decade ago. ""When Stormzy first came onto the scene — it must have been about six years ago — I tweeted him because I'd seen him online somewhere, saying something like, 'Stormzy is the next up-and-coming [artist],' and he replied to me and we started following each other,"" he added. ""Since then, we've kept in touch. We didn't plan to meet at Leeds Festival; we were backstage watching Jack Harlow and he was there and he said: 'Come over to my set in a bit'. Obviously I went over and I just ended up on stage with him! It was a bit of a blur, actually.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/grealish-claims-best-fifa-player-man-city-stormzy-stage-2021/blta01436a658f450e4,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6215,PSG consider Nice's Galtier as Pochettino replacement as manager search continues,"Paris Saint-Germain have made contact with Nice over a deal for head coach Christophe Galtier, as the manager closes in on personal terms with the Ligue 1 champions, GOAL understands. The Parc des Princes outfit are widely expected to part ways with Mauricio Pochettino in the coming days, as the club look to move on from the Argentine's tenure in charge, despite reclaiming their top-flight crown last term. A number of candidates have been floated as his successor, but it now appears that PSG are ready to move for the man who masterminded their title loss just over a year ago when in charge of Lille - providing they can agree a release with his current club. While the coach is reportedly holidaying with PSG football adviser Luis Campos, there is still work to be done by the Parisians to secure their man - namely, both agreeing an exit for their current boss and striking a deal with Nice to get their top target. Pochettino's departure - rumoured throughout the course of the season and arguably a foregone conclusion since the club's dramatic Champions League defeat to Real Madrid - still needs to be rubber-stamped, with a package to pay him off required. Likewise, PSG must agree some compensation with Nice for Galtier - who, after guiding them to a fifth-place finish in Ligue 1 this year, may have paradoxically seen his value rise, despite a title triumph one season before. Before Galtier emerged as a potential frontrunner, former Madrid boss and France favourite Zinedine Zidane had been viewed as one of the main candidates to succeed Pochettino. But with those conversations stalling, Galtier could vault into the top position. Zidane has not been in work since he left Madrid for the second time last year, with successor Carlo Ancelotti leading the club to a European double last term.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/psg-consider-nice-galtier-pochettino-replacement-manager/bltca982af9124cfd28,Marc Mechenoua,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

11857,RC Lens: Are the Blood & Gold on the Verge of a Golden Year?,"Stuck in the French second tier for the best part of the past decade, Lens returned to Ligue 1 at last in 2020. Under the stewardship of their manager Franck Haise, “Les Sang et Or” (the blood and gold) finished seventh in 2020-21 and currently sit in second in the table behind PSG, ahead of facing an inconsistent Lyon on Saturday night. This story almost never happened. In February 2020, a few days before the world came to a standstill because of the Covid-19 pandemic, RC Lens decided to dismiss Philippe Montanier and appoint Franck Haise for the last 12 games of the season. Haise’s job was to clinch a promotion to Ligue 1 that was slowly slipping out of their hands. Lens had only won seven points in their first seven games of the 2020 portion of the 2019-20 season. Haise, then the coach of Lens’ B squad, instantly propelled the first team back into the top two by winning what would ultimately be his only two matches in the competition, due to the early postponement of the league forced by the pandemic. Without those precious six points, Lens would have remained in Ligue 2 for a sixth season in a row.  With the job done despite unexpected circumstances, Haise was confirmed as manager for the upcoming Ligue 1 season despite having almost no experience as a head coach in professional football. Fast forward to this weekend where Haise is set to celebrate his 50th Ligue 1 game in charge of RCL. His tenure so far has produced the second-highest points-per-game average in the club’s history in the top flight (1.59), taking into account three points for a win, behind only “Le Druide” Daniel Leclercq (1.64), who won Lens’ only league title of their history in 1998. Over the last two seasons, Lens have won 78 points in 49 games, the sixth-highest tally over that period in Ligue 1. Ligue 1 Table Since Start of 2020-21 Season: In Ligue 1 2020-21, Lens finished seventh with 57 points, the best record for a promoted side since Monaco in 2013-14 (who finished as runners-up on 80 points). They fell short by one point for a UEFA Conference League spot. Far from being satisfied with this debut campaign, in 2021-22 RCL are enjoying their best start to a top-flight season since 2001-02 (when they finished second) with 21 points after 11 games. They sit in second place behind PSG while Monaco (eighth), Lyon (ninth) and Lille (10th) struggle in mid-table. Haise has quickly found a good formula to help Lens punch above their weight. Since the start of last season, the Frenchman has consistently deployed a formation with three central defenders. In fact, Lens are the only Ligue 1 team to play with a back three over since the start of the 2020-21 season.  Those three defenders are asked to take risks with the ball. Jonathan Gradit is very comfortable carrying the ball out from the back, registering the highest progressive carry distance in the big five European leagues since last season (almost 7 km). One of his partners, Facundo Medina, likes to play probing passes forward. The Argentine averages the second-highest number of forward passes per game in Ligue 1 over that same period (28.5). The main asset of this formation is the Lens full backs. On the right side, Jonathan Clauss has been involved in 14 goals in Ligue 1 since the start of 2020-21 (four goals, 10 assists), at least four more than any other defender over that period. This season, half of Lens’ goals have directly come from their full backs, either scored or assisted by Clauss (one goal, four assists) or Przemysław Frankowski (three goals, three assists), his counterpart on the left side. The Pole has already formed a solid connection with Seko Fofana, delivering nine chances to the central midfielder in Ligue 1 2021-22, the most one player has created for another in the league. Fofana, formerly of Udinese, is also one of the key elements of Haise’s Lens. Only Kylian Mbappé (72) has been involved in more shot-ending sequences this season than him (63 – including 32 shots). With a “box-to-box” profile, he’s completed the fifth most carries of all midfielders this campaign (177), also completing 28 dribbles, which is at least double any of his teammates.  Haise has tried to develop a system in which most of his players can score. Ten of them have found the net this season – only Nice have more unique goal scorers (11).  Some key players of their successful 2020-21 campaign are still struggling to find their feet this season, among them Gaël Kakuta, who’s backed up his impressive haul of 11 goals and five assists last season with just one strike in 2021-22 so far.  Lens have also got several promising forwards, including the rehabilitating Wesley Saïd, who scored a brace in Lens’ most recent game against Metz, after a disastrous spell at Toulouse (25 apps, two goals and a cruciate ligament rupture). Ten years ago, Lens wasted what might be classified as a golden generation in their academy (Raphaël Varane, Geoffrey Kondogbia, Serge Aurier). They went into deep financial trouble, and that was matched with disappointing results on the field. It’s clear they have learnt their lesson. Despite a meagre budget, they made smart moves in the transfer market like snapping up Loïc Badé for free in 2020 before selling him on for €17m to Rennes 12 months later. It allotted them some much-needed funds to build their squad for this season, and that squad now has them considering a return to European competition 15 years after their last appearance.

3828,Liverpool hope to beat Leeds to £4m signing of Aberdeen teenager Calvin Ramsay,"Liverpool are hoping to sign Aberdeen defender Calvin Ramsay in a £4 million ($5m) deal, GOAL can confirm. The 18-year-old right-back has been identified as an ideal understudy to Trent Alexander-Arnold, and the Reds are now looking to wrap up the signing as quickly as possible. They do, however, face competition, with Leeds United also keen on the Scotland U21 international. Ramsay has emerged as one of Scottish football’s rising stars since making his debut for Aberdeen last season. He has made 31 appearances for the Dons this season, and is thought to be on verge of a senior Scotland call-up after a string of impressive performances. Ramsay had been targeted by Serie A side Bologna in January, only for Aberdeen to reject the Italians’ offer late in the window. A host of clubs have made enquiries since, but it is Liverpool and Leeds who have emerged as the frontrunners. Liverpool have already taken steps to strengthen their squad with young, British-based players ahead of next season, with Fulham’s Fabio Carvalho, Celtic teenager Ben Doak and Derry City youngster Trent Kone-Doherty all lined up for summer moves. Ramsay, at 18, is seen as a player who can develop into a first-teamer at Anfield, and any deal will be worth £4m, with a number of performance-related add-ons. A move for Ramsay, naturally, would leave questions over the future of Neco Williams, who has spent the second half of this campaign on loan at Fulham. Offers are expected for the Welsh international, and Liverpool believe the 21-year-old’s value is now above £10m ($12m) due to his impressive displays at Craven Cottage. Southampton, Burnley and Newcastle have all expressed interest in the past, while Fulham boss Marco Silva has been delighted with the impact Williams has made as the Cottagers secured promotion to the Premier League. Williams, for his part, is aware of the need to play regular football, as he hopes to secure a starting spot for Wales, should Rob Page’s men reach the World Cup in Qatar later this year.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-hope-to-beat-leeds-to-gbp4m-signing-of-aberdeen/blt43169a06cb43c532,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10822,Spain vs Zambia: 2023 Women’s World Cup Preview and Prediction,"Look ahead to this 2023 Women’s World Cup Group C match at Eden Park, Auckland with our Spain vs Zambia preview and prediction.   Spain will once again be heavy favourites on Matchday 2, having flexed their muscles and coasted to a 3-0 win over Costa Rica in their Group C opener against Costa Rica.  That win was Spain’s biggest ever at a Women’s World Cup, and their 46 shots, 80% possession and 117 touches in the opponents’ box were all highs for a game at the tournament since at least 2011.  Wednesday’s game could be a long one for Zambia, whose inauspicious start saw them battered 5-0 by Japan. The debutants failed to register a single shot in that match and their chances of producing a shock against Spain were dealt a further late blow with the red card for goalkeeper Catherine Musonda.  Zambia were always likely to be heavily reliant on Barbra Banda going forward, and she had three of their five touches in the Japan box on MD1. But by comparison, eight of Spain’s 15 outfield players used against Costa Rica had as many touches in the opposition’s box as Zambia’s entire team, highlighting how much of a mismatch this could end up being.  Esther González (21) and Jenni Hermoso (20) accounted for a lot of those touches in the Costa Rica area; no other player tallied as many as 20 in a single game at any of the previous three Women’s World Cup tournaments.   Zambia’s MD1 defeat was the third heaviest suffered by an African nation after Ivory Coast’s 10-0 loss to Germany in 2015 and Morocco’s 6-0 defeat, also to Germany, in this tournament. Given the domination Spain enjoyed against Costa Rica, it’s difficult to see Jorge Vilda’s side not cruising here.  If there’s one omen Zambia can look to, it’s that Spain have lost on MD2 in each of their two previous appearances at the Women’s World Cup – admittedly, those were inflicted by Brazil (2015) and Germany (2019).  Spain have only ever played one match against an African nation at the Women’s World Cup; they beat South Africa 3-1 in their tournament opener in 2019.  Their last game against an African country in any match was way back in October 2021 when they defeated Morocco 3-0.  However, Zambia did beat Germany 3-2 during their Women’s World Cup preparations, also pushing Switzerland all the way in a 3-3 draw. We’ve already seen some big scores and one-sided matches at this tournament, which was perhaps to be expected given the expansion to 32 teams; there’s a significant chance this trend will continue here.  The Opta supercomputer considers Spain massive favourites for this match, rating their win probability at 93.1%.  That means Zambia have less than a 7% chance of getting just a point, with the likelihood of them winning just 3%.   Make no mistake, a Zambia victory would be one of the biggest Women’s World Cup upsets ever; it seems far more likely Spain will rack up a big score.  Spain: María Isabel Rodríguez, Enith Salón, Catalina Coll, Ona Batlle, Irene Paredes, Ivana Andrés, Oihane Hernández, Laia Codina, Olga Carmona, Rocío Gálvez, Teresa Abelleira, Aitana Bonmatí, Irene Guerrero, Alexia Putellas, María Pérez, Claudia Zornoza, Mariona Caldentey, Esther González, Jennifer Hermoso, Eva Navarro, Salma Paralluelo, Alba Redondo, Athenea del Castillo.  Zambia: Catherine Musonda, Eunice Sakala, Hazel Nali, Margaret Blemu, Martha Tembo, Lushomo Mweemba, Agness Musase, Esther Banda, Judith Soko, Mary Mulenga, Vast Phiri, Ireen Lungu, Hellen Chanda, Evarine Susan Katongo, Mary Wilombe, Susan Banda, Avell Chitundu, Hellen Mubanga, Xiomara, Mapepa, Grace Chanda, Racheal Kundananji, Barbra Banda, Ochumba Lubandji.  Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

1924,Rabiot's mother blasts critics for trying to 'destroy' Juventus midfielder,"Adrien Rabiot's mother Veronique has blasted critics for trying to ""destroy' the Juventus star, insisting he ""has nothing to prove"". Rabiot joined Juventus on a free transfer in the summer of 2019 after leaving Paris Saint-Germain. The Frenchman has struggled to live up to his big billing at Allianz Stadium, but his mother believes he does not deserve such criticism. Veronique, who is also Rabiot's agent, has come out to defend her son and offer an insight into the ""sacrifices"" he's made throughout his career. “I don’t know where the negative image that the media has of us comes from, they destroy us all the time,” she told Ouest-France. “Adrien has nothing to prove, he plays football and it is his passion on and off the pitch. “When he’s not playing, he’d like to have a decent life and not spend time justifying himself. In Italy, they say that it is not good enough, but he does not care about playing all games. “The goal of players is to reach the maximum levels, but not everyone knows how many sacrifices it takes and what a strong mentality one must have to face this life. Everyone thinks they are paid too much, but they know nothing. “They’ve never forgiven anything to my son. He’s always been criticised since he was 17. Everyone makes mistakes. Footballers are not robots. We have an excellent relationship, in private and professional life. I don’t understand why media are always targeting us, maybe because we don’t speak much with them.” Rabiot has appeared in 120 games across all competitions for Juventus, including 36 in the current campaign. The 26-year-old has recorded a modest total of six goals and six assists while helping the club win Serie A, Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana honours.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rabiot-mother-critics-destroy-juventus/blt2db77adb10ee2f72,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6136,"Man Utd-linked Milinkovic-Savic 'will not remain in Italy' if he leaves Lazio, says Sarri","Lazio coach Maurizio Sarri has admitted that Sergej Milinkovic-Savic “will not remain in Italy” if a big-money transfer is to be completed this summer, with the highly-rated midfielder continuing to generate talk of interest from Manchester United. Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid have also been linked with the 27-year-old Serbia international, who has returned to top form this season with 11 goals and 12 assists across all competitions. Those qualities are attracting admiring glances from across Europe, with Sarri conceding that a deal could be done in the next window if an ever-increasing asking price in the Italian capital is met by any of Milinkovic-Savic’s many suitors. Lazio have been eager to point out on a regular basis in recent years, since seeing Milikovic-Savic burst onto the scene with 14 goals in the 2017-18 campaign, that they will not be parting with any prized assets without a fight. That remains the official stance at Stadio Olimpico, but Sarri accepts that a club from outside of Italy may look to force the issue, saying when quizzed on renewed transfer talk: “Speaking to the President, I have become convinced that if Milinkovic does leave, and that will not happen easily, he will not remain in Italy.” The Serbian star joined Lazio from Genk in the summer of 2015 and is currently working on a contract through to 2024. Juventus are another of the sides to have been linked with him of late, but Sarri’s comments appear to rule them out of the running. Milinkovic-Savic has offered no indication that he is ready to push for a move elsewhere, as he discusses a potential top-four challenge in his current surroundings next season, but he is aware that his game is being taken to greater heights. Speaking after Lazio's 2-2 draw with Juventus on Monday, during which he scored a stoppage-time equaliser, the midfielder told Sky Italia of the form that is generating so much interest: “I improved under Sarri, I scored 11 goals and provided 11 assists, so I can say this has been the best season of my career. “Next season, we need a few more players so we can aim for the Champions League places.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-linked-milinkovic-savic-will-not-remain-in-italy/blt9b561c638720e35a,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11616,Championship 2021-22: The Alternative Player Awards,"Fulham and Bournemouth have made it back to the Premier League, while four teams will battle it out for the final promotion spot via the playoffs. Seasonal player awards have been decided across the EFL, but we’ve decided to look at some alternative awards for the best of the 2021-22 Championship crop. Everybody knows he topped the scoring charts with a phenomenal 43 goals in 44 Championship appearances for Fulham, but Aleksandar Mitrovic also found himself in the best positions to score across the whole competition in 2021-22. The Serbian’s expected goals total of 35.6 was the highest among all Championship players, with his 30.1 xG from non-penalty shots also the best. To post over six goals more than his xG was an impressive feat, but he still couldn’t find the chances to post an all-time second tier scoring record of 60 goals to surpass George Camsell’s efforts for Middlesbrough in 1926-27. We’re afraid we can’t verify the ‘Boro striker’s expected goals from 95 years ago, however. Of all players to have played 500 minutes or more in the top four tiers of English league football this season, the Serbian averaged the highest non-penalty xG per 90 (0.71) Mitrovic’s 43 goals this season surpassed his total goal tally in the Championship across three previous campaigns (42 goals in 82 apps), so maybe he could pose more of a threat to Premier League defences next season than he has in the past. Would Aleksandar Mitrovic have scored so many goals this season without the creativity of Harry Wilson behind him? The former Liverpool winger assisted 19 goals for Fulham in their title-winning Championship season – a tally that no player within the top four tiers of England could match. Wilson also posted a joint-league-high 102 chances created – level with John Swift, while 80 of those came from open play situations, which was more than any other Championship player this season. Both his overall expected assists total (10.4) and his open play expected assists total (9.1) surpassed any other player in the competition, while only two players have exceeded Wilson’s xA total across the last three Championship campaigns: Saïd Benrahma (11.9 in 2019-20) and Emiliano Buendía (12.4 in 2020-21). Both of those players have done alright in the Premier League since.Wilson’s most creative game came in their 7-0 rout of Luton earlier this month, with seven chances created on his own (no player had more in a Championship match this season), with three of those converted to give him a hat-trick of assists – this made him one of only three players to assist three or more goals in a Championship game in 2021-22. After an initial loan spell in 2020-21, Coventry City made Viktor Gyökeres a permanent signing in the summer from Premier League club Brighton. Based on his performances for the Sky Blues this season, it might not be long until he makes it back to the top flight. The Swedish international was the most threatening player in the Championship in 2021-22 via attacking ball carries, with his constant running at opposition defenders seeing him post a league-high 83 shot involvements from these situations – 62 shots and 21 chances created for team-mates. In the 4-1 demolition of Sheffield United in March, Gyökeres was at his very best. He scored the opening goal, while being involved in seven of Coventry’s shots following one of his ball carries (four shots, three chances created) – a league-high tally in a single Championship game in 2021-22. Only Brentford pair Saïd Benrahma (90 in 2019-20) and Ollie Watkins (88 in 2017-18) have surpassed Gyökeres’ output from carries in a single campaign across the last seven Championship seasons – not bad company to keep. Dominic Solanke can consider himself very unlucky. The Bournemouth striker scored an excellent 29 goals in the Championship during their successful promotion campaign in 2021-22, improving on his 15 goals the season before. Across the last 22 Championship seasons, that tally would have been enough to win the Golden Boot award in the competition (we’re not including playoff goals) on 20 occasions – with his tally only beaten this season by Mitrovic and in 2020-21 by Ivan Toney (31). Despite being outscored by Mitrovic, Solanke was the only player more active in the penalty area than the Fulham striker, with a league-high 333 touches in the opposition box – 29 more than the Serbian managed. Solanke also topped the Championship charts for shots following a one-two, with 12 of his strikes seeing him play a pass to team-mate before receiving a return ball and shooting. Yes, this is a nice metric, but having that understanding with team-mates in attacking situations should bode well for 2022-23 in the Premier League. It’s been five years since Solanke won the Golden Ball as the best player as England won the Under-20 World Cup. He struggled to make an impact in the Premier League following that success, with only four goals in 63 appearances across three seasons, but there’s every chance that two seasons in the second tier have given him the platform to succeed in the top-flight with his next opportunity. It wasn’t until November that Wes Foderingham managed to win the first-choice goalkeeper position at Sheffield United, but once he sealed the spot there was no looking back. The 31-year-old kept a brilliant 18 clean sheets in just 32 Championship appearances (56%). The only other goalkeeper to play at least 20 times in the division and keep a clean sheet in a higher proportion of his matches across the last 10 seasons was Watford’s Daniel Bachmann last season (57%). His saves have given him a league-high goals prevented value of 8.4, meaning his 22 goals conceded (excluding own goals) should have been nearer 30 based on the quality of shots on target faced (expected goals on target). Foderingham’s performances haven’t gone unnoticed by his Sheffield United team-mates, who voted him their Players’ Player of the Year at the weekend ahead of the playoffs. No player made more tackles and interceptions combined in the Championship across 2021-22 than Blackburn Rovers’ Lewis Travis (191). The combative midfielder topped the league ranking for tackles alone (106), while his 85 interceptions were only behind Michal Helik (96) and Kristian Pedersen (92). Overall, Travis regained possession and started an open-play passing sequence for Blackburn on 219 occasions across the season, the third-highest value of any player in the Championship – 13 of these ended in a shot for his team (only four players had more) showing his importance to Rovers. Harry Souttar was enjoying a strong campaign with Stoke City before disaster struck in November while on international duty with Australia – he suffered a season-ending ACL injury. At the time, Stoke City were well placed for a promotion charge and in fifth place, with Souttar a key part of a defence that had conceded just 19 times in 17 games. Across his 1,428 minutes on the pitch in 2021-22, Souttar won an incredible 75% of duels (109/146) and 78% of aerial duels (71/91) – both league highs of all players with a considerable number of duels contested.  How impressive are these numbers? The last defender to win at least 75% of duels (with 100+ contested) and win at least 78% of aerial duels (with 80+ contested) in a single Championship season was Matt Miazga in 2018-19 for Reading. With Souttar playing less than half the season, Fulham defender Tosin Adarabioyo also needs to get a mention for his strong duel success rate. His overall duel success stood at 69% (179/258) and in aerial battles this success rate stood at 74.1% (123/166) – both ratios were only below that of Souttar’s. Who doesn’t love a player that takes on opponents with the ball at his feet? Blackpool fans have been able to enjoy arguably the best of these in 2021-22 via the skillset of winger Josh Bowler. The 23-year-old was the only Championship player to beat opponents at least 100 times in the 2021-22 season (104), while he also topped the rankings for drives into the box (23) and shots following a take-on (13). Of all players to have played at least 2000 minutes in the Championship across the season, Bowler attempted a league-high 7.4 take-ons per 90 minutes – well above the next highest in Siriki Dembélé (5.9). Bowler’s end product could be improved, with just seven goals and three assists across his 42 appearances, but when in form he showed what he was capable of producing – between January and the start of March, he scored six goals in eight games for Blackpool. Of non-defenders to play at least 1500 minutes in the Championship across this season, the only player to progress upfield with ball carries more than 115 metres per 90 minutes on average was Bowler (144m) – he’s an ideal player to have in a team looking to transition quickly between defence and attack, and having just signed a contract extension at Blackpool, it looks like their fans will get another season of enjoying his direct style of play. Matt Grimes has been one of the most established midfielders at this level for a few seasons now, so it comes as no surprise to learn that he was the player to average the most successful passes (90) and touches of the ball (111) per 90 minutes in the Championship in 2021-22. Of the 15 highest successful pass tallies in a single Championship match this season, 10 were by Grimes – admittedly something to be expected when playing for such a possession-hungry side like Swansea City. His 151 successful passes in the January meeting with Huddersfield was the highest in a Championship match by a midfielder in recorded history (since 2013-14). He’s not just adept at passing, but more than capable to carrying the ball too. Grimes embarked on more carries (890) and progressive carries (433) than any other Championship midfielder in 2021-22, while his total progressive carry distance of 4,256m was also the highest of any central midfielder in the competition across the season. Grimes ended the season as one of only four outfield players to play every single minute of the Championship campaign for his club (4,140 minutes). He has played a part in each of Swansea’s last 86 Championship matches, while he’s only missed 23 minutes across the last 80 games in total for the Swans – a consistent performer. We can’t hand out awards for everything, but we think each of the below feats deserve a mention in our end of season wrap up… Darnell Furlong attempted the most shots (42) and had the highest expected goals total (4.33) without scoring a goal in the Championship this season. Overall, it’s now 58 shots without scoring a league goal since his December 2020 strike against Newcastle United in the Premier League. Duane Holmes created the most chances for his team-mates in the Championship this season without assisting a goal (30). With his Huddersfield Town side in the playoffs, it’s about time one his fellow Terriers converted a chance created by the American. The highest quality chances created by a single player (expected assists) without a single assist on the board is a record that belongs to Nottingham Forest’s Ryan Yates (2.9 xA) – the quartet of Alan Browne, Emil Riis Jakobsen, Kenneth Dougall and Cameron Jerome all notched five assists apiece despite having an xA total lower than Yates.Uche Ikpeazu made 33 appearances in the Championship in 2021-22 but didn’t play the full 90 minutes in any of them – he was substituted on 24 times and replaced on the other nine occasions. This is the most appearances by a player in the competition this season without playing a full match. Carlos Richards wins the award for the shortest amount of time on the pitch in the Championship this season. The 16-year-old Derby winger spent just 46 seconds on the pitch, but this also meant he did play in a win against the Champions in 2021-22. Richards did touch the ball once, though – this beats Joe Rodwell-Grant’s record of being the only player to appear in the Championship this season without touching the ball once. His appearance was 53 seconds long, in Preston’s 3-1 win over Swansea in August. The most minutes played in a Championship match while being successful with just a single pass is a record that belongs to Luton’s Admiral Muskwe in a 1-1 draw with Fulham in December. The Zimbabwean played 78 minutes but could only complete one pass overall. Bournemouth’s Lloyd Kelly scored an own goal both home and away against Luton Town this season – the last player to score an own goal home and away against the same side across the top four tiers of English league football in a single season was Anthony Grant versus Bristol Rovers (for Southend) in 2009-10’s League One season. Danny Hylton only attempted four shots on target in 2021-22 for Luton Town, but he scored with every single one of them – impressively none of these were from the penalty spot, either. The ‘Give Someone Else a Try’ award goes to Peterborough United’s Jonson Clarke-Harris, as he attempted the most shots from direct free kicks without scoring one (17). Conversely, Cardiff City’s Ruben Colwill only attempted one – and he scored from it. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

2607,Barcelona frustrated by Rayo Vallecano as Lewandowski & Raphinha's La Liga debuts spoiled,"WHAT HAPPENED? The new era at Barcelona didn't get off to the start Xavi would have wanted. His players were unable to break down a resolute Rayo Vallecano who defended brilliantly throughout the 90 minutes. Sergio Busquets and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang came closest to a breakthrough, but the former then didn't finish the match as he was sent off in stoppage time. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Given all Barcelona have been through in recent years, this was far from a disaster, however it was still somewhat deflating given the hype around the squad after the summer additions of Raphinha and Lewandowski, among others. It was clear that the new signings are not quite used to playing together as a unit, something they will hope to rectify in the coming weeks and months. ALL EYES ON: Lewandowski was the man of the moment at Camp Nou but his La Liga debut was ultimately underwhelming. During the first half, he put the ball in the back of the net but was a couple of yards offside. There were, however, a few signs that it won't take him long to adapt to Spanish football, as his movement was positive. THE MATCH IN THREE PHOTOS: DID YOU KNOW? Including the final two games of last season, Barcelona have failed to score in three consecutive La Liga matches for the first time in 19 years. WHAT'S THE VIBE? There was plenty of attention on one of the players who wasn't included in the starting XI... Meanwhile in Barcelona... 😅 pic.twitter.com/8vayKo2hC7 After 45 minutes, you wouldn't have necessarily known which team had spent all the money in the summer. The mighty Rayo Vallecano who have spent €0 this summer are currently holding Barcelona 0-0 at half time at the Camp Nou The highlight of a pretty drab first half was some spell-binding footwork from Pedri. Pedri 😳#LaLigaHighlights pic.twitter.com/qUflXt4SWw Xavi might have an embarrassment of riches at his disposal but his side didn't do enough on opening night. This Barcelona squad is silly. Frenkie De Jong, Ansu Fati and Franck Kessie coming off the bench ffs. Aubameyang and Ferran Torres still available. Very silly. The late red card for Busquets summed up a frustrating evening for Barca at Camp Nou. That sums up Barcelona’s night Sergio Busquets sent off for a second yellow card, just lost his head and elbowed Falcao. The frustration has boiled over for Barcelona this evening, very poor opening day performance especially in the final third. WHAT NEXT FOR BARCELONA? On the first weekend of the season, it is hardly catastrophic that Barcelona have only been able to draw with a well-drilled Rayo side. There will be plenty of improved performances when the new signings are allowed time to adjust to the club. Perhaps the right formula will emerge during a tough upcoming trip to face Real Sociedad.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-frustrated-rayo-vallecano-opening-night/bltcd5e7b01eea1ab09,Ed Mackey,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8846,Ten Hag names 'smart player' in Man United squad - not Bruno,"Ahead of the draw with Tottenham Hotspur, Erik ten Hag described Christian Eriksen as a smart player who can make a difference. “He is a smart player,” the Man United manager said. “He can make the difference, he scans for passes and he can give them. He has that ability — not many players have that.”Indeed, Eriksen alongside Bruno Fernandes are United's most creative players. However, the Danish midfielder must work on his defensive side. According to The Athletic, Eriksen has managed 1.38 tackles per 90 minutes - the fewest of any United midfielder. His 0.32 interceptions is the lowest of any player other than Marcus Rashford.

9033,"Deco picks powerful midfield workhorse to replace Romeu, his price tag unveiled","Barcelona have been searching for a physical midfielder that comes in the mould of Yaya Toure and for Barca's sporting director Deco, no player fits the bill better than Everton's Amadou Onana, sources say. Onana has been showcasing his abilities in the English Premier League with rumours linking him to top clubs like Chelsea and Manchester United.According to AS, Onana will cost Barca around €40m in the summer. It's a decent player for a workaholic defensive midfielder but Barca cannot cough up that summer without offloading some players first. Players like Frenkie De Jong and Ronald Araujo could be placed on the chopping board as their sale will bring the financial windfall Barca needs to escape FFP sanctions while signing players like Onana. Onana will naturally replace Oriol Romeu in Barca's midfield with the Spaniard having underperformed since arriving from Girona. Stats show Onana is exactly the sort of player Barca have desperately lacked for years as he's a tough tackler and water-carrier brand of midfielder who operates box-to-box. Over the past year, FBref's graph shows Onana is among the top 21% of defensive midfielders in Europe for tackles and among the top 7% for aerial duels. It shows Barca that Barca eyeing a powerful midfield workhorse. The question is, can they afford him?

6704,Liverpool and Man City fan farce shows why Wembley must be dropped as FA Cup semi-final venue,"The first time Wembley hosted an FA Cup semi-final, everyone was happy. It was 1991, and Tottenham were taking on Arsenal. Was Gascoigne going to have a crack? He was, you know. Two north London teams facing off in a north London stadium? Perfect. The decision was the right one, and not just in a financial sense. And the novelty of another televised game beneath the Twin Towers? Well that was just great, wasn't it? A rare treat, if you will. That was then, though, and this is now. And, in 2022, it is clear that something has to change.  Wembley’s days as a semi-final venue should be numbered, and not just because of the crisis which has emerged over the last 48 hours. You may have heard about the situation facing Liverpool and Manchester City fans right now. One of travel chaos, hefty costs and long, inconvenient journeys. English football in a nutshell, you could say. The sides are due to face each other at Wembley next month, most likely Saturday, April 16. The problem is, that’s Easter weekend, and what tends to happen in this country over Easter weekend is that rail networks plan “essential maintenance”, which leads to line closures, cancellations and significant inconvenience for travellers and commuters. Sure enough, that’s exactly what’s happening this year. So, if you are planning to travel from Liverpool or Manchester to London that weekend, then best of luck. You’ll have a job on your hands. Avanti West Coast has confirmed that between April 15-18, no trains will operate to or from London Euston. Services will instead begin and terminate at either Milton Keynes, some 53 miles away, or at Rugby, even further north. It means that for the vast majority of supporters, rail travel is impossible. Fans looking to travel from Liverpool on the Saturday would face a journey time of around six hours, featuring at least three train changes. Supporters heading down from Manchester, meanwhile, would need to do so via Sheffield or Banbury.  Spirit of Shankly, the Liverpool supporters’ union, said it was “appalled” at the “shambolic” situation facing fans, and on Monday evening it released a statement, together with Manchester City’s 1894 Group, calling for the tie to be switched from Wembley. “More than 64,000 travelling supporters will be forced onto the roads, which will already be over-burdened with Bank Holiday traffic,” it read. “For the other semi-final between Chelsea and Crystal Palace, Wembley makes sense. For Liverpool and City, it makes no sense. “We are asking both clubs, the FA and Wembley to reconsider where this game is played and, for once, to put the fans at the forefront of their thinking.  “City and Liverpool are less than 40 miles apart and there are plenty of grounds big enough far closer than Wembley to stage such a prestigious game.” Wembley Semi-Final Travel Chaos. Zero consideration has been given to fans travelling to our FA Cup semi-final with Manchester City. #ChangeTheVenueLink: https://t.co/bOUufdtANb@WeAre1894 @LFC @ManCity @EmiratesFACup @wembleystadium pic.twitter.com/1XJ6OzMHmA The Football Association (FA), too, released a statement on Monday saying it would “liaise closely” with both Liverpool and Manchester City, as well as with Network Rail and National Express (the inter-city coach operator) to “find a solution so that supporters of both teams are able to travel to and from the fixture with as minimal disruption as possible.” But it has since emerged that they were made aware of the potential for disruption to these semi-finals as far back as 2019, and that a request to consider changing the venue from Wembley was made last September. This is no last-minute shock, this was an avoidable situation. GOAL understands that it is unlikely that the fixture will be moved. Old Trafford, which would appear an ideal alternative venue on the face of it, is unavailable that weekend as Manchester United are playing Norwich in the Premier League, while other options such as Goodison Park, Villa Park or Elland Road would not be deemed big enough, despite all having hosted FA Cup semi-finals on numerous occasions in the past.  The likelihood is that both Liverpool and City, perhaps with input from the FA, will look to offer free, or at least subsidised, coach travel for supporters wishing to travel. The clubs will look to work with supporters, and are acutely aware of their concerns. That, though, would only be kicking the can down the road. The wider question, surely, is how long will it be before fans are given the consideration they deserve from football’s governing bodies? See you at Wembley! pic.twitter.com/Fzhd58BYaq Wembley semi-finals happened sporadically during the 1990s – remember Chris Waddle’s free-kick for Sheffield Wednesday against Sheffield United in 1993, or Mark Hughes’ dramatic equaliser for Manchester United against Oldham a year later? – but they only became a staple after the new, redeveloped stadium was opened in 2007.  A financial decision, naturally, as the FA looked to recoup some of the costs of the rebuild. And while it has provided some memorable days out – for fans of Millwall, Barnsley, West Brom, Reading, Sheffield United, Hull and Wigan, for example – it is time the plans were reconsidered.  Forget money, think about people. Especially those who happen to live north of Watford. Supporters already have to put up with exorbitant ticket costs, overpriced merchandise and kick-off times chosen to suit TV audiences, why continue adding to their woes?   You might think that, having seen the game struggle on without fans for more than a year due to the pandemic, there might be a greater appetite from the governing bodies to make life a little more comfortable, a little more convenient for those who – and let's have this right – make the sport what it is: a noisy, colourful spectacle, filled with passion and emotion. So, if you're reading this, FA executives, then please take action. Wembley as a final venue? Absolutely fine, no problem. That’s the tradition, and it’s a good one. But as a semi-final host, it’s had its day.  This year’s farce should make that abundantly clear.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-man-city-fan-farce-wembley-dropped-fa-cup-semi/blt668aca2ec8be102a,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

7822,Welbeck makes honest Brighton reveal despite ex-Arsenal star enjoying new role,"Danny Welbeck is embracing his role as the teacher of Brighton's young forwards - but must wait and see if he will be offered a new deal.  The 33-year-old insists he has plenty of fuel left in the tank, but is out of contract this summer and the former Arsenal and Manchester United striker admits an extension is out of his control. Yet with Albion still on an upward trajectory, he is keen to extend his mentorship to the likes of Evan Ferguson, 19, and top scorer Joao Pedro, 22. âItâs not just down to me,â Welbeck said. âBut Iâm feeling good, feeling strong. Iâm always there for every single player that steps inside that dressing room to let them know what it means to play with this group. Iâm always there for everyone. âThereâs a lot of room for improvement, even though weâve had some wonderful seasons. âWe always want to get better. Thatâs down to the environment and culture within the team and squad. âEveryone wants to improve every single day. The manager, he doesnât let anyone rest on their laurels. Everyone is always on their toes, willing to get better and thatâs the right mindset to have.â With Joao Pedro out injured and Ferguson in a challenging run without a goal, Welbeck led the line away to Tottenham on Saturday. And after Pascal Gross put them in front from the penalty spot, the veteran forward was ""gutted"" that they came away with nothing having conceded to Brennan Johnson in the 96th minute. Manager Roberto de Zerbi watched from home after having dental surgery - although he was banned from the touchline anyway. ""Difficult to take. Everyone put a shift in but there were some smart details we didnât get right with the goals and itâs cost us. Itâs really, really hard to take,"" Welbeck said. ""We spoke to him via Facetime. Itâs difficult situation for him not to be here but we could see from the performance today that everyone did their jobs, we were all on it. ""It was disappointing not to have him here but we always know that heâs always with us in spirit wherever we go. Hopefully we can get him back soon. ""It looked like we might get the decisive goal at the end but with football youâve got to stay switched on at all moments. ""Last minute injury time, it was just small minor details that we didnât get right in maybe pressing or showing the defender one way, that can be the difference. They have amazing players in their team and can hurt you in an instant.

2602,Mane confirms he is happy at Liverpool after scoring the winner against Aston Villa,"Liverpool winger Sadio Mane has maintained he is currently happy with the team as they continue to push for trophies this season. The Reds continued their push to win the Premier League title when they came from a goal down to defeat Aston Villa 2-1 at Villa Park on Tuesday. Liverpool have already wrapped up the League Cup, are in the final of the FA Cup where they will face Chelsea, and are also in the final of the Champions League where they will come up against Real Madrid. It was Villa, who took an early lead courtesy of Douglas Luiz, minutes later Joel Matip put Liverpool level before the 30-year-old Senegal captain produced a brilliant header to complete the turnaround. After the game Mane was asked whether he has ever been happier at Liverpool, and he replied as quoted by the club’s official website:  “Yeah, sure – when we won the trophies I think I was more happy! “But I think I just try to enjoy every moment and try to score and assist for my teammates. I think it is all about the team or nothing; the boys make it easier for me so I am obviously very happy.” On his goal against Villa, Mane said: “Well, I think it was first of all a good cross from Luis [Diaz]. I was in the box and in this moment, I just think to put it in the net. Even without power, I think it’s usually a goal so that’s what I try to do.” It was Diaz’s cross which Mane headed in and when asked about his relationship with the player, he replied: “I know him very well. He is a great player, along with the other [front players]. We know each other, we train every day. I knew that he was going to cross so I was just going to be ready for it.” Despite reports linking Mane with a move away from Anfield, most recently Bayern Munich, Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher is confident the player will stay. “When I have watched Liverpool as a fan, Sadio Mane is my favourite player,” Carragher said as quoted by Sky Sports. “There is just something about Mane. He's sacrificed himself at times and the shift he puts in. “He, along with Salah, have been doing that for five years - they are never injured! They are there week in, week out for 90 minutes, getting the numbers up there every week. What they have done for this football club is unbelievable! ""I'm a huge fan of Sadio Mane and I can assure you he will be going nowhere because I will not let him go to Bayern Munich, he’d have me to deal with!” Carragher continued: “I love him, absolutely love him to bits. And not just because he's a great player and what he's done for Liverpool. He initially came in on the right-wing then moved to the left when Salah arrived. Diaz comes in on the left and Mane goes to centre-forward. “He’s always moving for someone else but his performances never drop. It doesn't seem to matter where Mane plays, you get exactly the same from him, the same cannot be said for the rest of the Liverpool attack.” Mane has netted 15 goals in this Premier League campaign, which ranks him joint fourth overall in this category, while also making him the second-top league scorer for his side. In addition, he has chipped in with two assists.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mane-confirms-he-is-happy-at-liverpool-after-scoring-the/bltf4a73ee919bb6f33,Dennis Mabuka,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6753,'Bonkers!' - Boris Johnson ridicules idea Russia could host Euro 2028 amid Ukraine invasion,"British prime minister Boris Johnson said it would be “beyond satire” for UEFA to seriously consider awarding Russia hosting rights for the 2028 European Championship. Russia is currently banned from international football competitions due to Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, but lodged a late bid for hosting rights regardless. As a result, Johnson believes that no amount of money would convince European football's governing body to side with the Russians. Speaking to LBC radio, the PM said: “I think it beyond satire that any football organisation - no matter how bonkers and driven by lucre they may be - would want to give Russia in the present circumstances the right to host a tournament. “It simply seems beyond comprehension. So I can't believe it's really a runner.” It was originally speculated that a joint bid from the UK and Ireland would run unopposed for hosting rights, but last-ditch bids from Russia and Turkey mean that is no longer the case. Now, English, Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish and Republic of Ireland's associations will have to work together to put forward the best possible argument for selection. It seems unlikely that Russia will be among the favourites, however, given the amount of sanctions the country finds itself under due to its ongoing conflict with its eastern neighbour. Turkey, meanwhile, will do their best to rival the UK/Ireland bid.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bonkers-boris-johnson-ridicules-russia-host-euro-2028/bltb6dc0d64aea381fe,Stephen Crawford,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11410,The Crisis Clubs: a Weekly Guide to Premier League Turmoil,"Each day on PL there is one main crisis club. The goal is to never be it In case you hadn’t noticed, each week the Premier League sees a specific team fall into crisis. Bad form, shock results, poor management, unforced errors; some or all of these factors can plunge one of the division’s beloved 20 sides into momentary turmoil, transforming them into the main character in Premier League narrative for that week. More often than not the crisis club will be a member of the Big Six but not always and, no matter who it is, the next set of fixtures will invariably throw up a new team to take up the crisis mantle, and the nation’s attention will pivot instantly to the league’s new whipping boys for the week. Here, then, is an ongoing guide to the Premier League’s crisis clubs in 2022-23.  This crisis correspondent was overseas following Kevin Lasagna last weekend so had to make do with periodic updates about how Chelsea were getting on against Arsenal. A simple glance at the scoreline might have suggested that this was a close run London derby, when it was actually a very dominant display from Mikel Arteta’s team, who restricted Graham Potter’s side to only five shots and 0.3 xG. That made it two defeats in a row in the league, after the embarrassing reversal at Brighton, so, heading into MD16 and a difficult assignment in Newcastle, Chelsea were facing up to three successive Premier League defeats for the first time since autumn 2015, when as reigning champions Jose Mourinho’s second spell in charge of the club imploded. The fact that Newcastle are going so well is an additional concern for Chelsea. Liverpool’s slow start to the season had eased open a top four spot but Newcastle’s form has essentially shut that off. The Analyst supercomputer now rates Eddie Howe’s team as 35.5% fifth favourites to finish in the Champions League places, with Manchester City, Arsenal, a recovering Liverpool and Tottenham ahead of the Magpies, in that order. Chelsea’s defeat at St James’ Park on Saturday evening was the first time since 2012 that they’d mustered less than 0.5 xG in consecutive Premier League games, and goalscoring remains the fiendish puzzle that Potter has to solve in the coming weeks. Chelsea’s total of 17 goals (and an associated goal difference of zero) is one fewer than promoted Bournemouth have scored, and one fewer than Erling Haaland too. Chelsea’s luring of the Brighton recruitment team to join Potter is certainly something to keep an eye on when the transfer window opens in January. Chelsea have recorded less than 0.5 xG in two consecutive PL games for the first time since March 2012 pic.twitter.com/qzPEPFNb2D No-one wanted to be the crisis club of MD16 because everyone knew it was the final matchweek before the World Cup break, so it’s a slow burn of a predicament, on in which Chelsea will spend six weeks being as close to the relegation zone as they are to the top four. The new regime at the club promised a patient approach and that’s exactly what it will take. Welcome back Liverpool, who are the Premier League’s crisis club for a fourth time this season. For a while on Saturday it looked like it would be Chelsea, who contrived to score two own goals in a Premier League game for the first time, and concede four goals to a team beginning with the letter ‘B’ for the second time in 2022, after only doing so once in the preceding 29 years. Graham Potter’s first defeat as Chelsea boss was drenched in narrative, could anything top it? Enter Liverpool FC. For the eighth time this season Jürgen Klopp’s team conceded the opening goal of the game, something only Southampton have done more often, and this one was sensational in its calamitousness, Joe Gomez spraying a no-look pass to where he thought Alisson might be operating, while the goalkeeper slipped and fell on the greasy turf. A Mohamed Salah goal brought Liverpool level with more than 75 minutes of the game left, but the home side managed only two more shots in the rest of the first half. The second half did bring elements of a Liverpool resurgence (16 shots, seven on target) but they met Illan Meslier in the sort of form that means he is only the second goalkeeper this season to make 9+ saves in a Premier League game, a performance which enabled Crysencio Summerville to  become the youngest visiting player to score a winning goal at Anfield in the Premier League since Wayne Rooney in January 2005. After recording more than 90 points in three of the last four seasons but only winning one league title, Liverpool are currently on course to get 51 this season. After 12 games they are 15 points behind Arsenal, a club they finished 23 points ahead of in 2021-22. Liverpool also have exactly the same record after a dozen games as they did in 2010-11, or “the Roy Hodgson season” as it’s more commonly known. Those aren’t good optics. Roy Hodgson's           Liverpool  Liverpool                    2022-23                           🤝                 P12 W4 D4 L4 No-one likes to admit it too much but luck plays a significant part in how a football season transpires. In 2019-20 Liverpool saw almost every edge scenario go in their favour, in 2022-23 the opposite is true. Quite obviously they aren’t playing as well as they used to, but they still could — and should — have beaten Leeds on Saturday. They didn’t, though, and the crisis is real. Now we wait and see what Napoli will do to this group of beleaguered players in midweek. A veritable smorgasbord of crisis options this weekend. Could it be two-steps-forward-one-step-back Liverpool FC, after their “is it August 1992?” 1-0 defeat away to Nottingham Forest. It was a less than ideal result for Jürgen Klopp’s team but with Chelsea and Manchester United drawing, and Tottenham losing, it’s not like they lost too much ground in what is looking like a low-quality chase for prime league table position. Less a crisis then, more a sense of pervading gloom. What about Spurs, who lost for the second game in a row, going down 2-1 at home to Newcastle in a result that sees Eddie Howe’s team climb into the top four and strike fear into Big Six™️ outcome analysts up and down the country. It’s been a bad week for Antonio Conte, but pure crisis? Not quite yet. OK, what about Leeds United, who haven’t won a Premier League game since they defeated Chelsea in August. The away fans turned on Jesse Marsch at Leicester in midweek and to follow that up with a home defeat to Fulham while sliding into the bottom three is… less than ideal. Yet Leeds, like Villa and Bournemouth before them, do have that option of changing the manager, which invariably results in an improvement of some kind. You know it, I know it, football club chairmen know it. Wolves 0-4 LeicesterWolves with 21 shots and no goals, Leicester with five shots and four goals. It's away day delight at last for the Foxes with Wolves now in deep trouble.#WOLLEI pic.twitter.com/nb7bkb3k43 No, the club with the purest energie-de-crisis right now are Wolverhampton Wanderers, a side who have already taken the decisive step of getting rid of their manager, Bruno Lage, but have found it impossible to replace him. Seasoned Wolves watchers will recall a very similar scenario in 2011-12, when the club sacked Mick McCarthy after losing heavily to West Brom, but were unable to secure a successor and ended up with McCarthy’s assistant, Terry Connor, in charge for the rest of the campaign. A decade on and the current Wolves team simply cannot score goals. Their total of five in 12 games works out as 16 across the entire season and, as it stands, the lowest number of goals ever recorded in an English top-flight season is 20, by Derby County 2007-08 (obviously) and Sheffield United in 2020-21.  Diego Costa is – who knew – not the player he was half a decade ago, and last season’s semi-cheat code, goalkeeper José Sá, has seen his significant overperformance from last season (8.7 goals prevented) regress hugely in the following campaign (minus-3.6 goals prevented). This sort of thing always catches up with you in the end and now Wolves, with caretaker boss Steve Davis facing up to a bleak winter, are left looking like they’ll need snookers to stay up. A rapid anti-crisis manoeuvre that saw them gallop to a 4-0 win against Brentford in the next game. Liverpool’s two week residency as the Premier League’s crisis club is over, and like European Cup hegenomy in the late 1970s, they have handed the crown on to Nottingham Forest. In a weekend where the only member of the Big Six to lose were Manchester City, and hardly in disgrace (playing a key role in yet another pulsating Liverpool vs. City narrative clasico does not a crisis make), we must look elsewhere in the storied prairies of the Premier League to find our incumbent. Some might suggest Aston Villa, with many if not most of the club’s fans rapidly losing patience with manager Steven Gerrard, but their 2-0 defeat to Chelsea on Sunday was unfortunate, the Villans coming up against the double whammy of Kepa Arrizabalaga in magisterial form and Mason Mount underlining his foundational importance to the Potterball project. It’s not shaping up to be a classic season for Villa but there are other teams in a worse position.  Like, say, Nottingham Forest. The side promoted through the play-offs and rebuilt with a fax machine over the summer had a huge game at Molineux on Saturday. Wolves, as an established Premier League club, were arguably in a gloomier position than Forest heading into this one, managerless and having scored three goals all season. No-one expected a classic and, to be fair, they weren’t disappointed. The game was a tale of two penalties, with Ruben Neves making one of his rare but ominous journeys into the opposition box to score one, and Brennan Johnson failing for Forest late on, after VAR had intervened. Wolves climbed out of the relegation zone, Forest slipped to the bottom after Leicester’s dour point against Palace earlier in the afternoon. 23 goals conceded after 10 games equals a Forest club record for the leakiest start to a top-flight season, matching the 23 they had let in at this stage in 1905.  Ruben Neves has had 38 touches in the opposition penalty area in his PL career. Six of them have been penalties. pic.twitter.com/yIyMrSePm9 But it’s not records from the sepia world of 1905 that Forest are worried about. There’s a certain set of numbers from 2007-08 that haunts the East Midlands soccer scene, namely Derby County’s record-destroying campaign that saw them end with only 11 points, one win, 20 goals scored and 89 conceded. Eleven points across 38 games is so bad it’s almost impossible to recreate — for instance see Sheffield United claiming two points from their first 17 games in 2020-21 but still ending the campaign on 23 points — but until Forest get past 11 this season their fans will have that nagging fear they might outdo their arch-rivals. After 10 games in 2007-08 Derby had scored fewer goals than Forest this season but had conceded one fewer and had one point more. With Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea all coming up in their next seven league games, Forest know now, if they didn’t before, that this season could be a long old grind. Avoiding defeat away at Brighton on Tuesday night, and preferably picking up all three points, takes on huge importance.  From this point in 2007-08 Derby took only one point from their next 13 games; surely Forest can do better than that? Liverpool unstylishly retain the crisis club position this week after a 3-2 defeat at Arsenal that leaves them 14 points behind the Gunners in the league and 13 behind Manchester City, who they face next weekend. True, Liverpool have a game in hand, but that’s away at Chelsea and do they look like a team who can handle that sort of assignment in their current state? A 2-0 home win against Rangers in the Champions League was a trial for a new, potentially season-rescuing 4-2-3-1 formation, but it turns out there’s a big difference between facing a Scottish Premiership outfit and a relentless, vivacious Arsenal team who keep being presented with major hurdles and keep jumping over them. The list of concerns for Liverpool is long and getting worse: Perhaps the starkest bit of information is that, in a development that will surprise absolutely no-one who has witnessed how Liverpool have begun games this season, Jürgen Klopp’s team would be bottom of the league if only the first halves of Premier League games counted. Yes of course, that’s not how football works, and Liverpool have shown brief glimpses of their famous powers of recovery this season, but even so, their ongoing ability to hobble themselves early on means their Crisis Club status is well earned, and – more ominously – may be hard to shake off, especially with Erling Haaland and company to face in MD11. It’s said that decline happens slowly and then all at once, and that’s very much the fear with Liverpool at the moment; they’ve had some huge games with Manchester City in the last decade but MD11’s encounter is shaping up as an epoch-defining game. Is this a frustrating blip or a permanent shift of power? We’ll find out soon enough.  A variety of options this week. Tottenham crashed to a 3-1 defeat at Arsenal, but they’ve only won one of their last 30 Premier League away games against their arch-rivals so this wasn’t a crisis moment, just a slide into despondency at the realisation that Arsenal might well be too legit to quit. Manchester United played their part in the highest-scoring Mancunian derby of all-time, losing 6-3 to the local and national champions Manchester City but Pep Guardiola’s team were once again parading human cheat code Erling Haaland and not many expected work-in-progress United to trouble City. They even won the second half 3-2. Wolves meanwhile, looked sullen and toothless in their defeat to West Ham but news came through on Sunday afternoon that the club had parted company with manager Bruno Lage. That’s not crisis swirling over Molineux, it’s renewed hope.  So that leaves Liverpool, who played out a 3-3 draw with Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday afternoon, a point that probably looked acceptable when they found themselves 2-0 down after 17 minutes, but felt like a defeat given they led 3-2 from the 63rd minute until Leandro Trossard’s hat-trick goal with seven minutes remaining. The draw — combined with other results this weekend — leaves Liverpool 11 points behind Arsenal and 10 behind perennial title rivals Manchester City (albeit with a game in hand on both) and, historically, any chance of a 20th league title is gone. The last team to have 10 points or fewer from their opening seven games but win the league were Liverpool themselves back in 1981-82, but that’s a footballing landscape that has long changed. It’s a marathon and a sprint these days. So while Liverpool now have to focus on finishing in the top four this season it’s giving the opposition great chances to finish that is repeatedly undermining the team. Brighton had six shots at Anfield this weekend; all of them were on target and all were recorded as clear-cut chances by Opta. Nervous Liverpool have given up more open play xG this season than struggling Wolves and Southampton so it’s clear where the issue lies. “The confidence level is not extraordinarily high,” Klopp said after the game. Sure, that’s the way of the crisis club. All six of Brighton's shots at Liverpool today were classed as clear cut chances, the highest 100% big chance rate since West Ham recorded 7/7 vs Newcastle in December 2018Quality >>> quantity pic.twitter.com/j1LotF6shS You may remember that Leicester won the Premier League in 2015-16 and had a decent run in the Champions League the following season. Always enjoy the good times because they’re only prologue to the bad times coming back and so far 2022-23 is looking like an absolute shocker of a campaign from Leicester. A somehow all-too-predictable 6-2 defeat to Tottenham in MD8 not only ensured the Foxes stayed rock bottom of the division but also saw them set a Premier League record for goals conceded in the first seven games of the season, posting the worst such record in the English top flight since 1965. Leicester are worse off than local rivals Derby County were at this stage in 2007-08, a season which set possibly unbreakable records for how bad a team could be. Are Leicester City going to get more than 11 points this season? Almost certainly. Does this stop them being MD8’s crisis club? Absolutely not. east midlands analysis:Derby 07-08 after 7 gamesgoals conceded: 20shots faced: 113shots on target faced: 42points: 4final points: 11Leicester 22-23 after 7 gamesgoals conceded: 22shots faced: 91shots on target faced: 41points: 1final points: ?? Arsenal will reach October having only dropped points in one league game all season, the 3-1 defeat to Manchester United in MD6. Clearly Arsenal are not a club in actual ongoing crisis this season – they are top of the Premier League and deservedly so – but it’s important to remember that you can bring crisis onto yourself by getting overly worked up about where a referee hails from and how cards are distributed across the league. Sometimes football is just an unfair low-scoring field invasion sport, sometimes you go an entire league season without defeat. If crisis club narrative proves anything it’s you have to take the rough with the smooth. Chelsea narrowly escaped official crisis club status in MD3 but in MD5 they could avoid it no longer. A dismal 2-1 defeat away at Southampton ensured that this would be only the second season this century that Chelsea had lost two of their opening five league games. The other occasion was back in 2015-16 when the club, reigning Premier League champions no less, showed no qualms in sacking their most successful ever manager for the second time. A week or so later, Thomas Tuchel would experience a similar sensation. There’s no hiding from the bleakly iridescent light that shines on each week’s crisis club in the Premier League. Avoid it at all costs. Romeo Lavia is the first player younger than Peep Show to score a PL goal For a while on the Saturday it looked like Manchester City – the reigning champions themselves – would sensationally become the Premier League’s new crisis club. Pep Guardiola’s team were 2-0 down at home to pests Crystal Palace after only 21 minutes and crisis-watchers cross the globe were preparing a series of takes and angles. But then Bernardo Silva pulled one back and Erling Haaland casually dropped a hat-trick in the space of 19 minutes. All of which meant that just as Liverpool had taken the crisis club mantle from their opponents in MD3, so they would hand it over to a Bournemouth team who came to Anfield and lost 9-0. Now, it’s relatively hard for a newly promoted club to be designated as a crisis club as no-one expects them to win too much, especially at venues like Anfield. But the sheer number of goals they let in (this is the third time in four Premier League seasons that a team based geographically near Peppa Pig World has lost 9-0) and the fact that the club themselves chose to dismiss manager Scott Parker in the aftermath of the defeat means that the crisis club mantle sat well with the Cherries that week. After two matchweeks cowering in the crisis cupboard, Manchester United enjoyed the sweetest passing of the baton possible as they defeated arch-rivals Liverpool to not only get some 2022-23 points on the board, but also to ensure that Jürgen Klopp’s winless Reds became the division’s new standard-bearers for momentary crisis. Liverpool conceded the opening goal of the game for the seventh Premier League match in a row, an unwanted club record, and once again left themselves with too much to do. It was the first time in a decade they had started a season without winning any of their opening three games. Sounds like crisis time to me, and it proved massively useful to Thomas Tuchel who had seen his Chelsea side get thumped 3-0 at Leeds on Saturday, giving them 48 hours of unwanted main character attention before Liverpool’s Monday night trip to Manchester. The heat was intense at the Brentford Community Stadium and so was the reaction to one of Manchester United’s worst ever league reversals. Erik ten Hag’s side looked utterly out of sorts as they fell to a 4-0 defeat, Brentford’s first win against them since 1938. It meant that Manchester United ended a day bottom of the Premier League for the first time since August 1992 and it was their fourth successive away defeat, the club’s worst run of that sort since 1979. If there’s a blueprint for what makes a crisis club in the Premier League then this was surely it. This is Manchester United Football Club we’re talking about. Early August seems like a long time ago. Graham Potter was still the Brighton & Hove Albion manager back then and the future Chelsea boss took his team to Old Trafford on the opening Sunday and guided them to their first ever away win against Manchester United, producing 12 first-half shots against their illustrious hosts in a superb display. In crisis club terms that put Manchester United straight into the hot seat that had been warmed by Liverpool for 24 hours (after they started their 2022-23 campaign with a nervous 2-2 draw at promoted Fulham). Erik ten Hag’s job had got off to the worst possible start, but surely a fresh crisis outfit would be along in a week’s time to take the pressure off the Dutchman? That’s how it works, right? Not always, Erik.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2022/11/2022-23-premier-league-crisis-clubs/,Duncan Alexander,14/11/2022 8:51,the-analyst
4968,Raphinha gives Barcelona 48 hours to sign him as Catalans match Chelsea's £60m transfer offer,"The end of the Raphinha transfer saga is in sight, with Barcelona having finally been able to match the bid that was made by Chelsea to sign the Brazil winger. The onus is now on Leeds United to negotiate with Barca, who are the club that Raphinha would prefer to join having agreed personal terms with them in May. Despite being less than stable when it comes to their finances, Barca have matched the £60 million ($72m) offer - including add-ons - that Leeds agreed with Chelsea last week. Arsenal, meanwhile, are all-but out of the race despite showing interest earlier in the transfer window. Barca headed into the summer with a debt of around €600m (£508m/$611m) to pay off, and though they have made some strides by selling off some of their television rights, they remain in a hole financially. They have been able to unveil new signings Franck Kessie and Andreas Christensen in the past days, but neither can yet be registered until more money is raised. Andreas Christensen presented as a Barcelona player ❤️💙 pic.twitter.com/s2MTk3Rut3 With that in mind, the offer they have made to Leeds would see them pay the fee in installments over a number of years, rather than all in one go. The initial fee they would agree to pay would also be lower than what Chelsea are offering, with more of Barca's bid made up of add-ons if certain achievements are met by Raphinha at Camp Nou. GOAL has learned that negotiations between Leeds and Barcelona have now accelerated following confirmation of the Spanish side's offer, and a solution is set to be found in the coming days. Raphinha wants to go to Barcelona but Leeds would prefer to sell to higher bidders Chelsea ⚖️ pic.twitter.com/G0r2v3M3HX Raphinha and his agent, Deco, have given the clubs just over 48 hours to hash out a deal, otherwise they will concede defeat and re-open talks with Chelsea over personal terms in a bid to seal a move to Stamford Bridge.

1696,No Afcon postponement despite deadly stadium stampede - Caf,"The Confederation of African Football have rejected suggestions that the Africa Cup of Nations should be cancelled or postponed in light of Monday’s deadly stadium stampede at the Stade d’Olembe which cost eight lives in the capital of Yaounde, and have insisted that the tournament can be a force for healing in Cameroon. A further 38 people were taken to hospital with injuries — seven in a critical state — during the Round of 16 meeting between the hosts and Comoros when a barrier collapsed and supporters were trampled by fans behind them attempting to enter the stadium. In light of the tragedy, Caf President Dr Patrice Motsepe has given some clarity on the circumstances surrounding the disaster, and outlined his belief that football can still have a positive impact in the Central African country. “The issue was whether we should postpone [Tuesday’s] matches, and it’s an important question,” he told journalists. “From my side, I cannot just consult, but also listen to the guidance of various stakeholders. “The conclusion was that we should observe a moment of silence, and with regards to [Tuesday’s] matches, it was an issue to discuss and consider. “However, it’s incredible how, even among those who are injured, two said to me that they can’t wait to get out of hospital and go to the stadium.  ""I’ve seen the passion, the absolute passion of the people of Cameroon and their love for football; it brings people together, and the passion for football in this country is entrenched and deep-rooted.” Motsepe explained how his own experiences of watching sport in a fractured South Africa — and South Africa’s 1995 rugby World Cup final victory — fuelled his conviction that continuing with the tournament would be the best for all parties. “I come from a country separated on race, where blacks could not play football with whites, and we always knew the power of sport, of football,” he continued. “I was in the stadium with my wife when [Nelson] Mandela was wearing the rugby captain’s jersey, and it had been the root of deep, deep division. “We’re all dealing with the pain we feel, but we have to deal with our obligations, and we have to be aware of the role football plays in bringing together people from all backgrounds across the continent.” While Motsepe revealed that Caf would hold a meeting with the Cameroonian Organising Committee on Wednesday to get more clarity on the circumstances surrounding the stadium disaster, he believed that a closed gate—reported as being the East Entrance of the arena—led to the loss of life. “There was a gate that was closed that was meant to be open, and if it had been open, people would have walked through,” he continued. “For inexplicable reasons, it was closed. “If it had been open, as it was supposed to, we wouldn’t have had the problem we have now—this loss of life. “As part of this hearing, we want to know who closed it and who is responsible, because we mustn’t compromise in our insistence to have appropriate measures which are the best in the world. “There may be unforeseen circumstances when a gate that is supposed to be open is closed, but we and our partners, we have a huge commitment to ensure that appropriate measures are put in place so that this doesn’t happen again.” Motsepe also confirmed that Sunday’s fixture which was scheduled for Olembe — between the winners of Egypt-Ivory Coast and the winners of Morocco-Malawi — would now be moved to Olembe. They also revealed that the 30 January meeting between the winners of Senegal-Cape Verde and the winners of Mali-Equatorial Guinea would be moved to Limbe from Douala.

11340,Qatar vs. Senegal: Prediction and Preview,"We preview the 2022 World Cup match between Qatar and Senegal, including our pre-match prediction for each team’s second game in Group A. You must allow functional cookies to continue. Senegal’s forwards need to step up in Sadio Mane’s absence if the Lions of Teranga are going to progress in the World Cup, says Aliou Cisse. Bayern Munich forward Mane was ruled out of the tournament after suffering a fibula injury. The former Liverpool star is Senegal’s talisman, and was crucial to their Africa Cup of Nations success earlier in 2022. In his absence, Senegal turned in a spirited display against the Netherlands in their opening Group A game on Monday, yet fell to a 2-0 defeat. This was despite mustering a higher expected goals (xG) total than their opponents (0.9 to 0.7) and having more shots (15 to 10). With hosts Qatar next up at Al Thumama Stadium, head coach Cisse has demanded more from his forwards, particularly Ismaila Sarr and Diatta. Cisse said: “We are disappointed, we had two or three very good chances [against the Netherlands]. “We needed to be more effective. Ismaila and Krepin are responsible there, but of course, the absence of Mane is a problem for us. Our attackers are good and we know what they are capable of. “We need to work on it, with Ismaila and the others. We expect a lot from him and Krepin.” Qatar also suffered a 2-0 defeat in their opening match, going down to Ecuador. They did not register a shot on target in that match. Since 1966, the only side to fail to land a single shot on target in consecutive World Cup games is the United States, doing so against the Czech Republic and Italy in the 2006 edition. “There’s no excuse, we want to congratulate our opponents, they deserved to win,” said coach Felix Sanchez. “There is a lot of room for improvement. Maybe the responsibility and nerves got the best of us. We didn’t start well. It was a terrible start.” Qatar failed to deliver in the tournament opener, but in Akram Afif they have a quality forward who could turn the game in their favour. Afif created only one chance against Ecuador, and Qatar need to find a way to get him into the game more this time out. Sarr had more shots (three) and created more chances (four) than any other Senegal player against the Netherlands, with the Watford attacker involved in 47% of their total attempts in the match (7/15). With his coach’s words no doubt ringing in his ears, Sarr will be determined to prove he can cut it in Mane’s absence. Senegal are the favourites for this one, according to Opta, who give the Africa Cup of Nations champions a 59.1% chance of victory. The draw is given a 24% chance, with the likelihood of a Qatar win only 16.9%.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2022/11/qatar-vs-senegal-prediction-and-preview/,Patric Ridge,25/11/2022 3:21,the-analyst

6747,"Biggest team in Manchester? United & City trophies, who has most fans & reputation explained","The Manchester derby is one of the most exciting games in English football, with United and City regularly producing memorable encounters as they bid to paint the town red or blue. Both clubs have long and proud histories of their own, with varying degrees of success enjoyed in the 20th and 21st centuries. Some of the most talented players in the world have graced their jerseys, while they each enjoy the support of famous faces thanks to their respective glories. But who is the biggest team in Manchester? GOAL takes a look at the trophy cabinets, the history, fan-bases and more to bring some clarity to a question that frequently occupies minds on either side of the city. Competition Man Utd Man City Premier League 20 7 FA Cup 12 6 League Cup 5 8 Community Shield 21 6 Champions League 3 0 Europa League 1 0 Cup Winners' Cup 1 1 UEFA Super Cup 1 0 Intercontinental Cup 1 0 Club World Cup 1 0 Total 66 28 Last updated: March 4, 2022 Manchester United boast a far greater trophy cabinet than Manchester City, with 66 pieces of silverware won by the Old Trafford club compared to 28 by their cross-town rivals. United have won the most Premier League titles (including First Division), with a record 20 league triumphs, whereas City are still in single figures with seven league titles. With 12 FA Cups, United boast twice as many as City, but the blue half of Manchester enjoys relative dominance in the League Cup, with eight trophies to United's six. United's domestic dominance is further encapsulated in their 21 Community Shields, with City claiming only six. City have yet to taste major success on the European stage and their sole continental triumph came in 1970 when they won the Cup Winners' Cup. United, by contrast, have won three Champions Leagues (including European Cup), the Europa League, the Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup. Manchester United enjoyed success in the 1950s and 1960s, with the height of their dominance coming during the Sir Alex Ferguson era, which spanned the 1990s up until 2013. Much of City's success, by contrast, has come since their 2008 takeover by the Abu Dhabi United Group, with a significant cash injection helping to boost the club's prospects on the pitch. The majority of City's league titles came after that, with five Premier Leagues adding to the two achieved in 1937 and 1968. Manchester United can safely claim to have the most fans out of the two main Manchester teams, having established a truly global brand thanks to the success achieved by Ferguson's teams in the 1990s and 2000s. United are recognised as one of the most valuable sports teams in the world by Forbes, with an appeal to football fans that is comparable to that of Clasico rivals Real Madrid and Barcelona. 🎶 ""Viva Ronaldo"" 🎶Man Utd fans certainly enjoyed Cristiano Ronaldo's 800th goal 🥳 pic.twitter.com/tCGYQt9F5X However, City are working hard to catch up and their recent era of dominance in the English game, ushered in by Pep Guardiola, has helped them broaden their appeal to supporters outside of England in a globalised market. While it is difficult to say with absolute certainty which team has the most fans, an examination of things such as social media following, stadium size and shirt sales can give an indication of comparative popularity. For example, as of March 2022, Manchester United's combined social media following (across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube) stood at 180.2 million followers. That is roughly twice as many as Man City, whose combined social media following stood at 91.4 million followers. Club Stadium Capacity Year built Manchester United Old Trafford 71,140 1909 Manchester City Etihad Stadium 53,400 2002 Manchester United have a bigger stadium than Manchester City, with Old Trafford's most recent expansion bringing its capacity to 74,140 seats. The City of Manchester Stadium (also known as the Etihad) is somewhat smaller, but it is still a major stadium with a capacity of 53,400. Of course, stadium capacity itself doesn't actually say much - it is the number of fans that fill that stadium which matters. Both teams regularly sell out games across all competitions, so their average attendance is very close to their full capacities. Manchester United can trace its foundation back to 1878, making the club two years older than Manchester City, which originated in 1880. However, it should be noted that both clubs were known by different names when they were first founded, so it is slightly complicated. Manchester United were founded in 1878 as Newton Heath and didn't officially become known as Manchester United until 1902. City, meanwhile, were founded as St Mark's (West Gorton) in 1880 before becoming Ardwick Association F.C. in 1887. They officially became Manchester City in April 1894 - eight years before United were officially 'Manchester United'. With more trophies won overall, a bigger stadium and greater global appeal historically, Manchester United can legitimately lay claim to being the biggest club in Manchester. For now, at least. However, just as empires rise they also fall and United's time in the sun has certainly diminished over the last decade or more, with City's success leaving their local rivals in the shade. Of course, City are in the process of building their legacy as one of England's great teams and it will take time before they can exhibit an honours list as lengthy as that of United, who some individuals regard as the biggest club not only in Manchester, but the world.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/biggest-team-manchester-united-city-trophies-most-fans/bltfd42a698fd114700,Ryan Kelly,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Sanusi scored in the fourth minute of time added on when he completed a swift counter-attack from Porto to ensure the Portuguese giants moved nine points clear at the top of the table.

With six minutes added on, the 24-year-old Super Eagles defender produced a neat finish when he met Pepe’s cross in the Benfica box for his third goal of the season which turned out to be the title-clincher. However, Sanusi had a quiet game as he won only two aerial duels while managing a 65 per cent pass completion rate, but he produced what Porto needed the most from his one shot. Democratic Republic of Congo defender Chancel Mbemba Mangulu, who played the entire game at the heart of the Porto defence alongside veteran Pepe, also celebrated the title win with a fine performance after managing a 96 per cent pass completion rate while winning one aerial duel. Meanwhile, Morocco international Adel Taarabt had a strong performance in the Benfica midfield but that was not enough to push his side to victory.

1471,Is Afcon 2021 heading towards a Salah vs Mane final?,"When was the last time the two best African players on the planet collided in the Africa Cup of Nations final? A case could be made, perhaps, for 2002, when El Hadji Diouf—reigning African Footballer of the Year—met Cameroon and a young Samuel Eto’o, who would win the award in 2003. Maybe 1980? When Segun Odegbami went toe to toe with Lakhdar Belloumi, although the likes of Thomas N’Kono and Jean Manga-Onguene would have something to say about that. Heading into the semi-finals here in Cameroon, however, a match between Africa’s top two is still firmly on the cards, with Senegal and Sadio Mane, and Egypt’s Mohamed Salah still very much on the cards. Some may argue that Riyad Mahrez has eclipsed Mane in recent years, and perhaps at times that’s been true, but as the reigning African Footballer of the Year, and with eight goals in the Premier League so far this season, the Senegal forward can still stake a strong claim to being second only to Salah in the current hierarchy of continental greats. Certainly, while Mahrez offered precious little before limping out of the competition in the group stage—missing a decisive penalty as Algeria were dumped out by the Ivory Coast—Mane is growing into the competition. He has netted twice and registered one assist so far, bagging in the narrow 1-0 victory over Zimbabwe to kick off Senegal’s campaign, before registering against Cape Verde in the Round of 16 only moments after sustaining a head injury. His and Senegal’s ascent to the final four has come as little surprise. While Ivory Coast, Algeria, Ghana and Nigeria have fallen by the wayside, Senegal have overcome every obstacle put in their path so far, even though it hasn’t been pretty. They negotiated their group stage without conceding a goal, but won just once—that 97th-minute winner against Zimbabwe—and were duly held 0-0 by both Guinea and Malawi. They similarly struggled to ignite against Cape Verde in the Second Round, before Mane broke the deadlock and Bamba Dieng finished off the contest later in the second half. Against Equatorial Guinea in the quarter-final, they may have conceded—and could have conceded more—but offensively, they started to tick, with the late arrival of Ismaila Sarr from Watford opening up the opposition defence as the Teranga Lions ran out 3-1 winners. During the group stage, two early kick-offs—they twice played in the sapping heat of 14h—could explain their sluggish start, and their improved performances in the knockouts give the whiff of champions. Despite conceding, a defensive containing the likes of Kalidou Koulibaly, Edouard Mendy, Bouna Sarr and Abdou Diallo is the strongest in the tournament, while the arrival of Sarr can open up Mane and give the Teranga Lions an extra dimension in attack. Senegal are certainly favourites to overcome Burkina Faso, fuelled by a desire to put a smile on the face of their embattled population back home, when the pair meet in Wednesday’s semi-final at the Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo, Yaounde. So, that would put Sadio Mane through to Sunday’s final at the Stade d’Olembe…but will it be Mohamed Salah who joins him from the other half of the draw? Egypt, unlike Senegal, weren’t consistently tipped for a strong showing in Cameroon ahead of the tournament, and fears that a lack of midfield creativity might limit them were realised during a stodgy group-stage showing and, particularly, their opening loss to Nigeria. While the Super Eagles were ultimately dumped out at the first sign of trouble, however, the Pharaohs rode out the storm and have progressed to the final four, while enduring the hardest knockout run of any of the sides still standing. While their semi-final opponents Cameroon had to dispatch minnows Comoros and Gambia, Egypt had to last the full 120 minutes against both Ivory Coast and Morocco before seeing off the former on penalties and their North African rivals thanks to Trezeguet’s extra-time goal. It doesn’t quite make them favourites—Cameroon have momentum behind them, the fuel of home support, and a plethora of attackers in hot form—but it demonstrates that Egypt, Africa’s masters of finding a way to win, have the kind of resourcefulness that few in the continent can match. Salah, like Mane, has sparkled intermittently at the tournament—and made some big contributions—without truly dominating games consistently. He generates more excitement among local supporters—at least until he’s due to come up against the hosts on Thursday—and both of the Liverpool stars have scored two and registered one assist so far this campaign. Salah just edges it, with his performance against Morocco—scoring the equaliser and then setting up Trezeguet’s winner—the kind of superstar showing that underpins his standing as Africa’s top player in the planet today. Both have lost in the final before, Mane in 2019 and Salah two years before, and both are clearly desperate to right the wrongs of Afcons gone by. The only question is: will they have to go through each other to do it?",https://www.goal.com/en/news/is-afcon-2021-heading-towards-a-salah-vs-mane-final/blt608b9eaf3e121d0a,Ed Dove,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5109,'We call Reyna Mr. Bean!' - Reus reveals Borussia Dortmund's hilarious nickname for USMNT star ,"Marco Reus has revealed that he and his Borussia Dortmund team-mates have adopted the nickname ""Mr. Bean"" for American star Giovanni Reyna. Reyna is set to return for Dortmund this weekend after missing five months with a hamstring injury. Ahead of Sunday's match against Bayer Leverkusen, Reus has spoken about Reyna's nickname and what he could potentially bring to Dortmund as they look to chase down Bayern Munich for the Bundesliga title. ""Mr. Bean. That’s what we call him because he – how can I put this – likes to waddle about,"" Reus told the Bundesliga website about Reyna. ""I hope he will have a lot more to offer us. He has been out for a really long time. It will still take a couple of weeks until he is back to his best but he offers more opportunities in deep, variation in terms of tactics.  ""We hope he stays healthy and can get fit quickly. With the run of midweek games coming up, we hope he can help us move forward.” Speaking in his pre-match press conference, Dortmund coach Marco Rose confirmed Reyna's return, saying: “Gio is back! Very cool! ""He really wants to be there, had another two good weeks of training. To see him back and to have his quality again is nice and important for us.” The 19-year-old's most recent match was back in September, when he suffered the injury while on international duty with the United States. He returns looking to help Dortmund to an unlikely late title charge, with Bayern looking to secure a 10th straight Bundesliga title. After defeating RB Leipzig on Saturday, Bayern have a nine-point lead over second-place Dortmund, who have a game in hand ahead of Sunday's clash with Leverkusen.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/reyna-mr-bean-reus-borussia-dortmund-hilarious-nickname/blt71b0e3712d070310,Seth Vertelney,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5459,Messi surprises former Man Utd youngster Angel Gomes with shirt swap request after PSG beat Lille 5-1,"Lille midfielder Angel Gomes was given a delightful surprise at the end of his side's defeat to Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday. Despite the Ligue 1 champions being thumped 5-1 by the current leaders, the 21-year-old was shocked to find Argentina legend Lionel Messi asking to swap shirts with him.

11323,Spain vs. Germany: Prediction and Preview,"We preview the 2022 World Cup match between Spain and Germany, including our pre-match prediction for each team’s second game in Group E. You must allow functional cookies to continue. After suffering a shock 2-1 defeat to Japan on matchday one, Germany could ideally do with a swift and straightforward response. Unfortunately for them, awaiting Die Nationalelf at Al Bayt Stadium on Sunday will be a Spain side that remarkably won 7-0 against Costa Rica last time out. Germany know defeat could doom them to a second successive group-stage elimination at the World Cup, an astonishing turn of events given that before 2018 they had not failed to get past the tournament’s first round since 1938. Another loss would consign Germany to three consecutive World Cup defeats for the first time ever – they have also never been beaten twice in the group stage of a single edition before. The pressure is already on head coach Hansi Flick, who suggested one of his main objectives before Sunday’s game is to ensure the team believes they can prevail. “The team and every person can always develop,” he said. “That’s why the team still has potential, which it’s not quite delivering at the moment. “Nevertheless, I believe we have good quality. Yes, we trust the team. We’re positive and just really want to see that we approach this game on Sunday against Spain positively. “It’s simply important to deal with defeats, but also to clear your head and focus on the new task, and that’s our goal, to get the team to the point where they naturally believe that they can push this thing in the right direction on Sunday.” Regardless of Germany’s belief, Flick’s side can at least take solace in the fact they pretty much know how Spain will play – Luis Enrique is never secretive about his expectations for La Roja. So. Many. Passes.🤯🤯🤯#FIFAWorldCup https://t.co/7uR8Amtg1Z pic.twitter.com/wyvb0j1D3N In their obliteration of Costa Rica, Spain recorded a possession figure of 81.9%, setting a new record since Opta have this data available in the World Cup (from 1966), surpassing Argentina’s 80.3% against Greece in 2010. That was Spain’s biggest ever World Cup victory and they also boast a strong recent record over Germany, having lost only one of their previous seven meetings. Granted, Spain have only won their first two games of a World Cup three times and not since 2006, but Luis Enrique was adamant after the Costa Rica win that complacency will not be an issue. This may be a young Spain squad, but they have long resembled an immensely unified unit under the guidance of Luis Enrique, who acts as a sort of pressure sponge, and Rodri believes their overall connection is their key strength. “It’s true we have been working very good for a long time, maybe on the results front,” he said. “Nowadays in football there is great equality, but the performance was there [against Costa Rica], and it was good. “The sensations were great, the team is whole in every line, defensively and offensively the team worked like an accordion. “The goals for me were a consequence of our play, and what I liked more about the other day is that we know that the collective is what will bring us success. “That is why everyone was remarkable, everyone had a great contribution, and everyone respected his position and his role.”  He was withdrawn before the hour mark against Costa Rica, but that was more than enough time to show just how integral Pedri is to how Spain play. He completed 97% of his passes (86/89), but what made that even more impressive was the fact he was the fulcrum of La Roja’s attacking play, with only Dani Olmo (33) attempting more passes in the final third than him (30). Managing to maintain that accuracy in such a congested area of the pitch where he was expected to take risks was mightily impressive, and he even managed to tally a joint-high three key passes. Germany would be wise to pay him special attention. The defeat to Japan was a game to forget for Germany, but Gnabry did at least look lively. He managed six shots on matchday one, with three of them on target, and was very involved. In fact, he played a part in 12 open-play sequences that ended a shot, with Kylian Mbappe (13) the only player to better him in that regard over the first round of matches at the tournament. He will need to do better in front of goal, but he clearly has the capacity to cause Spain problems. There is every chance this will be close. Spain go into the game as the favourites with a 42.7% chance of success, according to our prediction model, but this means there is a 57.3% likelihood of them failing to win. That incorporates Germany’s 31.9% probability of emerging victorious, which also highlights how difficult this game is to call from the outset.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2022/11/spain-vs-germany-prediction-and-preview/,Devs Someoddpilot,27/11/2022 2:55,the-analyst
9524,Joan Laporta's stance on appointing Jurgen Klopp as Barca coach revealed,"Barcelona president Joan Laporta likes Jurgen Klopp and would happily appoint him as Barca coach if he could, Diario Sport say. Laporta has always admired German managers for their deep understanding of football and ability to adapt anywhere. Thus, Laporta wanted to bring Klopp to Barca when Ronald Koeman got the axe in 2021 but he shelved the idea as Klopp was firmly seated as Liverpool boss.However, there's an opportunity to get Klopp now after he shocked Liverpool and their fans by announcing he will leave the club at the end of the season. The 56-year-old manager cited a lack of energy and exhaustion as his reason for leaving Liverpool. Pep Guardiola said almost the same thing when leaving Barca in 2012.  Klopp did not rule out a return to management when he leaves Anfield but says he will only manage a club outside England if he were to do so. Barcelona are currently coached by Xavi whose future on the job seems ever so uncertain as the club cannot maintain consistency. This season, Barcelona have been knocked out of the Cup and failed to win the Spanish Supercopa. Xavi's hope of saving his job now lies in Barca's performance in La Liga and the Champions League.

7509,"Schumacher's favourite restaurant: Cristiano Ronaldo, Haaland have visited!","The worldâs best pasta maker is eating her lunch.  After a busy morning service, Rossella Giannini enjoys the silence. The silver-haired matriarch watches closely as her husband, Maurizio, divides the remaining contents of a large pan of ragu between himself, their son, Alberto, and daughter-in-law, Francesca, the family of four exchanging few words while waiters diligently prepare for the evening to come. It is rarely this quiet at Ristorante Montana. Situated a stoneâs throw from Maranello, the home of Ferrari, Rossella has fought an uphill battle to compete with the five-star hospitality on offer down the road, where men in suits pay a premium for a slice of Italian luxury. Yet the stars, it seems, gravitate here. It was Erling Haaland who, sat within these four wood-panelled walls, wrote âthe best pasta Iâve ever eatenâ on a napkin addressed to Rossella. âMino Raiolaâs father was a friend,â explains Maurizio, the footballing super-agent having recommended this hidden gem to the free-scoring Manchester City star before his death in 2022.    Haaland is one of countless footballing faces to make the trek to Ristorante Montana. Roberto de Zerbi, Gianluca Scamacca and even Cristiano Ronaldo have paid Rossella a visit - the famously diet-crazy Portuguese unable to resist Rossella's hearty cooking during a visit with former Juventus president Andre Agnelli some years ago. 'He ate fried dumplings with cured meats and pasta - lasagna, tortellini and gramigna - plus tiramisu for dessert,' Rossella recalls. She has admirers in Hollywood too, with actress Penelope Cruz and director Michael Mann sampling her famous pasta. But it is the drivers from La Scuderia who have made this place their home. RenÃ¨ Arnoux and Stephan Johansson were first to walk through her doors in 1986 while Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, the two men competing for the Prancing Horse this year, are regular visitors. Sebastian Vettel still pops in despite leaving the team in 2020 while a framed photo of a grinning Fernando Alonso hugging the Italian chef during his formative racing years is proudly displayed alongside photos of his fellow Ferrari alumni. There is one picture that inspires the most awe among this myriad of memorabilia, though. Stretched across the width of the wall, Rossella squeezes Michael Schumacher as he tucks into one of her staple dishes - tagliatelle with pork ragu sauce. 'To my mama Rossella,' reads the German's message, delicately-penned in Italian on the canvas. 'Thank you for everything.' Rossella looks on with a smile, her soft eyes aglow with admiration for the man who made it his mission to visit whenever in Maranello.     'Breakfast, lunch and dinner he would come here,' she tells Mail Sport as she clears the table. 'He was everything,' Rossella remembers her first meeting with Schumacher well. Acquainting himself with the local area after signing for Ferrari, the German arrived on her doorstep late at night. 'It was February 14, 1996 at 11.30 pm,â she recalls. âHe landed in Parma with his private plane and came to us with the press officer at the time, Mr. Claudio Berro. He had dinner on Valentine's Day evening. It was love at first sight!â Five world championships and many tagliatele dishes later, Schumacher has left an indelible mark on Maranello, as well as Rossella's heart. 'He called me his Italian mama and he was like another son to me,' she says with a smile, cherishing those unforgettable moments. It's been over ten years since Schumacher last visited Ristorante Montana, the German the victim of a shocking skiing accident on the French Alps in December 2013. His wellbeing has largely been kept from his adoring fans and he has not been seen in public since. Francesca, standing underneath a framed Schumacher racing suit nearby, utters: 'It's a tragedy.' But the Schumacher clan haven't forgotten about the woman who cared so deeply for Michael. While visits are few and far between since his son, Mick, left Ferrari's young driver programme, a trio of racing helmets belonging to the pair are perched on a shelf above the cash register. 'Mick and his mother visited last year,' Francesca says, before showing a photo of the young driver giving Rossella a warm hug. The connection still runs deep between the families after all of these years. The wheels keep on turning at Ristorante Montana on this grey February afternoon, where another successful night's trading fast approaches. Will a famous face pay a surprise visit this evening? Leclerc is in town to promote Ferrari's new partnership with Peroni, while a fever-pitch excitement is in the air over Lewis Hamilton 's upcoming arrival - the Briton having signed a lucrative deal to join the Scuderia from 2025.  The seven-time world champion has never frequented this Ferrari sanctuary but his father, Anthony, dropped by many years ago, long before Hamilton begun talks with the Italians over a shock switch from Mercedes. The follower of a strict vegan diet, will Rossella's famous tagliatelli be off the menu for Hamilton? 'I'm the boss here!' Rossella quips, excited at the prospect of cooking for the man desperately chasing a record-breaking eighth world title - a tally which will see him finally eclipse her darling Schumacher. 'He will have what I cook for him!' If he's anything like his fellow stars, Hamilton won't be able to escape the magic of this refuge. And the secret ingredient to Ristorante Montana's success? .

5398,'Why did you go and get him?' - Belgium assistant coach Henry questions Chelsea decision to sign £98m Lukaku,"Thierry Henry has questioned Chelsea's decision to sign Romelu Lukaku after seeing him dropped for the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Lille. Lukaku returned to Chelsea for a second spell at the club last summer, with the west London outfit paying a club-record fee of £98 million ($133m) to re-sign the forward from Inter. The 28-year-old has since struggled to live up to that price tag, and produced his worst performance of the season in the Blues' 1-0 win at Crystal Palace at the weekend as he only managed seven touches of the ball in 90 minutes. Tuchel took the decision to rest Lukaku for his side's 2-0 win against Lille in the first leg of their Champions League knockout stage tie, with Kai Havertz scoring the opener after being tasked with leading the line instead of the Belgian. It has been suggested that Havertz could retain his spot when Chelsea play Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on Sunday, and Henry is not sure where Lukaku goes from here. The Arsenal legend, who helps coach the striker at international level, told CBS Sports: “Right from the start I raised a question to myself, would he fit into this team? For Rom to adapt to the way Chelsea play, it takes time, it’s not an easy one. “Is it normal that he only has seven touches [against Palace]? No, that’s also not normal, regardless of if the coach likes you or not. That shouldn’t happen. “They need to move forward on that but it’s a tough one to read. I’ll be honest with you, I don’t know how that happens in 90 minutes. But what’s the solution? “The solution is for him to find a solution to make sure he can adapt to the way they play. “They like to press, to be active and to change the front three. He likes to stay in the middle so it makes it very difficult for him to adapt to the situation. “But, again, why did you go and get him?” Lukaku said it was a ""dream"" for him to re-join Chelsea and that he had unfinished business at the club after his first stint on their books between 2011 and 2014. The former Inter frontman, who has also previously played in the Premier League at Everton and Manchester United, committed to a five-year contract at Stamford Bridge but questions are already being asked over his future due to his inconsistent form. Lukaku has hit a modest total of 10 goals in 28 appearances in all competitions so far this term, and risked the wrath of supporters when he admitted that he never wanted to leave San Siro in an ill-advised interview with the Italian media in December. ""If there had been the offer of a new contract from Inter last summer as I wanted... we would not be doing this interview from London, but quietly from Milano!"" he said to Sky Italia. Lukaku also claimed that Chelsea wasn't his first-choice next destination, adding: ""There are three teams at the top level: Barcelona, Real, Bayern. All the players dream of them, that's the truth. I thought I was going to one of those clubs after Inter. ""This didn’t happen and I said: there is only one club where I can imagine myself, it's Chelsea.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/henry-questions-chelsea-decision-sign-gbp98m-lukaku/bltc055041e279a98e7,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5147,When did Arsenal last qualify for the Champions League?,"There was a time when Champions League competition without Arsenal being involved was almost unimaginable, with Arsene Wenger making the Gunners regular guests at European football’s top table. Between 1998 and 2017, the legendary French coach delivered a record-setting run of 19 successive qualifications for elite continental competition – with the north London heavyweights making their way to a first final in 2006. Wheels started to come off, though, towards the end of Wenger’s tenure and Arsenal have been unable to put them back on since. How long has it been since a Champions League finish was last secured? GOAL takes a look… Prior to their qualification for the 2023-24 Champions League, Arsenal's previous involvement in the competition came in 2016-17, meaning they went six years without competing in UEFA's top-tier club tournament. Qualification for the 2023-24 edition of the Champions League was secured after the Gunners finished second in the 2022-23 Premier League. Before that, Arsenal had been marooned in the Europa League, having failed to finish in the top four. While Mikel Arteta has had to be patient, it did not take Wenger long to make an impact in English football following his appointment as Arsenal manager in October 1996. He guided the Gunners to Premier League title glory in 1997-98, while also landing the FA Cup as part of a domestic double, and a Champions League bow was made in the following campaign. Group-stage exits were endured in each of Arsenal’s first two outings at that level, before reaching the quarter-finals in 2000-01. A place in the last eight was secured again in 2003-04, before suffering final heartache in a 2-1 defeat to Barcelona at Parc des Princes in 2006. 🟡 Campbell 37’🔵🔴 Eto’o 76’🔵🔴 Belletti 80’#OnThisDay in 2006, Barcelona came from behind to beat Arsenal and win the Champions League 🏆pic.twitter.com/IujZUe2mEJ Wenger oversaw runs to two quarter-finals and one semi-final between 2008 and 2010, but Champions League adventures came to a close with a sequence of seven successive defeats in the last 16. The most recent of those came at the hands of Bayern Munich in 2016-17, with back-to-back 5-1 defeats to the German giants delivering painful last memories for the Gunners among the European elite. They could only muster a fifth-place finish in the Premier League that season and did not manage a top-four finish until 2022-23, when they finished second to Manchester City.

Indeed, one look at the starting line-up for Klopp's first match, at Tottenham on October 17, 2015, shows just how far Liverpool have come since his arrival at Anfield. With his tenure as Red boss concluding at the end of the 2023-24 season, GOAL looks back at which players featured in that 0-0 draw in north London, and where they are they now.",https://www.goal.com/en/lists/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-manager-debut-players/blt1e5b92466edbb556,Ritabrata Banerjee,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2648,Dembele's contract extension talks with Barcelona collapse,"Ousmane Dembele could be set to leave Barcelona this summer after contract extension talks with the club collapsed this week, GOAL can confirm. Negotiations did not go as the Blaugrana expected and Dembele's contract requests were not met. The sides remain a long way apart in their wage proposals. However, Xavi and Co. remain hopeful that a deal can be salvaged despite the dire circumstances. Dembele's current contract ends after this campaign, and he is free to negotiate a pre-contract with other clubs starting on January 1. The hope had been for Barcelona to reach an agreement with the French winger before that date, but this week's talks crumbled when Dembele balked at the wage cut the Blaugrana demanded. Both his wages and a bonus for his agent are points of contention. Barca manager Xavi has said that he wants Dembele to be a key part of his rebuild at the club, recently stating: ""We are going to be positive for him to renew, for me it is fundamental.""  However, that positivity is now waning. Barcelona believe it's imperative to slash Dembele's wages in order to help afford the registration of new signing Ferran Torres, who cannot be officially added to their La Liga squad under current financial circumstances.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/dembele-extension-talks-with-barcelona-crumble/blt24c3401e13999c7d,Adrià Soldevila,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4387,Barcelona respond to reports of meeting Lewandowski's agent to discuss transfer for Bayern Munich striker,"Barcelona director Mateu Alemany has denied reports the club has held a meeting with Robert Lewandowski’s agent over a summer transfer. The Bayern Munich striker has been linked with a move away from the Bavarian giants as he considers a new challenge in his career at the age of 33. Barca were tipped as a possible destination, but suggestions that talks have already taken place have been dismissed. Asked by Movistar about the rumours. Alemany said: “There was no meeting with Lewandowski’s agent. Also, I don't like to speak about the negotiations process - it's something private. ""We don’t like to discuss players who are under contract with other clubs"". Bayern Munich have publicly stated their desire to agree a new contract with Lewandowski, who has hit 49 goals this season to help Bayern lift a 10th straight Bundesliga title. However, GOAL has previously been able to confirm that contingency plans are being pieced together in Bavaria when it comes to lining up possible replacements for the record-breaking frontman. Alemany also gave an update on the progress of new contracts for Gavi and Ousmane Dembele. Dembele’s current deal expires this summer while teenage wonderkid Gavi is out of contract next year. “They [contract talks] are long processes, it is not easy,” he told Barca TV. “We have set a salary bar and proportionality is very strict. The financial situation we have inherited is very delicate and it is not easy to find a point of balance. ""We hope to be able to close it as soon as possible and they can continue here for many years.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-respond-reports-meeting-lewandowski-agent-transfer/blte9cb688ac90ec7da,Tom Mallows,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2081,Explained: Why Conor Gallagher is not playing for Crystal Palace vs Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final,"The FA Cup semi-final between Chelsea and Crystal Palace is sure to be a special occasion as the London rivals duke it out for a place in the final and a shot at silverware. Palace, however, must make do without one of their best players this season, Conor Gallagher, much to the chagrin of head coach Patrick Vieira. ""He has played all the games so far,"" reflected the former Arsenal midfielder. ""And if there’s somebody who deserves to be in the semi-final, it’s him because of his performances, so I’m disappointed he won’t be able to play."" So what is the rule that prohibits Gallagher from playing on this occasion? GOAL brings you everything you need to know. Gallagher is not permitted to play for Palace against Chelsea due to a clause in his loan agreement which does not allow him to take part in fixtures against his parent club. He had featured in the Eagles' previous FA Cup fixtures against Millwall, Hartlepool United, Stoke City and Everton. However, he will have to watch on from the stands as Vieira's side make a push for the final. Such clauses are common in football loan transfers and Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, who has steered the Blues to Champions League glory, was adamant that he is not in the business of helping his opponents. Nevertheless, the German coach expressed understanding, noting that he said sorry to Gallagher. Conor Gallagher has caught Thomas Tuchel's attention 👀With plenty of competition at Chelsea, what's the next step? 🧐✍️ @NizaarKinsella ""I had the chance to speak to Conor, I could also see his frustration. We met some weeks ago, after the national break by coincidence. We ran into each other in a restaurant and we had a chat,"" Tuchel told reporters ahead of the semi-final. ""The subject came up, I apologised because I know how competitive he is and I like him a lot, I know his character very well and was a pleasure to have him here in pre-season. ""This is the way it is. We play to win the game and the rules were clear when we made the loan. ""I can totally understand Patrick Vieira and the disappointment of Conor but these are the rules when we did the loan and we don’t want to suffer from our rules.""

Prior to the semi-final against Chelsea, he had scored eight goals and provided two assists in the Premier League across 27 appearances in the competition. His work rate has been a particular asset for the Eagles and he notably broke a club record for distance covered in a single game when Palace drew 0-0 against Manchester City in March 2022. Chelsea and Crystal Palace play in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday April 17. The game will kick off at 4:30pm BST (11:30am ET).

3294,Werner pens goodbye letter to Chelsea as striker seals RB Leipzig transfer,"Timo Werner has said goodbye to Chelsea's fans as he re-joins his former club RB Leipzig. Werner had originally joined the Blues from RB Leipzig in 2020 after Chelsea activated his £45 million ($54m) release clause, but will now head back to Germany for a reported transfer fee of €30m (£25m/$31m). Werner struggled to reach the heights at Stamford Bridge that he did reach in Germany, although he did claim a Champions League winners medal during his Chelsea stint. He'll now head back to Germany and, as he leaves the Premier League, Werner penned a goodbye letter to Blues supporters. ""Today marks the end of my journey with Chelsea FC,"" he said in a letter posted on social media. ""I am incredibly grateful for the time I spent at this special club. At this point I would like to express my appreciation for my teammates, the coaches and staff, and especially for you, the supporters of Chelsea Football Club. ""I felt so much love and support throughout the last two years and I will never forget how you guys stood behind me in good and in challenging times! ""We lifted trophies like the Champions League together and I will always remember the song you wrote and chanted for me. I'm already looking forward to hopefully playing at Stamford Bridge again one day!"" 👋 @ChelseaFC pic.twitter.com/ak5cSXiqbR Werner managed to score just 23 times in 89 appearances across all competitions for Chelsea, although he did help the club win that Champions League medal.

3103,"Who will host Euro 2028? England, Spain, Greece and potential bids","Euro 2028 might still be a few years away, but the road to the competition will be exciting as ever – including discovering who will get to host the tournament. Getting to host a major tournament like the Euros is an exciting and ambitious honour, as match-goers are treated to not only the experience of watching the games, but also experiencing the culture of the host country. So where could Euro 2028 be held, and what countries have announced their hosting plans? GOAL takes a look. The United Kingdom and Ireland announced their plans to bid to host Euro 2028 in February, while also confirming plans to scrap their bid to host World Cup 2030. This means that England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and Republic of Ireland are proposing a joint bid. They said in a statement: ""Following an extensive feasibility study, which assessed the potential opportunities in international football, the football associations of the Republic of Ireland, England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have agreed to focus on a bid to host UEFA Euro 2028, the third-largest sports event in the world.  ""The feasibility study included an analysis of the economic impact, the political football landscape and likely costs of hosting major international tournaments. On balance, the five associations have decided to focus solely on an official bid to host UEFA Euro 2028, and have agreed not to bid for the 2030 FIFA World Cup."" Romania, Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia announced their plans for a joint bid in February 2019, for both Euro 2028 and World Cup 2030. Turkey announced their bid to host Euro 2028 in August 2019, having bid unsuccessfully to host the tournament five times in previous years: in 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020 and 2024. The host – or hosts – of Euro 2028 will be announced on September 2023. It is not currently known if multiple host countries will automatically qualify for Euro 2028 if they are awarded the bid. The United States, Mexico and Canada successfully bid to host World Cup 2026 but FIFA have not yet confirmed the qualification process for the tournament. It is also possible that all three countries would qualify for the tournament through the regular process. The FIFA Council is expected to decide which hosts, if any, will receive a direct path of qualification to the tournament. The 2002 World Cup hosted by Japan and South Korea was the last time that a tournament's hosts did not have to play qualification matches, as they qualified automatically as hosts.

Mourinho was sacked shortly after and his replacement, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, didn't fancy Dalot much. Ole preferred playing Aaron Wan-Bissaka instead at right-back. However, since Ole's departure, managers Ralf Rangnick and now Erik ten Hag have both opted to play Dalot over Wan-Bissaka.

5317,"Roman Weidenfeller: Gentleman, leader, ambassador - one of Borussia Dortmund's undisputed greats","Roman Weidenfeller is one of the undisputed greats of Borussia Dortmund. Standing at six foot three inches, Weidenfeller was renowned for his consistency, leadership and his quick reflexes. Weidenfeller built a phenomenal career with BVB, winning two Bundesliga titles, two DFB-Pokals and reaching a Champions League final in 2013 in the process. The former Germany international also has a FIFA World Cup medal to show during his stay with the Black and Yellows, having been part of Germany’s World Cup winning side in 2014. A born leader, a fantastic goalkeeper and a nice guy to boot, Weidenfeller did it all and saw it all with Dortmund. Weidenfeller is widely regarded as one of the most important players in Dortmund’s history, being there through some lows and notorious highs, especially during Jurgen Klopp’s heyday in the early 2010s - and his connection with BVB, its supporters and the whole culture of the club as a whole is ever-present, as you can tell by his thoughts on the current season. “This season has been a bit complicated,” Weidenfeller said in an exclusive interview with GOAL.  “The Bundesliga is in a weird place. Twelve points behind Bayern Munich, but five points in front of Leverkusen, so it is positive that we are staying in the Champions League, but it is also negative because we’re not so close to Bayern Munich,” he added.  Much like Weidenfeller has said, it’s been a topsy-turvy season for BVB thus far. While they have been stable in the Bundesliga, constantly in the places to qualify for next season’s Champions League. But that doesn’t stop the former shot-stopper from having his own favourite moments in the season. “It’s not easy to pick one this season. Maybe one of my favourite moments of this season was the game against [Borussia] Monchengladbach at Dortmund, which we won 6-0. “But the highlight of the season is the fans coming back to the stadium. This is the biggest highlight of the season. First time in two years that the Signal Iduna Park was sold out, so I’m very happy for the people and that they can come to the stadium and celebrate together. It’s one of those fantastic moments of this year,” he explained.  Developing talent has always been a major theme at BVB, and it is no different this year. The club is constantly trying to search and sign some of the most promising youngsters in football and give them a platform where they can grow, develop and evolve as a whole. It is a system that has proven to be quite beneficial and profitable for Dortmund and, according to Weidenfeller himself, would continue that way in the coming months. “We now bought Niklas Sule (from Bayern Munich) in defence as well as Nico Schlotterbeck. And then we would like to check the situation with [Karim] Adeyemi and perhaps we can do something with a couple of other players as well. “But the focus in the last few weeks was with the youth team because they had some really good performances. They scored a great goal in the  game against Wolfsburg. Tom Rohte and Jamie Bynoe-Gittens have been exceptional.”  One of the strongest elements of Borussia Dortmund as a football club is their relationship with the fans and this is shown time and time again at the Signal Iduna Park, with the Yellow Wall and the intense support they get every single game. And considering their efforts to branch out to the Asian market with the documentary series ‘Who We Are’, it is clear that Asia is a priority for Dortmund. “We have a lot of means to engage with fans via social media so we are active with the people in Asia, and hopefully, we can keep in contact with the fans over there.” “Every time we go visit Asia, it is amazing to see so many people enjoying football played in Germany and the Bundesliga, especially because a lot of them support Borussia Dortmund. I think we are a really big brand in Asia and, for me, this is wonderful and good to see.” Having claimed almost every accolade possible in Germany throughout his career, it was interesting to hear his thoughts on the best ways to reach the very top. “Work for your dream and work hard. Work every day to get the best out of your performance and be a little bit stronger to be better every day. As for goalkeeping advice, the most important thing is that the ball doesn’t go in. That’s the most important part of a goalkeeper’s job. And then, of course, it’s the technique, it’s the feet, playing in service to the defence while you’re behind them.” The German keeper has become a symbol of the club’s resurgence in the last decade or so and part of that was not only his outstanding quality in his role but also his leadership, to the point that he became the club’s captain and remained in that position until his retirement in 2018. So it’s quite obvious that he has seen and lived a lot of great moments at the Signal Iduna Park stadium. Moments such as becoming the club’s captain on the pitch during the title-winning season in 2010/11 or saving Arjen Robben’s penalty to retain said title in 2011/12 are just a handful of occasions where Weidenfeller displayed his leadership and quality to help BVB to be successful after years of struggle. And his love for the supporters is ever-lasting. “For me, it was the stadium. It was the most beautiful stadium I ever played in. It was always noisy and we always had the 12th man behind us, and for me, it was always a very fantastic feeling to play there.” “As for my favourite trophy, I won two championships, two DFB Pokals and that final in the Champions League against Bayern Munich. And all those matches against Real Madrid or against Malaga were such wonderful times and feelings as well.” Winning the World Cup is definitely every player’s dream and Weidenfeller got to experience just that in 2014, fulfilling a key moment in his career. When quizzed on his favourite moment with his national team, it didn’t take long for Weidenfeller to state the obvious.  “My dream came true when we won the World Cup. I was really nervous to win this cup, I had a chance to win it and it was fantastic. It was one of the best days of my life.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/roman-weidenfeller-gentleman-leader-ambassador-one-of/blt2d05faf4d2b87925,Sohail Shamsudeen,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

4616,Pogba set to complete Juventus return on free transfer after Man Utd exit,"Paul Pogba is poised to complete a return to Juventus as a free agent, GOAL can confirm, with the World Cup winner preparing to retrace his steps to Turin after reaching the end of his contract at Manchester United. The 29-year-old midfielder spent four years with the Bianconeri between 2012 and 2016, with his profile enhanced in Italy to the point that a world record transfer fee of £89 million (£112m) was required in order to take him back to Old Trafford for a second stint in England. He is now ready to head back to familiar surroundings in Serie A, with final confirmation of the deal now expected next month. Once it became apparent that Pogba would be severing ties with United, as no extension was going to be agreed, a number of clubs expressed interest in acquiring his services. Some of those have attempted to pip Juve to a prized signature, but the Italian heavyweights have fended off rival advances in order to put an agreement in place. It is understood that Pogba will now commit to a three-year deal through to 2025, with those terms worth around €7.5m-per-season (£6m/$8m). Juventus are confident in signing Paul Pogba on a free transfer 📝 pic.twitter.com/3SRd5k5WQ1 The France international has given his word to the Bianconeri that he will be rejoining their ranks and will not be having any late change of heart. He is confident that the right career call is being made, with close family and friends having been informed of a decision that is now set in stone. GOAL understands that Juve are extremely confident about sealing a free transfer for the France international and that they believe they have done all that is necessary to bring him back. While official confirmation may still take some time, perhaps up to the start of July, the club has received reassurance from the Pogba camp that he is Turin-bound.  Pogba enjoyed his previous stint with Juve, as he claimed four successive Serie A titles, and wants to build on a record in Turin which previously saw him register 34 goals through 178 appearances. Massimiliano Allegri has brought the best out of him before, with a highly-rated tactician having first filled a demanding managerial role back in 2014, and the pair are now ready to be reunited. Juve’s boss has pushed hard for Pogba to be brought in, as Juve look to bounce back from two fourth-place finishes, and the Bianconeri board are ready to deliver a marquee addition. Things did not work out as planned for the mercurial Frenchman at United, despite winning three trophies in his first season back in Manchester, and he will be eager to rediscover a spark with another fiercely ambitious outfit.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/pogba-juventus-return-free-transfer-man-utd-exit/blte951f86da1de5458,Romeo Agresti,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10341,Luton vs Arsenal: Prediction and Preview,"We look ahead to Tuesday night’s Premier League action at Kenilworth Road with our Luton vs Arsenal prediction and preview. Can the table-topping Gunners maintain their momentum? It may have been a little too close for comfort in the closing minutes, but Arsenal consolidated their position as Premier League leaders with a 2-1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday, their fifth victory in a row in all competitions. It’s a quick turnaround for the Gunners now as they become the latest English top-flight giant to visit Kenilworth Road, looking to maintain their momentum against Luton Town on Tuesday. The hosts made a blistering start to go 2-0 up within 13 minutes on Saturday versus Wolves, with Bukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard capping two flowing team moves with pinpoint finishes. Saka’s opener was Arsenal’s 100th goal across all competitions in 2023, making them the fifth team from Europe’s big five leagues to net a century this calendar year, after Man City, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen. With their weekend’s work done, Arsenal were then able to put their feet up as Manchester City played out a chaotic 3-3 draw with Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, while Liverpool won a seven-goal thriller against Fulham, as the Gunners ended Matchday 14 two points clear at the summit. Mikel Arteta was, however, left frustrated by a series of missed chances that allowed Wolves to stay in Saturday’s game, with his team forced to survive a tense finale after Oleksandr Zinchenko’s mistake allowed Matheus Cunha to make it 2-1. Arsenal have not hit the heights of last season in attack thus far, but Arteta was pleased with their disciplined defending last time out, and they have faced the fewest shots on target (35) and expected goals (11.27 xG) of any Premier League side in 2023-24. On the road, no team has kept more clean sheets (four) or conceded fewer goals (three) than Arsenal in the Premier League this campaign, with three of their four away wins – against Crystal Palace, Everton and Brentford – coming by 1-0 scorelines. Takehiro Tomiyasu’s return to the lineup has helped Arsenal defensively, but he is doubtful for Tuesday’s game after limping off late on Saturday and could be replaced by Ben White. Defender Jurriën Timber as well as midfield trio Thomas Partey, Fabio Vieira and Emile Smith Rowe are the Gunners’ confirmed absentees. David Raya is expected to continue in goal, with Aaron Ramsdale on the bench. In attack, Saka could make his 200th appearance for the club in all competitions. At the age of 22 years and 91 days, he would be the second youngest Englishman to reach that milestone for Arsenal after Cliff Bastin (22 years, 16 days) and the youngest player overall since Cesc Fàbregas in 2008 (21 years, 118 days). Saka’s 10 goal involvements in the Premier League this season (five goals, five assists) are twice as many as any other Arsenal player (Ødegaard and Eddie Nketiah have five), and each of the winger’s last nine league goal contributions have either drawn Arsenal level (two) or put them ahead (seven). Luton, meanwhile, are looking to respond to Saturday’s 3-1 defeat at Brentford, with results elsewhere seeing their cushion to the relegation zone cut to two points as Everton and Burnley picked up much-needed victories. Rob Edwards’ side faced 27 shots in London this weekend, the most Brentford have ever managed in a Premier League game. Jacob Brown’s left-footed finish briefly put the Hatters in contention, but they ultimately suffered a deserved loss as Neal Maupay, Ben Mee and Shandon Baptiste struck for the Bees. Brown was also on target when Luton clinched their first Premier League victory at Kenilworth Road one week earlier, joining Teden Mengi in netting in a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace. He last scored in three consecutive league appearances in April 2019, with Barnsley in League One. While Luton have lost three of their six Premier League games at Kenilworth Road (one win, two draws), conceding in each match, they have caused opponents problems at the throwback ground, with October’s 1-0 loss to Tottenham the only home game in which they haven’t scored this term. Edwards has a few selection concerns ahead of Tuesday, with Alfie Doughty, Marvelous Nakamba and Cauley Woodrow unlikely to recover in time to face Arsenal. Defenders Mengi and Tom Lockyer will be assessed after being substituted with knocks on Saturday. Tuesday’s game will be the first between Luton and Arsenal in any competition since December 1991, when the Hatters claimed a 1-0 top-flight victory at Kenilworth Road in the old Division One. Not that it’s reflective of the current stature of both clubs, Arsenal are actually winless in their last 10 trips to Luton across all competitions. They’ve recorded six draws and four defeats since managing a 2-1 league victory under Don Howe in January 1984. This fixture has cup history, too. Luton won their only major honour with their 1988 Football League Cup final victory over Arsenal at Wembley Stadium, winning 3-2 after being 2-1 down with eight minutes remaining – Brian Stein the hero with a last-minute winner in front of 95,732 fans on 24 April 1988. This match will, of course, represent the first Premier League meeting between the clubs, and Arsenal have won six of their last seven games when facing a team for the first time in the competition. The only exception in that run came in the Gunners’ last such match as they were beaten 2-0 at Brentford on the opening matchday of the 2021-22 campaign. For Luton’s fans, the visit of the Premier League leaders will be a real occasion to savour, but the Hatters have only won one of their last 14 top-flight games against teams starting the day at the summit (four draws, nine defeats). Their only victory in that sequence came by a 3-1 scoreline against Liverpool in February 1991, though this will be their first such match since a 1-1 draw with Manchester United in April 1992. While Arsenal are chasing a fourth successive Premier League victory since last tasting defeat against Newcastle on 4 November. They have beaten Burnley, Brentford and Wolves in league competition since then, in addition to UEFA Champions League victories over both Sevilla and Lens at the Emirates Stadium. Luton have only won one of their last eight league matches (two draws, five losses). The Hatters have, however, avoided defeat in their last two at Kenilworth Road (one win, one draw). They will hope to preserve their strong record in games played on Tuesdays, having only lost three of their last 22 such contests in league action (11 wins, eight draws). However, one of those defeats did come in their only previous Premier League game to be played on a Tuesday, losing 2-1 at home to Burnley in October. Arsenal, meanwhile, have won 55.7% of their Premier League games played between Fridays and Mondays, compared to just 48% of those played between Tuesdays and Thursdays. Luton will be hoping the Gunners endure another awkward evening on their short midweek trip to Bedfordshire. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off on Tuesday, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides The Opta Player Ratings are something we introduced ahead of 2023-24. For a quick primer on how they’re calculated, you can check our explainer here. Before kick-off in this match, here are the top five performing players from both teams in the 2023-24 Premier League according to the Opta Player Ratings: Thomas Kaminski: 65.0 (out of 100)Tahith Chong: 61.9Chiedozie Ogbene: 60.6Alfie Doughty: 60.1Gabriel Osho: 59.4 Declan Rice: 80.6 (out of 100)Oleksandr Zinchenko: 80.4Martin Ødegaard: 75.3Bukayo Saka: 75.3Ben White: 74.6 These Opta Player Ratings also power our set of brand-new, free-to-play gaming experiences, which you can play on Opta Analyst all season long. With their title rivals not in action until Wednesday, Arsenal have a chance to move – at least temporarily – five points clear at the summit of the Premier League table on Tuesday. The Opta supercomputer fancies their chances of doing exactly that. Of 10,000 match simulations conducted ahead of kick-off, Arsenal won 56.1%, Luton won 18.8%, and 25.1% finished level. According to the supercomputer’s season predictions, Arsenal were major beneficiaries of Man City’s draw with Spurs. Their chances of ending 2023-24 top of the Premier League table are now up to 15.5%, though City (67.3%) and Liverpool (15.9%) are still more fancied. Luton, meanwhile, saw several fellow relegation candidates pick up results on Matchday 14. They drop to the Championship in 61.3% of our simulations, with only Sheffield United (93.7%) and Burnley (78.5%) at greater risk of the drop. Enjoy this?

4837,"Manchester City's winners, losers and ratings after magical fundraiser in Barcelona","Barcelona and Manchester City interrupted their respective starts to the season to play a fundraiser at Camp Nou for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) research.  A crowd of 91,962 was at the stadium to raise money in aid of former goalkeeper Juan Carlos Unzue, and they were treated to an entertaining 3-3 draw.  Argentine striker Julian Alvarez gave City the lead before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Frenkie de Jong scored for the home side.  Cole Palmer equalised, Memphis Depay put Barca back ahead, before Riyad Mahrez scored an injury-time penalty after Erling Haaland was tripped.  Unzue, who was diagnosed with the progressive neurodegenerative disease two years ago, was proud to be able to raise such a large amount to fund research at the Luzon Foundation.

7719,10 THINGS WE LEARNED from LaLiga...,"Joan Laporta had a one-man battle with the buffet on Sunday night as Barcelona turned in another awful display against Granada.  The previous night Real Madrid blew away Girona's title challenge with Vinicius and Jude Bellingham proving unstoppable on the night. Meanwhile, Diego Simeone's Atletico slipped in the league and Sevilla's find of the season, Isaac Romero, eased their relegation fears with another goal. Here are the 10 things we learned from Spain this weekend.  The deep fried prawns and Spanish omelette bites were flying in hospitality at the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona on Sunday night after club president Joan Laporta took his ire out on the canapes following Barcelona's 3-3 draw with relegation favourites Granada. At least that is what Radio Catalonia was reporting after the game. He's believed to have turned over at least one tray of finger food. It's hard to know what will have upset him more: the performance, or the fact that some fans chanted against him as president? Barcelona trail Real Madrid by 10 points and although there are 14 games left it's hard to see how Barcelona can go on a run of winning a decent portion of those games, or how Real Madrid can go on a run of losing a decent portion of those games. What seems more likely is that Barcelona will spiral into further chaos as they realise keeping Xavi is costing them a place in the top two, and so their place in the lucrative Spanish Super Cup next season.  It was something about the way he didn't really celebrate when he scored from outside the area to make it 3-3 that drove home the fact that Lamine Yamal plays and carries himself more like an establish star at Barcelona than any else. Barca's best player so far this season will not be 17 until June. He is the only thing they can be positive about at the moment, and he knew a draw against Granada was nothing to shout about.  'I don't usually shoot from outside the area' he said after his brilliant performance powered Real Madrid to victory over Girona on Saturday night. He also doesn't usually play Luka Modric-style passes like the one with the outside of his foot that set up Jude Bellingham for Real Madrid's second goal. He is becoming a more complete player than he was last season.  The French great scored nine league goals in two of his five seasons at Real Madrid. Jude Bellingham is already on 16 and ought to finish with more than double that figure. To think some scoffed when he took Zidane's old No 5 shirt and was compared to him in the summer. What he needs to do now is lead England to glory in the way that 'Zizou' led France. At least his ankle injury is just a strain and should not mean he misses any more than four Real Madrid games. He'll be back to meet Vinicius as well when England play Brazil on March 23.  Girona paid for a massive sign that read 'Curriculum is not everything' in the middle of Madrid in the build-up to their game with the club that has won the Spanish league 35 times. It's true that history can't win you things in the here and now but Carlo Ancelotti has a claim to be football's finest-ever manager precisely because he prepares teams to be at their best when it matters most. Girona's marketing was inspired but on the pitch only Madrid were at the level. No one has scored more goals with his head this season (five) and Real Madrid were missing all four of their centre-backs through injury. With full-back Dani Carvajal and midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni in centre-defence Madrid could have been there for the taking, instead LaLiga's top scorers going into the game failed to muster a shot on target, much less a header from Dovbyk against that diminutive defence. The 'no Isco, no Disco' doomsday scenario didn't come to pass for Betis who comfortably beat Cadiz 2-0 away on Friday without their talisman who's out for a month with a hamstring tear. Manuel Pellegrini is still on course to guide Betis into Europe and Mauricio Pellegrino's arrival looks to have done nothing to halt Cadiz's slide into the second tier.  Diego Simeone complained about the fact that Atletico Madrid play next Saturday and their Champions League rivals Inter, who they play the following Tuesday, will have played their Serie A game 24 hours before. 'Inter play Friday; we play Saturday thanks LaLiga and the Spanish Federation,' Simeone said sarcastically. It's convenient to shift the focus from a disastrous league campaign. He has as good a squad as Real Madrid and yet the gap with so many games left is now 13 points.  Who knows what kind of season Sevilla might have had if they had promoted B-team striker Isaac Romero to the first team earlier. He has five goals in his first seven games for the club and his winner on Saturday against Atletico Madrid takes them much closer to safety.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/10-THINGS-WE-LEARNED-from-LaLiga.../3301357,,14-Feb,all-football-app
4308,Liverpool defeat Southampton to maintain title pursuit despite missing key players,"Liverpool defeated Southampton 2-1 on Tuesday despite manager Jurgen Klopp leaving out key players as the club try to keep their Premier League title hopes alive. Thiago, Naby Keita, Luis Diaz and Andrew Robertson were on the bench, while Trent Alexander-Arnold, Fabinho, Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Virgil van Dijk were left out of the squad. The Reds needed to avoid defeat against the Saints in order to enter the final match of the season with the possibility of edging Manchester City for the title. Klopp was forced to alter his approach against Southampton after an 120-minute FA Cup final over the weekend. Injuries to Van Dijk and Salah played a part in his thinking, but he also likely wanted to rest key players ahead of the Champions League final on May 28. As a result, several fringe players got a rare opportunity against Southampton - Takumi Minamino made his first Premier League start of the season; his last came for the Saints while on loan there last year. Liverpool's health problems are not currently expected to affect their line-up plans against Real Madrid. 🟡 TEAM NEWS 🔴This is how we line up for #SOULIV tonight 👊 ""It's unbelievable, what they've done makes it even more special,"" Klopp told Sky Sports. ""Outstanding. What can I say about this group? ""It's a crime Minamino doesn't play more. Harvey [Elliott] didn't play for a long time. Curtis [Jones] didn't play much. They deliver. It's unbelievable. Making nine changes and this performance is exceptional. ""We would have had much more problems today if we'd played the guys who played 120 minutes on Saturday."" Jordan Henderson echoed those comments, telling Sky Sports: ""We've done that really well all season, the lads who haven't played as much as they'd like took their opportunity. You need everyone in a Premier League season."" The Reds are still mathematically alive in the title hunt, but they'll need help from elsewhere to jump ahead of Manchester City before the finish line. Liverpool are likely required to collect all six points from their final two games and see Manchester City draw or lose against Aston Villa on Sunday. If the Reds collect four points from their final two matches, they would need to make up significant ground in goal difference and have Manchester City lose to Aston Villa. ""It's hard to focus on the game,"" Henderson admitted about the final match of the season against Wolves. ""We've learned from that experience [three years ago]. We'll concentrate on what we need to do [and hope] Villa do us a favour.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/salah-mane-van-dijk-liverpool-miss-key-players-southampton/blt65063da4c0f842bd,Dan Bernstein,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1677,'Fake news!' - Augsburg respond to false quote that USMNT star Pepi was peed on during club initiation,"Augsburg have labelled a quote claiming that United States national team star Ricardo Pepi was peed on by Markus Weinzierl as part of a club initiation ceremony ""fake news"". Pepi became Augsburg's new club-record signing when he arrived in Bavaria from FC Dallas for €18 million (£15m/$20m) on January 3, with the 19-year-old committing to a four-and-a-half-year contract. Augsburg beat a number of top European clubs to Pepi's signature, including Liverpool and Bayern Munich, but his start to life in Germany has been marred slightly by online trolls. Pepi gave an interview to Sport Bild earlier this week outlining his ambitions as an Augsburg player, setting his sights on Champions League qualification while also singling out Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski as his main role model. A fake quote from that interview subsequently began doing the rounds on social media, with it claimed that Augsburg boss Weinzierl welcomed the teenager to the club by urinating on him in the showers at the club training ground. The Bundesliga outfit have now come out to rubbish the report, writing on Twitter: ""Actually obvious that this 'quote' is fake! We can laugh about a lot and often don't take ourselves too seriously.  ""But since some of you out there seem to think so, let's make it clear that this is fake."" Pepi was handed his Augsburg debut in their 3-1 loss at Hoffenheim on January 8 as he came on for the final 30 minutes when the visitors were trying to get back into the game. The American forward impressed enough to make Weinzierl's starting XI in their next Bundesliga outing, playing 84 minutes of a 1-1 draw with Eintracht Frankfurt. Pepi looked lively in his first home game for the club and might have scored twice on another day as he squandered two clear openings, but will likely have the chance to break his duck again when Augsburg take on Bayer Leverkusen this weekend.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fake-news-augsburg-respond-to-false-quote-that-usmnt-star/bltda209e30927701ef,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

However, many supporters believe his arrival has affected Emile Smith Rowe's development and the club should not have signed him in the first place.But deserve to start based on stats? Well, the image below shows that both players' end products are very identical. Havertz has scored more goals with superior key passes. No surprise as he plays primarily in attack.

5832,Suarez to be reunited with Messi at Inter Miami? Former Barcelona striker discusses MLS transfer rumours,"Luis Suarez's future still hangs in the balance after the forward left Atletico Madrid as a free agent in May 2022. He had previously admitted that a potential reunion with Lionel Messi at Inter Miami holds great appeal to him but it seems that the probability has completely evaporated, at least for the time being.  Suarez and Messi won numerous trophies together at Barcelona between 2014 and 2020, including four La Liga titles and the Champions League. The former left Camp Nou in acrimonious circumstances and his close friend Messi came out in support of him with an emotional and explosive Instagram post that included the words: ""It will be strange to see you in another shirt and much more to come up against you on the pitch. You deserved a farewell that fit with who you are: one of the most important players in the history of the club. Someone who achieved great things for the team and on an individual level"". Suarez was strongly linked with a move to MLS amid suggestions that he would like to wind his career down in the United States after turning 35. Latin American broadcaster DIRECTV Sports claimed that Messi will sign for Inter Miami when he becomes a free agent on June 30, 2023. Messi's entourage denied the reports via French outlet Le Parisien. “It is completely false. Leo has not yet decided on his future,"" the statement from the PSG star's entourage read. Now Suarez has also come out denying any possibility of a reunion of the two friends any time soon at Inter Miami.  ""Play with Messi at Inter Miami? That is not real. Many things are said. We players cannot go out 24 hours a day to deny what they say. We let them talk; we let them say. Leo has his future in Paris. Then I don’t know where he will want to retire,” Suarez said to Último al Arco de Sport 890.  ""I have my project, which is at a sports level now. And then discuss it with my family. Then, if we both end up living in Barcelona? Yes, because we are friends, families are friends. But from there to having a sports project together… they speculate, they talk a lot, they sell a lot. They have to leave that,"" he added.  It is believed that Luis Suarez has three offers to stay in Europe. He was linked to a move to Aston Villa, where he would reunite with former Liverpool team-mate Steven Gerrard. He revealed that he has a few offers to continue in Spain as well and that he is weighing them up. ""Spain? Obviously one left a great legacy here, I'm very proud of the career I've had here,"" he said. ""I have received some proposals from here, but I am still analysing them. I want to see the project of being able to compete at a high level."" The Uruguayan was also touted to join River Plate in Argentina but that move fell through after the team lost out in the round of 16 of the Copa Libertadores. Then the striker went on to flirt with his boyhood Nacional, for a possible move.  ""If I came to think and get excited about the possibility of River, the same would happen with that of Nacional, which was my home,"" he said. ""I am surprised that the leaders of Nacional did not even call me to find out my situation. A player needs love. River was giving it to me and Nacional could have tried that.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/suarez-reunited-messi-inter-miami-barcelona-mls-transfer/bltb9d297674a41ad53,Soham Mukherjee,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

2945,Bellingham handed €40k fine after 'match-fixing' remarks against Dortmund vs Bayern referee Felix Zwayer,"Jude Bellingham has been handed a €40,000 fine by the German Football Association (DFB) after his ""match-fixing"" remarks against Felix Zwayer, the referee for the Borussia Dortmund vs Bayern Munich clash. Dortmund were on the wrong end of a 3-2 scoreline against their arch-rivals in a top-of-the-table Bundesliga clash at Westfalenstadion on December 4, with Robert Lewandowski grabbing the winning goal from the penalty spot. The hosts clearly disagreed with the award of the spot-kick, though, and Bellingham questioned why Zwayer was allowed to officiate such a crucial game due to his past involvement in a match-fixing scandal. ""For me, it wasn't [a penalty],"" Bellingham told reporters after the game. ""[Mats] Hummels isn't even looking at the ball, he's fighting to get it and it just sort of hits him... it hits him and I don't even think he's looking at the ball. ""You can look at a lot of the decisions in the game, you give a referee that has match-fixed before the biggest game in Germany, what do you expect?"" DFB referee supervisor Marco Haase launched a complaint against Bellingham for his controversial comments about Zwayer, leading to an investigation being carried out. The England international midfielder, while escaping a ban for his comments, has been given a fine of €40k, with his post-match quotes having been deemed ""unsportsmanlike conduct"". Dortmund and Bellingham have accepted the ban, meanwhile, meaning that the 18-year-old will be available to face Bochum in the Bundesliga club's next domestic match on December 11. Defending the former Birmingham City star's comments before the outcome of the investigation, Michael Zorc spoke to SID and insisted that Bellingham's outburst had been blown out of proportion. ""The boy is 18, talking after a heated, emotional game,"" he said. ""He names old facts, you don't have to do that. We stand by him. I don't see anything problematic in terms of criminal law."" Bayern CEO Oliver Kahn, meanwhile, was far more damning in his assessment of Bellingham, as he told Sky Germany: ""I'm the last one who doesn't understand player emotions. They (Bellingham's comments) go a huge step too far, of course. I don't remember any player saying that before. I don't know how he got the idea to make such a statement.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bellingham-under-investigation-from-dfb-after-match-fixing/blt561a17dc9940526e,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

11610,The Most Decisive Goals in Premier League History,"Today marks 10 years since Aguero.  You remember: 93:20. Balotelli’s assist. The Goal That Changed Everything. The Match That Had Everything. Joe Hart on throw-in duties. Joey Barton’s long walk off. A surprisingly iconic QPR away kit. I think Edin Dzeko did something or other. Drink it in. I swear you’ll never see anything like this again.  Sometimes goals are so iconic that they don’t need a date or a time. Just a single name. Michael Thomas, Jimmy Glass. Aguero.  But while that fifth goal in the Manchester City 3-2 QPR game in 2012 is unarguably the most decisive goal in Premier League history, it’s not the only important one. Here, then, are some from the competition’s current total of 30,913 goals that stand out just that little bit more from the rest. The goal that cemented the often-misunderstood concept of Fergie-Time™️ while inching Manchester United closer to their first league title since the 1960s. Bruce had scored minutes earlier to level the game so those goals should really be seen as a fully-fledged double salvo. The United defender, always a goal threat, scored more Premier League goals in this campaign than Andrei Kanchelskis and Steve McManaman but it was this second effort against Sheffield Wednesday on Easter Saturday that finally made a nation believe that Manchester United could become champions of England again.

Well it happened on a few occasions in the 1990s and no more desperately than in 1993-94, when at 2-0 down at home to Wimbledon in the final game of the season, Mike Walker’s Everton were staring the second tier right in the face. A lot of contemporary assumptions about football date from the early 1990s and perhaps this was the moment that the false narrative “2-0 is a dangerous lead” solidified in a nation’s mind. Because Everton, against all odds, came back and won the game with the unusual combination of a penalty and two goals from outside the box. They all count.

That still left the title in Alex Ferguson’s team’s hands as they played Aston Villa, two points behind Liverpool that morning but with two games in hand. Even so, when they trailed 2-1 to a Villa team featuring James Milner with 10 minutes to go, the momentum was absolutely with Liverpool. But first Cristiano Ronaldo equalised and then in injury time a 17 year old making his debut, Federico Macheda, turned audaciously in the penalty area before bending home a goal that gave United the win.

Taiwo later claimed to ESPN that “I have watched the full game many times, maybe more than a hundred times” a full-game rewatch figure which seems unrealistically high.  If the Inexplicable Brief Flowering Of Macheda in 2009 had convinced some Liverpool fans that they were destined never to be champions of England again, then the way 2013-14 concluded brought in many more converts. From Steven Gerrard’s slip against Mohamed Salah’s Chelsea, to Crystanbul a few days later, it was the most scripted non-scripted sporting denouement the league had ever seen.

But the fact that it was prologue to Leicester winning the Premier League in the same season elevates it to a higher plane. Yes the title was sealed by the failure of Tottenham to stay in touch, but Vardy’s relentless autumn was the canvas on to which the glory of spring 2016 was painted.  ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️Remembering when @vardy7 made @PremierLeague history by scoring in 11 consecutive games 😱 pic.twitter.com/0qQZXFtmja The facts are these: Vincent Kompany played in 265 Premier League games.

Pep Guardiola’s team won their last 14 Premier League games. Liverpool lost one league game all season (at the Etihad, unfortunately) and ended up with 98 points. City ended with one point more, largely thanks to Vincent Kompany ignoring all precedent and advice and casually scoring an absolute screamer.

Why not throw that scenario into a world where the referee is awarding penalty via a TV screen positioned on the touchline in a stadium containing no fans because football is tentatively taking place amid a global pandemic?

The 24-year-old USMNT defender was seen displaying a magic trick in front of his fellow players where he goes on shuffling and picking out from a deck of cards in his hands while narrating a story to his audience. He had even asked the support staff to cut the deck, once at the very beginning and once in between. In the end, he held up a flush (a hand where all the cards are of the same suit) while all the other cards lay on the table in front of him. Robinson’s team-mates were left mesmerized by the magic as they were seen cheering for him. Other than card magic tricks and his talent on the field, Robinson also has a knack for piano.

10553,Manchester United vs Brentford: Prediction and Preview,"Manchester United have made a dismal start to the season and are in dire need of three points on Saturday. Will they get them? We look ahead to the Premier League game at Old Trafford with our Manchester United vs Brentford prediction and preview. If Erik ten Hag thought a change of competition might bring some much-needed respite, he was gravely mistaken. Manchester United suffered their fifth defeat in seven matches on Tuesday as Galatasaray twice came from behind for a famous 3-2 UEFA Champions League win at Old Trafford, increasing the pressure on Ten Hag ahead of Saturday’s Premier League visit of Brentford. In addition to sitting bottom of their Champions League group with zero points, United approach Saturday’s game 10th in the Premier League table, already nine points adrift of the summit. They have lost six of their 10 games across all competitions so far in 2023-24 while conceding 18 goals, the most they have shipped at this stage of a season since 1966-67 (20). Several individual errors cost United in midweek, making Rasmus Højlund’s brace immaterial. Diogo Dalot’s weak defending allowed Wilfried Zaha to score against his former club for the fourth time, while André Onana’s misplaced pass led to Casemiro receiving a second booking. Stand-in left-back Sofyan Amrabat was then slow step up after making a clearance, thus playing Mauro Icardi onside as he ran through to score the winner. It’s fair to say Old Trafford isn’t currently a destination feared by travelling sides. United have lost their last two home games in the Premier League against Brighton & Hove Albion and Crystal Palace, having only lost two of their previous 34 at home in the competition (25 wins, seven draws). They last lost three successive home league games in February 1979. As he looks to avert another home humiliation, Ten Hag will be hoping for positive news on the injury front. While defenders Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martínez – who has suffered a setback in his recovery from a metatarsal injury – are all out for the foreseeable future, Sergio Reguilón will be assessed. Jadon Sancho remains frozen out amid reports he may leave in the January transfer window. In attack, United need an improvement from Marcus Rashford. Having scored 17 Premier League goals from 15.8 expected goals (xG) last season, he has netted once from 2.7 xG in 2023-24. He is second only to Manchester City’s Erling Haaland for total shots and direct shot involvements in the Premier League this season but has looked devoid of confidence lately. There is some hope though in the fact his last four Premier League goals have come against London-based clubs. Brentford have themselves endured a frustrating start to the season, only winning one of nine games in all competitions (five draws, three defeats). They have gone seven without a win since overcoming Fulham in August, though that run does include a penalty shootout success at Newport County in the League Cup. It’s not as if Thomas Frank’s men haven’t had their opportunities, either. No Premier League team has dropped more points from winning positions this season than Brentford’s eight (tied with Bournemouth), with two more having been squandered last Sunday. The Bees looked set for a morale-boosting win when Christian Nørgaard nodded them in front against 10-man Nottingham Forest, only to be denied by Nicolás Domínguez’s header in what turned out to be a 1-1 draw. Frank felt aggrieved after that game, with Brentford denied a penalty despite Yoane Wissa appearing to be fouled by Forest goalkeeper Matt Turner. Wissa has featured in each of Brentford’s last 71 Premier League games, while strike partner Bryan Mbeumo has played in their last 64. The duo rank second and fourth respectively for the longest current runs without missing a top-flight match. Fellow forward Ivan Toney made a goalscoring return in a behind-closed-doors friendly against Como this week, but he remains banned until January after breaching the Football Association’s betting rules. Brentford’s attacking options were further depleted by last week’s revelation that Kevin Schade will miss several months with an adductor injury. Rico Henry is out for the remainder of the season, while Ben Mee is not expected to return until after the international break. Brentford have at least remained solid without the defender, with only Man City (3.35), Chelsea (4.62) and Arsenal (5.06) allowing less than their 5.51 xG against from open play in the Premier League this term. Manchester United have won three of their four Premier League meetings with Brentford, though the lone defeat was a memorable one when they were thrashed 4-0 last August in Ten Hag’s first away game in charge. The Red Devils have won both home Premier League matches against Brentford without conceding; 3-0 in 2021-22 and 1-0 when the teams last met in April. Indeed, Old Trafford has not been a happy hunting ground for Brentford, who have lost their last five away games against United in all competitions. Their last win at Old Trafford came by a 3-1 scoreline in February 1937. However, United have lost all three of their Premier League games against London clubs this season – versus Tottenham, Arsenal and Crystal Palace. They have not lost four in a row against London clubs in league action since September 1986, while they last lost as many as four games against London-based sides in a single season in 2006-07. Manchester United have won two of their four home games in the Premier League this season, earning unconvincing victories over Wolves and Forest before their defeats to Brighton and Palace. The Red Devils have conceded first in each of their last three league matches at Old Trafford, and they have only shipped the opening goal in four successive home league games on two previous occasions – between February and March 2014 and between July and September 2020. United’s tendency to start slowly may not be music to Brentford’s ears, however. The Bees have only won one of the five Premier League games in which they have struck first this campaign, being pegged back in draws with Tottenham, Palace, Bournemouth and Forest. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta supercomputer makes Man Utd favourites here, with the under-fire hosts taking three points in 45.3% of 10,000 match simulations ahead of kick-off. Another disappointing home result is far from ruled out, however. Brentford are assigned a 26.6% chance of victory, with 28.1% of simulations finishing level. Manchester United’s awful form has had a drastic impact on the supercomputer’s season predictions. They were given a 63.2% probability of a top-four finish and qualification for the Champions League before a ball was kicked, but that has now dropped as low as 4%. Brentford are not thought to be in serious danger yet, with just a 1% chance of relegation, and their most likely final position is deemed to be 12th, finishing there in 16.8% of simulations.

7363,Saliba confirms Arsenal return as Marseille miss out on loan transfer extension,"William Saliba has confirmed he will be returning to Arsenal this summer, with Marseille now set to miss out on a loan transfer extension for the Frenchman. Arsenal sent Saliba out on loan for the third time since signing him from Saint-Etienne in 2019 last summer as Marseille snapped him up on a season-long deal. The 21-year-old played a key role in helping the club finish second in Ligue 1 last term and subsequently expressed his desire to stay at Stade Velodrome to play Champions League football, but has now performed a U-turn on his future. Saliba won the Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year award while earning a spot in the French national team squad as a result of his stellar performances for Marseille, and is eager to transfer that form to Emirates Stadium. The centre-half has yet to make a competitive appearance for Arsenal but he is determined to force his way into Mikel Arteta's plans. ""I belong to Arsenal, and I still have two years there. I will be there for pre-season with Arsenal,"" Saliba has told Telefoot. ""I have played zero matches with Arsenal and I want to show them what I’m made of and have the chance to play for the supporters and for this big club. ""That depends only on me. In any case, leaving (Arsenal) like that would be a shame.”  Arteta has always been confident about Saliba returning to the Emirates and believes his experience in Marseille will hold him in good stead for the 2022-23 campaign. The Arsenal boss has no regrets over his initial decision to give the green light for the France international's temporary switch to Marseille, despite seeing his side miss out on a top-four Premier League finish in 2021-22. “We made the right decision,"" Arteta said last month. ""He has to come back. He has the experience necessary to be competitive with us. “If he had stayed with us this year, with one Premier League match a week, with Ben White and Gabriel, he wouldn't have had half the playing time he had with Marseille, that's for sure. “For his growth and what he can do next season that wouldn't have been good. William wasn't with us because he wouldn't have had the playing time to gain experience. That's it, there's nothing else.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/saliba-confirms-arsenal-return-as-marseille-miss-out-on-loan/bltbee3852b3c23222c,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
599,'I was drunk!' - PSG forward Neymar jokes about his goal vs Lorient as he aims dig at journalist,"Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar has joked that he was ""drunk"" when scoring his sensational solo goal against Lorient in a clear dig at a French journalist that criticised him last month. PSG edged closer to regaining the Ligue 1 title with a comprehensive 5-1 win over Lorient on Sunday, with Neymar and Kylian Mbappe both netting braces and Lionel Messi completing the scoring. All five of the home side's goals were eye-catching, but Neymar's second stood out most as he ran from inside his own half and played a neat one-two with Mbappe before calmly slotting the ball home. RMC Radio reporter Daniel Riolo made headlines in March for claiming that Neymar ""turns up drunk for training"", which prompted Lyon star Lucas Paqueta to come out and publicly defend his Brazil international team-mate. Neymar couldn't resist getting in his own response after the Lorient game, with the 30-year-old taking to social media to explain how he managed to score his second goal. “I was 'drunk', that's why it worked... as they say around there,"" Neymar wrote as a caption above the goal video on his Instagram stories. Neymar has been subjected to intense scrutiny throughout the 2021-22 campaign, with familiar injury problems once again preventing him from producing his best form on a regular basis. The Brazil international was even booed by fans following PSG's round of 16 Champions League exit at the hands of Real Madrid, and continues to frustrate with his inconsistency. Neymar's two-goal showing against Lorient served as a reminder of what he is capable of, but he has only managed to find the net seven times in 22 appearances in all competitions, while also adding a modest total of five assists.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/drunk-psg-forward-neymar-jokes-goal-lorient-dig-journalist/blt4d374b135cb59fe0,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2989,Arsenal confirm Pepe loan deal with French side Nice as flop forward not in Arteta's plans,"WHAT'S HAPPENING? The winger will head back to France on a one-year loan, with Nice not having any option to buy at the conclusion of the deal. THE BIGGER PICTURE: The move comes in the wake of several disappointing seasons for Pepe, the £72m ($85m) club-record signing at Arsenal. The former Lille winger has never quite convinced with the Gunners, and has been left out of Mikel Arteta's plans this season. AND WHAT'S MORE: The winger, who has played 112 times and scored 27 goals for Arsenal, had previously said he was ""determined"" to fight for his future at the Emirates despite multiple offers to leave. IN TWO PHOTOS: High hopes... ...that never panned out. THE VERDICT: Pepe’s time has been up at Arsenal for a while. It was clear last season that Arteta had lost trust in the winger. So this will be a good move for him and it would be no surprise to see him get his career going again back in Ligue 1. For Arsenal, now the focus has to be on bringing in a replacement. It’s all well and good letting Pepe go, but they need someone to help take the heat of the already overworked Bukayo Saka over on the right-hand side. WHAT NEXT FOR ARSENAL? The Gunners currently sit atop the Premier League and will face Fulham on August 27.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-agree-pepe-loan-deal-with-french-side-nice-as-flop/blt6b4884f1a7a7477b,Charles Watts,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7039,Messi to play with GOAT on his sleeve as PSG announce new partnership,"Lionel Messi is set to play with the word GOAT on his sleeve alongside the rest of the Paris Saint-Germain squad as the club have announced a new multi-year partnership with the next generation lifestyle platform. GOAT have linked up with PSG as an official partner until the end of the season and, from July 1 onwards, will have their brand name stamped on the sleeves of training, warm-up and matchday jerseys. The online platform, which offers luxury apparel and accessories via primary and resale markets, has over 30 million members across the globe and will now benefit from even more exposure after inking a deal with the Ligue 1 giants. Messi has modelled the new design next to Neymar, Marco Verratti, Georginio Wijnaldum and Achraf Hakimi, with Kylian Mbappe a notable absentee amid ongoing reports linking him with a transfer to Real Madrid. PSG's chief partnerships officer, Marc Armstrong, has said of the union: ""We are delighted to welcome GOAT into the Paris Saint-Germain family. Thanks to this partnership, GOAT joins the tight list of club partners present on our emblematic jerseys.  ""GOAT is the ideal partner for the club. It reinforces our position as an icon of sport and style with fans around the world. Together, we will develop exciting and creative experiences to delight fans everywhere."" 🆕📲👕@PSG_English and @goatapp, the global lifestyle platform announce a major multiyear global partnership that will see 𝗚𝗢𝗔𝗧 become the new official sleeve partner of the club from next season, with upcoming avant-garde collaborations ❤️💙https://t.co/QpMHdtYC9b Eddy Lu, co-founder and CEO of the GOAT group, has added: ""Paris Saint-Germain is one of the most influential clubs in the world and we are delighted to partner with them to continue building our global community.  ""We bring together two great lifestyle brands to unite and mobilize communities of athletes, creatives and fans around the world. This partnership plays to each other's strengths, with innovative collaborations in the months and years to come."" GOAT stands for 'greatest of all time' in football circles, an unofficial moniker that has been given to Messi in light of his outstanding achievements in the game. On social media, it has become a theme for supporters to post goat emojis when mentioning the PSG star, who has a record seven Ballons d'Or to his name and is the all-time record scorer for both Barcelona and the Argentina national team. Messi won numerous La Liga and Champions League titles during his 17-year stay at Camp Nou, which ended when his contract expired last summer, and is on course to add a Ligue 1 crown to his collection this season.

2982,Lampard fearing Gordon exit as Chelsea transfer chase continues,"Frank Lampard has conceded that he cannot assure Everton fans that Anthony Gordon will not leave the club this summer as Chelsea continue to chase a deal for the talented winger. The Toffees have tried to ward off interest from Chelsea, reportedly rejecting a second bid of £45 million ($53m) bid for Gordon, and it is thought that an improved offer could come in the next week. Gordon is understood to want to test himself in Europe's premier competition, the Champions League, and it would be difficult for Lampard to stand in his way. Lampard is reluctant to lose Gordon, but is also realistic when it comes to the business of football, telling a press conference when asked if Gordon would be staying: “You can’t ask me to assure anything - that would be naïve of me to assure anything. ""Selling players, just as it is with bringing players in, it has to be a joined-up say so. When you’re talking about the level of player Anthony is and the value of player, we know what those kind of players go for. “It’s a serious situation on a football and a club business level, simple as that. If you can join those two up and make the right decision… The football one is the most important to me, because that is what I’m judged on. ""But we know his value.

10041,Highest Scoring Teams in a Champions League Season,"Which teams have scored the most goals in a single UEFA Champions League season, and who holds the record for the most goals in a UCL group stage? We look back at the most lethal teams in the competition’s history. Barcelona hold the record for the most goals scored in a single UCL season, with 45 in the 1999-00 campaign. Helped by the fact that the format that season saw more games played (they played in 16 of a possible 17 matches), their tally has not been replicated before or since. Barca were knocked out in the semi-finals by Valencia, and they saw 13 different players score for them in 1999-00 (excluding own goals) – only Real Madrid in 2001-02 (14) and Borussia Dortmund in 2016-17 (15) have seen their UCL goals come via a wider spread of players across a single season. Rivaldo was their top scorer this season with 10 goals – finishing joint-top of the goal rankings in 1999-00 alongside Real Madrid legend Raúl and Mário Jardel of FC Porto. Unsurprising maybe, given the number of games they played, but Barcelona’s games this season witnessed 68 goals overall – the most of any club in a Champions League season. They conceded 23 goals themselves, which is the seventh highest tally of any team in a single UCL season. Bayern Munich scored 41 goals on the way to lifting their first UEFA Champions League trophy in seven years, back in 2019-20. In a Covid-disrupted season, their 1-0 final win over PSG was both the first to be played behind closed doors and the latest to be played in any season (23 August). Twenty-four of their goals (56%) came in the group stage – only Paris Saint-Germain (25 in 2017-18) have scored more goals in a single group stage campaign. Robert Lewandowski scored 15 of their goals in this season, netting 35% of their total in his 10 appearances. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the competition this season was restructured to have single-leg quarter and semi-finals, meaning that Bayern only played 11 games. Their average goals per game of 3.91 is the most seen by a side in any complete UCL season – had they played the now-standard 13 games that season on the way to their title, they’d have undoubtedly broken the outright goal record in the UCL. Real Madrid sealed their 10th UEFA Champions League crown in 2013-14, achieving ‘La Décima’ by beating Atlético Madrid 4-1 in the final after extra-time. Not only were they the first team to score four times in a UCL final since Milan in 1993-94, but they also ended the season with 41 goals – only two teams have netted more in a single Champions League campaign. Over half (21) of their goals this season came in the knockout stages – more than they scored in the group stage (20). 17 of their goals (41%) were scored by Cristiano Ronaldo, who broke the single-season UCL scoring record – their next best scorer (Gareth Bale) only posted six goals, which was 11 fewer than the Portuguese. Liverpool scored 41 goals on the way to reaching the Champions League final in 2017-18. Fourteen of their goals came in just two of their group stage matches, as they beat Maribor 7-0 away from home before replicating the scoreline at Anfield less than two months later in the rout of Spartak Moscow. Both feature in the biggest wins in UCL history. Overall, only two teams have scored more goals in a single group stage – PSG in 2017-18 (25) and Bayern Munich in 2019-20 (24). Liverpool have only seen three players reach double figures for goals in a single UCL season and all three came in this campaign. The lethal front three of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané all grabbed 10 goals, but it wouldn’t help Liverpool to the title – they eventually lost 3-1 in the final to Real Madrid in Kyiv. Real Madrid won the 2016-17 Champions League with a 4-1 victory in the final over Juventus. It was Cristiano Ronaldo who was the hero, both in the final (with two goals) and overall that season, with a competition-high 12 goals for the Spanish club. The La Liga side saw 54 goals scored in their 13 matches in 2016-17 overall (36 scored, 18 conceded) – the seventh highest tally by a club in a single UCL season. Real Madrid (1999-00)Real Madrid (2000-01)Real Madrid (2001-02)Real Madrid (2011-12)Barcelona (2011-12) Paris Saint-Germain scored 25 group stage goals in the 2017-18 UEFA Champions League, which remains a record tally in a UCL group stage. Nearly half (12) of these goals came against Celtic, who they beat 5-0 away and 7-1 at home. Neymar scored in all but one of their six group stage games, scoring six times and assisting three more, with five of these goal involvements coming against Celtic. Their prolific goalscoring record didn’t help them in the knockout stages, however – they were sent out of the competition in the round of 16 by eventual winners Real Madrid after a 5-2 aggregate defeat. PSG’s tally was only two more than Liverpool that season, who scored 23 in the group stage – the third highest tally behind Bayern Munich’s 24 in 2019-20. Bayern nearly matched their tally in 2021-22, but fell just short (22 goals), while fellow German club Borussia Dortmund’s 21 group stage goals in 2016-17 is the fifth-highest. Enjoy this?

10937,Why Alexis Mac Allister Should Fit Liverpool Like a Glove,"Liverpool have started their midfield rebuild by signing a World Cup winner, but that’s not the only reason why Alexis Mac Allister should suit Jürgen Klopp’s team. This article is an updated version of our May piece ‘Alexis Mac Allister: Is Brighton’s World Cup Winner Ready to Move?’, which you can read here. In July 2000, Liverpool raised some eyebrows when they signed 35-year-old midfielder Gary McAllister from Coventry City. In his first season, McAllister played a key part in Liverpool winning a League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup treble, with Steven Gerrard later crediting the former Leeds United man as having a big role in his own development as a player before working with him as a manager at Rangers and Aston Villa. The Kop adored “Gary Mac” and would sing about how they loved his goals and his “baldy head”. Liverpool’s newest signing does not yet have a “baldy head”, so the lyrics will need amending, but Reds fans now have another Mac Allister to cheer for, two decades on. Alexis Mac Allister has arrived from Brighton and Hove Albion as Jürgen Klopp’s first signing of the summer. It seems Mac Allister was the main man Liverpool turned to after reportedly backing out of a planned move for Real Madrid-bound Borussia Dortmund and England star Jude Bellingham, and it’s understandable why. The 24-year-old was one of the best midfielders in the Premier League this season, and even won the World Cup with Argentina halfway through the campaign. So why did Klopp want to bring him to Merseyside? After a 2021-22 campaign in which only a dramatic final-day Manchester City comeback against Aston Villa and Thibaut Courtois’ career-defining performance for Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League final stopped Liverpool from winning a quadruple, it was something of a surprise to see Klopp’s men plummet to a point where they were mid-table and out of every cup competition by mid-March this time around. A run of improved form towards the end of the 2022-23 campaign took them up to fifth, but it was ultimately a below-par showing. Many blamed the midfield, who seemed to struggle to control games the way they used to and regularly failed to stop opposition players from strolling through the middle, and it seems that’s the area Klopp is most keen on fixing this summer. Liverpool did not compete in many duels as a team, with only Manchester City, Manchester United and, funnily enough, Brighton recording fewer in the Premier League. No team had a worse record when it came to winning said duels, however, with the Reds’ 47.5% success rate putting them bottom of the pile. That was across the whole team, but one player aside, Liverpool’s midfield really seemed to struggle in this area. Of Klopp’s options in the middle, only Thiago Alcântara (57.7%) won a higher percentage of league duels than Mac Allister (57.3%), with no other Liverpool midfielder winning even 50%. Mac Allister has primarily been a more attack-minded player so far in his career but has shown his versatility for club and country. He’s even proven himself to be a potent ball-winner when tasked with doing so. Despite only winning possession 149 times in 33 Premier League games in the 2021-22 season, Mac Allister did so an impressive 64 times in the six league games of 2022-23 for Brighton before manager Graham Potter left for Chelsea, which was the most in the league at that point. It appeared to be a deliberate move from Potter to get more from the player and to make use of his well-roundedness. As the Premier League halted for the World Cup, Mac Allister had recovered possession for his team 124 times in 14 games, still the second most in the league at the time, behind only West Ham United’s Declan Rice (139). Roberto De Zerbi did not immediately revert Mac Allister back to a more attacking role, but he did after the World Cup. In his 21 Premier League appearances after success in Qatar, Mac Allister won possession just 89 times, ranking him 95th in the league in that period, and seeing a reduction per 90 from 8.9 to 4.9. This appeared to be due to a role change rather than a drop in performance, with the graphic below showing how different his touch zones were before and after De Zerbi’s arrival. He also looks after the ball well. There is some irony in the fact that a man whose brother is named Kevin Mac Allister is so adept at preventing opponents from robbing possession. The now former Brighton midfielder does not use toy cars and paint cans tied with string to ward off threats, though (yet). He utilises high-level decision-making and positioning (which Macaulay Culkin’s character also did in Home Alone, to be fair). Something interesting that came out of our initial look at Mac Allister was how similar he is to a player Klopp knows very well: İlkay Gündoğan. Of course, the Germany midfielder is working wonders at Man City these days, but he was once a key part of Klopp’s Borussia Dortmund team. Mac Allister had similar passing accuracy (87.2% to 88.2%) and total carries (390 to 387) to Gündoğan in the Premier League in 2022-23, while both recorded 12 goal involvements each, albeit none of the latter’s eight goals came from the spot, and six of Mac Allister’s 10 did. While it only covers certain statistics, you can see from our player radar comparison below how similar their output was. Of all players in Europe’s top-five leagues, no-one profiled as closely to Mac Allister as Gündoğan (85%). The Argentine is already comfortable playing in a team that sees plenty of the ball – with only City (65.2%) and Liverpool (60.6%) averaging more than Brighton’s 60.5% possession in Premier League games this season. The question remains how Klopp will set up his midfield next season, though, or if he will continue with the experimental formation that saw Trent Alexander-Arnold play a hybrid role between midfield and right-back. Either way, you feel Mac Allister is versatile enough to adapt. The trio of James Milner, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Naby Keïta all exited Anfield at the end of the season, but Mac Allister’s arrival might actually be more of a replacement for someone who left in 2021. There is a belief among some Liverpool fans that a failure to adequately replace Georginio Wijnaldum ultimately led to the decline of the team, despite their success the following season. While certainly not as close to Wijnaldum in style as he is to Gündoğan, Mac Allister does have some similar traits. As mentioned in our original article on Mac Allister last month, when comparing his performances this season to Wijnaldum’s numbers in Liverpool’s 2019-20 title-winning campaign, they both recorded four non-penalty goals and tallied similar carries (12.2 to 12.0) and dribbles attempted per 90 (2.1 to 2.3). However, Mac Allister has better dribble success (65.7% to 53.2%), while he also competed in more duels per 90 (10.7 to 9.1) and enjoyed greater success (57.3% to 47.2%). Mac Allister registered 10 Premier League goals for Brighton in 2022-23, though as already noted, six of those were penalties. That’s not to say this couldn’t come in useful for Liverpool, who saw Mohamed Salah miss two of his four league spot-kicks. Mac Allister could put pressure on the Egyptian to take over responsibilities, though it will likely be quite a fight to convince Salah to step back from these duties. It was not just in the Premier League that Mac Allister showed his abilities. He did so on the biggest stage just a few months ago as he lived the dream that some of the game’s greatest players were never able to. During the 2022 World Cup for Argentina, only Rodrigo De Paul won possession more often for the world champions (42 vs. 40) than Mac Allister. But he was not simply a ball winner for his national side. Only Lionel Messi (17) and Ángel Di María (nine) created more chances from open play than his eight, while he had a better passing accuracy than Chelsea’s £100m+ signing Enzo Fernández (89.0% to 87.6%), proving how comfortable he is in possession in big games. Messi (seven) was the one Argentina player who created as many as his two big chances in Qatar, while only Messi, Di María and Julián Álvarez took as many as his seven non-blocked shots. He also provided the assist for Di María to give Argentina a 2-0 lead in the final against France, showing how effective Mac Allister was on both sides of the ball. How Mac Allister fits will depend on the formation Klopp goes with, but that he is the first player through the door in what’ll likely be a summer of significant investment in the Liverpool midfield suggests he’s the one the manager wanted more than any other, and it’s easy to see why. He may not resemble his near namesake, Gary McAllister, but if he has a similar impact on Liverpool’s midfield to that of the experienced Scot back in 2000-01, the club’s fans will likely take Ally Mac to their hearts just as keenly, “baldy head” or not.

3246,"Fabinho explains ‘Dyson’, ‘Lighthouse’ & ‘Flaco’ nicknames at Liverpool & reveals who gave them to him","Fabinho has made such an impressive impact at Liverpool since completing a transfer from Monaco in 2018 that he now boasts a number of nicknames at Anfield, with the Brazilian revealing what they all mean and who gave them to him. The languid, but fiercely competitive South American has become a mainstay for the Reds as they have savoured Champions League and Premier League glory under Jurgen Klopp, with an ambitious outfit still in the hunt for a historic quadruple this season. As a comforting presence in a holding midfield berth, Fabinho will have a leading role to play for Liverpool over the remainder of the 2021-22 campaign as he continues to cement his legacy on Merseyside and a positive standing in the eyes of his manager and team-mates. Fabinho, who now has three nicknames in the Reds camp, has told UEFA’s official website of the many monikers that he works under: “The first time I heard 'Dyson' was when I heard Jurgen saying it after a match in which I'd defended really well, sweeping up in the middle of the pitch. “The nickname 'the Lighthouse' was given to me by [Reds assistant coach] Pep Lijnders. “The players usually call me 'Flaco'. 'Flaco' means 'Skinny' [in Spanish]. [Virgil van Dijk] started it and now everybody calls me that. Even the coach sometimes calls me that. So, that's the one which is most common here.” Three goals in three games for Fabinho 😍No Salah, no problem 👀 pic.twitter.com/y8dOdT0YIQ Fabinho has taken in another 37 appearances across all competitions this term, taking him beyond 150 for Liverpool, and he is hoping to achieve “big things” before more major silverware is handed out. He has said when asked about his individual goals: “Personally, I want to always stay physically fit and well and have no injuries. That was always a constant in my career until last year, when I had some injuries that unfortunately prevented me from having a good run. “In terms of statistics, I guess they're not supposed to be the most important thing for a player in my role, but it's good when you're able to help your team with assists and goals, so I'm glad I've been scoring and supporting the team in attack. I look forward to continuing to contribute in that area. “Generally, that's it: I want to keep up the good work in defence and, of course, I'm hoping that this translates into good collective stats for the team so we can conquer big things.” While Fabinho considers end product to be a welcome bonus in his game, with seven goals recorded this season, he is happy to contribute in as many areas as possible to the collective cause. Explaining his more obvious strengths, the 28-year-old said: “I receive the ball a lot and I'm involved in the creation process. It's good because I always have the ball, and I'm always very involved in transitions between defence and attack. “I also like the fact that there are plays and movements that I can anticipate to intercept some passes. I like to steal the ball, take the ball from the other team and many times, depending on where you win the ball, you can put a team-mate through into a good attacking position. I think that's what I enjoy doing the most. “Attacking players always grab the headlines because they score goals and have better overall attacking statistics, so it's normal. “The younger fans will always pay greater attention to the ones who score goals, since scoring goals is the best thing about football. I focus on how I can help those players improve their statistics: to score more goals and provide more assists.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fabinho-explains-dyson-lighthouse-flaco-nicknames-liverpool/blt3bfc0258c35e4aa1,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1234,"RB Leipzig vs Bayern Munich: Predictions, tips & betting odds","RB Leipzig face Bayern Munich in the German Super Cup on Saturday evening as the Bavarians aim to continue their domestic dominance. As well as winning each of the last 10 Bundesliga titles, Bayern have lifted the Super Cup trophy in five of the last six years and are favourites to triumph once more against the holders of the German cup. With the game being played at the Red Bull Arena, Leipzig have home advantage although they remain clear outsiders at 14/5 (3.80) to win in 90 minutes with bet365. There is no extra time in the German Super Cup with the match going straight to penalties if it ends as a draw and a stalemate is priced at 11/4 (3.75). Bayern have won each of the last three Bundesliga meetings between these two sides and another success for Julian Nagelsmann's side is offered at 10/11 (1.91). First goal scorer markets are not available for this game. The last four clashes between these two sides have brought 21 goals and while Bayern have enjoyed plenty of success in this fixture, Leipzig have been capable of competing with the country's biggest side. Leipzig have netted in four of their last six matches against their Bavarian rivals and while they are clear outsiders for the game, there could be some value in backing the hosts to at least get on the score sheet. Leipzig averaged over two goals scored per game in the Bundesliga last term, finding the back of the net in both matches against Bayern and backing goals at both ends on Saturday looks like a strong selection. Both teams to score is evidently a highly fancied selection given it is priced at 4/9 (1.44), odds that will attract few investors for a standalone bet. However, combining this bet with a Bayern win sees the odds rise to an appealing 21/10 (3.10). Sky Sports will broadcast coverage of the weekend's German Super Cup, as well as several Bundesliga fixtures throughout the course of the 2022/23 season.

2377,"Who will buy Chelsea? Conor McGregor, Nick Candy & candidates for Abramovich to sell Blues to","Roman Abramovich may have seen his assets frozen by the UK government due to connections with Russian president Vladimir Putin, but Chelsea remain up for sale and a takeover could still go through if the right licenses and guarantees are obtained. With that in mind, a race to secure ownership of Premier League heavyweights - and the current holders of a prestigious Champions League crown - is on, with multi-billion pound bids now in the pipeline. A number of potential stakeholders at Stamford Bridge have emerged as interest builds steadily, from UFC superstars to wealthy supporters of the west London club, but who are those in the running? GOAL takes a look... An avid Chelsea supporter, billionaire property developer Candy has been talking to a group of American investors about forming a consortium to buy the Blues. His £2.5bn ($3.3bn) proposal is said to include plans for a £1.5bn ($2bn) rebuild of Stamford Bridge, while the 49-year-old – who is married to former Neighbours actress Holly Valance – has made it clear that he would look to put fellow fans at the heart of his regime. Candy has told Sky Sports of the reasons for his interest: ""I’ve supported Chelsea since the age of four. My dad was asked to play for Chelsea. I love Chelsea. ""I don’t mind where it ends up, even if it is not with me, as long as it is in safe hands."" The 86-year-old emerged as an early frontrunner after revealing long before Abramovich formally put Chelsea up for sale that he had been offered the chance to invest in the club alongside three other parties. The Swiss – who is said to be worth £4.3bn ($5.6bn) after founding American medical device business Synthes – has claimed that Abramovich will need to lower his asking price in order for a deal to go through. He has said: “Abramovich is currently asking far too much. You know, Chelsea owe him £2 billion. But Chelsea has no money. That means, those who buy Chelsea should compensate Abramovich. “As of today, we don't know the exact selling price. I can well imagine starting at Chelsea with partners. But I have to examine the general conditions first. But what I can already say, I'm definitely not doing something like this alone. If I buy Chelsea, then with a consortium consisting of six to seven investors.” The U.S. tycoon is one of those said to be interested in entering into a partnership with Wyss. The co-founder, chairman and CEO of Eldridge Industries, who has a net worth of £4.72bn ($6.1bn), had two bids for Chelsea knocked back in 2019 and is a huge sports fan after already acquiring stakes in MLB side the Los Angeles Dodgers and NBA heavyweights the LA Lakers. One of the more surprising candidates to have thrown his hat into the ring, the Irish MMA fighter saw his interest piqued once it was announced that Abramovich was looking for a buyer. He tweeted “I wish to explore this, Chelsea” when responding to WhatsApp message in which a contact said: “Chelsea for sale, £3bn. Let's buy it.” McGregor is famously a supporter of Manchester United and has previously expressed interest in wrestling control of the Red Devils from the Glazer family. He has also said that he is interested in getting involved with Scottish Premiership team Celtic. A Turkish businessman that made his £8bn ($10bn) fortune as chairman of AB Group Holding – a company which invests in tourism, cryptocurrency and construction – Bayrak is said to have met with Abramovich to discuss a possible deal. He has, however, cast doubt over whether he would be welcomed to west London, saying: “I think they don't want Turkey to buy the club. Everyone should know that the Republic of Turkey is a very big state. Very serious business people come out of this state, and we exist and will be all over the world.” GOAL has been able to confirm that Broughton has held discussions about playing a role in bids that are being prepared for Chelsea. He was previously involved in the deal that saw Fenway Sports Group bring the disastrous reign of Tom Hicks and George Gillett at Liverpool to an end in 2010. Broughton, who is a former chairman of British Airways, is negotiating with backers about tabling his own offer, although he faces a race against time to generate the funds required to enter the bidding. Another fanatical Chelsea supporter that harbours dreams of taking control of the club he loves. Reuben’s father and uncle – who form part of a £12bn ($15.6bn) business - bought a 10 per cent stake in Newcastle last year when a £300m ($391m) takeover at St James’ Park was completed, but he could head out on his own. A man that boasts the likes of Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton and Boris Johnson among his friendship group could find it difficult to get a green light from the Premier League, though, due to his family ties with top-flight rivals on Tyneside. Another of the bidders to have a redevelopment of Stamford Bridge within their grand plans for Chelsea. An approach from the Middle East is being spearheaded by Mohamed Alkhereiji, who runs Saudi Media and is CEO of the Engineer Holding Group parent company which was founded by his father Abdulelah Alkhereiji. The company turns over more than £1bn ($1.3bn) a year, while Alkhereiji is a Blues supporter and was in attendance during Abramovich’s last visit to Stamford Bridge in November 2021. Despite being a lifelong Manchester United supporter, a man with a £20bn ($26bn) fortune has been a season ticket holder at Chelsea for several years. Ratcliffe – who runs multi-national chemicals company Ineos - is the owner of French side Lille and has admitted to holding talks regarding a deal for the Blues. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: “There was some early exchange but we were a significant way apart on valuations. “The issue with Chelsea is its stadium. We are all getting older and it is a decade of your life to resolve that.” Among the others to have been linked with Chelsea are New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, while there has been talk of Moneyball mogul Billy Beane forming part of a bidding consortium. Jayed Afridi, who owns an automobile company and is CEO of consumer electrics giants Haier Pakistan, has been mooted as another potential bidder, along with Michael Rubin – the owner of sports merchandise group Fanatics, a company worth over £20bn ($26bn). Abramovich is said to have acquired Chelsea for just £140m ($182m) back in 2003, with the club enduring serious financial difficulties at that time. He has pumped considerable funding into the club over the course of a 19-year tenure and said investment has allowed 21 trophies to be secured – with that haul including five Premier League titles and two Champions League crowns. The Russian billionaire was said to have put a £3bn ($4bn) asking price on Chelsea when looking to sell, but questions have been asked of that valuation and he is no longer allowed to profit from any agreement after being sanctioned by the UK government. Anyone looking to do a deal, as the Blues work their way through a testing period off the field, must have best and final offers on the table at Stamford Bridge by Friday March 18.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/who-will-buy-chelsea-conor-mcgregor-nick-candy-candidates/blt2f72d34bd983be1e,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4492,Brentford sign Eriksen on short-term contract as Danish midfielder returns to football after heart problem,"Christian Eriksen, who suffered cardiac arrest at Euro 2020, is back in football at Brentford, with the Bees handing the Danish midfielder a short-term contract to the end of the 2021-22 campaign. The 29-year-old playmaker suffered a serious health scare when representing his country at the European Championships in the summer of 2021 and has, after being fitted with a defibrillator, been away from competitive action since. Regulations in Italy prevented him from linking back up with Inter, with his deal having to be terminated at San Siro, but the former Tottenham star is clear to resume his career in the Premier League. Brentford boss Thomas Frank, who worked with Eriksen in the national youth system of Denmark, told the club's official website: “I am looking forward to working with Christian again. It has been a while since I last coached him, and a lot has happened since then. ""Christian was 16 at the time and has become one of the best midfield players to appear in the Premier League. He has also won trophies all over Europe and become the star of the Danish national team. “We have taken an unbelievable opportunity to bring a world class player to Brentford. He hasn’t trained with a team for seven months but has done a lot of work on his own. He is fit but we will need to get him match fit and I am looking forward to seeing him work with the players and staff to get back towards his highest level. “At his best, Christian has the ability to dictate games of football. He can find the right passes and is a goal threat. He also has very, very good set piece delivery, both from corners and direct free kicks. He is a player you can find with the ball, and he will come up with a solution to the problem in front of him. ""Christian will also bring experience of top level football to the club. I expect him to have an impact in the dressing room and at the training ground.” ✍ Welcome to Brentford, @ChrisEriksen8 👊#BrentfordFC 🐝 #EriksenJoins pic.twitter.com/O8h5WbdUZ2 Phil Giles, Brentford’s director of football, added: “We first discussed the possibility of Christian joining Brentford when we heard that he would be leaving Inter. It is fantastic that he is now with us. “Naturally the process of signing Christian was more elongated than most transfers. I understand that many people will have questions about the process. In order to respect Christian’s medical confidentiality, we won’t be going into any details. ""Brentford fans can rest assured that we have undertaken significant due diligence to ensure that Christian is in the best possible shape to return to competitive football. Now Christian has made the decision to sign for Brentford, all parties want to focus fully on football. “We are sure that Christian will make a big impact at Brentford and on the Premier League between now and the end of the season."" Welcome back to the Premier League, Christian Eriksen 🇩🇰 pic.twitter.com/POsGXahVvl After learning he would be prevented from turning out for Inter again, Eriksen has spent time at a couple of his former clubs in a bid to gain full match fitness. He initially linked up with OB Odense back in his homeland, before moving on to Dutch giants Ajax. Things you absolutely love to see ❤#BrentfordFC #EriksenJoins pic.twitter.com/FhvDlMLAxL Eriksen previously spent six-and-a-half years with Tottenham, making 305 appearances for the north London side and scoring 69 goals. Brentford sit eight points above the Premier League drop zone at present in their first season back in the big time, and will return to action on Saturday when facing Everton in the FA Cup fourth round before a testing trip to Manchester City. Eriksen is unlikely to figure in either of those contests as, despite receiving a Covid-19 vaccination, in order to comply with rules regarding entry to the UK, he will not arrive in west London for a few more days and play no part in training this week.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/brentford-sign-eriksen-on-short-term-contract-as-danish/blteea9b03ed588e4ba,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

""I have been looking for a change of air and a fresh start in a new framework, and I am very much looking forward to contributing to the team.  ""It's clear that I lack a bit of training, but I'm physically in really good shape and fit, so now it's about me to get well into the squad and see if I can earn playing time for the club and contribute to , that we can get some points on the account."" ""Jack needs no further presentation, and he has shown his worth on both club and national teams over the past 10 years,"" said Stig Inge Bjornebye.  ""So when the opportunity arose to get him here to Aarhus, we had no doubt that we would like to pursue it. Jack can contribute with his excellent technique and his gaze for the game and he will give us some extra offensive tools.  ""He is in good physical shape, but of course lacks some combat training. It will probably come, and we look forward to seeing him in the white jersey when he has fallen well into place."" Wilshere rose to prominence in the Arsenal squad following his journey through the Arsenal youth academy. He made his debut for the Gunners in 2008, but his playing time was cut short because of injuries. The England international made almost 200 appearances for the club in all competitions.

6866,Chelsea bidder Pagliuca hints at selling Atalanta majority stake to buy European champions,"Steve Pagliuca, who is one of the bidders in the running to complete a takeover at Chelsea, has hinted that he is ready to sell his majority stake in Serie A side Atalanta so that a path is left clear for power to be seized at Stamford Bridge. With Roman Abramovich looking to part with Premier League heavyweights after seeing his assets frozen by the UK government, a protracted sale saga is beginning to edge towards a close. Pagiluca, along with the other three interested parties still in the running, must have finals bids tabled in west London by Thursday – two days after the Blues take in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final clash with Real Madrid - with the race on to secure ownership of the current European champions. On his efforts to take control at Chelsea, Pagliuca – who co-owns the Boston Celtics basketball team alongside his sizeable stake in Atalanta – has said in a statement: “During this hugely significant week for Chelsea, we would first like to wish Thomas and the Chelsea squad the very best of luck ahead of tonight’s Champions League match against Real Madrid. Having witnessed a great 6-0 win against Southampton last week, I hope to see a comeback for the ages against Real Madrid in the quarter-final second leg. “This process has been a disconcerting time for the football club and fans. Throughout my life and career, my ethos has always been to operate quietly, with integrity, and let my actions and results speak loudly. However, it is imperative to clarify and assure supporters about our bid group and its commitments, to emphasize how seriously we take our potential responsibility to Chelsea. “Our first focus and goal is to make strategic investments to continue competing for championships and trophies. We will support our players and managers to make sure that Chelsea are habitual winners and title contenders, whether in the Premier League, Champions League or the Women’s Super League [the only Super League we intend competing in, for the record]. In addition, we will continue to invest in the youth academy to develop the stars of the future and we would not be in this process if we did not have an exciting and inclusive vision for Chelsea. “Our second focus will be to continue to cherish and preserve the legacy and traditions of the club. In over 20 years of ownership of the Boston Celtics, we have not once considered changing the name, colours, or logo of the club. This is our guarantee to Chelsea fans. “Not only are we committed to remaining at the home of Chelsea, Stamford Bridge, but we are inspired to renovate or redevelop the stadium. Chelsea is a world-class team, in a world-class city, with world-class fans: it deserves a world-class stadium. “Our third focus will be having a significant positive impact in the community. We believe passionately that clubs have a social responsibility, and we will continue to support The Chelsea Foundation and its impressive work in education, health and wellbeing, and diversity and inclusion both locally and globally. Chelsea should be the Pride of London for its on and off-field accomplishments. It has fans all over the world and we will not tolerate bullying, antisemitism, racism, or any other form of hateful speech - and neither should our fans. “Ultimately, fans will see our commitment and, we hope, trust us to stay true to our values on and off the pitch. We understand the responsibilities that come with such an important sporting institution and hold ourselves accountable to the fans. “Later this week, we will submit a substantial and credible bid proposal – one that we expect will meet the respective requirements and regulations of the Premier League, UK Government and UEFA – and we pledge to honour our commitment to credibility and good guardianship of Chelsea Football Club from day one.” Private equity billionaire Pagliuca, who made his fortune at Bain Capital, forms part of a consortium that is eager to inherit the reins at Chelsea from the departing Abramovich. NBA chairman Larry Tanenbaum, who owns a number of North American sports teams, is reported to be involved. Other co-investors are said to be John Burbank, the founder of the San Francisco hedge fund Passport Capital, and Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-bidder-pagliuca-selling-atalanta-majority-stake-buy/blte707f55b469c298c,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

The Uruguayan is likely to start against Crystal Palace this evening, and it is fair to say that, a little over a month into his Reds career, he’s already made quite an impression on Merseyside. “He’s a beast!” assistant manager Pep Lijnders told GOAL recently, and Jurgen Klopp has been similarly impressed by the way the 23-year-old has settled in following his big-money move from Benfica. When you commit such eye-watering sums on a player – Liverpool paid an initial £64 million ($77m) for Nunez, and with add-ons the fee could reach a club-record £85m ($103m) – you expect swift returns, and Nunez’s start has certainly been encouraging in that regard. After emerging from the bench to score against Manchester City in the Community Shield, he repeated the trick at Fulham in his first league appearance, throwing in an assist for Mohamed Salah for good measure. “He feels at home,” Klopp said on Friday, and he has been particularly pleased with the “cool partnership” Nunez and Salah have struck up. “It’s two players who are desperate to score,” he added, “which is very helpful.” Like Salah, Nunez has worked hard for this opportunity, though his rise to prominence has not surprised those who worked with the striker during his formative years.  “Hard work brings good results, and Darwin is a good example of that,” Pedro Emanuel, who coached Nunez at Almeria, tells GOAL. “He has a special formula, if I can say it like this, of skills, mentality, willingness to listen and belief in his own abilities, which means he can become one of the best players around.” Nunez had only just turned 20 when he moved to Almeria, then playing in Spain’s second tier. The fee they paid – around £5m ($6m) – was a big one for a player who had caught the eye playing for Uruguay’s youth teams, but who had managed only four goals in 22 appearances with Penarol in his homeland. “We didn’t buy Darwin because of his goals,” Emanuel explains. “We bought him for his skills, and his potential to do well in our team.“We had scouted South America extensively, and there were three names on our shortlist. Darwin was the one who had the best skills for what we were looking for in a striker. It was his pace, his agility and his movement that made him our choice. “It was an expensive fee for a second division club, but we knew if we were going to invest, it had to be in young and quality players like him.” Almeria’s gamble paid off. Nunez spent just over a year in Andalusia but he made a big impact, scoring 16 goals and earning himself a move to Benfica.  “I got a very good impression the first time I met him,” says Emanuel, who was sacked as manager midway through the campaign, and now coaches Al-Khaleej in Saudi Arabia.  “I remember being surprised by how humble he was. He was just desperate to come to Europe and play, and his attitude on the training pitch meant he immediately connected with his team-mates. ""He always wanted more, from himself and from his team-mates. If he missed a chance or made a bad pass, he was always unhappy. He made a big impression on everyone.” Nunez took a little while to get into Almeria’s team – “he got a muscle injury playing for Uruguay shortly after arriving,” remembers Emanuel – but once he did, he never looked back. “He was young, but he always made an impact, and he improved a lot, especially in terms of his physical conditioning and his last pass. He became stronger and quicker very noticeably.” Almeria, as Emanuel had predicted, earned themselves a tidy profit when Nunez joined Benfica for £20m ($25m) in 2020, and his progress continued apace at Estadio da Luz. “He became one of the best strikers in Europe,” Emanuel says. “He grew a lot physically and in his conditioning. You see now he can handle playing every three days. “He improved a lot in his small movements around the box, inside the box in small spaces and with pressure. He can release himself and create space to shoot at goal. “His connection, reading the game, is a lot better. He knows when to touch and move and use his skills, when he needs to receive long diagonals and get his team up to the final third, and when to come short to support and keep the ball for the team. “What makes him so dangerous is that he always wants to play forward. He never stops working and he is so competitive. “Mentally, he has developed. The weakness I saw when he arrived was that if he missed a chance, he would worry, and it would take him some time to move on. ""We worked on that, and you see the difference in the last two or three years. He has more personality now, as you saw when he came to Liverpool. Silencing the haters with four goals 🤫 pic.twitter.com/z7Xjpss3pF ""He missed a few chances and the pressure came, but what happened? He scored four goals against Leipzig. He carried on, kept believing and working hard, and the rewards came.” Jorge Jesus, who coached Nunez in his first season at Benfica, is on record as saying he will be “world class”, and Emanuel believes he has joined the ideal club if he wants to reach that status. “At Liverpool, I think he will get better and better,” he says. “I believe that when a club like this pays this amount of money, it’s because they think he can make the difference. “With the coach, Jurgen Klopp, he will improve a lot, and he is joining a club that has stability, which can give time to its players to adapt, to know the team and can settle in. “Liverpool obviously has other great strikers, which can only help him, and Darwin can also play from outside to inside, not only as a No.9 or with two strikers. “But with his qualities, and particularly his mentality, I don’t have any doubts. He’s a father now, he has stability in his life, and he is ready to take the next step in his career. ""It’s a challenge for him, but one he is able to succeed in. He won’t let Liverpool down. He never gives up.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/darwin-liverpool-nunez-europe-top-strikers/blt644f820cd0b89b8b,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6985,Why are the world's best NXGN wonderkids flocking to the Bundesliga?,"There is an old adage that says once is a fluke, twice is a coincidence and three times is a trend. Well, what happens when that trend goes way beyond three? What happens when something happens dozens and dozens of times with no sign of stopping? The continued rise of young stars in the Bundesliga is way beyond trend or coincidence. Rather, this rise is based on a mindset, one that has made Germany the home of the world's top footballing talents for the better part a decade. Players from all over the world continue to flock to the country, and it shows no sign of stopping, as new starlets arive every year, hoping to become football's next big name. Gone are some stars of yesteryear, players like Jadon Sancho, Christian Pulisic and Kai Havertz. Soon, we will likely see some, like Erling Haaland, make their own megamoves too. But talent development has become a key part of Germany's football culture, a pillar for a league that continues to do things its own way. One look at the NXGN 2022 list of football's best wonderkids shows Germany's influence on the wonderkid front. Just @BellinghamJude and the NXGN trophy 🏆 pic.twitter.com/EIeaNmTeya This year's award winner, Jude Bellingham, was a player that opted for Borussia Dortmund over Premier League suitors, knowing that a stint in Germany would allow him to reach a different level. Fourth-placed Jamal Musiala made a similar choice, leaving Chelsea, and England, for Germany, joining giants Bayern Munich with hopes of becoming a world-class player. And then there is second-placed Florian Wirtz, a homegrown star of the future whose ranking means that the Bundesliga is currently home to three of the top four teenagers in world football. In total, the Bundesliga is home to five of this year's top 10 NXGN stars, with a further four of the top 50 scattered across German clubs. Of players to have appeared in Europe's 'Big Five' leagues this season, five of the six youngest play in the Bundesliga. Of the eight youngest, only Mathys Tel of Rennes and Luka Romero of Lazio are not plying their trade in Germany. The average age of Bundesliga players this season is just under 26, with France's Ligue 1 the only other league hitting that mark. Seria A's average age is just under 27, with the Premier League and La Liga just over the same number. Once again, this is not a coincidence or a trend. It is the result of a carefully-crafted effort from German clubs, from the top of the league right down to the bottom. Right now, the best example of that effort is Dortmund. Over the last decade, no club has developed talent quite like the Westfalenstadion outfit, allowing them to become the true launching pad of the game's next top stars. ⭐️ JB x JS ⭐️#NXGN pic.twitter.com/3HabGNyeWZ Bellingham, Haaland, Pulisic, Sancho, Ousmane Dembele, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Gio Reyna, Robert Lewandowski... the list goes on and on. All were players brought in from outside of Germany's borders, and all have emerged as stars of the future and, ultimately, the present. That is not an accident, but rather a key part of the club's philosophy. Dortmund are not bank-rolled by a mega-rich owner like Manchester City or Paris Saint-Germain, and nor do they have the money or legacy of clubs like Barcelona, Real Madrid or domestic rivals Bayern. And so their pivot to youth over a decade ago was made partly out of necessity, as they needed to adapt to the ever-changing landscape at the top of the European game. But it was not just about a need, but also a culture. as Dortmund prides itself on being a club that does right by everyone who comes through the door. ""It's part of our DNA that we definitely won't be able to hire the big stars, but that we will educate the young stars, that we will build stars,"" says Dortmund managing director, Carsten Cramer, tells GOAL. ""And if you do this in such a sustainable and credible way for 10-15 years, and if everyone knows that's the only alternative in order to be competitive, I'm very sure that the players think that Dortmund is the right place. ""Another reason for it could be that we are not in a capital city like London or Paris. Dortmund is a calm place. You can take your time. We have an Under-23s team and we have perfect youth coaching as well. ""So even if the players won't make the step into the first team, they know that they will be watched and observed in the second team and then the youth team."" He adds: ""It is still one of our reputations: that Dortmund is one club where young players can make a career, where the club is really concerned and care about the players, but, which is I guess most important, where the players have with, a kind of high probability, a real chance to become part of the squad."" It's not just Dortmund, though, even if they are leading the charge. Top young talent is spread throughout the league, from Musiala at Bayern right to the bottom of the table. Bundesliga representing in the NXGN 2022 list:8. Youssoufa Moukoko4. @JamalMusiala 2. Florian Wirtz1. @BellinghamJude That's 4 ballers in the top 8. Levels 🏆 pic.twitter.com/sF2rfoonkk Just this winter, Augsburg, a team battling relegation, spent €18 million (£15m/$20m) to make Ricardo Pepi the club's record signing. Pepi, who ranks 10th on the NXGN 2022 list, was brought in not just for the future, but for the present as the club battles relegation. It is a lot to pin on a teenager's shoulders, but that sort of thing is routine in a league filled with clubs that have learned how to balance big tests with the right amount of leeway. Like most young stars, Pepi faced a choice. He was wanted by clubs all over the world, but he chose the Bundesliga and, ultimately, a struggling club like Augsburg, because he believed it gave him the best chance to take his game as far as he can in the next few years. Some see it as a move before the move, much like Bellingham's decision to play at Dortmund before likely returning to a top Premier League side, but Pepi believes he can find a home in Germany for the foreseeable future. ""I want to be able to succeed in this league,"" Pepi said in February, ""and it's where everyone wants to come and play. In America, every single player wants to come play in the Bundesliga. ""I wouldn't say it's a stepping stone, but it's a great league to be in. If I stay here for five years, I wouldn't mind playing at this high level."" His point was echoed by another American, Joe Scally, who made the move from NYCFC to Borussia Monchengladbach in 2020, before earning a more regular role in the first team this season. ""They give young players a chance,"" Scally said, reflecting on his own decision to head to Germany. ""If they see them make a mistake, it's not going to wreck your career, you'll get another chance. ""I think that's been shown, that's been proven and, for American players, every single player that has come here as basically has done well for themselves."" For players, the allure of the Bundesliga is obvious. For English speakers like Bellingham, Sancho, Pepi and Scally, it is a country that is very culturally friendly. Most players do learn German, but there is plenty of English spoken around the clubs, making adaptation easier. Like Scally said, the Bundesliga is not a league that is as unforgiving as, say, the Premier League, where the combination of internal and external pressures have ruined many talented players. But it's also no cakewalk, as players will regularly face off with several of the world's top teams. It is just that the league is a bit more welcoming than others at its level. Players are nurtured and not discarded. They are treated like projects that will have ups and downs, not like replaceable pieces on a neverending conveyor belt of transfers. But this approach is also great for the clubs themselves. Players like Dembele, Pulisic and Sancho got their starts in Germany and left Dortmund for massive fees. So too have Premier League stars like Roberto Firmino, Heung-min Son Ibrahima Konate, Naby Keita and Granit Xhaka, all of whom moved to the Bundesliga at a young age before being sold for a massive profit. For many clubs - basically all aside from Bayern - this is the only way of doing business and staying sustainable. Find talent, develop talent, sell talent: that's the easiest way to keep afloat in a sport that constantly pushes the envelope when it comes to spending. The Bundesliga is at a higher level than, say, the Eredivisie, a league that has long been famous for developing attacking talent, in particular. And the Bundesliga has money to spend, just not Premier League money. With that, the league can find a happy medium, bringing in the best young players just before they are actually ready to become stars. ""We have to be a bit more creative. We have to look for other solutions,"" says Cramer. ""We don't have that much money. We are not owned by any investor or owned by any government like some of the Premier League clubs. We have to earn our money by ourselves, which means we don't have that much more money than others, and then you have to be creative. ""It's sometimes easier and, of course, also cheaper to develop young players to stars than to buy stars for a high fee and high salary when they are almost at the end of their career. That's the reason why we decided to choose a different approach. ""We collected the experiences over the last 10 to 15 years that this approach is successful, talking about the sporting targets and not only the business targets. That's the reason that we think it will be the right approach."" There is a third piece to this puzzle aside from the players and the clubs: the coaches. It is the coaches who are truly in charge of a player's development. They pick the line up, design the training sessions and choose who to trust with what and when. If coaches are not on board, if they are constantly fearing for their job or if they decide to put the present over the future, the whole plan crumbles. But German football is littered with coaches that find themselves in a similar scenario to the players they manage. They are often plucked from obscurity and nurtured themselves, with several going on to manage at the top level. It was not so long ago that Jurgen Klopp rose from unknown to one of the top managers in the world in his home country. Thomas Tuchel was once a youth coach charged with developing Mario Gomez and Holger Badstuber. Ralf Rangnick built RB Leipzig and its sister clubs around a system designed to make the most out of young stars. ""I think that the Bundesliga is a very, very competitive league,"" said Stuttgart boss Pellegrino Matarazzo, who manages Wahid Faghir, the 18-year old starlet hailed as the next Zlatan Ibrahimovic who also appears on the NXGN 2022 list. ""There's a good balance between technicality, tactics and physicalness. I think it's a good stage for young players to develop. ""I think it's also important that coaches are bold enough to play young players if they're ready. And I think we see a lot of young coaches as well developing in the Bundesliga who are bold enough to play young players."" Germany's focus on tomorrow's stars is not going anywhere. It is ingrained in the country's football culture, much like cheap tickets, the 50+1 rule, hometown fan culture and beer in the stands. Clubs like Dortmund will continue to set the tone, and players like Bellingham will continue to prove that the Bundesliga is a league where future stars can reach unimagined heights. ""If you see Jude Bellingham representing Dortmund, I would say, not only talking about his abilities in football, I’d say he's a perfect fit for what Dortmund is representing and looking for,"" Cramer concludes. ""That's the reason that I'm convinced that there is no real serious alternative to this approach.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-worlds-best-nxgn-wonderkids-flocking-bundesliga/blt00f900015584223f,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

11094,Brighton and Brentford: Two Smart Clubs Who Play the Game in Opposite Ways,"On 1 April Brighton & Hove Albion will host Brentford in a key Premier League contest when two major schools of thought in modern football will collide – those who prioritise retaining possession and those who prioritise regaining it. Brentford and Brighton are recognised as model clubs, but the most interesting aspect to their respective stories is that they selected very different ways to go about achieving success. Both clubs thought about a potential solution to the same problem – how can you perform at a top-six level with a bottom-six budget – and came up with a different answer. Owners Tony Bloom (Brighton) and Matthew Benham (Brentford) realised, not unreasonably, that they could not match the resources of their rivals – it is very expensive to play like Manchester City. So, if they could not out-spend their opponents, they needed to out-think them. Benham and Bloom made their money by challenging a prevailing orthodoxy in betting markets. Additionally, both recognized that the leading teams across the world share similar ideas about how to play; that pressing has become the new orthodoxy. Logically, a competitive advantage could be gained by trying to do something different; to challenge the prevailing orthodoxy and use the high press against itself. Two clubs, noted for their data-informed approach, crunched the numbers, and produced two distinct ways to maximize their chances of winning. Brentford like to go over the press, Brighton opt to play through it. Is there a right way to play football? No. This is not a battle between idealism and pragmatism, but, instead, a contest between two competing pragmatisms. There are no absolutes. Contrasting styles are not better or worse than each other, or one more worthy than the other. They’re just different. Both clubs have excelled at talent identification and development. There is, however, more to it than that. The hierarchy at both Brighton and Brentford have created aligned organizations: both had a vision for what they wished to achieve and devised a strategy to realize that ambition. Professional football is in thrall to the cult of the individual, but Brighton and Brentford have identified this as flawed thinking. A core reason for their success is that the club’s methods are not concentrated on any one individual. At Brentford and Brighton, the first team manager or head coach performs a role. Both clubs have developed a style of play which is directly related to their identity. This style of play informs the appropriate recruitment of staff and the subsequent development of talent. The role of the head coach is to implement this style. As a result, the club is not head-coach dependent. When Roberto de Zerbi, for example, succeeded Graham Potter, the Italian was plugged in to Brighton, not the other way round. The system and the way of working matters, not the individual. Whether playing in a 4-3-3 or 3-5-2 format, Thomas Frank ensures Brentford defend deep, pack the central spaces, and force the opposition to attack down the flanks. Any subsequent attacking crosses well-suit their aerially-dominant centre-backs (most recently Ethan Pinnock and Ben Mee, the former of who leads all Premier League players for headed clearances per 90 at 4.7) while goalkeeper David Raya loves to advance off his line. Only Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martínez       (1.6) averages more goalkeeper claims than Raya’s 1.5 per 90 minutes. Brentford’s average possession of 43.9% is the sixth-lowest in the league and their predilection to drop off is illustrated by the fact that Frank’s men have registered 25 fewer high turnovers than Brighton (194 versus 219) despite having played two fewer games. In fact, Brentford’s 7.2 high turnovers per game ranks them 17th in the division. Brentford back off, encourage the opponent to come forward and thereby create the conditions for the counterattack. Thomas Frank’s men may well perceive themselves as being better without the ball (more likely to score and less likely to concede). Brentford are ruthless on the counter. The Bees’ direct speed (a measure of the average speed in metres per second of how fast a team moves the ball up the field) is 1.52 (fourth highest) while the fact that Brentford launch 72.3% of their goal kicks is noteworthy (Brighton: 36.3%). In fact, 16.7% of all of Brentford’s passes are long – the highest rate in the league. That contrasts hugely with Brighton’s 8.7% (third-lowest). Ivan Toney is an obvious target for back-to-front deliveries with Bryan Mbeumo particularly adept at timing runs in behind. The fact that Toney has attempted 92 flick-ons this season – 42 more than the next-highest player – and the fact that 14.6% of all his passes are attempted flick-ons (by far the highest share in the league) shows just how often he’s targeted with direct balls. These swift attacks do have not to directly produce goals either, as they can often lead to attacking set pieces, which are particularly valuable given Brentford’s threat at such situations. Brentford are second only to Spurs this season at scoring goals from set pieces (12 non-penalty). In contrast, Brighton share stylistic traits with the division’s elite teams. Without the ball, they are aggressive, push high and look the win the ball back. Their PPDA – how many passes they allow the opposition to have before they engage – of 11.1 is the third-lowest number in the league. In possession, they are very different to Brentford. The Seagulls have registered 399 open-play pass sequences of 10 or more passes, a number comparable to the very best – only Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea have registered more. They’re also very adept at converting these long passing moves into chances. Brighton are third for build-up attacks (open-play sequences which contain 10 or more passes and result in a shot or a touch in the opposition box) with 99. As the graphic below shows, this is something that Brentford do not even try and do. Furthermore, Brighton average 4.1 passes per open-play sequence and keep the ball for over 11 seconds per sequence, the third-longest time in the division. the length of Brighton’s average sequence is 11.01 seconds (third longest), Brentford’s is 7.03 (second shortest). Roberto de Zerbi’s side love to play audaciously deep inside their defensive third with a stated intention to provoke the opposition press, beat the first line and play through. Brighton often opt to build-up in 2-4 shape with goalkeeper Robert Sánchez a willing accomplice in this endeavour. The whole idea is to manipulate the opposition press and then feed a front four. The formation could be described as a 4-2-3-1 with the front four backed up by a double pivot – but with two no. 10s in the side it could not be asserted that de Zerbi plays with a dedicated nine. The 10s like to drop off into midfield either side of the opposition holding midfielder and force the centre-halves to make a decision (follow their men or sit tight in no man’s land). If those centre-backs follow their men, that leaves space for Brighton’s dangerous wide men to run into. Typically, when Brighton break the press a pivot (potentially Moisés Caicedo or Alexis MacAllister) can find Adam Lallana or Evan Ferguson free just inside the opposition half who, in turn, feed an inverted winger (stationed high and wide). Karou Mitoma is right-footed, but features on the left while Solly March is left-footed and plays off the right. Mitoma and March take on their men; the tens attack the box in the subsequent phase. The technical skill littered amongst Brighton’s squad means they can invite the opposition press and feel comfortable beating it. As a team, they have completed more line-breaking passes in their own half than any other side in the league, while 13.9% of their passes across the pitch are line-breaking – a tally only Arsenal (14.6%) can better. And chief among Brighton’s line-breakers is central defender Lewis Dunk. The Englishman has completed 244 line-breaking passes in his own half, a full 42 more than the next nearest player (Tim Ream), and he has broken the opposition’s attacking line more often than any other player in the division. An example from Brighton’s home win against West Ham can bring all these points together. Dunk, seeing that his immediate passing options are blocked off, fizzes a ball into the feet of Evan Ferguson, breaking both West Ham’s first line and second line. Ferguson holds the ball up excellently. Before laying it off to one of Brighton’s double pivot – in this case, Caicedo. Who pushes the ball quickly onto MacAllister, who then quickly feeds Brighton’s winger, Mitoma who can attack his opposite number. In the overall attacking metrics, Brighton are outperforming their opponents on Saturday. They’re averaging more non-penalty goals per game (1.5 to 1.3), creating more non-penalty xG (1.6 to 1.3), and generating more shots per game (14.4 versus 10.3); but Brentford’s average xG per shot created is higher (0.13 versus 0.11). When the sides met on 14 October earlier in the season, Brighton owned the game, dominated the shot count 21-7 and enjoyed 72% of the ball. Brighton, of course, lost 2-0. Brentford sat in and caught Roberto de Zerbi’s side on the break. A similar pattern is likely on this occasion, but it will be fascinating in its own way since Brighton have developed significantly since then – six months ago Pascal Groß and Danny Welbeck started up front in a 4-4-2, but now Brighton feature break-out stars in Ferguson and Mitoma. The Moneyball tag is not one that Tony Bloom and Matthew Benham welcome, but should accept the analogy as a compliment. The way in which Brighton and Brentford have challenged the concept that professional football is a rich man’s game (whereby only those who spend big can hope to achieve) is genuinely refreshing. Brighton and Brentford have transformed their fortunes by placing data at the centre of their respective organisations and by seeking out a smart(er) way to operate. The hierarchy at both Brighton and Brentford have created a space where elite sports people and ideas can meet. To unlock hidden potential, you must abandon fixed ideas. Prevailing orthodoxy should be seen as something to be persistently challenged. There is always a better way to do something. You must be open to counter-intuitive ways of looking at things; reinvention is key to the new frontier and a metaphor for a life lived well. Ironically, Tony Bloom and Matthew Benham are professional gamblers. In contrast to the caricature, accomplished gamblers strip out all emotion and base their approach on rationality. The opposite, of course, is generally true in football clubs. If many of those entrusted to run Premier League clubs applied a similar strategy to the betting exchanges, they would soon find themselves bankrupt. These clubs know how to think.

5650,'We need it more than Chelsea!' - Lampard hopes Blues supporters understand excitement after Everton's season-altering win,"Frank Lampard hopes Chelsea understand his celebrations after Everton beat his former club 1-0 to secure a vital win in their battle against relegation, saying his current employers needed the points more. Richarlison capitalised on an error from Cesar Azpilicueta to score the only goal at the start of the second half as 18th-placed Everton narrowed the gap on Leeds and Burnley above them to two points. Lampard’s status as a Chelsea legend is secure after scoring a club-record 211 goals over 13 years in west London, but that did not stop him wildly celebrating the victory at full time. Speaking about his relationship with his former club, Lampard told Sky Sports: “I have so much respect for Chelsea and the fans. So I hope they understand me getting excited with the win. “We needed it today, more than them. I have to be honest. For me, it was all about Everton today. Three points are so critical to us, when you see what it means to our fans’ lives.” Look at what it means to Frank Lampard! 💪A HUGE win for Everton in their fight against relegation 🔵 pic.twitter.com/CBBHmL7Mta Everton were given a rapturous welcome by the fans, who had gathered outside Goodison Park several hours before kick-off to welcome the team coach before providing a boisterous atmosphere during the game. Lampard has won six of his nine matches in charge at Goodison in all competitions and he believes the backing of the home support will prove vital if they are to continue that form and avoid relegation. “The fans are in the middle of this. I am pleased the players could see on the way in what it means to the fans,"" he said. “They know that and understand it. They got behind us, were nicely aggressive, this place has to be a hard place to come. Results have been good here at Goodison before I came, we have to maintain that. “We have to fight for points, we are in the relegation zone and we have to go with that same spirit every game. “They [the players] have to show they care. I like that. They don’t have to go over the line but have to show they care, the fans want to see that. I prodded them a bit before the game because the situation is clear. We need to perform with that level in all our remaining games. That needs to keep coming in and if it doesn’t we have to sort it out.” After battling for 90 minutes Lampard and Everton had to wait a bit longer to celebrate the win, with referee Kevin Friend adding on seven minutes' stoppage time at the end of the game “Seven minutes added on was a bit of a surprise!” added Lampard. ""They are always a team that will put you under pressure late on. We did brilliantly. The team, stadium, the fans were man of the match today. From the drive in to the support, which we need. Thanks to them.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-lampard-hopes-blues-supporters-understand-excitement/blt807e2d184a7b8232,Tom Mallows,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2366,FAZ’s Kamanga: Zambia can honour 1993 Gabon plane crash victims at Afcon 2023,"Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) president, Andrew Kamanga, has explained how the country can honour the victims of the 1993 plane crash in Gabon. 29 years ago, a tragedy befell Chipolopolo, who were on their way to Senegal for a 1994 World Cup qualifier when their plane came down, killing 30 people on board. Kamanga led a low-key commemoration of the 29th Gabon Memorial Anniversary at Heroes Acre on Thursday and said the only way to celebrate the players who died is to make sure the country has a successful campaign in the next Africa Cup of Nations, which will be held in Ivory Coast in 2023. ""It will be a befitting gift to the fallen heroes if we can remember them with victory in 2023 but first, we need to qualify then we can think about how far we can go in the tournament. The 2023 Africa Cup will be a special moment because it will be 30 years since the heroes died,"" Kamanga said. ""We cannot over-emphasize the role the heroes played. They sacrificed a lot, and they paid the ultimate price with their lives on national duty. ""Next year is going to be a big celebration. We hope we can organize some international game around the event."" Zambia are in Group H of the qualifiers which also has Ivory Coast – the hosts - Comoros and Lesotho. Eighteen players, technical staff, FAZ president, crew, and government officials died on April 28, 1993, when a Zambia Air Force plane taking them to Dakar for a USA 1994 World Cup qualifier crashed off the coast of Gabon.

1317,Barcelona agree €50m transfer for Lewandowski as Kahn admits Bayern Munich are prepared to sell,"Barcelona have finally reached an agreement with Bayern Munich that will see them sign Robert Lewandowski for a reported €50 million (£42m/$50m). The prolific Poland striker has been a top target for Barca since the spring, when it first emerged that he could be looking to leave the German champions. Bayern have stood firm with their demands for the two-time winner of the FIFA The Best award, with there still 12 months left to run on his contract at the Allianz Arena, but a deal has now been put in place that suits all parties. Bayern CEO Oliver Kahn told Bild: “In the end, Barcelona offered a sum that selling him made absolute sense for us. “We've also recently been very successful on the transfer market and signed an absolutely world-class player for the offence in Sadio Mane. So we have now reached an agreement with Barcelona. So far, however, only verbally, the contract is still pending.” Robert Lewandowski has spoken 💔 pic.twitter.com/LSR5NehgTQ Bayern then published an update on their website about the deal with Barcelona, with Kahn saying: ""We know very well what we have to thank Robert for, but great players have also left FC Bayern in the past, and even after that, Bayern's world did not fall apart. On the contrary, it often continued with even more success."" President Herbert Hainer said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: ""It's good for both sides that we have clarity. Robert has earned our appreciation, he has won everything with us. We are incredibly grateful to him."" Sports director Hasan Salihamidzic told the Bayern website: ""Robert Lewandowski has done great things for FC Bayern. We spoke at length with our colleagues from Barcelona and clarified the details. He said farewell this morning.  ""After our trip to the USA, he'll come back one more time and we'll have a coffee together. We wish him every success at his new club."" That contract has seemingly been agreed between Lewandowski and Barca, with the striker set to sign on for an initial three years in Catalunya. The deal to take him to Barca will see the Spanish side pay an initial €45m, with €5m due in potential add-ons. The Blaugrana already have plenty of firepower in their ranks, with summer signing Raphinha joining an attacking unit that includes Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Ansu Fati and Ferran Torres. Barca are, however, forever in the market for the best talent available and an opportunity to acquire Lewandowski is too good to pass up. He may now be 33 years of age, but he remains one of the most fearsome frontmen on the planet. A remarkable strike rate at Bayern has seen him plunder 344 goals through 375 appearances, while playing a leading role in eight Bundesliga title triumphs and a Champions League win. That considerable experience is now set to be added to the ranks at Camp Nou, with Xavi preparing to work with another all-time great. Barca are preparing to head to America for the start of their pre-season programme, with Lewandowski set to join them there once the formalities of his move have been completed.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-50m-transfer-lewandowski-kahn-bayern-munich-sell/blt945ec3d0d9569981,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3087,Chelsea takeover: Ricketts family withdraw bid to leave three parties in the running,"The Ricketts family-led consortium which had been one of the favoured bidders to buy Chelsea has announced it will be withdrawing from the takeover battle at Stamford Bridge. The consortium, headed by the family who already own the Chicago Cubs baseball team in the United States, had partnered with U.S. billionaires Ken Griffin and Dan Gilbert in efforts to seize control in west London from the departing Roman Abramovich. Those plans have now been shelved, with suggestions those involved in the bid have been unable to decide on the final make up of any deal. The consortium said in a statement released on Friday: “The Ricketts-Griffin-Gilbert Group has decided, after careful consideration, not to submit a final bid for Chelsea FC. “In the process of finalising their proposal, it became increasingly clear that certain issues could not be addressed given the unusual dynamics around the sales process. “We have great admiration for Chelsea and its fans, and we wish the new owners well.” Final offers for Chelsea had to be on the table and passed to the Raine Group, the bank handling the sale of the Premier League heavyweights, on Thursday. With the Ricketts family – who had faced protests against their bid - out of the running, three parties remain in the race. Steve Pagliuca, Sir Martin Broughton and Todd Boehly are now battling for ownership of the Blues. “The Ricketts pulling out might seem like they've succumbed to pressure from sections of the fan base over their bid but sources suggest that wasn't the reason. “In fact, they had successfully managed to get some of the match-going support onside through several meetings. “Them pulling out at the final hour is a big surprise but owes more to them not being able to agree on a deal amongst the various billionaires Ricketts-Griffin-Gilbert about how much they own and what they put in.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-takeover-ricketts-family-withdraw-bid/bltd560c9af1014b606,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
661,Caf Confederation Cup: ‘Orlando Pirates lost a final they shouldn’t have against RS Berkane’ – Ncikazi,"Orlando Pirates co-coach Mandla Ncikazi believes his side deserved to win the Caf Confederation Cup final against RS Berkane in normal time because of the chances they created at Godswill Akpabio Stadium in Uyo, Nigeria on Friday. The Buccaneers suffered heartbreak for the second time in the same competition after they lost 5-4 on penalties following a 1-1 draw in normal and extra-time. After the game ended 0-0 in normal time, it was Berkane, who were awarded a penalty in the fourth minute of extra-time and it allowed Youssef El Fahli to break the deadlock. However, the South African side responded when Thembinkosi Lorch levelled matters, ensuring the match went into a penalty shootout. It was Lorch, who missed the decisive kick for Pirates as they lost in the final. Ahead of the final, Pirates were looking to make things right, since they had lost at the same stage in the 2015 final against Tunisia’s Etoile du Sahel in a two-legged tie. “I’m very sad for our team. We lost the final and we lost a match that we shouldn’t have lost,” Ncikazi told the media after the game as quoted by Idiski Times. “It’s a match that we should’ve won in normal time – the story of our season: you create so many chances, you dominate the match, you just don’t do what’s most important, putting the ball in the net.” The 53-year-old South African coach admitted he was feeling for the players since they had put in a brave fight but ended up losing on penalties. “I feel for the players because they fought very hard, I feel for the team. It is what is right now, we can’t change it,” Ncikazi continued. “The disappointing part is that it is a final we shouldn’t have lost based on the dominance and the creation of chances that created, but football is like that, if you don’t convert the chances you create, this is the outcome.” Pirates reached their second final after a 2-1 aggregate result against Al Ahli Tripoli of Libya while Berkane, qualified for the final stage after securing a 4-2 aggregate win against TP Mazembe of the Democratic Republic of Congo.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/caf-confederation-cup-orlando-pirates-lost-a-final-they/blt5853776362dd65e0,Dennis Mabuka,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8496,Norwich City 2-1 Coventry City: Canaries hit back for victory over 10-player Sky Blues,"A late strike from Borja Sainz saw Norwich come from behind to beat Coventry 2-1 in an entertaining Championship clash at Carrow Road. The Spanish winger produced a neat finish in the 84th minute to condemn the 10-man Sky Blues to their first defeat in 13 matches. Mark Robins' side had gone ahead early in the second half through Callum O'Hare's well-taken goal, only to be pegged back 12 minutes later through Josh Sargent's close-range finish. The game turned again with 19 minutes remaining when Liam Kitching was sent off for bringing down Sargent as he burst into the box, with Norwich going on to make their extra man tell to move level with their opponents in the play-off race. Norwich had marginally the better of a competitive first half which featured plenty of neat passing football but with little end product. Coventry goalkeeper Bradley Collins did well to push away an early shot from Christian Fassnacht that was heading for the bottom corner before Sargent steered the ball wide from a good position under pressure from a visiting defender. The sides tended to cancel each other out as the half progressed, with both keepers largely untested. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports But Coventry also posed a threat, with the lively Haji Wright bringing out a decent save from Angus Gunn at the near post after trying his luck from a tight angle. The Sky Blues made their first opportunity of the second period count, however, with O'Hare's fine individual goal making it 1-0 in the 48th minute. Norwich put themselves under pressure with a poor throw and Victor Torp slipped the ball through to O'Hare, who skipped past a couple of defenders before slipping the ball past Gunn. The Norwich keeper then did well to foil a fast-breaking Wright as the Sky Blues sought to press home their advantage but the hosts hit back on the hour mark to level the scores. Recently-introduced substitute Ashley Barnes saw his shot from a Gabriel Sara cross blocked but the ball fell nicely for Sargent to volley home his sixth goal of an injury-hit campaign. Norwich were now on the front foot and received a further boost on 71 minutes when Kitching was shown a straight red card for bringing down Sargent on the edge of the box when he was the final defender. Sara clipped the crossbar from the ensuing free-kick. Coventry substitute Kasey Palmer was then denied by an excellent reaction save from Gunn but Norwich kept pressing and got their noses in front for the first time on 84 minutes. The goal came after a break down the left, with Sainz exchanging passes with Barnes on the edge of the box before curling a delightful shot past Collins and into the far corner of the net. Norwich's David Wagner: ""I thought it was a fantastic afternoon, both with the result and the performance which I also thought was top class, especially in the first half. ""We didn't get the goal we deserved and then went behind early in the second half with a goal that was avoidable from our point of view. ""But the players reacted well and to come back from 1-0 down to win 2-1 against a top side like Coventry is a fantastic achievement. ""It was good the players from the bench made an impact and that's how it should be. We have a competitive group so when we lose our top scorer (Jon Rowe who missed the game with a hand injury) we can cope. ""It's another good step in the right direction and we now look forward to the next challenge at QPR next Saturday."" Coventry's Mark Robins: ""I can't help feeling hard done by after that - we played some decent football out there and to come away with nothing was bitterly disappointing. ""There's no doubt the red card changed the game - at that point I felt we had a good chance to go and win it. ""We were still in it with 10 men but Norwich have a lot of quality and they punished us in the end. ""In the end I think it comes down to taking chances - we scored a good goal and then Haji Wright has had an excellent chance to make it 2-0 and I think it would have been game over then, red card or not. ""The keeper has made a save but he shouldn't have had that chance. Kasey (Palmer) has also had a great chance at 1-1 but the keeper has saved again. ""It is a disappointing result and we also lose Liam Kitching for a couple of games now as it was his second sending off while Ben Sheaf is out for six-to-eight weeks. ""But we just have to take this on the chin - the games are coming thick and fast now and there are plenty of other good players in the building.""

22,Zambia’s Mwepu ruled out of Brighton & Hove Albion fixture against Leeds United,"Brighton & Hove Albion manager Graham Potter has confirmed midfielder Enock Mwepu will not be involved when they take on Leeds United in a Premier League fixture on Sunday. The Seagulls will travel for their second last fixture of the season against Leeds at Elland Road before they complete the season with a home game against West Ham United on May 22. Ahead of the fixture, Potter revealed a detailed injury update on his squad and confirmed that the Zambia captain will not be involved against Leeds despite returning to training. “Enock [Mwepu] did a little bit with the group, but this weekend’s game is still a little bit too soon,” Potter said in his press conference on Friday as quoted by the club’s official website.  “We’re in the same position as we were against Manchester United in terms of selection.” Since joining Brighton from Austrian club RB Salzburg at the start of the season, the 24-year-old has struggled with injuries that have kept him out of several matches. His last appearance came in the 3-0 defeat against Manchester City on April 20, and he has gone ahead to miss three straight matches – the 2-2 draw against Southampton, 3-0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers, and their recent 4-0 thumping of Manchester United. On May 10, Mwepu’s goal against Liverpool in the 2-2 draw at Anfield was voted the Goal of the Season by the club's fans.  In a recent interview, Mwepu admitted he us praying hard to have a free-injury season in the next campaign. “It’s not easy to come to a new country, with a new language and the weather is not so good,” Mwepu said.  “My family have always been supporting me so I am really grateful to them. “The fans have made it even easier with the support they have given me this season. They have been phenomenal and I have so much I owe them. ""I can only pray that next season I am fit to be consistent the whole season. You never know what I can achieve.  ""I want to be an important player for the team so that is my goal.” Mwepu’s second goal of the season came against Arsenal in the 2-1 victory at Emirates Stadium on April 9.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/zambia-mwepu-ruled-out-of-brighton-and-hove-albion-fixture/bltb4b0a17cbb5ba091,Dennis Mabuka,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

3316,"Messi, Mikel, Taiwo: Why did Taye not realise his potential?","When the individual awards were being handed out after Argentina’s 2-1 win over Nigeria at the 2005 U-20 World Cup final, three players stood out: the diminutive Lionel Messi, gangly Mikel John Obi and Taye Taiwo. The South Americans owed their triumph to the mesmeric magician whose six-goal haul brought home the nation’s fourth success in six tournaments, while the disappointed pair on the losing side couldn’t record the West African country’s first win at the showpiece. Mikel, for his part, was probably the most talented of that iteration of the Flying Eaglets, with his artistry putting him above many in the squad. He came second behind Messi, and there was a peculiar choice for third-place. It’s often trite to place stereotypes on players of colour, but Taiwo was the emodiment of those 'classic African' qualities of pace, strength and power. The left-back wasn’t just a bystander in Samson Siasia’s side; he indefatigably forayed forward, often contributing in making the side tick in the final third and balanced it with defensive astuteness. The stocky defender’s influence grew as the African side progressed in the competition, leading to his two strikes in the knockout stages. His first was a fortuitous cross-cum-shot with his weaker foot that won the game against Ukraine in the Round of 16, while the second, a typical powered effort, was the opener in the Eaglets’ comfortable 3-0 semi-final success over Morocco. Furthermore, the confidence and composure to step up and dispatch both his penalties in the dramatic 10-9 shootout success over tournament hosts the Netherlands underlined his admirable self-belief and calmness. He was also involved in the move that ended with Chinedu Obasi’s fine diving header to peg back Argentina in the decider. Taiwo was that side’s second highest scorer (Obasi netted three times) and seemed ready to take on the world, as Mikel and Messi would go on to do. Unsurprisingly, the defender’s showings at the biennial competition translated into increased game time at Olympique de Marseille in 2005/06. Having featured in only four Ligue 1 matches the year before, new boss Jean Fernandez made the Nigerian defender his primary left-back for the new season, resulting in 30 league matches. Appearances in the following campaigns were 37, 28, 35, 27 and 30 before his departure after the 2010/11 season. What made Taiwo’s time in France extra special was playing a major part in Les Olympiens’ return to the summit of Ligue 1 in 2010, ending an 18-year wait for the title. The left-back was largely backed as first-choice pick despite the managerial changes at the time – Fernandez, Albert Emon and Eric Gerets were at the helm between 2005 and 2009 before Didier Deschamps’ appointment under the late Senegalese president Pape Diouf. Despite the 1998 World Cup-winning captain signing 10 players in the summer of 2009, Gabriel Heinze inclusive (who intermittently featured at left-back), the powerful Super Eagles star remained a vital cog of the side. He also featured for 90 minutes in Marseille’s 3-1 Coupe de la Ligue Final win over Bordeaux – ending ‎Les Phoceens’ 17-year trophy drought – which came about two months before their ninth top flight success. While players like Mamadou Niang (the club’s top scorer), Brandao, Mathieu Valbuena and Lucho Gonzalez (a then-record buy) got most of the plaudits, the input of blue-collar workers like Taiwo was also critical to their success. The left-back’s final year saw Marseille retain their cup title but surrender their Ligue 1 crown to LOSC Lille. In truth, departing Stade Velodrome having helped the club to league success and successive cup titles seemed like the smart move, especially as AC Milan, Bayern Munich and Liverpool were supposedly interested in his services. After seven years in Marseille, 26 seemed like a good age to seek a new challenge and he opted for Milan who had won the Serie A in 2010/11. However, this proved to be the turning point of Taiwo's career. Massimiliano Allegri preferred Luca Antonini or Gianluca Zambrotta at left-back for the first-half of 11/12, and oddly even opted for Daniele Bonera, naturally a centre-back, in a game at Napoli with the Nigerian defender on the bench. After months without regular action, the former Marseille man blew his top in an interview with L'Equipe in December 2011. ""I am suffering every day because I don't get to play football. I joined this club in order to play, but I have made only six appearances so far,"" Taiwo bemoaned. ""I don't understand how things work in Italy. Sometimes I even have to watch from the stands, but I really need to play in order to show what I can do. ""It looks like Allegri doesn't have faith in me. It's not like me to just sit back and do nothing in a situation like this."" He also admitted later to having issues with the language, not helped by the coach’s rapid speech. Allegri started the stout defender in the Rossoneri’s next two fixtures – 2-0 wins over Siena and Cagliari – but they proved to be the West African’s last games for Milan (he appeared only four times in Serie A and made four Champions League appearances). Taiwo was loaned to relegation-threatened Premier League Queens Park Rangers in January 2012, a major step down for a player used to competing for things at the top of the table. That short spell in England proved to be the left-back’s last sighting in one of Europe’s major leagues; he had a year-long spell at Dynamo Kyiv, played in Turkey with Bursaspor and turned out for Finnish outfit HJK Helsinki, to name a few. The ex-Marseille man also played in Switzerland and Sweden prior to a two-year stay at RoPS where he stayed till his release at the end of 2019. For a career that promised so much, the notion is that the 34-year-old peaked early and couldn’t continue his upward trajectory after his initial burst of success. Somewhere, this evening, Taye Taiwo was listening to the radio...""..and Elderson's replacement will be...""...big smile...""Uzoenyi""..sad face Yet, one wonders how things might have panned out if he either moved elsewhere in 2011 or that ill-fated spell at Milan had gone differently. At international level, it is poignant that Mikel was the only one from that 2005 Eaglets squad to indeed stay relevant for an extended period. The ex-Chelsea man was also the only one who featured in Nigeria’s 2013 Africa Cup of Nations success, ending nearly two decades of hurt, withTaiwo having been discarded from the national team a year earlier. While Mikel became a cornerstone of the Super Eagles side, the left-back unfortunately faded following his promising time in France which turned out to be the highpoint of his career.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/taye-taiwo-where-did-it-all-go-wrong/blte6c88e9d6982ff59,Seye Omidiora,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

2538,Fernandes calls out 'bad journalism' as Man Utd star responds to Barcelona transfer links,"Manchester United star Bruno Fernandes has called out reports linking him with a transfer to Barcelona as ""bad journalism"". Fernandes quickly became a talismanic figure at Old Trafford following his move from Sporting CP in January 2020, but has suffered a major dip in form in the first half of the 2021-22 campaign.

Portuguese outlet SPORT TV has reported that Fernandes has been offered to Barca as his representatives seek to broker a January transfer for the midfielder. However, Fernandes has come out to set the record straight in a direct response to the post on Instagram, telling his followers: ""And I thought the new year only started a few days ago, yet we’re already on April 1!

Fernandes recorded 40 goals and 29 assists across his first one-and-a-half seasons with the Red Devils, helping them finish second in the Premier League and reach a Europa League final in the process. However, the Portugal international has just five goals and nine assists to his name from 24 outings so far this term and seems to have lost his clinical edge in the final third of the pitch. Supporters will hope that interim manager Ralf Rangnick can start to bring the best out of Fernandes again sooner rather than later, with his next chance to shine likely to come when United take on Aston Villa in the third round of the FA Cup on Monday.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fernandes-bad-journalism-man-utd-responds-barcelona-transfer/blt621073773fb13ba2,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2522,USMNT drop Pulisic to bench for World Cup qualifier against Honduras,"Christian Pulisic has been dropped to the bench along with full back Sergino Dest for the United States men's national team's World Cup qualifier against Honduras on Wednesday. Pulisic started the USMNT's previous two games this international window but struggled to make an impact. Attacker Jordan Morris was named in the first-team for Wednesday for his first start in World Cup qualifying since 2017 with Cannon brought in to replace Dest in the starting XI. There was no announcement before the game that Pulisic was carrying a knock, though he has dealt with an ankle problem this year. Asked to clarify the situation after the game, manager Gregg Berhalter said: ""I felt it was a decision that was made to put him in the best possible position to make the impact that we know he can make. ""You know, it's never easy. When you're a player, high profile player, and you're not in the form of your life, and that those things are very hard to always capture, especially when you're a club like Chelsea, but he's a guy that means a heck of a lot to this team. He's one of the top performance team over this stretch of time, and he's going to be a huge contributor to what we do moving forward. That's for sure."" Pulisic came on in the 64th minute as a substitute, replacing Morris, and scored the USMNT's third goal moments later. Christian Pulisic comes off the bench to score for the United States 💪(🎥: @USMNT)pic.twitter.com/GAoiEQug1H It's been a frustrating few months for Pulisic, who has been used at wing-back when he plays for Chelsea and has not managed to find his top form for the USMNT. However, his compatriots still have his back. ""All of us have had our ups and downs, all of us have had difficult times, and the most important thing is that we're there for each other and obviously, with the situation that [Pulisic] is in, maybe the amount of playing time that's involved, it's just catching his footing again and building his confidence,"" said midfielder Weston McKennie this week. ""I think, in general, he is still an important piece because he's one of those types of players that might have one spark in a game, he could maybe not do anything all game, and then have one spark. He's one of the players that are very unpredictable to the opponents and I think he's just someone that adds another type of dangerous and one-on-one ability in the final third.""

7442,"Pulisic, McKennie and the winners and losers of the USMNT's first World Cup qualifiers of 2022","Just three games stand between the United States men's national team and the 2022 World Cup. Just one more window in this chaotic sprint towards Qatar, one more camp that will determine whether or not the U.S. returns to the game's biggest tournament for the first time in eight years. And, after this week's three-game set, the U.S. controls their own destiny. They sit second in CONCACAF qualifying, knowing that two results in March will secure their spot. Getting to that point, though, was anything but straightforward, as the U.S. endured yet another up-and-down window. It has been a familiar pattern: a good first game, a bad second one and a fantastic third to send everyone home happy. The U.S. followed that formula yet again this time around by edging El Salvador, falling to Canada and then battering Honduras in the frozen Minnesota weather. With that said, GOAL takes a look at the biggest winners and losers of the USMNT's penultimate window of World Cup qualifying... There is no doubt who was this window's MVP: Weston McKennie. The Juventus midfielder was incredible for the U.S. across the three games, most notably against Honduras. McKennie was surgical in picking apart the opposition on Wednesday, helping the U.S. dominate the midfield despite the absence of Tyler Adams. To go with that midfield dominance, McKennie also scored a much-needed goal, giving the U.S. an early lead in the frigid temperatures. That strike allowed the U.S. to exhale a bit while sucking a bit of energy out of a Honduras team that was in Minnesota with nothing to play for. McKennie was one of the few players to put in a decent performance against Canada, giving the U.S. their best chance at a goal in the 2-0 loss, and was also one of several standouts in the win over El Salvador. Overall, a great window from a player that seemingly reaches a new level every week as he continues to grow for both club and country. ""He's a guy that that leads by his performance,"" Berhalter said. ""I thought I thought he had an outstanding window. ""I thought is what you could tell that is that he's in big, big form with Juventus with the way he came into this window and he's dominant. ""I think he's one of the best midfielders in this region, if not the best, so it's great to have a strong performance from Weston. We've almost come to expect that from him."" It is a bit harsh to label Matt Turner as one of this window's losers, but such is life for a goalkeeper. Turner had one real bad sequence against Canada, his first truly bad sequence in a USMNT shirt, and it proved costly. He hit a poor goal-kick into the wind and was unable to stop a potentially-saveable shot from Cyle Larin from the attack that followed. Now, that moment was not exclusively on Turner. The defenders in front of him, namely Miles Robinson, did not cover themselves in glory either. But as a goalkeeper, you cannot make mistakes, as when you do, they prove costly. Unfortunately for Turner, he was not tested enough against El Salvador or Honduras to overshadow that mistake. And so the lasting images of Turner this window will be that goal (and the videos of how cold he was against Honduras). That is not ideal for a player battling Zack Steffen to be the USMNT's No.1. That battle still hs a long way to go, and Turner very well could win it, but with Steffen on the shelf, this was an opportunity for Turner to assert himself as the No. 1. He did not take it, and so that battle rolls on. Speaking of taking an opportunity, we have to talk about Luca de la Torre. The Heracles midfielder was spectacular in midfield against Honduras, making the most of his opporutnity to impress Berhalter. And impress Berhalter he did, as the USMNT boss selected De la Torre as his Man of the Match. Starting alongside McKennie and Kellyn Acosta, two other MOTM candidates, De la Torre was smooth as silk, showing off the ability to drive the ball forward that has made him one of the Eredivisie's best midfielders. After struggling to break through at Fulham, De la Torres is now growing rapidly in the Netherlands, evolving into a midfielder that is fantastic on the ball and has an incredible work-rate when he is forced off of it. So where does that put him? As things stand, McKennie, Adams and Yunus Musah are the starting midfield, with Acosta as Adams' primary backup (which was only reinforced with a magnificent performance against Honduras). But after that, De la Torre might just be the guy, with this performance being more than enough to vault him ahead of Sebastian Lletget and Cristian Roldan. In De la Torre, the U.S. have a solid Musah replacement: a player that can drive the ball forward with energy. That's a valuable thing. ""This was a really big opportunity for me,"" he said after the game. ""In some ways, I've worked my whole life for this."" Look for De la Torre to have a bigger role going forward after being left out of the squad in earlier windows. Performances like this are the ones that make you a national team mainstay, a title De la Torre hopes to earn going forward. Three games from three different strikers. No goals. The problems at the No. 9 position have been discussed at length, and it was another window where the U.S. did not quite get the production they needed up top. Jesus Ferreira started the first game, with the young FC Dallas star having some good moments, including setting up the goal for Antonee Robinson. But while the effort was there, the crispness was not, as Ferreira squandered a few good chances. Chalk that up to inexperience or out-of-season rust, or both. Gyasi Zardes got the second start as Berhalter leaned on a veteran against Canada, but he did little to impact the game as Canada bunkered in. Despite Zardes' energy and effort, the U.S. needed someone that could unlock Canada and, on that day, it was not him. It may not be quite time to move on from the Columbus Crew forward but, with young forwards scattered all over Europe, it was a missed opportunity for Zardes to prove he belongs. And that brings us to Ricardo Pepi, who finally started the third game of the window. He had his moments against Honduras, but still no goals. He remains the USMNT's leading scorer in this qualifying cycle, but Pepi has not scored since his brace against Jamaica in October. With names like Josh Sargent, Daryl Dike, Jordan Pefok and Matthew Hoppe all still in the mix, there are still more questions than answers up top for the U.S. to figure out. There are certainly plenty of talented wingers in the USMNT pool, but Tim Weah looked like the best of them this window. In Weah, the U.S. has a player that can do so many things. He can take the game vertical with his pace; he can create with his ability to beat players while dribbling; and he can get on the end of chances by either arriving late or driving into the box. Weah did all three against Honduras after impressing against El Salvador as well. He almost certainly would have featured against Canada if not for some vaccination confusion, and he very well could have made the difference due to his ability to widen the field. As things stand, Weah is one of the USMNT's most in-form players, for club and country, and is a key piece of their attacking system. But that may have to change as Gio Reyna returns to health, only further complicating the winger pool. Regardless, the U.S. has a good problem when it comes to the winger group, and Weah continues to make his own case for minutes by proving he can shine in different types of games. Just takes one game to get back on that 🌊 @cpulisic_10 Until the 67th minute of Wednesday's game, Christian Pulisic found himself bound for the ""Losers"" category, but it is ammazing what a much-needed goal can do. Pulisic got that goal after coming on as a substitute against Honduras. It was a well-hit finish on the half-volley following a set-piece scramble. Not the most beautiful goal Pulisic will score, but he will not care. It comes at a time when the American star has struggled, both with Chelsea and the national team. He is played in a variety of different positions at Stamford Bridge, leading to a lack of rhythm that was evident against both El Salvador and Canada. Pulisic cut inside too often, dribbled too much and looked like a player that knew he needed to make something happen so as to change the narrative that currently surrounds him. He eventually got the bounce he needed against Honduras, but now it is time to see what that means. Can he use this as a springboard towards brighter days? He will hope so, and so will the U.S., because they will need Pulisic to be at his best in March.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/pulisic-mckennie-winners-losers-usmnt-world-cup-qualifiers/blt10e722771320533a,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2789,Julio Enciso: Paraguay wonderkid earning transfer interest from Europe,"Meeting your idol is the dream of every football fan, no matter the age. Paraguay wonderkid Julio Enciso, though, has gone one step further. The Libertad striker was just six years old when he watched ex-Benfica ace Oscar Cardozo lead the Paraguay charge during their journey to the 2010 World Cup quarter-finals, where they were narrowly beaten by eventual winners Spain. Now 17, Enciso is not only part of the Libertad attacking line alongside Cardozo, who is 21 years his senior, but the pair also earned call-ups to the national team during September's World Cup qualifiers. “I dreamed it one day, now I am living it thanks to God next to my idol, the great wizard,” Enciso wrote on Twitter, sharing two photos: one next to Cardozo during his first pre-season with Libertad, the second at Paraguay's training camp. Enciso's rise has been dizzying indeed, as just two years separate the images, proof of just how quickly he has risen through the ranks to become the Guarani's great hope for future glory. The forward grew up sharing a single house with his parents and grandparents in the city of Caaguazu, until a successful trial led him to move to the nation's capital, Asuncion, with Libertad. “I remember very well that we saw him on 30 May, 2016. He was only 12 when we signed him,” Libertad scout Nelson Zacarias told Cronica. “He's a showman, he has incredible talent. ""His mother was a house cleaner and his father, a street vendor. Libertad gave his father a job and his mother a wage too so they would come to Asuncion with their son, who is now a champion with the first team and a Paraguay international.” Julio Enciso inauguró el marcador para el Gumarelo.📺 100/710 HD - Tigo Star💻 https://t.co/MWNkQNfaYG¡Disfrutá la #CopaParaguay por Tigo Sports! https://t.co/eZwGHakxyb Enciso made an immediate impact in the club's youth ranks, where his uncanny ability in front of goal led to a positional change. “I used to play in midfield, [the first-team coaches] saw me there and noticed that I liked to pull off tricks and moved me up front,” Enciso recalled to La Nacion. “In the Under-14s I scored 33 goals from midfield!” After just two years at Libertad, the youngster was already turning heads. “It all started when I was playing in the club's [U15s], I remember we played a tournament in Brazil, against Boca Juniors, River Plate, Gremio and other teams,” he explained to Ultima Hora. “I scored in all five games. When the tournament ended I was told that the Boca and River directors were both interested in me.” Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: Libertad coach Leonel Alvarez, part of the great Colombia side of the early 1990s, was also watching carefully. Alvarez called Enciso up to his first-team squad and, while he left soon after, his managerial successor on the bench, Jose Chamot, gave the teenager his debut on 16 March, 2019, against Deportivo Santani, just two months after his 15th birthday. Most kids that age might wilt under the pressure; Enciso waited a mere eight minutes before skinning his marker with a Ronaldinho-esque elastica that almost led to Libertad's fourth goal of the evening. Copa America gets under way later today (live on BBC in the UK 📺).The youngest player at the tournament (by a distance) is Paraguay forward Julio Enciso 🇵🇾 The 17-year-old has scored five goals in 17 games for his club Libertad this season 🔥#NXGN https://t.co/aVyJbpRHp9 From there, Enciso has not looked back. In 2020, he became (at the time) the youngest player to score in the Copa Libertadores this century when he netted against Bolivian outfit Jorge Wilstermann, while in 2021 he earned a call-up to Paraguay's Copa America squad, where he was the youngest player at the tournament and became the nation's fourth-youngest debutant of all time when he replaced Gabriel Avalos during their victory over Bolivia. To cap it all, 2021 also saw Libertad lift the Apertura title - Enciso chipped in with four goals in 13 appearances - and fall just short of Copa Sudamericana glory at the semi-final stage, while on an individual level the prodigy was rewarded with the Paraguayan league's Revelation award. Enciso was also able to fulfil one of his most heartfelt ambitions in December, as he explained to Cronica: “I have many dreams and one was to buy my parents a house, and I have done that, I bought them a house right next to my grandparents in Caaguazu.” Libertad boss Daniel Garnero is just one of Enciso's ever-growing group of admirers. “He has speed, he can dribble,” he told reporters back in May, “Julio is the real deal, he is in a stage of growth and has to take advantage. “He has very healthy team-mates in the squad, who are teaching him constantly, in particular Tacuara Cardozo. He has adopted him totally and Julito feels very comfortable with that... he does not tolerate mistakes, he demands so much of himself.” Once the 2022 season kicks off, Enciso will have the privilege of sharing the field with not one, but two living Paraguay legends, as ex-Manchester City star Roque Santa Cruz, 40, completed a move from Olimpia at the end of 2021. The youngest of the trio, though, may have his days numbered at Libertad. Enciso turns 18 on 23 January, and, with 50 senior games already under his belt and a burgeoning reputation, would be an irresistible transfer prospect for clubs across the world. “There are rumours of my transfer, but I don't think about that,” he signalled to Ultima Hora in December amid reports of interest from Europe and North America. “If it happens, it's welcome, but I am very focused on Libertad and on continuing to work hard and grow.” His agent, Pedro Aldave, added to 1080 AM: ""They are asking a lot about him in England and Italy... in the short or medium term, his destination is Europe."" He may not be the finished article just yet, with work needed both on the physical aspect of his game and his aerial ability, but Enciso has shown already that he has the talent and, perhaps even more importantly, the right attitude to succeed at the very top level.

6903,"Cristiano Ronaldo contract: Man Utd star's wages, expiry date & clauses","When Cristiano Ronaldo made a triumphant return to Manchester United in 2021, he had high hopes of helping to restore the club to its former glory. However, despite his best efforts - 24 goals across 38 appearances in all competitions during the 2021-22 campaign - the Red Devils floundered in the Premier League and exited the Champions League at the last-16 stage. Despite his obvious affection for the Old Trafford outfit, Ronaldo was desperate to leave ahead of the 2022-23 campaign in search of Champions League football. United were initially reluctant to allow the Portugal star to leave, before eventually accepting the iconic attacker's desire to move on. However, no clubs showed a serious interest in signing Ronaldo due to his perceived excessive wage demands. He was thus forced to stay put and things have gone from bad to worse for him over the course of the last month. Ronaldo often had to settle for a spot on the bench and things got out of hand when he refused to come off the substitute bench in the 2-0 win over Tottenham, before leaving the premises altogether before the final whistle. His actions didn't go down well with Erik ten Hag, with the Dutchman dropping Ronaldo for the away match against Chelsea - and a departure in the January window now seems even more inevitable than before. Does his contract allow for an early exit, though?  GOAL takes a look at when his existing deal expires, what kind of money he earns, a potential exist clause and more. Ronaldo's contract at Manchester United is due to expire on June 30, 2023. However, the club have an option to extend the deal by another year, which would take it up to June 30, 2024. The Red Devils signed Ronaldo from Juventus in August 2021 on an initial two-year deal. He will be 38 and four months old by the time his contract with the Premier League club concludes in 2023. Ronaldo earns £385,00 ($466k) a week as part of his contract with Manchester United, according to a report from the Daily Mail. That means Ronaldo's annual salary at Old Trafford is around £20 million ($24m), before performance-related bonuses and associated financial accoutrements are taken into account. It's customary in certain countries to have a minimum fee release clause in contracts, but that's not the case in the UK and Ronaldo does not have an exit clause in his existing deal. That is unlikely to cause any issues, though, as multiple reports have suggested Man Utd would be willing to let go of the attacker on a free transfer to facilitate a move and get his massive wages off the books. As one of the most decorated footballers of all time, Ronaldo would have no shortage of suitors for his signature and some of Europe's biggest clubs were linked during the summer window. German Bundesliga behemoths Bayern Munich were touted as a possible destination, while a stay in the Premier League seemed to be on the cards at Chelsea - though such a move would undoubtedly have upset United fans. A return to Serie A was - and probable still is - also a possibility, with Napoli and Roma - where Jose Mourinho is boss - reported as clubs who would be willing to strike a deal. Meanwhile, rumours of a return to Real Madrid, where Ronaldo won four Champions League titles, also briefly swirled, with the Portugal icon's agent Jorge Mendes said to have been assessing the landscape. The likes of Paris Saint-Germain would be among the few clubs able to afford the attacker, while an emotional return to Sporting, where his football journey began, is the sort of well worn path taken by many professionals.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/when-cristiano-ronaldo-man-utd-contract-expire/bltfc84fc1d01ae57bb,Ryan Kelly,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3993,Tau: Bafana Bafana and Al Ahly star sustains injury after scoring in Caf Champions League,"Bafana Bafana forward Percy Tau grabbed his first goal in the Caf Champions League and later suffered an injury as Al Ahly defeated Al-Merrikh 3-1 in their Group A fixture on Saturday. The 27-year-old scored the opener for the Egyptian giants in the 19th minute and they led 1-0 at the half-time break in the fifth fixture at Al-Salam Stadium in Cairo, Egypt. In the second half, Ramadan Agab pulled a goal back for the Sudanese outfit but Mohamed Sherif restored Al Ahly’s lead in the 72nd minute before Ahmed Abdel Kader scored the third in the 73rd minute. It was Al Ahly who started the game on a high note and they took the lead when Tau’s right-footed effort from outside the box sneaked between the hands of goalkeeper Monged Abuzaid and into the net. Al-Merrikh were forced to wait until the second half to level matters when Agab side-stepped past the Al Ahly defenders before planting the ball past goalkeeper Mohammed El Shenawy. Their celebrations were, however, shortlived as the defending champions doubled their lead through Sherif, who hit it from a rebound, and a minute later, they sealed their third win of the group stage campaign when Kader scored with a clever chip past Abuzaid. Al Ahly, however, suffered a blow as Tau picked up an injury and was replaced by Taher Mohamed. Al Ahly have confirmed the former Brighton & Hove Albion player suffered a bruise in his knee and he will undergo more examinations. “Ahmed Abu Abla, the team’s doctor, provided details on the injuries of Tau and Mohamed Hany that forced them to withdraw from the game against Al Merrikh on Friday,” read part of the statement in the club’s official website. “Abu Abla stated Tau suffered a bruise in his knee and he will undergo more examinations when the team returns to training.  Abu Abla added that Hany felt pain in his adductor muscle and the coaching staff preferred to replace him.” The injury could be a blow for Bafana coach Hugo Broos, who had named the player in his 23-man squad for the friendly against France and Guinea. South Africa will face Guinea in Belgium on March 25 before they come up against world champions France in Lille on March 29.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tau-bafana-bafana-and-al-ahly-star-sustains-injury-after-scoring-/blt24a6dcc9c6e5d400,Dennis Mabuka,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10982,West Ham vs Leeds: Prediction and Preview,"Sunday’s clash between West Ham United and Leeds United is simply a must-not-lose game for the Yorkshire side, who could be relegated should other results go against them on Saturday, and they suffer defeat in east London. Both West Ham and Leeds have found the 2022-23 Premier League campaign a struggle, with the Hammers spending 80 days in the drop zone – their most since 2017-18 (87) – and Leeds currently occupying one of the relegation spots. That said, the night before this game will be just the 34th night Leeds have ended in the bottom three this season, with the Whites hovering just above the drop for most of the season and landing in it at the worst possible time. After an excellent seventh-place finish in the Premier League last season, West Ham have toiled this campaign, losing 19 games, five more than they did last season. They’ve also managed to find the net just 38 times, having scored at least 60 in each of the previous two campaigns (62 in 2020-21, 60 in 2021-22). The Hammers have found goals hard to come by, with Saïd Benrahma their top scorer with six goals and Michail Antonio managing just five, exactly half the totals he posted in each of the previous three seasons (10 in each). Although West Ham have had a poor domestic season, they have excelled in Europe, reaching the Conference League final by defeating AZ in the semi-final, and have won more games (13) in European competitions than in the Premier League (10) in 2022-23. They have won 25 games in all competitions, which is their joint most in a season in the Premier League era, along with the 25 they won last season. Their 14 home wins are their most in a season since winning 15 in 2004-05 at Upton Park, and most as a top-flight side since 1999-00 (15). For Leeds, the season began with seven points from three Premier League games, a position from which only two sides had ever previously been relegated – Wolves in 2011-12 and West Brom in 2017-18. But after beating Chelsea in August, their form has seen them win just five times in 33 games, a record that only already relegated Southampton can match. They conceded 23 Premier League goals in April, a new record in a single month in the competition, breaking their own record of 20 from February 2022. Four different managers have taken charge of a game for the club this season, with relegation firefighter Sam Allardyce recently taking over from Javi Gracia, who lasted just 11 league games in charge after taking over from Jesse Marsch (with Michael Skubala as three-game caretaker in between). Last week, we looked at how effective late-season managerial changes have been historically. Allardyce’s two games in charge have yielded one point so far, although he has faced Manchester City (1st) and Newcastle United (3rd), which were statistically the most difficult opening two games for a manager at a Premier League club (with an average position of second between them) since Joe Jordan’s two games in caretaker charge of Portsmouth in late 2005, facing Chelsea (1st) and Man Utd (2nd) before handing over to the returning Harry Redknapp. Leeds have conceded the most Premier League goals this season (71) and have the second fewest clean sheets (five), tallies they also ranked unfavourably for in the 2021-22 campaign too (second most goals conceded and second fewest clean sheets). Their defensive issues have simply not gone away, despite also changing goalkeepers under Allardyce, with the former England manager favouring the older Joel Robles over the beleaguered Illan Meslier. London proved to be a good place to visit for Leeds on the final day of last season, when they beat Brentford to stay up, but since then they haven’t picked up a single point in the capital, conceding 18 goals across their six defeats. They are the only team in the top flight this season to have visited London as an away side and not managed to pick up a single point. Going into the last meeting between West Ham and Leeds, the Hammers had lost their previous five Premier League matches, their worst losing run since April 2017 and David Moyes’ worst run since October 2005 when he was Everton boss, with the pressure very much on the Scotsman with the Hammers in 17th position. Leeds weren’t faring much better under Jesse Marsch, with two wins from 13 league games going into the clash at Elland Road. The result was a 2-2 draw in which both teams held a lead before surrendering it, halting West Ham’s losing run but extending Leeds’ winless run to four games. Manager Marsch would only last three more (winless) league games in charge before being sacked after a 1-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest. It was the third time Leeds had scored first in a home Premier League game against West Ham since promotion in 2020 and the third time they had failed to win, although at least they took a point in this one – they lost 2-1 in the other two in 2020-21 and 2021-22. It also meant the only time Leeds had beaten the Hammers in the last three seasons was a 3-2 away win in January 2022, the last win of Marcelo Bielsa’s reign at the club, with Jack Harrison netting a hat-trick. The game was symptomatic of Leeds’ lack of control after scoring first – in the 2020-21 campaign, they scored first in 18 Premier League games and only then fell behind in two of them (one was at home to West Ham). In 2021-22, they scored first 16 times and fell behind in five. This season, they have scored first in 14 games and then gone behind seven times, a ratio of 50% – 39% higher than in their first season back in the top-flight in 2020-21 (11%). The game with West Ham in January was the fifth time this season Leeds had scored first and then failed to win, something which has happened four times since. Only Nottingham Forest (10) have scored first in more Premier League games this season and failed to win than Leeds (nine). West Ham capitalised on Leeds’ sloppiness and cancelled out Willy Gnonto’s opening goal via a Lucas Paquetá penalty in first-half stoppage time. They then went ahead in the first minute of the second half with a goal from Gianluca Scamacca. West Ham are one of only four teams to have scored in the 45th and 46th minutes of an away Premier League game and were the first since Chelsea against Aston Villa in April 2016. Rodrigo’s 70th-minute goal for Leeds – his 10th of the season – levelled the game and, despite Leeds having seven of the last 11 shots, 2-2 is how it ended. Leeds enjoyed 63.3% possession in the match, well above their Premier League average under former manager Marsch (49.9%) and a figure they have only bettered in a league game once since (70% vs. Nottingham Forest in February). The Whites also had six shots on target, only having more in one game under the American, his third game in charge last March vs Norwich (seven). They’ve only managed more shots on target in one Premier League game since then, having seven – all in the first half – against Crystal Palace in April, a game they lost 5-1. West Ham come into Sunday’s game on a run of four defeats in their last five Premier League matches, conceding at least twice in every defeat. Across their last 10 games, they have either kept a clean sheet (four games) or conceded at least two goals (six games), with the 18 goals they have conceded in that time the joint fifth of any club, with Leeds topping the list with 27 conceded in that timeframe. The Hammers haven’t won any of their last 20 Premier League games in which they’ve conceded (D6 L14) since a 3-1 win over Fulham in October, with nine of their 10 wins this season coming to nil. One of those wins was in their last home game, beating Manchester United 1-0, and their last four home games have been against teams starting the day third, first, seventh and fourth, marking a very difficult run of games at London Stadium. They haven’t lost a home game against a team starting in the relegation zone since December 2017 against Newcastle and are unbeaten in 12 since (W10 D2). Clean sheets have been a big issue for Leeds, with none in their last 12 Premier League games, a run that only Nottingham Forest can top (15 games without one – their last was a 1-0 win over Leeds). The Whites have, however, also scored in each of their last 11 games since a 1-0 defeat to Chelsea. That run of 11 consecutive games with both teams scoring is the longest by a Premier League side since Everton did so in 16 games in a row between September 2012 and January 2013. Leeds have conceded a whopping 150 league goals since the start of last season (79 in 2021-22 and 71 so far this season), more than any other side in Europe’s top five leagues in that time. Sam Allardyce has been brought in to rectify those defensive issues, with ‘clean sheets’ the top of his Allardyce Survival Blueprint that was unveiled on a Monday Night Football appearance on Sky in September 2017. Since then, he has managed 51 Premier League matches across spells with Everton, West Brom and Leeds and kept as many clean sheets as he has seen his teams concede three or more goals (12), which suggests he has his work cut out in the short timeframe he has to improve the Whites defensively. It’s unlikely to be stylish football under Allardyce for the Whites, who have posted their fewest successful passes since returning to the Premier League in 2020 in both games under him (120 vs. Man City, 163 vs. Newcastle), while their two highest long pass percentages have also been in his opening two games (25.4% vs. Man City, 25.7% vs. Newcastle). However, style, at this late stage, will be as unimportant to Allardyce as it will be to the Leeds fans if he can guide them to safety. It is looking highly likely that Declan Rice will, finally, depart West Ham in the summer with manager David Moyes saying there is a “good chance” he will leave the club. It’s not difficult to see why Rice is so highly regarded by a host of other top clubs. Rice has won possession more times (322) and made more interceptions (62) than any Premier League player this season, while only Rodri (7,184m) has carried the ball a further distance than Rice (6,439m) among central midfielders. Rice has also covered the second most distance in the division (391km) and recently started his 188th Premier League game for West Ham – at the age of 24, only Mark Noble and Aaron Cresswell had started more games for the Hammers in the competition. That durability is also borne out in the number of games he’s played across the league – in the last five seasons, the only outfield player with more Premier League starts than Rice (173) is central defender James Tarkowski (180), with the Everton defender also the only outfielder with more minutes than Rice (15,573). Rodrigo has been Leeds United’s best source of goals this season, scoring 14 in all competitions and 12 in the Premier League (outscoring his xG by 4.15 in the process), both seasonal bests for the Spaniard at the Whites. Going into the World Cup, only three players – Haaland (18), Kane (12) and Toney (10) – had more Premier League goals than Rodrigo (nine), who made an excellent start to the season, netting in Leeds’ last four games prior to the World Cup break. Goals have been harder to come by in more recent times – three in 16 league games since then – but injuries and the changes in managers haven’t helped, as evidenced by the fact that his last three goals have come under different managers – Jesse Marsch (vs. West Ham in January), Javi Gracia (vs. Wolves in March) and Sam Allardyce (vs. Man City in May). One other thing in Rodrigo’s favour going into this game is his record against teams beginning with W. He has netted in his last five Premier League games against those teams, scoring three times vs. Wolves and once against both Watford and West Ham. It’s unsurprising that in his first Premier League spell in 2010-11 in Bolton, his only goal came against Wigan. West Ham are the favourites for this game with the Opta supercomputer, given a 41.2% chance of victory, compared to just 29.7% for Leeds. Despite losing four of their last five Premier League matches, West Ham won their last home game against Manchester United and have won their last two games against sides in the relegation zone, beating Everton in January and Southampton in April. Leeds’ horrendous record in London – 14 defeats in 18 Premier League games in the capital since promotion in 2020 – stands against them, with the Whites keeping just one clean sheet across those 18 games, a 0-0 draw with Crystal Palace last April. One of their three wins, however, came against West Ham last January, while another was in their must-win game against Brentford on the final day of last season. Going into the weekend, the Opta supercomputer has Leeds at a 65.7% chance of relegation back to the Championship, not helped by their recent record, a run of just two points in seven Premier League matches, and just three wins in their last 23 in the competition. They will need to upset the odds to avoid their first Premier League relegation since 2004 – and it took them 16 years to return to the top flight last time. West Ham’s most fancied final position is 15th (43% according to the supercomputer), happily clear of the drop. It would however be their second-lowest position since returning to the Premier League in 2012-13, finishing 16th in 2019-20, and a drop of eight places compared to last season’s seventh-place finish.

1297,Sudakov could play for Barcelona or Man City but instead he's in a bunker for a senseless war – Shakhtar Donetsk reserve coach Valente,"Giorgi Sudakov has the potential to play for Barcelona or Manchester City, says Shakhtar Donetsk youth coach Fernando Valente, as the latter revealed the former is sheltering in a bunker amid the ongoing Ukraine-Russia crisis. Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of their neighbouring Eastern European country last month, sparking the largest theatre of conflict in Europe since WWII, necessitating the suspension of all professional leagues within Ukraine. Taking to social media, Valente paid tribute to teenager Sudakov, who made his senior breakthrough last term and is a thrice-capped Ukraine international, with the coach stating that his ""heart is broken"" that he and the rest of the country is caught up in a ""senseless war"". ""Sudakov was the most talented player I ever coached,” Valente wrote. “A Ukrainian international, who recently renewed his contract with Shakhtar until 2026; a wonderful human being with a little girl on the way with his wife Lisa… ""They had dreams to fulfill, dreams that have been snatched away by a bunker for a senseless war. I pray for this couple and the for all the young players and friends that I made in Ukraine and who made me happy for the two years I was there. My heart is broken.” Valente further hailed his player to Portuguese agency Agnecia Lusa, adding: “Sudakov is a lad with enormous potential, he could even play for Barcelona or Manchester City. He was the best player I coached and we have a strong relationship."" Sudakov remains one of many Ukraine stars who remain in their home country, either trapped or fighting the Russian invasion. Several others have continued to play abroad with their clubs, such as West Ham star Andriy Yarmolenko, who broke down in tears after scoring against Aston Villa at the weekend. Russia, meanwhile, remain banned from club and international competition within Europe as part of a sweeping set of sporting sanctions issued against the nation.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/sudakov-barcelona-man-city-instead-bunker-senseless-war-shakhtar-/blt165cbd46d79954a1,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4325,Kuffour responds to Gyan over Ashimeru snub for Ghana duel with Nigeria in World Cup qualifiers,"Former Bayern Munich defender Samuel Osei Kuffour believes legendary Ghana striker Asamoah Gyan acted inappropriately by his public outburst over the squad announced for the nation’s 2022 World Cup qualifying double-header against Nigeria.  Upon release of the 27-man roster for the upcoming games on Tuesday, Gyan took to social media to call out team officials over the snub of in-form Anderlecht midfielder Majeed Ashimeru.  He later deleted the post, despite maintaining his stance, but apologised for his choice of words in describing the player’s absence as “nonsense”.  “He [Gyan] has his personal view on certain players as a human being but put that aside and go to the coaches, they have monitored every player,” Kuffour, currently a management committee member of the Black Stars, told Kessben FM.  “How many matches has Ashimeru played and not been invited?  “Asamoah Gyan is part of Ghana, he has captained this team so my little advice is that when things like this happen, you can call one or two people. But when you put it on your page and using the word ‘nonsense’ I don’t think it’s fair. “You can go on and say what you want to say but certain words are not appropriate to use.” After a slow start to the season, Ashimeru has seemingly hit a purple patch of form, having started in each of Anderlecht’s last seven games.  Overall this season, he has made 32 league outings for the Belgian giants, scoring three goals and providing three assists. “This guy Majeed Ashimeru is the best midfielder in Ghana, after Thomas Partey, PERIOD. I have kept quiet on this but this nonsense must stop. Smh,” Gyan wrote in a tweet, which he later deleted and followed up with a new post, saying: “I still insist that Ashimeru deserves to be in this current Black Stars BUT am sorry for using the word ‘Nonsense’ in my statement, so I unreservedly withdraw that word, I was carried by my emotions. Go Ghana!” Gyan is not only Ghana’s all-time top scorer and most capped player, but also Africa’s all-time top scorer at the World Cup. Ghana host Nigeria in Kumasi on Friday and travel away for the reverse fixture in Abuja four days later.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/kuffour-responds-to-gyan-over-ashimeru-snub-for-ghana-duel/blt317d92410b2fbb51,Prince  Narkortu Teye,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1488,Fabio Chiarodia: The teenage Italian defender breaking records in Germany,"In Bundesliga history, only two clubs have ever won more points than Werder Bremen: Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. They also share the record for the most seasons played in the German top flight alongside Bayern and yet, in 2021-22, they find themselves playing in the second tier following their relegation last season. As such, there is a rebuild taking place at Weserstadion, with the club's academy getting particular attention in the hope of creating a new generation of homegrown stars. That was very much in evidence in December, when the club set a new record for its youngest ever player as they aimed to hold on for a 3-2 win over Jahn Regensburg. Deep into stoppage time, centre-back Fabio Chiarodia was introduced off the bench for his debut, trusted by his manager Ole Werner despite being just 16 years and 188 days old at the time. Though he only managed a couple of touches of the ball in the Bavarian snow before the final whistle blew, Chiarodia's appearance was the latest step on a journey that has long seen him marked out as a talent of some repute. Nicknamed 'Das Kuken (The Chick)' by his team-mates, he has trained with the Werder first-team squad since pre-season, while elite European clubs are reported to be tracking his progress, including Juventus and Chelsea. ℝ𝕖𝕞𝕖𝕞𝕓𝕖𝕣 𝕥𝕙𝕖 𝕟𝕒𝕞𝕖1️⃣6️⃣ years6️⃣ months5️⃣ daysCongratulations on becoming the youngest-ever player to make their #Werder debut, Fabio #Chiarodia! 💚 pic.twitter.com/kzwoyB7i0T It is all a dream come true for Chiarodia, who was born just 50 kilometres west of Bremen in Oldenburg – 12 years after his parents took the decision to move from the Italian town of Cinto Caomaggiore, near Venice, to Lower Saxony. Chiarodia's father, Ivano, now works in a town-centre ice cream shop with his brother-in-law, Roberto, but his youngest son has always been destined to play football for a living, after being plucked from the Oldenburg youth teams by Werder at the age of nine. ""My uncle has always been a big Werder fan, as have I,"" Chiarodia told Werder's official website. ""I often went to the Weserstadion when I was little. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: ""When I joined the academy, I cried tears of joy."" Straight away, he was marked out for his maturity, and the teenager has captained Werder's various age-group sides throughout his ascension to the senior ranks. Though naturally left-footed, he is comfortable with either foot, showing a calmness in possession that more and more modern-day coaches are keen to see from defenders. Comfortable when facing one-on-one situations, he has also developed physically to stand at 6'1'' (186cm), meaning he does not look out of place around those much older than him. He signed his first professional contract in October 2021 and the first team have worked hard to integrate him into the senior squad. ""When I entered the locker room for the first time and introduced myself, someone asked me where I came from,"" Chiarodia explained.  ""I answered 'Italy', and someone started singing Italian songs, since we had just won the European Championship!"" Former Borussia Dortmund defender Omer Toprak has played a key role in helping Chiarodia, with the youngster adding: ""In the first weeks with the first team, I was always silent, I didn't speak to anyone. If someone asked me questions, I went cold. ""I was very nervous, and it was he [Toprak] who let me ease into it. He helped me a lot ."" Though Chiarodia has played a number of friendlies for the senior side, his debut remains his only competitive outing to date, with the club keen to build up his minutes with the Under-19s while allowing him to train with the first team. Their plan is likely to involve him being promoted to the senior ranks on a full-time basis for the 2022-23 campaign. Doing so would certainly help when it comes to tying him down to a new contract, with his current deal having entered its final 18 months. ""Fabio is one of the most talented players in Europe, who is already in the notebooks of top international clubs,"" Werder sporting director, Frank Baumann, told Kicker. Juve would certainly love to have a potential future star of the Italy national team in their ranks, with Chiarodia having opted to represent the Azzurri, despite having been called-up to the Germany U15s squad in the past. The feeling in Italy, as well as in Bremen, is that 'The Chick' will soon be a name on everyone's lips.  Werder just hope he can help re-establish them among Bundesliga's best first.

1460,Tuchel unhappy with Lukaku performance against Man City as Chelsea boss says he lost possession too much,"Thomas Tuchel has admitted that he was left frustrated by Romelu Lukaku's performance for Chelsea against Manchester City, in Saturday's Premier League defeat at the Etihad Stadium. Kevin De Bruyne's second-half strike was enough to seal a 1-0 victory for Pep Guardiola's hosts, who finished the match with a 13-point lead over the Blues - their nearest rivals - at the summit. Unlike his countryman, Lukaku was frequently unable to effect as much control in a frequently muted showing from the visitors - and speaking after the final whistle, Tuchel acknowledged that he had been left unhappy with his efforts. ""We had eight or nine offensive transitions, but had zero touches in the box,"" the German stated in his post-match comments. ""That was a big problem today, the performance of our front players. A lack of position, timing and composure. We lost too many balls too easily. ""Romelu Lukaku sometimes needs to [deliver] the service. He is included in this, he had many ball losses in very promising circumstances. He had a huge chance. ""Of course we want to serve him, but he is part of the team, and the performance up front, we can do much better. "" The German expounded upon his side's overall performance - where they failed to land a shot on target in the first half - and noted that he felt like they deserved a point at least, while adding that he acknowledges City may now be too far to catch. ""I thought we deserved a draw, we defended very well,"" he added. ""We did not allow big chances. We were not under so much pressure. A draw would be a fair result but we don’t have it."" ""We will never give up, but if City keep winning every game, nobody can catch them."" With the gap now more than a dozen points, Chelsea's hopes of dethroning City looks to be at an end, with Guardiola claiming revenge for last year's Champions League final loss. The Blues however remain in contention to defend their European crown, and could indeed secure a double still, having made it to the Carabao Cup final earlier this month against Tottenham. City meanwhile will hope to go one step further in Europe this year, having delivered another convincing run through the group stages against tough opposition.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tuchel-unhappy-with-lukaku-performance-against-man-city-as/blt6e35c72b8aaccd07,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Arsenal suffered a shock loss away at Premier League new boys Brentford back in August, with goals from Sergi Canos and Christian Norgaard sealing a 2-0 win for Thomas Frank's side. Toney took to social media to rub salt in the wounds after the game, and Lacazette couldn't resist his own dig at the Bees striker after Arsenal picked up a 2-1 victory in the reverse fixture at Emirates Stadium on Saturday. Toney's post-match tweet following Brentford's early-season win read: ""Nice kick about with the boys.""

Bukayo Saka doubled the hosts' advantage in the 79th minute, latching onto a Thomas Partey pass on the left before firing an unstoppable left-foot shot into the far corner of the net with the aid of the post. Christian Norgaard pulled a goal back for Brentford in stoppage time but Arsenal held on for a vital three points that served as a major boost to their bid for Champions League qualification.

7864,Aguero says he didn't want to leave City & was shocked when Messi exited Barca,"Sergio Aguero has reflected on his short stay at Barcelona and having to retire from the game due to a heart problem.  Aguero was a hugely prolific striker during his heyday and is best-known for a decorated 10-year spell with Man City. The Argentine - who scored 41 times in 101 caps for his country - remains City's all-time leading goalscorer with 260 goals. But after slipping down the pecking order under Pep Guardiola, the club revealed in March 2021 that he would leave that summer upon the expiry of his contract. And Aguero revealed he was keen to stay at the club he had grown to love, but soon saw his head-turned by the opportunity of joining Barcelona.   'In January 2021 City told me that they were not going to renew my contract,' he told Juan Pablo Varsky on Clank. 'In February they confirmed it to me. 'I wanted one more year, I was willing to be on the bench. I had been playing little with Pep, but I wanted to help. 'I felt that being a year it was going to serve me physically to play in the World Cup. '(But then) a call came from Barca, but they couldn't pay me what City were. I didn't care, I told my manager to put the numbers in and it was fixed in two days. 'When I had it closed I spoke to Leo (Messi), I imagined playing with him and what happened happened....' However, a reunion with his fellow countryman never took place, with Barcelona unable to afford a new deal for Messi, who eventually joined PSG, due to financial restrictions. And Aguero admitted that was tough to take and he couldn't quite believe Messi would depart the club where he became an icon. He added: 'Leo assured me that it was going to be fixed (his renewal with Barca), that he was going to start training. 'I saw the news and I thought it was a fake. I wrote to him and he said ""yes"". I didn't even know what answer him, I didn't answer him anymore. I saw him the next day and he was pretty bad. 'As soon as Leo left, the club offered me the number 10, I told them no. No. because I didn't want to use it, I had been the 10 in all my clubs... but I believed that Messi was going to return. 'I told them that someone else should use it. ""You are the only one who can use it, you or Ansu"", they told me. I told them to give it to Ansu Fati, for me the 10 is Leo's, if he's not there, don't use it.' After a slow bedding in period at the Nou Camp, Aguero made his debut in October 2021 against Valencia. However, in just his fifth appearance, he was taken to hospital with chest discomfort during a 1-1 draw with Alaves. Initially, it was reported that Aguero would miss three months of action, but after being diagnosed as cardiac arrhythmia - which is a condition of irregularities in the heartbeat - Aguero retired in December 2021 on the advice of doctors. And the 35-year-old opened up on being forced to stop playing the game he loved and that fateful day against Alaves.   'As we reach the end of a play I jump to head and start looking at my goal,' he said. 'I'm starting to get dizzy, I wanted to say something and the words weren't coming out. 'The Alaves defender was there and grabbed my hand. He started shouting until the referee saw me and stopped the collision. 'When I got down on the grass is when that pressure went down. And my heart started beating faster. I got the arrhythmia. I had already had smaller episodes. 'And a week before it had happened to me in training. The doctor told me to calm down that it was going to stop, but it didn't stop. 'Two minutes were like 20. I took it as if it was going to cure, and I was hospitalised for four days and then the diagnosis came.'",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Aguero-says-he-didnt-want-to-leave-City--was-shocked-when-Messi-exited-Barca/3301273,,13-Feb,all-football-app
10194,Will Kevin De Bruyne’s Return Decide the Premier League Title Race?,"Manchester City have been without Kevin De Bruyne since the first game of the Premier League season. Now that he’s back, how much of a difference can the Belgium international make? You’ve all played those computer games where you’re up against the final boss, who looks vulnerable and on the cusp of being vanquished, before they find another weapon from somewhere and knock you back down again. That must be how Manchester City’s rivals feel having worked so hard to edge ahead of the defending Premier League champions, only to see the ominous figure (and fantastic hair) of Kevin De Bruyne return from injury. Pep Guardiola’s all-conquering side have wobbled in recent times, allowing for Liverpool, Arsenal and even Aston Villa to threaten the status quo, which for five of the last six seasons has been City at the top of the tree. When De Bruyne came off with a hamstring injury against Burnley in the opening game of the Premier League season, it provided an intriguing possibility. How would Man City manage without their creator-in-chief for half the season? Initially, they were fine, winning their first six Premier League games as well as the UEFA Super Cup. Defeat at Newcastle United in the EFL Cup was followed by back-to-back Premier League losses at Wolves and Arsenal, though, before an even longer run of dropped points in November and December. City won just one out of six league games prior to the FIFA Club World Cup (D4 L1), seeing them lose their grip on the top spot. Victories against Everton and Sheffield United post-Christmas have taken them back up into third place in the Premier League, though, ahead of Arsenal on goal difference and five points behind leaders Liverpool with a game in hand. Now, following De Bruyne’s return from the bench in the FA Cup third round thrashing of Huddersfield Town – including an obligatory assist – City look ready to do as they so often do and put their foot down in the second half of the season; starting with a repeat of the first fixture they failed to win following De Bruyne’s injury. Return of the 👑It's good to have you back on the pitch, @KevinDeBruyne 🩵 pic.twitter.com/kAc4N01h3p A trip to Newcastle on Saturday could be a tricky prospect for the defending champions, having lost 1-0 there in the EFL Cup earlier this season, and with Eddie Howe’s side boasting the third-best home record in the division in 2023-24. But with their brilliant Belgian available again it could be a different story this time for Manchester City. So, how much have they missed De Bruyne? It’s no secret that he’s a creative fellow. On Man City’s way to the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League treble last season, De Bruyne played 49 games, created 137 chances, 99 from open play, and created 44 big chances (a chance from which the attacking team would usually be expected to score). His 28 assists was eight more than the player with the next most from Europe’s top five leagues (Lionel Messi – 20), 12 more than any other Premier League player (Mohamed Salah – 16) and 15 more than any other City player, which was Riyad Mahrez (13) who left for the Saudi Pro League at the end of last season. Of the remaining City players, Jack Grealish recorded the next most assists in all competitions last season (11) but the most significant discrepancy was in big chances created. As mentioned, De Bruyne was directly responsible for 44 in all competitions in 2022-23, almost three times more than the next most for City, which was Grealish (16). That shows how much creativity was being lost when De Bruyne trudged off injured at Turf Moor. But did it really impact City’s ability to make chances and score goals, or did others step up in his absence? On average last season, De Bruyne created 3.4 chances per 90 minutes, with 2.4 from open play, 1.1 big chances and 0.7 assists. City have spread the wealth more this season, though, with their top performer for chances created per 90 (not including De Bruyne’s three appearances) being Julián Álvarez (2.8), while Grealish leads for chances created from open play per 90 (2.4 – matching De Bruyne from last season) and Jérémy Doku is top for assists per 90 (0.6). Nevertheless, City eased through their Champions League group and were untroubled on their way to winning the FIFA Club World Cup last month, so let’s look specifically at the Premier League. At the halfway point of this season, Man City have scored 45 goals (2.4 per game), had 311 shots (16.4 per game) and created 49 big chances (2.6 per game). Compare that to last season, when they scored 94 goals (2.5 per game), had 600 shots (15.8 per game) and created 103 big chances (2.7 per game). So, City are more or less scoring as many and have actually had slightly more chances per game, although it should be noted that De Bruyne did also miss six of their 38 league games last season. (The graphics below exclude own goals) Their ability at working shots inside the box is also pretty much identical, suggesting they aren’t having many problems working their way through low blocks. City had 410 shots in the penalty area last season in the Premier League (10.8 per game) and have had 202 so far this term (10.6 per game), but their expected goals (xG) have gone down slightly from 2.12 per game in 2022-23 to 1.97 in 2023-24, perhaps indicating the quality of chances being created hasn’t been quite as good on average. There is little question that Man City are a better team with De Bruyne in the team, but his return should not necessarily be seen as a significant needle mover. Since the start of last season, City have played 33 league games with De Bruyne and 24 without. On average, they have scored 2.5 goals with him and 2.4 without, conceded 0.8 goals with and 1.1 without, and have won 2.3 points per game with and 2.2 without. One person who should be very pleased to see De Bruyne back is Erling Haaland. Last season saw eight of Haaland’s Premier League goals assisted by De Bruyne – only three players have created more goals for a single teammate within a Premier League season. The Norwegian has still fired in the goals this season but is averaging 0.92 goals per game in all competitions, down from 1.13 last season. Having said that, even without the Belgian’s presence, Haaland has been averaging more shots per 90 this season (4.2, up from 3.9) has had slightly more big chances per 90 (2.0, up from 1.9) and has a marginally higher xG per 90 (0.98, up from 0.94). It may not be a shock to learn that De Bruyne led the way for City in terms of attacking sequence involvements per 90 in the Premier League last season (7.2), ahead of second-place Rodri (6.5) (minimum 360 minutes). Of those to have played at least 180 minutes this season, Rodri is out in front with an impressive 8.2 per 90, while Grealish is just behind with 8.0. Doku has almost matched De Bruyne’s total from last year at 7.1 per 90, while Phil Foden, Bernardo Silva and Álvarez are each on 6.7, all more than they managed last season. This shows how much several of City’s players have stepped up while De Bruyne has been out. The former Chelsea and Wolfsburg man could potentially make his most significant contribution in the second half of the season in the big games, though. Among City’s slips in the first half of the campaign were 1-0 defeats away to Arsenal and Aston Villa and a 1-1 home draw with Liverpool. In the corresponding fixtures last season, De Bruyne recorded a goal and an assist in both comfortable wins against Arsenal (3-1) and Liverpool (4-1), while he assisted Haaland in a 1-1 draw at Villa. His numbers speak for themselves, and who knows? Perhaps City having to manage without him means others will continue to step up even when De Bruyne is regularly back in the team, taking some of the burden off his shoulders and even allowing him to be eased back in rather than rushed. There is no question Guardiola would rather have De Bruyne available to him than not, and he could well be the catalyst for a charge to another title (and perhaps even another treble) over the next few months. The City boss said after the win over Huddersfield: “Kevin needs to accumulate training sessions, training sessions and more training sessions – even more than games… Now with Newcastle [next weekend] we have another chance, then we have two weeks to have good training sessions here and in Abu Dhabi [during the winter break], so we are ready for the second part of the season. “But I am incredibly happy to have him back because Kevin helps you to win games.” The question is, can he help Man City win enough games from here to make it six Premier League titles in seven seasons?

4350,Man Utd loanee Williams 'taunted and abused' as Norwich fans follow full-back after 4-0 West Ham defeat,"Brandon Williams, on loan at Norwich City from Manchester United, says he was ""taunted and abused"" by Canaries fans after a 4-0 defeat to West Ham on Sunday. The full-back claimed in a social media post that a group of supporters followed him while he was in his car outside Carrow Road. Norwich's impending relegation from the Premier League has prompted fans to protest the club, though Williams alleges some people have acted inappropriately in showing their displeasure. ""Yesterday after leaving the stadium I was taunted and abused by fans surrounding the stadium whilst I was in my car,"" he wrote in a statement posted to Twitter. ""After the abuse I was followed by individuals who only stopped following me once they became aware I had noticed them. ""However passionate fans are, it is not right that a small minority abuse players or, in this case, follow them. ""Since arriving at Norwich I have played for the club as if I were a permanent member of the team. It is unfortunate that a small number of fans behave like this. ""There is no club investigation into my conduct as incorrectly reported in the media. ""I would like to thank those fans who have sent me messages of support at this unsettling time."" Despite being just 21 years old, Williams has been asked to be a regular figure in Norwich's defence this year, which has given him valuable Premier League experience he likely wouldn't have gotten if he had stayed at Old Trafford. He has played in 26 Premier League matches this season after appearing in 21 across the previous two campaigns combined. However, it's been a difficult term at Carrow Road, with the Canaries last in the table through 35 games.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-loanee-williams-taunted-and-abused-as-norwich-fans/blt29b67a7a514c98cb,Dan Bernstein,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6618,Conte's blueprint for beating Man City might give Liverpool the edge in title race,"When Manchester City beat Chelsea 1-0 just six weeks ago, the title race was over.  Thomas Tuchel’s side fell 13 points behind the league leaders while Liverpool, in third, were 14 points off the pace with two games in hand.  Only the most blindly optimistic of Liverpool supporters would have thought it possible to catch Pep Guardiola. But Tottenham Hotspur’s 3-2 victory at the Etihad has put Liverpool in control of their own destiny. Win every game up to and including their crunch match at Man City in mid-April and Jurgen Klopp’s side will be top of the table. That might be a big ask, but it is a crucial psychological shift all the same: Liverpool no longer have to rely on Man City slipping up. For getting a title race back, we have to thank Southampton and Tottenham, responsible for 10 of the 15 points Man City have dropped this season between them.  And while Ralph Hasenuhuttl has previously given us a tactical template to follow – surround Rodri to prevent Man City from building into the final third – Antonio Conte used a wholly different approach. It is one that others could learn from and, with some tricky games up ahead for Man City, it is a tactical strategy that may just give Liverpool an edge in the title race… The basic idea when Spurs were off the ball was disarmingly simple.  In a flat 5-4-1 formation, Conte had no inferiority complex here and was happy to hold a mere 28 per cent possession as his team sat very deep and very narrow to frustrate the hosts.  Banking on being able to slow Man City right down, reducing them to tame possession far from the penalty area or to crosses Spurs could clear away, they diligently stood in a compact blockade – shuffling across as a unit and rarely leaving the width of the penalty box. That narrowness was just as important as the depth, because it meant the half-spaces – the area between centre-back and full-back, in which Guardiola chiefly coaches his players to create – were permanently crowded with bodies.  Either a wing-back or outside centre-back could step up to join the central midfielder or winger, suffocating Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva. There were moments, particularly in the first half, when City were dangerous down their left side, largely because Rodrigo Bentancur was a lone wolf pressing – and therefore leaving base camp – and because Dejan Kulusevski and Emerson Royal are Tottenham’s weakest defenders. However, by and large, Spurs could get bodies around the ball, happily conceding ground and never pressurising a City player until they entered the final third.  From a City perspective, the problem was the same as against Southampton: without a centre forward making clever runs in the penalty area, there was simply nobody to hit. Kevin de Bruyne got lost, hovering out to the right and surrounded by Spurs defenders (per Fbref, he recorded 0.0 xG and 0.0 xGA for only the third time this season), while Phil Foden could not get into the game and caused little damage dropping off the front.  Everybody knows the best way to hurt Manchester City is to launch direct counterattacks that try to get behind their high back-line. However, almost nobody achieves these, largely because City’s press after they lose possession rushes the other team into scrambling the ball clear – and thus the chance of breaking quickly disappears. Spurs, however, were a constant threat thanks to the precision of their three-point moves, which – as Harry Kane said in his post-game interview – had been devised and practised in training throughout the week until the players did not have to think or look before acting. Consequently, they got the passes away before City had a chance to press, and the opening goal was the best example of a trick repeated over and over. Recognising Rodri is left alone at the base of midfield as the two eights roam forward (a weak point throughout the season for City), Conte instructed Kane to drop into the gaps around the Spanish midfielder. Kane’s team-mates would then look to feed him the ball at every opportunity, which itself was a trigger for Kulusevski and Heung-Min Son to start their runs in behind.  This forced City to scramble backwards, destabilising their shape and providing Spurs with multiple opportunities – starting with that opening goal in the fourth minute. Conte’s side repeated the same move throughout the game and City had no answer. Guardiola was unwilling to sit Gundogan deeper alongside Rodri to assist with Kane – a mistake for which he paid dearly. Upcoming opponents who can repeat the model Although simple in theory, not many teams have the defensive coaching of a Conte or a nine/ten like Kane. Next opponents Everton are unlikely to accept such a low block under Frank Lampard and look worryingly open at the back, too, making that game almost certain to be an easy win for Man City. In fact, most of City’s games before Liverpool visit should be easy victories. But the home match against Manchester United could follow a similar pattern to last Saturday’s defeat.  With Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford making the quick runs in behind, and Cristiano Ronaldo coming short to overwhelm Rodri, it is possible Ralf Rangnick can copy this part of the Conte approach. Further down the line, Wolves’ excellent defensive resilience and willingness to sit deep in ‘Big Six’ matches, coupled with the relationship between the creative Raul Jimenez and the pacey Daniel Podence, offers Bruno Lage’s team a glimmer of hope in City’s first game after the six-pointer against Liverpool. West Ham, in the penultimate game of the season, also have the hunched defensive shape and the forward players – Michail Antonio and Jarrod Bowen – to cause problems, with Pablo Fornals able to play the Kane role by dropping into the ten position. That’s at least three games, excluding a potential title-decider against Liverpool, in which Conte’s strategy for defeating Man City can be emulated, meaning Klopp’s team now have a genuine shot at the title.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/conte-blueprint-beating-man-city-liverpool-edge-title-race/bltee2659114335f87c,Alex Keble,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7096,Osimhen and Bassey to Premier League? Akpoborie advises Nigeria duo,"Former Nigeria attacker Jonathan Akpoborie believes striker Victor Osimhen and defender Calvin Bassey are ready for the Premier League. Osimhen has been a hit at Napoli this season and despite some injury setbacks, he featured for them in 27 Serie A matches, scoring 14 goals and providing two assists.   Bassey has also been a key player for Rangers and managed to play for them in 29 Scottish top-tier matches in which he provided three assists. He also played in 15 Europa League matches, where the Gers went all the way to the final and lost to Bundesliga outfit Eintracht Frankfurt in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw in both the regulation and extra time. The duo has been linked with moves to the Premier League and the 53-year-old Akpoborie has shared his view on the possibility. ""Playing in the Premier League is no doubt the dream of many players in the world. And if Osimhen and Bassey decide to choose that path then it’s a good move that should be encouraged,"" the former VfL Wolfsburg striker told Complete Sports."" Akpoborie, who featured for the Super Eagles 13 times and scored four goals, went on to explain what he liked about the two players. ""I have watched Osimhen closely and I appreciate his energy, hunger for goals and determination when on the field of play,"" he added. ""His performance at Napoli is also an indication that he has given a good account of himself. So I am not surprised that teams in the Premier League are battling for his signature. ""Likewise Bassey, who has really surprised many of us, most especially after his debut performance against the Black Stars of Ghana in the 2022 World Cup qualifying playoffs. He’s confident, pacy, and energetic.

3742,Man City turn transfer attentions to Anderlecht's Gomez as left-back search continues,"Manchester City are in talks to sign 21-year-old Anderlecht left-back Sergio Gomez. However, any transfer for the former Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund defender is expected to be in addition to any move for a first-team full-back.  Pep Guardiola would still want a replacement for Oleksandr Zinchenko, who joined Arsenal in earlier in the transfer window, but City have shelved any moves for Brighton's Marc Cucurella as he edges closer to a move to Chelsea.  The Spain under-21 international has been a regular for Belgian side Anderlecht since he switched to them from Dortmund in June 2021.  Gomez was voted the club's Player of the Year last season after making 49 appearances under former boss and ex-City captain Vincent Kompany.  The 21-year-old started as an attacking player during his time at Barcelona's La Masia Academy and was once dubbed the 'new Iniesta'.  Named in GOAL's NXGN top 50 teenagers on the planet in 2019, Dortmund had paid €3m to take him to the Bundesliga but he played just 10 minutes over three first-team appearances before moving to Belgium.  Fellow Spaniard Cucurella was City's top target but they have refused to meet Brighton's £50m ($61m) valuation of another former Barca defender.  City continue to be linked with a number of players but Guardiola currently has right-back Joao Cancelo, academy product Josh Wilson-Esbrand and centre-back Nathan Ake as his options.  ""If it's possible [to strengthen we will] but if not, we stay with the players we have,"" he said ahead of the Community Shield clash with Liverpool.  ""Joao can play there, Josh can play there, Nathan can play there. I never complain about the squad I have since the first season. It is always for the benefit of the club, not for me, and I support the club.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-city-turn-transfer-attentions-to-anderlecht-gomez-left/blt8219ee35bd5c08e8,Jonathan Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
237,Chelsea's Emerson unsure on future but happy to return to Stamford Bridge,"Emerson Palmieri will be happy if Thomas Tuchel says that his future lies with Chelsea ahead of pre-season talks that will decide his future. The full-back had a successful season on loan at Lyon but could have seen his deal in France cut short as his parent club attempted to recall him after a serious injury to Ben Chilwell. The Ligue 1 giants rejected the west Londoners' repeated attempts to bring back Emerson, but - in perfect English, which he carried on learning while in France - he explained his current situation. “I didn’t speak with [head coach Thomas Tuchel] just yet,” Emerson said, speaking after Italy’s 3-0 defeat to Argentina on Wednesday. “I have a contract with Chelsea. I played there for three seasons and I have a lot of friends there. If I come back, I'll be happy. It's a good place and club for me. I don’t know [whether I will return], let’s see what can happen.” Adding on his newly-found confidence in English: “Yes, I improved it a bit!” “For me, it was a good season because I played a lot of games,” Emerson went on. “Of course [it felt good that Chelsea wanted me in January]. Lyon said no, so I didn’t come back. It didn’t depend on me. Those conversations were between the clubs. “Lyon said no and I respected that because when I signed there I signed for one year, not six months. But now I will go back to Chelsea in the pre-season I think and let’s see what happens in the next month.” The west Londoners begin pre-season on July 2 but international players will join the group a week later on July 9. They will then embark on a tour of the United States, facing Club America, Arsenal and Charlotte FC.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-s-palmieri-unsure-on-future-but-happy-to-return-to/blt2d7d301625745fa0,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

10934,The Half-Back? How John Stones’ Hybrid Role Defines Manchester City’s Build-Up,"We all know the routine when Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City play another big side, usually in the Champions League. Some of us open Twitter, scroll through a bunch of tweets that either say “Guardiolismo continues to break positional play paradigms” or “Fraudiola’s overthinking it again!”, before heading over to see how City’s official account lines them up. Others open their favourite football app and look at what formation the app decrees. And, inevitably, it’s never 100% correct. In recent months, this confusion over what formation Man City are playing has seemingly increased. Some apps or media outlets line City’s players up in a good ol’ 4-3-3 while others are brave enough to list it as a 3-2-4-1, the shape that City tend to use with the ball this season. Most of this confusion comes down to where you choose to place John Stones. Is he a part of the central defensive pairing or is he a part of the double pivot? Of course, we know that players’ positions and roles are becoming increasingly fluid in the modern game and that teams’ formations with and without the ball are becoming increasingly distinct. We also know all about inverted full-backs who move into midfield from a nominal full-back spot. But confusion over whether someone plays as a centre-back or a central midfielder is relatively new to us.  And this uncertainty highlights just how unique Stones’ new role is at Manchester City. When City have the ball in and around their box, Stones is in a central defensive pairing… …but when City move up the pitch, so does Stones, unmistakably a part of their midfield box and often venturing into the attacking third. On the other hand, when City don’t have the ball, Stones’ positioning is far more conventional, as a central defender in a shape that’s generally 4-4-2. This begs the question: why? Why this dual role? Why use a central defender to move into midfield (or use a central midfielder to retreat, whatever way you see it) instead of using an inverted full-back? Exploring Stones’ role opens a window into understanding the way Guardiola’s Manchester City have adapted over the past season and how these changes have brought them to the cusp of a treble.  But first, let’s take a look at precursors to this hybrid role to examine the genealogy of how Guardiola is using Stones. Of course, while Stones’ role may be unique in today’s tactical environment, it isn’t a sudden phenomenon that’s come from nowhere.  A notable recent example – albeit in a different context, turning a back three out of possession into a back four in possession – is Andreas Christensen’s centre-back-plus-defensive-midfielder role for Denmark in Euro 2020, turning Denmark’s 3-4-3 into a 4-3-3. As Om Arvind writes, Christensen stepping up into midfield helped nullify any opposition’s numerical advantages in the middle while also enabling the double pivot in front of him to push up and become de facto number eights. This gave the team an added level of flexibility both in and out of possession. But we can find a more relevant example to which we can trace Stones’ current role. It comes from the final year of Guardiola’s Barcelona spell, his Yeezus season, 2011-12. As Rene Maric and Michael Cox each noted, for most of their derby game against Real Madrid away, Barcelona played something akin to a 3-4-3 diamond shape (with Lionel Messi as the 10 and Alexis Sánchez up front) that turned into a 4-4-2 without the ball as Sergio Busquets dropped into the left-centre-back spot. But why? As Cox writes, starting in a back four shielded Busquets from Real Madrid number 10 Mesut Özil’s pressing and marking in the early stages of the build-up, and pushing him up into midfield gave Barça an extra player in the middle of the pitch, allowing Xavi to push forward when Özil pressed Busquets. Plus, intuitively, having an extra auxiliary centre-back certainly helped quieten the counter-attacking threat of José Mourinho’s Real Madrid. It’s worth noting that a key difference from Stones’ role today is that Busquets seemingly played a more aggressive, front-foot defensive role in the backline compared to Stones, often jumping up a line to pressure the player with the ball. Today, the same fundamental advantages apply to Stones’s role in City’s setup, but with a couple of nuances that come with the way the game’s changed in the decade since Guardiola’s Barça. As Jon Mackenzie describes in his video for Tifo IRL, one trend at the highest level of football this season is that several high-possession elite sides are increasingly converging towards using four players in midfield, arriving to a vaguely 3-2-4-1 shape with the ball in different ways, usually from a base 4-3-3 formation. The advantage of having four in the middle boils down to the simple fact that you outnumber your opposition in midfield, with man-marking-based pressing systems having to adjust in a way that twists their defensive shape and creates spaces for other attackers to exploit. What makes Guardiola’s City – unsurprisingly, at the vanguard of this box midfield wave – different, especially of late, is the way that they arrive at this shape. Most teams tend to arrive at a 3-2-4-1 shape by moving a full-back inside (like Oleksandr Zinchenko at Arsenal) or by moving a full-back high up the pitch (like Alejandro Balde at Barcelona). However, since the departure of João Cancelo to Bayern Munich, and after a spell of using Rico Lewis as an inverted full-back in possession, which worked pretty well in fairness, Guardiola seems committed to lining up with four nominal centre-backs, with Stones playing in the double pivot for most of the game. If inverted full-backs were hard enough to mark, splitting marking responsibilities between opposition wingers and attacking midfielders, a marauding centre-back is even harder to mark, especially as more elite teams move towards man-marking in midfield. A player who starts at the centre of the backline isn’t usually followed across the pitch, and this helps give City an extra player in every phase of possession. To demonstrate, we can look at how easily Stones got on the ball and moved it into dangerous areas in City’s first leg against Real Madrid. Madrid went man-to-man across most of the pitch, with two centre-backs on Erling Haaland, both full-backs marking the wingers, wingers tracking the wide centre-backs, and the midfield occupying City’s nominal midfield trio of Rodri, Ilkay Gündoğan, and Kevin de Bruyne. Stones usually found himself in space, easily getting past Karim Benzema’s rudimentary covering. When Stones got on the ball, this usually unsettled Madrid’s marking duties, with a midfielder jumping to press Stones, leaving another City midfielder free. In the below example, Luka Modrić jumps to press Stones, which opens up a one-two with Rodri, which enables Stones to carry the ball into the box. In addition to what Stones does with the ball in space, a key advantage of him being a member of the midfield box is simply down to what he allows his midfield partners to do. When he ventures forward, he occupies an opposition midfielder and creates space for one of his teammates to drop into. Stones’ security with and without the ball at the base of the midfield helps free up Manchester City’s advanced midfielders more, with De Bruyne and Gündoğan playing freer, more advanced roles than ever.  But of course, while Stones may just be better with the ball at his feet, it looks like there’s another reason to use him as a centre-back-plus-midfielder versus using Rico Lewis as an inverted full-back. And that’s because Stones’ role provides even more security when City lose the ball… Guardiola’s sides have always attempted to play expansive, possession-based football with numbers up front while also placing a heavy emphasis on preventing counter-attacks when they do lose the ball. But this season, Manchester City are a slightly different team.  With the signing of Erling Haaland, City use a conventional striker up front again, and while City now play with the most prolific goalscorer in the world, their style of play has had to slightly adapt to Haaland’s profile. Having a striker who specialises in running in behind adds an emphasis on playing riskier passes in behind the opposition in the final third, which naturally means that City have more turnovers to prepare for. This calls for an even greater focus on passing the ball around with a shape that helps defend counter-attacks better. The basic logic of using inverted full-backs is that it helps prevent the opposition’s threat on the counter. When your full-backs are deeper and narrower than conventional overlapping full-backs, it’s easier for them to retreat to defend the counter-attack when you lose the ball. When they start closer to the central areas of the pitch, they’re guaranteed to be closer to the most crucial areas of the pitch to defend as soon as the ball is lost. As a result, inverted full-backs have been a constant feature of Guardiola’s sides, especially since his Bayern Munich days. Right now, however, when he needs it even more, Guardiola may have an even more effective way to prevent counter-attacks. As exotic as pushing a centre-back into midfield sounds, Stones starts with three other centre-backs beside or behind him. At the moment that City lose the ball, they have three centre-backs and at least one of Stones and Rodri behind the ball and ready to snuff out any potential counter-attack. Plus, when City lose the ball, Stones immediately sprints to retreat and join the backline as a central defender. While he may only be a moderately-fast runner, his starting position, deep and central, ensures that he ends up getting back in time to form a four-centre-back backline and comprehensively stop a counter-attack. This answers another question: why use Stones as a hybrid centre-back-midfielder instead of using him as an inverted right-back as Guardiola has in the past? It’s simply just easier for City to segue from a 3-2-4-1 to a 4-4-2 and vice versa when they lose and win the ball with Stones making shorter vertical movements back and forth. The diagonal retreat and advance back and forth between the double pivot to the full-back spot involves covering more ground, and City have faster defenders who can make up ground in the wide areas better. The speed and physicality of  Manuel Akanji and Nathan Aké makes them better suited to being fielded as wide centre-backs – deep, narrow full-backs out of possession – while Stones stays in the centre. So, does it work?  Well, as Jon Mackenzie notes in his video on the subject, City have conceded fewer direct attacks since they started using Stones in his new role, going from 1.2 to 0.6 per game. Direct attacks are essentially proxies for counter-attacks: they measure the number of sequences that start just inside a team’s defensive half that have at least 50% of movement towards the opposition’s goal and end in a shot or a touch in the opposition box. City are conceding fewer of those than ever before. Similarly, this season, City have slowed down the pace of their opposition’s attacks. Teams progressed the ball upfield against City at 1.47 metres/second last season (10th best in the league). That’s dropped to a sluggish 1.18 m/s this season (the slowest rate in the league). City are also far better at preventing the opposition moving up the pitch from a pure distance perspective, too. In 2021-22, teams averaged 10.9 metres of progression per possession sequence (the third-lowest in the league) and that’s fallen to 9.8 metres on average this season (the lowest in the league). All in all, watching Stones in his new role at City seems to reveal a bunch of simple, mundane benefits of the role rather than an upheaval that ushers in a new paradigm of possession football. But that in itself is significant. The first time that Stones started in this role, Manchester City beat RB Leipzig 7-0 in the Champions League’s round of 16. The average number of goals City have scored in a game this season since the switch has gone up to 3.2 from a previous 2.3 per game. Considering how vanguard a centre-back who moves into midfield sounds, you’d be forgiven for thinking that this role is a swashbuckling attacking invention. But there’s another change in the simple stats that maybe helps us understand the value of Stones’ role better. Ever since the change in role, City have conceded just 0.5 goals per game down from 0.9, a decrease of 41%. While we can’t attribute all improvement to one factor changing, Stones’ new role has accompanied a noticeable tightening of City’s defence while the attack also continues to flourish. Apart from how exotic a centre-back in midfield sounds, Stones’ new role seems to be a practical solution to City’s squad changing with the departure of Zinchenko and Cancelo, who were staples of the side as inverted full-backs.  Compared to using Lewis or even Bernardo Silva as an inverted full-back, playing Stones in this role is more conservative, and allows City to field an extra central defender without the ball who can defend the channels better. And as Guardiola himself mentioned after City’s title victory against Chelsea, having extra centre-backs on the pitch better prepares his team to win individual duels. Only Aké (67.5%) has a better overall duel success rate than Stones (67.3%) in a City shirt this season. 🗣️ “I learned this season when you play against [Bukayo] Saka, Vinícius [Júnior], these type of wingers, [Gabriel] Martinelli or [Mohamed] Salah or [Sadio] Mané in the past that you need proper defenders to win duels 1 against 1.” Pep Guardiola on changing his defensive system pic.twitter.com/t2p0aH509m And that’s what it boils down to: playing Stones as a centre-back-plus-midfielder ensures that City have an extra player in midfield in attack and an extra centre-back in the early build-up and in defence. We hear the phrase ‘numerical superiority’ each time Guardiola’s tactical approach is discussed, and Stones’ role is a pragmatic next step that gives City an extra player in more situations, allowing them to attack in numbers while having less to worry about when they lose the ball. So, all that leaves us with one final question: what the heck do we call this role? Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

114,Both teams to score weekend accumulator,"Valencia have scored in their last 19 home league games but have conceded in five of their last six. Elche, meanwhile, have scored in eight of their last 10 competitive games and there should be plenty of interest in backing goals and both ends of this regional derby, particularly at the healthy-looking price quoted. Two of the top scoring teams in Serie A meet this weekend and goals at both ends look guaranteed. Both teams to score has paid out in eight of Verona's last nine league clashes, while proving profitable in 10 of Atalanta's last 12 games in the Italian top flight. Indeed, Gianpiero Gasperini's men have netted in 37 of the 41 league matches they have played in 2021 and can almost always be relied upon to be involved in high-scoring encounters. The visitors have been one of the most consistent scorers in the Premier League and have netted in 10 of their last 11 games, including against both Manchester clubs as well as Tottenham and West Ham. Liverpool, meanwhile, have conceded in five of their last 10 top-flight games, while scoring in 25 successive games and the price offered for goals at both ends at Anfield offers value. The visitors are one of the most in-form sides in the Bundesliga with five wins from their last six matches, while Freiburg have been one of the most consistent scorers in the division netting in 11 of their 14 clashes. Both teams to score paid out in both meetings between these sides last season and should have a terrific chance of doing so once more this weekend. Odds correct at the time of writing.

Their centre-backs like to play, building up and controlling ball possession, trying to get good combinations on the pitch.""Luke Shaw is very dangerous and Diogo Dalot is in a good moment. Casemiro is a very important player for them; they have very good wingers and strikers and that is my concern.""Onana has struggled to win over United fans. In an error-laden seven months, he has kept only 10 clean sheets in 33 games, conceding 32 times in the Premier League alone. However, the Cameroonian was solid in the win over West Ham, picking up his seventh clean sheet in the league.

8370,Millwall 0-4 Ipswich: Tractor Boys thump Lions to return to winning ways,"Ipswich moved to within three points of the Sky Bet Championship automatic promotion places as they returned to winning ways by thrashing struggling Millwall 4-0. Kieran McKenna's early season challengers had won just one in nine league games but survived a slow start to run out deserved victors at The Den. Nathan Broadhead scored one and made another in the first half while in-form Bournemouth loanee Kieffer Moore headed home and Ali Al-Hamadi converted a stoppage-time penalty as Ipswich eased to just a second league win of the calendar year. Despite their drop-off in form, McKenna's side lost just twice in that run and the former Manchester United assistant will be hoping this result heralds a return to form - with a trip to Swansea next up on Saturday. Millwall started the better of the two sides and the recalled Ryan Leonard hammered an effort over the crossbar after an early corner was cleared to the edge of the Ipswich box. The home side showed four changes from their loss at Coventry and another returnee came close on four minutes as George Saville's drive was saved by Vaclav Hladky.

Championship Table Find out more about Sky Sports Hladky was forced into action again to save low from Leonard as Millwall maintained their head of steam. But despite their dominance, Joe Edwards' men fell behind at the midway point of the first half with Broadhead's accurate back-header from Omari Hutchinson's cross putting Ipswich ahead against the run of play. The lead was doubled soon after as Harding inadvertently turned Broadhead's low cross into his own goal. The points were all-but secured on the stroke of half-time, Moore heading into the ground and over Sarkic for his third goal in as many games. The second half was a much more even affair as Millwall matched their visitors, who had taken their foot off the gas. Still, though, the home side could not find a way to beat Hladky, the former Salford keeper going largely untested after the interval other than preventing a Bradshaw consolation. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ipswich could have extended their advantage as Wes Burns and Conor Chaplin had decent chances before referee Sam Barrott pointed to the spot for a Murray Wallace foul on substitute Al-Hamadi. The January signing from AFC Wimbledon dusted himself down to score his first goal for his new club. While Ipswich continue to look up, Edwards has now seen his side take just one point from their last six league games and - with Stoke and Huddersfield both winning - they have dropped to 21st in the table.

Statistically, in the last nine games we have been creating more shots and having less against than in the first nine games but sometimes football works like that. ""We were clinical and we produced the defensive moments whenever we needed to, we have been long overdue a night where things went our way. ""It was a good night's work, a good performance in different areas.

1102,Afcon 2021: Cech tips Mendy and Senegal to lift title in Cameroon,"Chelsea legend Petr Cech has backed goalkeeper Edouard Mendy to guide Senegal to their first-ever Africa Cup of Nations title in Cameroon. The Lions of Teranga reached the quarter-finals of the competition after beating Cape Verde 2-0 in the Round of 16 with Liverpool forward Sadio Mane and Bamba Dieng of Ligue 1 club Marseille notching the goals at Stade Omnisports de Bafoussam. Writing in his weekly column, Cech suggested the 29-year-old custodian, who recently won the Fifa Best goalkeeper award, will win more trophies this year among them the Afcon title as Senegal are among the favourites. “Edou was named The Best goalkeeper by Fifa and it’s another great achievement for him,” Cech wrote on Chelsea's official website. “He is the first African goalkeeper to win the award, which is amazing, and testament to how well he has done since he came to our club. “He had an incredible year, winning two trophies, and it reflects his hard work and attitude. It’s great to see him getting recognition and our other players who made it to the Team of the Year. ”The best thing is Edou can now add more trophies this year. He is at the Africa Cup of Nations now, Senegal are one of the favourites, so he could even win this trophy before he returns to us. “And then we have the Club World Cup and the Carabao Cup final to look forward to in a few weeks. Hopefully, for him, he will be on the right end of three more trophies.” Mendy missed the opening two Group B matches for Senegal – 1-0 win against Zimbabwe and 0-0 draw against Guinea –after testing positive for Covid-19. He, however, recovered in time to face Malawi where he managed to keep a clean sheet in a 0-0 draw and was in goal when they beat the Blue Sharks 2-0 to advance to the last eight. The Lions of Teranga are making their 16th appearance at the Afcon finals, and it’s a record for a team that has never won the trophy. The closest they came to winning the tournament was in 2002 when they lost the final on penalties against Cameroon and in 2019 when they lost 1-0 to Algeria in another final.

490,Lionel Messi’s trick shot Adidas advert: Is it real or fake and what boots is he wearing?,"Widely recognised as one of the world’s best ever footballers, Lionel Messi has been the face of Adidas football since his emergence and continues to be, as seen in their latest trick shot video. As brilliant as Messi is with a ball at his feet, even some of his biggest fans could be left contemplating the truthfulness of his trick shots in this video, while wearing Adidas’ latest football boots. So is it real and what new boots is he wearing? GOAL takes a look. The video itself shows Messi launching the ‘Al Rihla’ ball, which will be used at the 2022 World Cup, into the ball bag three times in a succession. He then strolls away and giving his approval with a thumbs up. Notably, the camera then pans towards Messi's boots - the Diamond Edges - which are the actual subject of the video. Thus far, neither Messi nor Adidas have commented on whether or not the video is bona fide or if it has been edited. Interestingly, the video itself is reminiscent of one in which former Manchester United and Real Madrid star David Beckham starred in, where he was asked to kick three balls into three separate bins. Despite Beckham’s amazing talents, fans remain convinced that the clip was indeed edited, given the difficulty of the challenge, and the Messi clip has elicited a similar reaction. Unsurprisingly, fans in the comments sections of the video have already begun debating this, with some labelling him as 'The GOAT’ and commenting that it’s too easy for him. Others have questioned if it is real and even praised the editing of the video. Messi is wearing Adidas’ Diamond Edge boots, which come in a dark blue, light blue and white colourway. As you can tell in the caption of the video which reads ""1, 2, 3, feeling good in Diamond Edge."" That particular pair comes in a collection of Diamond Edge boots, which you can view on the official Adidas website. Do you think the video is real or fake?

1496,Arsenal brutally troll Tottenham with 'empty trophy cabinet' online shop message,"Arsenal have had a dig at Tottenham's lack of recent success  - via the unusual route of their online shop. The Gunners' north London rivals have had a hard time winning any trophies in recent years, last lifting the League Cup in 2008. It has been almost 31 years since they last won the FA Cup and they have not been crowned champions of England since they won the First Division in 1961. Arsenal have poked some fun at their local foes by displaying a cheeky message when fans browse their shop. Any attempt to checkout without adding anything to the shopping cart is met with a message that reads: ""Your basket is as empty as Tottenham's trophy cabinet."" Arsenal have said that the message had not been officially approved to appear on their site and would be removed. An official statement from the club read: ""This was posted to the site in error without appropriate checks and approvals and is being removed as quickly as possible."" While Arsenal have had a few rough years recently, they have been much more successful than Spurs. The Gunners have won the English top-flight 13 times, though the most recent occasion was in 2004.  They have had more success in the FA Cup recently, winning it in 2020 for the 14th time to make them the competition's most successful team.

11490,Lampard’s Everton: A Safety-First Approach That May Not Ensure Safety,"In a division fuelled by melodrama, there’s always a crisis going on somewhere in the Premier League. That’s never more true than during the August silly season, when the league table compulsively lies and it becomes the media’s sacred duty – for the sake of the brand – to ignore the rationalists in the corner pleading to acknowledge the small sample size. There are plenty of crisis clubs at the moment, but arguably only one whose cowering start to the 2022-23 campaign reflects tactical flaws that stretch back to the season before – and even to the manager’s previous job. The issues plaguing Frank Lampard’s Everton, namely porousness through central midfield, have been present since his stint as Chelsea manager, when his team’s openness, passivity through the middle, and decompressed formation meant Chelsea were built in his image: a team of Lampards, roaming forward without structural or positional awareness of the counter-attacking space left behind them. His principles at Chelsea were towards high-pressing, high-energy, high-possession football, and the underlying numbers showed he did a decent job of it, at least in his full season in charge. In 2019-20, the Blues ranked in the top five for high turnovers (175), pressed sequences (573), and PPDA (10.6), and in the top three for total 10+ open-play passing sequences (642). However, this came at a cost: too often his team were overly stretched and unable to shield against breaks. This feature has only become more pronounced at Everton, even with a possession share and pressing intensity lower than at Lampard’s Chelsea. The evidence is pretty damning. Over the period of the 2021-22 season in which Lampard was in charge, Everton ranked fourth for total ‘progressive passes against’ with 555, behind only relegated sides Burnley, Norwich City, and Watford. They topped the league for ‘progressive carries against’, with 1462, and their PPDA was 15.5, the fifth highest. In other words, it has been remarkably easy to pass or dribble straight through this team, likely reflecting an absence of detailed coaching that would ensure the overall shape is compressed and regimented to a Premier League standard. These figures are scarcely any different so far in 2022-23, and although, yes, while we shouldn’t look too closely at a small sample size, the data shows something very similar to last year. Worse still, Everton’s team sequence style and zones of control graphics make for grim reading. They rank third bottom for passes per sequence (2.79) and fifth bottom for direct speed (1.29): While their zones of control map shows how easily they are dominated in central areas: The eye test also shows us it’s more of the same. Everton inevitably sat very deep against Chelsea, while Nottingham Forest’s direct football so far this season hid some of Everton’s weaknesses, but the 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa was a perfect example of their brittle central midfield. The first goal resulted from John McGinn being unchallenged by an absent two-man midfield of Abdoulaye Doucouré and Alex Iwobi… While the second goal saw Emiliano Buendía practically walk through the middle after a tackle on Amadou Onana revealed a huge gap between Everton’s defensive and midfield lines… When he first arrived at Everton, Lampard deployed similar tactical principles as at Chelsea, only to then concede territory and introduce a pragmatic backs-against-the-wall system – with a deeper line of engagement – to grind out results in last year’s relegation scrap. A defensive setup, with less pressing from the front, inevitably means close support for the midfield and a more compressed shape. Players shuffle neatly across in their own half, rarely stretching their legs other than for targeted and low-volume counter-attacks. This was what we saw in their 1-0 wins against Manchester United and Chelsea at Goodison Park last season, in which the Toffees averaged 27% possession and 14 touches per game in the opposition box. Lampard appears to have recognised the advantages of a more cautious setup, permanently adjusting his system in 2022-23 to shrink Everton into a conservative formation that minimises the risk of fanning out the midfielders. Significantly, he has switched to a 5-4-1 (the signing of Conor Coady suggests a back five is here to stay) that necessitates compact lines focused on defending within their own half. The stats also show a change is in progress. Everton are actually applying more pressures per game this year (24.84, up from 15.33 under Lampard in 21-22) but these are happening in deeper areas of the pitch: It may already be having a positive effect. Everton allowed 60 shot-ending carries from opponents last season under Lampard, the fifth most in the division, whereas in 2022-23 they have so far allowed just six, which is only the 17th most. This could be an early indication that by dropping deeper and inviting pressure, Everton are creating a stronger barrier against opponents carrying the ball into dangerous areas. Lampard has also sought to address the problem by signing new central midfielders. It doesn’t take a genius to work out that Tom Davies and Iwobi isn’t the most defensively robust duo, hence the acquisition of Onana from Lille and the reported ongoing interest in Paris Saint-Germain’s Idrissa Gueye. Onana’s inauspicious start at Villa shouldn’t worry Evertonians. Last season in Ligue 1 he recorded a 59.5% duel success rate and averaged 2.1 tackles and 2.0 interceptions per 90 – more than any other Everton player in all three metrics. He adds aggression and defensive resilience, as would former Everton midfielder Gueye. In 2018-19, the last time Gueye was playing in the Premier League, he attempted the joint-most tackles in the division with 142. New signings and a somewhat shrunken tactical approach should improve the flaws with Lampard’s Everton, but it may also leave supporters wondering where the project is heading. Rafael Benítez was understandably criticised for his negativity and although Lampard is not operating on the same scale (nor does he come with Liverpool baggage) fans may eventually become restless. Certainly it’s difficult to see Lampard’s tactical recalibration as a long-term solution. It isn’t the vision anyone was sold, and presumably at some point Lampard will want to begin opening up again, especially if he harbours ambitions of climbing back towards the top of the game. If he does so, will the cycle of a porous midfield and draining energy repeat itself? A more immediate concern for Lampard, however, is the lack of points on the board – and the thought that Lampard’s newfound conservatism might be laying the groundwork for Sean Dyche, who waits in the wings. Signing Dwight McNeil and James Tarkowski is just tempting fate. Lampard, hired for an aesthetic he no longer feels able to coach, may be running out of time.

7855,Barca relying on Everton to be relegated from EPL to compete for midfield target,"Barcelona are to look to sign a new defensive midfielder in the summer, given that Oriol Romeu has struggled as Sergio Busquetsâ replacement this season. A top-level player is wanted by Sporting Director Deco, who has listed Evertonâs Amadou Onana as an ideal option for the Catalans.  The problem for Barcelona in regards to Onana is that they are very unlikely to be able to afford him at this stage. Their ongoing financial woes means that they cannot splash out as before, which restricts their ability to sign their ideal targets. There has been talk that Everton would want in the region of â¬60m for Onana, a figure that Barcelona cannot afford. However, as Marca note, the Toffeesâ relegation from the Premier League could well see this asking price drop, which would give the Blaugrana more hope of doing a deal. Everton currently sit in the relegation zone, one point behind Luton Town. Onana would likely push for the exit door if they drop down to the Championship, and Barcelona may need to hope for that if they are to have any chance in securing his signature this summer.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Barca-relying-on-Everton-to-be-relegated-from-EPL-to-compete-for-midfield-target/3301801,,2 days ago,all-football-app
5995,"Liverpool star Salah will never get what he deserves because he is African, Diouf claims amid contract drama","Mohamed Salah’s future at Liverpool continues to make plenty of headlines, as he works on a contract through to 2023, and El Hadji Diouf has warned the Egyptian superstar that he will never get the terms he deserves because he is African. Debate as to whether or not a talismanic figure at Anfield will commit to fresh terms has raged for some time now, with Premier League title hopefuls unable to get an extension agreement over the line. Diouf is hoping that Salah – who has hit 153 goals through 239 appearances on Merseyside – will sign a new deal, as a move to Real Madrid would require him to start from scratch, but he has warned that discussions will be difficult. Diouf, who struggled to make an impact at Liverpool on the back of a transfer in 2002, has told beIN Sports of the saga surrounding an Anfield icon of the present: “It is obvious that Liverpool must accept Salah’s demands. “If I were Salah, I would stay at Liverpool, he can earn more money, he is the best player at the club along with [Sadio] Mane, and with him together they will win a lot of trophies. “He is 29 years old and I ask him to play four more years with the Reds. “A transfer to Real Madrid would mean that he would have to start all over again.” Mohamed Salah becomes the sixth player in Premier League history to score 20+ goals in 4+ seasons 👑 pic.twitter.com/9frGYa6DTy There has been talk of Salah and his representatives demanding as much as £500,000-a-week in order to put pen to paper at Liverpool – although those reports have been refuted. He will clearly be looking for a deal that puts him within the highest earners in world football, as one of the best players on the planet, but Diouf claims players from Africa rarely see their full value recognised. The former Senegal international added: “Salah must realise that he is African, so they will not treat him like the Europeans, and they will not give him the best contract like the others. “The same thing happened to me when I was at Liverpool, they were telling me not to go to away with my country to play with my national team.” Salah has hit 28 goals through 36 outings this season, including a Golden Boot-leading 20 efforts in the Premier League, and Jurgen Klopp’s side – who remain in contention for a historic quadruple in 2022 – will be back in action on April 2 when playing host to struggling Watford.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-salah-never-get-what-he-deserves-because-african-diouf-/blt2d25e9ecc791b888,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2111,Carragher on why he loves Salah's revenge admission and how Liverpool won't be 'starstruck' by Real Madrid,"Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher says that he likes the fact that Mohamed Salah said that he wanted to meet Real Madrid in the Champions League final and that it should give Reds fans confidence that their star winger will be out for revenge. After Liverpool booked their spot in the Champions League final, Salah said that he hoped Madrid, not Manchester City, would meet them in Paris, explaining that he wanted to find some redemption after famously being injured by Sergio Ramos when the two sides met in 2018. Salah's comments drew criticism from Madrid star Fede Valverde, but Carragher, who will be covering the game for CBS Sports, says Salah's honest admission is a breath of fresh air as the Egyptian admitted just how much that 2018 setback hurt him at the time. ""I think it will be a big motivation for him,"" Carragher said. ""I think he was very aggrieved because that was his moment in some ways. He really burst onto the scene, he had been a revelation and the whole world had sat up and taken notice with him scoring I think 44 goals that season. ""The whole campaign for Liverpool was built around this guy winning the Champions League for them and he got Ramos'd, shall we say. Sergio Ramos used his experience, dark arts, whatever you want to call it, in that game and I think that was a huge blow for him really.  ""Players and managers never like to talk about revenge. They don't like to use that word in the press to build up or maybe in some ways motivate the opposition but, really, we all think it! It's something that you just don't say, so I actually admired Mo Salah for actually just being honest to say 'Yeah, I'd rather play Real Madrid and not Man City because Man City are a better team and also because I've got unfinished business'.  ""I liked the fact that he was honest about it and it also makes me realize that he is going to be so determined to win this game and that makes me feel good as a Liverpool supporter. ""Sometimes, you want to play well, do too much really, so I hope it doesn't manifest itself in terms of Mo taking stupid shots from silly angles when he should be playing people in. He does do that from time to time, but I think he's gonna have a huge role to play in the game.  ""He hasn't been as best in the second half of the season. I think he's aware of that. I think you've seen signs of frustration from him at different times. But no, I think he'll feel like this is this is redemption."" Salah isn't the only Liverpool player that will have bad memories of that 2018 final, even if the club returned a year later to beat Tottenham and reclaim the Champions League crown. A total of eight Liverpool starters from that match in Kyiv remain key parts of the current team, but Carragher says that the current group is much different than the one that lost to Real Madrid four years ago. ""Even though there's a lot of Liverpool players that played in that final, I think Liverpool are in a completely different place mentally,"" Carragher said. ""Now, I think they feel like they belong in the Champions League final. I think that's final four years ago, they deserved to be there but it was a case of pulling up against the very famous Real Madrid and Ronaldo, who had won two, three four European cups at that stage. ""I think this is a different Real Madrid even if there are a lot of familiar players in the midfield that were the same on that night. ""I think going into this game, Liverpool will not be starstruck or feel like they're in awe of Real Madrid. I think they'll be very confident and it is different. Liverpool are better and Real Madrid are not as good as that team.  ""As we've seen at times this season within the Champions League, Real Madrid have lost more games or as many games in the Champions League as Liverpool have all season, which shows how strong Liverpool have become since that final four years ago. I think Liverpool have lost three games in 62 this season, which is a phenomenal record. ""I think they'll go into the final in a completely different place mentally than they did four years ago.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/carragher-on-why-he-loves-salah-s-revenge-admission-and-how/blta41d05a54bf65483,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10974,Viktor Gyökeres: The Making of a Coventry Cult Hero,"Just one team stand between Coventry City and a return to the Premier League after a 22-year absence. They face fellow underdogs Luton Town in the Championship play-off final at Wembley on Saturday for a place in the 2023-24 Premier League. Whatever the result, there’s one man you feel cannot lose: Viktor Gyökeres. Should Coventry win, they’ll have a player ready to burst onto the Premier League scene in Sky Blue. Lose, then the top-flight vultures will be scrapping for the undoubted talents of the Swedish forward ahead of August’s season start. While it was Middlesbrough’s Chuba Akpom who won the Championship Player of the Year award this season, no single player has had a greater impact for their club than Gyökeres has for Coventry. Akpom (28) was the only player to better Gyökeres’ 21-goal tally in the Championship this season. Watching his goals from 2022-23, it’s clear that there’s no specific ‘type’ of goal that he’s known for, which is a good thing for a striker who can often be forced to make something out of very little. That’s not a slight on Coventry and the players that surround him in the side, but fans of the club will be the first to admit that their counter-attacking style is only really made effective due to the talents of Gyökeres. Mark Robins’ side thrive in the chaos of transition. If the opponent commit men forward only to lose the ball in the attacking third of the pitch, you best believe that Coventry are going to swarm up the pitch quickly. Gyökeres – quick on the turn, a powerful, fast runner with the ball at his feet and a threat in front of goal – is a major problem for opposition defences when these transitions occur. Coventry have attempted 46 shots from fast breaks in the Championship this season – that’s nearly double the next most prolific side in the competition (Sheffield United & Middlesbrough: 25). The Sky Blues are one of the most direct sides in the Championship across 2022-23. This isn’t to mean that they are a long-ball team – far from it, in fact.  Coventry have a direct speed of 1.68 metres/second – the second highest in the Championship, indicating their ability to hit sides quickly in transition. Interestingly, play-off final opponents Luton are the only side with a higher direct speed (1.81 m/s), making the cat-and-mouse style battle to reach the Premier League on Saturday a mouth-watering prospect for the neutral. Overall, 32% of the distance Coventry have covered in their open-play sequences this season has been upfield – the fifth highest. In contrast, champions Burnley’s directness was only 19%. Looking at Opta’s direct attacks metric allows us to put another number on Coventry’s chaotic transitional play. Direct attacks – the total number of open-play sequences that start just inside the team’s own half, progress at least 50% towards the opposition goal and ends in a shot or a touch in the opposition box – are a Coventry staple. Across 2022-23, they have had 123 of these, which is 46 more than any other side and more than the two automatically-promoted sides combined (Burnley and Sheffield United: 121). Gyökeres is more important to this style than any other Coventry player. Often deployed as a lone striker with plenty of energetic midfielders behind him, the Swede is the first point of contact. He often pulls defenders out wide and attacks the space in behind the opposition, but he also has the strength to hold the ball up and await teammates to support the attack. With Coventry playing the way they do – exploiting large spaces left by opponents following the breakdown of attacking moves – it’ll come as little surprise that Gyökeres leads the Championship for most shot involvements following ball carries (100 – 67 shots, 33 chances created) – a metric that he also led in the division last season as well (83). No Championship player has carried the ball further upfield this season than Gyökeres (4,444m), while his per 90 average (95.2m) is higher than any other regular striker. His pace and power have also helped him lead the Championship this season for pullbacks (20) – his tally is seven more than any other player in the competition. It’s a tactic suited to a side with energetic forwards and midfielders like Gus Hamer, Jamie Allen and Matt Godden making late runs into the box. His ability to run with the ball and use his body strength is nothing new, although it’s clearly an attribute he’s worked hard to improve since arriving in England with Brighton from Swedish second-tier side IF Brommapojkarna. Speaking to Opta Analyst, Simon Rusk – Gyökeres’ former head coach in Brighton’s Under-23s – revealed that he found it hard to believe the club had unearthed such a talent from the Swedish second tier without much competition. “Victor was very physically able and robust despite his young age and a great runner, but you felt that he could only improve once his football insight and technical intelligence grew with time. Those have obviously married up now and he’s become an exceptional Championship player.” Gyökeres scored 11 goals in 12 appearances in five months after joining Brighton in January 2018 as the Seagulls’ youth side won promotion to the top flight of U23 football. According to Rusk, the forward thrived in particular thanks to his ability to drift out the left and cut in onto his strong right foot at pace. The Swede joined Brighton at a time where they were still battling to become a long-standing Premier League side, with his first 18 months on the south coast coinciding with Brighton’s first two Premier League seasons under Chris Hughton – a very different style of play to what we now expect of them under Roberto De Zerbi. With the arrival of Graham Potter in 2019-20, Brighton’s playing style switched to one that wasn’t as suited to Gyökeres, and the club – along with Rusk – decided it was best for him to spend some time on loan playing senior football. A spell at St Pauli in the German second tier was followed by a disappointing period at Swansea City in the first half of 2020-21, when Gyökeres struggled to recover fitness and force his way into the side following a bad bout of Covid. This is where his relationship with Coventry City and Mark Robins began, with the Sky Blues picking him up on loan for the second half of that season. Speaking to Brighton’s website in March 2021, Gyökeres explained how having a boss like Robins – who enjoyed a prosperous career as a top-flight striker in England at Manchester United, Norwich City and Leicester City – was helping him better understand his role as a forward. “He was a decent striker as a player and it’s good to work with somebody who understands my position and can drill into me what is expected,” he said. “He speaks to me about how I can be more effective and gives me little bits of advice on my movement. It’s helpful to have a coach who has played for the likes of Manchester United, because he knows the demands of the very top level and you can learn a lot from that.” The relationship has been a huge success, with Robins clearly extracting the very best out of Gyökeres following a permanent move for a reported £1m ahead of the 2021-22 campaign. Since then, no player has been involved in more Championship goals than he has (54), with his 38-goal tally only surpassed by Aleksandar Mitrović (43, all in one season) and Swansea’s Joël Piroe (41). If there’s any criticism of Gyökeres, it could be his low conversion rate in front of goal. He’s missed more clear-cut chances than any other Championship player since 2021-22, with his tally of 38 some 12 more than the big chances he’s converted (26). His non-penalty shot conversion rate of 13.2% in 2022-23 was well below that of Akpom (25%) and inferior to the Championship’s other leading scorers, in Morris (16.0%), Tom Bradshaw (19.5%) and Nathan Tella (23.6%). However, it’s important to note that Gyökeres has had harder chances on average than each of those players, with his xG per non-penalty shot the lowest of the five (0.12). But Gyökeres is still a work in progress and clearly improving all the time – he only turns 25 years old in June. His importance to Coventry can’t be understated and he undoubtedly holds the keys to victory and any chance of promotion to the Premier League on Saturday against Luton. The Sky Blues are heavily reliant on him in attack, despite a relatively poor run of form in front of goal that’s seen him score just three goals in his last 11 appearances for the club. Not only is he their biggest threat in front of goal, he is also crucial to the creation of chances for his Coventry teammates. Across the Championship, only Middlesbrough’s Ryan Giles (10.6) has a higher xG assisted total than Gyökeres (8.3) from open play this season. In addition, of the 526 sequences leading to a shot in open play for Coventry in 2022-23, Gyökeres has been involved in 248 of these. His 47.2% involvement is more than any other player in the entire Championship. The threat he poses to opponents on his own is clear from his top-level metrics, too. He’s one of only six players to play at least 2,000 minutes of Championship football this season and average three non-penalty shots per 90 minutes, while his average of 7.8 touches in the opposition box per 90 is another league-high and almost unheard off at Championship level. In fact, only Callum Wilson – for Bournemouth in 2014-15 (8.9) – has averaged more touches in the opposition box in a second-tier season across the last 10 campaigns. Overall, 34% of Coventry’s touches in the box this season have been made by Gyökeres. No player at any other club has had more than 20% of their sides’ touches in the opposition box – the next most being Carlton Morris at Luton. His fitness levels are another plus for Coventry and any prospective suitor. Including the play-offs, he’s already played 4,202 minutes of Championship action in 2022-23. Across the last 10 seasons, only seven players will have played more minutes in a league campaign than Gyökeres in 2022-23 should he complete the full 90 minutes on Saturday at Wembley, as expected. Even if Coventry City do complete a remarkable campaign with promotion to the Premier League, there are no guarantees that Gyökeres will begin next season at the club. Now at the peak age for a footballer, this campaign has fully written off the ‘one-season wonder’ tag some had unfairly labelled him with following a successful 2021-22. Top-flight recruitment teams across Europe will have been keeping a close eye on him. Promotion would not only mean a fairytale rise through three leagues in six seasons under Robins to return to the top flight, it’ll also give Coventry a much better chance of keeping hold of a player who would be key to keeping them there. Win on Saturday and Gyökeres’ cult hero status at Coventry City will be secured. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

4482,Mbappe calls for PSG players to 'respect each other' after humbling Monaco defeat,"Kylian Mbappe urged his Paris Saint-Germain team-mates to show more respect and professionalism after suffering a 3-0 defeat at the hands of Monaco.  The Ligue 1 leaders were thrashed on Sunday to increase discontent in the wake of their elimination from the Champions League.  They are still on course to win the title, but Mbappe and captain Marquinhos were not happy with the result or the performance on display at the weekend.  ""We lost to a great team who are playing to get into Europe. They were determined and carried out their game plan,"" ex-Monaco star Mbappe explained to Amazon Prime Video after the final whistle. ""I hope they get into Europe. They deserved to win. ""The goal is to go for the 10th league title. The rest doesn't matter. ""Even if we win 8-0 or 9-0, people will still be thinking about the Champions League. We must remain professional and respect each other. ""We have to respect the fans who support us, the people and our families. You have to respect yourself if you have a shred of respect for what you do."" Brazil defender Marquinhos offered a similarly harsh analysis of his team's showing: stating that if they continued in this vein PSG might even miss out on Ligue 1, where they currently enjoy a 12-point lead at the top over rivals Marseille. ""It's a catastrophe and difficult to digest. It's our worst game of the year,"" he told reporters. ""We're in a tough spell and we can't throw it all away. We have to work together to get out of this moment. ""There were a lot of expectations [against Real Madrid] and the defeat hurt us. We still have goals to chase. If we keep performing like this, the title will be in danger.

2745,"Rangnick reveals Man Utd refused to move for Luis Diaz, Julian Alvarez & Vlahovic in January transfer window","Ralf Rangnick says the Manchester United board shut down his request to sign a forward in the January transfer window. United have had selection problems in attack in the second half of the season, having allowed Anthony Martial to join Sevilla on loan and lost Mason Greenwood following his arrest on suspicion of rape, assault and threats to kill. Marcus Rashford and Edinson Cavani have not been able to fill the gap whenever Cristiano Ronaldo has not been available, which has prompted Rangnick to use Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes in the front line on occasion. Rangnick says he urged the club to land an attacker and pointed out that Dusan Vlahovic, who ended up at Juventus, Luis Diaz - now at Liverpool - and incoming Manchester City forward Julian Alvarez were all available. He told reporters: ""The answer at the time was no, there was no player on the market that could really help us. [But] there were a few: Diaz who is now at Liverpool, Alvarez who will be at Manchester City in the summer, Vlahovic who at the time still was with Fiorentina.  ""Those are just three of them that come across my mind now,"" said Rangnick.  ""We had four days off at the time and on the Sunday I was informed about the issues with Mason Greenwood and obviously Anthony Martial had already left and then I was aware that within four days we had some strikers missing and it might make sense. ""We were still in three competitions - Champions League, FA Cup and fourth in the league, but that's in the past and it doesn't help us anymore. ""I spoke to the board and said 'shouldn't we at least speak and try and analyse if we could get a player either on loan or as a permanent deal', but in the end the answer was no. ""I still believe that we should have at least tried. If we would've found and been able in 48 hours, 48 hours is short notice but it's still 48 hours. It might have been worth to try and internally discuss but we didn't and it was not done."" With a place in next season's Champions League out of their reach and no trophies to fight for, United are coming to the end of a disappointing campaign. But Rangnick believes there is a silver lining as the extent of their troubles have been exposed and he hopes new coach Erik ten Hag can help fix the club. ""If there is a good thing about the poor season we had so far it is that everybody now should be aware how big and where the problems are, what needs to be done to raise the level again and to be a serious title contender again. ""This is what it's all about. To me, it's obvious what needs to be done, this is what is most important,"" he added. ""Now it's time to look ahead, now we have two games to try to play as well as we possibly can, get as many points as we possibly can out of those two games and then together with Erik, together with the board, together with the scouting department, hopefully find and also convince the players. ""It's not only about finding them, scouting them, you also have to convince them to come to Manchester United.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rangnick-reveals-man-utd-refused-to-move-for-luis-diaz/bltfcc35fb5624e0435,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10392,From Girona to La Roja: The Rise of Aleix Garcia,"Girona Futbol Club have been in existence for 93 years, and it took all 93 of them to see one of their players earn a call-up for the Spanish national team. On 16 November, just under a week after earnin­g the call, Aleix García became the first player in the club’s history to don the shirt of La Roja. Turns out, to break a 93-year record, you need to be pretty special… Aleix García’s national team call-up is symbolic of the way things are going for Girona at the moment. La Liga’s current leaders have taken 34 of a possible 39 points this season, scored more goals than anyone else (31), and only failed to win against two Champions League sides.  They’re the best team in Spanish football as it stands, and they’ve got a good claim to playing better football than anyone else too. As for García, he could argue he’s playing better football than any midfielder in Spain not named Jude Bellingham. And, well, there’s no shame in being second there. Though they are wildly different types of players, what the pair of them share is the ability to affect the game across every third of the pitch. Bellingham conquers through a combination of physicality, force of play, and expressive on-ball talent, while García pairs a smoothing of play in the first two thirds with a quality of final ball that few can rival. Where Bellingham has made the difference himself, García has positioned his teammates to make the difference. And there can be no greater appraisal of that than seeing where Girona currently are. It’s hard to believe now, but Girona started this season with doubts about how they were going to fare following the departure of Oriol Romeu to Barcelona. The 32-year-old was Míchel’s rock in midfield last season; the player who balanced the team with and without the ball, and through whom the Girona boss would translate his messages to the pitch. In his absence, it was logical to think the team’s structure would suffer. By the time the season began, Girona’s solution for replacing Romeu had been a novel one: to not replace him at all. Given the task of finding a player with defensive presence and the requisite technical ability on their modest budget, they decided to work in the opposite direction. It wasn’t about chasing the lost defensive attributes or the command that Romeu emanated, it was about modifying their approach to be able to play a different game; one in which they would have less need for what they were losing. A series of alterations were made for that to occur. García was brought back to a more permanent role at the base of midfield, while Girona’s centre-back profiles changed drastically following the arrival of possession specialists Daley Blind and Eric García. Míchel’s bet was centred on ramping up their control of play and territory, so that Romeu’s role as the anchor and layer of defensive protection wouldn’t be as necessary. If they could be sharper on the ball, play further from their own goal, and position themselves more optimally to recover the ball once they lost it, the necessity for a specialist anchor would be diminished. “With Aleix, what we’ve got now is about trying to keep the opposition deeper and in their defensive third, so that our pressing after a turnover is more energetic from back to front,” Míchel explains. Thirteen games into the season, the league leaders are the team who’ve made the biggest jump from 2022-23 in terms of lengthening their spells of play. Girona have averaged just over 13 sequences of 10+ passes per game in open play this season, up from 9.5 last season. On average, they move the ball upfield slower than anyone else in La Liga. And what’s more, they’re averaging 11.6 seconds per sequence of play this term – a league-high increase on last season (+1.5s). If that doesn’t sound like much, ask yourself how many times you’ve heard managers referring to players having less and less time to make decisions. Add that extra one-and-a-half seconds up over the course of thousands of sequences of play, over the course of a season, and it’s a drastically different situation on the pitch. Girona have – quite literally – accelerated their rise by slowing themselves down. For García, that extra second of possession has been frankly terrible news for the rest of La Liga. Within Girona’s new structure, the 26-year-old has settled into a quarterback role where he flits between directing the flow of traffic in the build-up, providing continuity to the play, and, most devastatingly, using his panoramic view of the pitch to pick apart the opposition’s shape from the outside. He leads all players in La Liga for completed passes this term (867). Not since 2016-17 has a midfielder held onto that spot by the end of the season without playing for either Real Madrid or Barcelona. If you have a winner of duels there, maybe you don’t need to have more control of the play, because [Romeu’s] going to recover the ball. Now, we know that Aleix García has other characteristics. Clearly the centre-backs that have arrived also have other characteristics to Santi Bueno, for example, or Juanpe or Bernardo… they’re different players. So, I had to mould the idea that we have, provided that we continue being competitive in my idea of seeing the game. Evidently, for a team averaging 2.4 goals per game this season, Girona playing a slower and more deliberate game doesn’t mean that’s their only setting. Their management of tempo is based on the picture in front of them and what the opposition is doing. When eventually that landscape opens up and a decision is made to go, Girona eat up the grass as quickly as anyone. And most of the time, it’s a journey that begins from the boots of García. Given the improved security on the ball provided by their centre-back trio, Girona are comfortable in committing players forward and occupying the opposition with up to six attackers across the width of the pitch. In the space in between, García is the man with the best view in the house and the best right foot in Spanish football. From his featured role at the genesis of Girona’s attacks – often occupying the ‘one’ in their 3-1-6 – the 26-year-old has become the director of Spain’s most fluent team. The main way in which García differentiates himself as a passer is through his longer distribution, but not merely that he has the capability to spray the ball to all corners of Montilivi. What makes his distribution special is that his unlimited range doesn’t come at the expense of efficiency. The 26-year-old passes with ambition while managing to retain the ball as if he were playing a safe game. “The best pass is to the player furthest from you, but you have to know how to interpret it,” he told El País in March. While Girona are dominating at close quarters, García is the reliever that the opposition fear – the one who can flip a short passing sequence into an attack 60 yards away. Indeed, the difficulty of containing the Catalan side is apparent through their excellence in combining at close quarters, while also being able to change the point of attack in an instant through García. With the growing importance of out-of-possession approaches – especially when facing teams skilled in the art of build-up – the Girona man is the antidote to the opposition leaving a man unmarked on the opposite side of the pitch. Using maximum width is a permanent feature of Míchel’s team, and through García, they have the means to use every last bit of it. He has made more successful switches of play than anyone else in Europe’s big five leagues this season (29) – already just four fewer than in the whole of last term – and most of them are the long, lofted diagonals that change their attacking dynamic. In fact, when it comes to accessing wide players with those longer passes that arrive in less protected spaces, Girona’s receivers might well be the most grateful in Europe. García has found right winger Yan Couto with a long ball on 30 occasions this season, the most by a player for a specific teammate in Europe’s top five leagues. The winger who’s received the next-most on the list? That’d be the guy on the other side – Sávio – whom García has connected with 27 times over that longer distance. Sávio, to highlight him for a second, has been one of the revelations in La Liga this season. The Brazilian winger is a self-sufficient talent in many ways, but he’s also benefitted enormously from the conditions that García, in particular, provides for him as a passer. With the teenager often holding maximum width on the left side, he has to trust in his teammates to be able to deliver the ball to where he is, rather than him going looking for it. “It’s true that we train a lot on the idea of generating space inside to [then] play out wide and generate 1-v-1s,” Míchel says. For the Brazilian, that process of involvement could hardly be going better. He leads all players in La Liga this season for expected assists (4.1), while only Bryan Zaragoza (37) has completed more take-ons than him (30).  What’s interesting about Sávio’s impact as a creator is that 30 players have created more chances than him this term (15), and yet he still leads the league in overall chance quality, in terms of expected assists. Girona don’t generate overwhelming volume through their wingers. Instead, they find them at optimal moments for them to do maximum damage. With his role in feeding those players, García tops the charts in La Liga this term for both secondary chances created (20) and secondary assists (5) – essentially, the pass that comes directly before either a chance is created, or an assist is made. It is football’s equivalent of setting the table. Oriol [Romeu] used his body; Aleix [García] uses the speed of his gestures, his touch… Oriol was able to control a ball with somebody on top of him, turn and keep it. Aleix, in that type of duel, isn’t so much of a winner, but Aleix positions himself so that before the pressure arrives, he can already find a pass. With their growing reputation as an attacking force, Girona are now – naturally – facing more situations of being camped in the opposition half. That’s what Míchel wanted, remember, and it comes through his side being increasingly able to pen their opponents in, along with opponents being concerned enough to prioritise limiting space over other out-of-possession ambitions. It’s a reality that shifts the context for a player like García, whose work usually plays out at the base of midfield. The problem for Girona’s opposition is the closer García gets to goal, what before was a passing threat, then becomes a threat of dangerous ball striking. Of the many different ways in which the great distributors exact their game, García’s is rooted in his variety of techniques. When he’s closer to goal, those floated strokes around the park give way to devastating connections. The 26-year-old is playing in a deeper, more directorial role this season, and yet ironically, he’s chipping in with goals more than ever. He’s scored three times in La Liga this campaign, after scoring just once in 30 games last term, and zero in 42 games in their promotion campaign of 2021-22. His three goals this season have been scored by an average distance of 17.4 yards, with only Take Kubo (four) netting more times from at least 15 yards. Two of the three, meanwhile, proved to be game-winning goals – that’s an extra four points directly from the midfielder’s right foot. García’s striking from distance is representative of Girona’s varied attacking threat, in that without it being critical to their play, it’s a facet of their game opponents can’t afford to ignore. With the number of players the Catalan side flood the box with, opponents can fall into the trap of leaving space on the edge of the box for García to sneak into. Indeed, for his winner at Cádiz earlier in the season, Míchel remarked after the game that they had planned for cut-backs to the edge of the box for García, given how well the home side were defending their area. And on a day where their usual avenues of attack didn’t produce, it was his strike from a cut-back that secured the points. In many ways, that winner at Cádiz was essentially a set play from open play. The fact it was a successful one doesn’t come as a surprise, for another aspect of Girona’s play where García’s ball striking alters their potency is – you guessed it – set-pieces. If you’re holding onto dreams of the Catalan side ‘doing a Leicester’ this season, you’ll be pleased to hear they’re a menace from them. Girona aren’t the top scorers in that aspect in La Liga this season, but they do have the highest xG from set-pieces (5.3), when excluding penalties. For a team who aren’t exactly littered with six-foot players or aerial specialists in defence, Míchel’s side find their value there through changing the angles of delivery, but mostly through the pure quality of delivery. Here’s Aleix making life pretty easy for another García (Eric), with a textbook punched cross: 🎁 Caramel de l’Aleix i cop de cap de l’Eric per situar-nos LÍDERS de PRIMERA! 😍#VillarrealGirona | #LaLigaHighlights | @LaLiga pic.twitter.com/yUpa4yjTCY Well, we made it this far before finding a category of distribution that the Girona midfielder isn’t top of. He ranks second in La Liga this season for successful corners into the box (14), behind Isco (17), who also narrowly beats him out for corners with a shot attempt on first contact. If it weren’t for that international call-up, he could have spent the last two weeks working on corners at La Vinya. All in all, García’s season so far has been an exhaustive display in how many ways a distributive midfielder can affect a game of football. The 26-year-old is the embodiment of Girona themselves, pairing incision with precision, and continually creating hazards that their opponents need to prepare for. What’s clear is, if you want to stop Girona this season, you’re probably going to have to stop Garcíá first. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new football newsletter to receive exclusive weekly content.

3524,USMNT goalkeeper Horvath hints at transfer away from Nottingham Forest ahead of club's Premier League return,"U.S. men's national team goalkeeper Ethan Horvath hinted that he could leave Nottingham Forest ahead of the club's return to the Premier League. Horvath helped the club return to English soccer's top flight as Nottingham Forest won the promotion playoff, with the American featuring 11 times in all competitions. But, even with the club returning to the Premier League, Horvath knows he'll need playing time if he wants to secure a World Cup spot, and he could leave Forest in search of that playing time. Horvath ended the season as a backup, with Brice Samba emerging as the team's starting goalkeeper throughout the Championship season. Prior to his time at the English club, Horvath featured for Club Brugge, starting semi-regularly before the arrival of former Liverpool No.1 Simon Mignolet in 2019. With Matt Turner and Zack Steffen all but penciled onto the World Cup squad, Horvath finds himself in a competition for that third spot. Sean Johnson may be in pole position for that spot after shining in a start against Uruguay, but Horvath is set to start for the U.S. in the upcoming Nations League clash with El Salvador. ""There is the uncertainty and I don't 100% know what will happen,"" Horvath said. ""Going into this summer period, my main objective is is to play and I know that yes, the World Cup is coming around and that is part of the reason why I want to play but to be honest, I just want to play again, the feel that adrenaline and those butterflies and just that gameday feeling day in and day out.  ""We'll see what happens. We're in close contact with Nottingham and whatever happens, happens there. The main objective is to play, with Nottingham or somewhere else."" With just a few months remaining before World Cup rosters need to be finalized, Gregg Berhalter still has a lot to determine at the goalkeeper position. Matt Turner and Zack Steffen seem like the two vying for the starting role, while veterans Horvath and Sean Johnson remain in the mix for that third spot.  Youngster Gabriel Slonina also has a chance to make the squad, having recently declared for the U.S. over Poland. There's plenty of soccer to play until then, and some potential transfers, so Berhalter says he has plenty of evaluating left to do. ""Every roster spot is going to be carefully considered and what's worked in the past may not work now,"" Berhalter said of his goalkeepers. ""I've seen Spain where they've taken a really old goalkeeper because he means a lot to the group. I see other teams take young goalkeepers and for us, nothing's set in stone right now.  ""What we know is we want guys that can perform up to the level and be the guys that are bought into the team ethos and fit the culture of our group. We'll make a decision based on those two parameters and hopefully we get it right.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/usmnt-goalkeeper-horvath-hints-at-transfer-away-from/blt29b962055bd4ae55,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7309,'You see his real worth' - Rudiger praises Benzema and recalls Champions League triumph with Chelsea,"Antonio Rudiger has hailed Real Madrid star Karim Benzema as the best striker in the world. Benzema is in the best form of his career with Madrid, having scored 44 goals in as many games in all competitions this season. The 34-year-old has earned praise from current and former stars, with Mesut Ozil, Ronaldo and Bruno Genesio speaking highly of him. Rudiger, who will join Madrid from Chelsea this summer, is the latest to sing the praises of his future team-mate, telling DAZN: ""How long has he been at Madrid now, 12 years? That says it all. ""He also had lows and times when he really wanted to leave, but he stayed and it shows how strong his character is. ""Also the thing with the French national team: He is no longer called up and meanwhile wins four Champions League titles. Chapeau what he achieves! ""Since Cristiano Ronaldo's gone, you see his real worth. For me he is currently the best striker. He has everything, his understanding of the game is incredible."" Rudiger will depart Chelsea after spending five years with the club, in which time he has lifted the FA Cup, Europa League and Champions League. The Blues beat Manchester City 1-0 to claim the latter trophy last season and Rudiger looked back on the intense second half and his famous block against Kevin De Bruyne. ""That was a long 45 minutes plus! In the 60th minute I was like: 'Oh dear, is it still that long?' There were so many blocks and tackles in that half - we really fought for our lives,"" he said. ""I'll make it clear that I wanted to block [De Bruyne], but not in a way that knocked him out. It's not my style. I like to play hard, but I haven't seen a red card in five years. ""A lot of people talked about the scene afterwards, but I didn't care because I didn't do it on purpose.  ""I called and texted him afterwards to apologise. He said that everything was fine and that he knew me. I also apologised via social media and quickly made it clear that it was definitely not on purpose."" Asked about the mood in the dressing room after the match, Rudiger said: ""I was mentally broken. I just sat there with N'Golo Kante – because of our religion a bit away from alcohol – we looked at each other and didn't say anything.  ""At some point N'Golo started to laugh, and when he laughs, tears come to his eyes and everyone automatically laughs their heads off.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rudiger-benzema-champions-league-chelsea/blt3d33deef1b58d6e7,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11677,All or Nothing: Portugal’s Make-or-Break Week,"“In 2014, I made a commitment with Fernando Gomes {FPF president} that the day I didn’t reach my goals, I would leave.” On Thursday, Portugal will face off against Turkey in a 2022 FIFA World Cup play-off semi-final. Should A Seleção progress, they will face the winner of Italy versus North Macedonia in the play-off final just three days later. After the dizzying highs of winning their first international tournament at Euro 2016 as well as adding a second to the trophy cabinet in the form of the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, Portugal have somehow found themselves, yet again, involved in a play-off and face the very real prospect of not making it to the World Cup in Qatar. You have to go back to 1998 for the last time Portugal failed to qualify for a World Cup. It was a time when the national team was establishing itself on the international stage, dubbed by the Portuguese media as Geração de Ouro or The Golden Generation. Portugal’s failure to make the 1998 edition meant that this crop of incredible talent – players such as Luís Figo, Rui Costa, Jorge Costa, Vítor Baía and João Vieira Pinto – would have to watch the tournament as mere spectators. After winning both the 1989 and 1991 editions of the FIFA Under-20 World Cup, the nation finally had a generation of players that they could believe in – one they expected to put Portuguese football firmly on the map. They reached Euro 96 with ease, topping their qualification group and despite this being just their second participation in the European Championship finals, they reached the quarter-finals. Despite a solid foundation to build upon, Portugal crashed out of qualifying for the 1998 World Cup, losing out to Germany and Ukraine to finish third in their group – never recovering from a poor start thanks to a draw away in Armenia before losing to Ukraine in Kyiv. Undoubtedly their most talented group of players since 1966 had missed out on appearing at the most prestigious football tournament. Fast forward to 2022 and Portugal could very feasibly suffer the same fate as that late-90s side. This time around however, it would be an even worse failure should they fail to make it, given that this side is often regarded by many as man-for-man, the greatest Portugal side in history. With world class talent all over the pitch, if this crop does in fact miss out, they will certainly go down as one of the most talented squads ever to not make it to a World Cup. Ahead of their playoff tie, how have they found themselves in this predicament? On paper, Portugal’s route to the 2022 World Cup wasn’t the hardest. Serbia, Republic of Ireland, Luxembourg and Azerbaijan were the four opposing sides that stood in their way in Group A – Serbia had only qualified for one of the last five major international tournaments, Ireland hadn’t made a World Cup since 2002 and the other two weren’t expected to put up any sort of a fight. The tie against Turkey this week comes exactly a year to the day of their opening qualifier against Azerbaijan – a match that gave a warning sign of the campaign ahead. Despite complete dominance from start to finish, with 29 shots overall, 14 on target and a shade over two-thirds of possession, Portugal could only muster a 1-0 home win thanks to an own goal. It was three points on the board, but the disjointed performance and lacklustre finishing in front of goal wasn’t exactly reassuring. Next up, a match that Portugal would look back on with deep regret and frustration. Fernando Santos’ men travelled to Belgrade to face qualification rivals Serbia. Portugal raced into a 2-0 lead after just 36 minutes courtesy of two goals from Liverpool man Diogo Jota – it was the perfect start against their biggest threat to qualification. Until Serbia turned the game on its head. Dragan Stojković opted to make a double change at half-time, with one of those changes seeing Nemanja Radonjić enter the fray. Over the next fifteen minutes Serbia scored twice to level the match, Radonjić assisted both goals. Then came the infamous moment in stoppage time. With the game heading for a draw, Cristiano Ronaldo brilliantly turned in a brilliant effort past the goalkeeper and looked to have given Portugal all three points, Stefan Mitrović slid in to clear the ball but only after it had clearly crossed the line. The one man in the stadium who didn’t believe it had gone in, however, was referee Danny Makkelie. With no VAR or goal-line technology in operation, the Dutch official waved play on, only realising after the match that the goal should have stood. He quickly issued an apology, but for Portugal, it was two points lost. “As per FIFA’s policies, all I can say is that I apologised to the national coach, Mr. Fernando Santos, and to the Portuguese team for what happened…As a referee team, we always work hard to make good decisions. When we are in the news in this manner, it doesn’t make us happy at all.”  “It looked like the hard part was done, but then they changed the system in the second half, scored quickly, and built on from there. But what happened cannot happen at this level.” Both Portugal and Serbia were expected to continue to pick up points against the other three sides in Group A, so quickly became obvious that their clash in Lisbon on the final matchday would be the decisive match. That would go on to be the case, with both sides picking up 13 points of a possible 15 over five matches before their crunch clash. Going into the final showdown in Lisbon, Portugal simply had to avoid defeat. It took only 95 seconds for the Portuguese to get off to a dream start, with Renato Sanches scoring their quickest goal in qualifying to put them 1-0 ahead. In hindsight, that goal didn’t help them, with Santos’ side sitting retreating further back as time progressed and inviting pressure and the inevitable. Serbia obliged and began to use the space Portugal allowed them, controlling possession and eventually forcing an equaliser half an hour later through the influential Dušan Tadić. Serbia continued to dominate and in the 90th minute, disaster struck for Portugal. Half-time substitute Aleksandar Mitrović scored a last-gasp winner to send his nation to Qatar and send Portugal into the dreaded playoffs. In truth, the damage was done across the final two matchdays in November, with Portugal’s defeat to Serbia being proceeded by a drab 0-0 draw in Dublin against the Republic of Ireland. Across those final two matches, Portugal put in their worst two attacking displays of the campaign – mustering just three shots on target in both games and having a lower expected goals total across those two games combined (1.14) than in any single match in the qualification campaign before it. Without doubt one of the biggest issues Fernando Santos has faced in recent years is finding a system to get the best out of the world-class talent at his disposal. This is where the disconnect and lack of faith in Santos from a section of supporters stems from, supporters who believe that Portugal should be trying to move away from Santos’ more pragmatic style of play and transition into a side who are fluid, attacking and free flowing. When you look through the Portugal squad, it is chock-full of players who are making big impacts at top clubs, week in, week out. Seven of Portugal’s squad for the play-offs have at least 10 goal involvements across the top five European leagues in 2021-22 so far, with one of those – Diogo Jota – in the form of his life at Liverpool, having scored 19 goals in his first season at the club: the fourth highest tally of any Premier League player across all competitions. The talented trio of Bernardo Silva, João Cancelo and Rúben Dias are three names that are almost guaranteed to be in the starting eleven each week for Manchester City as they fight for the quadruple this season. Portugal’s all-time leading scorer Cristiano Ronaldo has 18 competitive goals this season at the age of 37, while teammate Bruno Fernandes’ 13 assists beaten by only Trent Alexander-Arnold of Premier League players across all competitions in 2021-22. Then there is Nuno Mendes, Raphaël Guerreiro, Renato Sanches and João Félix among various others. These are all Champions League calibre players, yet for Portugal, Santos hasn’t been able to find a system that enables them to transition their club form into a Seleção shirt. Portugal in 2016 were disciplined, industrious and hard to beat, it was those gritty performances that brought Portugal their first senior international title. It wasn’t perfect or aesthetically pleasing at times, but it ‘got the job done’ and that triumph will be etched in the memory of every Portuguese supporter who witnessed it. However, six years after that Euro triumph, Portugal have only put in a handful of truly memorable performances: the UEFA Nations League final versus Holland being one, the 4-1 dismantling of Croatia in 2021 being another – those matches demonstrated what Portugal can be when it all clicks, a mixture of industry and dynamism, rugged but also fluid. The frequency of those type of performances, however, is what has alarmed many supporters, who believe that with such an abundance of talent to choose from, Portugal should be playing on the front foot, with no fear, regardless of the opponent and competing with the very best teams in the world. Portugal have shown on more than one occasion, that when faced with a team playing a back three or a back five, they often struggle to cope. A great example of this struggle was the 4-2 defeat against Germany at Euro 2020, where despite scoring twice, it was a nightmare performance for Portugal. They conceded four times, but it could have been much worse. Germany’s expected goals total (2.64) was the fifth highest by a team in a match within the European Championship group stages last summer, with their 12 shots having an average xG of 0.22. Much of their attacking output came via wingbacks Robin Gosens and Joshua Kimmich – their xG and xA totals combined for the match were 1.36 (Gosens) and 0.62 (Kimmich), while Gosens was able to have seven touches in the opposition box from his wingback role. In both of matches against Serbia, Stojković set his side up in a 3-5-2/3-5-1-1 with the attack minded Andrija Živković and Filip Kostić at right and left wing-back respectively. Both players were able to continually get at Portugal’s full backs, denying João Cancelo and Nuno Mendes the space or time to get out with the ball and positionally Serbia forced Cancelo especially back, stopping him from getting forward and influencing the game in an attacking sense. Even in the matches that Portugal went into as heavy favourites, such as the two games against the Republic of Ireland, they struggled against the three central defenders, especially when Matt Doherty and Séamus Coleman dropped in either side of Egan and O’Shea to form a back five and at times a back six when a central midfielder would drop in. It took a late brace from Ronaldo to spare Portugal’s blushes, scoring an 89th minute equaliser and a dramatic 96th minute winner after Portugal had spent just under half the game 1-0 down. In the return leg in Ireland, it was much of the same problems. This time, Portugal limped to a 0-0 draw, in a match that saw the possession split near enough evenly (49% – 51%), it was the perfect tactical set-up to frustrate Portugal and the most alarming thing was their inability to find a way around it. When it rains it pours. At the moment, it seems like Portugal are collecting a new injury every day. Couple that with their existing suspensions, and the starting XI for the crucial Turkey play-off meeting is not looking anything close to full strength. The latest player to drop out is veteran central defender Pepe, who has contracted Covid-19 so will be out of the Turkey game at the very least. Rúben Dias is also out through injury, meaning that Portugal will be without their starting central defence pairing. Lille captain José Fonte is likely to take a place in the starting XI, possibly alongside Danilo Pereira who is a defensive midfielder by trade but has operated at centre-back this season for PSG. One player missing via suspension will be their world-class fullback João Cancelo. You only have to look back to Portugal’s Euro 2020 performance to see how much Cancelo’s absence is felt in the national team. Usually, you’d expect his replacement to be Wolves’ Nélson Semedo, however he is also injured, meaning at right-back Santos has either Cédric Soares or Diogo Dalot to choose from. Rúben Neves, who has been in exceptional form under Bruno Lage this season, was included in the original squad but has also to withdraw due to injury, being replaced by Porto wonderkid Vitinha. Their final goalscorer in the group stage of qualifying, Renato Sanches, also misses out in this match due to injury. Fernando Santos is not likely to shake things up too much, despite that not being what supporters undoubtedly want to see. He has remained loyal to his methods throughout his tenure, and it would be a huge surprise if he was to completely change his approach in a game as important as this one is. If Portugal progress, they then face the winner of the North Macedonia versus Italy tie, meaning that at least one of the last two European Championship winners (2016 & 2020) will be missing out on the World Cup. It’s not all doom and gloom however, with Portugal having the attacking options coming into this game in brilliant form – if they get a chance in front of goal, you’d fancy them to take their chances. One ounce of comfort for Portugal fans is that their opponents Turkey had an even worse Euro 2020 than themselves, while their only meeting against opponents in the calibre of Portugal since then seeing them suffer a 6-1 defeat to Netherlands in September 2021. Portugal won’t care how they do it, but they are counting on their national side to get the job done. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our newsletter to receive exclusive content.

11364,Germany vs. Japan: Prediction and Preview,"We preview the 2022 World Cup match between Germany and Japan, including our pre-match prediction for each team’s opening game in Group E. You must allow functional cookies to continue. Germany are not used to World Cup failures and do not intend to reflect on their Russia 2018 experience as they prepare to begin their 2022 campaign against Japan. Die Mannschaft are four-time world champions and have reached at least the semi-finals at four of the five tournaments since the start of this century – more than any other nation over this period. But the exception came four years ago as Germany – then the holders – exited in the group stage, losing to Mexico and South Korea. It was the first time since 1950, when Germany were last absent from the World Cup, that they had failed to progress beyond the first round. Defender Niklas Sule’s only finals appearance to date was in that 2-0 reverse against South Korea, and it is not an experience he is particularly keen to revisit. “It doesn’t matter anymore,” he told the media. “We are in a fast-paced society where there is no time for success and failure. I also explicitly mention the successes. What happened yesterday no longer interests anyone.”  Germany have been drawn into a tough group that includes Spain and Costa Rica as well as Japan, but they rebounded impressively in qualification. After hosts Qatar, Hansi Flick’s side were the first to book their place at the finals, with only England (39) scoring more goals in the European qualifiers (36). “We have the quality to go far,” World Cup debutant Jamal Musiala added. “We go in with the mindset to win the title. We believe in it and are all eager for it to start now.” Opponents Japan have won only one of their last eight World Cup matches, although that sole victory – in their Russia opener against Colombia – was enough to take them through to the round of 16 last time out. The Samurai Blue have plenty of experience on the global stage, appearing at a seventh straight finals, although they have never advanced to the second round at consecutive editions. Thomas Muller has been Germany’s main man at recent World Cups, with his 10 goals and six assists in 16 appearances the most of any player since his finals debut in 2010. Only Miroslav Klose (16), Gerd Muller (14) and Jurgen Klinsmann (11) have more World Cup goals for them. But Muller may no longer be a guaranteed starter under Flick, with Bayern Munich team-mate Musiala the face of this younger team. The 19-year-old, who could have instead been playing for England in Qatar, is more than capable of picking up the mantle, having scored nine goals and assisted six more in the Bundesliga this season. His 15 goal involvements are the most of any teenager across Europe’s top five leagues. Minamino, like Musiala, is in line for his World Cup debut, despite being named in Japan’s preliminary squad as long ago as Brazil 2014. An underwhelming stint at Liverpool slowed the attacker’s progress at club level, and he has netted only a single goal for Monaco this season, having been limited to just 333 minutes in Ligue 1 across nine appearances. However, for Japan, Minamino was the key man in qualification, scoring 10 goals and assisting four – form he will hope to carry into the finals. This is the first meeting between Germany and Japan at a World Cup but Die Mannschaft are unbeaten across their two previous encounters in friendlies – and supercomputer’s prediction model expects them to maintain that record. In his first game as a head coach at a major tournament, Flick is given a 65.4% chance of leading Germany to victory. Japan are an outside 14.1% shot, while the draw is rated at 20.5% – a result Germany perhaps cannot afford with Spain still to play.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2022/11/germany-vs-japan-prediction-and-preview/,Ben Spratt,23/11/2022 4:22,the-analyst

10638,Why Nobody Knows Phil Foden’s Best Position,"Phil Foden is just 23 years old, and has won the Premier League five times, the FA Cup twice, the EFL Cup four times and the Champions League once. He has started a World Cup quarter-final and played in a European Championship semi-final. He has achieved a quite incredible amount already. And yet, it also feels as though his career so far has been ever so slightly underwhelming. Certainly not in terms of trophies, but maybe in that most people expected him to be a more prominent player for both club and country by now. That probably isn’t through any particular fault of his own. Aside from the time he broke Covid isolation rules when on tour with England in Iceland in September 2020, there have never really been any questions or concerns about his professionalism. His Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has even spoken publicly on several occasions about how well Foden trains. But at this stage of his career, approaching six years on from his City debut as a substitute in a Champions League group stage game against Feyenoord in November 2017, some fans might have expected more of this precocious talent. In his first season with the first team, he broke countless records, including becoming the youngest English player to start a Champions League match at 17 years and 192 days old, as well as the youngest Englishman to start a knockout match in the competition a few months later. He played in the EFL Cup final victory over Arsenal and soon after became the youngest player ever to receive a Premier League winners’ medal. A couple of weeks later, he turned 18. This hugely exciting and talented youngster was, in the eyes of many, the future of English football. “He is the most talented player I have ever seen,” Guardiola said a year later, at the end of the 2018-19 season. Some praise. At that time, when Foden was showing he could be an important player – though still largely used from the bench – for one of the best managers of all time at the most successful club of the era despite still being a teenager, it was fair to assume that at some point in the next few seasons we would see a breakout year. Foden would explode. It’s September 2023, and we’re arguably still waiting. That isn’t to say we haven’t seen plenty of Foden doing what he does best, picking apart opposition defences with wonderful deft touches, clever reverse passes and neat dribbles, but he is still not yet a consistent starter either at club or international level. And back when he was tearing it up for City aged 17, 18, 19 and 20, plenty of people reasonably expected that a 23-year-old Foden would be a key player for at least one of City and England, if not both. Part of the problem seems to be that nobody is quite clear as to his best position. His versatiliity is a useful trait, but that has meant he has been shunted around the pitch, unable to hold down a specific spot while others nail theirs down and get more game time in that position, learning exactly how Guardiola wants them to play. “Phil can play in five positions,” Guardiola said in October 2022. “I would say he can even play as a left-back. He played a few minutes there at home and he played really well.” Over the past three seasons, Foden has played a huge variety of positions for City. The turnover of personnel in midfield and attack at City could – and maybe should – have led to more opportunities for him; a key opening for him to grab. In the years since he broke into the team, the departures list at the Etihad Stadium includes Yaya Touré, David Silva, Leroy Sané, Ferran Torres, Sergio Agüero, Raheem Sterling, Gabriel Jesus, Riyad Mahrez, Ilkay Gündogan and Cole Palmer. Foden has interchanged positions with each of them at one time or another. For his City debut he replaced Touré from the bench, while he was seen by some as the ideal left-footed replacement for Silva in the left number-eight position; more recently, he played false nine ahead of Agüero and Jesus, and he shared the wide attacker positions with Sterling and Mahrez. Each departure, however, has led to further investment, and while Foden has been given plenty of chances all over the pitch, his intermittent good performances have not led to a sustained run in any particular position. On only five occasions in his career has he started five or more consecutive Premier League games for City. It’s almost as if any slight mishap or imperfect performance on his part is pounced upon by his manager as a reason to rotate him out of the team. Perhaps that’s just a reflection of the sky-high standards Guardiola holds his players to, though. What that has meant is too little game time for Foden. He has completed 90 minutes just 43 times in the Premier League for City. Last season, when Foden was City’s second-highest goalscorer in league games behind Erling Haaland, with 11 goals, 13 teammates were given more game time than him. He played just 1,844 minutes of a possible 3,420 (53.9%) in the Premier League, while on the way to Champions League glory, he played only 381 minutes of a possible 1,170. João Cancelo played almost as many minutes as Foden (378) across City’s 2022-23 Champions League campaign, and he left the club in January. This has proved a problem for Foden on the international scene, too. He is without question one of the 11 most gifted English players in the game at present and there are a lot of people who would argue – and have been arguing for a long time, probably as far back as the Euro 2020 tournament that was held in 2021 – that the team should be built around Foden. Or if not built specifically around him, that he should be one of the first names on the teamsheet in a central role. But he has never been able to hold down a regular starting spot for England, and opportunities in a central position have been even rarer for his country than they have for his club. Following the 3-1 win over Scotland this week, in which Foden started on the right flank and scored the opening goal, manager Gareth Southgate was asked whether he would entertain calls to play Foden through the middle. He gave an answer that was perhaps illustrative of a preference to defer to Guardiola on the subject. “He doesn’t [play centrally] for his club,” Southgate said. “You’d have to speak to Pep, who is the best coach in the world. He plays him from wide. Phil’s always got the freedom to drift if we play him wide.” In the Premier League in 2022-23, Foden played 88% of his minutes out wide, with 57% coming on the left flank. It is a curious tactic of Guardiola’s to play Foden on the left, because he usually plays his wingers on their ‘unnatural’ side of the pitch; inverted so they can cut inside onto their stronger foot. That has almost always been the case with Jack Grealish, Bernardo Silva, Mahrez, Sterling and Sané over the years, though right-footed Jesus did have a spell playing on the right flank. Playing on your natural side makes it very difficult to come infield, particularly for a player like Foden, who is very one-footed. His touch map from Premier League games last season how much he was stuck out wide and how many of his touches came very close to the touchline. Even when he played on the right, though, Guardiola still wanted him to receive very wide and make the pitch as big as possible, leaving space centrally for the number eights to get into, and pulling the opposition’s defence apart to give Haaland as much space as possible to get into shooting positions. That meant that Foden had most of his touches in wide positions whichever flank he was playing on. His numbers are impressive wherever he plays, though. Since his Premier League debut in December 2017, 207 players have got more minutes on the pitch than him (7,128), but he ranks 31st for combined goals and assists (56). Only 10 players with a minimum of 5,000 minutes played have directly contributed to a goal more often than him (every 127 minutes). Remember this includes the period when Foden had only just broken through at City; every other player above him in the list is far more experienced – including players like Agüero, Kevin De Bruyne, Mohamed Salah and Harry Kane. He has also scored his 35 Premier League goals from just 26.3 xG, with only eight players boasting a better overperformance in front of goal than his 8.7, showing just how good his finishing is. It is hard not to wonder what damage he could cause if he spent less time such a long way away from goal. It therefore makes sense that fans want to see a player this talented play centrally. He is exceptional – arguably unmatched among English players – when it comes to unlocking an opposition defence, and the prospect of him combining with Jude Bellingham behind Kane at next summer’s Euros is an incredibly exciting one. After the win over Scotland, Foden was asked about his best position. “I see myself as a threat on the wings and also coming inside,” he said. “Today I was a right winger, but I got to drift inside a little more into the central areas, and I enjoyed that role today. Hopefully I can start playing there more in the future.” As Southgate suggested, those chances will have to come at club level if Foden is to then play centrally for his country. Guardiola has hinted recently that those opportunities might not be too far off. “He has something special in that [central] position,” the City manager said before the start of this season. “The quality of the one-against-one, arriving in the box, the sense of goal. With Gündogan leaving maybe he can play more in that position, we will see.” Now, with De Bruyne out with a long-term injury, there should – in theory at least – be two positions up for grabs in central midfield. However, in all four of City’s games since De Bruyne suffered a recurrence of a hamstring injury against Burnley, the midfield three has been made up of Rodri, Mateo Kovacic (another new signing) and Julián Álvarez. Foden has started three of those four games – out wide each time – putting in a man-of-the-match performance in the win against Newcastle. That day, he started on the right but had more freedom to move all around the pitch, as his touch map shows. He clearly wants to be able to get into central positions, and that becomes easier to do when he is playing on the right than when he is the left. It also makes him more difficult to track as he has to move between zones on the pitch to receive centrally. But given how good he is at receiving in tight spaces on the half-turn, he – and many fans – will probably be hoping that he does get a chance to the left of Rodri in central midfield. It could be that Guardiola doesn’t think Foden is capable of doing the very specific job that he wants his number eights to do, and that could have something to do with the out-of-possession role they play. The defensive side of the game doesn’t come naturally to Foden, while any extra defensive responsibilities will of course take something else away from his in-possession game. It could be that Guardiola is trying to protect Foden from those responsibilities. Or it could simply be that the City manager still doesn’t know Foden’s best position. It’s not clear that anyone does. Even Foden. After the group stage at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the City midfielder was asked about where he’d like to play. “I don’t even know! Everywhere,” he replied. “I feel like I’m a 10, whether it’s now or in the future, behind the striker, getting on the ball and trying to make things happen. I’m playing more out wide and I can do that job as well. At the same time, I do like playing wide because you score more goals and get in the box a lot more.” Crystal clear, that. Everyone, including Foden himself it seems, is still trying to work out where he should play. Now in his seventh season, chasing his sixth Premier League crown, it’s time that he does enough to hold down a regular spot for City and make a starting berth in England’s team at Euro 2024 his own. Where on the pitch that should be is still very much up in the air. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new football newsletter to receive exclusive weekly content.

9281,"Barcelona set asking price for Frenkie de Jong, it's not £100m","According to Mundo Deportivo, a reliable Spanish source, Barcelona will demand £85 million to let Frenkie de Jong leave this summer. De Jong rejected Manchester United in 2022 to fight for his place at Camp Nou. At the time, they bid £70 million to sign him but Barca were demanding close to £100 million to let him go. Fast forward to now and Barca have had a season to forget with manager Xavi announcing he will step down at the end of 2023/24. The midfielder's contract expires in 2026 but talks over a new one with Barcelona have not gone as per plan. Due to financial insecurity, Barca are reportedly insistent on De Jong reducing his wages. He's now the highest earner at the club, pocketing an estimated £231,000 per week.Negotiations have stalled, with De Jong likely to seek a move elsewhere as Barcelona plunge further into turmoil. If Man United wish to sign De Jong, matching Barca's price tag may just be easier than settling on a wage plan with the Dutchman.

10080,Jordan vs South Korea Prediction and Preview,"We’ve reached the semi-final stage of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup. We look ahead to the match at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium in Al Rayyan with our Jordan vs South Korea prediction and preview. Jordan’s journey to the Asian Cup semi-finals has been marked by some impressive performances. In the group stage, they showcased their prowess with a commanding 4-0 victory against Malaysia and a hard-fought 2-2 draw against South Korea. A 1-0 triumph over Bahrain in their final group match solidified their place in the knockout stage. Their last-16 clash was arguably one of the most dramatic seen at the tournament so far as they won 3-2 against Iraq in normal time, despite trailing as late as the 94th minute. With Iraq down to 10 men, Jordan capitalised with an equaliser from Yazan Al-Arab in the 95th minute and a winner two minutes later from Nizar Al-Rashdan. Less drama was on display in their quarter-final as they squeezed past Tajikistan by a single goal – an own goal in the 66th minute by Vahdat Hanonov – to reach the AFC Asian Cup semis for the first time ever. Drawing inspiration from their earlier 2-2 deadlock against South Korea in the group stage, Jordan can enter the semi-final with confidence they can match it against a familiar foe. However, the absence of striker Ali Olwan and defender Salem Al-Ajalin due to suspension adds an extra challenge at both ends of the pitch.  With Olwan Jordan’s leading player for successful take-ons in the final third (12), much of the attacking threat will be placed on the shoulders of Mousa Tamari out on the right wing. Al-Ajalin, whose been deployed in every match at the tournament in the left centre-back role, will be missed within the backline as a great option to build attacks on the left side, where he’s consistently linked up with winger Mahmoud Al Mardi. South Korea’s journey to the semis has been characterised by resilience and heroics late on in matches. They started the tournament well with a 3-1 win over Bahrain, before two draws against Jordan (2-2) and Malaysia (3-3) saw them finish second in Group E. Despite this, they did finish the group stage with eight goals – a tally no other side could do better than. Finishing second in the group handed them a tricky last-16 tie with Saudi Arabia, where they looked to be heading out until Cho Gue-sung’s equaliser in the 99th minute. They held out in extra time, before dispatching of the Saudis 4-2 in a penalty shootout to set up a quarter-final meeting with Australia. They again did it the hard way as they advanced past the Socceroos, conceding first and only equalising deep into added time at the end of the match via a Hwang Hee-chan penalty. It was Son Heung-min who ended as the hero on this occasion, with his exceptional free kick in extra time sending South Korea into the semis. With South Korea already being taken to extra time twice in this tournament, they could do without the same again. Tottenham forward Son has played every single minute of their campaign so far, being on the pitch for 601 minutes, including all added time across their five matches – the most by a player at this tournament. His three goals are level-best for South Korea at this tournament alongside Lee Kang-in, with the 22-year-old Paris Saint-Germain star the leading chance creator at the Asian Cup so far (17). Jürgen Klinsmann will have to do without talismanic centre-back Kim Min-jae for this game, however. The Bayern Munich defender is suspended, with Son’s leadership even more important with such a senior figure of the squad out of action for this crucial tie. Their AFC Asian Cup 2023 group stage meeting was the first international between South Korea and Jordan in nearly 10 years, after previously playing a friendly match in November 2014. The group stage game between these two nations ended 2-2, with Son opening the scoring from a ninth-minute penalty kick. Jordan took a shock 2-1 lead into half-time, however, following an own goal via Park Yong-woo and a first-half injury time strike from forward Yazan Al-Naimat. They nearly hung on for a crucial victory, but South Korea forced an added time equaliser via an Yazan Al-Arab own goal.  A point was more than deserved for South Korea based on the match stats, with them attempting nearly twice as many shots as Jordan (23 vs 12) and posting a much higher expected goals (xG) total overall (2.15 vs 0.27). South Korea are the favourites to progress to the AFC Asian Cup 2023 final in this tie with the Opta supercomputer. The Taegeuk Warriors won 55.9% of the 10,000 pre-match simulations inside 90 minutes – something South Korea would surely be happy with having to go through extra time in each of the last two rounds. Jordan won just over one-in-five of the simulations ahead of kick-off (21.7%) and are the tournament outsiders among the four teams left at this Asian Cup in Qatar.

3234,2022 World Cup Qualifiers: Senegal's Koulibaly ready to avenge 2019 Algeria defeat at Cairo Stadium,"Senegal captain Kalidou Koulibaly has revealed they will be aiming at avenging the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations defeat by Algeria at the Cairo International Stadium when they play Egypt on Friday. The Lions of Teranga will be at the venue they played at three years ago, but this time around it will be against the Pharaohs and in the first leg of the 2022 World Cup play-offs. The Napoli centre-back has explained how it felt missing the final three years ago, owing to suspension, and making a return to the stadium. ""[2019 Afcon final] was a very difficult match. I watched it from the stands, and when I entered the stadium, I remembered that match,"" Koulibaly said in a presser as quoted by Kingfut. ""Everyone knows that and gives us more of a push, which encourages us to take our revenge and win on the field despite everything. We will give our best to overcome this pressure. ""We are ready for the match, especially since we have met Egypt since the final of the Africa Cup of Nations, which makes the match more difficult. We are now more prepared since a lot of time has passed."" Koulibaly will be playing against the in-form Liverpool attacker Mohamed Salah. It will not be the first time they have played against each other and the Teranga Lion has stated their main focus will be on all Egypt players and not the 29-year-old. ""I played a lot against Salah since he was in Rome. For me, Salah and [Sadio] Mane are the main strengths for both teams,"" the Senegal captain continued. ""We will not focus on Salah only, but we will focus on all the players. We will make sure not to concede any goals and try to take advantage of opportunities to score."" After meeting on Friday, the two nations will again face each other in the second leg on Tuesday in Dakar with the aggregate winner making it to the World Cup.

7292,'I was a bit rattled!' - Mavropanos opens up on Arsenal move & why he rates Lukaku so highly ,"Konstantinos Mavropanos admits he was left “a bit rattled” when learning that Arsenal wanted to sign him in the January transfer window of 2018, with the Greek defender going on to be handed a baptism of fire on his Premier League debut away at Manchester United. That contest pitted a promising centre-half into direct competition with Romelu Lukaku, and the 24-year-old claims he has not faced a more formidable attacking foe since. A steep learning curve currently has Mavropanos spending a second season on loan at Bundesliga side Stuttgart, with questions being asked of his long-term future at Emirates Stadium, but a confident character is delighted at having fulfilled a professional dream. Mavropanos has told GOAL and SPOX of being snapped up by Arsenal from PAS Giannia in his homeland: “Oh man, that was a crazy day. I remember it very well. “I had a very good six months in Greece for my club PAS Ioannina and on New Year's Eve I got the call that Arsenal wanted to sign me. On 31 December I got the call and on 1 January I was already on my way to London to sign my contract. “I was so nervous during those days. Suddenly such a big club like Arsenal wants you, I was a bit rattled.” A man with eight appearances for the Gunners to his name added on his experiences in England: “It was an adventure for me. “It was my first time away from my home country of Greece and then at such a big club in a cosmopolitan city like London. It was a big difference. “Suddenly you're sitting in the dressing room next to stars like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who you only knew from television before. “When Sokratis came to Arsenal for the new season, it was worth its weight in gold for me. He was a mentor for me and helped me a lot off the pitch, but also in terms of reading the game from the defence, for example.” Mavropanos was eased into the Arsenal fold with outings for the club’s U23 side, but was suddenly thrown in at the deep end when asked to face Manchester United at Old Trafford in April 2018. The Gunners suffered a 2-1 defeat that day, but the occasion will always hold fond memories for a man making his English top-flight bow. “I'll never forget my debut,” Mavropanos said. “It was at Old Trafford against Man United and I was up against Romelu Lukaku. To this day, I haven't had to play against a better striker. “We played Bayern and Dortmund in the Bundesliga with VfB but I never had the personal matchup with Robert Lewandowski or Erling Haaland. That's why I have to say that Lukaku has been my toughest opponent so far. His physique is very impressive, and he's so good technically that he's really very difficult to stop.” Arsenal tied Mavropanos to a new contract when sanctioning the first of his loan moves to Stuttgart in the summer of 2020, but his current club are reportedly keen on pushing a permanent transfer through if they are able to avoid slipping through a relegation trapdoor in the Bundesliga.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bit-rattled-mavropanos-arsenal-move-rates-lukaku-highly/blt120b15213fa50eac,Florian Regelmann,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1084,'He doesn't know who I am!' - Man Utd's Fernandes hits back at Agbonlahor criticism & reveals Mata's message of support,"Bruno Fernandes has hit back at criticism from former Aston Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor, who singled him out following Manchester United's 4-0 defeat at Brentford last weekend. After the humiliating performance, Agbonlahor suggested that the Portuguese midfielder ""gets away with murder"" and described him as a bad team-mate. Fernandes has now issued a response, while also revealing that he has received a message of support from ex-Red Devils colleague Juan Mata. Fernandes told ELEVEN when quizzed on Agbonlahor's remarks: ""It’s honestly not something that worries me too much. He’s never played with me, he doesn’t know how I am."" The 27-year-old added on Mata's kind words: “Just yesterday I told my wife, who spoke to me about this interview and I said, ‘You know what calms me down?’  ""Just two days ago a person called Juan Mata, world champion, European champion, winner of the Champions League, all in England, said to me, ‘You were the best people I’ve met in football, continue like that, being yourself, with that honesty, this ability to work’.  “If someone says that… you know how I am. Boring, because I demand it, but because I am demanding with myself and I also demand it from others.” Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was also baffled by Agbonlahor's outburst on talkSPORT as he appeared to defend Fernandes and United ahead of his team's huge trip to Old Trafford in the Premier League on Monday. The German coach said that he didn't remember the former England international being a ""mentality monster"" as the last time he played against Liverpool, Villa lost 6-0. He added: ""I was close to calling in! I was close to calling in to tell him ‘you have forgot completely that you have been a player’. ""It was unbelievable and if ex-players are already like this, you can imagine how everything else is going. Now you just have to ask yourself ‘how would you want to react in a situation like this?’ And you would, of course, fight back. That’s completely normal, that’s what we expect.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-fernandes-hits-back-agbonlahor-criticism-mata/blt5a0464d5e233100a,Ritabrata Banerjee,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
9903,Sir Dave Brailsford already 'unimpressed' with one thing at Man United,"According to the Daily Mail, Sir Dave Brailsford intends to monitor Manchester United's daily operations till the Premier League ratifies INEOS investment. As an advisor to Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Brailsford has been observing how the club do things both on and off the field. He's reportedly unimpressed with how Man United are overstaffed in all areas and yet most of them lack the expertise needed to run a club of this stature. The Glazers are notorious for running operations remotely, delegating most of the important tasks to senior officials. And the Daily Mail understands there is no proper authority to take the tough decisions. One example cited by the Daily Mail is it's not been uncommon for more than one scout to show up at the same game for Man United. The entire process needs streamlining to run more effectively.

10505,Liverpool Already Seeing Results From Their Midfield Rebuild,"It was a busy summer for Liverpool, especially when it came to signing midfielders. We take a look at how the renovated area is performing in the early months of the season. Liverpool made the bold decision to completely overhaul their midfield this summer.  A rebuild was always on the cards but few envisioned five outgoings – of which the captain and the vice-captain were included – and four incomings. Liverpool swapped out Jordan Henderson, Fabinho, Naby Keïta, James Milner and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai, Wataru Endo and Ryan Gravenberch.  Such drastic changes could have gone one of two ways. It was either going to be a huge success with key players seamlessly adapting to life at Anfield, or it would be another transitional campaign for the 2019-20 Premier League champions.  It is perhaps too early to confidently declare the summer transfer window a successful one for Liverpool, but Jürgen Klopp’s men have arguably been one of the surprise packages of the 2023-24 campaign to date, having taken 17 points from their opening eight Premier League matches. It is an even more impressive haul when you consider five of these games have been away from Anfield and they have already faced Chelsea, Newcastle United, Tottenham and Brighton on their travels. The numbers back up this positive start to the season. Liverpool have an expected goals (xG) total of 16.9, the second highest in the Premier League behind Newcastle (17.5), and are ranked fourth for big chances created with 20 (a big chance is defined as one from which the attacking player would usually be expected to score). It would be interesting to see what these numbers could have been had they not been down to a minimum of 10 men in three of their eight matches. Whereas last season the midfield was an area of weakness, this time around the midfield department has been a clear strength, with two summer signings in particular catching the eye.  Szoboszlai has been a revelation following his £60 million summer move from RB Leipzig. The 22-year-old looks to be the natural heir to Steven Gerrard as a whirlwind midfielder who can do it all. Liverpool’s new number 8 has the technical ability to go along with his physicality, a rare blend in the modern game. He was deployed in wide areas in the Bundesliga, with almost 50% of his minutes during the 2021-22 campaign coming as a wide forward, while that figure was up to 87% last season (77% on the right and 10% on the left). The Hungary captain had barely featured in central midfield at club level and now he’s running things from that role at the top end of the Premier League. Those who spent time watching him in Austria (with Salzburg) and Germany will have already known about his quality in possession, but it is what he’s been doing without the ball that has really made him stand out so far in England. Szoboszlai never stops running and puts the needs of the team first. He’s even filled in as part of a double-pivot in some matches, sacrificing the offensive side of his game. The versatile midfielder has completely bought into the Liverpool project. He’s already altered his game to fit into Klopp’s system and isn’t just a cog in the machine.  Szoboszlai is a key part of what makes this midfield unit work. He leads the way for Liverpool’s attacking sequence involvements in the Premier League with 52, and also tops this particular chart when looking at it on a per-90 basis, with an average of 6.5. Only three players in this Liverpool team are involved in six attacking sequences or more per 90 – Szoboszlai, Darwin Núñez (6.4) and Mohamed Salah (6.0). It is even more impressive when you realise just how much he has reigned it in following his move to Merseyside. Szoboszlai is attempting fewer shots and his xG per 90 has dropped from 0.20 to 0.07. His expected assist (xA) average has also fallen from 0.3 to 0.2 this season, and if you combine his shots and chances created per 90, that’s fallen by 0.8 this season. He’s filling the role that belonged to Henderson for many years. Szoboszlai is averaging a similar number of touches to the former Liverpool skipper but he’s doing more with them. He is attempting fewer passes per 90 (58 to Henderson’s 67) but has a higher success rate (87% to 85%). The 6-foot-2 midfield powerhouse also comes out on top when looking at attempted dribbles, shots, tackles and chances created. His xA per 90 of 0.20 is higher than Henderson’s previous average of 0.14 and Szoboszlai’s average of four shots plus chances created per 90 is almost double that of the England international’s 2.3.  Szoboszlai has managed to transform the right-sided centre-midfield role at Anfield without completely impacting the dynamic of the team. Sometimes a player comes in and needs a greater number of touches and it skews the balance. It allows them to look good as an individual but the team suffers. That isn’t the case in this scenario.  He’s formed a good understanding with Mac Allister, another summer addition. The former Brighton midfielder arrived in a deal believed to be worth in the region of £35m. Despite signing Endo from Stuttgart, their new number 10 has so far been the main man anchoring the midfield.  At a glance, this might appear to be a bit of a waste of the Argentinian maestro. But the deeper role in this midfield unit actually gives Mac Allister the opportunity to see more of the ball in central areas.  Though Livepool are famed for their ‘heavy metal’ approach under Klopp, over recent years he’s looked to have his team control the space and the possession with their use of the ball.  The German tactician has wanted players in his team in key zones who can help retain possession, and Mac Allister falls into this category. The 24-year-old is actually playing more passes than ever before (65 per 90) and his pass completion is higher than it was for Brighton, with 89% of his attempts finding a teammate. The 19-cap international is also playing more progressive passes this season (5.88 up from 5.42). He’s another who has adapted his game to fit into this Liverpool team and though some believe he’s being shoehorned into a role, he’s actually being allowed to play his natural game. He is almost a blend between Thiago Alcântara and Fabinho. Believe it or not, Mac Allister is winning possession back this season more times than the Brazilian did for Liverpool last term. He’s doing the dirty work out of possession and then he’s almost flawless in possession. The World Cup winner gives his team a solid platform and a rigid base to build and sustain attacks. For the most part, the two new arrivals have been partnered with Curtis Jones in midfield. The 22-year-old found his way back into Klopp’s starting XI in April and he’s been there ever since, having impressed in the hybrid left-sided midfield role. Jones starts in the midfield three but can be found filling in as part of the back three when Liverpool are building out from the back and then as a left-winger when Luis Díaz drifts inside. He’s a counterweight and a facilitator. Jones will look to recycle and retain possession, regularly completing over 93% of his passes, so that others are able to get on the ball and do their thing. Given he started life as a wide forward, he’s comfortable in wide areas and this gives Liverpool tactical flexibility in-game if they want to change the shape of their attack. Many felt that, when fit, Thiago might reclaim his old role on the left side of a midfield three. But the role he bossed during the 2021-22 quadruple-chasing season no longer exists. He was deployed there last year too and would regularly form a double pivot with the deepest midfielder, allowing him to pull the strings in the middle of the pitch. However, Liverpool’s new inverted full-back system gives the right-back the freedom that was previously afforded to Thiago. If he were to return to the starting XI, he would likely be battling it out with Mac Allister to be the team’s deep-lying-playmaker-cum-defensive-midfielder. He doesn’t have the physical capacity to do what Jones is doing and having someone as good as him on the ball in wider areas, the ones taken up by Jones, would be a waste.  The rebuild this summer wasn’t just to replace outgoing midfielders. It was also to help Liverpool move on from those who couldn’t be relied upon and, unfortunately, Thiago fell into that category.  Gravenberch looks likely to rival Jones for minutes on the left and he’s started his Liverpool career well with two assists and a goal in three starts. When the Premier League halts for another international break in November, we’ll likely know more about the Dutchman’s role in this team, especially with Jones still suspended for two matches following his red card at Tottenham.  Endo remains the only real question mark from this summer’s business. The 30-year-old didn’t fit the usual criteria for a Liverpool signing but Klopp wanted supporters to give the former Stuttgart captain a chance. He’s not really been given a chance in the first-team yet though, at least not in the Premier League, so it is too early to judge. As of right now, the £16m signing appears to be a decent midfielder for cup competitions and that isn’t necessarily a negative. The squad needed depth after a number of options left this summer so Endo certainly filled a void. There might be more to it but, for now, that appears to be the Japan international’s role.  As far as rebuilds go though, as of right now, it has been a success for Liverpool. As of right now, they’re our second favourites to win the league this season. And there’s still more to come from all four of those new signings.  What do you make of Liverpool’s midfield rebuild?

2321,Bournemouth secure Premier League promotion with win over Nottingham Forest,"Bournemouth have secured promotion to the Premier League on Tuesday with a 1-0 victory over Nottingham Forest that ensures they will finish in second place in the Championship. An 83rd-minute strike from Kieffer Moore sealed the win which has put the Cherries at 85 points for the season. Scott Parker's side are now in the top-flight for the first time since 2019-20. “It's not sunk in yet, it’s unbelievable,"" midfielder Philip Billing told Sky Sports. “After last season it [play-offs] was something none of us wanted to do, we’ve worked hard all season, and it’s a great emotion because we put so much work in throughout the whole year. We’re a fit team and what we’ve shown with this young team is amazing.” Goalscorer Moore added: “I’m speechless, when I came here I had one goal and then had the setback straight away, but I had the dream and thankfully it’s come about. “As soon as I had my surgery my first thought was when can I get back and I want to thank the staff for helping me. “I’m glad it’s behind me and it’s hard to put into words what it means. I’ve dreamt of this moment as a kid [playing in the Premier League] and thankfully I get to live it.” Hey, @premierleague 👋 The club finished sixth last year in their return to the second-tier but have elevated their play in Parker's debut season at the helm. Former Liverpool forward Dominic Solanke has led the Cherries with 29 goals, while Billing has added 18 goal involvements. Bournemouth will finish in second place this term behind Parker's former side, Fulham. Their previous run in the Premier League lasted five years and included a ninth-place finish in 2016-17.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bournemouth-secure-premier-league-promotion-with-win-over/blt3729d6edcbb1bdd8,Dan Bernstein,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1835,"Pozuelo to Miami, Bernardeschi to Toronto: Breaking down MLS' latest blockbuster trade","One of MLS' top playmakers is on the move, opening the door for one of the league's most ambitious clubs to pull off yet another game-changing signing. Toronto FC have traded former MLS MVP Alejandro Pozuelo to Inter Miami for $150,000 (£125,000), giving the Floridian club the superstar No.10 they've been needing for some time. And, while that fee may be cheap, it does get Pozuelo off TFC's books as they now reportedly look to bring in yet another Italy international to add to their attack. It's not often you can get a former MLS MVP for pennies on the dollar, and that's what makes the acquisition of Pozeulo absolutely massive for a team like Miami. At a cost of just $150,000 GAM, the decision was a no-brainer for David Beckham's club, who have been lacking a true, veteran No.10 and now have one of the best MLS has to offer. A two-time MLS All-Star and the 2020 MLS MVP, Pozuelo has been one of the league's best playmakers since joining Toronto FC from Genk in 2019. Official 🇪🇸✍🏽Welcome, Alejandro Pozuelo#InterMiamiCF welcomes Spanish attacking midfielder and 2020 MLS MVP @Pozuelo_10 from Toronto FC, in return for General Allocation Money. https://t.co/PiXc0CyVJh There are some caveats, though. The Spaniard struggled with injuries in 2021 and hasn't played up to his own lofty standards over the last 18 months or so. Much of that can be attributed to TFC's setup in general, as the club has been, at best, treading water in a system that didn't fit Pozuelo's strengths. So, with that in mind, there's plenty of reason to believe Pozuelo could be a key player for years to come at just 30 years old. Miami now have a No.10 to slot behind Leonardo Campana, a player that has been a revelation since joining on loan from Wolves. Making things all the better is Pozeulo's familiarity with the league, meaning he'll need little time to adjust to all of the nonsense MLS has to offer. With the club still very much in the playoff chase, it could be the acquisition of Pozuelo that pushes Miami over the hump and moves them a little bit closer to where they want to be. As we determined earlier, it's not often an MLS MVP is moved for pennies on the dollar. And it certainly isn't often you can look at a move like that and go 'Okay, I see what you're doing there.' But that's exactly what this move is for Toronto, who are losing one key player to bring in one that could be even better. The loss of Pozuelo is an unfortunate one, but one they can stomach. The Spaniard was nearing the end of his contract and didn't look to be a natural fit for the club's tactical plans going forward. We already know Lorenzo Insigne is on his way and will likely occupy a spot on the left wing. It has also been heavily reported that the DP spot freed up by trading Pozuelo will be used to try to lure Juventus winger Federico Bernardeschi to take up a spot on the right. Bernardeschi hasn't quite become a star at Juventus, but he should be one hell of an attacking piece in MLS, especially with Insigne on the other side. With Insigne and Bernardeschi, TFC have two forwards that should create plenty of goals, making Pozuelo expendable. Losing Pozuelo creates an easy switch to a 4-3-3, offering TFC a bit more midfield balance behind their attacking stars. And they may not be done, either, as it appears DP Carlos Salcedo may be shipped out soon as well, freeing up even more space to be creative. By trading Pozuelo, Toronto FC have accelerated their rebuild by paving the way to sign a Euro 2020 winner to go with the one they already have, giving the club a chance to be one of the most exciting attacking teams in MLS. They'll need that to happen quickly, though, as TFC sit well outside the playoff race as we enter the dog days of summer. Right now, hard to say. We know Miami will be a winner here, even if Pozuelo does turn out to be a short-term rental. You don't get No. 10s of Pozuelo's caliber for that cheap, and you often don't get to fill needs with a puzzle piece that fits as perfectly as the Spanish midfielder. As for Toronto, much will depend on when and if Bernardeschi comes in. That deal is a home run, if they can get it over the line, but that's always a big if. If Pozuelo fits like he should at Miami and if Toronto can use their newfound roster freedom to bring in a player like Bernardeschi, this is one of those moves that will be a win-win for all involved.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/pozuelo-miami-bernardeschi-toronto-mls-blockbuster-trade/blt16459ac9f152b339,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7357,Saved by Sanchez: Sluggish Liverpool make it through but must improve to win Champions League,"Match statistics: Liverpool 0-1 Inter Alexis Sanchez could barely look. He knew. He had just done the one thing Inter needed him not to do, and as the Chile international departed down the Anfield tunnel, sent off for a second bookable offence, with him went his side’s chances of a dramatic Champions League comeback. And so it is Liverpool who head to the quarter-finals, although their passage was a lot less straightforward than most had expected following their first-leg win in Italy three weeks ago. They wobbled at times here, certainly when Lautaro Martinez gave Inter the lead just after the hour mark. It was some goal from the Argentina striker, and at that point Simone Inzaghi’s side needed just one more to force an unlikely period of extra time. Within 90 seconds, though, their hopes had been squashed. Sanchez had been fortunate to escape a red card in the first half when standing on the calf of Thiago Alcantara, but his luck would run out here as, after a heavy touch, the former Arsenal and Manchester United forward followed through on Fabinho. Referee Mateu Lahoz got plenty wrong on the night, for both sides, but he was right to brandish a second yellow. Inter lost a member of their coaching staff in the melee which followed, while Sanchez took an age to leave the field. Yep, he knew alright. With 10 men, Inter’s threat waned and Liverpool, a touch nervously, were able to see out the remainder of the game. Indeed, had Mohamed Salah’s luck been in, or had Arturo Vidal not made a miraculous goal-saving challenge on Luis Diaz, the Reds would have made themselves comfortable. As it is, they suffered only their third defeat of the campaign, undone by an Inter side that played with confidence, belief and no little quality. Inzaghi felt hard done by after the first leg, and he was left counting the cost of that 2-0 defeat at the final whistle here. Liverpool had chances of their own, mind. They hit the woodwork three times, twice through Salah and once through Joel Matip, and for all Inter’s energy and enterprise, it is worth pointing out that they managed only six shots, and that their goal was a once-in-a-lifetime hit from Lautaro. WOOOOW! 😱Lautaro Martínez with an incredible strike for Inter! 🚀#UCL pic.twitter.com/i550cMNY5T LAUTARO. GOLAZO. GAME ON. 🚀 pic.twitter.com/zVsKg1ZcFl Still, Jurgen Klopp will know his side can play better, much better. They started both halves sloppily, and were most definitely ruffled by the aggression and intensity of Inter’s pressing at times. Sanchez, until his dismissal, and Vidal were the chief menaces. Klopp had opted to spring a couple of surprises with his team, bringing Thiago straight back in after the hamstring injury which had kept him out of the last three games, and handing Curtis Jones a start too. Matip came back into defence and Diogo Jota returned up front, with Ibrahima Konatae missing and Diaz benched. Liverpool, knowing they could afford to lose and still progress, were not themselves. They did not pass the ball crisply and were caught out in the centre of the field too often. Fabinho struggled, and none of their forward players, Jota, Salah and Sadio Mane, carried the threat we are used to. Inter pushed, delighting their fans packed into the Anfield Road end, and when Lautaro struck they had a chance. Sanchez, though, had other ideas. Glory in defeat for the Serie A champions, while Liverpool can get ready for the last eight, knowing they will need to do a bit better than this when they get there. ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/saved-sanchez-sluggish-liverpool-through-improve-win/bltd24e908e62312f19,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5536,"Robbed, attacked and threatened by armed police: The Liverpool fans engulfed in a Champions League final 'nightmare'","For most of Saturday, it had looked and felt like a dream European trip. The sun was shining, spirits were high and Paris was a sea of red. Liverpool fans were preparing to watch their team in another Champions League final, and the mood was one of celebration, hope and optimism. “A big, Scouse party, with everyone having the time of their life,” as one supporter puts it. By the end of the night, however, everything had changed. For thousands of Liverpudlians, the dream became a nightmare. “It was the worst experience I’ve ever had at a football match,” Paul Machin, of The Redmen TV channel, tells GOAL. “I’ve been going to games since I was six years old, and it was unlike anything I’ve ever witnessed.” His sentiments will be echoed by scores of fellow supporters, some of whom were subjected to tear gas and pepper spray attacks by French police outside the Stade de France, and in the designated ‘fan meeting zone’ at Cours de Vincennes. Others found themselves under attack from gangs of local youths. At least one fan had his face slashed, while another suffered a suspected broken leg in a street attack. Many others required hospital treatment, and even more were shaken to the point that they will seriously consider whether to follow their team abroad again in the future. Post-match last night was the scariest I’ve ever experienced. Organised gangs set about mugging departing fans. We ran a gauntlet of thuggery on our way to the Metro. Not a police officer in sight. Witnessed so many ambush attacks on unsuspecting attendees. Reprehensible @UEFA After the game - which finished 1-0 to Real Madrid, as if it really matters - Machin witnessed, close-up, the heavy-handed treatment of fans by police en route to Saint-Denis Porte de Paris train stations. He saw armed officers pointing guns at terrified supporters, while others ran for safety. “It was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life,” he says. “To be so close to something like that, I don’t have the words to describe it. “Can you imagine walking away from a concert, or any other big event, and having a gun pointed at you? It’s insane.” Another fan, who asked not to be named, tells GOAL: “This was my seventh European final watching Liverpool, and it will probably be my last. I don’t ever want to go through something like that again.” The problems started as soon as supporters disembarked at the Stade de France metro station. From there, they looked to make the short trip up to the stadium, which on a normal day would take 15-20 minutes, only to discover huge queues as, with minimal ticket checks and little to no signposting, fans found themselves penned in as they made their way over, or under, the busy A1 highway. “It was a nightmare,” says a fan who spent more than two hours in the queues, which were made worse by the presence of police vans, parked diagonally across the street beneath a bridge.  “There were no checks until you reached the bottom of this ramp which leads up to the stadium, and even then there were maybe six stewards - not police - looking after thousands of fans. They were barely checking tickets, just dabbing them with a pen, a bit of a search and that was it."" The situation was no better at the turnstiles. When fans, most of whom had been shoved through a dark, narrow underpass and had encountered local pickpockets who worked their way through the slow-moving queues, finally arrived at the ground, they found a series of closed gates, with police and stewards uninterested in their concerns. “I was in section Y,” says one fan, a season-ticket holder who arrived at the metro station at 6.30pm local time, two-and-a-half hours before kick off. “There were people queuing, four deep, for as far as the eye could see. “Those on the inside were trapped against the gates, nobody was moving, and nobody on the other side of the gate was communicating at all. They were treated like cattle.” With scores of supporters, including children, disabled fans and elderly match-goers, stuck in the queues outside,  many of them in distress and fearing for their safety, UEFA took the decision to delay the kick-off. The news arrived 14 minutes before the scheduled start time, but was not communicated to those still waiting outside - a move which would have at least alleviated some of the tension that had built up over the previous two hours or more. Inside the stadium, a message on the big screens relayed the news. The delay, it said, was due to “the late arrival of fans”, prompting boos and whistles from supporters. It was an outright lie, a disgusting and blatant attempt by UEFA at shifting the blame. Liverpool fans have seen that game before, of course, and as more and more stories emerged from outside the ground, it became clear that UEFA’s narrative should not, and must not, be accepted. Disgraceful. The game feels unimportant right now, to be perfectly honest. https://t.co/ovkAy5K6zA Of course some are desperate to accept it. Within minutes, videos were circulating on social media showing Liverpool fans climbing over a wall, apparently to illegally gain entry to the stadium. Shamefully, several accounts with large followings shared the videos, thus repeating the lie that here we had Liverpool supporters, misbehaving again. The truth is that those fans were not ‘bunking in’ but climbing to safety, having been caught in the crush on the ramp leading up to the stadium. On the other side of that wall was not the Stade de France itself, but more barriers, more gates and more police. On the concourse inside the ground, a journalist, who had travelled as a fan, approached what he described as “a very worried-looking UEFA official”, asking for an explanation. “He told me the reason they’d said that on the big screen was to prevent panic inside the stadium,” he told GOAL. Meanwhile, those trapped outside were about to be subjected to a horrific attack at the hands of the police. “It was like something out of a war film,” says one fan, a veteran of more than 30 years and a good friend of this correspondent. “All of a sudden, out of nowhere, people start dropping to the floor, grabbing their faces. My eyes started stinging and streaming, and that’s when you realise ‘f*cking hell, they’re gassing us! “There were kids in there, families, older fans. They had tickets and were trying to get inside to see their team play a final, and they’re being tear-gassed by the police. F*cking incredible.” By this point a number of journalists had made their way outside from the press box to capture the scenes. ESPN reporter Mark Ogden filmed a police officer pepper-spraying a fan, while Carrie Brown, of BeIn Sports, spoke to fans who had made their way inside once the gates were belatedly opened. Steve Douglas, a reporter with Associated Press, was accosted by a police officer who bundled him into a security hut and threatened to remove his accreditation unless he deleted the video footage he had captured outside the ground. Robbie Fowler, the Liverpool legend, spent most of the first half outside. His son, Jacob, and brother Scott were among those caught up in the carnage. Jason McAteer, another former Reds player, said his wife was mugged and his son was attacked. Jim Beglin, a double-winner with the Reds in 1986, called the scenes ""reprehensible."" Mike Gordon, one of Liverpool’s owners, and Marvin Matip, brother of Reds defender Joel, were also among the melee. Matip sheltered in a local restauarant with his pregnant girlfriend. Andy Robertson revealed that one of his friends had been refused entry, accused of presenting a fake ticket. “He luckily managed to get in because one of the club representatives sorted it,” Robertson told reporters afterwards. “But they said it was a fake, which I can assure you it wasn’t, so I think they were making it up at times and panicked. “For me it shouldn’t really happen, UEFA should have been better organised.” Others, such as Gary Lineker and Kelly Cates, shared their experiences from outside the ground on social media, their stories differing wildly from the ones being peddled by UEFA, the police and, shamefully, a number of French politicians. The game eventually kicked off at 9.36pm local time, UEFA ensuring that the pre-match show involving Camilla Cabello went ahead. There were boos from the Liverpool end as the Champions League anthem was played, and the club issued a statement during the game in which it condemned the “unacceptable” treatment of supporters, and said had “officially called for a formal investigation” into the causes. On the pitch, and with the atmosphere in the Liverpool end subdued, to say the least, Vinicius Junior’s second-half goal settled matters, but by that point UEFA had already begun to change its tune. The kick-off, it said now, was put back because “thousands of fans who had purchased fake tickets” had “blocked the turnstiles at the Liverpool end”, causing the delay. “What is it they say; the one who is lying is the one who changes their story?” one disgusted fan told GOAL. “First it was late arrivals, then it was fake tickets. I’m just surprised they didn’t use drunkenness as an excuse, for the full house.” The authorities’ position was made clear as the game headed into stoppage time. Hundreds of black-clad riot police made their way to the Liverpool end of the ground, lining up menacingly in front of supporters. At the other end, the jubilant Real Madrid fans had only a smattering of stewards in hi-vis vests for company. There was little or no trouble inside the ground, as the Reds section emptied rapidly after the final whistle, despite more inexplicably-closed exit gates. But outside the ground, the nightmare was about to restart. “There were gangs roaming around outside, looking to mug and attack Liverpool fans,” says one eye-witness. “We saw one lad have his watch robbed then my brother, who was a minute or so behind me, started shouting that someone had taken his phone and his money. “A few of them managed to catch the lad, but then four or five others came from nowhere. My brother had his face slashed, his mate had his head cut open, and another lad was bottled. “They walked to the police station and were basically told they weren’t interested. ‘Go to the hospital’ was the gist of it. “When they got to the hospital, there was a fella in there who had been hit by a metro train when running away from someone with a knife, there were loads who’d been beaten up or hit with bottles. It was grim.” Another fan encountered a fellow supporter who had been attacked by a group of youths. His head was bleeding and he feared he might have broken his leg. The victim was with his young son. Others tell similar tales. One journalist, Caoimhe O’Neill of The Athletic, describes her terror as a gang charged at her and a group of supporters outside. “I never thought I’d be glad to be leaving such a beautiful city,” she tweeted on Sunday morning. Plenty feel the same. GOAL spoke to several fans waiting for the Eurostar at Gare du Nord station on Sunday. All had stories to tell, all felt let down by the authorities. None are in a hurry to visit Paris or the Stade de France again any time soon. CL final disgrace …  Link: https://t.co/2Hie9stgzB pic.twitter.com/8gXXc2QYzO “The best way I can describe it,” says one, “is that it was like the 1980s had arrived and taken over. “I’ve seen trouble at European aways before. Athens 2007 was bad, but this was worse. It was a complete failure of the organisers and the authorities, and it could have been a lot worse than it was.” As it was, it was bad enough. “It’s put me off going again, if I’m honest,” says Reds fan Carl Clemente, who was caught up in the tear gas incident outside the ground with his nine-year-old son. “Obviously I’ll still support Liverpool, but I’ll definitely think twice about going to games. It was like a war zone, groups of locals charging the police, and the police responding with pepper spray. “Me and my lad were stood waiting for a taxi, and we were hit by pepper spray. I hit the deck, my lad was in tears. We couldn’t breathe properly, our eyes were stinging. “He’s nine years old. It was his first big European final. Do you think he’ll want to go again? I’m not even sure I do.” That, really, is the saddest part. This story is not about fan disorder or hooliganism. It isn’t about fake tickets or late arrivals or alcohol or misbehaviour. It’s about safety and security, about those who went to watch on a dream trip to watch their team - and paid a fortune for the privilege too, don't forget - and found themselves in the middle of a nightmare, because those who are supposed to organise didn't organise, and those who are supposed to protect didn't protect. As Kenny Dalglish tweeted afterwards: “nobody should ever be afraid to go to a football game.” Plenty of Liverpool fans were on Saturday night. Some didn’t even make it inside and some may not return. And it is UEFA and the French authorities who must answer the questions as to why.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/robbed-attacked-armed-police-liverpool-fans-champions-league/blt70097926d35c604d,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2277,Aubameyang feels ‘sad’ for Arsenal as Gunners’ top-four failure spoils any chance of Champions League reunion,"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang admits to feeling “sad” for Arsenal on the back of the Gunners’ failure to secure a top-four finish in 2021-22, with the Barcelona striker denied a potential Champions League reunion with his former club. The Gabonese striker, who hit 92 goals through 163 appearances for Premier League heavyweights before being frozen out and moved on in the last transfer window, has helped his current employers to a runner-up spot in La Liga. He is now readying himself for a return to elite European competition, but there is no chance of him crossing paths with Arsenal and heading back to Emirates Stadium when gracing an elite continental stage in 2022-23. The 32-year-old, who hit 13 goals for Barca after moving to Camp Nou, has told Sky Sports of the Gunners missing out on Champions League qualification once again: “Really close [to getting in the top four]. “I think they made a lot of improvements and I’m a bit sad because I wanted to catch them in the Champions League. I have a lot of friends over there. “But I’m wishing them all the best for next season and obviously, I think it’s going to be a good thing for them to get back to the Europa League as well. Hopefully, they can win it.” Arsenal let it slip 😫 pic.twitter.com/eXZsRb3Khz It looked for long periods in the 2021-22 campaign as though Arsenal would book return tickets to the Champions League. All too familiar struggles for consistency kicked in again, though, for Mikel Arteta’s side and they slipped down the table in the final weeks of the season. To rub salt into the wounds, as the Gunners finished in fifth, north London neighbours Tottenham were the ones to pip them to fourth place. Arsenal are now destined to spend a sixth consecutive season outside of the Champions League party, with Arsene Wenger overseeing their last involvement in that competition back in 2016-17.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/aubameyang-feels-sad-for-arsenal-as-gunners-top-four-failure/bltb4ff74300949b4b3,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6013,'Having Messi was like Phil Jackson having Michael Jordan' - Guardiola says he owes former Barcelona star a 'good bottle of wine',"Pep Guardiola says that he owes Lionel Messi “a good bottle of wine” and has compared the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner with basketball legend Michael Jordan. The pair won a plethora of honours while working together at Barcelona, including three La Liga titles, two Champions Leagues and two Copas del Rey. Guardiola, widely regarded as one of the best coaches in history, feels that his Barca side would still have been a great team without the Argentine, but not nearly as successful. Likening his former charge to a man often named as the greatest basketball player of all time, Guardiola told Ole: “What does Messi mean? Everything, everything, Messi is like Michael Jordan. “It's like when Phil Jackson could feel that feeling that everything was flowing and there were no problems. “I owe him a good bottle of wine to thank him for the contracts he allowed me to sign! “We had an amazing group of players who helped him when we were together at Barcelona in those four years. There were a lot of stars at the right time and the right age for everyone, with Xavi, Carles Puyol and Andres Iniesta too. “There was unique chemistry. Without Messi, we would still have won. But, would we have won so much? No, impossible.” While Guardiola continues to enjoy a successful coaching career with Manchester City, many believe that Messi's time at the very top of the game is coming to an end. Since swapping Barcelona for PSG in the summer, the attacker has failed to replicate the kind of form that helped the Blaugrana to countless pieces of silverware during his time at Camp Nou. Indeed, the Argentine was of little use to the French side as they crashed out of the Champions League on Wednesday after Karim Benzema's hat-trick fired Real Madrid through to the next stage.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-michael-jordan-guardiola-barcelona-good-bottle-wine/blt2cfd6d6f3e0d7320,Stephen Crawford,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4075,Is the Community Shield a major trophy & who has won it most? How English football's Super Cup is viewed,"Before a ball is kicked in anger during any given top-flight campaign, the Community Shield raises the curtain on another season by putting a first piece of silverware on the line. The Community Shield sees the reigning Premier League champions face off against the FA Cup holders, with first playing second from the previous year’s standings if the same side completed a domestic double a few months earlier. It may not be the most prestigious of prizes, but is the Community Shield considered to be a major honour and what do those competing for ultimate glory make of it? GOAL takes a look... While two of the top teams in English football compete for the right to lift the Community Shield, and winning is always a useful habit to get into, it is not considered to be a major trophy. The Football Association may consider it to be a top award, as it falls under their remit rather than that of the Premier League, but it will never sit alongside the likes of the FA Cup and League Cup. That is because a ‘major trophy’ is defined as being one in which competition is open to all teams from within a league system. With the Community Shield only featuring a couple of sides, it does not fit the criteria of being ‘major’ – at least not in England, as similar Super Cup events are held in higher regard elsewhere. In 2022, the Community Shield will be contested by title holders Manchester City and FA Cup winners Liverpool. One of those sides have graced the last four stagings of the event and are well versed in the demands of trying to open the season in style. Both Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp have taken the contest seriously, with the Spanish and German coaches placing greater emphasis on success than many onlookers in England. Back in 2019, after collecting another League Cup, City boss Guardiola said: “The Community Shield? Nobody counts it, that’s the question, I would like an answer. “In Spain and Germany it’s important. We have won two titles this season and have three to play (for) but everyone says one. “Why play if it doesn’t count? We could have longer holidays.” A year later, ahead of a showdown with Arsenal in 2020, Liverpool manager Klopp said: “It's a final. This is the first time that I realised nobody sees it like that to be honest. A 'curtain-raiser' is unbelievable. “We think constantly about the game and how we can prepare for it and then everyone thinks, 'Oh, do they really play?’ “That's not too cool, but it's how it is. I don't know exactly why people play this competition if it means nothing. Why don't we cancel it then? “In Germany, I won it five times, but nobody mentions it. We played every year. The Super Cup, you win it, nobody cares, you lose it and some care.” Unsurprisingly, given the number of league titles they have collected down the years, Manchester United are the most successful side in the history of the Community Shield – which was formerly known as the Charity Shield. The Red Devils have collected that piece of silverware on 21 occasions, placing them five victories clear of old adversaries Arsenal. Liverpool have emerged victorious on 15 occasions, but their last success came back in 2006, while City have six wins to their name after only emerging as a dominant force in English football following the arrival of billionaire owner Sheikh Mansour.

10618,Real Madrid vs Union Berlin: Prediction and Preview,"UEFA Champions League debuts don’t come more glamorous than a trip to the Santiago Bernabéu; look ahead to Wednesday’s intriguing duel with our Real Madrid vs Union Berlin prediction and preview. Before the 2019-20 season, Union Berlin had never been in the Bundesliga; they’ve played fourth-tier football this century and spent much of their existence in the shadow of city rivals Hertha Berlin. But on Wednesday, they will appear in the Champions League for the first time, and what an occasion it promises to be as they visit the home of European football’s most successful club, Real Madrid. Union will be Madrid’s 150th different opponent in European competition and the fifth team to make their Champions League bow against them after Inter Milan (1998), Roma (2001), BATE Borisov (2008) and FC Zürich (2009), all of whom lost. As an unsurprising contrast, Madrid will be playing a record 305th Champions League game and are big favourites to take their wins tally to 183 – their current haul of 182 is already more than any other club in the competition. It is, of course, a rather daunting prospect for Union, regardless of their undoubted excitement. This will be the 27th successive season Madrid have appeared in Europe’s elite competition, last absent in 1996-97, and they’ve scored at least once in each of their last 68 home Champions League outings. Further to that, just three of the previous 14 German clubs to feature in the Champions League won their opening match, and only one of those (Wolfsburg in 2009-10) came since the turn of the century. Nevertheless, Union aren’t complete European novices. They reached the group stage of the UEFA Europa Conference League in 2021-22 and then made it to the Europa League round of 16 last season. Their squad also includes several players with past European experience such as Robin Gosens, Brenden Aaronson, Kevin Volland, Robin Knoche, Josip Juranović, Lucas Tousart and, above all, Juventus and Italy great Leonardo Bonucci. They are only expected to be without vice-captain Rani Khedira, whose brother Sami used to play for Real Madrid, and András Schäfer due to injury. The home side will be missing Thibaut Courtois, Éder Militão, Dani Carvajal, Arda Güler and Vinícius Júnior, but Carlo Ancelotti confirmed on Tuesday that Luka Modrić is fit and will start the match in midfield. Real Madrid have won all of their first five La Liga matches this season, their best winning run of 2023. They’ll not be getting carried away, as they began 2022-23 with six successive victories and ultimately fell short of retaining their league crown, but it does put them in fine form ahead of their Champions League opener. Two new signings have contributed well, with England midfielder Jude Bellingham thriving under the pressure of playing in the famous white jersey after his big move. He’s scored five goals in as many games from midfield, putting him well on track to surpass the eight he netted in the Bundesliga for Borussia Dortmund last term, that being his best return for a single league campaign. Striker Joselu has chipped in with a couple of goals as well; the equaliser in the 2-1 win over Getafe before the international break, and the winner against Real Sociedad on Sunday. The 33-year-old’s arrival may have been somewhat unheralded given he joined on loan from Espanyol and would not be regarded by most as anywhere close to the standard of the player he essentially replaced, Karim Benzema, but he’s already showing his worth and will be aiming to score for a third game running on Wednesday. Union, on the other hand, have hit something of a rocky patch. They started the season with back-to-back 4-1 wins over Mainz and Darmstadt but have since been beaten 3-0 at home by RB Leipzig and 2-1 away to Wolfsburg. Coach Urs Fischer may feel they were a little unfortunate against Wolfsburg, however, given their chances amounted to 1.15 expected goals, compared to their hosts’ 0.35. Union also saw more of the ball, registering 532 attempted passes, their highest total in a Bundesliga match since the start of last season. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off on Wednesday, here is the Opta Power Ranking for each side: This won’t come as a huge surprise given their vastly varying degrees of Champions League pedigree, but the Opta supercomputer has Real Madrid as firm favourites for this encounter. In 10,000 simulations of this match, Madrid came out victorious on 70.8% of occasions; by the same notion, Union have just a 10.2% likelihood of taking all three points. The draw comes in at 19%, meaning there’s an overall 29.2% possibility of Union taking at least a point, odds that, in fairness, they’d probably take. Certainly, there’s no question that an away win would go down as the most significant result in Union’s history, and it’d significantly boost their hopes of getting out of Group C, with their pre-game qualification probability at 26.4%. Madrid are the most likely to get out of the group, doing so in 84.6% of simulations. The prediction model has them as fourth favourites to win the whole thing (7.1%), behind Manchester City (41.0%), Bayern Munich (9.9%) and Arsenal (7.9%). Real Madrid: Thibaut Courtois, Andriy Lunin, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Diego Piñeiro, Fran González, Lucas Cañizares, Dani Carvajal, Éder Militão, David Alaba, Nacho, Fran García, Antonio Rüdiger, Ferland Mendy, Rafel Obrador, Alvaro Carrillo, Marvel, Vinicius Tobias, Jude Bellingham, Toni Kroos, Luka Modrić, Eduardo Camavinga, Federico Valverde, Lucas Vázquez, Aurélien Tchouameni, Dani Ceballos, Brahim Díaz, Arda Güler, Mario Martín, Nicolás Paz, Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo, Joselu, Álvaro Rodríguez, Gonzalo. Head Coach: Carlo Ancelotti Union Berlin: Frederik Rønnow, Alexander Schwolow, Yannic Stein, Paul Jaeckel, Diogo Leite, Danilho Doekhi, Robin Gosens, Josip Juranović, Leonardo Bonucci, Jérôme Roussillon, Christopher Trimmel, Robin Knoche, Brenden Aaronson, Rani Khedira, Janik Haberer, Aïssa Laïdouni, Lucas Tousart, Alex Král, Aljoscha Kemlein, Laurenz Dehl, Kevin Volland, David Fofana, Kevin Behrens, Sheraldo Becker.

5539,How NYCFC tapped into their massive potential to earn MLS Cup triumph,"When New York City FC arrived in MLS six years ago, all of the talk was about potential, about the monster they could eventually become. They arrived in the league with much fanfare, with big names and big promises and with the backing of City Football Group. David Villa, Andrea Pirlo and Frank Lampard were meant to come to Yankee Stadium overnight and turn New York into America's glitziest soccer city and turn this club into MLS' marquee attraction. Those superstars are long gone, replaced by a perfectly matched core of young stars and overlooked diamonds in the rough. The glitz has worn off a bit, as has the glamour as other clubs have entered MLS and somehow managed even bigger and better introductions than NYCFC's those years ago. But, like their sister club over in Manchester, NYCFC are now champions, and they did it the hard way. Their triumph came against the Portland Timbers in a hostile and rainy Providence Park, one with a boisterous crowd and a very, very wet surface. It came in the pressure-cooker that is a penalty shootout after NYCFC threw away the lead on what could have been, should have been, the last kick of the game.  Up a goal with seconds, literal seconds, remaining, Felipe Mora scored a stunning last-gasp equalizer to keep Portland in the match. The goal forced extra time and, ultimately, penalties as the two teams were deadlocked at 1-1 through 120 minutes. The last kick, ultimately, was a missile of a penalty kick from Alexander Callens, one that sent Timbers fans home in tears and the NYCFC bench into delirium. Callens' penalty was the winner, but it was Sean Johnson who ultimately was the hero as the goalkeeper stopped the Timbers' first two penalties to seize control of the shootout. This NYCFC team is no longer one built on shining stars like Villa, Pirlo or Lampard, but it is built on heroes like Callens and Johnson, the team's captain. Over the last few years, NYCFC has been a team that has evolved and, ultimately, grown into one that can call itself a champion built from the ground right on up. Gone is Villa, but in is Valentin Castellanos, the MLS Golden Boot winner. Castellanos has been linked with a big-money move to Europe this winter, and, if that move comes, he'll leave the club as an MLS Cup hero. Castellanos' goal wasn't all his doing, as Timbers goalkeeper Steve Clark could have done better with the striker's header late in the first half. But what does that matter on a day like this? Scoring goals has been what Castellanos does and he got one more on Sunday, his biggest one yet. Gone is Lampard, but in is young star James Sands, a U.S. men's national team midfielder/defender hybrid who dominated Sunday's game. American soccer has seen Sands blossom into a heck of a young player over these last few years, and after starring at the Gold Cup this summer, his future could not be brighter. Sands, in many ways, represents NYCFC's present and future. He's the club's first true Homegrown star and there's plenty of reason to believe he won't be the last as the club continues to tap into the unprecedented potential of New York's youth. Pirlo's gone too, but there is Maxi Moralez, a player that has been this club's heart and soul for some time. It was Moralez who provided the assist on Castellanos' goal and who stepped up for a crucial penalty to put the Timbers on their back foot. For years, Moralez has done heavy-lifting for this club and, on Sunday, he and his teammates did a little bit more lifting with the MLS Cup in their hands. The run there was anything straightforward, like most things with this club in its brief existence. NYCFC toppled Atlanta United at home and then went to Gillette Stadium and took down the New England Revolution, the best regular-season team in MLS history. From there, NYCFC went into Philadelphia and took down a Union team missing half of its starting lineup due to Covid-19, booking their spot in this game. Like the run so far, this one wasn't pretty. It was nearly squandered thanks to Mora's goal. It was a typical final: sloppy, tight, nervy. But, in the end, for NYCFC at least, this night was magic. Even with this magic moment, NYCFC still hasn't fulfilled all of their potential. The stadium still isn't here, for starters, and there's still so much work to do when it comes to growing the game in New York City. As we've learned over the last few years, this is all part of one big process, one that will require just as much off-field politicking as much as on-field success. But nights like this will help get them there. NYCFC's MLS Cup win wasn't the culmination of a process nor the end of a long journey for a club just a few years into its existence. Rather, this MLS Cup triumph is simply just the start for a club that is only beginning to fulfill that massive potential that was promised years ago.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/how-nycfc-tapped-into-their-massive-potential-to-earn-mls/blt3efdefca062410e4,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

7149,"Lukaku 'only and ideal' replacement for Lewandowski, says former Bayern great Matthaus","Romelu Lukaku is the ""only and ideal alternative"" for Bayern Munich if Robert Lewandowski is to leave the club, according to former West Germany great Lothar Matthaus, who also believes that Sadio Mane will be a fine signing for the Bundesliga champions. The Chelsea striker is widely tipped to depart the Blues this summer to return to Inter after a frustrating first season back at Stamford Bridge, just as Lewandowski has indicated he will attempt to push through a move, preferably to Barcelona. With financial stumbling blocks preventing both the former's attempts to return to Serie A and the latter's pursuit of a Camp Nou switch, however, the transfer waters appear in constant flux.  Matthaus feels Bayern should capitalise on the uncertainty and challenge Inter to the signing of Lukaku, as he believes the Belgian is the only one who can succeed Lewandowski. ""I still see Lukaku as the only and ideal alternative,"" Matthaus wrote in his Sky Sport Germany column on the Belgium international being the ideal replacement for Lewandowski. ""[It's that] or Nagelsmann does [a] Guardiola, and Bayern play with three attackers, but without a striker. ""You would then also break new ground here and deviate from the Bayern system, because basically there was always a real nine at Bayern: Gerd Muller, [Giovane] Elber, [Claudio] Pizarro, [Miroslav] Klose, [Mario] Gomez, Lewandowski and many more. ""I still hope that Robert stays, and then Bayern would be able to really attack the Champions League with this offensive."" One face all but confirmed to definitely be at Allianz Arena next season however is outgoing Liverpool winger Mane, who looks set to seal a €41 million (£35m/$43m) move to the Bundesliga champions in the coming days. The arrival of the Senegal star - who steered his nation to both AFCON glory and Qatar 2022 qualification this year - will be a boost for the club, says Matthaus, who added: ""Mane's signing is fantastic. Not just for Bayern, but for the entire Bundesliga. That such a great footballer will play in our league is just great. ""Mane is an exceptional player. He has provided goals and assists with Liverpool in a manner and with a regularity that few other players in the world have been able to match in recent years. He is also a wonderful football ambassador for Senegal. I'm really happy to see him in the Bayern shirt.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lukaku-only-and-ideal-replacement-for-lewandowski-says/blt3fa33ea6dc6ed9a8,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10283,Pressing Cherries: How Andoni Iraola Turned Bournemouth’s Season Around,"Plenty thought Bournemouth would part with Andoni Iraola when they failed to win any of their first nine Premier League games. Now, they are among the division’s form teams. It must have been a strange feeling. Into stoppage time at Old Trafford, Dango Ouattara bundled his way past Manchester United goalkeeper André Onana and slid in what he thought was a fourth goal for Bournemouth. Unfortunately for the visitors, a VAR check showed the ball had grazed the back of Ouattara’s hand before he scored, so it was disallowed. If you had told any Bournemouth fan two months ago that they would be disappointed to only win 3-0 at Manchester United, they would probably have laughed in your face. We looked at Bournemouth’s situation a couple of months ago as they awaited their first win of the Premier League season. Things weren’t working out results-wise, but the underlying numbers seemed promising. That was ahead of them welcoming former boss Gary O’Neil back to the Vitality Stadium with his Wolves side. Many felt Bournemouth had rather harshly replaced O’Neil over the summer with Iraola, and with the former Portsmouth midfielder doing well at Molineux while his former club floundered, it appeared to be a decision that might have backfired. O’Neil may have continued to do well on the south coast had he stayed, but if showing patience with Iraola was a case of the club learning its lesson by not pulling the trigger early on their new manager this time, it seems to be paying off. After nine games in England’s top flight, former Rayo Vallecano boss Iraola had won just three points (D3 L6) and his team sat in the relegation zone. The Opta supercomputer was predicting their eventual drop down to the Championship unless they changed that trajectory quickly. They got their first win of the campaign against Burnley in their next game, though were then on the end of a Jérémy Doku-inspired 6-1 hammering at Manchester City. Since then, no team has won more points than Bournemouth in the Premier League. In fact, they are actually top of the form table for the last five games, ahead of title challengers Liverpool and Aston Villa on goal difference. The only game in which they have dropped points during that run was a 2-2 draw against in-form Villa, when Ollie Watkins needed to find a 90th-minute equaliser to stop it being another Bournemouth win. The perception of Spanish coaches has often been that they focus on a possession-based game, passing their opponents into submission, but Iraola heavily bases his approach around high pressing. In fact, across the big five European leagues in 2022-23, only Bayern Munich (73) forced more high turnovers that led to a shot than Iraola’s Rayo Vallecano (68). 68 – Across the big five European leagues in 2022-23, only Bayern Munich (73) forced more high turnovers that produced a shot than Andoni Iraola's Rayo Vallecano (68).73 – Bayern68 – Rayo Vallecano67 – Brighton63 – Napoli62 – Arsenal, PSGHunted. pic.twitter.com/yusUoCEddb He told Sky Sports in June how he has been influenced by Marcelo Bielsa, whom he played under for two years at Athletic Club. “I use a lot of exercises from Marcelo that I learned from him,” Iraola said. “I use a lot of things, especially with the ball. Offensively, his teams are very dynamic. He is willing to make all the runs to the space, he is ready to accept this kind of disorder, offensively.” You can see that in his Bournemouth side too. Clearly, they are not too focused on passing, given only five teams in the Premier League have averaged less than their 41.9% possession, and only three have attempted fewer passes. High turnovers are where they look to shine, not necessarily in terms of volume – nine other Premier League teams have made more than their 135 so far – but as far as effectiveness is concerned, they are starting to produce the goods.  Bournemouth’s six goals from high turnovers is more than any other Premier League side this season. By comparison, Manchester United lead the league for high turnovers (165) but are yet to see a single goal from any of them. In fact, across Europe’s big five leagues in 2023-24, only Bundesliga pair Stuttgart (5.2%) and Borussia Mönchengladbach (4.9%) have scored from a higher proportion of their high turnovers than Bournemouth (4.4%). Only the so-called ‘big six’ of Man City, Man Utd, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham have won possession in the final third of the pitch more often than Bournemouth, though the risk of a high-pressing approach is that it can leave a team open at the back if their opponents can beat that press. Across the first 11 matchdays in the Premier League this season, only Sheffield United faced more shots than Bournemouth. Their improvement in their last five games has been clear to see in more than just results, though, with only four teams attempting more shots (78), none having a higher expected goals (xG) than their 10.7 and only Arsenal (3.3) having a lower xG against than their 4.1. Despite that low xG tally, 10 teams have conceded fewer shots in that time, suggesting that Iraola’s men almost don’t mind the opposition having attempts at their goal, as long as they are low-quality chances. Across those last five matchdays, Bournemouth have given up non-penalty shots with an average xG of 0.06 – the lowest in the Premier League. Before this five-game run, that average was 0.11 and the joint-fourth highest in the competition. Of course, five games is a relatively small sample size. Bournemouth must keep this going, and there’s plenty of reasons to think they can. They have one of the kinder-looking runs of fixtures over the Christmas period, playing Luton (h), Nottingham Forest (a), Fulham (h) and Tottenham (a). That clash with Spurs on New Year’s Eve should be another good test of the substance of this Bournemouth side. Antoine Semenyo has been one of the success stories of the season so far, and he recently revealed the challenges of adapting to Iraola’s methods, but also expressed his belief that the team is getting up to speed. “It wasn’t easy,” the former Bristol City forward said. “There were quite a few changes and obviously the start of the season was a bit frustrating, but we knew it would come together. It’s properly clicked now and we’re showing everyone that we are a good team.” Literally leading from the front has been Dominic Solanke. The former Chelsea and Liverpool striker has scored eight goals in 16 league games in 2023-24, but he’s also putting in the hard graft for his manager. Only Son Heung-min (66) has made more than his 54 pressures in the final third leading to a turnover in the Premier League, while just five players have won possession in the final third more times than Solanke (15) this season. The all-action performances of Lewis Cook in midfield were typified in the win at Old Trafford. He may have lost possession 21 times that afternoon, but he also gained it back 16 times, twice as often as any of his teammates, making six interceptions. The 26-year-old has averaged 7.9 recoveries per 90 minutes this season, more than any other Bournemouth outfield player to play at least 45 minutes. Iraola has had to contend with some injury issues too, with summer signing Alex Scott only able to play 191 minutes in the Premier League so far. Tyler Adams is yet to take the field since his arrival from Leeds United, while the likes of Lloyd Kelly, Hamed Traorè and Max Aarons have all recently missed action due to injury. In the calendar year of 2023, Bournemouth have won 42 points from 37 games. Only Chelsea, Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest (all 39) have won fewer points of Premier League ever-presents in that time, but 20 of Bournemouth’s points have come in their last seven games. Prior to their first league win of the season against Burnley, Bournemouth were the third-favourites for the drop, according to the Opta supercomputer, at 66.9%. Their run in the seven games since have seen them leap up to 14th in the Premier League table and has reduced their relegation chances to just 1.4% of the 10,000 most recent supercomputer simulations of the 2023-24 Premier League season.

11787,Rúben Amorim and the Sporting Resurgence,"When Pedro Porro rattled home Sporting’s third of the night against German giants Borussia Dortmund on 24 November 2021, it was a moment of pure elation. With less than 10 minutes to go and now a 3-0 lead, it meant that the dream of qualifying for the last 16 of the UEFA Champions League for only the second time in their history was on the verge of becoming reality. After a few agonising minutes of injury time, the final whistle blew and Sporting had done it, against all odds. As well as Champions League success, Sporting are yet to lose a Primeira Liga game in 2021-22 at the time of writing and are level at the top with rivals FC Porto on 44 points. Last season, the club defied every expectation to win their first league title since 2001-02, ending nearly two decades of anguish and hurt. Just over a year before, Sporting, one of Portugal’s traditional Os Três Grandes or The Big Three, finished fourth in the league behind Porto, Benfica and Braga – only the fourth time they’d finished outside the top three in the 21st century. So just how has Rúben Amorim managed to transform Sporting’s fortunes and take them back to the top of Portuguese football over such a short period of time? Let’s examine Amorim’s impact and the Sporting resurgence. It cannot be understated just how much of a bad state Sporting were in prior to Amorim’s appointment. They kicked off the 2019-20 season with a 5-0 drubbing in the Supertaça, a defeat which hurt even more because it came at the hands of bitter Lisbon rivals Benfica, a team that Sporting hadn’t finished above in the league for 11 consecutive seasons. There aren’t many worse ways to begin a domestic campaign than losing Portuguese football’s curtain-raiser by a five-goal margin against your city rivals. The season kicked off, and after just five games and with only two wins on the board, manager Marcel Keizer was dismissed. His replacement was former Sporting U23 manager Leonel Pontes. However, he too was dismissed after just four league games without recording a single victory. It was only 27 September 2019 and amazingly Sporting were already looking for their third manager of the season. Silas took charge and steered the ship for 28 games, winning 17, drawing one but losing 10. Three hundred and fifty kilometres north, SC Braga were having their own managerial troubles. Ricardo Sá Pinto was dismissed in December following a poor run of league form and a fresh-faced Rúben Amorim – then in charge of Braga B – was given his opportunity to manage the senior side at just 34 years old. The former Portugal and Benfica midfielder took over, and his talent as a coach was instantly noticeable. Braga were once again playing with a swagger and a confidence. From 17 January to 15 February 2020, Braga played Porto twice, Sporting twice and Benfica once – about as tough a string of fixtures as you can get in Portugal. The result? Braga won all five matches, including the Taça da Liga final versus Sporting. Amorim had quickly collected his first piece of silverware in his managerial career. Sporting, and the rest of the league, quickly took note that there was something special about the young coach. Less than 10 days after Amorim’s Braga beat them at Estádio Municipal de Braga, he’d taken over as the new Sporting boss. Controversially, the Lions paid a whopping €15m to bring Amorim to Estádio José Alvalade – the third-highest release clause paid for a manager ever and a staggering figure for a Portuguese club to dish out. It was an even bigger risk given the fragmented relationship between the club’s board and their supporters, many of whom saw this decision to hire Amorim an example of reckless financial mismanagement. Amorim, however, was concerned with only two things: uniting the club and winning football matches. He presided over the final 11 league games of the Covid-19-interrupted 2019-20 season, winning six, drawing three and losing just twice. He continued to use a back three, just as he had at Braga, and like at his former club, it worked excellently. Despite his inexperience, it was Amorim who finished with the best points-per-game ratio out of the four managers who worked at Sporting that season (1.91). For all the positivity Amorim had brought during his short spell at this point, losses to Porto and Benfica in the space of 10 days to end the season was an indication of just how far off Sporting were. It was abundantly clear for all to see that Sporting’s biggest obstacle was the squad itself – sorely lacking both in depth and quality. A clear indication of just how poor Sporting’s squad had become was that their top goalscorer was Bruno Fernandes (eight goals), with the Portuguese star also their most creative player with seven assists. That’s fine under normal circumstances. It’s less ideal when the player had left the club midway through the campaign. In contrast, Benfica finished the season with two players tied on 18 goals each (Carlos Vinícius and Pizzi), Braga’s Paulinho finished with 17 and Porto’s Moussa Marega scored 12, meaning Sporting were the only club out of the top four without a player who managed double figures in the league. They were clearly in the weakest position out of Os Três Grandes, and their squad needed a serious revamp. One cost-effective way to get talent into the first team is to look to the academy. Sporting have always been a club that have been able to produce fantastic youth products, including world class talent such as Luís Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo. Under Amorim, those young talents have been allowed to shine. Toward the end of the 2019-20 season, he handed out debuts to Matheus Nunes (21 years old), Eduardo Quaresma (18), Nuno Mendes (17), Joelson Fernandes (17) and Tiago Tomás (18).  It was clear that Amorim was testing out the youth at his disposal, with an eye on which players could potentially contribute going into the new season. Though the campaign was ultimately a disappointment for Sporting, they knew going into the following season they had a manager with enthusiasm, confidence and most importantly, a clear idea of how he wanted his teams to play. 2020-21 would turn out to be a truly remarkable one. In the summer leading up to the 2020-21 campaign, Amorim got to work bringing in quality players who he knew could operate in his favoured 3-4-3 formation, and players he could trust to help Sporting compete at the top of Portuguese football once more. The club signed exciting young defender Pedro Porro on loan from Manchester City – a player tailor-made for the right-wing back position. Experienced central defender Zouhair Feddal arrived from Real Betis, Euro 2016 winner João Mário arrived on loan from Internazionale – a match made in heaven as Sporting sorely needed experience and intelligence in the middle of the park, while Mário arrived as a midfielder looking to reignite his career. They were able to partner him with João Palhinha, who, despite being a Sporting player, felt like a new signing. He had spent time at Moreirense, Belenenses and most recently at Braga on loan. During his time at Braga, he played for a short period under Amorim, so when the manager left Braga for Sporting, it was obvious Palhinha was once more going to be part of his plans. Thirty-three-year-old goalkeeper Antonio Adán arrived from Atlético Madrid as a player with experience but also looking to prove himself and get back to the Real Betis form that prompted Atléti to snap him up. After spending the majority his time at Atlético as an unused substitute, Sporting was his chance to become No. 1 once more. Sporting also looked to their own league for reinforcements, bringing in Bruno Tabata from Portimonense and former Benfica man Nuno Santos from Rio Ave. For all the smart signings Sporting made, they still needed a talisman. They needed someone to replace the gaping hole left by the departure of Bruno Fernandes, someone who Sporting could rely on in tough moments to provide a bit of magic, to break the lines, to get fans off their seat. That someone was Pedro ‘Pote’ Gonçalves. Pote had a solid first season back in Portugal with Famalicão the season before, following a stint at Wolves’ academy. He operated in a deeper role than we would see him take up at Sporting, often forming part of a three-man midfield. He was still able to manage seven goals and eight assists for the then-newly promoted side, a very respectable figure given where he was operating on the pitch. Amorim however, saw potential in Pote to play closer to goal and help fire his team toward glory. For the 2020-21 season, Amorim deployed Pote as the right-sided attacker in a 3-4-3/3-4-2-1 formation, but with the width being provided by the marauding Pedro Porro, Pote was allowed the freedom to come infield and play closer to the central striker, allowing him to get on the scoresheet more frequently. He found the back of the net a fantastic 23 times, finishing as the Primeira Liga’s top scorer. His goals contributed to 35% of Sporting’s total return – a tremendous contribution from a player in his first season as an out-and-out attacking player. His penchant for scoring extraordinary goals is highlighted by his expected goal overperformance in 2020-21: his 23 goals came from an xG total of just 11.6, overperforming by 11.4, which was more than any player across Portugal or the big five European leagues last season. The season began, and after expected 2-0 away wins at Paços and Portimonense, Sporting’s first big test was on Matchday 3 with the visit of Porto to Lisbon. Sporting trailed 2-1 until Luciano Vietto popped up with an 87th-minute equaliser, with the match ending 2-2. Late goals would be something that Sporting supporters would get used to as the season went on, with Amorim’s men becoming renowned for vital late goals. They scored a goal in the 90th minute or later in nine of their 34 matches in their title-winning season. Four of these goals were winners and one was an equaliser, meaning these five goals alone were worth nine points to Sporting. Come the end of the season, 11 of Sporting’s 26 wins were won by a one-goal margin. That MD3 encounter with Porto and the 2-2 draw vs. Famalicão two months later would be the only two games in which Sporting conceded more than once in a match until April 2021 – an 18-game run where they either kept a clean sheet or conceded only once. A week later they were at it again with another late, late show – Gonçalves popping up with an 81st-minute winner against Santa Clara. Sporting then embarked on an unbeaten run into the new year, with their next big clash coming against Benfica in February. The match-winner on this occasion? Midfield man Matheus Nunes, who popped up with a dramatic 92nd-minute winner to beat their city rivals 1-0. Amorim was refusing to get carried away, but you could sense that there was something special about this team, about their character and desire to win. Sporting continued on like this for the entire season, coming back when at times it didn’t look possible, grabbing late goals, keeping clean sheets and most importantly, winning games. Sporting finished the season with just one defeat: a 4-3 loss at the hands of Benfica just a week before the season finished. Sporting had lost their Invincibles crown, but the fans didn’t mind – they had secured their first Liga title in 19 years. Defensively, Sporting were incredible throughout the season. Club captain Sebástian Coates was a warrior throughout, contributing at both ends of the pitch. Playing at the heart of Amorim’s back three, Coates’ leadership, never-say-die attitude and defensive ability made him the perfect person to partner the young but super-talented Gonçalo Inácio. Coates finished the title-winning season as not only the highest-scoring defender in the competition (five goals), but he kept more clean sheets than any other defender (19) – statistics that helped him win the Liga Portugal best player award, something he thoroughly deserved.Antonio Adán was the goalkeeper with the most clean sheets, with him keeping 19 of Sporting’s 20 across the league campaign. They conceded just 20 goals – nine fewer than the next best (Porto’s 29) and allowed their opponents a league-low 24.7 expected goals. Across the top ranked six leagues in Europe, this was the tightest defence for xG of all 116 teams, with an average of just 0.73 allowed per match. How have Sporting changed for the better over the last two seasons compared to 2019-20? True, Amorim was in charge for the final 11 games of that poor campaign, but it wasn’t enough time to stamp his true playing style on the players at the club. 2019-20 saw Sporting average 6.6 high turnovers per game, but this has increased to 8.2 per game since 2020-21, with the Lisbon club trying to pressurise their opponents in their defensive third more often. This is backed up by Sporting’s average start distance of possessions on the pitch advancing by two metres on average since 2020-21. Further evidence of Amorim’s work on improving Sporting can be found via the pressed sequences metric – these measures the number of sequences starting in their defensive third where the opposition has three or fewer passes, and the sequence ends in their own half. In 2019-20, Sporting averaged 11.6 per game in the Portuguese top-flight (11th best in the league), but since 2020-21 they have increased this to 15.8 (3rd best). It is often said that the most difficult thing isn’t getting to the top, it’s staying there. In football this is no different. Sporting winning the title was a monumental moment for the club, but they knew going into the following season, both Porto and Benfica were going to up their levels, both in terms of squad quality and performances on the pitch. Sporting would also have to contend with the UEFA Champions League alongside domestic matters – a whole new task for Rúben Amorim. João Mário, who was so instrumental for Sporting during their title-winning campaign, remarkably departed from his parent club Inter and returned to Lisbon, but not for Sporting, opting instead to join fierce rivals Benfica. Nuno Mendes, the flying left wing back who was given his chance by Amorim the season before and attracted the attention of some of the top European clubs in the process, left Sporting to join French giants Paris Saint-Germain on loan with an option to buy, with Pablo Sarabia coming the other way, joining Sporting on loan. Amorim himself reinforced the Sporting full back positions with the arrivals of Matheus Reis, Rúben Vinagre and Ricardo Esgaio. Astonishingly, at the time of writing, Sporting are outperforming their title winning campaign. After 16 games of 2021-22, Sporting have won 14, drawn twice and are yet to lose. Compare this to this same point of their title-winning 2020-21 campaign, they’d won 13, drawn three and were unbeaten. Remarkably, they’ve managed to improve defensively also, having only conceded seven goals all season, two goals fewer than they had conceded from 16 matches in 2020-21. Adán has already kept 10 clean sheets from the first 16 games, and it’s not unfeasible that he could keep over 20 in the league this time around. Their start to the season is even more remarkable when you factor in some of the fixtures they have already played, beating Braga away and drawing at home with title rivals Porto. However, the standout so far this season was their 3-1 win over rivals Benfica at the Estádio da Luz – the place where they lost their Invincibles crown the season before. Matheus Nunes was in fantastic form; providing both a goal and an assist, and it was a match in which Sporting had to be disciplined and use all of their experience. Benfica dominated the ball with a huge 67% possession, but this was something Amorim was happy to concede. Sporting instead chose to let Benfica move up the pitch with the ball, always remaining switched on and ready to capitalise on a poor pass or a loose touch and spring a counter attack against Benfica’s high defensive line. It worked like a dream. Despite Benfica’s dominance in possession, Sporting limited them to just three shots on target compared to Sporting’s five. Sporting had more attempts overall too with 14 compared to Benfica’s 11. Fast forward to today, and Sporting are into the last 16 of the Champions League, where they will face Manchester City. They are unbeaten in the Primeira Liga. They are into the quarter-finals of the Taça de Portugal, and they are in the final four of the Taça da Liga. It is incredible to think of the position Sporting are in now compared to where they were prior to Amorim taking over. They are in a very good position to achieve a domestic treble and are competing with Europe’s elite in its premier club competition. Amorim has established himself as a top manager, and with each passing game, whether it be domestically or in Europe, the Portuguese coach is only furthering his reputation. He has brought the good times back to the Alvalade, and Sporting supporters will be hoping that Amorim’s work to change the culture at Sporting, to raise the expectations and his overall impact on the club, will remain intact long after he has moved on.

10548,Arsenal vs Manchester City: Prediction and Preview,"We look ahead to this clash between last season’s top two Premier League sides with our Arsenal vs Manchester City prediction and preview. Manchester City will look to stretch their Premier League winning run against Arsenal to a record-equalling 13 games in a row on Sunday, as Pep Guardiola’s side travel to the Emirates Stadium in north London for this top-of-the-table clash before the international break. Both Arsenal and Manchester City look set to be missing key players for this clash on Sunday. Bukayo Saka’s run of appearing in 87 consecutive Premier League games for Arsenal could come to an end after he was taken off injured in the midweek UEFA Champions League loss at Lens – that run is the longest current streak of all Premier League players and the longest streak ever in Arsenal’s club history in the competition. He would join an absence list for the Gunners alongside Gabriel Martinelli and Jurrien Timber. David Raya looks set to be in goal ahead of Aaron Ramsdale, having started five of their last six competitive games, while Thomas Partey could come back into the side alongside Declan Rice in midfield following an injury that’s kept him out since the 2-2 draw with Fulham in August. Reigning Premier League title holders Manchester City will be missing influential midfielders Kevin De Bruyne and Rodri. The Belgian star has been missing since coming off in the opening day win over Burnley and looks set to be out until at least Christmas. Rodri was sent off for violent conduct in Man City’s recent win over Nottingham Forest at the Etihad Stadium, therefore given a three-match ban. Since Rodri made his Premier League debut in August 2019, Man City have lost five of 15 matches without the Spaniard in the competition (W9 D1); by contrast, they have lost just five of their last 67 league games when Rodri has featured (W53 D9). Of the current City team, De Bruyne has scored the most Premier League goals against Arsenal (eight), while Rodri is one of the other three players to have scored more than once versus the Gunners in the competition alongside Erling Haaland (two) and Bernardo Silva (two). Ahead of the team news being announced, it looks very likely that City will still have Haaland at their disposal on Sunday, though. The striker was involved in four of Man City’s seven league goals against Arsenal last season and he has a decent record in London, overall. He’s scored in each of his last four Premier League appearances in the English capital – the only player to score in five in a row in the capital (for a team outside of London) is Ruud van Nistelrooy, who did so between September 2002 and September 2003. Arsenal have suffered a torrid record against Man City in the Premier League recently. They have lost 12 games in a row – and if they lose this game as well, it’ll equal a competition record for most consecutive defeats by one team versus another. The current record is held by both Wigan Athletic versus Manchester United and West Brom versus Manchester City (both 13 in a row). This is already Arsenal’s longest losing run against a single opponent in their league history. Former assistant to Pep Guardiola at Man City, Mikel Arteta, has beaten 23 of the 24 teams he’s faced as a manager in the Premier League. His only failure to pick up a win is against City, losing all seven previous meetings in the competition. Indeed, the Spaniard averages a minimum of at least one point-per-game against all other 23 clubs he has faced in the division. Arsenal haven’t kept a clean sheet in any of their last 16 Premier League games against Manchester City, since a 2-0 away win in January 2015. It’s their longest run without a league shutout against an opponent since a run of 30 against Manchester United between 1953 and 1968. The 2023-24 season may bring positive change for Arsenal, however. They have already enjoyed an FA Community Shield win over Man City this season, beating them on penalties after a 1-1 draw at Wembley Stadium. Of course, despite winning on penalties, that game will go down as a draw in the record books, meaning that Arsenal’s last competitive win over Man City was the 2019-20 FA Cup semi-final, when two goals from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang sealed a 2-0 victory. Manchester City lost 2-1 at Wolves last weekend in the Premier League, meaning there is a chance they could lose consecutive league matches for the first time in almost five years, last doing so in December 2018 versus Crystal Palace and Leicester City. That defeat came after an EFL Cup loss to Newcastle United three days prior, but they ended their mini two-game losing streak in all competitions with a 3-1 away win in the UCL at RB Leipzig on Wednesday night, thanks to goals from Phil Foden, Julián Álvarez and Jérémy Doku. Ederson will be hoping to keep out the Arsenal attack in this match, having kept just one clean sheet in his last seven competitive appearances for City. That being said, both Arsenal and Man City are among the strongest defensively this season across all competitions – only Chelsea (0.78) and Newcastle (0.80) have conceded fewer goals per game than Arsenal (0.82) and City (0.83) in all competitions in 2023-24. Despite seeing Gabriel Jesus open the scoring, Arsenal lost in midweek, suffering a 2-1 defeat in France against Lens in the Champions League. They last suffered back-to-back defeats in all competitions back in May, when losing to Brighton at the Emirates Stadium (3-0) and then at Nottingham Forest (1-0) a week later. That 2-1 loss at the Ligue 1 club ended a run of 11 games unbeaten across all competitions for Arteta’s side (W8 D3). Alongside rivals Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal are one of only two sides still unbeaten in the Premier League this season. This is their longest unbeaten start to a Premier League season since 2007-08, when they went 15 matches without defeat. Their seven games in 2023-24 so far have seen them defeat Forest, Crystal Palace, Manchester United, Everton and Bournemouth, while drawing 2-2 with both Spurs and Fulham at home. That 4-0 win over Bournemouth last weekend saw four different Gunners players score, with Saka, Martin Ødegaard, Kai Havertz and Ben White all finding the net. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off on Sunday, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Manchester City may be nervous on their travels to London for Sunday’s game following their shock 2-1 loss at Wolverhampton Wanderers last weekend, but the Opta supercomputer is here to soothe their fears. The pre-match prediction from the supercomputer sees Man City as the favourites, having won 46.5% of the 10,000 simulations ahead of the weekend. Arsenal may be the home side, but the Opta supercomputer’s simulations saw them end as victors on just 26.1% of occasions, with the draw occurring 27.4% of the time. Even with home advantage, a point against their title rivals wouldn’t be a terrible result for Mikel Arteta’s side – the home win/draw double chance standing at 53.5%. Before a ball is kicked in the Premier League this weekend, Manchester City are still the overwhelming favourites to win a record fourth English top-flight title in a row. Across the Opta supercomputer’s 10,000 simulations before this weekend’s Matchday 8 action, Man City won the Premier League on 86.0% of occasions, followed by Liverpool (9.6%) and Arsenal (3.4%), with Tottenham (0.5%) and Newcastle (0.3%) the outsiders.

6127,Man Utd-linked Marseille midfielder Kamara close to agreeing free transfer to Atletico Madrid,"Boubacar Kamara will see his contract at Marseille expire on June 30, with extension offers in France being knocked back, and GOAL has learned that Atletico Madrid are now leading the race for his signature. The Liga giants are confident that their efforts will be rewarded as they believe a highly-rated 22-year-old wants to make a switch to Wanda Metropolitano as a free agent this summer. Atleti have failed in a previous bid for Kamara, when a €5 million (£4m/$5m) approach was knocked back, but the Frenchman is now ready to take on a new challenge and is understood to be keen on working with Diego Simeone while gracing a Champions League stage. While there is confidence in the Rojiblancos camp that a deal for Kamara can be done, it has not been completed as yet. That is set to keep nerves jangling for now, with leading sides from across Europe also keeping a close eye on a promising French talent. Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich have been credited with interest, while Premier League heavyweights Manchester United, Tottenham and Southampton are also casting admiring glances in the direction of Marseille. All of those clubs would be able to offer Kamara are a bigger salary and signing bonus, with GOAL learning that the talented youngster is set to make a decision on his future in early April. Atleti accept that a transfer ball is now in the players’ court, with every effort made to convince him of their worth across a protracted chase that was first set in motion some two years ago. Simeone’s side cannot match the financial rewards on offer in England or Germany, but they believe that the sporting project they can present to an ambitious performer will allow them to prevail. Kamara may be Atletico’s top target when it comes to holding midfield reinforcements, but they are keeping an eye out for alternative targets. GOAL reported on March 11 that Barcelona utility man Sergi Roberto is another option that the Rojiblancos are exploring, as he is also set to drop into a free agent pool this summer. Uncertainty continues to reign there, though, with a La Masia academy graduate still hoping to agree fresh terms at Camp Nou, and that means that those in the Spanish capital will continue to keep much of their focus locked on Kamara.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-linked-marseille-midfielder-kamara-close-free/bltcd93a2eb3d3a3fa1,Ruben Uria,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

6597,Benzema nets late double as Real Madrid maintain 100% record with 3-1 victory over Espanyol,"WHAT HAPPENED? Vinicius Junior made it 1-0 early on with a composed finish before Joselu Mato levelled things up on the stroke of half time. Both sides had chances to score after the break, but it would be Madrid who found a winner, with Benzema popping up at the back post to volley home Rodrygo's cross in the 88th minute and then netting a fine free kick deep into stoppage time.  THE BIGGER PICTURE: This was a gritty win for Madrid who lost control of proceedings at the beginning of the first half. However, like champions do, they rallied to secure a very impressive three points. ALL EYES ON: This was the first game of the post-Casemiro era, and Aurelien Tchouameni was tasked with filling the Brazilian's shoes. Within 12 minutes he had an assist, and this set the tone for a promising display at the base of midfield. THE MATCH IN THREE PHOTOS: DID YOU KNOW? No player has a better goal-per-game percentage against Los Blancos in the 21st century than Espanyol scorer Joselu. He has managed seven strikes in just nine appearances. THE VERDICT: Ancelotti shuffled his pack in defence. That wasn't the only tactical tweak either. Casemiro? Never heard of him. On a night in which Lewandowski netted another brace, Benzema struggled... But of course, Benzema and Madrid can NEVER be written off! WHAT NEXT FOR REAL MADRID? Madrid are next in action when Real Betis - who have also won each of their three opening games - come to town on Saturday.

7150,Dortmund admit Man City offer for Haaland would be unmatchable as Watzke vows they'll find 'new talent',"Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke accepts any offer Manchester City submit for Erling Haaland would be unmatchable, but has also vowed the club will find a ""new talent"" if he leaves. City are thought to be leading the race to sign Haaland ahead of the summer transfer window, with it reported the 21-year-old has been offered a contract at Etihad Stadium that would make him the highest-paid player in the Premier League. Watzke has denied those ""rumours"" but also admits Dortmund would be unable to ""keep up financially"" if Man City were to launch a formal bid for the Norwegian striker. City are reportedly willing to invest €355 million (£301m/$396m) in Haaland, including a final transfer fee and salary costs, but the Dortmund chief is paying little attention to ongoing speculation. ""I've given up judging media rumours. Otherwise, my day would have to have 36 hours,"" Watzke told Sport Bild. ""We don't currently know anything specific from the player side, nor has anyone approached us. However, we cannot keep up financially if Manchester City comes in [for Haaland]."" Haaland is under contract at Dortmund until 2024, but Watzke acknowledges he could move on to pastures new this summer. Barcelona, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United have also been linked with the forward, who reportedly has a €75m (£64m/$84m) release clause. Watzke is confident BVB would be able to replace Haaland, though, and said: ""We've seen it a few times: we lost [Robert] Lewandowski to Bayern in 2014 and [Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang to Arsenal in 2018.  ""We've always created a new star. If Haaland leaves, we will find another new talent and develop it into a star, and that will also do the Bundesliga good."" RB Leipzig's Karim Adeyemi has been mooted as the man most likely to fill Haaland's boots at Westfalenstadion, but Watzke has said of a potential move: ""The same applies here: I will not confirm any transfer rumours.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/dortmund-man-city-haaland-unmatchable-watzke/blt47c30db57e9526c2,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11691,A Modric Masterclass: How the Midfield Magician Pulled Apart PSG,"Luka Modric is 36 years old. Yet to anyone watching him buzz around the Santiago Bernabéu last night, he looked like a player in the prime of his career. The truth is that he still is. To put his timelessness into perspective, here’s a list of outfielders aged older than Modric who have played more minutes than him in all competitions this year:  José Fonte, Raúl Albiol, Thiago Silva, Anthony Losilla, Dante and Cristiano Ronaldo.  Of the list there, perhaps only the age-defying Thiago Silva is still having a comparable influence on matches on the biggest stage. And, with respect, he’s not playing the more physically demanding role of a central midfielder. While Karim Benzema’s match-winning hat-trick against PSG on Wednesday night will rightly claim the plaudits, Modric put in one of the most imperious midfielder performances you’ll see. In truth, he’s been doing it all season. He has been pivotal for Real Madrid in Europe this term, as highlighted by the 48 contributions to his side’s shots in the Champions League this campaign, second to only Joshua Kimmich among central midfielders. The majority of those contributions are in the build-up play to shots, but there are still a healthy number of shots he takes himself or chances he creates for team-mates. And last night’s incredible game at the Bernabeu was the best example to date of his all-action, mercurial talent. Here, then, are the numbers behind his exceptional performance in the Spanish capital last night. We’ll come onto the defensive side of Modric’s performance last night shortly, but it was his ability in possession that defined the game.    Modric made the most touches for Real Madrid, completed the most passes for his side, and made the most passes in the final third of any player on the pitch. Simply put, he was central to everything Madrid did in possession. Modric has the ability to influence a game by controlling its tempo like few other footballers. A major factor to that is his spatial awareness. His anticipation of where opposition players will and will not be is spooky at times. Modric achieves that through constant scanning of his surroundings to ensure he receives the ball in space. It’s what appears to give him so much time on the ball. Combine that with impeccable close control and fantastic passing ability and you get a player who can dictate. A perfect example of this is below. Real Madrid have just won back possession in their right channel. The ball’s not even near to Modric yet, but he scans over his shoulder to identify the space in behind the PSG press. Eder Militao knocks it sideways to Toni Kroos who immediately looks inside for Modric. Before the pass is even made, Modric again scans over his shoulder. ‘Space still there? Yep, cool’. He’s not even looking at the ball for large moments in this passage of play. Modric receives the pass in space and Real Madrid are on their way. Now combine that scanning with incredible close skill and body control. After a PSG attack breaks down, the ball spins out to Kroos in the right-back position. Modric is in the middle of the park and knows he’s likely to be an out ball. A quick scan tells him Neymar is over his right shoulder. Kroos puts his foot on it and looks inside. Modric comes short to offer a passing option. Again, he scans his shoulder, reminding himself where his marker is. Modric’s spatial awareness lets him take an immediate first touch forward, using Neymar’s momentum against him to take him out of the game. Messi attempts to close him down. One shimmy and deft touch later and whoops, see you later. Vinicius Junior was a constant source of pain for PSG. His lighting quick movement meant he was able to make runs in behind Achraf Hakimi all night long, and he provided a superb carrying outlet for his team. Once he latched on to these through balls, his one-on-one dribbling ability enabled him to ghost past defenders to cut inside and create havoc. Because of his success in his matchups, Real unsurprisingly attacked most frequently down the left-hand side. Modric constantly looked to find him, particularly in the first half.   This plan was clear from the fifth minute. Modric drops deep the receive the ball from his centre back. He scans, as usual, to establish his surroundings. With time and space, he looks straight away for Vinicius over the top… … and finds him with laser precision. The winger draws a foul and Madrid win a free-kick in a threatening area. Another example on the 20th minute. Modric receives centrally and scans his shoulder before the ball arrives. Hakimi gets himself caught too high up the pitch and on the wrong side of Vinicius, who spins in behind. Modric punishes him with a slicing through ball and Vinicius is in behind again. It was a pattern Real Madrid looked to exploit throughout the game. Vinicius received eight passes during the match from the Croatian, with only Kroos (13) receiving more. Such is his grace and poise in possession, Modric’s work off the ball can often go unnoticed. But as well as a silky passing display, Modric put in an effervescent shift in midfield. He completed all four of his tackles, more than any other player on the pitch, shuttling from his typical left-sided central midfield position to the touchline on multiple occasions to win the ball back for his side. His touch map shows his work rate across the pitch. Modric showed his intent in the ninth minute. The ball is passed out to PSG’s right back, Hakimi, who sees space in between Madrid’s lines to burst into. But Modric follows his man all the way inside his own half to win possession back for his side: His defensive performance only got stronger as the game went on. Just after Benzema’s goal, with the crowd now sensing something special, the ball is played through to Vinicius on the left-hand side but is slightly overhit. Marquinhos covers and plays the ball to Hakimi. Modric is the furthest advanced of Madrid’s midfield trio and instigates the press. His arched run blocks off Hakimi’s ball inside to Danilo Pereira, while Benzema also forces the PSG player to go down the line. Modric anticipates that and steps across to win the ball. And then the one that really got the crowd whipped up into a frenzy: the crunching tackle on Lionel Messi. David Alaba’s shot from distance is blocked and the ball breaks to the Argentine. Madrid have got five players ahead of the ball and PSG can spring forward in transition. Messi sets off into the space behind Real Madrid’s midfield, with Modric tracking him the whole way. Such is Messi’s burst of pace that he’s effectively taken Madrid’s other two central midfielders – Valverde and Camavinga – out of the game too. Modric matches him stride for stride. Just before the camera changes to a lovely close-up angle of Modric putting in a crunching slide tackle to dispossess Messi, the frame before that shows that if Modric gets beaten here, PSG have a two on two, potentially a three on two. Modric nails him fairly and the ball goes out for a throw. The crowd are in raptures. And then came the defining moment of the match. The single passage of play that encapsulated this Modric performance. He started it and provided the killer touch. Modric funnels back into defence and intercepts a Neymar pass headed towards Messi. He carries the ball strongly out of defence, feints a ball into Benzema’s feet and charges through the heart of PSG’s midfield. He escapes the challenge of Neymar, before Presnel Kimpembe steps up rashly to make a play on the ball. His head on a swivel, he spots Vinicius making a run in behind just as he has done all game and slides the ball through. The combined carry and pass effectively takes six PSG defenders out of the game. Modric follows the play, showing great energy and desire to provide a receiving option. Vinicius obliges. And then the moment of genius. After that lung-busting run, Modric has the composure and skill to slide a reverse ball through to Benzema to level the tie. And from that moment, PSG’s capitulation was irreversible.  Benzema grabbed his third moments later, becoming the oldest hat-trick scorer in Champions League history. PSG duly add another collapse to their ever-growing list of knockout pain. And in the midst of the chaos, Luka Modric was the calmest of all.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2022/03/a-modric-masterclass-how-the-midfield-magician-pulled-apart-psg/,Oliver Hopkins,10/03/2022 7:29,the-analyst
2108,USMNT ace Aaronson gambles World Cup starting spot on £25m Leeds move,"Brenden Aaronson is one of the U.S. men's national team's biggest stars. That is a fact. Aaronson is also the second-most expensive American player in history. Also, indisputable, with only Christian Pulisic's $73 million (£57.6 million) move to Chelsea proving more lucrative than Aaronson's $30m (£25m) leap to Leeds. What is questionable, however, is what the next six months of Aaronson's career will look like. The 21-year-old star has taken a big risk by joining a team that only narrowly avoided relegation last seaosn. Of course, Aaronson's bold move is understandable. After all, there's a World Cup role to be seized between now and November, and the Premier League is the perfect place to prove oneself. Heading into four summer matches with the USMNT, Aaronson is one of several USMNT stars jostling for playing time on the road to Qatar. He's part of a winger pool that includes Pulisic, Timothy Weah and Gio Reyna – all players that battle it out in the world's top leagues. And, by Gregg Berhalter's admission, Aaronson is also part of a midfield group that includes players like Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah and Tyler Adams – all players that, once again, battle it out in the world's top leagues. That label will now apply to Aaronson, who has left Salzburg for Leeds in an effort to secure a starting spot in Qatar. While his place in the squad is beyond doubt, his exact national team role remains to be determined as he heads into a vital period. Under Leeds boss Jesse Marsch, he's well-placed to make a statement in the Premier League next season, as he's familiar with his fellow American's style of play, having played under him in Salzburg. And, in a team like Leeds that will need wingers that can press and then create on the counter, Aaronson seems like a perfect puzzle piece. However, at a club like Leeds, there won't be much time to adapt. They only barely survived relegation this season and were only able to sign Aaronson by avoiding the drop to the Championship. Even if there is reason for optimism around the club due to a signing like Aaronson, Leeds could well find themselves scrapping at the wrong end of the table next season too. That's the pessimistic view, though. The optimist will look at Leeds and see a coach that knows how to get the best out of his new signing, a club that can use the attacking juice, and a player that has proven more than ready to take that next step in his career. “I talked to Jesse a little bit about it,"" Aaronson said. ""The fans, they're amazing, and they're always going to support you. ""And while it's tough, maybe the media pressure and stuff like that, that's something I'm ready for. I want to challenge myself mentally and physically. “I got a little definition about the player that Leeds want, and I think I fit that. ""They celebrate a tackle like a goal, and I'm going to be that guy that's not only going to be the creative outlet or the guy that's going to be playing I guess, the 10 or winger or whatever, I'm going to be the guy that's going to be working hard too. ""And I think that's what Leeds is.” His ability to work hard has also made him a vital piece for the USMNT. With Reyna sidelined for nearly the entirety of World Cup qualifying, and Pulisic battling his own injury and form issues throughout the season, Aaronson asserted himself as a key cog. Indeed, he was arguably the USMNT's most vital player of 2021, scoring four goals throughout the year, including two in qualifiers. Despite that, though, he faces an uphill battle to earn a starting role. After all, Pulisic is all but undroppable, as he remains the USMNT's posterboy and most dynamic attacker. Reyna, meanwhile, may just be the American player with the highest ceiling, as the Dortmund star has only begun to scratch the surface of his potential. And that leaves Berhalter with three options: to use Aaronson as an impact sub, to drop either Pulisic or Reyna, or to get creative. On Tuesday, Berhalter hinted at the latter, saying he plans to start Aaronson in the midfield against Morroco. In a friendly that offers the U.S. a chance to experiment a bit, Berhalter is going to do just that by pushing Aaronson central to see if there's a way to get three of his most dynamic attackers on at the same time. “Yeah, I think he fits in both [a wing spot or a central spot]. We're going to play him in the middle to see how he does, use his mobility, try to get him between the lines,” said Berhalter. “It'll be interesting to see what he does in the game.” Regardless of how Aaronson does in the next few weeks, though, much will depend on his start at Leeds. The first six months of the European season will be vital across several positional battles, with the goalkeeper spot, in particular, one to watch in the coming months. Aaronson will have to adjust to a much tougher level of competition, break into Leeds first team and deal with the pressure of a massive pricetag, all while having one eye fixed on the World Cup. Something to satisfy the @LUFC fans who recently started following us. Welcome! 👋 pic.twitter.com/G1DWsZMLoY “Seeing the number just kind of go up and go up was crazy,” he said of his transfer fee. “They see you and value you as this player and that's why I'm grateful for Leeds, because they value me like this, and they think that I can be a big player in the future and a big player for them now. ""So for me, it's a surreal feeling. But everybody has to deal with this kind of stuff. I believe in myself, and I believe that I can be worth that fee. And that I can help Leeds."" Aaronson will also believe he can help the USMNT escape what should be a tough group. The U.S. will contend with England, Iran and one of Ukraine, Scotland or Wales in Qatar, meaning there's no certainty that their return to the big stage will be a fun one. But, as he prepares for his big move to England, Aaronson is already setting his sights on taking down his new home in Qatar. ""We're not going to go to the World Cup to be a participant; we're going there to win,"" he said. ""England's in our group, and we're going to try to win this game. So, I think that we have no fear and they should fear us.” It's a quote that shows, perhaps, a new side of Aaronson, one that the general public hasn't fully seen before. Aaronson, in the years since his breakthrough with the Philadelphia Union, has generally kept things simple, kept things humble, kept things airtight. He's been affable and personable, but never one to really stir the pot. So, in some ways, the above statement is one that is slightly out of character for a player that has always let his game do the talking. It's a policy that's served him well but he will have to make some even stronger statements on the pitch in the coming months if he is to arrive in Qatar as a certain starter for the USMNT.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/aaronson-big-leap-leeds-bigger-usmnt-role-qatar/blt7b7dcc78a64e7bdc,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3731,"Atletico pushed to 'madness' because of Man City time-wasting, says Koke","Atletico Madrid were pushed to ""madness"" because of Manchester City's time-wasting tactics, according to Koke, who insisted he was ""proud"" of his team's performance in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final. City progressed to the semi-finals of Europe's elite competition after holding Atletico to a 0-0 draw at Wanda Metropolitano on Wednesday night, with Kevin De Bruyne's first-leg strike ultimately earning Pep Guardiola's men a 1-0 aggregate victory. The contest was overshadowed by ugly scenes in stoppage time, though, with a melee sparked after Phil Foden went down theatrically in response to a rash follow-through challenge from Felipe. Stefan Savic angrily tried to pick Foden up from the floor before being pushed back by Oleksandr Zinchenko, with the former City defender then caught on camera trying to headbutt Raheem Sterling before pulling Jack Grealish's hair. Felipe was eventually shown a second yellow card for his initial tackle, but video footage showed that tensions between the two teams and staff continued to boil over the tunnel after the final whistle, with Grealish and Savic once again at the centre of the brawl. Koke defended his team-mates in a post-match interview, insisting they were unfairly provoked by City throughout the 90 minutes. The Spanish midfielder also claimed that if the shoe was on the other foot, Atletico would have been slammed for using underhand tactics to slow the match down. ""The match takes you to that madness when you see that you have chances and they drop to the ground and waste time,"" Koke said. ""Many times we are criticised for this situation, but today it was them. Let's see what people think of this. Today it has been seen, we are Atletico de Madrid and I am proud of this team. ""I'm proud of my team-mates for the effort. I have nothing to reproach the team with. I'm proud of everyone and the fans, who have lost, stayed to applaud us after the game.

3669,Arteta ready to 'get slapped again' over another Arsenal defeat as he tries to explain shock Brighton loss,"Mikel Arteta says his side must get ""slapped"" after their 2-1 loss to Brighton on Saturday. The Gunners were bested by Graham Potter's team at the Emirates Stadium, dealing a blow to their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League next season. Arsenal have now lost two matches in a row, having also lost 3-0 to Crystal Palace in the league on Monday. Arteta says his side must take a critical look at their performance again following the latest set back. ""What happens is we criticise ourselves a lot again. Get slapped again because we deserve it a lot and we were really poor in the first half and then lift ourselves up,"" he told reporters.  ""We know this road is taking ourselves nowhere, especially with where we want to be.  ""We have everything to play for in the last eight games and we have to have that energy and visualise the beautiful challenge that we have ahead and not sit back and see what happens."" ""We were sloppy on the ball again,"" he said.  ""We were second best in several situations, we didn’t gain any momentum, we didn’t show any purpose in the game, we didn’t play with the right speed and transform the game that Brighton proposed today.  ""The first chance they had, the only chance they had I think, they scored. We created a cold atmosphere that we weren’t comfortable with, but when we tried to change it, it was too late.  ""It was great not to give up but it was too late."" Arteta added: ""We created [the cold atmosphere].  ""The fans were here and they were exceptional, and you can see the moment we gave them something, what we tried.

5255,Luis Diaz: Who is the €80m Liverpool-linked star following in Falcao and James Rodriguez's footsteps at Porto?,"Though they are all now stars in their own right, Liverpool’s current attacking quartet all had relatively low-key starts to their careers. Sadio Mane was born in the most remote region of Senegal, Mohamed Salah grew up in a village far from Cairo, Roberto Firmino was basically an unknown in Brazil when playing for Figueirense, and Diogo Jota started out at tiny Pacos Ferreira in Portugal. That has allowed them to remain humble after becoming some of the most recognisable faces in the world game, and is one of the most important reasons behind their success. It is a trait shared by Luis Diaz, the latest forward to be linked with a move to Anfield. The Colombia winger is a very shy and down-to-earth individual, who will not forget his roots, even if he is becoming a superstar back home. His four goals at Copa America 2021 have sparked that new level of fame, though Diaz had already become a top performer for Porto, following the footsteps of his compatriots Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez in doing so. But the speedy wing wizard is keeping his feet firmly on the ground off the pitch, and is regarded as being a role model of a professional. Colombians tend to be open and outgoing people, but Diaz is different. He comes from Wayuu origins in the very north of the country, where people tend to be introverted. Jaime Moscote, his manager at Junior Barranquilla in 2017, recalled in a GOLCaracol interview: ""Lucho was one of the most reserved players, who was usually quiet and spoke very little. He is a very hard working guy, who came first to every training session and gave absolutely everything.” Diaz is the first top footballer to emerge from the Wayuu community, with the municipality of Barrancas one of the most neglected areas of Colombia, where hundreds of children reportedly die of hunger every year, and football scouting is less developed there. Lucho, therefore, did not study the game properly until the age of 18, when he was lucky enough to have been discovered by national legend Carlos Valderrama ahead of the unique South American tournament for indigenous people: the Copa Americana de Pueblos Indigenas.. Valderrama was in charge of the Colombia team in 2015, alongside his friend, former defender John Pocillo Diaz, and they noticed Lucho at the team’s trials, as the thin teenager impressed with his dribbling skills. ""We feared that it could be difficult for him, because he was very skinny and lost all the physical duels, but he still stood out amongst 400 candidates,"" Pocillo Diaz recalled. Valderrama, the most celebrated Colombian footballer in history, loved Lucho's ball control. Ronaldinho is Diaz's role model, and he always tried to invent tricks and enjoy himself with the ball, like the Brazilian superstar. Those efforts were not in vain, even though a lot of work was needed to become a proper footballer. ""Lucho had a big problem, because he had a habit of running with the ball looking at the ground, and often didn't even notice that he had reached the end of the field,” Pocillo Diaz continued. “He was very fast, possessed brilliant technical skills, and the ball stuck to his foot like glue, but he had to learn."" Colombia had a great tournament, reaching the final, and by 2016, Diaz had joined second division side Barranquilla FC, where the coach, Fernel Diaz, took him under his wing. ""Lucho can shoot from outside the area, he is comfortable with both feet, he can dribble, open defences up and score goals. He can do everything,"" he said. Malnutrition problems had to be addressed, and Diaz often ate the same meal twice in order to get stronger. By the time he joined the mighty Junior Barranquilla in 2017, he was much more athletic and ready to play in the top division. What followed in 2018 was a magnificent year for Diaz, during which he scored 13 league goals and was called-up to the national team for the first time. His debut in the yellow shirt was wildly celebrated in his hometown of Barrancas, where a huge screen was placed in the central square so that all the locals would be able to watch the game together. He became a major celebrity, but remained humble amidst his meteoric rise. The next step had to be chosen carefully, and Diaz waited for the right offer. He refused to join Cardiff City in 2018, and preferred Porto over Zenit in the summer of 2019, knowing that Estadio do Dragao was a superb springboard for numerous Colombian stars in the past. Stability was important too, and having Sergio Conceicao as his only coach in Portugal has clearly helped. Conceicao is a strict disciplinarian, but he loves flair in attack and gives Diaz a free hand to improvise at will.

I am very grateful for his confidence,"" Diaz told Marca during the 2020-21 season. The winger has most certainly improved during his time in Europe. He was a substitute for Colombia during the 2019 Copa America, but had grown into the team's best player by the time the 2021 edition came by last summer. Diaz had a phenomenal tournament in Brazil, topping the scoring charts alongside Lionel Messi. Each of them was different, and two were of outrageous quality – an incredible overhead volley against hosts Brazil, and a long- range screamer into the top corner versus Peru. #CopaAmérica 🏆¡QUÉ GOLAZO!

It is evident that the 25-year-old is even more self-confident this season after such a performance. Having scored six league goals in each of his first two seasons at Porto, he has netted 14 times in 18 leagues matches this term, while also scoring in both games against AC Milan in the Champions League. Despite that, his main focus remains on crossing and providing assists, and few left-wingers in Europe are more effective than Diaz right now. As well as his ability, his resilience has been heralded too, and no more so was that on show than against Estoril in early January. Porto were sensationally outplayed by the underdogs in the first half and were trailing 2-0 at the break, only for Diaz to lead a superb comeback. He started the move that led to the league leaders' first goal, scored the equaliser himself with six minutes to go, and then provided a sublime assist for teenager Chico Conceicao - the coach's son- to make it 3-2. ⚽ GOLOLuis Díaz 84'Liga Portugal bwin (#17) | Estoril Praia 2-2 FC Porto#LigaPortugalbwin #GDEPFCP pic.twitter.com/u1yMXTmF7g Will that be one of his last matches for Porto, though? The Dragons are reluctant to sell their best player in January, but there is an €80 million (£66.5m/$91m) release clause in his contract, and as he enters what should be his prime years, it could be the right time to move on. Liverpool are just one of Europe’s elite clubs to have shown a keen interest in the Colombian, and it is only natural given his remarkable talents. If Diaz does move to Anfield, he will not have any problems in finding a mutual language with Salah, Mane, Firmino and Jota, all of whom overcame major difficulties and needed a slice of luck on their way to superstardom. They remember where they came from, and so does Lucho, who dedicates his goals to his late grandmother, Rosaura. Liverpool fans could be about to hear a lot about her sooner rather than later.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/luis-diaz-80m-liverpool-linked-falcao-james-rodriguez-porto/blt15a0c6388fa584d5,Michael Yokhin,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

If they are placed in a team with players from that league, themselves and the other players will receive chemistry and boosts to their stats. Heroes will also give chemistry to players from the same nation as them. EA have reworked the chemistry system for FIFA 23, so player no longer need to be placed directly next to players from the same league or nation to give or receive chemistry. For example, in previous editions of FUT, Alisson and Mohamed Salah would not receive chemistry simply because they play for Liverpool. They would need to be directly placed next to someone from their club, league or nation in order to receive boosts to their stats. In the new edition to be released in September, they would now receive a boost as they both play for Liverpool. An example of how the Heroes in FUT 23 work is as follows.

11247,Morocco vs. Portugal: World Cup 2022 Prediction and Match Preview,"After defeating Spain on penalties in the last 16, Morocco face Portugal in the quarter-finals at Qatar 2022. We preview the game ahead of kick-off at the Al Thumama Stadium in Doha on Saturday, with added insight from our supercomputer model. Bruno Fernandes and Portugal are alert to the threat of an upset posed by Morocco in their World Cup quarter-final after the Atlas Lions stunned Spain and now eye tournament history. Walid Regragui’s side held La Roja to a 0-0 draw before beating them 3-0 on penalties, owing much to the saves of goalkeeper Yassine Bounou. Portugal had been effective if unspectacular in the group stage, but they released the handbrake in the last 16, demolishing Switzerland 6-1 in one of the finest performances by any team at Qatar 2022 after Goncalo Ramos came in for the benched Cristiano Ronaldo and scored a hat-trick. With the out-of-form and maligned Ronaldo out of the team, there was a perception of Portugal suddenly realising their potential without the 37-year-old holding them back, and Ramos’ performance – as he became the first player since 2002 to net a World Cup treble on his first start – was evidence of that. But Fernandes – involved in more goals (five) than any of his team-mates in this tournament – insists Portugal will not be taking anything for granted. You must allow functional cookies to continue. “It’s a difficult game,” he told reporters. “Morocco are a really good team. “They came first in the group, beat Spain, so we are aware of their qualities. We want to do the best game, as always, but we have to focus on ourselves and understand what we need to do to win our game. “That’s the most important thing: that we do our game, do our job to get through. We know it will be a really difficult game.” That is backed up by the fact Morocco have kept three clean sheets in four games at this World Cup, which is the most ever by an African side in a single edition of the tournament. But the task facing Morocco is monumental. If they do see off Portugal, Morocco will become the first African nation to reach the semi-finals of a World Cup. Each of the previous three African teams to reach a quarter-final were all eliminated in the last eight, with Cameroon (1990), Senegal (2002) and Ghana (2010) falling at this hurdle. Additionally, only two of the previous 11 knockout meetings between European and African teams at the World Cup have seen CAF sides progress, and one of those was Morocco’s shoot-out win over Spain. Morocco have been one of the best-supported nations in Qatar, and Regragui is calling on the support of the rest of the Arab world to help bridge the gap in quality to Portugal. “We cannot achieve anything without the Moroccan public,” he said. “Four days ago, they came to the hotel to ask for tickets, and many of them came from all over to encourage us. “We tell our supporters that we need them, especially in the quarter-finals, to write history. We also need Arab supporters; Algerians, Tunisians and Africans, and we know that many countries are behind us.” He was the Atlas Lions’ hero in the last 16, saving two penalties in the shoot-out – the other hit the post, but he seemed to have it covered anyway. But even outside of penalty shoot-outs, Bounou is a key man for Morocco as a dependable goalkeeper who was even nominated for FIFA’s Yashin Trophy – the prize given to the world’s best keeper – earlier this year. Will Fernando Santos stick to his guns and keep Ronaldo on the bench? Judging by the team’s performance against Switzerland, he should. Ramos had a hand in four goals against the Swiss and his hat-trick in 74 minutes was more knockout goals than Ronaldo has ever managed in the knockout stages of the World Cup (none in 531 minutes). With 3 goals and 1 assist, Gonçalo Ramos is the first person to register 4+ goal involvements in a single WC game since Oleg Salenko (6 vs. Cameroon in 1994).Salenko never appeared for Russia again… We highly doubt that will be the case for Gonçalo Ramos #FIFAWorldCup pic.twitter.com/wy6WpAusnu Portugal are firm favourites here, with Santos’ side having a 55.8% chance of progressing to the semi-finals in the 90 minutes. Morocco have an 18.8% likelihood of winning in normal time, with the draw and extra time, possibly followed by the dreaded penalty shootout is rated at 25.4%. Clearly then, while the Atlas Lions are the underdogs, they have a good opportunity of at least forcing extra-time, which did not work out too badly for them last time.

2666,'It hurts not having fans on our side' - Pique frustrated with whistling as he backs Barca to win Europa League ,"Gerard Pique has admitted that he and his Barcelona team-mates have been 'hurt' by whistling from the stands amid their lacklustre campaign - and has vowed that the club will win the Europa League to prove their naysayers wrong. Xavi's Blaugrana side earned a 1-1 draw against Napoli in their knockout round play-off first-leg clash at Camp Nou on Thursday, as Ferran Torres' penalty proved enough to ensure a stalemate heading into next week's second leg in Naples. It has been a trying campaign so far for the Catalan giants, with a sustained campaign of whistles against wantaway France international Ousmane Dembele the latest straw to compound issues - and now veteran defender Pique has acknowledged that it hurts for supporters to not back them to the hilt. ""The fans are free to express themselves as they wish, but while we're playing, the whistles are no good,"" the 35-year-old told Movistar. ""I understand that supporters are annoyed, but we'd like them to express that after the game. ""It's important not to have whistles during the match because it's distracting. It hurts not having the fans on side.""  While Koeman - aided by a superb Lionel Messi in his final campaign at the club - tasted Copa del Rey success last term - Barcelona's only credible route to silverware this season looks to be Europe's second-tier club competition. But Pique sees no reason why the Blaugrana cannot salvage success from their 2021-22 campaign, adding: ""I'm convinced we can win it. Playing like this we can win the Europa League. ""If we generate the same chances in the second leg, they will go in and we will go through. We want to win [the trophy].""  Barcelona's hopes of silverware may rest on the Europa League, but a failure to win that could well leave them out of the running for the Champions League next season too. The Blaugrana will need a top-four finish in La Liga to ensure a spot at the high table next term, leaving them walking a tightrope in domestic competition. They currently lie fourth, level on points with Atletico Madrid and with a game in hand.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/it-hurts-not-having-fans-on-our-side-pique-frustrated-with/bltb1357d1b358fb0f5,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10359,Soucek Unleashed: How Losing Declan Rice Has Been the Czech Midfielder’s Gain,"Losing a player as fundamental as Declan Rice can never be a good thing. Unless your name is Tomás Soucek. You get the sense that if it weren’t for the large plaster stuck in the middle of Tomás Soucek’s forehead that David Moyes would’ve kissed his Czech midfielder after he bailed him out yet again at the weekend. Soucek stole round the back post to volley home a 91st-minute winner for West Ham against Burnley, replicating the rescue act he’d performed against Nottingham Forest in the Hammers’ prior Premier League game. On that occasion, Soucek rose highest in the box to head home an 88th-minute winner. Those last-gasp clinchers helped Moyes’ team halt a run of four matches without a win, including three consecutive defeats, and saw them register back-to-back league victories for the first time since August. Soucek is not known for being especially prolific, but he’s currently on a four-game goalscoring streak, netting in his last two Premier League games as well as grabbing two goals to help Czechia qualify for Euro 2024 over the international break. They’ve been vital goals, too, with his strikes this league campaign winning five points for West Ham in the Premier League. Only four players (Son Heung-Min’s seven and Evan Ferguson, Erling Haaland and Bruno Fernandes all winning six) have earned more points for their teams with their goals. Soucek has a history of coming up clutch. Since he joined the club, West Ham have won six league games with match-winners scored after the 85th-minute – four of them have been scored by the big Czech. He now has six goals in all competitions for West Ham this term, already double the total he managed last campaign in 32 fewer matches, while he’s on course to eclipse the best-scoring season of his Hammers career (10 goals in his first full campaign at the club in 2020-21). His increased goalscoring is at least partly a result of being freed from the shackles of playing next to Declan Rice, who’s transition into a box-to-box midfielder required Soucek to sacrifice the offensive side of his game. Across the last two seasons, Soucek played 68% of his total league minutes as a defensive midfielder in a double pivot, typically next to Rice. This season, particularly with the introduction of Rice-replacement Edson Álvarez at the base of midfield, Soucek has shifted much further forward. Almost half of his minutes this campaign have come as a central attacking midfielder in a three behind the lone striker. With Álvarez and James Ward-Prowse anchoring the midfield behind him, Soucek can leave the progressive passing to that pair and focus on affecting the game from further upfield. Starting further up the pitch has enabled Soucek to get into attacking positions far more frequently than last season, where he returned just three goals in 50 games in all competitions. His attacking numbers are way up across the board, while on a per-90 basis he’s averaging more touches in the opposition’s box (3.2), more expected goals (0.33) and more shots (2.1) than he’s ever done in a West Ham shirt. Comparing his open-play touch map to that of last season illustrates just how often the midfielder is getting on the ball in central, high-value attacking areas, particularly in the opposition’s box. There have been times this season when Soucek’s been the furthest West Ham player forward, occupying one of the opposition’s centre-backs while the team’s nominal striker (Michail Antonio or more recently Jarrod Bowen) moves out wide. And starting from a more advanced position means Soucek can make his trademark late runs into the box, an element of his game that was so evident when he first arrived in east London. Deployed further forward plays to Soucek’s strengths. He’s not the most fluent passer and often struggled when asked to build play up from deep for West Ham last season. His 71.8% pass competition rate in open play was the second worst of all defensive and central midfielders to play at least 500 minutes last year – only Morgan Gibbs-White (70.3%) had a lower rate, but that is partly due to the fact the Nottingham Forest man is such a prolific crosser of the ball. Instead, Soucek can now look to dominate in the penalty area. He’s made 64 off-ball runs into the opposition’s box this season, ranking him fifth out of all central midfielders behind only Fernandes, Sean Longstaff, Julián Álvarez and Conor Gallagher, all of whom play for possession-dominant sides. His 6-foot-4 frame makes him a real aerial threat in the area – he’s attempted 12 headed shots this campaign, at least four more than any other midfielder, while his average of 2.0 shots per game inside the box is the highest he’s ever had in a Hammers shirt. There are elements to the way Moyes has deployed Soucek that are reminiscent of the way he used Marouane Fellaini, particularly at Everton. The Scot often played Fellaini in a role behind a central striker, a different option from the Belgian’s traditional position in a more defensive role, but one where he could use his physicality to great effect in the opposition box.  Soucek is a safety blanket in West Ham’s box too and is extremely effective at dealing with opposition set pieces. Of all midfielders, only teammate Álvarez (32) has made more clearances than his 31, while no midfielder can eclipse his 19 headed clearances. Soucek has long been a Moyes favourite. Since his debut in February 2020, Soucek has started more games (127) and played more minutes (11,241) than any West Ham player. In fact, since his first game in the competition, only five outfielders have played more minutes than him while just three (Longstaff, Bernardo Silva, and Pablo Fornals) have covered more ground per 90 minutes than Soucek’s 11.9km average. Soucek has rediscovered his goalscoring form at a perfect moment for Moyes, particularly with Antonio and Bowen suffering injuries. Losing Rice was obviously a massive, if inevitable, blow for West Ham over the summer, but Soucek’s fine form looks to be one of the few positive byproducts of that transfer.  You can always rely on Soucek for his durability and warrior-like presence around the pitch, but now his added threat in front of goal is what’s making him a real handful for opposition defences.

1736,England suffer stunning 4-0 home loss to Hungary with players booed during UEFA Nations League clash,"England suffered their worst home defeat for 94 years as they were stunned 4-0 at home by Hungary in their UEFA Nations League clash on Tuesday. It is the first time England have been beaten by four goals in a home game since a 5-1 loss to Scotland in 1928. England's players were soundly booed at the full-time whistle by the home fans at Molineux, with the pressure now on manager Gareth Southgate going into the World Cup later this year. While they dominated possession, England created precious little and were picked off by a clinical Hungarian side which scored from four of its five shots on target. It is the first time England have conceded four goals at home since 1953, when they went down 6-3 to the same opponents. 4 - Hungary are the first team to score four goals in an away match against England since the Hungarians themselves won 6-3 at Wembley in November 1953. Wolves. pic.twitter.com/2U1zzsbvsy Roland Sallai opened the scoring after 16 minutes with a smartly taken strike after Kalvin Phillips failed to clear a free kick, and doubled the advantage after 70 minutes following a Hungary counter-attack. Zsolt Nagy and Daniel Gazdag then capped a miserable night for Southgate and England, while John Stones was also sent off for a second bookable offence. The result means England stay bottom of their UEFA Nations League group and in danger of relegation to the second tier of the competition - but of bigger concern was the flat and uninspired performance, resulting in a home defeat by four goals without scoring for their first time ever. Boos as England leave the pitch pic.twitter.com/7cmCULyTYq GOAL's James Robson was at Molineux, and gives his view on a desperate night for England... That was hostile and toxic - and it leaves Gareth Southgate with a lot to think about over the summer. Let's not forget that England face two more difficult games in the next international window - against Italy away and Germany at home. Whether or not you value the Nations League, those are games laced with danger for a manager who has seen the fans turn on him less than a year after leading England to the Euros final. No doubt it felt like an over-reaction from the Molineux crowd, but supporters cannot be ignored. That was probably the worst reaction since Roy Hodgson led England to defeat against Iceland at the Euro 2016. Boos rang around the stadium, while Southgate had to endure chants of ""You don't know what you're doing"" and ""You're getting sacked in the morning."" The players, meanwhile, faced chants of ""Shame on you"" as they went to applaud the crowd at the end. This was a miserable end to a miserable quartet of games. It was a hapless performance that deserves all the criticism it gets, but to call for Southgate's head is remarkable, given his achievements as England manager. For all of this success, the nature of defeats to Croatia at the World Cup and Italy at the Euros left him open to criticism over his ability to get England over the line. That will, no doubt, be used as ammunition against him as he faces calls to be sacked. England captain Harry Kane told Channel 4: ""A disappointing night. First half we created enough chances to score but it has been the story of our Nations League, we have not quite had the cutting edge. ""Second half was not acceptable after going 2-0 down. It is not the time to panic, we have to the heads up and come back stronger in September. ""Let's not forget where we have come from, our first final in 60 years [at Euro 2020], a semi-finals in the World Cup compared to where we have been in the last 50 years. I understand the fans' frustration, we will keep working to try and have a successful World Cup."" When asked about the boos aimed at Southgate and whether the manager's future is in question, Kane said: ""It's not even a question I should be answering."" As bad as England were, Hungary fully earned a historic win. They were the first side to score four goals away to England since the great Magyar side of Ferenc Puskas, which won 6-3 at Wembley in 1953. After the game, Hungary manager Marco Rossi threw his support behind Southgate, saying: ""Everybody must be aware sometimes these kind of results can happen. They [England] didn’t produce the right effort. ""4-0 is difficult to accept, but I think Southgate proved he is quite a good coach. They [England] are absolutely on the top level and must follow the track they followed until now. I am convinced they will give to you a lot of joy in the next World Cup. I am sure of that.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-hungary-defeat-players-booed-uefa-nations-league/blta46e12175466cd77,Emma Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
629,Arsenal's £45m bargain - How 'incredible' Jesus has transformed Arteta's attack,"Two games, two goals, six points. The impact Gabriel Jesus has made at Arsenal since his move from Manchester City this summer has been immediate. The Brazil international has been a sensation from the moment he walked through the doors in north London, transforming an attack that last season had looked largely stale and one-paced, especially in the central areas. Jesus served notice of his intentions during pre-season, scoring seven times in five appearances.  An excellent Premier League debut in the 2-0 opening day win at Crystal Palace followed and then last weekend the 25-year-old announced himself to the Emirates Stadium in thrilling style, becoming the first Arsenal player in the Premier League era to score twice for the club on his home debut. Jesus also registered two assists in the 4-2 success against Leicester City, making him the first Arsenal player since Alexis Sanchez in 2016 to have four direct goal involvements in a league game, as well as the first since Theo Walcott way back in 2012 to get two or more goals and assists in the same match. So it’s no wonder the £45 million ($53.7m) summer addition, a transfer fee that already looks like a bargain, has dominated the headlines ahead of this Saturday’s trip to Bournemouth. “That's the standard,” Mikel Arteta said, following Jesus’ demolition of Leicester. “I wouldn't like to play against him. I have never been a defender but I can imagine that they don't enjoy it.” Arsenal’s problem last season was clear for all to see. Goals, or the lack of them, was a continued issue.  Whether it was during the opening months of the campaign when the misfiring Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was still there, or when Alexandre Lacazette was leading the line following Aubameyang’s initial banishment from the squad and subsequent departure to Barcelona. Lacazette scored just twice from open play in the league last season, a figure Jesus matched in just 12 first half minutes against Leicester last weekend. But the impact Jesus has made on this Arsenal team is not just about goals, it goes far further than that. For the first time in a long time, the Gunners now have a presence inside the box. While Lacazette did plenty of good work from deep last season and linked up well with runners going beyond him, he rarely got himself into positions that would trouble the opposition centre-back. In his 20 Premier League starts last season, the Frenchman had just 31 touches of the ball inside the penalty area. Jesus has already had 26 in his first two Arsenal appearances. He has also taken eight shots from inside the 18 yard box during those games. It took Lacazette until his ninth start (Boxing Day) last season to hit that number. Jesus’ impact has been remarkable and Arsenal now look a totally different proposition going forward as a result. “The work he does for the team is unbelievable,” Granit Xhaka said, while discussing his new team-mate. “We're more than happy.” Happy would be an understatement, if you were looking for a word to describe how those at Arsenal feel about Jesus’ first few months at the club. They were always convinced he would make a difference, that’s why they resisted the urge to dip into the transfer market in January to find a replacement for Aubameyang. But the ease in which he has adapted and the way he has settled so quickly has been a huge bonus to Arteta and his team. With Jesus at the head of the frontline, Arsenal have a fluidity to the attack that they were desperately missing last season. His relationship with Gabriel Martinelli has immediately caught the eye, with the two Brazilians linking up and interchanging positions exceptionally well on the left hand side during the opening two league games. “He’s an example [to others],” said Oleksandr Zinchenko, who - like Jesus - arrived at Arsenal from Manchester City this summer. “He was good during all the years I’ve spent with him. He’s an incredible player, always hungry for goals which is the best quality as a striker. He doesn’t stop at all. “He’s the guy who is always happy for the team. The team is always first and the club always in front of any individual thing.” It’s that type of character that has made Jesus such an immediate hit at Arsenal. While his impact on the pitch has been obvious for all to see, he has also impressed away from the public eye - with his personality and his work ethic impressing team-mates and club staff. One of the big reasons he opted to join Arsenal over multiple other options this summer, was the responsibility that Arteta was offering him. At 25, the Gunners boss was adamant that Jesus was ready to become a real leader and he has come in and taken on that type of role within the changing room, so much so that Arteta has named him in his three-man leadership group this season, alongside captain Martin Odegaard and Granit Xhaka. Club sources talk glowingly of Jesus and the way he has conducted himself following his arrival. Understandably he has forged a close bond with the Brazilian contingent at Arsenal and has taken summer signing Marquinhos under his wing, but he and the other Portuguese speakers are all ensuring they communicate in English as much as possible to avoid the potential for anyone feeling left out. Arsenal and Jesus’ focus is now on Saturday’s trip to Bournemouth and the opportunity to begin a Premier League season with three successive wins for the first time in 16 years. The Brazilian’s impressive start to life with the Gunners has helped lift the spirits after such a demoralising ending to the 2021/22 campaign and Arteta will be desperate to ensure his side continue to build on the momentum they have picked up following the wins against Palace and Leicester. And with Jesus in the type of form he is in right now, few would bet against Arteta’s side doing exactly that at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday evening.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-bargain-how-jesus-transformed-arteta-attack/blt7fa7a794f7b85f46,Charles Watts,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

706,AC Milan fan threatens leg amputation over Leao transfer rumours - and forward responds,"AC Milan's Rafael Leao has responded to a fan that threatened to amputate his leg if the forward does not sign a new contract at San Siro this summer. Leao, whose current deal is due to expire in 2024, has spent the last three years of his career on Milan's books and played a vital role in their run to Scudetto glory last season. The Italian champions are reportedly working to tie the 23-year-old down to fresh terms, but he has been linked with a summer transfer amid links with top clubs such as Chelsea - which has been a source of great distress for one Rossoneri supporter. The fan in question happens to have a tattoo of Leao on his lower leg, which they showed off in a video posted on their Twitter account on July 14. The account, created under the name Gabriele, also included a rather disturbing caption. ""If he [Leao] doesn't renew I'll cut my leg,"" the caption read. 😭😭😭😭😭🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 The post has received over 700 likes, and has even been seen by Leao, who has replied directly in order to try and dissuade the supporter from carrying out his threat. The Portugal international simply wrote back with a series of crying face and prayer hand emojis - picking up over 2000 likes for himself in the process. Leao recorded 11 goals and eight assists in 34 Serie A outings for Milan in 2021-22 to help them land their first title in 11 years. The talented attacker addressed speculation over his future mid-way through the campaign, telling DAZN: ""I’m happy with AC Milan and I want to make history here. I’m really loving my life with this club."" Leao also confirmed that his lawyers were in direct talks with Milan officials over a contract extension, and recent reports suggest he has been offered a new five-year deal.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ac-milan-fan-threatens-leg-amputation-over-leao-transfer-rumours-/blt13e9fe047b34959d,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10336,Goals Galore: How the Premier League is Producing More Goals Than Ever Before,"With more goals being scored than ever before in the Premier League, we take a look into the numbers and look at some potential reasons for the rise in goals and entertainment. The six-goal thriller played out by Manchester City and Tottenham on Sunday afternoon was nothing we shouldn’t have expected. It was the culmination of a day of incredible Premier League action, in a season of goals, goals, and more goals; more than we’ve ever seen before in the Premier League, in fact. The five games played on Sunday produced a whopping 24 goals, taking the average in the top flight in 2023-24 to 3.16 per game – higher than in any other Premier League campaign and the most in the top flight since 1964-65, back in an era when the First Division produced infamous days like this: And it hasn’t just a been small increase this season. This is the first time the seasonal average has been above 2.85 goals per game since the 1960s. And it’s way over that. There wasn’t a single clean sheet on Sunday; Premier League games have averaged 0.4 clean sheets per game this season, the lowest rate ever seen in the Premier League era and the lowest in the top flight since 1961-62. Premier League games are producing more entertainment than ever. This glut of goals follows a trend over recent years that is also being seen further down the divisions. Both the Championship and League Two are seeing a higher rate of goals per game than in any other season in any recent decade. Of the top four tiers, only League One hasn’t seen a dramatic uptick in goals scored, with its 2023-24 rate of 2.54 goals per game bucking the trend, lower even than the division’s rate last season (2.56). So, what’s the reason for all this entertainment in the Premier League? (And yes, we’re here to dig into, analyse and suck the fun out of the numbers, rather than just sit back enjoy the increase in goals.) First of all, professional football is simply more attacking these days. Right down the pyramid in England, it is increasingly the norm for teams to play possession football, to look to dominate the ball and assert themselves rather than sit back, soak up pressure in the hope of shutting the opposition out and potentially nick something on the break. Even as low down as League Two, there are plenty of teams who look to play this way, and in the Premier League almost every team will do. This type of football has also been coupled with more teams pressing high up the pitch – front-foot defending to go with front-foot possession-based football – and the standard of pressing in the Premier League increasing, too. With teams encouraged to take more risks on the ball and opponents pressing more willingly, we are seeing more high turnovers per game (16.5) than in any other Premier League season on record (since 2010-11).  It follows that we are also seeing more high turnovers which lead to a goal scored (0.34 per game) than in any other Premier League campaign. There’s only ever been one season in which that rate has been above 0.25 per game (0.26 last season), with most seasons averaging between 0.1 and 0.2 goal-ending high turnovers per game. In other words, that rate has as good as doubled this term compared to most recent campaigns. One of the main explanations for the added entertainment, however, has been the increase in playing time as a result of the refereeing directives to crack down on time-wasting. We are seeing more time added on to matches than ever before, and a significant increase in ball-in-play time, as a result. Premier League matches are, on average, three minutes and 21 seconds longer than last season, while games in the Championship, League One and League Two are each around two minutes longer. In the Premier League, the ball has been in play for three minutes and 34 seconds longer this season, with the lower three tiers each seeing the ball in play for at least five minutes more. Incredibly, in League Two, the ball is in play for seven minutes and 28 seconds more in 2023-24 than in 2022-23. More game time means more goals; makes sense, right? However, the percentage increase in ball-in-play time this season compared to last in the Premier League is 6.5% (from 55 mins, 52 seconds up to 58 mins, 26 seconds), which can’t account alone for the dramatic rise in goals. This season has seen a 10.9% rise in goals per game. A bit more game time shouldn’t mean a lot more goals, should it? But football is played differently in second-half injury-time. There is more urgency to push for a goal and now, with upwards of 10 minutes often added to games, when the clock hits 90 minutes, there is usually still time to score two goals and turn a defeat into a win, as Tottenham did against Sheffield United, and Manchester United did against Brentford. Teams have more time to push for a winner and so have more belief that throwing the kitchen sink at the opposition might be worthwhile. That extra game time and extra effort might go some way to explaining why so many teams are enduring nightmare injury crises right now. Newcastle played Man Utd at the weekend without 11 first-team players, and three other teams – Chelsea, Spurs and Brentford – are currently missing 10 players through injury, according to premierinjuries.com. 31 – There have been 31 red cards in the 140 Premier League games this season, already more than they were in all 380 matches in the division last term (30). Clampdown. pic.twitter.com/gFHcj4slUi There have also been more red cards in the Premier League this season resulting in more suspensions. Injury lists and suspensions have left teams weaker in key positions – Spurs have been playing two full-backs at centre-back in recent weeks, for example – and with so many teams boasting vast quality in attack across the Premier League, it is no surprise that defences have struggled to cope. There are plenty of good defenders, but there are also mismatches in quality all over the Premier League. Teams are also looking for their defenders to contribute more in attack than ever before, so defensive attributes will be sacrificed for attacking ability more commonly than before. Another contributing factor has been the growing gulf in quality between the top and the bottom of the Premier League and the high-scoring affairs those match-ups have produced. Already this season, we have seen eight instances of a team scoring five or more goals in a match, including the biggest ever away win in Premier League history, when Newcastle won 8-0 at Sheffield United in September. It’s a gulf that has been expanding for a few years now, with the richest at the top of the league getting richer and those who come into the division often unable to compete. That will at least be part of the reason we are seeing an upward trend in goals scored, as this graph showing the rolling 10-season average for top-flight goals scored highlights. Mismatches are far from the only cause, though, as proved by Sunday’s 4-3 win for Liverpool over Fulham, Chelsea’s 3-2 win over Brighton, a 2-2 draw between Bournemouth and Aston Villa, and the 3-3 draw at the Etihad. We are seeing a record-breaking season for goals scored and overall entertainment. Long may it continue. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new football newsletter to receive exclusive weekly content.

7650,Mourinho predicts Premier League and Champions League winners this season,"Jose Mourinho has named the teams that he backs to win the Premier League and Champions League this season.  He also revealed which of his former sides he would 'love' to go on and claim honours this campaign. The Portuguese coach is out of work having been dismissed by Roma in January, once again succumbing to the third-season syndrome that has stalked his career. Appearing on Rio Ferdinand's FIVE YouTube channel, he regaled viewers with talk of his immediate future, his struggle to gut the Manchester United dressing room of rotten eggs, and his preferred midfielder from England's golden generation. On top of all that, he gave his definitive predictions on the Premier League and Champions League.   On the domestic front, he briefly mulled over Manchester City and Liverpool, before putting his eggs in Pep Guardiola's basket by favouring his side. 'Champions League, I would say City or Real Madrid,' the Football.com global ambassador said. 'If somebody outside [those two] wins it, for me, it would be a great surprise. 'I would love Real Madrid to win it again for the club and for Carlo [Ancelotti]. I don't know, Bayern Munich can do it, Paris Saint-Germain. 'Looking at potential, I think City/Liverpool for the Premier [League], City/Real for the Champions [League].' In fairness to Mourinho, it would have been hard to back former clubs such as Manchester United and Chelsea for the Champions League considering they aren't in it, and they don't have much hope in England's top flight either. His interview with Ferdinand and Stephen Howson was wide-ranging and at times emotional. He admitted that his exit from Roma, where he won the Europa Conference League and reached a Europa League final, was the one that 'hurt' him 'the most.' 'I gave everything, I gave my heart, I gave even some options that could be considered not very clever from the professional point of view,' he said. 'I refused some great working opportunities. The first one was very hard to refuse because it was Portugal national team, probably the best Portugal national team ever and three years before a World Cup.    'Then I had a big one from Saudi and I didn't hide it at the time because it was really big. 'I did it - normally I a very pragmatic in my choices, very professional in my choices and I try to be very emotionally controlled and you could see that when I left other clubs after winning finals. 'In this case I was not pragmatic, I was emotional and I gave everything. So in the end when I left, I left hurt. I had the great feeling that I gave so much happiness to the people. 'Two European finals in a row doesn't happen too often, especially in a club like Roma which doesn't have a big history of European success. 'Then I was walking in the street and the people were like ""take us to Dublin, take us to Dublin"" [for this year's Europa League final] and so I had that in my mind, the third European final in a row. 'But you have to respect, the owner is always the owner. It's not the first time I left a club, it is probably the first time I am feeling it in a different way. 'You move on, you try to learn from the experience be better for the next one.' All three parts of the interview are available on FIVE's YouTube - The full interview with JosÃ© Mourinho will be available on @FIVEUKâs audio platforms, Spotify, Apple and Google Podcasts.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Mourinho-predicts-Premier-League-and-Champions-League-winners-this-season/3302658,,18 hours ago,all-football-app
428,Why was Kai Havertz not sent off for his elbow on Dan Burn in Chelsea vs Newcastle? ,"Kai Havertz found himself at the centre of a controversial incident during Chelsea’s clash with Newcastle at Stamford Bridge, with the German forward catching Premier League rival Dan Burn with a raised elbow. A coming together between the Blues attacker and Magpies defender occurred five minutes before half-time of an entertaining encounter that delivered plenty of passion despite chances proving hard to come by at both ends of the field. Havertz was allowed to stay on the pitch after tangling with Burn, but questions were asked of whether a man with Champions League and Club World Cup-winning goals to his name should have been shown a red card. Both men looked to challenge for a high ball in the 40th minute of a keenly-fought contest in west London – in what was Chelsea’s first outing on home soil since club owner Roman Abramovich saw his assets frozen by the UK government. Towering Newcastle defender Burn was always favourite to emerge victorious in an aerial challenge, given his height advantage, but Havertz was never going to give up the fight. He flung himself towards the ball, but led with his arm and kept an elbow raised when coming into contact with Burn. 🚨 ""It doesn't look great.""VAR controversy as Kai Havertz catches Dan Burn with an elbow. Just a yellow for the Chelsea man...👉 #CHENEW is live on Sky Sports Premier League pic.twitter.com/pyUJbGQMkM Having caught Burn with the point of his arm, leaving the Magpies’ January signing requiring treatment and sporting a nasty bump, a yellow card was flashed in Havertz’s direction by match referee David Coote. There was a VAR review as Newcastle players called for harsher punishment, but the on-field call stood. That is because video technology did not consider a clear and obvious error to have been made, leaving Havertz free to remain on the field. Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher was on co-commentary duty for Sky Sports at the time of the incident and said: “You look at Havertz's arm there. It doesn't look great. Yellow card is probably right. “It's similar to the Sadio Mane one against Cesar Azpilicueta. It fits into that category of a little more than a yellow and not quite a red.” Another former Reds star, Jamie Redknapp, said during the half-time break: “I think it’s a very dangerous challenge by Havertz. “You have to use your arms for elevation [but] his elbow is high and he catches him on the side of his face. He could have fractured his cheekbone.” Ex-Chelsea frontman Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink agreed with Redknapp, saying Havertz had been a bit “naughty”, but former Manchester City defender Micah Richards was of the opinion that the Chelsea frontman meant no harm and had not gone out of his way to tag Burn.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-kai-havertz-not-sent-off-elbow-dan-burn-chelsea/blt788f71d3d34e3fad,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2783,Watch: Australia's Redmayne dances Socceroos to 2022 World Cup with comical shoot-out mind games vs Peru,"Australia goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne made a decisive but comical intervention as his side secured a spot in the 2022 World Cup. The 33-year-old came off the bench at the end of extra-time in the AFC-CONMEBOL qualifying play-off clash as the match headed into penalties. The shoot-out went into sudden death as the two teams were level after five penalties each and Redmayne seized the opportunity to be the hero for the Socceroos. Not only did Redmayne make the vital stop in the shootout, he did so in a bizarre manner. The Sydney FC star did a comical dance to distract Alex Valera as he stepped up to take the penalty. His antics seemed to work as he ended up saving the effort. 🇦🇺 Andrew Redmayne nous a régalé sur sa ligne ce soir ! 🕺🕺🕺 pic.twitter.com/IDC1PckEyj THE DANCING WORKED 🕺😂Redmayne saves the penalty to send Australia to the 2022 FIFA World Cup!pic.twitter.com/7UHEYltCZi 𝑻𝒉𝒆𝒚'𝒓𝒆 𝒈𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒕𝒐 𝑸𝒂𝒕𝒂𝒓 🏆 The moment @Socceroos qualified for the #FIFAWorldCup! 🇦🇺 pic.twitter.com/XTJ3fib9Yd Monday's save was not the first time Redmayne has put on a dance before a vital penalty stop.

3733,'Miracles happen at Liverpool' - Reds legend Thompson believes Klopp's side can win quadruple,"For Phil Thompson, the comparisons are obvious. “It’s 2001 all over again, isn’t it?” the Liverpool legend tells GOAL, unable to conceal a smile. “I’m amazed more hasn’t been made of that, actually.” He’s got a point. Just as they did 21 years ago, the Reds stand on the brink of history, gunning for glory on multiple fronts and close to giving their supporters the season they always dreamed of.  Thompson was the assistant manager to Gerard Houllier in 2001, when a treble of League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup was secured, and then followed up with qualification for the Champions League on the final day of the season.  Unprecedented, they called it. Liverpool played every game they could possibly play that season, 63 of them in total. If everything goes their way during the next eight weeks, Jurgen Klopp’s quadruple-chasers will reach the same figure.  Do they even dare to dream about getting everything they’ve ever wanted? Thompson, one of the most decorated players in the club’s history and a European Cup-winning captain in 1981, says they should.  “Look, it’ll take a miraculous effort,” he says, eyes widening. “But if a miracle is going to happen, it will happen to Liverpool Football Club. That is the magic kingdom, when it comes to this sport. “So, I look and say yes, it’s a tall order, but we can do it.” Liverpool's quadruple dream is alive and kicking 🥥 pic.twitter.com/0k622OvWla Klopp and his players, of course, would wince at such comments.  Theirs is the ‘each game as it comes’ mantra, and it is one that has stood them in good stead to this point. While the world talks and the world dreams, Liverpool simply go to work. Thompson admires that, and he remembers the mentality of that 2001 run-in, when every fixture felt decisive.  Houllier’s side played eight games in April and six in May that year. Klopp’s team could face an even more arduous schedule. “I look at the fixtures for April and it’s like ‘wow!’” smiles Thompson, and just for a moment he is assistant manager again, giving a rousing speech to his players in the dressing room. “Don’t fear it, enjoy it!” he says. “Go and take it. This is what you play football for. Big match, big match, big match.  “Take it one at a time, chalk each one off, and, at the end of it all, you could have everything you’ve ever wanted. How good does that sound?” As a player, Thompson won it all, including seven league titles and a pair of European Cups. Later, he was reserve team coach under Kenny Dalglish, leaving after a fall-out with his successor, Graeme Souness.  His return to the club as No.2 to Houllier coincided with Liverpool’s return to prominence. The 2001 League Cup, for example, was their first piece of silverware in six years, and the UEFA Cup which followed was their first European trophy in 17.  Klopp has spoken previously about the weight of history at Anfield, and how that history should be embraced not feared. His players, he says, must write their own chapters, not compare themselves to the great sides of the past. Thompson can relate. “When I was there with Gerard, I can remember him saying similar things,” he says. “I would say it too. I’d tell the players ‘Make yourself legends’.  “Gerard used to have a big thing about ex-players who had won everything, and were now criticising in the media. He’d tell the players to go out and prove them wrong, show them that they belonged.  “Make yourselves legends, make yourselves heroes. And the only way to do that is by winning, and winning consistently.” He returns to the present team, and the challenges to come. “I look at this squad, and it’s so well-equipped,” he says. “Touch wood, we don’t get too many injuries, but even if we do, look at the bench now.  “It’s full of game-changers, players who can make the difference. In the last few months, we’ve had top players not even making the bench. That will stand us in good stead. “The focus is there, the quality is there, and they will get the greatest support in the world, every step of the way.” He’s on a roll now, finishing with a message for Klopp and his team. “This is their chance,” he says “Don’t shy away from it, thrive on it.  “Make sure it’s your pictures that are up on the wall alongside Dalglish, [Alan] Hansen, [Roger] Hunt, Souness. Make sure they have to keep changing the trophy count on that Champions Wall at the training ground. “Make yourselves legends.” The Boot Room Boys, the latest from the award-winning BT Sport Films series, will premiere on BT Sport 3 at 10.30pm on 5 April and will be available via the BT Sport App any time thereafter.

2608,"Athletic Club vs Barcelona: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Barcelona travel to the San Mames on Thursday evening to face Athletic Club in the last 16 of the Copa dDel Rey. Both sides were involved in the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia last week with Barcelona losing in the semi-final to Real Madrid and Athletic defeated by Los Blancos in the final. Athletic and Barca boast a proud tradition in this competition, with the Blaugrana the only side in Spain to have won the Copa del Rey more times than the team from Bilbao. This will be the fifth meeting between these two sides in the last 12 months and, during that time, Athletic have claimed one victory and Barcelona two wins, with the most recent meeting in August ending as a draw. The hosts are offered at 5/2 (3.50) with bet365 while the Catalans can be backed at 6/5 (2.20) and the draw at 11/5 (3.20). Ansu Fati could be fit enough to start his first game for Barcelona since November 6 and the teenager is priced at 13/2 (7.50) to open the scoring. Memphis Depay leads the market at 9/2 (5.50) with Ferran Torres offered at 11/2 (6.50). The shortest priced Athletic player to score first is Inaki Williams at 6/1 (7.00) with Raul Garcia available at 7/1 (8.00). Barcelona left Saudi Arabia following their 3-2 extra-time defeat with their heads held high after a performance that gave cause for optimism. Despite a fifth consecutive Clasico defeat, Barca showed plenty of spirit and purpose and, with important players coming back into the side, the second half of the season should see an improvement from the Blaugrana. Xavi Hernandez's side, however, are still conceding too many goals, and their record of one clean sheet in their last 10 matches underlines the ease with which opponents have been able to score against the Catalans. Athletic, meanwhile, remain a side who fail to take their chances, boasting one of the highest expected goals tallies in La Liga but one of the division's lowest goals per game ratio. Marcelino Garcia's men are likely to be competitive, as they always are in front of their own fans, but Barca's superior firepower should see them through. Barca can be backed at 6/5 (2.20) and that looks like a strong bet, while backing them at 9/10 (1.90) with a -0.25 Asian handicap could also appeal. Odds correct at the time of writing. 18+.

3728,Ronaldo looking his age as Man Utd struggle for goals ,"With 86 minutes on the clock on Saturday afternoon, Manchester United were piling forward into Watford’s box looking for a late winner only for Cristiano Ronaldo to be dispossessed.  It wasn’t the first time it had happened to the 37-year-old across the 90 minutes at Old Trafford but he appeared fed up. He looked up to the skies in exasperation and the visitors cleared again.  Frustrated reactions are at risk of becoming as synonymous with Ronaldo’s Man Utd performances as his famous ‘Siuuu’ celebrations.  And those frustrated reactions have certainly been coming more regularly than the celebrations in recent weeks. Ronaldo has managed just one goal in all competitions this calendar year.  For so long everyone had been used to seeing Ronaldo playing like a man a decade younger. Against Watford it looked like age was finally catching up with him.  But is it all his fault? This was his fourth game in 12 days and you could tell. He was slow and sloppy and the longer the game went on the more frustrated he became.  When he saw a shot on the hour mark rebound off Anthony Elanga he put his hand on the post and looked at the floor in disbelief.  “That was not the only [chance]. In the first half we had five massive chances then in the second half we had another three or four. Today we had enough chances to win that game,” United manager Ralf Rangnick said at full-time after a 0-0 draw with Roy Hodgson's side.  ""Sometimes we were unlucky, when we hit the post, but we also had a few opportunities one-on-one with the goalkeeper. This is not luck, it is a question of sharpness and efficiency in front of goal."" If Ronaldo is ultimately dropped then question marks still remain over who Rangnick could replace him with.  The manager said he had dropped Jadon Sancho, Harry Maguire, Marcus Rashford and Luke Shaw to the bench for this Premier League clash due to the number of games they’ve played recently. But here is the oldest player in the squad starting his fifth game in 14 days.  The current situation with Edinson Cavani is making things even more difficult.  The Uruguayan decides himself when he is fit enough to play and he has not been available for selection for the last four league games. And when he doesn’t fancy it, Ronaldo is the one tasked with leading the line.  He is the player who has been caught offside most in the league this season because his pace is not what it used to be. But that desperation to get in behind is somewhat understandable with the pressures being placed on the Portugal captain to deliver.  United’s draw against Watford was not Ronaldo’s fault. He contributed to the problems but the blame cannot be placed solely at his door.  Bruno Fernandes, Elanga and Paul Pogba all had opportunities that went astray; United had 22 shots but only three of those were on target and Rangnick has rightly placed the blame on the players rather than the coaching staff. ""Our job as coaches and head coaches is to help the team create enough chances,"" Rangnick said. ""If we only had two or three opportunities in the game, we could ask ourselves what we can do to create more, but the number of clear chances we had today have to be enough to win a game like this."" Ronaldo would have agreed with his manager. When the final whistle went he threw his arms up in disbelief and headed down the tunnel. A goalless draw at home, to a side who have only kept two clean sheets all season and sit in the relegation zone, was not what the five-time Ballon D’or winner came back to Manchester for.  He thought he would be able to get United back into a title battle and instead they have a tough task battling to finish in the top four.  With games against Manchester City, Tottenham and Liverpool coming up in the next few weeks they could find themselves battling to stay in the Europa League places let alone the Champions League spots.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-looking-his-age-as-man-utd-struggle-for-goals/blt751e0e617b30f575,Charlotte Duncker,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

494,Brilliant Bernardo taking the fight to biggest rivals for Pep's Man City bullies,"On an almost perfect return to his home city, perhaps the only thing that went wrong for Bernardo Silva on Tuesday was that he was denied a first ever Manchester City hat-trick. The Portugal midfielder could not have dreamt that his trip back to Lisbon for City's last-16 Champions League clash with Sporting C.P. would go this well. And yet it should come as no shock, as Bernardo is showing that he is able to thrive more than most when faced with a rival, regardless of whether that is because of a personal grudge or one of the few teams who can match City in the Premier League. A mischievous smile could be seen on the 27-year-old's face as the former Benfica academy player lined up for the Champions League anthem at the home of his boyhood rivals. It was even broader 17 minutes later, as he celebrated in front of the home fans after his thumping half-volley crashed down off the underside of the crossbar to give City a 2-0 lead. 💥 Bernardo Silva 💥He's slammed the ball home right on the half-volley!

The boos and whistles that had tried to intimidate Bernardo and three of his fellow ex-Benfica team-mates - Ederson, Ruben Dias and Joao Cancelo - had long been silenced. He gave a wave to the crowd when he headed in for half-time, with the home fans' only enjoyment coming early in the second period when Bernardo's header that would have earned him the match ball was ruled out for offside by VAR. That was, though, a short relief, as Pep Guardiola’s side continued their dominance with the ruthless control that has seen them take charge of the Premier League title race. ""Was I very offside? It would have been great to score a hat-trick but I'm happy with two goals,” Bernardo told BT Sport at full-time. ""I am Portuguese and I'm from the other side of the city, so it was special to score here in my home town.” For Guardiola it underlines that his team can now go anywhere in the world and play on the front foot, with players like Bernardo possessing the courage to take the fight to any opponent. Skilful, quick-thinking, tactically and technically brilliant, Bernardo also has the battling instincts to back up his talent. He showed it earlier in the season, when he dazzled at Anfield on his first return to the ground with spectators since a social media row with some Liverpool fans. Back at the Estadio Jose Alvalade, he sparkled again. Driving past Sporting defenders with ease, linking up with Kevin De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling to pass their opponents off the pitch and taking his chances when they came. ""Always I push him to score more goals,"" Guardiola said. ""Not talking about how good he is, he has everything. He has the ability to score more goals. Today in his city, from the rivals Benfica, I'm sure he's happy."" Bernardo was not the only one ex-Benfica player having fun on the night, either. Ruben Dias seemed to demand the ball at every opportunity in the opening minutes to attract even more jeers; Ederson pulled off an outrageous drawback and no-look pass to flummox a pressing Paulinho; and Joao Cancelo did the same with an audacious dummy. And they had every right to enjoy themselves. Riyad Mahrez’s opener, given after a long VAR check, and a Phil Foden goal either side of Bernardo’s strikes saw City become the first away team to have a four-goal half-time lead in the knockout stages of the Champions League. Raheem Sterling then scored a brilliant fifth to join the top-10 list of all-time City’s scorers with 127 in all competitons. But the night belonged to Bernardo. Sporting fans hurled their insults when he was substituted late in the game, but they must fear what he might do at the Etihad Stadium in the second leg next month. It seems almost unnecessary to play the game after such a one-sided affair, and with both sides concentrating on domestic title challenges. Guardiola may well, therefore, rotate his side for the rematch, but Bernardo will no doubt want to play and embarrass Sporting all over again.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bernardo-fight-rivals-pep-man-city-bullies/bltfa4a004703f13288,Jonathan Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10248,Top of the League at Christmas: Does It Mean Anything?,"It’s a battle of the summit of the Premier League this season, but what does it mean for the side who will be top of the league at Christmas? Here’s the ultimate guide to whether it’s a festive treat to be the top-flight leaders come Christmas Day. Arsenal will spend Christmas Day 2023 top of the Premier League table after their 1-1 draw with Liverpool on 23 December. Prior to 2023-23, there have been 124 English top-flight football seasons. And a quick check of the calendars for each of those years states there have been 124 different Christmas Days. It’s a somewhat arbitrary point of the season as it often fails to signify the halfway stage of a campaign. Yet for some – and for the purpose of this article – it is a definitive moment to look back, historically, at the state of the league table and what it meant in terms of those who went on to win the title and those that didn’t. Champions of Christmas? Maybe, but what does it mean when it comes to being champions overall? In the 124 previous English top-flight football seasons, the side at the top of the table on Christmas Day has gone on to win the title on 56 occasions, or around 45% of the time. In football’s early days, it had looked as though being top at Christmas would be an important part of any championship success, with Preston North End twice converting their leadership into silverware in 1888-89 and 1889-90. But as Notts County and Bolton Wanderers proved in the following seasons, that’s no easy task, as they both ended third after being top at Christmas. It’s Liverpool who have found themselves at the summit on 25 December the most times (20) in English top-flight history, although they are closely followed by Manchester United (18) – they are the only two sides to have reached double digits in this category. They may have last done so in 1969 but Everton have achieved this feat on nine different occasions, level with Arsenal, who spend last Christmas Day top of the Premier League and will do so again this season following their point at Anfield on Saturday evening. The Everton side of 1931-32 (insert obligatory Dixie Dean reference here) also jointly hold the record for the most goals scored by Christmas Day (73) for a team top of the table, alongside the Spurs team of 1960-61 (insert much less obligatory but equally valid Bobby Jones reference). And the following season, Burnley proved that conceding goals wasn’t to be a deterrent to rising to the summit, shipping a record 41 goals. That made the joint low recorded by Chelsea in 2005 and Liverpool in 2018 (seven) appear somewhat eyewatering. The overall odds of league success do slightly change if we are to look back over just the Premier League years. Norwich City might have been the first team to hold the record of being the competition’s leaders on 25 December, but an even quicker flick through the memory bank and you’ll know that we don’t celebrate Mike Walker, Jeremy Goss and Bryan Gunn in quite the same fashion as Alex Ferguson, Ryan Giggs and Peter Schmeichel. However, there have been 16 occasions when the Premier League leaders on 25 December have gone on to be crowned champions (51.6%). This has included two occasions where it happened for four consecutive seasons (between 2009-10 and 2012-13 as well as between 2014-15 and 2017-18) and a separate run of three between 2004-05 and 2006-07. Man Utd and Chelsea both hold the honour of having gone on to win the Premier League title the most times having been top on Christmas Day, doing so on five occasions each. That means that every time Chelsea have been crowned Premier League champions, it has followed them topping the table at Christmas. Sadly, this isn’t true across their top-flight history with their triumph in the 1954-55 season seeing Wolverhampton Wanderers ahead at the summit on goal difference. Manchester United also hold the record for being top of the table on the most occasions in Premier League history on Christmas Day, having done so seven different times, with Liverpool (six) their closest challengers. It took Liverpool until their fifth attempt to go on and win the Premier League title, but spare a thought for Arsenal who have celebrated their feast of turkey and all the trimmings at the Premier League summit on three different occasions without going on to win the overall prize (it seems a hungry Arsenal is a dangerous Arsenal when it comes to hunting down Premier League titles). Going back further, Arsenal have failed to win the league on the last five occasions that they have led the top-flight table on Xmas Day, before 2023. The last time that the Gunners won the league after also leading at Christmas was in 1947-48. The side who held the biggest advantage on Christmas Day and then went on to claim the title were Manchester City in the 2017-18 season, turning their 13-point advantage at the summit into Pep Guardiola’s first title in England in a record-setting season. They broke numerous records, including most points (100), most wins (32), most goals (106) and highest goal difference (+79) as they’d eventually secure a 19-point advantage come the end of the campaign. Their pre-Christmas feats also saw them surpass the previous best effort of rivals Manchester United in the 1993-94 season, when they held on to a 12-point lead at the top. When it comes to the biggest advantage not turned into a triumph, it looked as though Newcastle United’s 69-year wait for a top-flight title was going to end as the 1995-96 side took a 10-point advantage into Christmas. However, they would meet their biggest title rivals on 27 December 1995, with Manchester United carving out a 2-0 victory to cut the gap down. Kevin Keegan’s side would bounce back to re-establish a 12-point advantage before “mind games” and Anfield capitulations would hand Alex Ferguson another crown and Sky Sports viewers one of the most memorable post-match interviews of all time. At least Newcastle could console themselves with finishing second. Aston Villa fans were probably making Christmas wishes that their 1998-99 team could turn their place at the summit into gold the following May. Instead, defeat against Blackburn Rovers would be the start of a terrible run of form that saw John Gregory’s side win two games in 14 to slide down the table into sixth, the biggest drop in league position for any Premier League Christmas leader. But that’s not the overall record when it comes to the biggest droppers. Three sides have ended the season in eighth having topped the top-flight table at Christmas. It probably won’t surprise you – just because they have been top so many times – that Manchester United (1971-72) and Liverpool (1949-50) have both done it, as well as Sunderland (1936-37), the fifth and final occasion they had found themselves at the summit on 25 December. 1992: Norwich City finished 3rd1993: Manchester United finished 1st1994: Blackburn Rovers finished 1st1995: Newcastle United finished 2nd1996: Liverpool finished 4th1997: Manchester United finished 2nd1998: Aston Villa finished 6th1999: Leeds United finished 3rd2000: Manchester United finished 1st2001: Newcastle United finished 4th2002: Arsenal finished 2nd2003: Manchester United finished 3rd2004: Chelsea finished 1st2005: Chelsea finished 1st2006: Manchester United finished 1st2007: Arsenal finished 3rd2008: Liverpool finished 2nd2009: Chelsea finished 1st2010: Manchester United finished 1st2011: Manchester City finished 1st2012: Manchester United finished 1st2013: Liverpool finished 2nd2014: Chelsea finished 1st2015: Leicester City finished 1st2016: Chelsea finished 1st2017: Manchester City finished 1st2018: Liverpool finished 2nd2019: Liverpool finished 1st2020: Liverpool finished 3rd2021: Manchester City finished 1st2022: Arsenal finished 2nd2023: Arsenal finished…?

9198,Chris Sutton claims Harry Kane might be jealous of Tottenham's season under Ange Postecoglou,"Chris Sutton suggests that Harry Kane might be feeling a twinge of 'jealousy' as he observes Tottenham's season under Ange Postecoglou, especially with Bayern Munich's recent struggles. Bayern faced a surprising 1-0 home defeat against Werder Bremen on Sunday, putting them seven points behind the league leaders Bayer Leverkusen. This setback raises concerns about Kane's chances of securing silverware in his inaugural season with Munich.During Mail Sport's podcast ""It's All Kicking Off,"" Ian Ladyman, Sutton's co-host, mentioned Bayern's recent struggles and playfully suggested that Harry should 'come home.'He said: ""Bayern Munich lost again this weekend. Lost at home to Werder Bremen. Seven points behind Leverkusen now. Harry, you've got to come home mate.""""Harry, you're out of the German Cup. You've got to come home. You're not going to get your medal at Bayern. You've got to come home. Come back to Tottenham, mate.""Sutton expressed that Kane might glance back at his old team, presently in fifth place and only three points away from the top four, and feel a sense of 'jealousy' as he observes their appealing passing style of play.""Listen, I'm going to stand by what I said. I think Harry will be looking at what's gone on at Spurs, watching their brand of football. I think there's a bit of jealousy there.""Ladyman then said: ""I was the one at the start of the season who said he'd made a mistake going to Bayern and should have stayed at Tottenham and you ridiculed me for that.""'Deserved defeat': Thomas Tuchel rips into his Bayern Munich players in fiery interview",https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-01-23-chris-sutton-claims-harry-kane-might-be-jealous-of-tottenhams-season-under-ange-postecogl/,Andrii Sokolovskyi,2024-01-23T12:58:04.000Z,Daily Mail
1907,"Villarreal 'know how to suffer' and will not be intimidated by Liverpool, insists Moreno","Villarreal will have an advantage when they face Liverpool in Wednesday's Champions League semi-final, says former Reds defender Alberto Moreno, because they know how ""to suffer"" against bigger opposition in the long game. The Yellow Submarine have turned last season's Europa League triumph in a remarkable run to the last four this term, knocking out both Juventus and Bayern Munich to set up a clash with Jurgen Klopp's Reds. Despite their success however, they enter as major underdogs - but Moreno believes they can thrive under the pressure as they know how to play when the going gets tough. ""Suffer,"" Moreno stated when asked how the Yellow Submarine would perform. ""We are going to suffer. But if you want to win against these teams you have to suffer. You're not going to beat one of these teams face-to-face, it's impossible. ""You have to suffer and we know how to suffer. Villarreal has a virtue, that we all know how to suffer together as a team, but then we also know how to play ball because there are players in this squad of spectacular quality. ""That explains the way we are doing. Because when we have to suffer against big teams, we suffer. And we know how to do it. And then with the ball the big teams suffer against us. They are aware of that."" Villarreal head to Merseyside in the first leg looking to mount a surprise advantage away from home soil, and Moreno adds that he considers the ground more hostile to visit than Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu - but says the Yellow Submarine have an advantage. ""For me personally, yes,"" he stated. ""I don't want any conflict or anything! But many of Villarreal's players have already played at Anfield and they know what it's like. ""It is a point in our favor. We already know what that is and that we must try not to listen to anything.

10914,Eze Does It: Crystal Palace Star Completes Long Road Back to England Squad,"In 2021, Eberechi Eze suffered a serious Achilles injury on the day he was included in a provisional England squad. Now he’s back and could make his Three Lions debut on Friday. Tuesday, 18 May, 2021 was anything but a normal day at Crystal Palace’s Beckenham training ground. Roy Hodgson announced he was to leave his post at the end of the 2021-22 season, ushering in a new era, and it was also a momentous day for Eberechi Eze. The talented attacking midfielder was approaching the end of a very promising first season at Selhurst Park having joined from QPR in August 2020. He was among the first-team players preparing for what had just been confirmed as Hodgson’s final home match, with Arsenal set to visit on the Wednesday. Inside, unbeknownst to Eze at the time, a message had been sent to his phone. It was joyous news; he’d been called up to the senior England squad for the first time, included in the provisional 30-man selection ahead of the delayed Euro 2020. But there was a gutting twist of fate. Eze didn’t see the message until he asked Palace’s Player Liaison Officer to fetch his phone so he could let his parents know he’d suffered a serious injury. “I’d just received the ball and went to push off and it felt like someone had kicked me as hard as they could in the back of my Achilles,” he told Palace’s website a few months later. “I looked around and no one’s there, so I’m like: ‘Yeah, I know this is bad.’” Eze didn’t play again in the Premier League until late November, and Palace were careful about getting him back up to speed, so he only managed one more top-flight appearance before the end of 2021. Then, by the conclusion of the 2021-22 season, just six of his 13 league outings had been as a starter. Now, however, he’s back in the England setup. No “provisional” squad this time, the real deal. A debut potentially awaits against Malta on Friday, and given his journey to this point, the occasion will be sweeter for him than anyone else. By Eze’s own admission, he was in tears before he’d even made his way back inside after suffering the injury. That made Hodgson’s suggestion Palace would “assess” him ahead of the Arsenal game look a little optimistic. Perhaps Hodgson was a little caught up in the furore of his own announcement? We can forgive him a moment of self-indulgence. But the reality was a long road back began that day for Eze, and in terms of his England career, it was no means a guarantee he’d ever return to the path he was on. There was always the possibility of other younger – potentially even more talented – players emerging while he was simply trying to rehabilitate. It’s also worth remembering, an Achilles rupture can be a career-ending injury for an athlete. Then-teammate Andros Townsend was fully aware of the severity, later reflecting on it being the “one of the saddest days of my career” due to the combination of his friend’s agony and Hodgson’s impending exit. Hodgson was convinced it was an obstacle Eze – who is also eligible to represent Nigeria – would overcome, however, saying a few days later: “One is then concerned that is going to have a catastrophic effect on the player himself. [But] I’ve been very impressed by his resilience and mental approach. He will recover and will recover faster than is normally possible to recover. In the meantime, he’s going to have to accept that these tests of his mental capacity are part and parcel of football. He’s learnt so early on and he has a bright future, this young man. He will get over it.” He wasn’t wrong, but Eze’s still had to overcome challenges and difficulty. Quite recently, actually. He did go on to play in every one of Palace’s 38 Premier League games in 2022-23, but he lost his place in the starting XI in mid-January and spent most of the following two months coming off the bench. In Patrick Vieira’s final 10 league matches in charge, Eze played more than 45 minutes just twice. When you consider most would identify the 24-year-old as one of Palace’s most talented players and that the team were being steadily sucked into a relegation battle, Vieira’s ostracisation of Eze looked puzzling from the outside. They won none of those 10 games. When Eze did play under Vieira this season, he was often urged to operate towards the left. The graphic below shows where his touches of the ball took place on the pitch this season under the Frenchman and then after Hodgson’s return. The difference is stark. Hodgson has deployed him more centrally, but generally the change in manager led to an improvement in the squad’s mood. There’s a greater sense of freedom, whereas Vieira was considered to be fairly strict. “I think [Hodgson] has just given us the confidence in what we’re good at,” Eze said in April. “We know what we can do. We know what we’re capable of, and he’s given us the licence to go and do that. We’re playing with a lot more freedom, more energy, and we’re so much more positive, which is a huge credit to the gaffer coming in and helping us with that.” It’s fair to say one of the most notable results of Palace’s changes has been Eze’s form. Had Vieira remained in charge for the rest of the season, the chances of Eze breaking into the England squad would’ve been remote. But it’s not even an exaggeration to say he arguably finished the season as one of the Premier League’s form players. Having scored just four times in 27 top-flight games under Vieira this term, he netted six in 10 as Hodgson comfortably guided the Eagles to safety. Only five players scored more over the same period. Hodgson using Eze in a more central role didn’t make him significantly more involved on a base level – his touches per 90 minutes only increased slightly from 57.5 to 58.9. But his touches in the opposition’s box nearly doubled (2.5 to 4.8), and as such Palace enjoyed more tangible results from him having the ball, hence Eze’s expected goals (xG) increasing over the two periods from 3.25 (27 games) to 3.96 (10 games). Eze finished the season with 10 goals in total. Those translated to 11 points won, a figure only six players could better, and more than half of his output in this metric came in the final 10 games of the campaign. He netted both goals in each of the 2-0 wins over Southampton and Bournemouth; he also converted the penalty that was the difference in the 4-3 defeat of West Ham. The goals he’s scored have shown a real variety, too. There were delicate back-post headers against Wolves and Brentford; a poacher’s finish under pressure in the 5-1 demolition of Leeds; a first-time left-footed sweep into the far side of the net against Bournemouth to cap off a 25-pass move, which was the third-longest goal-ending sequence in the Premier League this season. But it was his other goal against Bournemouth, his second at Southampton, and his effort at home to Leeds way back in October that showcased the kind of quality that sets Eze apart and will hopefully be on display for England soon. For each of those goals in question Eze’s balance and confidence on the ball shone through, either shrugging off or dribbling past at least one defender. His two goals directly following a take-on was bettered only by Miguel Almirón this season, while no one could match his 73 successful dribbles past an opponent. In fact, Eze’s technical brilliance as a dribbler is probably best evidenced by the fact Martin Ødegaard was the sole player of the 49 to attempt at least 70 dribbles and record a better success rate, though the difference was negligible (63.0% to 62.9%). Simply put, Eze’s an elegant, aesthetically pleasing footballer. Confident carrying the ball and brave enough to test defenders in decisive areas, he brings genuine quality to the England setup. It could be argued that consistency has eluded him to this point, and that should be one of his next areas of focus now Hodgson has seemingly identified to everyone where he’s best utilised. But for now, Eze has every right to sit back and reflect on a testing journey from rock-bottom back to square one: England duty.

10406,The Definitive Guide to Dribblers,"Have you ever wondered about the data behind dribbling? Of course you have, and now you’re in luck because we’ve delved into the stats from the past 10 seasons to provide you with the definitive guide to dribblers. Dribbling; perhaps the purest form of football artistry and one of the chief identifiers of technical prowess, it’s been the trump card of many of the sport’s all-time greats. It’s a skill as old as the game itself and yet still rarely fails to get bums off seats and fans shouting “olé!”, “wheey!”, or whatever emotive, short-syllabled colloquialism that conveys amusement in your language. But in this age of unprecedented football data comprehension and stats consumption, it’s probably an area that gets overlooked in favour of goals, assists, expected goals, and so on. Well, goals, assists, expected goals, and so on, are overrated [editor’s disclaimer: Opta does not endorse the views of this writer] – sometimes all you really need to watch is a majestic pint-sized Argentinian dance their way past three defenders, even if they end up just passing it 40 yards back to the goalkeeper. As admirers of dribbling and dribblers, we thought it would be fun/interesting/a means to justify our existence if we waded into the seemingly less-explored realm of dribbling and take-on data from the past 10 seasons (so, excluding 2023-24) across Europe’s big five leagues and considered what questions the numbers can answer. Why the past 10 seasons? Firstly, why not? Secondly, we needed a timeframe. And thirdly, it’s a nice round number. So, grab a napkin: it’s time for some dribbling. Okay, let’s get this out of the way now: expect quite a few references to Lionel Messi in this article. No, we aren’t a part of his so-called “PR machine”, it just turns out he’s been a fairly ludicrous footballer in his career and dribbling proved to be a pretty major weapon in his arsenal. Who knew? So, with that addressed, we can reveal that Cristiano Ron… Just kidding. Obviously Messi topped the charts for the most take-ons over the period of August 2012 until June 2023 in Europe’s big five leagues with 2,586. That’s 505 more than any other player over the same period. Of course, he benefits from being old enough to have featured prominently in each of the 10 seasons in our study, but that’s just the way this particular cookie crumbles. Now, try to guess who’s second to Messi… And if you’ve skimmed ahead then you’re disqualified… The answer is Wilfried Zaha. The Ivory Coast winger, who was at Crystal Palace before joining Galatasaray in the summer, is the only other player to attempt 2,000 or more take-ons over the period in question, with his total at 2,081. Closing out the top five are Neymar (1,987), Eden Hazard (1,582) and Raheem Sterling (1,522), though it’s fair to say the former two would’ve tallied far more had they not endured a lot of injury problems over the past few years. Attempting to take a player on and succeeding are entirely different things, however – even your gran can try. But now we want to know who’s registered the most successful take-ons. Well, given he’s attempted loads more than anyone else, it’s not going to be a huge surprise to see Messi at the top of the leaderboard again here with 1,509 completed take-ons – he’s actually the only player to break the 1,000 mark. Hazard retired recently after a miserable few years, and considering the incredible talent he was, the fact he sits one shy of 1,000 delivers a pang of sadness – but then again, this 10-year period is fairly arbitrary, so he probably won’t lose any sleep over it. Of course, as already mentioned, players who’ve featured in the qualifying leagues for the entire 10-season period are at an advantage, so we can level the playing field somewhat by looking at the data on a per-90-minute basis (minimum 100 dribbles, 1,000+ minutes played). Messi does still rank pretty high with 4.1 successful take-ons every 90 minutes, but he is just outside the top 10 (13th). Adama Traoré is top of the pile here, with 6.1 completed take-ons per 90; the other particularly high-volume dribblers filling out the top five are Jérémy Doku (5.4), who is currently dazzling at Manchester City, Sofiane Boufal (4.9), Allan Saint-Maximin (4.8) and Jérémie Boga (4.5). Tallying the most take-on attempts or the most successful take-ons is all well and good, but we also want to know which players had the highest completion rates as that can give us a better idea of a player’s reliability when trying to dribble past an opponent. Now, there’s several ways of approaching this. Obviously there were some players over the period we’re looking at who achieved a 100% success rate but from, say, nine take-ons spread over 10 seasons. Those aren’t really the players we want to focus on; we care about those for whom dribbling is at least a semi-important ability, or those whose playing styles encompass a reasonably high reliance on their twinkle toes. So, for our first round of results, we filtered out players who attempted fewer than two take-ons per 90 minutes and played under 4,500 minutes over our chosen period; that still left us with a sample size of 972 players, so there’s plenty to go off. In this group, former Tottenham and Belgium midfielder Mousa Dembélé boasted the leading take-on completion rate (78.1% – 406/520), perhaps unsurprising to anyone who witnessed his graceful ability on the ball in the Premier League. He was slightly ahead of former Paris Saint-Germain star Marco Verratti (77% – 421/547), but what makes the Belgian stand out a little more was that dribbling was arguably a more important – or more utilised – asset to him, as he attempted 3.2 take-ons per 90 compared to the Italian’s 2.2. But what’s clear from this group is the presence of central midfielders; they dominate the upper echelons of the leaderboard. PSG’s Lee Kang-in, ranked 23rd (66.5%), is arguably the first non-central midfielder, and even then he has been known to play in fairly central positions during his career. We get a greater positional variance in the data when increasing the attempted take-ons criteria to four per 90, and we start to see a few more names we might associate more closely with such artistry. Messi (58.4%), Nabil Fekir (58.6%), Hazard (63.2%) and Traoré (66%) all enter the top 20, though it’s still a couple of – admittedly attack-minded – midfielders who occupy first and second, with former Brazil international Diego (69.3%) ahead of Tanguy Ndombele (67.8%). Another way of looking at completion rate would be to simply focus on players who’ve been bona fide high-volume dribblers over several seasons; so for argument’s sake, those who’ve averaged at least six take-on attempts per 90 and played 6,500 minutes or more. This now starts to look like a list of names you’d expect to see, with Traoré, Messi and Allan Saint-Maximin in first, second and third respectively. The table below then covers a broader spectrum of players and their dribbling habits, allowing you to sort by your desired metric. Just as dribbling can be great fun to watch, many players obviously get a kick out of it too – and we don’t mean in terms of rough treatment from defenders. Then there are the players who seem to only want to dribble. When delving into the data over the seasons we’re focusing on, finding out who registered the most take-ons in a single season felt like a must, and it chucked out a name we weren’t expecting, mostly because he disappeared from European football four years ago. Remember Yacine Brahimi? The former France youth star, who went on represent Algeria, was great fun to watch during his time in Europe and is the sort of player who has YouTube highlights reels as long as your arm. In the 2013-14 season, when playing for Granada in La Liga, he was determined to show his fancy footwork on a regular basis – he attempted 354 take-ons, which is not only the most in a single season over the last decade, it’s also the most by a player in one campaign on record across the top five leagues. Real Madrid’s Vinícius Júnior went close to surpassing Brahimi’s haul last season with 348; the only other players to break 300 in this period are Messi (335 – 2014-15), Neymar (318 – 2016-17), Karim Bellarabi (315 – 2014-15) and Zaha (308 – 2019-20). It’s almost like this person knew what we were working on this week. Who completed the most dribbles in a single game We’ve already spoken a little about take-ons per 90 minutes, and how Traoré’s average of 6.1 completed take-ons in a single season was very good for a high-volume dribbler. Hopefully that will provide some of the context that highlights just how mad some of the stats in this section will be. The answer to the title question may not be that surprising; it’s Vinícius. However, his figure of 27 take-on attempts in April’s 4-2 defeat to Girona is anything but expected, even for him.  That is four more take-on attempts registered in a single match than any other player over the 10 seasons we’re looking at, yet he only managed to succeed with eight of them. In fact, his 19 failed take-ons in one match is also a record over the period in question, with the next most being 14.  As for the question posed in the X post mentioned above, the most successful take-ons by a player in one match is 17; this was recorded by former Germany international Karim Bellarabi for Bayer Leverkusen against Werder Bremen in February 2015. This was during the aforementioned 2014-15 season when Bellarabi attempted 315 take-ons over the course of the campaign.  Those 17 successful take-ons were from a possible 23, giving him a very commendable 73.9% success rate for the match… His Leverkusen side still lost, though… For some, just enjoying a player’s ability to skilfully evade a defender isn’t enough; they need to see end product as well. Football is about goals after all, so it stands to reason. Thankfully, we can attribute value to a player’s dribbles and take-ons by looking at those that lead to a shot, a chance created, an assist or a goal. Spoiler alert, Messi tops all four categories. Now, this shouldn’t be much of a surprise by now. We’ve already highlighted how Messi has attempted more than anyone else, so he obviously has a greater data pool than everyone. A fairer way of looking at it might be to see what percentage of each player’s total take-ons led to a tangible end product; so, that’s what we did. Edinson Cavani boasted the best record over the period in question for proportion of take-ons (minimum 300) leading to a shot or chance created; 17.3% of his take-ons (53/306) led to one or the other. He was ahead of Carlos Bacca (56/369 – 15.2%), Jamie Vardy (75/498 – 15.1%) and Cristiano Ronaldo (145/977 – 14.8%), while Messi, on 11.1%, ranked as low as 33rd (287/2,586). This obviously isn’t to say a player only adds value to a team’s attack if they take a shot or create a chance. For instance, Messi might take on six players, pass to a teammate who then sets up another colleague to score – that’s still value, so we recognise the limitations here. However, in most cases, shots, chances created, goals and assists are at least a decent way to quantify efficiency to a degree. When we look at the greatest proportion of take-ons leading to goals or assists, the same player leads the way. Cavani is top with 4.9% (15/306) of his dribbles leading to a goal or an assist. Wissam Ben Yedder (3.9% – 22/570), Carlos Tevez (3.6% – 12/338), Bacca (3.5% – 13/369) and Vardy (3.4% – 17/498) close out the top five. Messi ranks 17th this time (2.5% – 65/2,586), but we feel it’s necessary to highlight how he shoots up to second when his numbers are considered in the context of other high-volume dribblers (minimum 900 take-on attempts), behind only Kylian Mbappé (2.7% – 31/1,147). Many of the world’s best domestic leagues have been associated with one stylistic aspect or another over time. For years, Italy was seen as the home of defensive football, the Premier League was deemed to be all about brute strength and physicality, La Liga possessed many of the world’s best technicians, and for a while the Bundesliga was strongly tied to high pressing. Perhaps some of these perceptions are a little less common or generalised these days as there’s an argument top-level European football has become stylistically homogenous. Either way, dribbling’s never had quite that same association with a specific league – at least not in modern times. A simple explanation could be what this piece has hopefully accentuated: it’s such a difficult skill to master and provide tangible results. As the table directly below shows, over the past 10 seasons in the top five European leagues, no competition has reached an average take-on success rate of 60% in a single campaign – and that’s despite us setting a fairly low bar with our filtering (players with a minimum of 10 take-on attempts in a season).  Over the course of those 10 seasons, the Premier League has the highest average success rate (52%), while La Liga (47%) has the lowest. But the overall averages have been steadily decreasing, as the graph highlights. The apparent decrease in take-on success rates in the past few years hasn’t seemingly coincided with a dramatic increase in players trying to beat their markers, however. The graph below suggests take-on attempts per match have pretty much flatlined and this highlights a particularly big swing in the Bundesliga; last season, Germany’s top flight saw 34.3 take-on attempts on per game on average, 25.6 fewer than in the 2013-14 season for instance.  It stands to reason that an increase in passing frequency is a contributing factor across the board. The 14 campaigns across the top five leagues in the past 10 seasons that averaged under 860 passes per game also averaged 38.8 take-ons each match. Whereas the 16 campaigns that averaged over 900 passes per game saw take-ons reduce to 35.8 each match. Similarly, the latter group of seasons were generally more recent, with only five of the 16 being 2018-19 or earlier.  So, although the Bundesliga (38.1) has averaged the most take-ons per game over our 10-season period, there’s been such a fluctuation that it would feel unfair to declare one league to be the home of dribbling. It all got a bit serious then, didn’t it? Well, let’s end on a more fun note as we look at the ultimate dribbling accomplishment: taking on several players before scoring.  Across the 10 seasons we’ve looked at, the most opponents any one player dribbled past before scoring was four, and it happened six times. But the instance we’re going to focus on is the one that combines the take-ons and goal with the longest ball carry. All hail Sofiane Boufal! The Moroccan winger scored an incredible goal for Southampton against West Brom in October 2017 that saw him take up possession in his own half, quickly evade two defenders and then charge into the Baggies’ half. The third successful take-on in this sequence resulted in two West Brom players comically crashing into each other, and then his fourth occurred just inside the penalty area before slotting home at the end of a 62.2-metre run. Boufal’s Southampton career may never have reached the heights hoped when he first joined, but we (dribbling aficionados) will always have that goal. And even if dribbling does continue to decrease, it’ll only make those rare flourishes even more special. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new football newsletter to receive exclusive weekly content.

4291,Which football players and managers own racehorses?,"Owning a racehorse is just part of the football lifestyle these days. With the 2022 edition of the Cheltenham Festival getting under way, GOAL decided to take a deeper look into some of the most notable names to get involved in racing. From Sir Alex Ferguson to Thomas Muller via Sergio Ramos and Antoine Griezmann, it turned up some interesting stories. Ferguson's part-ownership of Rock of Gibraltar, the 2002 European Horse of the Year, is probably the most famous - and notorious - example of racing and football mixing in the UK. The then-Manchester United manager claimed that in 2001 he was gifted a 50 per cent stake in the horse by John Magnier, who at the time was a major shareholder in the Red Devils along with his associate J.P. McManus. Fergie subsequently demanded that share of the horse's lucrative stud fees - the charge for the horse's service in breeding - only for Magnier to insist that they remain in the control of Coolmore Stud, the breeding operation he owns. It might not have been such a big deal had 'Rocky' not gone on to win seven Group 1 races after Ferguson and Magnier's supposed arrangement had been struck, meaning he was valued at around £200 million ($261m) when he went to stud. Eventually, Ferguson settled for £2.5m ($3m) - a deal which does not look particularly favourable for him in hindsight. The saga was a major problem for United, with Magnier and McManus turning against Ferguson in a series of concerns addressed at the club hierarchy and eventually selling to the unpopular Glazer family. There have been some big equestrianism fans to have graced the ranks at Real Madrid down the years, including Spain international full-back Alvaro Odriozola in the present. Ex-Blancos captain Sergio Ramos is perhaps the most notable, though, having opened the SR4 Stud Farm near Seville. He has entered some of the horses he has bred into competition. Former Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas - who is now a team-mate of Ramos at Paris Saint-Germain - also rode horses back in his home country of Costa Rica and continues to keep them at his family home. Here's a weird football fact you probably won't have heard before: Claudio Pizarro and Joey Barton co-owned a horse called Crying Lightning. How that came about, we have no idea. Pizarro apparently owns more than 50 racehorses in Argentina and likes a bet on American racing, though he was keen to stress to DW-World in Germany that he risks only small sums. Barton, meanwhile, has had a few horses that he likes to name after songs - My Propeller joins Crying Lightning in the Arctic Monkeys collection and there is also Hand In Glove (The Smiths). Michael Owen is perhaps the biggest recent footballer-turned-racing-aficionado there is, founding his own stable in Cheshire in 2006 and turning it into a Group 1-calibre facility for trainer Tom Dascombe. However, in 2022, it was confirmed that Hugo Palmer would be replacing Dascombe as trainer at Manor House Stables. Last time I was here, Brown Panther ruled in The Dubai Gold Cup on World Cup night. Tonight, Angel Alexander takes his first steps towards competing in The Al Quoz. #Meydan #Dubai pic.twitter.com/khSelVDT7q The former Liverpool striker's passion for the sport is undoubtedly genuine; he was caught in tears when Brown Panther won the King George V Stakes at Royal Ascot back in 2011. The horse's mother, Treble Heights, he explained, was one of the family. ""I raced the mother, I've got a few of the brothers at home,"" Owen enthused. ""She's a family pet and so are all the offspring. I've got four children and they all love the mother. We pat it most days and she's a lovely mare."" Interestingly, in 2017 Owen actually rode a horse, Calder Prince, at Ascot and finished second. He is not the only player from Liverpool's Spice Boys era to pursue the sport - Robbie Fowler and Steve McManaman also owned racehorses together. This is stretching the rules a bit - Muller and his wife Lisa, a semi-professional dressage rider, keep horses at their home in Germany, but for show rather than racing. Lisa competes in dressage competitions in Bavaria but the family also have a stake in higher-level competition - one show-jumping horse Muller co-owns, called Leonidas, has been ridden by Ludger Beerbaum, a German who has been ranked the top show jumper in the world on multiple occasions. Ex-Newcastle United striker Tino Asprilla is a lover of fine horses and owns several worth millions that live on his ranch in Colombia. We really wanted to include him on this list, however, because he once posted a video of someone - supposedly himself - teaching one of his horses to play football while riding it in a pink Tyrannosaurus Rex costume. Yes, you read that correctly. Enseñándole a mi caballo Firulai a jugad futbol. pic.twitter.com/OBN1trmzm0 If there is one man to top Owen's racing success, it is Mick Channon. Like Owen, he rose to fame initially by scoring goals, netting 21 for England in the 1970s and enough for Southampton to remain their all-time top scorer to this day. After retiring he took up his interest in racing, starting out as an assistant before getting his own licence and establishing himself as one of the top trainers in the sport. His reputation with horses probably now surpasses what he achieved on the pitch, which is no small feat. Channon has delivered millions of pounds in prize money and put up 71 winners in British flat races in 2016. In his most prolific year, 2003, he enjoyed 144 victories. Former West Ham and Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp saw a passion for racing sparked by his grandmother and owned some decent horses in his time, including smart sprinter Moviesta and useful hurdler Shakem Up'Arry. From the horse's mouthThe story of why Harry @Redknapp named his horse Shakem Up'Arry involving a @WestHam fan... 🐴⚽️ pic.twitter.com/mY3TrlhcHH Current Queens Park Rangers striker Charlie Austin is the founder of the Excel Racing syndicate and saw his first horse, Miss Sophierose, win a bumper on her debut at Worcester. Manchester United's all-time leading goalscorer, Wayne Rooney, has invested in a number of horses in the past - including one called Switcharooney - while Newcastle frontman Chris Wood is a self-confessed racing fanatic.

2219,Neymar blasts Fabio Aurelio for 'talking sh*t' after fellow Brazilian called out PSG for failing to win Ballon d'Or,"Neymar has blasted comments by former Valencia star and fellow Brazilian Fabio Aurelio over his failure to win the Ballon d'Or during his time at Paris Saint-Germain, stating that the latter is ""talking sh*t"". The Selecao striker broke transfer records when he swapped Barcelona for the Ligue 1 giants and has helped cement them as one of Europe's best sides since his move. A lack of both continental silverware and personal accolades during his time there remains elusive, but after comments by Aurelio suggested he should be disppointed in himself, the forward has fired back in a sweary response. “I’m tired of these ex-players who are there and only open their mouths to talk sh*t,"" Neymar said on an Instagram story. ""A five minute interview and all he did was talk about other people’s lives. ""If you want to criticise, criticise. But talking sh*t like that is not possible."" In a GOAL-excusive discussion, the former Liverpool star was critical of Neymar's wasted potential during his time at Paris Saint-Germain, that has seen him conquer domestic glory and little else. Save their 2020 Champions League final loss to Bayern Munich, the Ligue 1 giants have not come close to the kind of European success several of their rivals have, despite their financial outlay and top-tier roster of superstar names. “I always say that I would be very disappointed if I was him,"" Aurelio stated on the matter.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/neymar-blasts-fabio-aurelio-talking-shit-brazilian-psg/blt069017401a8db44a,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4359,Dike to West Brom: Why USMNT star's Premier League dreams must begin in the Championship,"Several months ago, Daryl Dike was the talk of American soccer. The 21-year-old striker was linked with a move to the Premier League, potentially to a club in the 'Big Six'. He had previously thrived in the Championship with Barnsley and was breaking through with the U.S. men's national team, fuelling the belief that he could someday thrive at the top levels of English soccer. But a lot has changed since then. The hype around Dike has died down as form, fatigue and the rise of Ricardo Pepi has seen him overshadowed by American soccer's latest darling. In the end, Dike got his permanent move to England, just not to a Big-Six club, or even one in the Premier League. Instead, Dike has made a £7 million ($9.5m) transfer to West Brom as he looks to recapture some of the hype that made him one of the most talked-about American stars of 2021. But the switch isn't just about generating hype. It's also about proving that he can be the USMNT's No.9 at this year's World Cup by leading West Brom back to the Premier League. ""It was an easy decision when I heard about the club's interest in me,"" Dike recently told ESPN. ""It's always been in my head to be over here in England. ""Growing up, I have always dreamed of playing here, especially at a club like this, with history, the manager and the opportunity to go up to the Premier League. There were so many different factors that made the decision a lot easier for me."" It's been just 11 months since Dike truly began his ascent, rapidly shifting from MLS rookie to potential star. Welcome to Albion, @DarylDike. 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/HRHNXWTYaF After completing an injury-riddled debut season with Orlando City, Dike was loaned to Barnsley in the English Championship, putting him in the shop window in one of the biggest shops around. And Dike thrived, netting nine goals in 19 league games, instantly becoming one of the hottest prospects around.  Links to clubs like Manchester United and Liverpool rolled in. Comparisons to Romelu Lukaku and Didier Drogba began to pop up. He brought those links and those comparisons back with him to MLS when his loan to Barnsley expired this summer. Orlando City reportedly rejected a $10m (£7.5m) offer for the striker back in March, as he remained highly valued at Orlando for both his playing abilities and as an asset. ""Last year, he had the opportunity to move to England and play in the Championship, which gave him a different experience in his career,"" his now-former teammate Nani told GOAL last summer. ""He could build up his game a little bit more and improve his strength and his qualities and managed to score a couple of goals. ""He’s a young player. He has a lot of things he can still improve but he’s a player who can fly very high. He’s just got to keep his feet on the ground and continue to work hard and have a good mentality."" But, as the season wore on, it was easy to see that Dike was feeling the grind of what he'd just gone through. He'd yet to truly play a full professional season, and tiredness looked like it had set in. After shining for the U.S. men's national team in the run-up to the Gold Cup, Dike fell down the pecking order a bit as he struggled to match the level many had grown accustomed to. Dike was good for Orlando City, scoring 10 goals in 18 appearances, but the interest and the hype began to die down a bit amid Pepi's emergence. Still, the fee Orlando City received for Dike should not be overlooked. With that $9.5m fee, Dike is the fifth-most expensive sale in MLS history, putting him in the company of Miguel Amiron, Alphonso Davies, Pity Martinez and, of course, Pepi, who has just joined Augsburg for $20m (£15m). West Brom, then, clearly have high expectations for Dike. They firmly believe he can fire them into the Premier League, as they currently sit fourth in the Championship within four points of automatic promotion.  Indeed, West Brom boss Valerien Ismael was in charge of Barnsley last season when Dike broke out, so he knows exactly what the forward is capable of. “If you see the teams above us at the moment, Bournemouth have [Dominic] Solanke, Fulham have [Aleksandar] Mitrovic, Blackburn have [Ben] Brereton Diaz,” Ismael pointed out just before the Dike deal was completed. “I think that it shows we are lacking a goalscorer – we have had so many chances but at the minute we aren’t taking those chances. Now it’s time to do something in that area.” That something is Dike, who joins early enough in the month to jump right in for the second half of the Championship season. West Brom are set to face Brighton this weekend in the FA Cup, but Ismael has already earmarked the club's next league game against QPR as the one where Dike could make his much-anticipated debut. “When I was at Barnsley last season with the boss, we did really well to push up the table and finish in the play-off positions,"" Dike said of Ismael. “The boss was a big part of that and I feel as though he brings the best out in players. “It’s important for me to go into a club which has a coach I have already worked with and I know the system we are going to play. “He seems to like me and I like him too. Having that knowledge when you go to a place which at first is a little unfamiliar, it's great to have.” It remains to be seen if Dike is called into the USMNT squad for upcoming qualifiers against El Salvador, Canada and Honduras.  As things stand, he's one of several young stars vying for the spot as the team's No.9, with Pepi, Matthew Hoppe, Josh Sargent and Jordan Pefok all in the mix as well. That competition will only heat up on the road to Qatar, and that competition will largely be determined by players' club form over the next 12 months.  The USMNT's players are now facing a legacy-defining year when it comes to both qualifying for the World Cup and, ultimately, earning their place there when and if that happens. Dike has taken his first step towards earning his spot, taking a brave leap into the Championship with a club that should give him the chance to shine.  The ball's in his court now, as he looks to achieve both his Premier League and World Cup dreams after finalizing his long-awaited move to England.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/dike-west-brom-usmnt-star-premier-league-dreams-begin/blte74b88279fe74176,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3194,"Arsenal 'building something special', says Odegaard, as Arteta brings 'fun' factor back for Gunners","Martin Odegaard has been in dazzling form for Arsenal over recent weeks and the Norway international believes the Gunners are “building something special” in an ongoing bid to secure a top-four finish and a return to the Champions League for 2022-23. Mikel Arteta’s side made light work of a 2-0 win over Leicester in their most recent outing and have now collected five successive victories in the English top flight – and nine in their last 11 stretching back to mid-December. The north London outfit find themselves in fourth spot as a result – one point clear of Manchester United but boasting games in hand on all of those around them – and Odegaard admits that confidence is soaring. Odegaard, with five goals and four assists to his name this season, told TV2: “There is clearly something special going on here now. You feel it in the whole club. “We are building something special. It’s a group of players who like each other, and who enjoy playing football together.” He added: “It's fun to play on that team here. We are a group that knows each other well. “We are getting better and better and the system is getting better and better. It's flowing very well now. It's fun to play. “We understand each other better, and the team works very well. Then it's easier to look good for me too.” Arsenal paid £30 million ($39m) to sign Odegaard on a permanent basis from Real Madrid in the summer of 2021, with a productive loan spell last season showcasing what he is capable of. That deal now looks like quite the bargain, given the inflated price tags which have become commonplace in modern football, with added creativity being embraced by the Gunners. Arteta is among those to have been impressed by a 23-year-old fulfilling his potential after bursting onto a senior stage as a precociously-gifted teenager, but the Spaniard is wary of putting too much pressure on an in-form star. He told Sky Sports when asked if Odegaard looks like being one of the signings of the season: “I don't know, it's still a bit early to say that. “We were certainly convinced he was a player that could fit in our club, with our morals. He has every value that we want players to represent at this club, and then he has the quality for what we want to do. We are really happy with him. “He's come a long way since his arrival, he is showing great maturity and responsibility on the pitch and he makes the other players better, I think.” Arsenal will be back in action on Wednesday when playing host to title-chasing Liverpool.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/odegaard-arsenal-building-something-special-arteta-fun/blt860a7b16e674c3a8,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8695,Leo Messi signed his first Barca contract on a napkin — 20 years after the napkin still exists,"When 13-year-old Lionel Messi arrived in Barcelona in 2000, he impressed Barca chiefs so much that they wanted to tie him down to a deal with the club as soon as possible.Believe it or not, one of the most important contracts in modern football's history was written and signed on a napkin in a cafeteria!On December 14, 2000, Messi's representative in Spain Horacio Gaggioli met the then-technical secretary and coordinator of youth teams Carles Rexach for a game of tennis. After the game, they sat down in Barca's cafeteria. Football agent Josep Maria Minguella joined them.From left to right: Horacio Gaggioli, Carles Rexach and Josep Maria Minguella:According to Marca, Gaggioli and Minguella pressured Rexach to make a quick decision about Messi. Rexach took a napkin and wrote:""In Barcelona, on Dec. 14, 2000, in the presence of [Josep Maria] Minguella and Horacio [Gaggioli], Carles Rexach, FC Barcelona's sporting director, hereby agrees, under his responsibility and regardless of any dissenting opinions, to sign the player Lionel Messi provided that we keep to the amounts agreed upon.""Rexach, Minguella and Gaggioli then signed the napkin. Interestingly, from Rexach's point of view, the decision was all his and Minguella and Gaggioli didn't need to convince him.""Messi? I signed him in 30 seconds,"" Rexach said. ""In my 40 years of football, I had never seen anything like it. Out of five goal situations, he converts four. And he has exceptional skills. They reminded me of the prime Maradona.""I signed his first contract, symbolically, on a napkin: I wanted to hire him as soon as possible, couldn't let him slip away.""Does that famous napkin still exist and if yes, where is it now?According to Infobae (h/t/ Marca), the legendary piece of paper belongs to Horacio Gaggioli.

""That piece of paper changed the modern history of the club. I think it should be there, preferably next to Messi's Ballon d'Or's.""Horacio Gaggioli with the famous napkin contact:There have been contacts between Gaggioli and Barca's museum but the negotiations stopped after the club suggested that the 'napkin deal' was a 'confidential contract' that was not supposed to be exposed. Gaggioli objected: ""While it was always considered to be a kind of contract, it was really a commitment without any money changing hands. I was always in favour of the napkin being displayed in the museum, and if one day it leaves [the bank in] Andorra, that is where it will go.""That day hasn't come yet: even though Leo Messi is no longer at the club, the napkin is still in the bank safe.",https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-18-leo-messi-signed-his-first-barca-contract-on-a-napkin-20-years-after-the-napkin-still-exi/,,2024-01-19T04:00:00.000Z,Tribuna

5823,Real Madrid's Hazard sidelined again after undergoing successful surgery,"Real Madrid winger Eden Hazard underwent surgery on Tuesday as the Belgian star is set for another spell on the sidelines. Hazard has dealt with a reoccurring injury issue for some time and has now undergone surgery to remove a plate that was originally put in after he broke his ankle in March 2020.

After the quick throw from Raya and Martinelli's unbelievable run, Saka almost scored a header.

He needed just 3 minutes for this. Saka scored his goal in the 14th minute, after an amazing team combination. Havertz could be the hero of the moment but he couldn't outplay Alisson.

10122,Equatorial Guinea vs Guinea Prediction and Preview,"Group A winners and AFCON 2023 surprise package Equatorial Guinea take on Guinea, who qualified as the best of the third-place teams, in the round of 16. We look ahead to the game with our Equatorial Guinea vs Guinea prediction and preview. Equatorial Guinea have been the surprise package of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, having topped Group A ahead of AFCON heavyweights Nigeria and Ivory Coast, scoring nine goals in three games that included a 4-2 win over Guinea-Bissau and a 4-0 hammering of Ivory Coast, who are also the tournament’s hosts.  They were the AFCON 2023 group stage’s top scorers, more than playing their part in what is one of the highest-scoring and most entertaining AFCON tournaments ever. With their nine goals coming from just 3.97 xG, their overperformance compared to their xG of 5.03 was higher than any other team at the tournament. More of their shots from inside the box resulted in goals (seven) than did not (six). They stormed into the knockout rounds, confirming their progression out of the group at AFCON once again; they have now made it into the knockouts at all four AFCON tournaments they have played in. Guinea have more AFCON pedigree than their opponents here, but having scored just four goals in their last eight AFCON games and having lost each of their last six knockout games, the fact they have more experience at this stage of the tournament won’t count for much. Guinea also only made it out of their group in third place, although it should be said they finished behind Senegal and Cameroon in a tough group. They were only beaten to second place by Cameroon on goals scored, and they ended the group stage with the best record of the third-placed teams. They ended their group-stage campaign with a 2-0 defeat to Senegal, and were subjected to a third-place finish after Cameroon secured a dramatic late win over Gambia. AFCON 2023’s top scorer, Equatorial Guinea striker Emilio Nsue – formerly of Birmingham and Middlesbrough – will be the man to stop from Guinea’s point of view. At 34 years of age, he is already the oldest player to reach five goals at an AFCON tournament; with one more goal, he would become only the second player ever aged 30+ to make it to six goals. This will be the first meeting at an Africa Cup of Nations tournament between Equatorial Guinea and Guinea. Interestingly, though, this will be the third time at this tournament that Equatorial Guinea have faced an opponent for the first time at AFCON, drawing 1-1 with Nigeria and beating Guinea-Bissau 4-2. Equatorial Guinea are favourites to win this one having come through a tough group as surprise winners. The Opta supercomputer gives them a 42.5% chance of victory, compared to 31.5% for Guinea. In the week leading up to AFCON 2023, our pre-tournament predictions gave Equatorial Guinea just a 0.8% chance of winning the whole tournament. That has increased more than five-fold after such an impressive group stage. Below are the current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 for both sides according to the Opta supercomputer: Equatorial Guinea: Aitor Embela, Manuel Sapunga, Jesús Owono, Saúl Coco, Basilio Ndong, Carlos Akapo, Esteban Orozco, Néstor Senra, Marvin Anieboh, Emilio Nsue, José Elo, Charles Ondo, Féderico Bikoro, José Machín, Santiago Eneme, Pablo Ganet, Álex Balboa, Jannick Buyla, Iban Salvador, José Miranda, Óscar Siafá, José Nabil, Salomón Obama, Noé Ela, Luís Asué.  Coach: Juan Michá Guinea: Ibrahim Koné, Aly Keita, Moussa Camara, Mohamed Ali Camara, Sekou Sylla, Julian Jeanvier, Saïdou Sow, Mouctar Diakhaby, Antoine Conté, Issiaga Sylla, Ibrahim Diakité, Seydouba Cissé, Amadou Diawara, Naby Keïta, Mory Konaté, Ilaix Moriba, Abdoulaye Touré, Aguibou Camara, Mohamed Bayo, José Kanté, Serhou Guirassy, Morgan Guilavogui, Facinet Conté, Karim Cissé, François Kamano.  Coach: Kaba Diawara Enjoy this?

2239,Explained: Aubameyang's transfer from Arsenal to Barcelona & what the future holds,"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang formed part of one of the more high-profile deals done during the January transfer window of 2022, with the Gabon international striker swapping life at Arsenal for that at Barcelona. Few could have predicted at the start of the season that such a move would be made, as he had filled the captain’s armband at Emirates Stadium, but it came as little surprise when it was pushed through as the experienced forward had been frozen out in north London. Aubameyang has gone on to hit the ground running at Camp Nou, but what kind of deal took him from the Premier League to La Liga and where will he be playing next season? GOAL takes a look... Aubameyang fell out of favour at Arsenal in December 2021 following a breach of club discipline. He was stripped of captaincy duties and overlooked by Mikel Arteta as the Gunners sought inspiration from elsewhere in an ongoing bid to secure a top-four finish. It had become clear by the time the winter window swung open that the proven goalscorer was going to need a new challenge. Barca, after seeing Sergio Aguero forced into retirement, were in the market for another frontman and could not believe their luck when an opportunity to snap up Aubameyang presented itself. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's deadline day - a short story 😅￭ Arrives in Barcelona, with loan said to be imminent￭ Talks break down￭ Joan Laporta claims deal is back on track￭ Medical is booked￭ Barca agree to sign him on a free￭ Signs contract just before deadline pic.twitter.com/NbkPJWSfku A loan agreement was initially explored by the Liga heavyweights, but it quickly became apparent that they could not afford to take on a £340,000-a-week contract. With Arsenal also reluctant to keep funding that salary on a deal that was due to run until 2023, they agreed to rip up terms with a former fan favourite and allow him to leave on a free transfer. Aubameyang subsequently agreed a three-and-a-half-year contract with Barca meaning that, despite there being plenty of talk regarding summer swoops for another striker, he will be sticking around for the 2022-23 campaign and beyond. Questions were always going to be asked of Arsenal once they agreed to let a proven performer walk away for nothing. Arteta, though, had been backed into a corner and a parting of ways became the best option for all concerned. The Gunners will have no regrets, but they have been forced to watch on from afar as Aubameyang has hit the ground running in Spain. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang just keeps scoring for Barcelona 🔥 pic.twitter.com/HtLGW0Hm1J After being forced to wait until his fourth outing for Barca before opening his goal account, the floodgates have opened in some style. Aubameyang netted a hat-trick against Valencia on February 20, bagged a brace in a stunning 4-0 Clasico victory over arch-rivals Real Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu on March 20 and now has 10 efforts to his name through 14 appearances. In the same period of time, going back to February 1, Arsenal have managed just 12 goals as a collective through nine Premier League games.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/explained-aubameyang-transfer-arsenal-barcelona/blta1b41ee414a9de0d,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7900,"Kylian Mbappe has told Real Madrid he wants to join this summer, PSG departure was decided âweeks agoâ","On Thursday, it was widely reported that Kylian Mbappe has decided to leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season, when his current contract is set to expire. It opens the door for the 24-year-old world class forward to finally join Real Madrid, who have been after him for several years.  Although no agreement has been reached with Mbappe as of yet, Real Madrid are said to be very confident of closing an agreement soon. As per Relevo, club officials expect everything to be finalised in a matter of weeks, as Mbappe has already given his word to Los Blancos that he wants to join. Furthermore, the report notes that Mbappe actually came to his decision to leave PSG several weeks ago, although it was only communication to Nasser al-Khelaifi, the clubâs president, in the last few days. For now, Mbappeâs full focus is on PSG, whom he hopes to help finally win the Champions League as his last act. Real Madrid are continuing to work towards an agreement of personal terms, but itâs highly likely that Florentino Perez will finally get his man at the umpteenth time of asking.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Kylian-Mbappe-has-told-Real-Madrid-he-wants-to-join-this-summer-PSG-departure-was-decided-%E2%80%9Cweeks-ago%E2%80%9D/3302314,,23 hours ago,all-football-app
11535,About That Game: Lazio 1-2 Roma (2010),"About That Game is a series looking at the data stories underpinning classic matches. This edition looks back at one of the most famous Derby della Capitale fixtures, as Lazio and Roma squared off in April 2010. In what proved to be a masterstroke, Roma legends Francesco Totti and Daniele De Rossi were substituted at half-time, as Roma turned a 1-0 deficit around in the second half. 18 April 2010. Stadio Olimpico. Lazio vs. Roma. It’s half-time: Roma are 1-0 down against their arch-rivals. Only a week before, the Giallorossi had overtaken Inter at the top of Serie A following a run of 23 unbeaten games (17 wins and six draws). Back in October the points gap to Inter was -14 and the reigning champions, then managed by José Mourinho, looked pretty solid and on their way to another title. Roma, who had appointed Claudio Ranieri at the start of September, following Luciano Spalletti’s departure with the team bottom of the table after defeats in their opening two league games, were never supposed to be challenging at the top. Leicester’s fairytale would not happen for another five years, but Ranieri was already warming up his miracle-making prowess.   Led by local legend, Francesco Totti, and supported by another one, Daniele De Rossi, Roma had created an incredible team spirit between those mainstay members of the side and a bunch of unlikely heroes. Those heroes, by the way, who frequently chipped in with important goals in decisive matches (see Luca Toni’s winner vs. Inter, Marco Cassetti’s strike to win the first Rome Derby of the season, John Arne Riise’s last-minute header away at Juventus, Mirko Vučinić with numerous crucial goals), and on 11 April a 2-1 home win against Atalanta, coupled with Inter dropping two points in Florence, meant the Giallorossi were finally top of the table. 45 minutes into the “away” derby fixture though, and Roma are about to surrender their single-point lead at the summit of Serie A after only one week. The stats at half-time are a pretty grim sight for Ranieri. His players are feeling the pressure, with too much to lose against a team currently fifth from bottom. They are cripplingly nervous, too, and will finish the game with eight yellow cards – the most they’ll pick up in a single Serie A match this season. By the end of the first half, they’ve not managed a single shot on target, Ranieri’s 4-3-3 formation is not working and his two Roman leaders on the pitch (Totti & De Rossi) are already in the referee’s book. This is when Ranieri decides to show he is not just a gentleman but a brave manager too. He does what no one would ever dream of doing, something that will go down in the history books of this incredible derby. With hindsight, people said he gambled, but you have to be confident in your ability to make that kind of gamble. During the break he tells the two AS Roma icons to stay in the dressing room: “They felt the game too much” he explained later. So, Totti is replaced by Jérémy Ménez, De Rossi hooked for Rodrigo Taddei. As soon as the teams trot out for the second half the Roma fans in the stadium stay silent, incredulous, scratching their heads. One minute later things could get a lot worse. Lazio get a penalty, as Aleksandar Kolarov is felled inside the box by Marco Cassetti. 2-0 and there is no way back for the Giallorossi. But fate has other plans and Julio Sergio saves Sergio Floccari’s tame effort. The game changes, momentum shifts and Ranieri’s men start believing. Seven minutes later there’s another penalty, involving Kolarov again. But this time it’s in his own box, and he fouls substitute Taddei. Mirko Vučinić doesn’t miss. 1-1. 63 minutes, Ranieri’s other substitute is fouled, Ménez tripped on the edge of the box in a dangerous location. Vucinic again hovers over the dead ball. The Montenegrin smashes it straight through the wall, which breaks early. Fernando Muslera barely moves as the ball rockets passed him. 1-2. Lazio are galvanised into action and attempt 11 second-half shots without any luck. In pure Derby della Capitale style there is still room for a Lazio red card for Cristian Ledesma and a brawl at the final whistle. In total, 13 cards were shown during this game (12 yellows, one red) the most of any Serie A fixture in 2009-10. That sentiment spilt out into the stands, as there were riots on the terraces and clashes outside the stadium. But despite that mammoth effort it wasn’t meant to be for Roma. A week later, Ranieri’s side lost 2-1 at home to Sampdoria and despite winning the last three games of the season, finished two points behind Inter, as Mourinho’s side swooped the treble. For Claudio Ranieri, it was a case of so close and yet so far in his native city. For Roma fans, the last scudetto remains the one from 2000-01. But there is hope. The manager who pipped them to the title that season now sits in their dugout. Roma fans would surely forgive Mourinho’s 2009-10 title victory at their expense if he could deliver them their first Serie A win in over 20 years. You can watch the full highlights of the game here.

750,"Chelsea target Fofana 'is not for sale' & Leicester have yet to receive an offer for Arsenal-linked Tielemans, says Rodgers","Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers has insisted Wesley Fofana is not for sale amid rumours linking the defender with a transfer to Chelsea. The 21-year-old has excelled since joining the Foxes in 2020 and his performances have led to speculation of a potential big-money move away. But Rodgers has claimed Fofana is going nowhere, while also assuring Leicester fans that no bids have come in for Arsenal target Youri Tielemans. It has been reported that Chelsea have identified Fofana as a priority target as head coach Thomas Tuchel seeks to reinforce his backline following the departure of Antonio Rudiger. Rodgers is still counting on the Frenchman for the 2022-23 season, though, as he said when quizzed on the Blues' interest: ""No, he’s not for sale. ""When we looked at him he had made 17 league starts. Everyone had a look at him back then but he’s come here, really flourished and developed, not just as a player but as a young man. ""He really respects the club, I’ve got no doubt that in the future he’ll be on that [highest] stage but he’s very comfortable, he feels good here. ""He has a great relationship with his team-mates which is important and there’s no doubt he will grace that stage. But for now he’s here, he’s developing and like I said he’s not for sale.

I’ve had long chats with him. ""He can’t stop the speculation but he’s very concentrated on his work here and very focused on his development."" On Tielemans' future, Rodgers added: ""There has not been anything for him, we haven’t had any approaches to the club yet on that. ""Of course it is in the back of the mind, that sort of what-if scenario, but he doesn’t want anything to drag on either."" Tielemans has just a year remaining on his contract at the King Power Stadium and has been linked with a possible £30 million ($37m) move to Arsenal, but GOAL reported in June that they had cooled their interest in his services to focus on alternative targets.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-target-fofana-not-for-sale-leicester-offer-arsenal/blt8766c89cdcf03cf0,Callum Rice-Coates,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

10416,Opta Power Rankings: The Top 10 Football Teams in Africa,"We all love to rank things, right? Here, we list the top 10 football teams in Africa according to the Opta Power Rankings. African football’s influence on the rest of the world – especially the top five European leagues – shouldn’t be understated. Although the competitions and leagues may not be regarded as highly as those on other continents, Africa is, and has always been, a hotbed of talent and potential. For example, of the 2,725 players to play at least one match in Europe’s top five leagues in the 2022-23 season, 11.7% of them were considered to be from African countries in Opta’s database. South America, perhaps thought by many as a bigger producer of talent, only accounted for 9.7%. Of course, there are many nuances here and grey areas within nationality and identity; for instance, these statistics don’t take into account players who are potentially born in Africa and represent a country from a different continent, however it’s still illustrative of African football’s importance to the world’s biggest competitions. Nevertheless, African club football arguably doesn’t receive the same attention beyond its borders as South, Central and North American, and Asian football do, so we’re here to shed some light on Africa’s 10 top clubs according to the Opta Power Rankings, which is a global team ranking system that assigns a score to nearly 13,500 domestic football teams on a scale of zero to 100; 100 being the best team in the world and zero being the lowest-ranked side. You’ll find a full explainer on the Opta Power Rankings elsewhere on Opta Analyst, but right now we’re here to provide the lowdown on the 10 best-ranked African teams. The 11-time Tunisian champions and one of only three clubs from the country to win the CAF Champions League, ES Sahel are one of Africa’s best-supported teams. They were Tunisia’s first representatives at the FIFA Club World Cup in 2007 and that year became only the second African club to reach the semi-finals of that competition after Al Ahly, losing 1-0 to Boca Juniors. A club that shares its name with probably the most famous fictitious animal in modern pop culture; what’s not to love? We should point out Simba is Swahili for Lion, so no, there’s no official Disney or Lion King tie-in here. But just like Mufasa’s son, Simba – formerly known as Sunderland… – have reigned supreme for much of their existence. Their 22 Tanzanian Premier League title wins is second only to rivals Young Africans (or Yanga as they’re commonly known) on 24 and they are CAF Champions League regulars, going deepest into the competition in 1972 when they finished as runners-up to Hafia FC. Simba’s rivals and Tanzania’s most successful club, Yanga’s prominent position in the rankings was helped by a very positive 2022-23 season that saw them win their domestic title and reach the final of the CAF Confederation Cup, Africa’s secondary continental competition. They ultimately fell short in the two-legged final, losing on away goals to USM Alger of Algeria after a 2-2 aggregate draw. Their forward Fiston Kalala Mayele finished as the tournament’s top scorer, though he’s since moved on to Pyramids FC of Egypt. One of Morocco’s oldest clubs, FUS enjoyed the greatest success in the club’s history in 2010 when they beat Tunisia’s Club Sportif Sfaxien in the final. A 0-0 draw in Rabat had given CS Sfaxien the upper hand, but FUS triumphed 3-2 in the second leg in Sfax, with Mohamed Zouidi scoring twice in the final 15 minutes to ensured a dramatic turnaround. Glory on the domestic front has rarely been attainable, but they did win Botola Pro, the top tier, in 2015-16. They finished third last term. FUS’s local rivals and one of three clubs never to have been relegated from Morocco’s top league, AS FAR are one of the country’s most successful teams, particularly domestically. They are the reigning Botola champions having pipped Wydad Casablanca by a point; that was their 13th league title and first since 2008. AS FAR are also one of only two Moroccan clubs to win both the CAF Confederation Cup and CAF Champions League, though they last enjoyed success in the latter way back in 1985. The other Moroccan team to win each of Africa’s top two club competitions, though unlike AS FAR, Raja AC have lifted both trophies at least twice. They were Confederation Cup champions in 2018 and 2021, although Champions League success hasn’t been possible since winning their third crown in 1999. Raja have also never been relegated from Morocco’s top division and have won it 12 times, most recently in 2020, making them one of three clubs to be champions on more than 10 occasions. While many of the clubs in this list are steeped in history, Pyramids are a rather newer creation. Initially founded as Al Assiouty Sport in 2008, they were bought 10 year later by Turki Al-Sheikh, owner of La Liga side Almería, an advisor to Saudi Arabia’s royal court and head of the Saudi General Entertainment Authority. He’d previously been Al Ahly honorary president but resigned after internal squabbling and bought Al Assiouty before changing their name and moving them to Cairo, roughly 400 kilometres from their previous home in Beni Seuf. A year later they were sold to an Emirati businessman, though their steady rise has continued, finishing second in the Egyptian Premier League for each of the past two seasons. They were also runners-up in the 2019-20 Confederation Cup. Morocco have two times as many representatives in this top 10 as any other nation, with Wydad the highest of the four. After all, they are the country’s most successful club. Only four clubs in the entire continent can better their three CAF Champions League successes, the most recent of which was in 2022, and they’ve won nine more domestic championships (22) than any other team. Wydad also reached the 2023 CAF Champions League final but were defeated 3-2 on aggregate by… Africa’s most successful club by most measures, and probably the most well-known. Incredibly, they’ve won the Egyptian top flight 43 times – 29 more than bitter rivals Zamalek – and have enjoyed continental success unlike any other African team. When they defeated Wydad in 2023, Al Ahly won their 11th CAF Champions League title; to put that into context, no other club has won it more than five times (Zamalek and TP Mazembe of DR Congo). Astonishingly, nine of those Champions League wins have come since the turn of the century, and they’ve also finished runners-up four times in that period. No other African club has played in more than nine finals, and yet Al Ahly have won the whole thing as many times in a 23-year period. They lost the CAF Super Cup in September to USM Alger, however, and were denied a place in the final of the inaugural African Football League at the start of November by the continent’s top-ranked team… South Africa’s dominant force. Mamelodi Sundowns have won more South African Premiership titles (13) since its 1996 inception than the next three most successful clubs combined (Orlando Pirates – 4; Kaizer Chiefs – 4; SuperSport United – 3). Much of that is down to their remarkable record in more recent times, winning eight of the past 10 league championships. In fact, neither the Orlando Pirates nor the Kaizer Chiefs have won it since the latter did so in 2014-15. The Sundowns’ position atop the African power rankings is undoubtedly partly down to their brilliant start to the 2023-24 campaign, winning all of their first eight league matches and conceding just three times in the process. Despite being head and shoulders above the competition domestically, Sundowns haven’t quite been able to turn that into continental domination. They are regulars in the latter stages of the CAF Champions League, reaching the quarter-finals at least in each of the past five seasons, but they’ve not won the competition since 2016. However, they did enjoy continental glory on Sunday. They beat Wydad 2-0 in the second leg of their African Football League final to secure a 3-2 aggregate success. Enjoy this?

4449,‘The best' - Haaland pays tribute to Raiola following agent's death,"Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland has been paying his respects to Mino Raiola following the announcement of the Italian agent’s death, with the Norwegian expressing his sadness at losing “the best”. It was revealed on Saturday that Raiola had passed away at the age of 54 following much-publicised health issues. He had been a larger-than-life character that boasted a star-studded client list, with many of those delivering their own personal tributes on social media. Haaland, who is expected to leave Dortmund this summer as part of a big-money transfer, has posted on Instagram. A man that also worked with AC Milan frontman Zlatan Ibrahimovic throughout his career has seen the likes of Mario Balotelli and Moise Kean post tributes on Instagram, with the Italian strikers other clients of Raiola. Balotelli has said: “You will always be with me in life and in football! Your reproaches, aids, advice, jokes and strategies will always be in my head.“I LOVE YOU AND I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU as a second father and I know that from up there you will always be present in our lives! Have a good trip Mino.” Juventus forward Kean added: “I still can’t believe, you took me out from the streets and you made me learn so many principles in life… to be honest it’s not a not goodbye for us wherever you are you will always be in my heart. R.I.P BIG Boss.” A statement from Raiola’s family posted to social media at the time of his death read: “In infinite sorrow, we share the passing of the most caring and amazing football agent that ever was. “Mino fought until the end with the same strength he put on negotiation tables to defend our players. As usual, Mino made us proud and never realised it. “Mino touched so many lives through his work and wrote a new chapter in the history of modern football.

3772,Fofana joins Chelsea from Leicester City in record-breaking £75m transfer,"WHAT HAPPENED? The 21-year-old defender joins the Blues from Leicester on a seven-year contract. He will partner Kalidou Koulibaly and Thiago Silva in Thomas Tuchel's three-man defence at Chelsea. The final deal sees Fofana become the most expensive defensive signing in the Blues' history, breaking the previous record set by Marc Cucurella - who joined from Brighton for £62m earlier in the window. WHAT THEY SAID: Fofana told Chelsea's official website after the announcement: ""The two last days have been really big days for me and I’m very happy. I trained this morning with the team and it’s a dream for me. I’m very excited to start playing games for the fans and the club. ""I’m here win trophies – the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup, everything. I came here to win and the club is built to win trophies so I’m here to continue that."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: The Frenchman joined Leicester City in 2020 and was a regular starter under Brendan Rodgers in his maiden season. He missed the majority of the 2021-22 campaign after fracturing his ankle but returned for full fitness in March and will be ready to integrate straight into the Chelsea squad. He played in 52 matches in total for Leicester, 37 of which came in the Premier League. IN THREE PHOTOS:    THE VERDICT:  Fofana described as a ""generational talent"" that could prove to be a bargain for the Blues... Chelsea owner Todd Boehly reportedly had a big role in securing the deal, but will it prove to be a masterstroke?  WHAT NEXT FOR CHELSEA?

6052,'I'm very sorry' - Yilmaz retires from Turkey duty after skying crucial penalty in World Cup 2022 play-off clash with Portugal,"Veteran Turkey star Burak Yilmaz sent his nation out of the World Cup qualifiers after failing to hit the target with a penalty that would have tied Thursday's play-off with Portugal. The Lille striker, 36, had dragged his side back into the game with a goal to make it 2-1, following Otavio and Diogo Jota's first-half strikes. But when he had the chance to level with just six minutes left on the clock, Yilmaz sent his effort into the stratosphere, to the obvious relief of Portugal who went on to make the game safe through Matheus and book a final place against North Macedonia. ⏱️ 84'🇵🇹 2-1 🇹🇷Burak Yılmaz has missed a vital penalty! 😲 pic.twitter.com/aoIaODW5M4 Yilmaz misses from the spot, what a let off for Portugal! 😱 pic.twitter.com/nnqyqUEoIP After the game, which saw Yilmaz earn his 77th cap and register a 31st goal for his country, the experienced frontman announced that he will be heading into international retirement. He told reporters at the end of an emotional night for all concerned: “I don’t know how I didn’t score, I'm still in shock. We upset our country. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. This was my last World Cup chance. As of today, this is over. “I said to myself it was a definite goal when we got the penalty. I started thinking about the future. I am disappointed because I never thought about missing it. I'm sorry. I'm going to score this penalty every night of my life, maybe without sleep, in my dreams. “I wouldn't want to quit after a game like this, but I don't think it's right to continue. Thank you to my coaches. My decision to quit is not emotional. I make this decision logically. If extreme, unbelievable situations occur, then I will help. “Our country needs to pass the flag on to our young friends. The new generation, the new structure. This is the right thing.

5653,England deny 'Football's Coming Home' anthem will be axed amid report it's too offensive to be used at Qatar World Cup,"The Football Association has moved to rubbish reports suggesting that England’s famous ‘Three Lions’ anthem could be axed “amid concerns that is offends other nations”. Said claim was made by tabloid newspaper The Sun, with the FA allegedly ready to remove a ‘Football’s Coming Home’ anthem from its playlist for home international fixtures at Wembley and another World Cup adventure that will be opened in Qatar later this year. The song, which was first released back in 1996 ahead of a European Championship finals on English soil that summer, will not be going anywhere, though, as unsubstantiated claims from afar are being played down. A statement from the FA reads: “Contrary to reports this morning, The FA still plays Three Lions at major Wembley matches and has never had any intention of doing otherwise. “The song belongs to the fans and is about the hope of following the England team. “It was requested by the FA to be played as one of our team songs at the 2018 World Cup and at the EUROs last summer, and this is our plan at tournaments going forwards.” While moving to rubbish the reports suggesting that they are prepared to bin ‘Three Lions’, David Baddiel – who features on the track alongside Frank Skinner and The Lightning Seeds – has previously claimed that the FA are not fans. The avid Chelsea supporter has said, with ‘Sweet Caroline’ being introduced as a potential rival to ‘Football’s Coming Home’: “Neil Diamond was set up as a kind of rival during the last Euro competition. “There was a thing which my manager feels was actually a conspiracy set up by The FA — they don't really like Three Lions. “I think it's the notion — misinterpreted by many people — that football's coming home means that England owns football and we are the homeland of football. Which historically is the case. We were the first one to ratify the rules of the game. “But somehow that's offensive to other FAs - like the Croatian FA or whatever.” Other countries have taken issue with ‘Football’s Coming Home’ in the past, with Croatia and Italy looking to use the message it spreads across an expectant fan base in England as added motivation ahead of contests at the 2018 World Cup and Euro 2020 in which they dashed the Three Lions’ dreams.

1782,Ziyech confirms he will not be returning for Morocco as Chelsea star blasts 'misinformation',"Hakim Ziyech has denied claims that he will come out of international retirement to play for Morocco again. The Chelsea star has not featured for the national team since June 2021 and subsequently announced he would not be available for selection. Moroccan football association (FRMF) president Fouzi Lekjaa said this weekend that the 28-year-old would be called up for the upcoming World Cup qualifying matches this month. But Ziyech has taken to Instagram to condemn the president's comments, labelling them ""misinformation"". He posted: ""I love my country and playing for the Moroccan national football team has been the honour of my lifetime, so it is with great sadness that I must announce that although the FRMF President today confirmed that I will be pre-selected for the team, I won’t be returning to play for Morocco. ""I’m sorry to disappoint the fans, this was not an easy decision to make, but sadly I feel I have no other choice. ""Despite giving my all to the team over the past 6 years and supporting them my entire life, the leadership continue to release misinformation about me and my commitment to my country. Their actions have made it impossible for me to continue to be part of the team. ""I learned the news about the pre-selection at the same time as everyone else, so I’m releasing this statement to ensure that you hear the truth directly from me. ""Thank you to everyone who has supported me, I wish the team nothing but the best for the future. ""My focus as a player is at my club Chelsea FC."" Ziyech's retirement came in the wake of a dispute with coach Vahid Halilhodzic. The veteran coach criticised the winger's attitude as he left him out of the squad last September, saying: “He arrived late and after that, he even refused to work. There was no point in discussing it afterwards, as a coach the answer is right there to see. ""He doesn't want to train, doesn't want to play. He doesn't take it seriously. I'm not going to beg him to come back."" Halilhodzic then criticised Ziyech again in February this year, saying that he would not be recalled ""even if his name is Lionel Messi"". Ziyech announced days later that his national team career was over, saying: ""I understand them, but I will not return to the Moroccan national team and this is my final decision.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ziyech-not-returning-morocco-chelsea-star-misinformation/blt1b732546f35b5499,By Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4167,Libya name Corentin Martins as coach as Malawi deny Marinica's ‘extravagant hotel claims’,"Libya have named Corentin Martins as the new coach of their senior national team and he replaces Spanish trainer Javier Clemente. The 52-year-old coach signed a one-year contract with the Libya Football Federation to take charge of the Mediterranean Knights. Clemente left his position by mutual consent, paving the way for Martins’ entrance. Martins had been fired as a coach of Mauritania seven months ago. After serving for seven years as Mauritania’s tactician, former Simba SC head coach Manuel Da Rosa was appointed to succeed him. Da Rosa was dismissed too but after he had guided the North Africans to the 2021 Afcon finals in Cameroon. Martins will, additionally, take charge of the Libyan team that will battle in the African Nations Championship (Chan) qualifiers. Meanwhile, the Football Association of Malawi has refuted claims they are being extravagant in how they spend on their new coach, Mario Marinica, who recently replaced Meke Mwase. ""The truth of the matter is that since his arrival in the country in November 2021, Mr. Marinica has been staying at Hotel Amaryllis,"" the federation noted. ""Initially this was supposed to be a temporary arrangement for a month as he was finalising his employment and work permit documentation. Marinica had to accompany the Flames to Saudi Arabia for pre- Afcon camping in December and Cameroon for the Afcon in January. ""The Flames left Malawi on December 23rd, 2021, and returned on January 28th, 2022. Upon his return from Afcon, Marinica was supposed to be provided with accommodation within Blantyre as provided in his employment contract.  ""As FAM was in the process of identifying the house, Amaryllis Hotel offered a special ‘long -stay package’ which effectively addressed the accommodation needs of Mr. Marinica and was also found to be cost-effective for FAM. ""Amaryllis Hotel offered FAM a special rate of K900,000.00 per month, including all services apart from meals [lunch and dinner]. The public may wish to appreciate that the rentals for fully furnished houses being offered were in the range of K900,000–K1.2 million per month.""

570,Which football team does Tom Brady support?,"Tom Brady enjoyed a busy weekend as the guest of honour for Manchester United's Premier League win over Tottenham on Saturday before reversing his decision to retire from NFL on Sunday. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback announced that he would play on 40 days after announcing he would hang up his boots, shortly after watching Cristiano Ronaldo deliver a superb performance for the Red Devils. But from one superstar to another, just who does Brady support? GOAL brings you everything you need to know about his soccer allegiance. Brady has shown his allegience for several sides and players over the years, but most recently appeared to back Manchester United. Watching the Premier League side in action from the surroundings of the Director's Box at Old Trafford this weekend, the star was visibly delighted to see Ronaldo bag his second-ever hat-trick for Man Utd in a pulsating five-goal encounter. The veteran quarterback then held conversations with several members of the Red Devils squad post-match, posing for photos before a one-on-one chat with his fellow GOAT. 🐐 x 🐐 @Cristiano 🤝 @TomBrady #MUFC pic.twitter.com/GFTkJ8B84W However, Brady has also spoken of his admiration for Tottenham and England forward Harry Kane, and addressed his hopes that the striker would get on the scoresheet on Saturday, even while he rooted against his side. Here we go! @Cristiano vs. @HKane. I might fist pump if you score Harry but I’m riding with @ManUtd today. pic.twitter.com/ybgHozzSBm But in spite of his long dominance at the top of the NFL, Brady clearly loves an underdog story too, as he did in 2016 when he threw his support behind Leicester City.

6355,Mount finds a new ‘dream team’ as seriously ill children game against Chelsea hero,"While most Premier League players will be enjoying a quiet Christmas Eve with family, Chelsea star Mason Mount is spending the day locked in competitive action. But the England international is not taking to the field on Friday. Instead, he is swapping his football boots for a controller. Mount is giving four families a Christmas Eve they will never forget by taking them on in some festive gaming fun. As patron for Together for Short Lives, a charity that helps the 99,000 seriously ill children and their families across the UK, the 22-year-old midfielder has been joining young gamers for one-on-one matches that have been streamed live on Twitch and YouTube. While Mount has been getting schooled on Mario Kart, the talented midfielder has proven a tough challenger on Mario Party when he and 11-year-old Bethany combine to form a ‘dream team’. He has also turned out to be surprisingly good at Let’s Dance, with his young opponent Ruby telling him to “go on Britain’s Got Talent with moves like that”. Indeed, Mount found the experience more exhausting than he expected, admitting it made him “more tired than playing a whole match!” “I’ve played against some incredible opponents in my career, but today’s are the ultimate VIPs! And they really gave me a run for my money!” Mount said. “It was great to combine two of my passions – gaming and Together for Short Lives. I’m so pleased to have been a part of some special new family memories for the children I met today… even if one of them admitted that he benches me when he plays FIFA! “I hope today’s stream helps to raise vital funds and awareness for this important charity. Happy Holidays.” The lucky kids who will be gaming with Mount are Bethany, who despite having a very serious illness which affects her muscles and energy levels, meaning she uses a wheelchair, doesn’t let anything hold her back. Bethany has even competed in Powerchair football with the England Powerchair Captain, so she relished the chance to challenge another England sporting hero. Her family receive the very best care from The Nook, part of East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices. Like many other boys his age, 14-year-old Ian is mad about sport, but he is unable to play because of his condition called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Ian is really close to his younger brother and gaming partner Joel. The bond between the boys has grown since they lost their dad to Motor Neurone Disease in 2016. Children’s Hospice South West provides lifeline care for them all. There is also Ruby, aged 18, a huge Mason Mount fan, even calls herself ‘Mrs Mount’. She was a young carer to her sister Holly for the whole of their life together. They were best friends and sisters like no other. Sadly, Holly died during the pandemic, leaving the whole family heartbroken. Claire House Children’s Hospice has been there for the whole family throughout Holly’s life and supporting them since she has died. Mum Hayley says their lives would have been ‘very different’ without their hospice. And 16-year-old Abdullah, who was diagnosed with a life-limiting congenital condition – Pompe Disease when he was just two. Abdullah could not go and play with other children or be involved in games like playing football, so from a young age has loved computer gaming instead. He even dreams of working in the gaming industry. Vital care and support from Richard House Children’s Hospice means the world to the whole family. Mount took huge interest in getting to know Bethany, Ian, Ruby and Abdullah, and probed the latter about his ambition of working in the gaming industry. “If you could create your own game what would it be?” Mount asked Abdullah. The teenager excitedly told him all about a new strategy game that he’d call Sharkaron. Mason said: “I love that idea – I hope in the future you can make that happen.” Ruby’s mum Hayley said of the opportunity given to Mount and the children: “Christmas is a very difficult time for us and I am so delighted for Ruby to get a moment of some Christmas magic that is just for her and that I know will truly put a smile on her face that will last a long, long time.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mount-finds-a-new-dream-team-as-seriously-ill-children-game/blta335d8a8bbd7fa16,GOAL,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2609,'Everything will be perfect' - Van Nistelrooy PSV manager appointment praised by Bruma,"PSV winger Bruma has told GOAL that he is excited to see what Ruud van Nistelrooy can achieve when he takes over as coach at the Dutch club next season.  The former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Netherlands international has recently been unveiled as the  new PSV coach.  Van Nistelrooy was one of the finest strikers of his generation, scoring more than 300 goals in a career disrupted by injuries, and PSV will be his first senior role in management. The 45-year-old worked as an assistant to Dick Advocaat when he was in charge of the national team and more recently as part of the PSV youth set-up, where Bruma has heard only good things.  ""Next season we can do well because everything will be perfect for him, for the team, for everybody,"" the Portuguese winger told GOAL.  ""This is the most important thing, I want all the best for him because I like him, he's a very good guy and a good coach.""  PSV are currently four points behind Eredivisie leaders Ajax having built up a strong squad.  As well as the experience of former Germany international Mario Gotze, Bruma has hailed England under-21 international Noni Madueke, who left Tottenham to take a chance on breaking through in the Netherlands.  ""I want him to keep this level and keep working harder because he has everything,"" Bruma added.  ""I have a good connection with him and I want the best for him. When he is happy he plays his best football and we are here to help him.""  Roger Schmidt will leave his post at the end of the season when his contract expires but could yet finish the season with PSV's first title since 2018 and will face leaders Ajax in the Dutch Cup final.  Ahead of that they face Leicester City in the Europa Conference League and Bruma says they know how difficult it will be to win silverware this season.  ""Ajax is a great team, everybody knows this and we've played them three times this season already, so we know it will be tough,"" he said.  ""Leicester is a great team with good players - it's one thing playing teams from the Eredivisie and another playing teams from the Premier League.

3819,Norwich City relegated to Championship as Aston Villa loss seals their fate,"Norwich City's fate has been sealed as the Canaries suffered relegation to the Championship with Saturday's loss to Aston Villa. Dean Smith lost 2-0 to his former club at Villa Park to leave Norwich on the brink of the drop.  A late victory for relegation rivals Burnley made sure the East Anglians would be making an instant return to the second tier following last year's promotion. Smith suffered an unhappy afternoon in his first match back at Villa Park, having been sacked by the Birmingham side earlier in the season.  Goals from Ollie Watkins and Danny Ings sealed a straightforward victory for the hosts, one which all but guarantees them survival after a tough campaign in 2021-22.  Norwich would neverthless have lived on to fight another day had Burnley dropped points to Watford.  Yet despite trailing for more than 70 minutes through James Tarkowski's own goal, the Clarets mounted a late comeback to win 2-1 and send the Canaries down. Watford's defeat also leaves them in grave peril of relegation as the season enters its final stages.  The Hornets are just one point above Norwich on 22, 12 behind Leeds United and Burnley with just four to play.  If either of those take a single point from their final matches or Watford drop any, they will join Norwich in the Championship next year.  Everton currently occupy the final relegation spot in 18th place and trail Leeds and Burnley by five points, albeit with one and two games in hand over their rivals respectively.  The Toffees take on manager Frank Lampard's former club Chelsea on Sunday in a crucial game for their survival prospects.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/norwich-city-relegated-to-championship-as-aston-villa-loss-seals-/blt62eca67e6b2ea953,Daniel Edwards,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

3074,Arsenal set Premier League red card record as Gabriel is given marching orders in Man City defeat,"Arsenal have set a new Premier League record for red cards after seeing Gabriel given his marching orders in their 2-1 defeat to Manchester City. The Gunners welcomed league leaders City to Emirates Stadium on New Year's Day looking to avenge their 5-0 drubbing in Manchester back in August. Mikel Arteta's side went in at half-time 1-0 up thanks to a Bukayo Saka strike, but Riyad Mahrez levelled proceedings from the penalty spot before the hosts were reduced to ten men, making some top-flight history in the process. The Gunners have now become the first side to reach 100 red cards since the formation of the Premier League back in 1992. Gabriel, meanwhile, is the 11th player to have been sent off under Mikel Arteta, which is more than any other club since the Spaniard's appointment in December 2019. Arsenal initially dealt with pressure of having to play the final 30 minutes of their latest domestic outing with just ten men impressively, but conceded a heartbreaking stoppage-time winner from Rodri that ensured City move even further clear at the top of the table. The north London outfit produced a much-improved display against Pep Guardiola's side but have now lost their last ten meetings, which is their longest losing sequence against any side in the division. The final result means Arsenal remain in fourth place on 35 points, four ahead of West Ham in the race for the last Champions League spot having played one game more. Arteta's side will now take in a two-week break from Premier League action before a huge derby encounter against Tottenham on January 16.

3882,"'If we win, we're in the Premier League' - Lampard believes in Everton survival after nine-man Toffees squander lead against Brentford","Everton's Premier League future is in their own hands as the Toffees head into the final games of the league campaign. Frank Lampard's side missed a chance to seal their Premier League futures on Sunday, as they squandered two separate leads and saw two players sent off in a 3-2 loss to Brentford. As a result, it will all come down to the final days of the season as Everton battle for survival. Heading into their final two matches of the season, Everton are on 36 points, two more than 18th-place Burnley and one more than 17th-place Leeds. Leeds have played one more game than Everton and Burnley, with a late goal earning them a 1-1 draw with Brighton that saw Jesse Marsch's side put a point between them and Burnley. Everton, meanwhile, will know that one win in their final two games will be enough to solidify their spot in the Premier League. They'll face Crystal Palace at Goodison Park on Thursday in their penultimate game, with that match likely being their best chance at earning those three points. After that, they'll head to Arsenal for the final game of the season on Sunday, with the Gunners likely needed all three points to seal a Champions League spot. Burnley, meanwhile, visit Aston Villa on Thursday before hosting Newcastle on the final day of the season. ""We knew a win would get us safe,"" Lampard told BBC after the Brentford loss.

""I don't know where Mbappe will end up [this summer], but selling them would be harmful to us. We need to strengthen the team, not weaken it.""Indeed, while the Frenchman is undeniably a world-class striker who would add flair to any team, it would be irrational for the Blaugrana to part ways with two key players from the current squad just to sign him.Besides, Barca's top priority for the upcoming transfer window is a defensive midfielder.

126,"'Pep puts enough pressure on himself' - No rush on new contract for Man City manager, insists chairman Khaldoon","Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak has said there's no rush on getting manager Pep Guardiola to sign a contract extension. Guardiola's current deal runs until the end of next season, and he has said he won't consider a new deal until 2023. Despite winning the Premier League again this term, pressure is mounting on Guardiola to lead Manchester City to a Champions League triumph. ""You don’t need to put any extra pressure on Pep, he puts enough pressure on himself for everyone,"" the chairman told the club website. ""It is the exact opposite I try to bring back the pressure because I think he puts too much pressure on himself. The pressure is not of winning this competition or that competition. We are all in it together.  ""[Owner] Sheikh Mansour looks at the game understands the game and understands winning and losing very very well which is why his ethos, his philosophy I have tried to instil on this organisation and what we have had these last games which is positive constructive forward leaning, always pushing forward.  ""We approach every season to win and to try to win every competition we compete in. That is the mindset that has been the case over the last 10 years. ""We try to win every competition we play and I think part if when you are asking about Pep you cannot argue every competition from the Champions League to the Premier League to the FA Cup. We show up every game with full intention to give it everything we have to win every game. With that you can see the results."" Khaldoon added on Guardiola: ""Pep has never stayed as long as he's stayed here with any club, be it Barcelona or Bayern Munich. So, the question is perfectly valid. ""It is perfectly valid last year and three years ago, and of course this year. It is a partnership that has done wonders in years.  ""It is approaching its seventh year and next year is going to be an exciting chapter of his partnership and we're enjoying every moment of it. We're achieving great things together and this conversation will be had at the right time, at the right pace, and with the pace, time and framework that works for Pep."" The club have already announced the signings of Julian Alvarez and Erling Haaland, but additional incomings are still expected. ""We've been very deliberate over the years in how we freshen up the squad, how we continuously improve the team very deliberately and then how we infuse it with talent from the academy,"" said Khaldoon. ""I can confirm that there will be more players coming in. We are looking to strengthen the team in the areas we need strengthening. ""Every season some players leave and we have to refresh the team. We always look at improving and strengthening. We've made two very important additions already but I anticipate we will be doing a couple more.""

7797,Kane admits Bayern are 'in a difficult spell' but urges them 'to keep fighting',"Harry Kane has issued a rallying cry to his Bayern Munich team-mates after two devastating defeats have left their Bundesliga title and Champions League hopes in jeopardy.  The German giants were beaten 1-0 at Lazio in the Champions League last-16 first-leg on Wednesday night - with defender Dayot Upamecano suspended for the return leg after being shown a straight red card in the second half. That result came four days after they were soundly outplayed at Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga in a 3-0 loss - a result that sees them five points behind their rivals in the German top-flight. Serial winners Bayern - who embarrassingly lost to third-division outfit Saarbrucken in the German Cup - now face the unfamiliar feeling of ending a season trophyless. And reflecting on a nightmare few days, Kane is adamant they can turn around their fortunes.   'Really tough week. In the first half, we started well and had clear chances, one for myself. In these games, they're big moments,' the striker reflected to TNT Sports post-match after defeat at Lazio. 'The second half was disappointing. We came out with less energy and less confidence. We got punished. Once you go down to 10 men it's always difficult. 'We have to find it among ourselves. We're still in the race for the Bundesliga and still in this tie. We have to keep fighting. 'We're in a difficult spell. We have to fight. We have to turn it around. We have big games and big things to fight for. We're not out of it, we will never give up. We just need to turn it around. One game or spark can turn it around.'  Bayern will look to put their Bundesliga title charge back on track on Sunday afternoon when they visit Bochum. After the trip to west Germany, Bayern face Leipzig (February 24) and Freiburg (March 1) before entertaining Lazio in the return leg of the European encounter.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Kane-admits-Bayern-are-in-a-difficult-spell-but-urges-them-to-keep-fighting/3302142,,1 day ago,all-football-app
374,Man Utd & Arsenal-linked Moussa Diaby 'thinking about' summer transfer,"Bayer Leverkusen winger Moussa Diaby says he is considering his options amid reports of interest from other clubs.  The 22-year-old has been linked with the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund recently. While a possible summer transfer is on the France international's mind, he insists he is focused on ensuring Leverkusen have a strong end to the season. Asked if the interest from other clubs has turned his head, Diaby told Sport.de: ""Of course I'm thinking about it. ""But not too much yet. I'm still concentrating on the end of the season."" Leverkusen are currently third in the Bundesliga but are not yet sure of a place in the Champions League, with RB Leipzig, Freiburg and Hoffenheim all within four points of them. Diaby is the team's second-top scorer in the German top flight, having scored 12 goals and registered seven assists in 25 matches. In the Europa League, he netted four times and set up two more goals.

2275,"Liverpool vs Shrewsbury Town: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Shrewsbury Town will be aiming to pull off an FA Cup giant-killing when they travel to Anfield to take on Liverpool in Sunday’s third-round clash. The Shrews took this opposition to a replay when they met in the fourth round back in 2020, coming from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at home before losing out 1-0 on Merseyside. Shrewsbury can now be backed at 11/1 (12.0) with bet365 to exact revenge for that result with a shock win at Anfield. Jurgen Klopp’s men are without a win in four matches but Liverpool remain 1/5 (1.20) favourites to come out on top against their League One opponents. Three of those four winless matches have resulted in draws, and you can get odds of 13/2 (7.50) on them being forced into extra-time after another deadlocked 90 minutes. Diogo Jota is the 11/4 (3.75) favourite to open the scoring after hitting the net 12 times in 24 fixtures this season, with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain the next in line at 5/1 (6.0) in the absence of the usual star names. Ryan Bowman is the visitors' 14/1 (15.0) favourite to break the deadlock, with Birmingham City loanee Sam Cosgrove priced at 16/1 (17.0). Having been forced to postpone Thursday’s Carabao Cup semi-final with Arsenal due to a combination of injuries and Covid-19 cases, it is unclear how many first-team players the Reds will have available for this clash. With Mo Salah, Sadio Mane and Naby Keita also away on international duty, it is safe to say that the home team’s starting line-up is unlikely to have a particularly familiar look to it. This offers a potential opportunity for Steve Cotterill’s team, which come into this game in strong form, unbeaten in four games and having kept three consecutive clean sheets. Given the lack of usual star quality in the Liverpool attack, odds of 4/5 (1.80) seem generous on Shrewsbury keeping the scoreline to under 3.5 goals in a robust display at Anfield. All odds correct at time of writing. Please gamble responsibly.

3999,"Mbappe made right call to stay at PSG and still has time for Real Madrid transfer, says Di Maria","Kylian Mbappe made the right call to stay at Paris Saint-Germain, according to Angel Di Maria, who says the forward still has plenty of time left in his career to seal a transfer to Real Madrid. Mbappe snubbed a move to Santiago Bernabeu to sign a new three-year contract at PSG, and celebrated by scoring a hat-trick in a 5-0 win over Metz on the final day of the Ligue 1 season. Madrid were confident of signing the 23-year-old on a free transfer after he pushed to join the club last summer and have been left stunned by his surprise U-turn, but Di Maria feels he has taken the right decision for his career. ""I think he has made the right decision,"" the Argentine winger, who played for Madrid between 2010 and 2014, told reporters after the Metz game. ""He is still young and has time to go to Madrid, he has time to go wherever he wants, he has only signed three more years and he will be 26, he has a lot ahead of him. ""He likes to make history and he will continue to make history here, he is close to 200 goals."" Asked if he can see Mbappe joining Madrid in 2025, Di Maria replied: ""I don't know, the people at Madrid are complicated, the Bernabeu is difficult, but he has the talent to win them over."" Di Maria also got on the scoresheet against Metz in his last ever appearance for PSG, who have confirmed that his contract will not be extended beyond the summer. The 34-year-old wanted to stay put for one more year to help the club clinch a maiden Champions League crown, but he doesn't hold any resentment. ""The club knew that I wanted to stay and do another year to achieve the goal set when I arrived, which is to win the Champions League,"" he said. ""We were very close playing a final. It's the only thing I regret. I know the guys will continue on the same path and try to win it. My decision was to stay, they told me no, but today I am calm."" GOAL has reported that Di Maria will now move on to a new challenge at Juventus after agreeing on a one-year deal at Allianz Stadium, but he refused to confirm his next move. ""For now I'm going to keep quiet and think a little more about my family and myself and see what's best for me and my family, and then find a place where we'll be happy and quiet,"" he said.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mbappe-stay-psg-real-madrid-transfer-di-maria/blt8152e00c5632ab36,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7967,Hodgson insists Crystal Palace can come through 'bad period' after Blues defeat,"Roy Hodgson insisted he can steer Crystal Palace away from the Premier Leagueâs relegation zone despite Chelseaâs late, late show piling the pressure on the 76-year-old manager.  Jefferson Lermaâs swerving screamer handed Palace the lead but Conor Gallagher equalised before Mauricio Pochettinoâs men scored twice in stoppage time â first through Gallagher and then Enzo Fernandez as they silenced Selhurst Park. On a night when Palace's supporters showed their frustration towards the clubâs hierarchy with banners branding them âweakâ, Hodgson said he felt their pain after this defeat. âIt's a bad period,â said Hodgson who faces Premier League matches against Everton and Burnley next.â There are 14 games. A lot of games. A lot of points. We've shown enough, even in some of the other defeats we've had. I don't have any concerns in that respect. âBut I do want to emphasise that there is no complacency. We realise we are at the wrong end of the table. We realise points are necessary to climb away from the relegation zone. âIf the question is, do I think this group of players are good enough to get us out of this? I do. They've shown a lot tonight which gives me even more faith and belief that they'll get there.â Hodgson added: 'I feel extremely sorry for them because to go home and sleep on that defeat is going to be very tough for everybody. The fans were very good throughout. They must be gutted because, like me at 85 minutes, I was not thinking we are going to lose this game.â Chelsea did consider selling Gallagher in January but much to his managerâs relief, he stayed. 'Always he decided, what he told me, was to stay at Chelsea,â Pochettino said, before being asked if he should be tied down to a new deal.   'It is about him and the club,' the Blues boss added. 'I am not suffering from this type of thing. He still has one year more on his contract (expires June 2025). That is a matter for him and the club.â Chelsea have bounced back since being hammered at home by Wolves â a defeat which put Pochettino under pressure. Since then, they have beaten Aston Villa in the FA Cup and Palace here. âI don't care about the rumours, the tension, the pressure or the stresses,â Pochettino said. 'We know really well what is our reality and we are going to keep working.â",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Hodgson-insists-Crystal-Palace-can-come-through-bad-period-after-Blues-defeat/3301136,,13-Feb,all-football-app
3167,FIFA slammed for playing Peru vs Australia World Cup qualifier in summer Qatar heat,"Peru assistant coach Nobby Solano has criticised FIFA for making the country and Australia play their World Cup qualifying play-off in Qatar. The two sides will go head-to-head in Al Rayyan to decide who will go through to the tournament in Qatar later this year. Solano has slammed the decision, highlighting that the World Cup was moved from the summer to November because it was decided the conditions would not be safe for the players. “The game is kicking off at nine o’clock and they’re saying that the stadium is air-conditioned, so it will be fresh when we play,” he said, according to inews. “But we’ve been training in Spain until this weekend because it’s just too hot to train in Qatar during the day. “We’re being asked to play in the same conditions that it was decided that the World Cup wouldn’t be possible to be played in. “For a game of this size, with so much at stake, I’m not sure that’s really good for either us or Australia. Although it’s obviously the same for both teams.” The decision to allow Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup has been a controversial topic since the announcement was first made. The country's human rights record, treatment of LGBTQ+ people and alleged abuse of migrant workers building the stadiums have all been criticised in recent years. German football's managing director Olver Bierhoff criticised the country this week, saying: ""Such treatment of homosexuals is absolutely unacceptable. It in no way corresponds to my views. ""What award criteria for a World Cup does FIFA actually apply? Because awarding a tournament is the sharpest sword to push for the necessary change."" Human rights organisation Amnesty International published a report into the working conditions linked to the World Cup, claiming that many are being put through “forced labour”. Netherlands boss Louis van Gaal hit out at FIFA for giving the tournament to Qatar, saying: ""It's about money, about commercial interests. That matters in FIFA.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fifa-slammed-for-playing-peru-vs-australia-world-cup/blt51b9be7fd4d548a1,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6496,Eriksen steps up Premier League return with two assists in Brentford friendly as on-loan Man Utd youngster Amad Diallo strikes twice for Rangers,"Brentford star Christian Eriksen has gotten a step closer to a Premier League return after featuring in a friendly with Rangers on Monday afternoon. The Dane hasn't played competitively since collapsing at the Euros and was subsequently released by Inter. After Eriksen was given the all-clear by his doctors, he opted to return to England, with the London club picking him up on a free transfer. Eriksen played for nearly 80 minutes in the 2-2 draw and was instrumental, providing two crucial assists vs the Scottish opponents. The friendly was played behind closed doors at The Gers' training ground, with Zanka and Tristan Crama netting the goals for Brentford. Eriksen's first assist came from a corner in which he delivered a pin-point cross for Zanka to head into the net from close range. Rangers hit back with their own equaliser through Amad Diallo, who later scored a second after reacting quickest to a saved penalty. Eriksen's set-piece delivery was on show again in the second-half when he helped his team draw level from a free-kick, crossing well to Crama who helped pull the scores level. The former Ajax man also grabbed an assist in last week's friendly against Southend in which he featured for around an hour. On the 12th of June 2021, Eriksen collapsed on the pitch after suffering from a cardiac arrest in Denmark's opening game of the Euros. Quick medical care and assistance from his team-mates meant that the midfielder luckily didn't suffer any permanent damage and was stabilised. He was later fitted with a defibrillator to manage rhythm disturbances in his heart but it meant his time with Inter was over as the Serie A has rules against such medical devices. The Premier League has no similar rule, allowing Brentford to sign him, with the Bees currently helping him back to match fitness.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/eriksen-steps-up-premier-league-return-with-two-assists-in/blt29c8279e215c17d1,Marwan Harraz,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8503,Paul Merson says: Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund will be a superstar,"In his latest column, Sky Sports' Paul Merson looks back at wins for Man Utd and Arsenal on Super Sunday, and says striker Rasmus Hojlund has the potential to be a superstar at Old Trafford I like him. He's a young kid, he's 21 and playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world. If there was one thing you could bottle up in football, you ask anyone, it's confidence. He's got confidence now and football is all about confidence. He holds the ball up well and lays it off well to the wingers. You start to get into the game a lot more and the confidence rises. Those chances keep coming and you start to take them. In those first 10 games, when he was going without a goal, he was snatching at everything. And he's got it. If that ball [for Hojlund's opening goal] at Villa comes in at the start of the season, he would've hit it as hard as he could. But he places it under the goalkeeper.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Harry Maguire was named player of the match for United against Villa. It was a good performance and I'm pleased for him. He's a worker and he puts his body on the line. If I was playing, he's the type of player you'd want in your team. However, there's a thin line between centre-backs doing well and not doing well. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Aston Villa created so many chances and if they take some of them we are having a different conversation. Villa could have scored four and then we are talking about a poor day for that United back four. That's how quickly things can change in football. However it was Maguire and United's day. He's a threat in both boxes and what I like is that when he is up for a corner he tries to score and have an effect on the game. A lot of defenders just go up and go through the motions. They are only up because the manager told them to go up. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Man Utd are on a good run and have a good run of fixtures coming up, but they will have to keep winning games. Tottenham also have good fixtures coming up as this race for the Champions League starts to get interesting. But like with Hojlund, Man Utd are now full of confidence. Hojlund is scoring goals now, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho are threats on the wing. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  I still think their game-management is poor. There are still moments when they are giving the ball away so cheaply and making the wrong decisions, and it did catch up with them as Villa piled on some continuous pressure. When they can learn that side of the game United will be a much better team. They are always going to score goals with Hojlund, Rashford and Garnacho. They just need to keep things tight at the back because for me, it will be very rare if they come off pitches between now and the end of the season without goals. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Aston Villa played really well against Man Utd, but they still came out on the losing side. That is a little bit of worry. Villa created so many chances. If they create that many in another game they probably get all three points. Villa will be disappointed. You can take it when you don't play well and lose, it's just one of those things, but there is nothing worse than playing well and losing football matches. Their last five fixtures haven't been the easiest. Everton is a hard place to go, on their day Newcastle can beat anyone, Chelsea were going to click one day and then there's United. It's not like Villa have played four teams at the bottom. They have played decent teams and just haven't got the results. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The name of the game now for Villa is to get back on the horse, win their next game and go again. They've got to get back to winning ways quickly. When you are winning week in, week out the players and the fans would have been turning up expecting to win with their 13th, 14th and so on victory on the trot at home. But all of a sudden, Newcastle did a job on them. Then Chelsea wiped the floor with them and now United have won. It did get nervy at the end of the game for Villa. They have got to get back to winning ways quickly. They are where they are in this league because of their home record and they've got to get winning again at Villa Park. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Arsenal are now putting their chances away and working hard If you want to win the Premier League, you have to bounce back [from defeats] as quickly as you can and they have done that.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  We've still got a little bit to go before we get to the serious business of the run-in. That all starts with eight games to go in my opinion. Then we get to back to the importance of which team plays first on the weekend. It plays a huge part, in my opinion. Arsenal had to win at West Ham just to stay where they are. It takes its toll. We saw it a few years ago now with Spurs when they were chasing Leicester. They kept playing second. Talk to Tiger Woods about matchplay. He wants to put his ball on the green first to build the pressure on his opponent. It makes a huge difference.

Not getting tight to the Arsenal players, showing them inside on to their proper foot, it is poor.

There is ways of losing football matches, that is a horrible way and I feel sorry for David Moyes as that is not a Moyes team out there, they have let him down today.

11068,Should Liverpool Really Take Salah off Penalties?,"Mohamed Salah has missed his last two penalties for Liverpool. There’s never a great time to miss one, but it hasn’t helped that they’ve both come in games Liverpool haven’t won – defeat against Bournemouth and a pulsating 2-2 draw to Arsenal. But should Liverpool really be thinking about swapping him out? Recency bias is a well-documented phenomenon. It’s the tendency – in all walks of life – to overweight recent events or trends and ignore long-term evidence. Given how outcome-driven the world of sports is, it’s an industry that is particularly susceptible of falling into this trap. So, while it’s an indisputable fact Mohamed Salah has missed his last two penalties for Liverpool, the fact that they’ve been back-to-back misses, and have come in the midst of a down year for the Reds can compound how “bad” the situation really is. Since arriving on Merseyside, Salah has scored 24 of the 29 penalties he’s taken in all competitions for Liverpool, for an average conversion rate of 82.8%. He actually missed the first one he ever took for the club, against Huddersfield Town in October 2017, but quickly shrugged off that miss to rattle off 17 in a row in all competitions – including a high-pressure penalty in the final of the Champions League against Tottenham. His most recent miss before the Bournemouth game came in another match Liverpool went on to lose (vs. Leicester in December 2021), but Salah had scored game-winning penalties in his two attempts prior to that game (against Aston Villa and Atletico Madrid), while he scored three consecutive penalties in 2020-21 (vs. Fulham, Man City and Chelsea) in matches Liverpool were losing and his penalty brought them level. He’s long been the club’s reliable spot-kick taker. But just how good is a penalty conversion rate of 82.8%? Well, for starters, it’s better than the average in each of the top five leagues this season: But ‘above average’ feels like a fairly low threshold to meet. It’s great and all, but ideally we want our penalty takers to be elite. So how does Salah’s record stack up with the best of the best over the last decade? Since the start of the 2010-11 season, 349 players have taken 10 or more penalties across the top 6 European leagues, the Championship and major cup competitions (FA Cup, League Cup, Champions League). At one point or another, these players were ‘regular’ penalty takers. Across that timeframe, those 349 players took 6,868 spot-kicks and converted 5,567 of them for a conversion rate of 81.1%. That’s lower than Salah’s average of 82.8%. That’s a good start. And over that period of time, the Egyptian has a better record than the likes of Ciro Immobile (53/65 – 81.5%), Kylian Mbappe (16/20 – 80%), Lionel Messi (69/87 – 79.3%), Sergio Aguero (49/62 – 79.0%), Frank Lampard (29/37 – 78.4%) and even dead-ball specialist James Ward-Prowse (14/19 – 73.7%). Interesting. Now, there are of course players with better records than Salah. Given the volume of penalties he’s taken since 2010-11, Cristiano Ronaldo’s record of 103 from 120 (85.8%) is exceptional. Similarly, Harry Kane’s 41 from 48 (85.4%) is excellent. There are those who have mastered the stuttered run up. Ivan Toney (23/24 – 95.8%), Jorginho (35/40, 87.5%) and Bruno Fernandes (39/43 – 90.7%) each have brilliant records. But that’s fine – those are exceptional records from penalty specialists. When compared to the wider footballing world, Salah’s record from the spot stacks up respectably. All the while, he’s been scoring buckets full of goals and is now Liverpool’s all-time Premier League scorer. For the most part, you’d be very happy as him being your primary penalty taker. All this talk about removing him from penalty-taking duties might seem overblown then and that Jürgen Klopp’s hints that it’s “something he’ll talk about” with Salah – although we appreciate that’s just one line from a press conference – as unneeded. But once you get further down the list of penalty takers, two names jump off the page. Fabinho: 23 penalties taken. 22 penalties scored. 95.7%. James Milner: 23 penalties taken. 21 penalties scored. 91.3%. Both are in Klopp’s squad. Both have outstanding penalty records. Virgil van Dijk even said last year on Gary Neville’s The Overlap that if someone had to take a penalty to save his life, he’d pick Milner. Players miss penalties. Harry Kane and Ivan Toney have done so recently. But Fabinho and Milner have proven over a decent sample size that they miss them a whole lot less than others. Given Milner’s limited game time, you’d have thought Fabinho would be the next man up. Maybe it is time to make the change – not because Salah’s record is bad – but because the Brazilian’s is extraordinary. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

Arsenal were the dominant attacking side throughout the Premier League match, but failed to get the decisive blow, much to the manager's frustration. The north London team made 20 attempts at goal against Burnley. According to Opta, it is the most Arsenal have had at home in the Premier League without scoring in the last six seasons. Arteta's men have now failed to score in four games in a row for the first time since December 2005. Their only goal so far in January came in the New Year's day clash against Manchester City, which they lost 2-1.   Arteta was disappointed by the way his team started the match against Burnley, but feels they did everything they could to break the deadlock. He told Match of the Day: ""We started slow, we looked leggy and didn't have enough rhythm or intention to attack the way we wanted. We started to play better, more rhythm and threat and came out in the second half completely different. ""We tried in every different way but lacked the quality in the final third. At the end, when we have a really low block, you need spark and creativity to win football matches and today we didn't do that.  ""It is what they do, they want to play a slow game, it takes long, it is their game and you have to respect that.  ""We need to start scoring goals and get back the players, the last four weeks it has been extremely difficult to put training sessions and squads together because of the amount of Covid-19 and injuries.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arteta-on-arsenal-s-disastrous-january-we-need-to-start/blt88464ed0398227e8,By Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8475,Sheffield Wednesday 2-0 Birmingham City: Ike Ugbo scores twice to give Owls' survival hopes much-needed boost,"Sheffield Wednesday gave their dwindling survival hopes a shot in the arm on Friday night as they earned a deserved 2-0 win over Birmingham. Ike Ugbo scored his first goal since joining the Owls on loan from Troyes in January to put Danny Rohl's side in front against the run of play at Hillsborough. The Canada international doubled his tally and the hosts' lead early on in the second half with the decisive touch on a cross from Marvin Johnson. Birmingham - who have now won just one of their last nine league games - racked up a total of 25 shots, but could not find a way past England U20 goalkeeper James Beadle. They stay four points above the bottom three, but firmly in the relegation conversation with 16 games still to play, while Wednesday climb to within five points of safety after their first win since New Year's Day and just their seventh all season. Birmingham were on top from the off and had fashioned four chances inside the first 15 minutes so - given the predictable unpredictability of the Championship - it came as little surprise when Wednesday instead took the lead. Leeds loanee Ian Poveda collected the ball on the right flank, showed neat footwork to lose his man and laid the ball on a plate for Ugbo to guide home the opener against the run of play after 16 minutes How Sheffield Wednesday and Birmingham lined up Match stats LIVE Championship table Stream Sky Sports with NOW Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Birmingham kept the chances coming, though, and created an xG figure of 1.01 from 12 shots; Wednesday were living dangerously at the back at times, but trying to beat Beadle became an arduous task. In fact, Poveda and Ugbo each had a chance to extend the Owls' lead before the break, but both fired wide. The hosts' fight did not decrease after the break and they doubled their lead on 53 minutes, when Johnson was afforded time to lift an inviting ball to the far post, where Ugbo leapt above Lee Buchanan to head in. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tony Mowbray's side did manage to create chances after that; Buchanan's sweet strike hit the side netting, before Jordan James ran into traffic and bent a shot just wide of the right-hand post. Ultimately, they faded as the second half progressed. When eight minutes were added on by the fourth official, the Blues momentarily upped their game. Seung-Ho Paik forced a strong save from Beadle and Juninho Bacuna hit a bouncing ball wide, but there was to be no reward.

""It was important, in our situation, it is just one game with three points and there are 15 games. We have to go. ""I am not speaking about momentum, I am speaking about three points, for me it was a first cup final.

11175,Ranked: Which Clubs Would Make the Cut for a New European Super League?,"The organisers of the European Super League (ESL) recently announced a fresh set of new proposals. The new plans would expand the ESL to contain 60 to 80 teams, with each side guaranteed a minimum of 14 matches per season while continuing to play in their domestic leagues. Regardless of whether the proposals gain any traction, it does beg an interesting thought experiment. Let’s assume the ESL expands to 80 teams. Based solely on merit alone who would qualify? Who are the top 80 clubs in Europe? In the past, this would’ve been a difficult question to answer. But now, our Opta Power Rankings can give you the definitive data-led list. Let’s start with Europe’s top five leagues: If the ESL were to be decided by our Power Rankings, then the Premier League would make up 15 of the 80 teams. Of teams currently in the Premier League, only Leeds, Everton, Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth and Southampton would miss out. Germany would provide the next most teams with 12, while Spain would provide nine from La Liga with eight teams from both Italy and France qualifying. Overall, teams from Europe’s top five leagues would make up 65% (52 out of 80) of the ESL. Elsewhere, Portugal and the Netherlands would supply four each, with Belgium providing three. The big two in Scotland – Celtic and Rangers – would qualify, while Norway and Serbia would be the remaining two countries to provide more than one team. The rest of the nations would offer just one. As a reminder, Opta’s Power Rankings is a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score between 0 and 100 to nearly 13,500 domestic football teams in the world. The 80 teams above are the ones with the highest ability score – simple.   Enjoy this? Subscribe to our newsletter to receive five stories each Friday. It’s free.

9584,Andre Onana keeps Man United clean sheet after well over a month,"Andre Onana kept a clean sheet to help Manchester United comfortably beat West Ham United 3-0 at Old Trafford. He made a great save in the first half to deny Edson Alvarez followed by a couple more nervy saves as the game went on. It was an encouraging performance from Onana, who has been ridiculed to no end this season. The Cameroonian last kept a clean sheet for Man United in the Premier League back on December 17, in the 0-0 draw with Liverpool. That was his sixth clean sheet of the season. And finally, over a month later, Onana has now claimed a seventh one, much to the delight of the Old Trafford faithful.

7154,Asamoah Gyan: Former Sunderland ace reveals Suarez assault thoughts vs Liverpool,"Former Sunderland striker Asamoah Gyan has revealed he once considered physically assaulting then Liverpool attacker Luis Suarez as payback for Ghana’s 2010 World Cup heartbreak at a Premier League game. The two men are remembered for their parts in unarguably one of the most memorable matches in World Cup history when Ghana met Uruguay in the quarter-final of the global showpiece in South Africa, the first World Cup to be hosted in Africa.  With the score at 1-1 in extra-time, Ghana almost scored a dramatic last-gasp winner but for Suarez, who handled a goal-bound Dominic Adiyiah header, conceding a red card and a penalty which Gyan struck against the woodwork before the South Americans went on to clinch a 4-2 penalty shoot-out victory.   “I remember a game between Sunderland and Liverpool. We were playing at home on that day and all players were shaking hands. I wanted to hit him [Suarez] because people had said things that stuck in my mind,” Gyan, currently unattached, told Peace FM on Monday. “I was naïve at that time but when I thought about it later, I realized that I had to let it go because I would have done the same thing if I was in his position.” Had Suarez not handled or Gyan scored the resulting penalty, Ghana would likely have won the game to become the first African nation to reach the semi-final of the World Cup. At the time of the World Cup, Suarez and Gyan were on the books of Ajax and Stade Rennes, respectively, before securing transfers to Liverpool and then Premier League side Sunderland.  In 2012, the Ghanaian went on to become captain of the Black Stars, leading the side to the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations final where they lost to Cote d’Ivoire on penalties, a shoot-out the striker watched from the sidelines. “As captain [of the Black Stars], I’ll say it [my biggest regret] was in 2015 [Afcon] when I asked to be substituted against Ivory Coast in the final,” Gyan said. “I feel like if I was not substituted, I could’ve helped in the penalty shoot-out. But due to some things that were going on, I felt I needed to give the chance to another player. “This was because I had excused myself from taking penalties. But there were a lot of things going on which led to me asking to be substituted. So, I say that was one of my biggest regrets as a captain.” Gyan is Ghana’s all-time top scorer and most capped player in history.

3084,"Mexico star Herrera's MLS transfer arrival to add intensity to Dynamo-Dallas rivalry, says Estevez","Hector Herrera's transfer to MLS will add intensity to the rivalry between the Houston Dynamo and FC Dallas, according to the head coach of the latter club Nico Esteve. Houston announced Herrera as a Designated Player signing at the start of March, and the Mexico international is now eligible to make his debut for the club after leaving Atletico Madrid upon the expiration of his contract on June 30. The 32-year-old played at the highest level of European football in both La Liga and the Champions League during his three years with Atletico, and Estevez feels his arrival in MLS is another strong indication of how quickly the the profile of the competition is growing. Dallas are six points clear of their Texas rivals in the Western Conference after 18 games, and will have the chance to pull even further clear when the two sides meet at the PNC Stadium this weekend. Herrera is all set to take his bow for Houston, and Estevez says the inclusion of such a high-profile player will help to fire up his squad for the derby clash. At long last, for the first time @PNCStadium...Welcome home, @HHerreramex. pic.twitter.com/SQLmxjDXYH ""This league is growing and you can see not only Houston, other teams are bringing good players to the league, and this is great,"" The Dallas boss told a pre-match press conference. ""This is another motivation, to play against a team that has acquired a player that has been good in Europe and with the [Mexico] national team. ""And for us, it's another excitement, more motivation to do a great game against teams that have good players, because we also believe we have good players. We just want to match ourselves against the best and it just gives us motivation to do the best we can."" Estevez acknowledges the extra emotional weight that fixtures against Houston carry for his team, who ran out 2-1 winners when they last met at the Toyota Stadium on April 23. He knows that tensions will likely boil over at times, especially given the fact that the unforgiving Texas sun will be beaming down on the pitch to test the players' endurance levels to the limit, but he expects his squad to be ready for the challenge. ""It means more for us, the players, the club, the fans. And I think that energy you can see in the games,"" said Estevez. ""For sure it's going to be hectic at the beginning, both teams trying to impose their style, trying to impose to their fans and trying to force the mistake of the opponent. ""But as the game settles I think because of the heat everything will calm down and it's something we're learning also here, how difficult it is to play with the heat. ""But I don't have any doubt that it's going to be emotional for moments, it's going to be hectic and there's going to be chaos. This is how we have to deal with those type of games.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mexico-star-herrera-mls-transfer-dynamo-dallas-rivalry-says/blt286ab887962e5a7a,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10630,Do Chelsea Have Reasons for Optimism?,"Chelsea have won just one of their first five games this season. On the surface, much looks bleak, but in reality there are some causes for optimism. Stamford Bridge has seen several new eras begin over the last 16 months or so, but as with the other false dawns that followed Todd Boehly’s acquisition of the club in 2022, this latest episode is taking a little longer than many expected to yield excitement for fans. Mauricio Pochettino’s arrival as head coach was seen as something of a statement, and of course, the club threw money around like it was no object once again in the transfer market. But, after five games of the 2023-24 season, Chelsea are 14th in the Premier League with just one win to show for their efforts. Sunday’s 0-0 draw away to winless Bournemouth – the first goalless match of the 2023-24 Premier League season – led to boos from the travelling supporters, highlighting how the pressure is already on and fan morale is plummeting fast. Nevertheless, amid the fury and frustration, there are glimmers of hope. Chelsea’s biggest problem has been putting the ball in the net – and that’s by no means an issue isolated to 2023-24. In 2022-23, their 38 goals scored was the club’s fewest in a Premier League season. In fact, it was their worst total in a top-flight campaign this century by 20 (58 in 2020-21). There’s been little to suggest they’ve remedied that yet, managing five goals in as many matches; that’s their fewest after five games of a league season since 1995-96 (5), when they finished 11th, and it’s a better total than just four teams in the Premier League, three of which are in the relegation zone. And yet, Chelsea are one of just six Premier League teams with over 10 (10.1) expected goals (xG) this term, and they rank joint-fourth for the most shots (81) with Liverpool. According to our model, this makes Chelsea the second-most wasteful team in the Premier League in 2023-24 with a -5.1 difference between their xG and goals scored. Only Everton (-5.4) are struggling more in front of goal. Chelsea’s shot conversion of 6.2% is also among the worst records in the top tier; Everton (3%) and Luton Town (4.7%) are the two teams worse off here. Clearly, it’s not a great situation to be in, but there’s no doubt Chelsea are creating opportunities, and Sunday’s draw was a good example of this; chances, particularly in the first half, flowed for Pochettino’s side, they just weren’t clinical. Obviously not scoring isn’t a ‘good’ thing, but it’s certainly better to be creating decent chances than to not be crafting anything, even if you are ultimately wasting them. Whether their fortunes in this respect change for the better seemingly depends on the output of one player in particular… With Romelu Lukaku not trusted (and loaned back to Serie A again), Christopher Nkunku suffering a pre-season injury that ruled him out until December and Armando Broja also crocked, Nicolas Jackson quickly found himself burdened with huge responsibility as Chelsea’s first-choice striker. It’s another reminder of just how quickly the 22-year-old’s career has progressed. He only made his first start in any of Europe’s top five leagues in August 2022 for Villarreal, and 10 of his 12 La Liga goals last season were scored in 2023. Jackson was still turning out for Villarreal’s reserve team in Spain’s third tier as recently June 2022. The Gambia-born Senegal international came on leaps and bounds last term, and although still rough around the edges, his form in the second half of the 2022-23 campaign showed real potential. He possessed electric pace, scored goals, was technically impressive and looked very clever with respect to how he linked up with teammates in attack. Much of that’s been on show at Chelsea, but he is struggling in front of goal. Jackson’s one of eight Chelsea players to start all five league games for the club this season, but he’s scored just a single goal from 3.3 xG (excluding penalties), with that difference of 2.3 being the second worst in the division behind Ollie Watkins. Only Erling Haaland (5.6) has accumulated more non-penalty xG than Jackson. Unsurprisingly, that also translates to Haaland (13) being the sole Premier League player presented with more big chances – defined as an opportunity a player would be expected to convert – than Jackson (seven). However, the Chelsea man has failed to score six of them (85.7%); among players with at least three big chances this season, only Marcus Rashford (100% of three) and Watkins (100% of five) have been more wasteful from such scenarios. It’s obviously impossible to know if Jackson will become more clinical, but he’s finding himself in good positions, his teammates are managing to pick him out fairly frequently, and generally his performances have been quite promising. As a link player in attack, he’s often shown real quality. This was on display several times against Bournemouth alone on Sunday, and his 71 off-the-ball runs into the penalty area this season is the most of any player. He’s lively, persistent and getting into good areas; he now just needs to be consistent. If he can improve in that respect, Chelsea could have a serious talent on their hands. Obviously failing to take your chances is a surefire way of failing to meet expectations, but clearly Chelsea’s situation hasn’t been helped by the sheer number of players they have missing. Pochettino was without 12 players due to injury or illness on Sunday, with several of them being either key players or recent big-money signings (granted, there are plenty of these in the squad!). Among those absent were Reece James, Benoit Badiashile, Moisés Caicedo, Roméo Lavia and Nkunku. Even though neither Lavia nor Nkunku have played for the club yet, you could make a case that all five of those would start if fit, maybe some of the others as well, such as Wesley Fofana. “If you don’t win, it’s normal that the fans are not happy, but what I can tell the fans is the circumstance, which we cannot change,” Pochettino told reporters after the Bournemouth game. “The reality, we cannot change. We have too many players [absent]. Of course, we are a team that will be strong if we are all together. Even Manchester City, Arsenal, all the teams; with normal circumstances, with all the squad fit, of course you can compete for everything. Why is it different for us?” Their list of absentees led to Lesley Ugochukwu making his full debut on Sunday, and that made him the 37th different player to start for Chelsea in the Premier League in 2023 – that’s eight more than any other club who have been in the top tier for the full year to date. With that and their injury issues in mind, it’s understandable many have identified a lack of cohesion as a major problem at Chelsea, but the flipside is that they have a lot of quality waiting to return. Whether Pochettino has the clarity and decisiveness to identify a first-choice XI that best fits how he wants the team to play when everyone’s back is another matter. However, with regards to the sheer talent, it’s difficult to imagine them not improving somewhat as their treatment room empties. Ever since Boehly took the reins from Roman Abramovich, Chelsea’s activity in the transfer market has resembled that of a kid playing Football Manager after discovering the in-game editing tool; money’s no longer an object and the possibility of filling a starting line-up with 11 ‘Wonderkids’ becomes very real. After all, potential is great, and everyone loves to see a young player enjoy a breakthrough at the top level. From Chelsea’s perspective, clearly they feel they can build a squad that will dominate in future seasons, otherwise they’d not be dedicating so much money – and such long contracts – to such a strategy. Of course, last season was disappointing and the start to 2023-24 has been underwhelming, but it’s a very young squad that’s still being moulded. For instance, the substitute benches with the youngest averages ages this term have both belonged to Chelsea (21y, 54 days versus Bournemouth, and 20y, 318 days versus Luton). Clearly their injury list had an impact on that, though there’s no doubt it’s a youthful squad; the average age of their starting XI this season is 25 years and four days, making it the fourth youngest in the division; Thiago Silva, who turns 39 on Friday, obviously brings that number up quite a lot. Among those with younger average ages in 2023-24 are Arsenal (24y, 198d) and Tottenham (24y, 345d), both of whom have started the season well. Being a young team doesn’t have to be a hindrance in itself; at least they’re more likely to show long-term improvement than a side with an average age of 29. Enjoy this?

5043,"£1 billion on transfers, zero titles: Woodward's Man Utd era ends in abject failure","If Ed Woodward was to have his time as executive vice chairman again, there are quite a few things he would do differently.  That’s hardly surprising, of course, given Manchester United failed to win a single Premier League title during his eight-and-a-half years in charge and, in truth, never really come close to finishing top of the pile.  In terms of trophies won on Woodward's watch, there has been a Europa League, an FA Cup and a League Cup. But they didn't sustain a single title challenge in the Premier League and became also-rans in the Champions League.  This poor return means that when he walks out of his Mayfair office for the final time at the end of this month, he will do so with a feeling of regret that he failed to achieve what he had set out to do when he was appointed in 2013.  Looking back now, Woodward never recovered from his first summer transfer window.  At the time, David Gill had just quit United and Woodward had agreed to step up to fill the void but, unbeknownst to him, legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson was planning to leave as well.  Woodward admits that the Scot's shock departure made the start of his tenure incredibly challenging and he was devastated he didn’t get to work alongside a man he believes to be ""a genius"". He certainly could have done with Ferguson's help during those first few months, when a lot of fans lost faith in him. When he left the club's tour of Australia to conclude some ""urgent transfer business"" ahead of the start of the 2013-14 campaign, the supporters thought that at least one big-name signing was about to rock up at Old Trafford. Instead, only Marouane Fellaini arrived through the door on deadline day. It was a dreadfully underwhelming deal that came to shape how he was perceived.  Indeed, given that his background was in investment banking rather than football, Woodward quickly became a scapegoat for every poor transfer that United made, and there have been quite a few. The 50-year-old privately admits that his tenure will be remembered as a failure due to the club’s inability to win major trophies and he believes that it comes down to one main thing: poor recruitment.  He failed to land the right managers at the right time, and he failed to sign the right players at the right time.  The fact his last appointment was an interim who had been manager of sport and development at Lokomotiv Moscow says everything you need to know about the succession planning at the club.  Ralf Rangnick, the club insist, was always first choice to succeed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer until the end of the current campaign, but had better decisions been made before then, the club would not have found themselves in such a desperate position, needing a quick fix to a long-time problem. Woodward privately admits that had United made different managerial decisions, then they may have won that elusive 21st league title.  He is a keen admirer of Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp, and the latter was available during his time as CEO. Club sources describe ""sliding doors moments"" that meant the circumstances never fully aligned to get some of the world’s top coaches to Old Trafford, but no attempt was made to hire Antonio Conte, for example. Still, if he deserves a significant share of the blame for not appointing the right bosses, United's player recruitment woes are not all his fault. When Ferguson left, a lot needed to change. Ferguson and Gill were the glue that held the club together. They were the duo that got everything done, so both leaving at the same time rocked Old Trafford to its core. There is admission from within the club that David Moyes was set up to fail because the structure wasn’t there to support him.  Then there was Louis van Gaal. Woodward concedes that the Dutchman was given too much autonomy when it came to signing players. The Dutchman was culpable for signing some of the biggest flops of the post-Ferguson era: Angel Di Maria (£67.5m), Marcos Rojo (£16m), Memphis Depay (£30.6m), Morgan Schneiderlin (£31.5m) and Anthony Martial (£54m).  In terms of transfers, Woodward had hoped for a success rate of 70 per cent, but he admitted that during the Moyes and Van Gaal eras only three out of every 10 deals were working out. United spent big money under Mourinho too, bringing in the likes of Romelu Lukaku (£76m), Paul Pogba (£89m), Fred (£47m) and Henrikh Mkhitaryan (£30m) to name but a few bad buys.  The primary issue with the majority of the names brought in before Solskjaer's appointment was that there appeared to be no method to the madness of their spending. For the main part, United have since tried to invest in exciting young English talent, but the fact remains that over £1 billion has been spent during Woodward’s reign and yet the team is now miles behind the likes of Manchester City and Liverpool. And Woodward has held his hands up and confessed that United will be dealing with the repercussions of their poor transfer dealings for years to come. They are struggling to offload overpaid, sub-standard players, leaving them with a bloated squad that is not good enough to compete for major titles.  However, it is understood that Woodward wishes he had made it clear that he was not the sole person responsible for signing players at United, believing it would have spared him some of the vitriol that has been aimed at him and his family in recent years. It's certainly telling that it has already been made clear that incoming CEO Richard Arnold will have a more hands-off approach when it comes to football matters.  However, when it comes to United's involvement in the Super League fiasco, which led to Woodward's departure, he has nobody to blame but himself. He was one of the driving forces behind the attempted breakaway, along with Juventus president Andrea Agnelli. Woodward had been involved in talks over a closed-off competition for Europe's elite clubs for two years but when it quickly fell apart, he said that he did not agree with the final format and ""had no option"" but to withdraw his support. It was the final straw as far as the fans were concerned. For years, they had questioned Woodward’s lack of football knowledge, so his key role in the project confirmed their worst suspicions as far as they were concerned.   Woodward admits that he has made several mistakes, but he believes that there have been a number of notable success stories. His focus on commercial deals, which irked match-going fans, generated sufficient funds for United to sign players without requiring financial backing from the club's owners, though cynics would argue that such an approach only further benefited the Glazers. Woodward regrets his infamous statement that ""playing performance doesn't really have a meaningful impact on what we can do on the commercial side of the business”. However, given the board has to ""fight for every penny"", he will depart proud of the club's increase in revenue. The admirable way the club acted during the pandemic, freezing ticket prices and increasing fan engagement, are other things that he would point to as high points of his time at Old Trafford. However, no matter how good his commercial deals have been, or how many improvements have been made in terms of the recruitment process, there is only one way to view his tenure.  After eight and a half years, five managerial appointments and no major trophies, the Woodward era has been a failure, as he would reluctantly admit himself. ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/1-billion-transfers-zero-titles-woodward-man-utd-era-failure/blt670da35e598f9554,Charlotte Duncker,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1958,McKenna leaves Man Utd to become new manager at Ipswich,"Kieran McKenna has left his role as first-team coach at Manchester United to become the new manager at Ipswich Town. McKenna kept his job at Old Trafford after the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer last month but GOAL confirmed on Thursday that the 35-year-old coach was looking to leave and had held talks with an ambitious League One side.  United granted McKenna permission to spread his wings, with everyone at the club accepting it is a great opportunity for the Northern Irishman, and it has now been confirmed that he will succeed John McGreal at Portman Road. McKenna has told Ipswich's official website after signing a three-and-a-half-year contract: “I’d like to thank Mark Ashton and the owners for putting their faith in me and Martyn to take the club forward. ""Leaving a club like Manchester United was obviously a difficult decision, but I strongly believe in the opportunity to build something here. ""It feels like the right time, project and Club to make my first step into first-team management. ""For now, the focus for the team has to be on a huge game on Saturday. After that, I cannot wait to meet everyone and get to work."" He added in a farewell statement on United's official website:  ""It has been a great honour to work for Manchester United for the last five years.

9398,Man United don't get 3 points without him — Andre Onana's brilliance caught on camera,"Andre Onana has plenty to be proud of after a commanding display in the 2-1 win over Aston Villa this Sunday. The Manchester United goalkeeper pulled off eight saves throughout the game to thwart danger from the hosts. The most crucial ones are shown below, have a look - each at key moments in the game. He made a great block to deny a Villa chance right after Man United opened the scoring. He immediately saved another one just one minute later. After the break, Onana once again sprung into action to deny Villa, who were also not clinical enough with their finishing. Onana should have kept a clean sheet in this one for his consistency at making saves - something he's been criticised for.

11372,Argentina 1-2 Saudi Arabia: One of the Biggest Shocks in World Cup History,"On paper, it was the biggest mismatch of the 2022 World Cup. On the pitch… it was one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history. Saudi Arabia, ranked 51st in the world, stunned Argentina – one of the pre-tournament favourites – by coming from a goal down to record the most remarkable result in their country’s footballing history. If the romanticists have it their way, Lionel Messi will captain Argentina to glory in his last World Cup – and he still may; this defeat won’t prove terminal – but that particular narrative was trashed at the Lusail Stadium. It took Messi 10 minutes to score his seventh World Cup goal – all of which have come in the group stage of the competition – as he nonchalantly dispatched a penalty, the fourth awarded in the first five games of this tournament (all four have been converted). In doing so, the great man became the first Argentina player to find the net at four editions of the World Cup (2006, 2014, 2018, 2022) and – aged 35 years, 151 days – the Albiceleste’s second-oldest World Cup scorer after Martin Palermo against Greece in 2010 (36 years, 227 days). Saudi Arabia continued to employ a seemingly reckless high line. Emphasis on ‘seemingly’ – because Argentina were caught offside six times inside the first 32 minutes (more than any team in an entire match at the previous World Cup). The assistant referees (and the new semi-automated offside technology) were having a field day as the offside tally (all for Argentina) reached seven before half-time. 45 mins in: ""what are you thinking with that high line?!""FT: ""Hervé Renard, football genius!""#ARGKSA | #FIFAWorldCup pic.twitter.com/EBvCZZNu4O For all their success in thwarting the regular Argentine advances though, Saudi Arabia failed to muster a single shot in the first half – for the third time at a World Cup (previously vs. Germany in 2002 and vs. France in 1998). For Argentina, it was only the second time at a World Cup since 1966 that they’d not faced a single attempt in the opening 45 minutes (also vs. Greece in 2010, a game they won 2-0). Lionel Scaloni’s side, while no doubt disappointed not to be more than 1-0 up, will have felt sufficiently in control going into the break. Four minutes into the second half, they’d have felt anything but, as Saudi Arabia equalised with their first shot of the match – courtesy of Saleh Al Shehri. It was the striker’s fifth goal from his last five competitive shots on target – and the Green Falcons’ first-ever World Cup goal against a nation who’d previously lifted the trophy. And it took less than four minutes for things to go from bad to embarrassing for Argentina: skipper Salem Al Dawsari turned the game on its head with arguably the goal of the tournament so far – brilliantly bending it past Emi Martínez from the corner of the box. And with two goals in the bag, the mission for Saudi Arabia – defensively well-drilled by the familiarly white-shirted Hervé Renard, who picked up his first World Cup victory – was simple: hold on. They hardly had to contend with Messi and co. throwing the kitchen sink at them, though. The taps and the draining board and other related paraphernalia, sure, but Argentina hardly seriously tested Saudi goalkeeper Mohammed Al Owais after going behind; Messi’s skied free-kick rather summed up his alarmingly anonymous 90 (ok, 103) minutes. This historic upset ended a 36-match unbeaten run for Argentina, who still have to face Mexico and Poland, both ostensibly stronger opponents than the Saudis, as they look to avoid only their second World Cup group stage exit in their last 14 qualifications (they previously fell at the first hurdle in 2002). Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia made mathematical history by winning despite an expected goals output of just 0.14 – the lowest xG needed to win a World Cup clash since 1966 (after Japan’s 0.20 vs. Cameroon in 2010).",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2022/11/argentina-saudi-arabia-world-cup-2022-stats/,Tom Hancock,22/11/2022 6:35,the-analyst
5106,PSG star Neymar: Verratti a genius like Barcelona icons Xavi & Iniesta,"Neymar heaped praise on team-mate Marco Verratti after Paris Saint-Germain's 1-0 win over Real Madrid in the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday, comparing Verratti to Barcelona icons Xavi and Iniesta. Verratti started the game and played all 90 minutes while Neymar returned from injury as a substitute. PSG found the winner in stoppage time as Kylian Mbappe slid a shot through the legs of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. ""I knew Verratti was an excellent player, but I didn't realise he was so spectacular,"" Neymar said after the match.  ""He's a genius. He's one of the best midfielders I've played with, along with Xavi Hernandez and Iniesta."" The Italian completed 92 per cent of his passes, controlled 8 per cent of possession out of the entire match and made three successful tackles. He's long been regarded as an elite player, but his Euro 2020 and Champions League displays have helped elevate his reputation even futher. With so much attacking firepower in the side, it's vital for PSG to have a midfielder like Verratti who can link play together while also being able to defend counterattacks. Injuries have been a problem for him, but when he's healthy, he can be one of the best central players in the world.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/psg-neymar-verratti-genius-barcelona-icons-xavi-iniesta/blt3e3e52f386cd6bcd,Dan Bernstein,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5342,Adaptable Rooney a better tactical fit for Everton than hopelessly vague Lampard,"Looking at the chronology of previous Everton managers, there is perhaps no Premier League owner less interested in the tactical side of the game than Farhad Moshiri.  Lurching erratically from the firefighter Sam Allardyce to the attacking ambition of Marco Silva to the broad-strokes individualism of Carlo Ancelotti to the deep-lying pragmatism of Rafael Benitez, there is a distinct absence of joined-up thinking at Goodison Park. This tactical inconsistency, coupled with the control Moshiri gives his managers (the director of football, head of recruitment, and star left-back all departed Everton after losing a power battle with Benitez), explains Everton’s confused squad and the mess they are in both on and off the pitch.  And Moshiri, judging from the disparate names on the shortlist to replace Benitez, still hasn’t realised the importance of a coherent or streamlined approach. Duncan Ferguson and Frank Lampard could hardly be more different, Fabio Cannavaro is completely unproven, while Wayne Rooney has impressed at Derby County without an obvious tactical identity emerging. Rooney’s success at the interview stage won’t be determined by the tactical nous he can convey, nor a sense of DNA or identity, but nevertheless supporters will be keen to know exactly what the former forward could bring to Goodison Park. It’s a little unclear, such is the enormous gap between stoically putting out fires at a Championship club in administration and attempting to transform a mid-table Premier League side into European contenders. The only real similarity is that both Derby and Everton are cash-strapped, and both require a manager able to squeeze the most out of a crisis situation. On that score, there is no doubt Rooney is a good choice. One year of @WayneRooney in charge 🖤🤍The boss sat down with @OwenBradley this afternoon to look back on his first 12 months as our manager! 🐏#DCFC #dcfcfans His man-management skills have kept chins up at Pride Park against all the odds, as Derby somehow remain unlikely outsiders to survive relegation despite two points deductions. A club in administration, and with no sign of the nightmare ending, have no right to pick up 13 points from their last five Championship games. But keeping up morale in the trenches is not what Everton fans are after. They need a tactician as well as a leader, and although we only have a small sample size to work with, supporters can be encouraged by the adaptability and pragmatism Rooney has shown over the course of the 2021-22 campaign as he moves towards a more conservative brand of football. During his first half-season at Derby, after the honeymoon period was over and results turned sour, Rooney was criticised for chopping and changing too often, with his anxiety allegedly unsettling the players. However, this season, a more grounded Rooney has emerged. Whereas at first he seemed committed to high pressing and expansive football built slowly out from the back, this has gradually become less dogmatic with time. These days Derby are more about defensive solidity.  Derby tend to sit off their opponents in a mid-block, refusing to drop too deep but ensuring there are small distances between the players. Keeping the ball away from goal, but conceding possession, is their main way of playing – which is why Derby have the sixth-highest PPDA (11.24) and attempted the fifth-fewest tackles (13.6 per game). The high pressing has gone, and while the careful build-up play largely remains, Rooney has, again, given concessions to a less progressive approach. The basic system is still a 4-2-3-1, with Ravel Morrison dropping from the No.10 position to dictate the game and Tom Lawrence still the creative force dipping inside from the flank. However, Derby are happier playing longer balls now – and winning ugly. A case in point was the 1-0 win over West Brom at the end of December, when Rooney deployed a much deeper 3-4-3 formation to grind out the three points. This was a classic example of the former England captain switching systems to exploit opposition weaknesses and conceding the upper hand, a sign he has developed from a more idealistic coach to a reactive tactician – which is hardly a surprise given that Sir Alex Ferguson and David Moyes are his two biggest influences. How this would translate to managing Everton is difficult to predict, although it seems Rooney would be closer to Benitez or Moyes than Silva or Roberto Martinez. Fans might prefer something more attacking, more concerned with detailed and stylish football, but considering just how deep the crisis runs at Everton, employing a motivator is probably just as important as a tactical heavyweight. And besides, tactically speaking, there is no better option on the Everton shortlist.  Duncan Ferguson impressed by winning seven points from matches against Chelsea, Manchester United, and Arsenal as caretaker manager in December 2019, although he benefited significantly from facing Frank Lampard, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Freddie Ljungberg. It won’t be so easy this time and Ferguson’s old-fashioned approach – a deep line, a solid 4-4-2, long balls up to the target men, blood-and-thunder challenges – won’t ruffle feathers as it did in 2019. Of course, in the short term, Ferguson’s motivational qualities could give Everton a bounce (in his 3-1 win over Chelsea, Everton recorded the most tackles – 37 – of any Premier League club that decade) but the system would be found out long term. Cannavaro is such an unknown we cannot even guess at his tactical identity, while Lampard showed in two years at Chelsea that his philosophy is hopelessly vague, built on a free-for-fall adventurousness that made Chelsea very easy to counterattack. Where Rooney has shown adaptability and a willingness to learn pragmatism over the last year, Lampard showed no such humility at Stamford Bridge.  Rooney, then, is the best of the bunch, even if his reactive tactical setup at struggling Derby offers little insight into how he would navigate the Everton job. ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rooney-better-tactical-fit-everton-lampard/bltdd68722080c8a663,Alex Keble,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11270,Argentina vs. Australia Prediction and Preview: World Cup 2022,"After winning Group C, Argentina face Group D runners-up Australia in the round of 16 at Qatar 2022. Our match preview of this knockout stage match at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium features predictions from our supercomputer ahead of kick-off on Saturday. Midfielder Rodrigo De Paul believes Argentina are starting to “perform like the national team we are accustomed to” as they prepare for Saturday’s World Cup round of 16 showdown with Australia. Argentina arrived in Qatar as one of the tournament favourites only to be the victims of a stunning upset in their opening game, going down 2-1 to Saudi Arabia in the group stage. Wins over Mexico and Poland have got their campaign back on track, and with a favourable draw ahead of them, De Paul was in bullish mood. “You always learn from defeats and we found ourselves in a position that was unusual,” he said. “But we have shown a lot of character and personality. “We never changed what got us here. Sometimes it works well and sometimes it doesn’t but in the second half against Mexico we began to see the national team we are accustomed to, and we showed that for the full 90 minute against Poland.”  You must allow functional cookies to continue. The Atletico Madrid midfielder came in for criticism for his performance against the Saudis but says his love for the shirt is undimmed. “I am proud to wear the shirt of Argentina and I love the country where I was born,” he added. “I will defend the shirt until I die and I will always give my all. Sometimes things go better or worse, but I will never hide. This is what brought me here.” After finishing their game against Poland approaching midnight local time on Wednesday, Argentina will be back in action on Saturday evening against the Socceroos, a turnaround coach Lionel Scaloni described as “not right”. And he may have to do without winger Angel Di Maria, who was substituted after 59 minutes against the Poles. “He felt something in his quadriceps and we preferred to take him off,” said Scaloni. “Everyone knows how important he is, it’s not worth leaving a player on the pitch who could make an injury worse.” Lionel Messi will be looking to overcome a personal hoodoo in this match, with the PSG star looking to score in the knockout stages of the World Cup for Argentina for the first time, with all eight of his goals coming in the group stage. He’s had 23 efforts without scoring in the knockout stages, although he has assisted in the round of 16 in each of the 2010, 2014 and 2018 editions, making him the only player to assist in the knockout stages of the three previous tournaments. Argentina will go into the game as overwhelming favourites against an Australia side that defied expectations to emerge from a 2022 World Cup group that also contained France, Denmark and Tunisia. There’s undoubtedly a difference in quality – on paper – across both line-ups. None of Australia’s starting XI in their last game against Denmark play their domestic club football in the top five European leagues, with four of the 11 playing in second tiers, including striker Mitchell Duke at Fagiano Okayama in Japan. Compare this to Argentina, whose 11 players all play for top five European league or UEFA Champions League clubs, including seven-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi, Juventus winger Di Maria and young Manchester City star Julian Alvarez. Socceroos defender Bailey Wright cut an emotional figure following their 1-0 win over the Danes with his mother-in-law seriously ill at home. “It means a lot, I want to dedicate this to my wife, for her mum. To be honest, I’m not sure if she’s still with us,” he said through tears. “It’s been a really tough time back home but ultimately they made it possible for me to be here and to live one of my dreams. So I dedicate that to her. I hope she’s still with us. “It’s something I’ve kept to myself. We’ve all had a lot going on. [I’ve got a] job to do, got to be a professional all the time.” Sunderland defender Wright came on in the 74th minute to make his World Cup debut and was tasked with helping preserve a narrow lead provided by Mathew Leckie’s left-footed strike on the hour mark. “I knew Arnie [coach Graham Arnold] had in the back of his mind that he was potentially going to change things. It’s pretty special, it’s my second World Cup and to get on is special,” he added. “Achieving what we’ve achieved with that performance and the rewards you’re seeing now are for the efforts of the last four years. “When we set out on this journey, Arnie said our togetherness would help us make history. The sacrifices staff and players have had to make, a lot of people wouldn’t have seen those – people isolating, being away from family for weeks, months. “There’s a lot of people who aren’t here who have put that work in, but you’ve always felt the sense of togetherness, that your mate has got your back, it’s 11 brothers out there, whoever comes on. It’s pretty special to be part of that. It’s hard to put into words, it’s a real feeling.” Brighton playmaker Mac Allister was named man of the match in the win over Poland, primarily for his opening goal which settled Argentinian nerves. Having not started the opening game against Saudi Arabia, the Premier League star has played the last two and has profited from the space created by teams focusing their efforts on stopping Messi. Leckie scored his 14th goal for the Aussies in all competitions (first at the World Cup) against Denmark. His importance is demonstrated by the fact that’s at least five more than any other player in the squad. The 31-year-old has been directly involved in two of Australia’s three goals at the 2022 World Cup (one goal, one assist). He’s one of only three players to score and assist in a single World Cup for Australia, along with Tim Cahill (two goals, one assist) and John Aloisi in 2006 (one goal, two assists). Argentina’s gradual improvement since their shocking second-half display against Saudi Arabia means they are finally performing like one of the pre-tournament favourites. Australia are hard-working, honest and determined but it’s virtually impossible to think the Socceroos’ journey won’t end on Saturday.This is the first head-to-head meeting between Argentina and Australia since a September 2007 friendly, won 1-0 by the South American nation thanks to a goal from Martin Demichelis. This, however, will be the first time that they’ve ever met at the men’s FIFA World Cup. Our match prediction model gives Graham Arnold’s men just a 5% chance of causing an upset with Argentina rated an 81.8% chance of making it to the quarter-finals. The chance of the game going to extra time, with a draw at 90 minutes is rated at just 13.2%.

4603,Klopp tells Mane what he needs for Ballon d’Or bid as Liverpool boss salutes ‘world-class’ forward,"Sadio Mane is capable of forcing his way into contention for the 2022 Ballon d’Or if Liverpool go on to savour Champions League glory this season, says Jurgen Klopp, with a “world class” talent told European glory may be required in order to land a Golden Ball as he is not Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. While a Senegal international may not boast the individual records and awards of Argentine and Portuguese superstars, he remains a talismanic presence at Anfield and has hit 20 goals across all competitions in the current campaign. The most recent of those came in the first leg of a continental semi-final clash with Villarreal, with many now suggesting that Mane could compete with the likes of Karim Benzema and Kylian Mbappe for a prestigious prize that is handed out by France Football on an annual basis. Liverpool remain in contention for an unprecedented quadruple this season, with the Carabao Cup winners still in the running for another Premier League title while also reaching the last four of the Champions League and the FA Cup final. Mane continues to star across multiple competitions, with Klopp saying when asked if a man that has also savoured Africa Cup of Nations glory could challenge for the Ballon d’Or: “If you are not Messi or Ronaldo you have to win probably the Champions League, which we didn't do yet so give us a few more weeks and then we will see where we end up.” Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk have been the most serious contenders for Golden Ball honours at Anfield in the recent past, but Mane has remained a model of consistency for the Reds. He has reached the 20-goal mark for the fourth time in the last five seasons, with his versatility being put to good use as the likes of Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota also compete for starting berths in a star-studded attacking unit. Klopp added on Mane, who has been figuring as a striker of late, after seeing him wrap up a 2-0 victory over Villarreal that has given Liverpool one foot in the Champions League final: “He can play left, he can play central, both positions world-class. “He started for us here at Liverpool on the right wing. Some people in the room will remember his goal at Arsenal when it was his first goal, when he cut inside and fired the ball with his left foot into the far corner. Absolutely outstanding, love it. “There are different ways that Sadio plays and sometimes we want him to drop slightly more, but today we wanted him to stay even more between the centre-halves, keep them away and offer the runs in behind. He has the skill set for it.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/klopp-mane-ballon-d-or-liverpool-world-class-forward/bltf5f118fbee8bb0c3,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

A superb goal from William Saliba after 54 minutes added to a first-half brace from Martin Odegaard to make it three wins from three for Mikel Arteta's side. It's the first time since 2004 that Arsenal have started a Premier League season with three successive victories. Arteta's side were far too good for Bournemouth, with two goals from Odegaard inside the opening 11 minutes settling the contest before it had really even begun. There was no way back for the home side who were totally outclassed, with Saliba's sensational curling strike early in the second half capping a wonderful performance from the Gunners, who also had a goal from the excellent Gabriel Jesus ruled out for offside by VAR.",https://www.goal.com/en/lists/arsenal-winners-losers-ratings-sensational-saliba-sends/blt697ab8c8b8aff5c9,Charles Watts,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3899,"Grealish's decision-making 'excellent' against Man Utd, says Man City boss Guardiola","Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has said Jack Grealish's decision-making in the 4-1 win over Manchester United on Sunday was ""excellent"" as the forward continues to take the ""next step"" in his development. While Grealish did not have any goal involvements in the victory, he was a regular threat dribbling down the left wing, and his coach has noticed his ability to accurately determine when to go himself and when to lay off for a team-mate. Manchester City extended their Premier League lead over Liverpool back to six points with the result over their cross-town rival Red Devils. ""He was excellent,"" Guardiola said of Grealish to BBC Sport. ""[At one] moment he will understand in the final third, 'this ball is from me'. He is very generous. ""When you see Phil [Foden] and Riyad [Mahrez] in that moment, it is their ball. This is the next step for Jack, but in terms of decision-making, and using players in space, he was exceptional."" The former Aston Villa star has delivered four goals and three assists in all competitions this campaign. Despite less end product than may have been expected from him, Guardiola has continued to turn his direction amid a heated title race, and he has shown signs of improvement in recent months. Last week, for example, he scored in the FA Cup after latching on to a superb pass from Phil Foden.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/grealish-excellent-against-man-utd-man-guardiola/blt2b0c061fd28ae0c0,Dan Bernstein,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
965,Argentina coach Scaloni on Messi retirement talk: At some point it will happen but we must enjoy him,"Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni says fans should enjoy Lionel Messi while they still can because he will eventually retire. The 34-year-old suggested following Friday's qualifying win over Venezuela that he could call time on his international career after the 2022 World Cup. Messi said he has to ""rethink a lot of things"" after the tournament in Qatar and could opt to quit the national team. Asked at a press conference about the player's comments on Sunday, Scaloni admitted that the day will eventually come when Messi decides to retire.  “After playing in a World Cup, everyone makes assessments. I’m not in the heads of the players to know what they’re thinking,"" he said. ""In any case, you have to enjoy it. You don’t have to think about the future, enjoy their spectacular present. ""It’s the rule of life and at some point it will happen. It’s useless to think about what will happen after the World Cup."" Fellow Argentina star Angel Di Maria made it clear that he does not expect his career with the national team to continue beyond the World Cup. The Paris Saint-Germain player wrote in a post on Instagram that he has likely played his final home game for Argentina after they beat Venezuela in World Cup qualifying. Di Maria played a crucial role in the 3-0 victory, scoring one goal and assisting another, and Scaloni says it was the perfect way to say goodbye to the home fans. “I didn’t see the post but I understood it as being about this team, I would imagine,"" he said.  ""I spoke with him some time ago. That it’s the decision of the coach [for him to stop playing] and not them that leave us. There is an age for everyone, many trips have passed and matches, which I would imagine is difficult. ""I hope he said that about this year. I don’t know what is going on in his head. If it was the last, it could not have been any better. It came out like he would have dreamed it.  ""He put in the effort to be there and it’s very difficult that someone else would have played it or been available.  ""He didn’t just play, he had a goal, an assist and he got the ovation from the entire stadium.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/argentina-coach-scaloni-messi-retirement-talk-enjoy/blt622fb135168ec353,By Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5304,Karius reflects on Liverpool nightmare & congratulates Bayern for Mane transfer,"Loris Karius has been reflecting on the “ups and downs” of a stint at Liverpool that saw him take in 49 appearances for the Reds, with one of those being a nightmare outing in the 2018 Champions League final. The German goalkeeper has hit free agency this summer, after reaching the end of his contract at Anfield, and is currently on the lookout for a new club. He is not rushing that process, with all options being considered by the 28-year-old, but he is eager to get going again after tumbling out of favour on Merseyside on the back of an error-strewn performance against Real Madrid in 2018. Unfortunately for Karius, who was loaned out to Besiktas and Union Berlin after slipping down the pecking order at Liverpool, he will always be remembered on Merseyside for his mistakes that allowed a continental crown to slip through the Reds’ grasp. He admits to leaving the Premier League heavyweights with mixed emotions, telling Sky Deutschland of his experience in England and plans for the future: “There were ups and downs. It’s part of the game, that’s football, but I’ve developed as a person. “The level at which we worked every day and the professionalism that everyone exemplifies was unique. “I’ve never experienced it before and that’s why we’ve celebrated a lot of successes there. I’ll take my determination and this determination with me to my next job. “I’m free and I can make my own decisions. This is a new situation that I’m looking forward to. A new challenge is coming up, but that’s always a good thing. I’m ready, mentally and physically.” While Karius has already severed ties with the Reds, he could be followed out of the exits this summer by Senegalese forward Sadio Mane. A talismanic presence for Liverpool is being heavily linked with a move to Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich, and a former team-mate believes that transfer could prove beneficial to all concerned. Karius added on Mane's situation: “It would be a crazy transfer for Bayern because he’s one of the top players at Liverpool. “If Bayern Munich manages to sign someone like him, then you can only congratulate them and the Bundesliga too. It would be another star in the league, so I would be very happy for the Bundesliga. “Sadio Mane is very reserved, very down to earth. He also speaks a bit of German from his time in Salzburg. “I’ve always got along very well with him. Should he come to Germany, he won’t have any problems adapting.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/karius-liverpool-nightmare-mane-bayern-transfer/blt9210af93f2c36623,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6678,'Mine is worth more than yours!' - MLS legend Valeri details how Ibrahimovic told him and teammate to share his shirt,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic once swapped shirts with Diego Valeri and Sebastian Blanco following a Major League Soccer clash - but only gave the pair one to share as his was ""worth more"" than their tops combined. The idiosyncratic Swede, who has played his part in Milan's latest pursuit of Serie A glory this term, previously crossed swords with the Argentine duo when he played for LA Galaxy and they represented Portland Timbers. Now, Valeri has opened up on facing the forward, widely considered one of the modern greats of world football - and has revealed a funny anecdote about a post-match swap that raised an eyebrow or two. ""With Seba Blanco, we gave him our two shirts after a match [that the Timbers had won],"" the 35-year-old told TNT Sports. ""But he gave us only one in return and said that we should cut it in half because ""mine is worth more than yours""! ""He was a little angry about the game, but then he sent us another one afterwards. Facing Zlatan was spectacular. The first time we played, he killed us, he created all the chances and scored two goals. ""In the second, at home, we played a great game and scored four. He was very angry! He is imposing in the way he walks, plays, stands on the field. He made a big difference in MLS. He does some things, because of his physical form, that amazes his ability. It was very nice to face him."" Ibrahimovic is well-known for his larger-than-life actions, so that he made such a gesture is perhaps less surprising. Nevertheless, the Swede left his mark on MLS despite a brief stay and is continuing to deliver back in Europe too. The 40-year-old will have his eye on another Serie A title this term, over a decade on from his triumph at San Siro with Milan. Yet his struggles with injury this term have underlined his advancing years, suggesting that his time may finally be coming to a close at the top of the game.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mine-is-worth-more-than-yours-mls-legend-valeri-details-how/bltb9886b619e1c7683,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

38,Barcelona’s Aubameyang moves up to third in Europa League scoring charts,"Gabon captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang equalled Munas Dabbur's Uefa Europa League goal haul after netting the winner against Galatasaray in the Round of 16 second leg duel on Thursday. After going down in the 28th minute, Barcelona fought back and equalized nine minutes later, before Aubameyang scored the winning goal early in the second half. The strike, which was the forward's second in the competition since joining Barca, took Auba to third in the all-time scoring charts for Europe's secondary club competition. ""The Uefa Europa League is a favourite competition for Aubameyang and he now has 24 goals in 47 appearances and is joint third on the list of scorers from the group stages and beyond since it was renamed after being formally known as the Uefa Cup,"" Barcelona, who will face Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals, posted. ""The Gabon striker is level with Munas Dabbur and just two behind Aritz Aduriz on 26 and six behind all-time leader Radamel Falcao."" Following previous wins against Valencia, Napoli, and Elche, Thursday's victory was Barcelona’s fourth away win in a row as they recover from a poor start to the season. It was also the fourth time since the turn of the year when the Catalan side have fought back to win, since doing so against Linares in the Copa del Rey, and against both Atletico Madrid and Elche in La Liga. The victory in Turkey also means they are on an 11-game run without a defeat in all competitions, which is their best run in two years. Their most recent defeat was at the hands of Athletic Bilbao in the extra time of the Copa del Rey on January 20. Aubameyang’s manager Xavi Hernandez revealed he was satisfied with the team’s performance but warned that meant nothing ahead of their meeting against Real Madrid in the El Clasico this weekend. ""[Thusrday] was important. It is a European competition and we want to go far,"" the Spaniard said in Istanbul, as per Marca. ""You could say that we are in a good place [ahead of El Clasico], but that means nothing, I have seen that many times before. It will be very difficult. It will be tough.

10465,The Oldest and Youngest Premier League Teams in 2023-24,"We take a look at the average age of each Premier League team’s starting XIs this season to work out who fields the oldest and youngest teams… and also ask what the implications are of playing an old or a young team. It might only be a couple of weeks since we saw two of the Premier League’s elder statesmen in Ashley Young and James Milner run ragged by comparatively young upstarts Luis Díaz and Jérémy Doku but, having looked into the data since, we can conclude that, in footballing terms, age really is just a number. Ten rounds of fixtures into 2023-24, we have decided to run the numbers to work out which teams field the youngest and oldest players, and what the age of a team means for their chances of success. We looked at which teams show faith in young players at the end of last season, and found that while Arsenal, with the second-lowest average age of their starting XIs at 25 years and 51 days, ran Manchester City close in the title race, it was generally the case that the youngest teams fared worst. The three teams other than Arsenal with the youngest average starting XIs – Southampton (25 years, 41 days), Leeds United (25 years, 285 days) and Leicester City (26 years, 155 days) – were all relegated. That goes against what is often the perceived wisdom: that it is a positive to have younger players because it means they can develop and make for a brighter future. Some managers prefer to work with younger players because they are more likely to take on their ideas. But what about the here and now? The young players at Southampton, Leeds and Leicester might well be back in the Premier League before long, but will that be with their current clubs? In 2023-24, though, there is less correlation between league position and age, as you can see here. Here’s a breakdown of the teams to field the youngest and oldest starting XIs in the Premier League this season. Well, Arsenal have defied fate and have actually got younger. Mikel Arteta set out in the summer to recruit youth over experience. The average age of Arsenal’s starting XIs in Premier League games so far in 2023-24 is 24 years and 335 days. Second in the league again and hot on Tottenham’s tails at the top, they again also have the second-youngest team in the division this season. They are just ‘behind’ – in terms of age – a team faring rather less well this term, in Burnley. Vincent Kompany has been bold with the football his team has played since promotion to the top flight – too bold, some might say – and he has also placed a lot of trust in youth. With the likes of 19-year-old Luca Koleosho starting eight of their 10 games, and 21-year-olds James Trafford and Ameen Al Dakhil starting all 10 (goalkeeper Trafford has been ever present), the average age of Burnley’s starting XIs in their first season back in the big time is just 24 years and 170 days. That is younger than Southampton’s last term, and given how poorly Burnley have started 2023-24 – they have taken just four points from a possible 30 – it might seem like history could repeat itself for this season’s youngest Premier League team. Time will tell if the experience that the Burnley youngsters are getting in the Premier League will help them in the long run. Burnley and Arsenal are responsible for each of the 12 youngest starting XIs to be fielded in the Premier League this season.   Chelsea have the third-youngest team, with Mauricio Pochettino’s expensively assembled squad of young (mainly attacking midfield) players meaning they have an average age of their starting XIs of 24 years and 352 days. They are struggling somewhat so far this season, though that is surely more because of the speed with which the squad was thrown together and expected to perform, rather than anything particularly wrong with the fact they’re young. They would be ‘top’ of this list were it not for the presence of 39-year-old evergreen centre-back Thiago Silva, who is one of only 18 outfielders across the entire Premier League to have played every minute this season. He is six years older than the second oldest (Kyle Walker, 33) of those players, and 18 years older than the youngest (Bournemouth’s Illia Zabarnyi, 21). The fourth-youngest team are the Premier League’s leaders, Tottenham. Ange Postecoglou has revamped the squad since arriving in the summer, and factors such as the signings of young players like Micky van de Ven and Guglielmo Vicario, and increased game time for Pape Matar Sarr have brought the average age of the team right down. Spurs previously had the third-oldest average starting XI (27 years, 356 days) in the Premier League in 2022-23 – former manager Antonio Conte placed much more importance on experience than youth – but they are now at the more youthful end of the spectrum (25 years, 29 days). Fulham and West Ham have continued – almost exactly – where they left off last season. After ranking as the oldest and second-oldest teams, respectively, in the Premier League in 2022-23, with the only starting XIs that had an average age higher than 28 years old, they have now traded places. In 2023-24, Fulham have the oldest average starting XI – pushing 30, at 29 years and 193 days – and West Ham are only slightly younger, at 28 years and 322 days. Fulham have had as inconsistent a start to the season as it is possible to have. They are the only team in the Premier League that have neither won, drawn or lost consecutive games all season, while their longest unbeaten run is just two matches. Although currently 14th, they haven’t really been in the relegation conversation at all this season. That may be in part because they are only five points off Newcastle in sixth place, while they are seven points clear of the drop zone. However, with first-team regulars in Willian (35), Tim Ream (36) and Raúl Jiménez (32) all the wrong side of 30, they may need a summer refresh next year. West Ham have hit a poor run of form, losing four of their last six matches, but they are still ninth in the table after an impressive start to the season. Their oldest first-team regular is 33-year-old Michail Antonio, but he stands out in terms of age; the squad David Moyes has put together suggests he likes players to be between the ages of 26 and 31.  Only two players currently under the age of 26 have appeared for West Ham in the league this season – 23-year-old Mohamed Kudus and 25-year-old Konstantinos Mavropanos – and they have played a combined total of just 186 minutes (with Kudus accounting for 185 of those minutes). Newcastle are the best-performing of the teams at the older end of the league, currently sixth in the table with the third-highest average age of their starting XIs. They are the league’s top scorers (26 goals) and will have aspirations of achieving another top-four finish at the very least this season.  The numbers suggest there is little to glean from the average age of each team’s starting XIs in 2023-24.  But that said, it is still easy to come away thinking about how much better Arsenal, Chelsea and Spurs can become as their current squad gets used to playing together. Burnley, meanwhile, will need to get a lot better pretty quickly if they are to survive. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new football newsletter to receive exclusive weekly content.

Much of the focus was on Toni Kroos, who returned to his homeland amid speculation over whether he would return again in the summer to play for the national team. He was the protagonist on and off the pitch, but as usual, handled it all with typical composure and a streak of dry wit.  Before the match Kroos admitted he was considering coming out of retirement for Germany, while also saying he did not know whether he would extend his deal with Real Madrid deal. He also opined on the stick he got from fans in Saudi Arabia during the Spanish Supercup last month.

6852,'I lost my number one fan' - Heartbroken ex-Man Utd & City striker Tevez retires from football following death of his father,"Carlos Tevez has announced that he has retired from football, explaining that the passing of his ""number one fan"", his father Segundo Raimundo, was the main reason he has decided to stop playing. The 38-year-old, who revealed that he had offers to continue his career, featured for some of Europe's biggest clubs, including both Manchester clubs and Juventus, while he also had three spells with Boca Juniors. Tevez hasn't played a competitive match since leaving Boca in 2021, with his father having passed away in February of that year, and he has now confirmed on national television in Argentina that he has officially hung up his boots. Tevez told Argentine talk show Animales Sueltos: ""I've retired, it's confirmed. I had offers from many places, but as a player I had already given everything I had. ""My last year playing [at Boca Juniors] was very hard because he (Tevez's late father, Segundo Raimundo) was brain dead. I woke up one day and told Vane (Tevez's wife, Vanessa): 'I don't want to play anymore'. ""I called Adrian (Tevez's agent, Adrian Ruocco) in the afternoon and told him: 'Look, I'm not going to play anymore. I'm retiring'. ""They asked me all the time why I had stopped playing until I told them: 'I stopped playing because I lost my number 1 fan'. I was eight years old and he was the one who came to watch me. ""Why else have I decided to retire]? I told them: 'I don't play for anyone anymore'. I think that (his decision to retire) was the only time I really thought about myself. I had lost my number one fan and that made me not want to play anymore."" Tevez, who mutually agreed to end his contract with Boca six months early back in June 2021, is looking to remain in football, despite retiring from playing. The ex-Manchester United and City striker is now planning to become a technical director and will work closely with Carlos Chapa Retegui, who is a former player and coach of Argentina national hockey team. ""I am very excited about what we have with my brothers and with Chapa Retegui,"" he said.  ""We have been working together for four or five months now and the truth is that we are putting together a comprehensive project."" It is unclear at this stage if Tevez will be involved with Boca or another club in Argentine football.

""We wanted to win the first leg but if we couldn't win I would have settled for a draw and that's exactly what happened. Our organisation was very good, we combined well in all the lines. ""But we didn't react quickly, so that's something we have to work on because we cannot allow the Ghanaian players freedom on the ball.""

10517,Leicester City’s Lightning Start Gives Hope for Rapid Return to the Premier League,"Leicester City are back in the second tier of English league football for the first time in 10 seasons, but their excellent start to 2023-24 suggests they won’t be hanging about for long. Leicester City may have suffered relegation after nine successive seasons of Premier League football, but Foxes fans will be the first to admit the eight preceding the drop in 2022-23 might have been the greatest period in the club’s history. The fairytale Premier League title win in 2015-16 – their first top-flight league title since being founded in 1884 – was followed by a first FA Cup trophy in 2020-21. That came on top of reaching the UEFA Champions League quarter finals in 2016-17 and a UEFA Europa Conference League semi-final appearance in 2021-22. Then 2022-23 happened. Financial backing that had previously been provided to bulk up the squad saw the handbrake pulled, while this was coupled with poor recruitment choices using the money that they were given to spend on players. It wasn’t something that happened overnight, of course – worries about financial fair play, as well as struggles following the Covid pandemic added to the issues of a club still scarred by the awful, unexpected death of owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha in a helicopter crash outside the King Power Stadium in October 2018. Brendan Rodgers’ very decent four-year reign as head coach was ended in April 2023, and the club raised eyebrows in replacing him with Dean Smith. Smith – who led Norwich City to relegation in bottom place the season before – was unable to keep the club in the Premier League with just nine points from eight games in charge. Enzo Maresca was plucked from his role as assistant to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City and tasked with getting Leicester City back to the Premier League. An exciting appointment, but not one without concerns from the fanbase. Maresca’s only previous managerial job was an ill-fated 14-game spell in charge of Parma in Serie B. In what was a similar task to that at Leicester, Maresca was given the job of getting a big side back into the top-flight with a squad packed with big names for that level. He failed to make a good start there and paid the price, lasting four months into the 2021-22 season before being sacked. The good news for Maresca and Leicester is that life in the Championship couldn’t have gone much better. Leicester’s start to life back in the Championship has been exceptional – only blemished by one blot on the copy book; a 1-0 home defeat to Hull City on 2 September despite controlling large periods of the match. Only five teams in the history of the English second tier have collected more points after 11 games than this Leicester side (based on three points for a win) and just two of those were since the inception of the Premier League in 1992-93. All 10 previous sides to have won 30+ points from their opening 11 games of a second-tier season in England have gone on to win promotion to the top flight, while Leicester’s current average of 2.73 points per game puts them on course to smash the current second-tier points record of 106 set by Reading in 2005-06. Their plus-17 goal difference is also among the best seen at Championship level after 11 games. Since the inception of the Premier League in 1992, only five clubs have managed a goal difference of at least +17 after 11 games – all five of those went on to win the title: Newcastle in 1992-93 (+18), Sunderland in 1998-99 (+18), Fulham in 2000-01 (+25), Portsmouth in 2002-03 (+17) and QPR in 2010-11 (+21). The last three seasons of Championship football have been slightly misleading when it comes to thinking how easy it can be to win promotion back to the Premier League the season after relegation. The last three title winners (Norwich in 2020-21, Fulham in 2021-22 and Burnley in 2022-23) all remained in the Championship for one season before winning promotion back as champions. Just 12 of the last 30 Championship seasons have seen a team relegated from the Premier League go on and win the title in the following second-tier campaign – something it looks like Leicester might do this season. For every successful bounce-back to the Premier League, there are two unsuccessful ones, on average. However, many other clubs have proven that even with the comfort of parachute payments, promotion from the second tier back to the top flight is a very tough ask. Since 2016-17, just six of the 21 promoted sides from the Championship had come from the Premier League the season before. Overall, since 1993-94 in the second tier, just 27 of the 89 relegated Premier League clubs have won promotion to the Premier League at the first time of asking (30%) and of those, seven have come via the play-offs. At this stage, it’s hard to tell if this is a case of Leicester being great or their big lead over the non-automatic promotion-placed Championship teams coming from others’ failure to find consistency. After all, since the competition was rebranded as the Championship in 2004-05, we’ve never seen such a large gap between the top side and third place after 11 matches as this season (10 points). Well, based on the top-level metrics for the Championship season so far, maybe Leicester are just that good. They have the best defensive record in the competition with only six goals conceded from a league-low 9.9 expected goals (xG), while only Ipswich Town (25) have outscored Leicester both overall (23) and from non-penalty situations (20) in 2023-24. Addititonally, they are only behind fellow relegated side Southampton in terms of possession (63.8%), successful passes overall (563) and completed passes in the opposition half (258). A deeper look at their possession numbers shows more dominance. Their average open-play sequence time is a league-high 13.9 seconds, while they average a league high 4.9 passes in those open-play sequences. They’ve tallied the most open-play passing sequences of at least 10 passes (222), with 55 of those ending in either a touch in the opposition box or a shot. In basic terms, they are the most intricate side in possession of the ball in the Championship this season – similar to Burnley in their title-winning campaign under Vincent Kompany last term, but a shade above their 4.2 passes and 12.1 seconds per open-play sequence. Leicester have attempted four shots in the Championship this season with a passing sequence of at least 25 passes in the build-up to the attempt – that’s the same tally as all the other 23 Championship sides in 2023-24 combined. One of those – Wilfred Ndidi’s 45th-minute strike at Southampton on 15 September – found the back of the net following a move of 33 passes. No other Championship goal this season has been scored from a sequence of more than 16 passes. This isn’t to say that they don’t counter-attack, though. With 11 shots from fast breaks in the Championship this season, they are one of the leading sides at shots in transition behind only Plymouth (16), Blackburn (15) and Leeds (12). Even without the ball, Maresca’s side work hard to win it back before the opposition get out of their own half. Their PPDA (opposition passes per defensive action) is the fourth lowest in the competition at 11.3, while no side have scored more goals following high turnovers than they have (four) already in 2023-24. One minor criticism of Leicester has been that they don’t have their possession in the most dangerous of areas on the pitch. Only Hull (23%) have seen a lower proportion of their successful passes end in the final third of the pitch than Leicester (25%) this season, but a lot of that can be explained by Leicester not needing to get the ball into attacking areas as much, having led in games as often as they have. Field tilt is a measure of territorial dominance between teams. It looks at the share of possession each team has in their attacking third compared to their opponent, and Leicester’s is only the fifth highest in the Championship at 59.6% and well below that of Burnley last season (66.9%). That being said, Burnley often had to apply pressure in the attacking half due to game state – goals scored in the final 30 minutes of Championship matches last season won Burnley 20 points more (31) than their opponents (11). Unsurprisingly for a team who see a lot of their passes made in the defensive half, Leicester’s defenders see lots of the ball. Of players to play at least 300 minutes of Championship action for Leicester this season, four of their five most frequent passers on a per-90-minute basis are their most used back four in recent games (Jannik Vestergaard, Wout Faes, James Justin and Ricardo Pereira), with the other being the deep-lying central midfielder Harry Winks. In fact, of all Championship players to play at least 300 minutes this season, Vestergaard’s 94 successful passes per 90 is the highest in the league, while Winks’ 84 average is the highest by any midfield player. Even when Vestergaard is missing, it’s integral for the central defenders to be comfortable on the ball. Conor Coady came into the side for the recent 3-0 home win over Preston North End and completed more passes than anyone else on the pitch (120). While Justin has spent time out injured and Leicester have been forced to use other players in that left-back role (Hamza Choudhury played there in their last game, a 2-0 win over Stoke on 7 October), Maresca has used Pereira at right-back for the majority of the league season (875 mins of 990). His role in the system is as an inverted full-back in possession, often coming inside to support Winks in building up play through the middle of the pitch and allowing one of the most talented players in the Championship – Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall – more freedom to attack. With Pereira’s constant movement inside when Leicester are in possession, this has contributed towards the most lopsided attack in the Championship. No team has seen a smaller proportion of their touches in the attacking half on the right side of the pitch than Leicester (28.6%), while their proportion through the middle is the biggest (32.0%). Much of that is down to the talent they have in the middle. Both Winks and Dewsbury-Hall are arguably playing a level below where they should be, so it comes as no shock to have seen Maresca use them the most frequently of all Leicester players in the Championship this season. Winks has missed just seven minutes of league action, while Dewsbury-Hall has played 924 of a possible 990 minutes on the pitch. Dewsbury-Hall leads the Championship for the most open-play shot involvements (86) while only Plymouth’s Finn Azaz (9.3) has been involved in more on a per-90 average (8.4) of players with 500+ minutes played. Azaz (26) is also the only player in the league to have created more chances for teammates from open play than the 25-year-old Leicester midfielder (25). Winks is constantly on the ball, with the former England international receiving 842 open-play passes from teammates this season – 123 more than any other Championship midfielder. His involvement in open-play shots is more understated, with his role being earlier in passing sequences. He’s been involved in 63 of Leicester’s open-play shots but a league-high 52 of those have seen his only involvement being in the build-up, rather than as the creator or player to attempt the shot. He’s also made the second-highest number of secondary chances created (the pass before a chance created) with 18, two behind Hayden Hackney of Middlesbrough (20). Both players are key to winning the ball back for Leicester, too. Dewsbury-Hall has won possession from opponents in the final third of the pitch on 16 occasions this season, which is four higher than any other Championship player, while Winks has started five of Leicester’s open-play passing sequences that have ended in a shot by winning possession back from an opponent – only Norwich’s Shane Duffy (six) and Ipswich’s Massimo Luongo (seven) have done so more often. Jamie Vardy may still be scoring goals, pestering defences and annoying opposition supporters at the age of 36, while he’s joined in the 30+ club by teammates Marc Albrighton and defenders Vestergaard, Coady and Pereira, but the core of Leicester’s side are in their peak ages or below. They’ve used the loan market wisely, bringing in Abdul Fatawu (19 years old), Callum Doyle (20) and Cesare Casadei (20), all under 21 years old, while four-goal Kasey McAteer (21) is another player who has played in over half of their Championship games this season. Leicester’s average starting XI age of 25 years and 364 days is only the 10th youngest in the Championship this season, but that average is dragged up by Vardy, who has played in all 11 games. The club are clearly at the start of a rebuild, with many players departing in the summer following relegation. Some, like the excellent James Maddison and Harvey Barnes, were always going to happen following the drop to the Championship. Others, such as Youri Tielemans, Daniel Amartey, Ayoze Pérez and Çağlar Söyüncü, were released and allowed the club to offload high earners and free up spots in the squad for those young loanees. Those that did stay, such as Vardy, Ndidi, Pereira and Kelechi Iheanacho have all contributed towards their great start, while homegrown talent Choudhury returned following a decent loan spell at Watford last season. The last time Leicester came up from the Championship, they won the Premier League title within two years. While that dream looks an even bigger stretch this time around, Leicester and Maresca are showing there are reasons for the fans to be excited about the rest of this season and beyond, on the pitch.

A meeting with old adversaries Manchester United was taken in at the Bangkok Century Cup, in a contest that was billed as ‘The Match’, but the Reds suffered a 4-0 defeat. From there, Klopp’s men headed to Singapore for a Standard Chartered Cup clash with Premier League rivals Crystal Palace, winning 2-0 thanks to goals from Jordan Henderson and Mohamed Salah, before then taking in a meeting with RB Leipzig in Germany, which they won 5-0, courtesy of another Salah strike and four goals from new signing Darwin Nunez. Red Bull Salzburg got a 1-0 victory over the Reds on July 27 before a curtain-raising Community Shield clash with Manchester City on July 30. Jurgen Klopp's team secured the first piece of silverware in that clash at the King Power Stadium in Leicester.  Trent Alexander-Arnold opened the scoring in the first half before Julian Alvarez levelled for City after 70 minutes. Mohamed Salah restored the Reds' lead with a penalty before Darwin Nunez put the result beyond doubt in stoppage time. The Reds will return to home soil a day later to face French side Strasbourg at Anfield, who cruised to a 3-0 win against a weakened Liverpool squad. Player Goals Darwin Nunez 5 Mohamed Salah 3 Jordan Henderson 1 Trent Alexander-Arnold 1 Tickets for an intriguing clash with Manchester United were available through ThaiTicketMajor and ranged in price from 5,000 baht (£116) to 25,000 baht (£581).

Liverpool will raise the curtain on the English football season on July 30 when they contest the Community Shield against Manchester City at Wembley. Their season begins in earnest a week later when they face newly promoted Fulham in the Premier League on August 6. Klopp's side will be competing for honours across the league, Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup. See Liverpool's full Premier League fixture list. Liverpool have had an eventful summer till now with a few prominent arrivals and departures. Sadio Mane left for a new challenge with Bayern Munich, Takumi Minamino was sold to Ligue 1 side AS Monaco, while 2019 UEFA Champions League hero Divock Origi joined Serie A champions AC Milan.  However, they have reinforced their squad with quality additions like Nunez, Fabio Carvalho, and Calvin Ramsay. Liverpool paid Benfica £64 million ($79m) upfront to sign Nunez, and could pay up to another £21m ($26m) in add-ons.  He has signed a six-year contract that will keep him at Liverpool until 2028. Reports suggest that Nunez will earn around £5m ($6.1m) per year in salary, similar to Diaz and Jota rather than the top earners such as Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino.  Our new 2️⃣7️⃣ has a special message for you, Reds 😁 pic.twitter.com/3FIpBC21Zc Meanwhile, Carvalho has cost the Reds £8 million ($10m), and as Jurgen Klopp suggests boasts the ability to “bring a stadium to its feet”. Their talisman Salah has also renewed for three more years putting an end to all the uncertainties regarding his future.  You can see Liverpool's 37-man pre-season squad below.

4332,Manchester City defender Mendy released on bail as he faces multiple rape and sex offence charges,"Manchester City defender Benjamin Mendy has been released on bail as he awaits trial for multiple charges of rape and sexual assault. The 27-year-old Frenchman, who faces seven charges of rape and one of sexual assault, was granted bail by Judge Patrick Thompson at a hearing at Chester Crown Court on Friday. Mendy will stand trial for the rape and sexual assault charges later this year. His trial was initially scheduled for January 2022, but has been put back. Mendy was initially charged on August 26, 2021, on multiple sexual offence charges relating to five women. The charges brought against Mendy relate to incidents that are alleged to have taken place between October 2020 and August 2021. He was denied bail for a second time at the start of October 2021, but has now been granted bail at a hearing on Friday which was closed to the press. Mendy was suspended by Premier League champions Man City following the initial charges. He moved to England from Monaco in 2017 and has made 75 appearances for City, with one of those coming in the 2021-22 campaign.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/manchester-city-mendy-bail-rape-sex-offence-charges/bltc0b14a64e6549dfe,Emma Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8620,Rasmus Hojlund sets new Man United record even Cristiano Ronaldo failed to do,"Rasmus Hojlund is now the youngest Manchester United player to have scored in four consecutive Premier League games, as per Opta. On his 21st birthday, Hojlund scored his fourth goal in as many games in the 3-0 win over West Ham United at Old Trafford. Even Cristiano Ronaldo, who is one of the club's most legendary players, failed to achieve this before turning 21. Hojlund has already hit five goals in the Champions League for Man United this season. It's a shame they didn't make it further. He took time to begin scoring in the Premier League but now that the floodgates are open, it looks like Hojlund can't stop.

3717,What is the Neymar - Mbappe 'feud' about? PSG rift explained,"While there are obvious benefits to splashing the cash and pooling world-class talent into one star-studded squad, the presence of big personalities and egos – such as those possessed by Paris Saint-Germain forwards Kylian Mbappe and Neymar – is always likely to cause problems. The reigning Ligue 1 champions have been finding that out to their cost in 2022-23, with rifts emerging in the Parc des Princes ranks. Why have French and Brazilian internationals been butting heads and what has been done to try and resolve a supposed feud that could cause irreparable damage to collective harmony? GOAL takes a look... There had been talk of tension in the camp prior to matters reaching boiling point in a Ligue 1 clash between PSG and Montpellier on August 13, 2022. In the 21st minute of that contest, World Cup winner Mbappe fluffed his lines from the penalty spot seeing his effort saved by Jonas Omlin. PSG were then awarded another spot-kick a couple of minutes before the interval, with Neymar this time deciding to pick up the ball and take matters into his own hands. Mbappe was, despite his earlier miss, visibly annoyed at being removed from penalty duty and went as far as airing his grievances in Neymar’s ear before the Brazilian waved him away and duly found the back of the net. There was also an incident during the game where after being overlooked for a through-ball by Portuguese midfielder Vitinha, Mbappe stopped running and threw his arms up in the air. The drama continued after a final whistle had been blown, and there are reports of Sergio Ramos having to intervene as Mbappe and Neymar threatened to come to blows in the dressing room with heated questions being asked of supposed acts of petulance. Things did not stop there, with Neymar going on to like a tweet from a supporter that suggested Mbappe’s lucrative new contract – which he signed on the back of being heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid as a free agent - had left him feeling like the “owner of PSG”. There have been reports of power going to the Frenchman’s head, with there being talk at one stage of him pushing to get a South American colleague moved out of Paris during the summer transfer window. Mbappe and Neymar were all smiles in PSG’s next outing, against Lille, with the deadlock broken in that contest after just eight seconds. A talismanic front three, which also includes seven-time Ballon d’Or winner Lionel Messi, all combined to see Mbappe record what would be the first of his three efforts in an impressive hat-trick display. GOAL learned ahead of that fixture that discussions had been held behind closed doors regarding divides in the PSG ranks. A team meeting was held in an attempt to get to the bottom of the issue and have everybody singing from the same hymn sheet once more. Senior officials were involved in those talks, with Neymar and Mbappe told to bury the hatchet and learn how to co-exits for the good of the team. The entire PSG squad was present when those requests were made, with everybody under strict orders to obey the rules and put on positive displays in public – especially on matchdays when a global spotlight falls on them. Head coach Christophe Galtier believes the matter has been swept under the carpet, saying when quizzed on a potentially costly breakdown in professional working relationships: “There is no discomfort, it's fine. “Of course, we quickly met the next day to iron out all that and say what we had to say to each other. That's why there is no malaise and I confirm it with a lot of sincerity.” Mbappe’s new contract is set to keep him at Parc des Princes until 2025, while Neymar – the most expensive player on the planet - is working on terms through to the same summer.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-neymar-mbappe-feud-about-psg-rift-explained/blt89b62923913327a8,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5692,Ten Hag disappointment as Ajax lose Dutch Cup final to PSV after Onana and Haller dropped,"Manchester United-linked Erik ten Hag showed in Ajax’s Dutch Cup final clash with PSV that he is not afraid to make big calls as he dropped Sebastien Haller and Andre Onana, but was left disappointed and facing questions following a 2-1 defeat. The Eredivisie title hopefuls took the lead as in-demand Ryan Gravenberch opened the scoring, but they conceded twice in the second-half – with Cody Gakpo, another man sparking talk of interest from England, grabbing what proved to be the winner. Ten Hag, who replaced 33-goal top scorer Haller with Brian Brobbey and left first-choice goalkeeper Onana out of his squad entirely, cut a frustrated figure afterwards as he felt Ajax had done enough to get their hands on more major silverware. The 52-year-old, who refused to answer any questions on his links to United, told Voetbal International: “There should have been only one team with the cup, that is Ajax. “We do that to ourselves, we make two very big mistakes. While we had said to each other that you have to stay 100 per cent focused. “You have to defend much better, you can never let Gakpo come in, that’s where his qualities lie. There are two people standing by, you have to keep him on the left.” He added: “We score a great goal with [Davy] Klaassen; just offside. And a shot from [Dusan] Tadic on the post. It wasn’t supposed to be, those are the forces and powers in football. It wasn’t easy, but you also have to enforce it yourself.” While suggesting that Ajax did not get the rub of the green against PSV, Ten Hag also took aim at the match officials when expanding on the reasons why his side failed to get over the line in a major final. He said: “We played against more than eleven players. Nevertheless, we showed character and we should not have lost this game, but that has happened.” There have been plenty of reports claiming that Ten Hag has already agreed to become Manchester United’s new permanent manager in 2022-23, as the Red Devils seek a long-term successor to interim coach Ralf Rangnick, but no official announcement has been made yet.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ten-hag-ajax-dutch-cup-final-psv-onana-haller/blteac95739642b291b,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10895,"Pressing is Better Than Ever Before, So Does Your Team Need a Big Man Up Top?","When a Premier League manager chooses to do something differently, they might get the odd person taking note. When Pep Guardiola opts for a tactic we haven’t seen for a while or ever before, people will study what he has done because it could end up being the latest stage in the evolution of the game for which the Manchester City manager is responsible. So, looking back on the night he took Manchester City to the Emirates in February, with his side three points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal having played a game more than their title rivals, and how they beat the Arsenal press by going long, could it be that we were witnessing something seminal? Arsenal had been the best team in the Premier League up until that point, and they had the best press in the division, too. Led by Martin Ødegaard, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Jesus, Arsenal forced more high turnovers of possession than any other team in the top flight (388). Going into the game against City, they had also had the most shots following a high regain (36 in 21 games). Guardiola recognised how well Arsenal pressed and decided to approach the game differently. So, City went direct. This wasn’t Sam Allardyce’s Bolton, with Jussi Jääskeläinen launching balls up to Kevin Davies, but it also wasn’t entirely recognisable as Guardiola’s City. They attempted just 140 passes in their own half, and completed only 120. They had 36.5% possession. All three were the lowest figures City have recorded in a Premier League game in Guardiola’s entire seven-year reign – or 266 matches. In no other game in his City career has goalkeeper Ederson played more balls into the opposition’s half than he did that night at the Emirates (20). He often plays long balls with pinpoint accuracy to an attacking teammate in space whether he is under pressure or not, but on that night at Arsenal, the ploy was clear: beat the Arsenal press by going over the top. City hadn’t been on their best form in the weeks leading into the game – they had lost across north London at Tottenham 10 days earlier, having also lost the Manchester derby at Old Trafford and been knocked out of the League Cup at Southampton the previous month. So, there was likely some part of Guardiola’s plan that was simply being pragmatic given the opposition and the challenge his team faced. It isn’t as though City played that way for the rest of the season and hoofed their way to the treble. But the arrival of Erling Haaland has at least allowed Guardiola to consider changing the way his team play. Without a big centre-forward, City couldn’t have done this a year earlier. Even if they don’t go direct every week, they did do so more last season than they had previously under Guardiola. Ederson recorded six of his 11 highest totals for long passes in a Premier League game in the 2022-23 campaign. For the return game against Arsenal at the Etihad, it wasn’t quite so extreme, but there was still an obvious plan. At home, City are always more likely to dominate, but their 51.9% possession was the sixth lowest they had recorded on home soil in a Premier League game under Guardiola. As early as the sixth minute, Arsenal showed their intentions as Ødegaard initiated a high press, supported by three teammates. Under pressure deep in his own half, John Stones saw no problem with going long. He targeted Haaland, who had pinned Rob Holding – undoubtedly the weak link in Arsenal’s lineup that day – with his back to goal. He held off his opponent, and brought the ball under control with his first touch… …before laying it off to an onrushing Kevin De Bruyne. The Belgian then burst through the heart of the Arsenal team. Nine seconds after Stones had decided to boot the ball up the pitch, it was in the back of the Arsenal net. So, is this the latest way in which Guardiola will revolutionise football, or was it just a practical tactic used on a couple of occasions to beat the best-performing side in England? And what could other teams learn from what happened? Pressing is becoming a more important part of the game with every passing year. And teams from the top of the Premier League right down to the bottom are all getting better at it. For the seventh season in succession, Premier League teams set a record for the total number of high regains made, with 6,095, or 16 per game. High turnovers have been rising steadily ever since Opta started collecting this data in detail, with 2022-23’s total more than 2,000 higher than in 2012-13, a decade earlier. Teams aren’t just winning the ball high up the pitch more; they are doing more with it after winning it back. High regains leading to shots are also higher than ever before, having increased season on season over the past 13 years. And so are goals following a high regain. The 98 such goals that were scored in 2022-23 was 20 more than the season before, and more than double the total scored in 2010-11. Every team in the league scored at least one goal following a high turnover; City, Arsenal, Brentford and Tottenham led the Premier League with nine each, followed by relegated Leicester City (seven), Brighton and another relegated side in Leeds United (six each). All sorts of teams press high, and the likes of Brentford and Brighton do so incredibly well and incredibly intelligently. As a result, it’s getting more and more difficult to play out short from the back, which is presumably at least part of the reason that Ederson went long more often in 2022-23. Old-school centre-forwards are very much a thing of the past. Nobody is expecting a Niall Quinn-type forward to turn up at Wolves next season and lead an intense press. But the rise in pressing gives more reason than ever before to have a player who can hold the ball up under pressure, and give the goalkeeper and defenders an option to look for with a long ball if they are struggling to play out. There are plenty of top managers who insist their players stick to playing short out of defence whatever the risk. Tottenham’s new manager Ange Postecoglou is said to actively praise players who make mistakes and lose the ball if their intention was to stick to his game plan. There is almost no room for manoeuvre on this front. Roberto De Zerbi and Mikel Arteta are two other managers who want their teams to play through the thirds every time their teams build out from the back. But you can also imagine that these managers will have seen what City did last season and could now consider going long a little more often. There are Arsenal fans out there who want a bigger striker – at least as an option in the squad – than Jesus. Both Danny Welbeck and teenager Evan Ferguson provide a physical presence up front for Brighton. Erik ten Hag wants to sign a centre-forward for Manchester United this summer, his team having looked far better with Wout Weghorst up front last season – the perfect player to provide an out ball if the defenders are being pressed and need to go long. It also just so happens that 2022-23 was the first season since 2015-16 that the top three goalscorers in the Premier League were all out-and-out number nines, rather than inside forwards. Haaland (36), Harry Kane (30) and Ivan Toney (20) were the top scorers last season, while in recent years the charts have often been dominated by wide forwards like Mohamed Salah, Son Heung-min, Sadio Mané and Raheem Sterling. In the seasons preceding 2015-16, the goalscoring charts were full of centre-forwards. The top four scorers in 2014-15 were all centre-forwards, and seven of the top eight were the season before that. You only have to go back as far as 2011-12 to find a season when the top 10 scorers were all strikers in the traditional sense. Football tactics are constantly evolving and are often cyclical in their nature. So, are the improvements in Premier League pressing going to precipitate a rise in teams happy to go a bit more direct and using a big man up top? It’s unlikely that we’ll see target men like Grant Holt – who was the eighth-highest scorer in 2011-12 – playing in the Premier League again any time soon, simply because strikers have to be able to press these days. Finding a big centre-forward who can hold the ball up, score goals and press – like Haaland, Kane or Toney – is obviously easier said than done, but forwards who can do it all are becoming increasingly common. City buying Haaland last summer could now, with the benefit of hindsight, be considered an indication of where City were headed. The fact that Guardiola signed off that purchase and, having for so long refused to let his teams do anything other than keep the ball on the floor and play out from the back, is now happy for his team to go long suggests we could be approaching a turning point. It’s not quite the return of long-ball football in the sense that we once knew it, but it may be the case that next season, with Premier League teams pressing better than ever before, others are happy to play it straight up to the big man up top.

10960,Organised Chaos: How José Luis Mendilibar Brought Sevilla to the Brink of Another European Trophy,"José Luis Mendilibar says he feels like a bit of an ‘a***hole’ with all the flattering remarks he has received lately. “I’ve been in top-flight football for 20 years and it’s like nobody knew who I was.” All it took was saving Sevilla from relegation with a remarkable run of form and beating some giants of European football on the way to a Europa League final for people to become acquainted with his name. If they didn’t already know, now they know. The 62-year-old from the Basque Country has no ‘hairs on his tongue’ as the saying goes in Spain; he doesn’t suffer fools. If football teams are built in the image of their coach then it makes sense that his teams are no-nonsense and uncomplicated. After spending six years in the top flight under Mendilibar, Eibar finally succumbed to gravity and dropped into the second division. It was a miracle that they had made it to La Liga at all and staying there for as long as they did was beyond anyone’s wildest dreams. Eibar even finished ninth during Mendilibar’s time at the club. While he was at Ipurua, no team had more high turnovers, won possession more often in the final third or hit more long passes in La Liga. But more on Mendilibar’s style in a bit. The Spaniard got the call from Sevilla in March 2023 after a 2-0 loss to Getafe left them just two points outside the relegation zone. Mendilibar said yes after a 30-minute meeting in Madrid the following day, seeing the potential that was hidden beneath a very dangerous situation. He wasn’t fooling himself either; he was acutely aware of that danger. ‘This is a club used to playing in the Champions League and winning Europa Leagues… I didn’t want to be the one to get them relegated.’ Sevilla were in a sorry state. They started the season under Julen Lopetegui despite there being clear signs at the end of the previous season that the project with the former Spain and Real Madrid manager had run its course. It was hard to say goodbye given it was a golden era of football at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan but they just held on too long. Lopetegui only lasted seven games into the current season, earning one win, a couple of draws and four losses in La Liga before he was dismissed at the start of October. Jorge Sampaoli was put in charge and the season started to slowly unravel. The Argentine lasted 31 games in total and oversaw 19 games in La Liga (W6, D5, L8). Sampaoli averaged 1.21 points per game, which was a slight improvement over Lopetegui but hardly anything to boast about. Mendilibar’s style is neither subtle nor hard to explain. It’s not particularly hard to implement either but it is hard to carry out consistently and it’s not without its risks. It was exactly what Sevilla needed. Lopetegui and Sampaoli both want to employ a highly complex, intricate style of play that focuses heavily on build-up patterns. But by the end of Sampaoli’s reign, the combination of both his and Lopetegui’s systems was like a two-storey house built by two different designers who had never met each other­. It was elaborate, for sure, and complex beyond words but it looked weird and had zero functionality. Monchi, the lauded sporting director of Sevilla, seemed to have lost his touch. The squad was a mixture of players that might have worked together in some alternative universe but clearly weren’t fit for purpose in this one. Sevilla had become an abstract rendition of a football team, more suited to a modern art museum than in a relegation scrap. Monchi wasn’t sure if the players would respond to Mendilibar’s style or whether they had the inclination to carry it out. He made the call anyway. Since he took over in March, only Atlético Madrid (eight), Real Madrid (seven) and Villarreal (seven) have won more games in La Liga (six). They are fifth for goals scored (17) and only Barcelona (nine) have conceded fewer (10). Oh, and now they’re in a Europa League final and one game away from making it back into the Champions League (albeit in a roundabout way). In a world where football tactics can seem needlessly complicated, Mendilibar is more inclined to subtract rather than add caveats to help solve problems. “Clear the ball, get it out wide and cross it before you get to the end line,” Mendilibar says. “I hear commentators say that the 4-3-3 offers superiority in midfield as if this was a game of table football.” What’s clear is that Sevilla no longer hold onto the ball for long periods of time. They’ve had just 54 sequences of possession containing 10 or more passes since Mendilibar took charge. Only four teams have had fewer over the same period, while Sevilla’s 2.78 passes per sequence puts them in the same company as relegated Espanyol and a struggling Getafe side. If those teams are clearing the ball out of necessity because of a lack of technical ability, Mendilibar does it by choice. He believes it’s the best way to score goals and the best way to keep things tight at the back. Out of possession, Mendilibar gets his side to squeeze high and chase their own long passes. Sevilla are averaging 8.5 high turnovers per game in La Liga since he took over – the fifth-highest rate in the league – while they start their sequences 42.2 metres from their own goal, the fifth furthest away.   The Europa League semi-final second leg against Juventus was the perfect encapsulation of what Mendilibar likes to do. It was combative. It was physical. No team has been involved in more duels in a single game in the Europa League this season than Sevilla’s 174. During that game, Sevilla also had the highest number of open-play crosses in the Europa League this season (49). They pressed high, got the ball out wide to the wingers and forced Max Allegri’s side into a game they were never comfortable playing. They pinned Juventus back and forced them to go long. Angel Di Maria was visibly frustrated inside the first 15 minutes at his teammates’ inability or unwillingness to hold the ball and stay calm. It’s easier said than done with a fearless front four closing space and with the Sevilla crowd baying for high turnovers. “The interiors don’t interest me,” he told Relevo. But that hasn’t stopped Ivan Rakitić, at 35 years of age, from experiencing a resurgence in form. With no place for a classic interior in the mould of Andrés Iniesta, Rakitić plays closer to Fernando Reges in a double pivot and has played his best football for a couple of years under Mendilibar. Oliver Torres is the same. Erik Lamela too. Sevilla look like a team freed from the need to overthink and scrutinise every decision in their heads at the moment they make it. They are fluid and free to chase down defenders, take a man on and take risks. There is nowhere that is more evident than on the flanks for Sevilla. “The coaches are to blame for there being no dribblers anymore, they only teach the kids how to pass the ball nowadays,” Mendilibar says. He would never forbid his players from taking someone on, something lots of managers think is too risky now. Lucas Ocampos’ first season at Sevilla was glorious. He scored 16 goals, registered four assists and helped the club lift the Europa League. Since then, it has been a backward slide into anonymity. The 28-year-old was loaned to Ajax last summer, and his connection with Sevilla and the club had petered out. He returned in the winter after it became clear that the Eredivisie wasn’t for him either. The Argentine has been unshackled under Mendilibar. Ocampos has attempted 61 take-ons (6.7 per 90) since the new manager took over, almost 20 more than the next player on the list for Sevilla during Mendilibar’s time (Bryan Gil). Gil is another player who has flourished under the new coach. According to Mendilibar, Gil is the most natural-born dribbler he has ever coached. If Mendilibar does nothing else, he has shown us what Bryan Gil can become. The 22-year-old broke onto the scene at Sevilla ready to upend the notion that old-school wingers were a dying breed. Except the flame never really took hold until recently. We haven’t seen Gil in the kind of system that might accentuate his strengths until now. Against Juventus in the second leg, he did the work of three men and constantly forced the Italian side to go long with his relentless pressing. Mendilibar only signed a contract until the end of the season, but he has exceeded his brief and earned the chance to lead this team into next season. Sevilla’s form is not without its caveats. Even the most die-hard of Sevilla fans would have a hard time keeping a straight face telling you they didn’t get lucky against Manchester United in the first leg of the Europa League quarter-finals. Their expected goal difference per 90 is -0.18 in La Liga this season, which puts them at slightly worse than league average. But this is Mendilibar’s exact point. His tactics defy traditional analysis. He’s not trying to dominate all over the field. He’s not into the idea of death by a thousand cuts. He wants to hit you where it hurts and work hard to stop you from doing the same to his side. His ideas are simple almost beyond comprehension. But fortune favours the bold. Sevilla can put their change in fortunes down to the fearless Mendilibar. He’s a man not for changing, and why would he? Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

8234,Celta Vigo recover key player from international commitments in time to face Barcelona,"Celta Vigo take on Barcelona on Saturday evening, in what will be a massive test for Rafa Benitezâs side as they aim to move away from the La Liga relegation zone. Although Barcelona are in a very poor moment currently, the Galicians have lost their last three matches at home, so thereâs no guarantee that they will be able to take advantage.  However, Benitez has been handed a boost ahead of welcoming the Catalan giants to Balaidos, as MD have reported that Jonathan Bamba will return to training with Celta on Friday ahead of the match. Bamba has been away with Ivory Coast for the last six weeks, and he helped them win their home Africa Cup of Nations, defeating Nigeria in the final last weekend. Bamba has been a key player for Celta Vigo since signing last summer. However, heâs unlikely to start against Barcelona because of his lack of training ahead of the match, although he is expected to be on the substitutesâ bench.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Celta-Vigo-recover-key-player-from-international-commitments-in-time-to-face-Barcelona/3302318,,23 hours ago,all-football-app
7934,Real Sociedad seal major coup as star signs new deal until 2029 amid EPL links,"Real Sociedad have tied down one of their best players in Japanese forward Takefusa Kubo, who signs a new deal until 2029 with the Txuri-Urdin.  Kubo moved to La Real two summers ago from Real Madrid for a little under â¬6m, although Los Blancos have retained 50% of his sell-on fee. Since he has gone from strength to strength at the Reale Arena, playing a key role in their qualification for the Champions League last season, and their progress to the Round of 16 this year. He had been linked with a move away this summer, with a â¬60m release clause looking increasingly like value for money for Europeâs giants. A new deal though should give La Real some security over his future, or at least a better negotiating position, although his release clause in the new contract is so far unclear. Liverpool and Saudi Arabia had both enquired about his availability last month, and it was beginning to look like a tricky task for La Real to retain him in the summer, although Kubo had made it clear he would not be going anywhere in January. It may be that Real Sociedad are simply increasing the asking price, but Kubo has spoken of how happy he is in Donostia-San Sebastian on numerous occasions.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Real-Sociedad-seal-major-coup-as-star-signs-new-deal-until-2029-amid-EPL-links/3300766,,12-Feb,all-football-app
11737,Iker Muniain: The Athletic Bilbao Magician out to Break His Copa del Rey Curse,"Iker Muniain carries something of a finals curse with Athletic Bilbao. In perhaps his best season ever, can he lift the Copa del Rey? It will be 10 years on 8th March since Manchester United suffered one of their most one-sided home defeats in the Alex Ferguson era. The first leg of the Europa League last 16 finished 3-2 to Athletic Bilbao, but the scoreline belied the contest. United were comprehensively out-run and outplayed, dismantled by Marcelo Bielsa’s bold, brilliant Basques. Ferguson went as far as admitting that David de Gea kept embarrassment levels to a minimum: “Our goalkeeper’s made four or five terrific saves in the game, so really, it’s not the worst result for us.” Athletic’s performance was one of the finest by an away team against United in the past 30 years. That might sound an exaggeration, but it was clear to everyone present in Manchester that night, Ferguson included. Javi Martínez, Óscar de Marcos, Ander Herrera and Fernando Llorente were four of the visitors’ standout stars, but there was barely a misstep from any of them. And one man – one teenager, to be precise – looked like he was playing a different game to everyone else. Iker Muniain scored what proved to be the winner in the closing minutes, capping a quite astonishing performance from a relatively unknown 19-year-old at the home of the reigning English champions and Champions League runners-up. He was beguiling, fearless, two steps ahead – everything you might expect from a player who had been a fixture in the first team from the age of 16. Today, Muniain has 481 appearances for the club, the eighth-most in their history. He has played under seven coaches and been integral to the plans of each. He is Athletic’s captain, their standard-bearer, the man who inspired them past Barcelona in the Copa del Rey last month with a powerhouse of a performance. He is probably playing the best football of his career. As Athletic prepare to face Real Madrid in the quarter-finals, they will hope that form continues. Muniain has finished runner-up in this competition four times, including twice last year. He lost the 2012 Europa League final, too, and the Supercopa de España two weeks ago. Now more than ever, he deserves a winner’s medal. There is something unquantifiable about Muniain’s importance to Athletic; after his two-goal performance in the 3-2 win over Barca, coach Marcelino grasped for the right words to describe his impact beyond mere numbers, eventually settling on “a huge presence” and “constancy.” But the numbers are also pretty good. In 23 games in all competitions this season, Muniain has scored four goals and set up a further six. He is on track to surpass his best return for direct goal involvements in a single season of 16, set in 2011-12. Back then, he averaged a goal or assist every 284 minutes. This term, that figure has improved to one every 186. He’s already created more chances this season than he did under Bielsa in the whole campaign a decade ago, in part because he has set-piece responsibility these days. Muniain has created at least 10 more chances (60) than any other player in La Liga this term, while his tally of 72 across all competitions is eight more than second-place Vinícius Júnior among players from Spain’s top tier. It puts him fifth among players across Europe’s top five leagues, behind Benjamin Bourigeaud (73), Bruno Fernandes (79), Thomas Müller (82) and Dimitri Payet (105). He has completed at least 14 more dribbles (41) than those players and made at least two more interceptions (19) than them, just to remind you that he’s not your average playmaker. And yet, his assist numbers feel a little low for someone who creates quite so many attacking opportunities, even though the numbers add up (his five La Liga assists this season come from an expected assists figure of 4.65). The problem perhaps lies in Athletic’s rather chronic lack of ruthlessness – something that has reared its head in recent years, including in those unsuccessful finals. Marcelino’s side have scored 21 goals from 30.9 expected goals in La Liga in 2021-22, the biggest negative difference in the competition. Their top scorer is Iñaki Williams with five goals in 22 games. There’s no Telmo Zarra, Llorente or Aritz Aduriz these days. Nobody has managed more than 15 in a season in the league since Aduriz in 2016-17 (16). It makes you wonder how high that Muniain assist count would be had he been tempted away by another club to play alongside a Karim Benzema, Robert Lewandowski or Kylian Mbappe. Of course, it’s not something the man himself has ever really considered. “San Mamés is magic, magic,” he said recently. “I’m lucky to play here, to have that feeling that runs over your whole body.” Compared with many star No. 10s, Muniain has what you might call an atypical view of his football career (when he signed his latest contract in 2018, it contained no release clause – why would he ever want to leave?). Then again, he is far from what might be called a traditional player to wear that number, the kind of static central playmaker whose primary task is to get the ball to others to do damage. One thing that sets Muniain apart is his movement with the ball. Whether working space in attack or simply keeping possession, as he did to brilliant, game-killing effect in the 120th minute against Barcelona, Muniain is devilishly difficult to dispossess. There’s a reason he was once called the Spanish Messi. Muniain is joint-11th among attacking players in La Liga with the most take-ons in the opponents’ half (57) this season, completing just over half of his overall attempts across the pitch; among that group, only Lucas Boyé (68%), Óscar Trejo (64%) and Nabil Fekir (58%) have better success rates. That dribbling tends to yield results, too: Nico González (five) is the only player in La Liga this season with more take-ons ending in a chance created than Muniain (four). Among La Liga’s forwards this season, only Vini Jr. (427), Fekir (302) and Gonçalo Guedes (283) have tallied more carries – a run of five metres or more with the ball – than Muniain (241), while Vini Jr. is the only man in that list to create more chances at the end of a carry (19 to Muniain’s 14). If you look at those chances in which the creator was also earlier involved in the build-up (nine), Muniain ranks joint-fourth in the division, again proving his importance to Marcelino’s plans goes well beyond the final pass. Athletic want their captain on the ball, and he rarely disappoints when he gets it, whether it be through bringing others into play or retaining possession until the optimum moment. As Marcelino said after the Barca match: “His decision-making, the technical ability… brutal.” Athletic’s policy of fielding only Basque players, the vast majority of them products of their own academy, is a laudable one. It’s also an ethos that sets them at a disadvantage compared to rival teams. In that context, their successes are remarkable: one of just three teams never to be relegated from Spain’s top flight, along with Barca and Real Madrid, Athletic have won eight league titles, 23 Copas del Rey and three Supercopas de España. Additionally, they lifted the 1902 Copa de la Coronación, considered the first edition of Spain’s premier domestic knockout competition. It also means they have spent much of the past three decades playing catch-up to their own illustrious past. Since the double-winning side of 1983-84, they have lifted just two trophies, both Supercopas, in 2015 and in January last year. Their best league finish since 1998 was fourth place in 2013-14, and this is their fourth successive season without European football. Yet it’s the final defeats that have hurt most. Barcelona (five times), Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid and Real Sociedad (boy, that one stung) have beaten Athletic to a trophy since 2009. Muniain has been at the club for all of them. There is little shame in those defeats. Two of them came at the hands of Pep Guardiola’s Barca, and the third was in Luis Enrique’s first term in charge at Camp Nou. Two of those Barca teams won those finals en route to the treble, and all three ended those seasons as champions of Europe. Athletic also lost to Diego Simeone’s Atlético in the Europa League final in 2012 and the runaway league leaders most recently in the Supercopa. They deserve recognition just for competing with these sides for so long. Markel Susaeta told Stats Perform last year: “It’s very difficult to play in a final with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Valencia. Their salaries are very big and have the best players in the world. “To play one final with Athletic and if you’ve grown up in the academy, it’s one of the special things you can live as a football player. There’s not many chances to win titles. It’s very, very special.” Muniain has lived it. He deserves to do so again, and this time, to lift a trophy: first for the fans at the stadium, and then on the famous Gabarra down the River Nervión. If that sounds romantic, well, this is a player who makes you love the game.

7296,Magical Mahrez the perfect role model for Grealish at Man City,"A club-record signing struggling to make an impact at Manchester City. Critics ready to write him off as a flop in his first six months at the Etihad Stadium. A maverick individualist, who cannot fit in with Pep Guardiola's team ethic and can only flourish with the freedom of being the main man. If Jack Grealish needs any inspiration of what his future at City can look like, he need only look to team-mate Riyad Mahrez. The Algeria winger faced all those accusations when he joined from Leicester City in a £60 million ($80m) deal in 2018, with plenty questioning if Mahrez was the sort of player that City needed. But Mahrez is now a crucial part of Guardiola's plans, providing a number of decisive moments in front of goal over the past 18 months that have been crucial given City's lack of a central striker. On Tuesday, it was his slinky swerve and finish that finally broke the deadlock for City in what was becoming an annoying fifth-round FA Cup clash against Peterborough United. It was the sort of strike Mahrez seems to have scored a dozen times before, whether it is at a scruffy Championship ground or the elegance of a Champions League stadium. The ✨footwork✨@Mahrez22 always finds space.@ManCity #EmiratesFACup pic.twitter.com/40eqIZuFct Squaring up a full-back, who does not know whether Mahrez will go inside or out, before dropping a shoulder to send the defender the wrong way and quickly firing a shot under the goalkeeper. ""Riyad always had this quality in the final third - he is the best we have,"" Guardiola said post-match. ""He scored a fantastic goal and we're so proud of the game he played."" That goal took Mahrez's total for the season to 19, already his best-ever campaign - even considering his heroics for Leicester in their title-winning year - and leaves him behind only Liverpool's Mohammed Salah for most goals in all competitions by a Premier League player this season. Guardiola insisted that statistics should be largely ignored ahead of the game, but it is an impressive return none the less. And Grealish cannot help but want to improve his own goal contribution numbers, so he was clearly delighted to get the second at London Road and secured a place in the quarter-finals. It was a moment of top quality too, Phil Foden dropping deep to fire a 50-yard pass that his England team-mate exquisitely pulled out of the sky before tapping home. Phil Foden ➡️ Jack Grealish = 🤩(🎥: @EmiratesFACup)pic.twitter.com/C61tkKPDMN ""I expect more, I want to get a lot more,"" Grealish said after netting just his fourth City goal, and first since mid-December. ""I’ve been speaking with the manager and he’s been helping me. ""I want to get goals and assists, but he said it’s not all about that. He’s trusted me in a lot of big games, which I feel I’ve done alright in. Hopefully that’ll come now in the big part of the season."" The relief was visible, and he was able to enjoy the final 20 minutes as he dipped into his box of tricks. Those driving runs, clever link-up play and intelligent movement that persuaded City to pay a British-record £100m ($139m) for him in the summer were all on show, and he came close to a second goal with a delicate curling effort that was tipped over by Peterborough keeper Steven Benda. ""He played really well,"" Guardiola said of Grealish. ""He had a chance in the first half that was difficult and he was more involved in the second half. ""For him and for us, it's so important he came back from injury, he felt good and he played at a really good level."" The opposition are a long way from the best he will face during his time at City, but Grealish needed a confidence boost. Now he, and City fans, will hope he can follow in Mahrez's footsteps over the next few years.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/magical-mahrez-perfect-role-model-grealish-man-city/bltc411abccb8f5080b,Jonathan Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10086,Most Goals Conceded in a Premier League Season,"Swindon Town hold the unwanted record of being the only team to concede 100 goals in a Premier League season, but could that record be challenged in 2023-24? Goals are the best thing about football, unless they’re going in your goal. Being in the Premier League is a dream for many, but it turned into a nightmare for some teams who just couldn’t stop opposition teams from scoring past them. With Sheffield United threatening to join the list in the 2023-24 campaign, we run down those who have conceded the most goals in a Premier League season since the competition began in 1992. The list will look at the highest overall totals, though it must be noted the first two teams on this list played in Premier League seasons with 42 games for each team, rather than the 38 we have now.  In just the second year of the Premier League, Swindon made a brief appearance in England’s top flight. It had its moments, with wins over Southampton, Tottenham and Coventry and they even did the double over Queens Park Rangers. However, John Gorman’s side also struggled to keep clean sheets, with just four in their 42 games. Within their first four games of the season, they had conceded five against both Liverpool and Southampton. Their back-to-back wins against Spurs and Coventry came sandwiched between conceding six at Everton and five at Aston Villa. A 7-1 defeat at Newcastle United in March was the most they conceded in one game, but an insipid farewell outing on the final day also saw them reach three figures for goals conceded, with a 5-0 loss at home to Leeds United taking it to a nice round century.  Swindon remain the only team ever to have shipped 100 goals in a Premier League season. * 42-game season 1994-95 saw Ipswich Town concede the second-most goals in a Premier League season (93), but their fans will no doubt be keen for us to point out that it’s only fourth-most in terms of goals per game. The Tractor Boys only kept three clean sheets in their 42 games, but only once did they concede more than four goals in a game. That came in their famous 9-0 defeat at Manchester United, which remains tied as the biggest margin of victory in Premier League history. Unsurprisingly, as happened with Swindon, Ipswich finished bottom. * 42-game season It remains the worst Premier League campaign of all time, with Derby amassing just 11 points in the 2007-08 season. In terms of goals per game, it is also the second-worst in the league’s history. It was an ominous start for Paul Jewell’s men, losing 4-0 at Tottenham, 6-0 at Liverpool and 5-0 at Arsenal in their first seven games. Things didn’t really get better at any point, with Derby keeping just one clean sheet in their final 28 games. Their last 10 games included a 6-1 loss at Chelsea, a 6-0 home defeat to Aston Villa and a 6-2 home loss against Arsenal. They appropriately ended the season by losing 4-0 at Pride Park to Reading. The first team in this list not to finish bottom of the league, though that presumably wasn’t much consolation for Fulham as 19th place still gets you relegated. 2013-14 was a campaign that saw three managers give it a go, but none of Martin Jol, René Meulensteen or Felix Magath could stop Fulham from conceding goals. It was more a steady stream of goals than regular thrashings, though their biggest margin of defeat was a 6-0 loss at Hull City in late December. They conceded four against both Everton and Manchester City just before Christmas, with City putting another five past them in the reverse fixture. Both Cardiff City (692) and West Ham (677) actually faced more shots than Fulham (671) in total that season, but only conceded 74 and 51 goals respectively. One of the Premier League’s most notorious ‘yo-yo’ clubs, Norwich were promoted back to the Premier League after a very strong 2020-21 season in which they won the Championship with 97 points, conceding just 36 goals in their 46 games. Expectations were high that they could finally establish themselves in the Premier League, but things frankly could not have started worse. They lost 3-0 to Liverpool and 5-0 to Manchester City in their first two admittedly difficult games, before shipping seven away to Chelsea in late October. After Dean Smith replaced Daniel Farke they still struggled to pick up points but did at least seem to stop the heavy defeats, though a 5-0 loss at home to Arsenal on Boxing Day suggested a turnaround in form wasn’t imminent. Another 5-0 home defeat to Tottenham on the final day was an appropriate way to sign off their latest brief Premier League visit. Their expected goals (xG) against total of 77.4 was 8.4 more than the next worst team (Leeds – 69.0). Like Swindon, it was one and done for Barnsley in the Premier League, though the Tykes weren’t quite as leaky at the back as the Wiltshire side. A 1-0 win away at Crystal Palace in their second game suggested Barnsley might be a tougher prospect than many anticipated, though a 6-0 home defeat to Chelsea in their next outing indicated otherwise. There was also a 5-0 loss at Arsenal, a 7-0 hammering at Manchester United and a 6-0 thrashing at West Ham to follow. Barnsley managed to avoid finishing bottom, though, with their 35 points enough to finish ahead of Crystal Palace, but relegation was still the end result. When Robbie Blake slammed in the winner for Burnley in a 1-0 victory against Manchester United at Turf Moor, Clarets fans must have been very excited about what their first Premier League campaign would bring. Despite another 1-0 win against Everton in their next game, the 2009-10 season mostly brought goals against and ultimately, relegation. Trips to Chelsea, Liverpool and Spurs saw a combined 12 goals go past them, while they also conceded five in away games against West Ham and Aston Villa. Burnley had been relatively solid at home, until 6-0 and 4-0 defeats respectively against Man City and Liverpool in the last two months of the season. They finished with 30 points and were relegated in 18th. Wolves had avoided relegation by a single point in the 2010-11 season, but it turned out they were just delaying the inevitable as Mick McCarthy and then Terry Connor were unable to keep the wolf from the door. It started well enough, with Wolves conceding just once in their first three games, but from the end of August to the middle of the following April, they didn’t keep another clean sheet in the Premier League. A 4-1 loss at Manchester United was the only time they conceded more than three in a game until an embarrassing 5-1 home defeat to rivals West Brom, which spelled the end of McCarthy’s reign. Connor oversaw 5-0 defeats away at Fulham and at home to Man Utd, and in reality, Wolves never looked like repeating their achievement of staying up as they finished with just 25 points, 12 off safety.

8341,"Middlesbrough 1-2 Bristol City: Jason Knight, Matty James seal Robins win","Two goals in two first-half minutes earned Bristol City a 2-1 win at Middlesbrough - their first of 2024 in the Sky Bet Championship. Jason Knight's cool finish in the 16th minute was followed by Matty James' drive in off the woodwork as Boro failed to get going. Bristol City's first league win since Boxing Day was enough to lift Liam Manning's side level on points with the Teessiders in mid-table. Middlesbrough did create chances and Samuel Silvera made things interesting in the closing seconds by pulling one back, without knowing much about it. But head coach Michael Carrick had to suffer another defeat, with Boro having won only one of their last seven home league games. They have also picked up just five points from the last available 15. Even though the Robins - who came through 120 minutes of FA Cup football against Nottingham Forest in midweek - had not won since Boxing Day, they were quick to make an impression. George Tanner had already volleyed into the arms of goalkeeper Tom Glover, who had also done well to dive to his right to deny Harry Cornick from hitting the opener soon after. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp The only time Middlesbrough threatened during the first half was when Hayden Hackney failed to bring the ball down quickly enough when he was picked out at the back post by Luke Ayling. And City's quickfire double came along shortly after. Defender Rob Dickie picked out Knight with an incisive through pass. With just Glover to beat, Knight turned and spun away from the goalkeeper and Lukas Engel before finding the empty net. Within two minutes Bristol City were two up. Highly-rated Hackney was at fault for gifting possession to James and the visitors' captain fired in off the post from 20 yards. Hackney tried to make amends 14 minutes later when his effort from 25 yards curled away from the far post, with goalkeeper Max O'Leary diving to cover. But City should have been three up before the break. Cornick's excellent run and pass from inside his own half put Sam Bell clear. Rather than round Glover, Bell tried to beat him with a shot and the goalkeeper was big enough to thwart. That was followed by an O'Leary low save at the other end from Finn Azaz. O'Leary had to be alert to make a strong save from Greenwood at the start of the second half after he had been picked out by Azaz in the box. The Bristol City keeper made an even better save soon after by rushing off his line to deny Greenwood, who had been played in behind by Azaz. Marcus Forss also drilled an effort on the turn narrowly wide. Middlesbrough tried different things but Manning's men defended well. O'Leary also had to make another strong save to stop Rav van den Berg's 25-yard drive from flying in. Greenwood thought he had scored with 12 minutes to go only for the officials to rule it out for a very close offside call. Middlesbrough did pull one back in stoppage-time when Azaz's shot hit the back of substitute Silvera before bouncing in but it proved too little, too late. Middlesbrough's Michael Carrick:  ""I thought there was enough in the game for us to get something. In the end we didn't start particularly well, we didn't start like us and paid the price. ""Those two quick goals gave them a massive start in the game. My players showed character and ended up playing good football, it just didn't go for us. In the end it was too much. ""We finished the first half with good signs, the boys looked like themselves and we carried that on. I still thought we looked a threat, we just didn't end up finishing it off. ""I have belief in the boys, there is s still a lot of good things going on in the game. I know they are capable of taking the chances. We have to believe it will turn."" Bristol City's Liam Manning: ""We had six changes from Wednesday and the lads put in so much to Wednesday, so we needed everybody. ""The fact we found a way to win in a variety of ways is something to learn from. I made two changes early second half too because I felt energy was going to be important. ""We played 120 minutes on Wednesday, plus the travel, it has been a relentless programme for us. We came here with no excuses and you have to max out. I enjoyed it. ""The first half plan worked. The players did a terrific job in implementing it. ""We knew they would have a lot of possession and we were happy to give them it in front of us. We did an excellent job of counter attacking. ""We did an outstanding job of competing, we had blocked shots and crosses, we showed a great togetherness second half. ""They had very few chances really. I was pleased with the second half for different reasons."" Correctly predict six scorelines to win £250,000 for free with Super 6.

Alex Balde redeemed himself for his poor performance against Real Madrid, scoring an excellent individual goal.“I'm very happy for Balde.

He has suffered some criticism, but he has to fight back against this situation.”Unlike last season, Balde is not a guaranteed starter at Barca this term.

3970,Ianis Stoica: Is Arsenal-linked wonderkid truly 'the Romanian Mbappe'?,"“I currently have €7.5 million (£6.4m/$8.5m) for Ianis Stoica,” claimed controversial FCSB owner Gigi Becali in late November when discussing bids for the club’s highly-coveted teenage forward. “But I want €10m, plus 20 per cent (from a future transfer),” he concluded, before revealing that the offer for Stoica had, in fact, been made by Arsenal. Soon video compilations and online articles were proclaiming Stoica as being ‘the Romanian Mbappe’, with Gunners fans working themselves into a frenzy over their apparent interest in a potential new young star. It is important at such a time, however, to take a step back. The reason behind Stoica’s nickname is largely down to him stating in a previous interview that he admires Mbappe as a player, and hopes to replicate some of what the France international can produce within his own game. In terms of Arsenal’s apparent interest, there has been nothing out of the Emirates Stadium that would suggest they are keen on the 19-year-old, and given Becali’s somewhat bombastic history, there is a chance that he is just looking to drive up the price for any actual interested parties. With all that said, it is not like Stoica has not deserved to have more and more fans from outside Romania take notice of him so far this season. 🇷🇴 Ianis Stoica (Attaquant, 2002, FCSB)🇷🇴La révélation inattendue de ce début de saison.Un buteur avec des qualités d'ailier, ultra mature sur et en dehors du terrain, et un physique solide à seulement 18 ans. 📈9 apparitions/ 5 buts (1 but/66 min) pic.twitter.com/eQN6BdizbF In his first full season as part of the FCSB senior squad, he has six goals to his name in all competitions, and is averaging a goal or an assist every 72 minutes that he is on the pitch. Becali has previously spoken of Stoica as being a “phenomenal prospect”, and the signs are positive that he could yet make good on the promise he showed on his headline-grabbing first-team debut some four years ago. Aged just 14 years and 322 days, Stoica both played and scored in the Romanian Cup against Sanatatea Cluj, becoming the youngest player in FCSB history in the process. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: It is likely, though, that such a debut was prearranged by Becali when he lured Stoica to his club from Freiburg, where he had a rather short spell in 2016. According to the player himself, he even impressed Bayern Munich scouts while in Germany, who in turn offered him a trial. ""I chose Steaua ahead of Bayern, because I have a better chance here,"" he said in 2018. When asked about the reasons in retrospect, the player's father, Pompiliu Stoica, claimed: ""I didn’t like the conditions at Freiburg, so we went back to Bucharest."". Given the fact that Freiburg have magnificent facilities and invest hugely in youth coaching, that is a fairly odd statement, to put it mildly.  14yo Ianis Stoica played again for FCSB last night in the Cup. A fan asked for his shirt after the game. Stoica: ""Sorry, I can't. Only the older players are allowed to give away shirts!"" Brilliant. pic.twitter.com/pwuhEdzESe Stoica Sr. was a decent player himself. Having started his career as a striker, he eventually settled as a left-back, winning two league titles in Romania with Steaua, while representing the national team on eight occasions. He also spent time playing in Russia and Cyprus, but his ties to Steaua and Becali are strong, and that is likely to have been the major motivation behind his son’s move back to his homeland. As for Ianis' hopes of progressing much faster in Romania than in Germany, they were not really realistic. After his debut, he made three further substitute appearances in the cup, only to then take in four separate loan spells before forcing himself back into contention this season. He first joined Dunarea Calarasi at the beginning of 2019, for whom he made his top-flight debut, though that proved to be only one of only two appearances for the club.  Stoica was then sent to second-division side Petrolul 52, but his father was not satisfied with him making just eight appearances, and brought him back to the capital midway through the 2019-20 season. His third spell, at another second-tier side, Metaloglobus, was also cut short, this time because of the Covid-19 restrictions at the beginning of 2020.  🇷🇴 | Ianis Stoica (2002), retour du super-sub, décisif dans ce dernier quart d'heure qui permet au FCSB de ne pas laisser CFR s'échapper.

(4⚽️, 1🅰️, 900 min)pic.twitter.com/Q5M8vvuRrV https://t.co/WJPOZkdvQ0 Finally, last season, Stoica joined minnows Slatina, who were reportedly chosen due to their ties to Romania Under-19s coach Dan Oprescu. Stoica scored seven goals there, including four in six games during the end-of-season play-off rounds, though that was not enough to save Slatina from relegation to the third division.  His form, though, did allow him the chance to prove himself in the senior FCSB squad, and it is a chance he has grasped with both hands, despite only having started four matches thus far. As well as his goals at club level, he also netted on his Romania U21s debut against Georgia in September, with his best attributes ensuring he catches the eye more often than not when on the field. Stoica is quick, loves to dribble and improvise, and feels comfortable on both flanks. Mostly used on the right, he would arguably be more dangerous on the left, cutting inside to use his stronger right foot and show off how capable he is when shooting from distance. FCSB coach Toni Petrea remarked: ""Ianis is a valuable player, but he has a lot of work to do. First he needs to play here and improve gradually, and then we would be able to talk about taking the next step to a bigger club."" Whether that bigger club proves to be Arsenal remains to be seen, but while talk of Stoica joining one of Europe’s elite or replicating the heroics of Mbappe might be premature, there is certainly talent there. It must be hoped that the building hype around him, however, does not overshadow the developments he still has to make.

159,Chelsea boss Tuchel admits 'mixed feeling' about Carabao Cup amid Ukraine crisis,"Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel admits that events in Ukraine are weighing on his conscience as he attempts to prepare for Sunday's Carabao Cup final against Liverpool.  The game will be the Blues' first outing since Russia invaded Ukraine this past week to set off a global crisis that has led to emotional statements around the football world. On Saturday, moreover, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, who is Russian, signalled his intention to step back from operations and hand over stewardship of the club to trustees.  “Clearly [the match will act as a distraction], but still, because the war is so close, so fresh, maybe it comes with a little bit of a bad conscience on Sunday,” Tuchel signalled to reporters in the build-up to the game.  “Like, are we allowed to fully engage, fully celebrate? Or would it be inappropriate? This is how I feel about it because it’s so new and fresh. It’s a mixed feeling I have to say.” Tuchel also rejected the notion that the club could use any critical voices towards it as extra motivation for Sunday's decider.  “I know what you mean and sometimes we use these things, like when a decision goes against you or you feel treated unfairly, to build this sort of mentality to protect you, your team, your staff and build a strong crew to shield yourself from the influences and unfairness from outside,"" he added. “In this case, the issue is too big.  ""I see the point but if you give it a second thought, how does it help now if we lose a football match given the situation that we have a war? This is simply not important enough and it will unfortunately not help. If it would, I am happy to lose the match.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-boss-tuchel-admits-mixed-feeling-about-carabao-cup/blt0b5323b8046dc6ec,Daniel Edwards,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

The striking new jersey combines black and gold colours for the first time in Arsenal's history, with an all-encompassing AFC graphic included that has been inspired by the club lettering visible to supporters en route to Emirates Stadium on matchdays. The kit is a tribute to the Gunners' overseas supporters - fondly dubbed the 'Little Islingtons' - and also has strong links to the Black Lives Matter movement through Aston Mack, founder of the Orlando Freedom Fighters. Mack famously wore an Arsenal shirt at a BLM demonstration in July 2020, and has said of his connection to the new strip: ""As a proud Orlando Gooner, to me, the Arsenal jersey means strength, solidarity and pride. ""When I wear the jersey, it takes me to another world. I feel protected, I feel connected, I feel part of a bigger community. I’m proud of Arsenal for presenting what our jersey means to people like me.

7591,ALVISE CAGNAZZO: Conte wants to stay in Italy after his failed stint at Spurs,"Antonio Conte is the man of desire for all the top clubs in Serie A.  He is currently out of work after his break up with Tottenham and has decided to return to live in Turin, to be close to his daughter Vittoria and her family. Today, he accompanies his daughter to school and lives surrounded by his loved ones. He decided to become a father and detoxify himself from the waste of stress. He loves the sea and now that he lives in the hills he still loves to spend his holidays between Liguria and his beloved Puglia, in Lecce. The failed experience at Tottenham, the arguments with the media and the death of great friends Giampiero Ventrone and Gianluca Vialli have profoundly changed his life. He now wants to make up for the time lost abroad to look after and raise his family, and to be close to his wife and daughter who have always lived in Turin. Conte wants to stay in Italy and would only accept a new offer from the Premier League if he was certain that he would not be able to return to Juventus, or have the chance to coach Napoli or AC Milan.  Living abroad was an exceptional educational path for him but in some way it deprived the man Antonio Conte of the simplest family desires. Now 54-years-old, he is no longer a young coach looking for glory but a mature man who wants to continue coaching without losing contact with Italy. He still has eight to 10 years ahead of him at great levels before his football goes in the same path that has already shattered Massimiliano Allegri's tactical certainties. NAPOLI DREAM OF CONTE Napoli is among the few clubs that could satisfy Conte's wishes from a planning and technical point of view because it possesses a potential Ballon d'Or winner like Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and because they want to return to the top after a unsuccessful season. Conte decided not to replace Rudi Garcia earlier this season as he no longer wants to take a team halfway through the season. His family would remain in Turin, a few hours' flight from Napoli and would not change his habits for the umpteenth time by trying to repeat the sporting miracle achieved after over 30 years by Luciano Spalletti's team last season.  Winning a scudetto in Naples is much more difficult than doing so at a top club like Juventus, Inter or AC Milan and this generates many expectations in the head of the Apulian coach. According to Tuttosport, Conte could still accept Napoli's proposal in June 2024. At the end of the season everything will be clearer on his horizon and the Neapolitan club is probably one of the best solutions. Conte is the right man when there are no international competitions and Napoli seriously risks not qualifying for any European competition. Today they are in ninth place in Serie A, closer to Torino than to Inter in the standings, and this is a sign of failure on which Conte's determination can build new triumphs.  CONTE WOULD MAKE NAPOLI FANS DREAM AGAIN Among the narrow alleys of San Gregorio Armeno, Conte would be treated like a divinity. His extraordinary charismatic energy would allow the fans to dream again after the technical disaster experienced with Rudi Garcia and Walter Mazzari - the temporary coach who has a worse points average than his French predecessor. If Conte needed love in Naples he would find it without any particular problems, without even paying too much attention to relations with the media and his polemical character would become a shield against any external attack. The city has always dreamed of having Jose Mourinho on the bench but his 'Roman nature' and the excessive cost of his ancient football would be too much of a burden to bear. This is why Conte represents the right man who could be in the right place, on the bench of the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium.   CONTE FACES DE LAURENTIIS PROBLEM - BUT CAN REBUILD TEAM WITH OSIMHEN'S MILLIONS You don't have to be overly fussy to understand how Conte in Naples would have major diplomatic problems with president Aurelio De Laurentiis. Both have a very strong character, a tough soul and an extraordinary passion for motivational dialogues. In Italy there is a very famous motto: 'Two roosters in the henhouse cannot co-exist together' and this ancient popular phrase perfectly captures the situation that every coach who approaches Napoli experiences.  In the spring, De Laurentiis and the Neapolitan club will look to satisfy the technical requests of Conte, but not the economic ones because no Italian club could shell out the same amount that he received during his time at Tottenham. Conte wants to win and to do so he needs players who are at the top of the game or very close to becoming one. The sale of Victor Osimhen this summer would cost around Â£100m and the Italian coach could manage the next transfer almost personally as he has always dreamed of. If Conte has the chance to be a complete manager, by actively choosing the players to buy, Napoli would certainly become his first choice.  CONTE IN LOVE WITH JUVENTUS In addition to Napoli, there is obviously the most fascinating and least difficult hypothesis for Antonio Conte - returning to Juventus. Conte's career as a Juventus player is full of successes with five Serie A titles, the Champions League, UEFA Cup, the Coppa Italia and the European Super Cup.  His greatest wish is that to also win the Champions League as a coach. Allegri's 405 games are a perfect snapshot of his importance in recent years for Juventus. Today, however, his time seems to have expired and his football appears to be ancient, old and frankly out of place. Against Udinese, Juventus didn't have a shot on target for 45 minutes playing at the Allianz Stadium. Conte's return to Juventus is possible, by the coach's own admission who during an interview with 'Belve' on Rai2 said he regretted leaving Juventus. Who would immediately benefit from the former Tottenham manager's return to Turin? Federico Chiesa would certainly be the happiest player in the locker room.  ONLY CONTE CAN SAVE CHIESA Chiesa has always been a fundamental player for Juventus and has always been highly appreciated by Conte. The Italian coach would not let the Italian winger be debased in the role of second striker but would tactically rebuild the team to enhance his technical characteristics. Going from 3-5-2 to 3-4-2-1 or 4-2-4, the true model of Conte's early career, would represent an upgrade for Chiesa's career.  Conte's return could be an electric shock for all the players. His presence on the bench would even be linked to the permanence of the Italian winger who would become the icon of the team's new technical course. Conte's arrival would stop the potential hemorrhage of players and would allow them to recreate a strong group from which to start again to win points and consolidate the team's growth. Chiesa would return to being a fundamental player, the future captain of the team who will enhance the tradition of the great Italian players who wore the captain's armband like Alessandro Del Piero.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/ALVISE-CAGNAZZO-Conte-wants-to-stay-in-Italy-after-his-failed-stint-at-Spurs/3301346,,14-Feb,all-football-app
4591,Juventus given stark Serie A warning: Join Super League & you're banned!,"Juventus have been warned that any attempt to revive the European Super League will see them banished from Italian football. The Serie A giants were one of the founding members of the controversial plan to start a breakaway competition that would compete with the Champions League but also likely threaten other major competitions. The plot collapsed quickly amid protests from fans and threats from football associations, with the majority of teams pulling out within 48 hours. Along with Real Madrid and Barcelona, Juventus did not give up on the idea of forming a new league and there are frequent reports that the plan could be revived. But Italian Football Federation (FIGC) president Gabriele Gravina has warned the Bianconeri against getting involved. ""That contract is a planning hypothesis. If it became a reality, Juventus would be out of the Italian league,"" Gravina told La Repubblica.  The chief admits, however, that Italian football must overcome some of the issues that the Super League was intended to resolve.  ""The Super League is the wrong answer to a real need,"" he said.  ""Italy, too, must think about how to improve the quality of the championship and make it more attractive for expanding markets such as the Arab one, where it collects little money from at the moment."" Despite the collapse of the Super League after the original announcement last year, there remains a glimmer of hope that it will go ahead eventually. La Liga president Javier Tebas claimed this week that the three teams holding on to the idea - Juve, Barca and Madrid - are plotting a new iteration of it that will not include the Premier League teams initially involved. Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City, Tottenham, and Liverpool all disowned the idea amid the backlash and Tebas claims they will be excluded in the next attempt to get it up and running. “It continues to exist. They give a lot of importance to what the EU could solve, but the European governments have already positioned themselves,"" Tebas said.

The defender was seen to have slapped and kicked the animal on video that gained circulation before Tuesday's match with Watford, with David Moyes still starting the 27-year-old in that game amid widespread furore. Zouma was named in the starting XI for the Hammers' trip to the King Power Stadium, only to pull out of the team at short notice. News broke that Zouma had been removed from Moyes' matchday squad at short notice when the club issued a short message on social media less than a quarter-hour before kick-off. ""Issa Diop will replace Kurt Zouma in the starting XI, as he is unwell,"" West Ham wrote. ""Darren Randolph is added to the substitutes' bench."" Issa Diop will replace Kurt Zouma in the starting XI, as he is unwell.Darren Randolph is added to the substitutes' bench.#LEIWHU https://t.co/zxKoSa5094 After the game ended in a 2-2 draw, Moyes told Sky Sports: ""[Zouma] was ill before the game, wanted to play, we wanted him to play as well. He was sick during the night, he stayed away from the players and did not eat much.  ""Once he got out [for warm-ups] he did not think it was possible. We told Issa Diop to be ready. It is a stomach bug, probably something he has eaten."" Moyes' choice to field Zouma - despite condemning the player's actions - has sparked significant fallout around London Stadium, with suspended sponsorship deals for both player and club. Moyes has spoken of handing the former Chelsea man ""a second chance"" following his actions while the RSPCA - who took custody of Zouma's cats following the incident - have refuted claims that the club has made a donation to their cause. Moyes address the continuing controversy after the game, saying: ""I hope that we have changed a bit of how West Ham is perceived, but more on the pitch. We have a good, exciting young team that we are trying to improve.  ""West Ham have done great work down the East End of London, young supporters coming in and a lot of good things being done. We should not allow something like this to blight what has gone on.  ""A mistake has been made and there are managers with players who have made mistake. You want to feel there is forgiveness and an apology has been made.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/zouma-removed-from-west-ham-lineup-at-leicester-after/blt51ce7cc9e80c12dd,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4981,"The best Premier League debuts: New Man City hero Haaland, Arsenal's Saliba, Aguero, Ronaldo & more","It would be easy to ask who writes Erling Haaland's scripts after his two goal showing against West Ham got his career as a Manchester City player off to a flier, but this was a debut rooted in a reality we all knew was coming. Haaland is the real deal, and any doubts after he drew a blank against Liverpool were quickly dispelled.  His overall showing against the Hammers was a microcosm of his career to date. His movement is world class when he is losing defenders in the box, he drops deep with ease, his teammates constantly looked for him, and his play with his back to goal is ruthlessly efficient. When he raced onto Kevin De Bruyne's pass in the 65th minute, opened his body, and slotted home with that sledgehammer left foot, the coolness in front of goal that he became famous for in Germany was there for all to see. The sound you heard? Opposition fans the world over collectively cursing his smooth transition.

9195,'That's a big question': Van Dijk uncertain of his Liverpool future after Klopp leaves,"Virgil van Dijk was asked whether he will be a part of Liverpool's next era after Jurgen Klopp leaves this summer.“That’s a big question,” the 32-year-old replied. “Well, I don’t know.”When reminded that he only has 18 more months left on his contract, he said: “That is correct — good maths. Listen, I don’t know.“The club will have a big job on their hands. That is well known. To replace the manager and replace not only the manager, the staff is leaving, and there are so many things that will change. ""So the club has a big job on its hands and I am very curious which direction that will go in. But when that will be announced we will see our situation. I can’t say much about it.""“Obviously it will be the end of Jürgen Klopp’s era,” he added. “I am very glad that I am still part of it. That is why I don’t like to speak about it. I am still part of it.“That is my main focus and we will see at the end of the season. Hopefully, we have the success that we all dream of and fight for each day and, by then, there will probably be more clarification for what the club wants for the future and then we will see.”'Let's give him the farewell he deserves': Van Dijk breaks silence on Klopp exit",https://tribuna.com/en/news/liverpoolfc-2024-01-29-thats-a-big-question-van-dijk-uncertain-of-his-liverpool-future-after-klopp-leaves/,Gursher Chabba,2024-01-29T12:16:33.000Z,The Times
8274,How Saudi clubs are disrupting European football,"Although the NASL collapsed in 1984, the idea of raising the profile of a football league by signing older stars seeking a final payday (and a more relaxed level of competition) has been replicated elsewhere. Some of these leagues have flourished and gone on to develop local talent (Japan, Australia), whereas others have crashed and burned (China). The latest country to have a go is Saudi Arabia, whose revamped and highly lucrative Pro League is shaking up the economics of European football. In June the Saudi Arabian government announced that its sovereign wealth fund had acquired a 75% stake in four of the league’s 18 teams: Al-Hilal and Al-Nassr in Riyadh, and Al-Ahli and Al-Ittihad in Jeddah. The Public Investment Fund (PIF) is co-ordinating the acquisition of players based in Europe, of whom it aims to place at least three at each of these clubs. Four state-owned entities have invested in another four teams. The PIF argues that its involvement in football is part of a broader project to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil and to promote physical activity among citizens. In 2021 it bought an English Premier League club, Newcastle United, and Saudi Arabia is widely expected to bid to host the World Cup in 2030, perhaps as the dominant partner in a joint bid. Critics see the government’s investments in football, as well as in boxing, Formula One and golf, as an attempt to draw attention away from its dismal human-rights record. For wealthy European clubs, second-tier leagues in far-flung destinations have been relatively unimportant. They offer lucrative places to tour and suitable employers onto whom to offload fading stars on high-wage contracts. The transfer of Cristiano Ronaldo to Al-Nassr in late 2022 was greeted with a sigh of relief in the red half of Manchester. Chelsea have trimmed their bloated roster by selling three squad players to Saudi clubs. The wages on offer in the Middle East far exceed those on offer in the Premier League. Mr Ronaldo’s salary, including commercial agreements, is reportedly $200m per year. It appears, though, that the PIF’s ambitions extend further than taking Europe’s cast-offs. The most interesting signing so far this summer is that of a 26-year-old Portuguese midfielder, Rúben Neves. He moved from a mid-table Premier League team, Wolverhampton Wanderers, to Al-Hilal. Mr Neves, who was the club captain and has been a regular with the Portuguese national team, is entering his prime years. That he has opted to spend a chunk of these playing in a league of lower quality challenges the assumption of most clubs and fans that professionals will seek to play at the highest level they can. For Mr Neves, the transfer is a sacrifice of sorts. He is believed to earn much more money in Saudi Arabia, but his career at the highest level may have ended. Had he stayed in England, he could possibly have played for a club in the UEFA Champions League, Europe’s most prestigious competition. If he seeks a move back to Europe, clubs of the same calibre may not be interested in him. He could lose his place in the Portuguese team. The move also highlighted European clubs’ vulnerabilities. Wolves are far from minnows. They are the world’s 25th-richest team by revenue, according to Deloitte, an accounting firm. Yet the PIF presented them with a clear choice. They could accept £47m ($60m) for their star player or hold on to him for one more year until his contract expired, and then lose him for nothing. The number of clubs with either the status or resources to resist the PIF is very small. Consider also Marcelo Brozovic, a 30-year-old Croatian midfielder, who captained Internazionale in the Champions League final five weeks ago. After eight years in Milan he wanted a new challenge. Barcelona had been keen to sign him, but their contract offer was eclipsed by Al-Nassr’s, and Mr Brozovic chose to head east. It isn’t just that European clubs are struggling to keep hold of their existing players. Teams of all sizes—no one, after all, is more prestigious than Barcelona—may have to rethink their recruitment plans. Players are still only trickling towards Saudi Arabia. But the summer transfer window does not close until the end of August, so for the next few weeks, and then again during transfer windows to come, European football clubs will look eastwards with concern. The PIF will continue to eye up well-known players—in particular if Saudi Arabia wins the right to part-host the World Cup in 2030, an outcome that would intensify the government’s focus on football. Much will be revealed in the next few years. Speculation abounds of Saudi Arabia’s lofty hopes: of entering its clubs in an expanded Champions League, or of reviving and expanding the reviled idea for a European Super League. For now, though, and for the first time, an upstart league is posing a genuine challenge to Europe’s stranglehold on the world’s brightest talents. © 2023, The Economist Newspaper Limited.

6819,FIFA franchise to rebrand as EA Sports FC as video game giant set to end partnership with world football's governing body,"EA Sports have announced that they will rebrand their FIFA video game series as EA Sports FC, ending a three-decade partnership with world football's official governing body. The media developer, who have handled production of the popular series of football games since 1993's FIFA International Soccer, confirmed the changes would come following the release of their next edition FIFA 23, later this year. The game series, among the best-selling franchises of all-time, has emerged as the dominant football genre experience under EA's stewardship, but the company says that it is time for a fresh chapter. ""[We] want to start by thanking this incredible community of more than 150 million fans for helping build the world’s biggest football entertainment platform,"" read an official statement from company executive vice president Cam Weber. ""After nearly 30 years of creating genre-defining interactive football experiences, we will soon begin an exciting new era. ""Next year, EA SPORTS FC will become the future of football from EA SPORTS. Alongside our 300+ license partners across the sport, we’re ready to take global football experiences to new heights, on behalf of all football fans around the world. ""Everything you love about our games will be part of EA SPORTS FC – the same great experiences, modes, leagues, tournaments, clubs and athletes will be there. Ultimate Team, Career Mode, Pro Clubs and VOLTA Football will all be there. ""This new independent platform will bring fresh opportunity – to innovate, create and evolve. This is much more than just a change of symbol - as EA SPORTS, we’re committed to ensuring EA SPORTS FC is a symbol of change. [We] look forward to sharing more detail on these plans in the coming months."" Within the statement, EA Sports confirmed that the new project would launch in 2023, meaning that the expected next edition of the FIFA series - FIFA 23 - can be anticipated to be released as planned. The edition will likely prove a swansong for the franchise, which sits alongside Mario, Pokemon, Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty and Sonic as the most popular and enduring icons of video game history. Further details will likely come over the next few months, but EA Sports have already promised that their final FIFA game will be the most expansive edition of the series to date.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fifa-franchise-to-rebrand-as-ea-sports-fc-as-video-game/blt36282a2745022834,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11671,Goodnight Azzurri,"Disaster is never far behind triumph in Italian football. Italy won the World Cup in 1982 and failed to qualify for the Euros in 1984, before going out in the first knock out round at Mexico 1986. Following World Cup victory in Germany in 2006, they went out two years later in the continental competition in the quarter-finals after winning just one game and then again in 2010 in South Africa after failing to win any games in a group that contained Paraguay, New Zealand and Slovakia. Failure to qualify for Qatar 2022 therefore was always a possibility. A flaw in the Azzurri DNA that sees celebration turn to loss of focus and hunger. The first three games of the 2022 World Cup qualifiers saw Roberto Mancini’s team win all of them without conceding a single goal. But after the Euro 2020 final at Wembley, they drew four out of five allowing Switzerland to overtake them. This morning though, Italians are waking up wondering if success last summer was actually the exception, an unexpected mirage, and that the real level of Italian football nowadays is reflected by two failed World Cup qualification campaigns that have terminated in play-off defeats to Sweden and North Macedonia. One thing is certain, managing the Italian national team is not getting any easier. Since Marcello Lippi won the biggest prize in football in Berlin in 2006, the pool of Italian talent to choose from has been shrinking year after year in Serie A. And while Lippi and his successors (Roberto Donadoni, Cesare Prandelli, Antonio Conte and Giampiero Ventura) had been accused of relying too much on age and experience, Mancini has at least been brave enough to include some youngsters in his squad. Considering how their 2022 World Cup aspirations ended, it won’t matter. The same critics will be questioning his judgement now that Italy won’t be present in Qatar in November. Not only has the overall presence of Italian players in Serie A got smaller but among the top clubs, the phenomenon is even worse. Mancini has been forced to call up players from teams with less international experience than his predecessors, picking players from smaller sides like Sassuolo, Cagliari and Torino. Looking just at Atalanta, Fiorentina, Inter, Juventus, Lazio, Milan, Napoli and Roma: But what will really worry the Italian Federation is that the problem runs even deeper. Looking at Serie B and at the top youth tournament, Campionato Primavera 1, the number of Italian players has reduced there as well, leaving any future manager with a limited supply line of fresh talent. Since their quarter-final win over Belgium in Euro 2020 and excluding the match against Lithuania where Italy won 5-0, the Azzurri have managed to score more than one goal in a game just once, in a Nations League game vs. Belgium. Their deficiencies in the final third were again evident on Thursday night. Italy managed 32 attempts but landed just five of those on target. North Macedonia, with an xG of just 0.17, booked their play-off final place against Portugal for next week. Roberto Mancini will be left scratching his head wondering how and if he will be able to do it all over again.

4155,Tottenham given transfer boost after club confirm £150m cash injection,"Antonio Conte is set to get major backing in the transfer market after Tottenham’s majority shareholders ENIC Sports Inc agreed to pump £150 million ($185m) into the club. The news comes just two days after Spurs secured a fourth-place finish in the Premier League to qualify for next season’s Champions League. Conte has previously indicated his desire to have funds to spend this summer and this announcement suggests he is going to get his wish. In a statement Tottenham said the £150m would be raised via “the issue of convertible A Shares and accompanying warrants.” It added the investment “represents permanent capital, with no ongoing interest cost to the club"" and would provide them with “greater financial flexibility and the ability to further invest on and off the pitch.”  The north London side completed the construction of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium 2019 and have also invested considerably in the club’s training ground in recent years. “The delivery of a world-class home was always a key building block in driving diversified revenues to enable us to invest in the teams and support our ambitions to be consistently competing at the highest levels of European football,” said Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy. “Additional capital from ENIC will now enable further investment in the club at an important time.’’ Jonathan Turner, Tottenham’s independent non-executive director, added: “We are pleased to welcome this investment which demonstrates the unequivocal support and commitment of our majority shareholder, ENIC. It is a timely injection of funds to ensure we can continue to grow the club we all love and underlines the Board’s continued ambitions for success.” The news is likely to be a huge boost for Conte, who was appointed Spurs boss in November with the club eighth in the Premier League. He appeared to question his future after a defeat at Burnley in February but a run of eight wins from their final 11 games saw them pip rivals Arsenal to fourth place.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tottenham-given-transfer-boost-after-club-confirm-gbp150m/blt7c266f7471e8a9f5,Tom Mallows,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3376,In-form De Bruyne stepping up to lead Man City’s fight against ‘same stuff’ Champions League failures,"Kevin De Bruyne couldn’t hide his frustration when Manchester City crashed out of the Champions League to mid-table Ligue 1 side Lyon two years ago. “Different year, same stuff,” was his honest response following the shock quarter-final defeat in Lisbon. That was the latest in a line of miserable exits and hard-luck stories that have kept City waiting to get their hands on the European trophy. Away-goal exits to Monaco and Tottenham, refereeing controversies against Liverpool, a semi-final defeat to Real Madrid, when they failed to threaten in a 1-0 loss – there have been plenty of draining disappointments. Last year was as close as City got, making it all the way to the final and a clash with a Chelsea side that finished 19 points behind them in the Premier League. But there was to be more pain, literally for De Bruyne when he was forced off early with a fractured nose and eye socket and concussion, in a flat 1-0 defeat. Many of City’s most recent legends – Sergio Aguero, David Silva and Vincent Kompany for example - have left the club without securing a Champions League winners’ medal and, turning 31 in June, the race is on for De Bruyne to ensure he doesn’t follow them. A major part of Belgium’s golden generation that has been regularly the top-ranked nation in the world but failed to win an international trophy, De Bruyne deserves to win one of the major honours. At City now, he’s leading the challenge for a treble, with the Champions League trophy remaining the one that the club covets more than any other. Pep Guardiola’s side head to Spain for their quarter-final second leg with Atletico Madrid holding a slender 1-0 advantage, courtesy of a De Bruyne strike in the first leg. And the City boss is thankful to have such a creative force that can make a difference, particularly against risk-averse Diego Simeone, who lined his side up in an already infamous 5-5-0 formation that failed to produce a single shot at the Etihad Stadium. The Premier League champions fared little better, although they at least tried to be creative, and when Phil Foden carved open the best opportunity, De Bruyne slotted the ball past Jan Oblak. His opening goal in the thrilling 2-2 draw with Liverpool on Sunday was his sixth goal in six games and, without an orthodox striker, De Bruyne – so often the player that lays on opportunities for his team-mates – has stepped up to make the difference with key contributions. “I like that he is a player who does not just make a lot of assists, he is scoring a lot. I told him he has to score more goals to reach another stage,” Guardiola said on Sunday. “He is scoring a lot of goals and making chances, knowing the position he is playing is so difficult against Liverpool because they are so narrow. And his vision for the last pass is exceptional. “It’s true he struggled in the first part of the season a lot with the injuries from the Champions League final and the European Championship.” Guardiola believes that De Bruyne is back playing at his highest level, whilst acknowledging exactly what a standard that is. From a fifth-minute opener to a stunning 94th-minute pass that gave Riyad Mahrez the chance to snatch a victory against Liverpool, his full qualities were on show. The incredible range of passes, the leadership that exudes confidence and an astonishing work rate, De Bruyne led from the front in a clash between the two best clubs in England, and possibly the two best sides in Europe, with both on a collision course for the Champions League final in Paris. “If a team comes here to play, it is always a good game and Liverpool came here to play the way they play, so that's why it has always been good,” he told reporters after the match. Liverpool were open and attacking but finding that same space against such a well-disciplined Atletico side is far more difficult with the Spanish champions the masters of keeping games tight and happy for both sides to have few chances. De Bruyne is expecting a different game at a passionate Wanda Metropolitano, although Simeone may not want to gamble too early. “Some games are tough – against Atletico, where you play against such a defensive wall, it is not the best game to play or watch,” he said. “There's nothing we can do about it. “I think it will be a little bit tight at the beginning. Depending on the score, it has to change if it stays this way but I don't expect it to be a similar game.” It will be the third of a critical run of four matches with Liverpool again in an FA Cup semi-final on Saturday. De Bruyne is no stranger to punishing schedules but conceded it was tough in the early part of the season as he recovered from an ankle injury suffered during the Euros. The commitment as ever was there – and he slumped to the floor with fatigue after an injury-time winner at Arsenal at the turn of the year. But he's ready for the final push. “Even if you wanted to, you don't have the time to think about it,” he added. “Monday is a recovery day, Tuesday we leave for Madrid and it is the same for the cup game. “It would have been nice to think about the end of the season but you don't get the time. That is maybe a good thing because you just play, play, play and then we will see what happens.” There’s no time for a break – not with a first-ever Champions League to win.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/de-bruyne-stepping-up-man-city-fight-champions-league/bltccdd5027f87de3c8,Jonathan Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8383,Roy Keane slams 'disgraceful' West Ham as Paul Merson says 'Under-10s defending' led to heavy Arsenal defeat,"Roy Keane and Paul Merson gave a withering assessment of West Ham's performance as Arsenal ran riot in their 6-0 thrashing of their London neighbours at the London Stadium. The Hammers suffered their joint-heaviest home defeat in league history - the only other time they have lost by six goals in the top flight came back in December 1963 against Blackburn Rovers (8-2). David Moyes' side were blown away during a 15-minute period towards the end of the first half in which the Gunners scored four goals. West Ham fans were seen leaving the stadium early in droves after William Saliba's headed opener was added to by a Bukayo Saka penalty and further finishes from Gabriel Magalhaes and Leandro Trossard. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking at half-time, Keane told Sky Sports: ""There are ways to lose a football match - West Ham have not turned up. ""They have not been physical, they are not tackling, no desire, no hunger, they look old and sluggish, they are not tracking back, no one has laid a glove on (Martin) Odegaard. ""Moyes must be fuming at half-time, but all credit to Arsenal, they look sharp and at it and have turned up. Live Premier League table Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! ""West Ham, though, a disgrace... shocking. I'm really frustrated with them. Arsenal are making the most of it. One or two touch, no one gets near them. Beautiful finish. Four nil. ""I can't believe what I'm watching. The way they get beaten physically, set-pieces... West Ham the last 10 or 15 minutes have been an absolute disgrace."" It did not get any better for the hosts after the break as Saka added his second goal before Declan Rice crowned a virtuoso display on his second outing back on familiar territory. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Rice did not celebrate his stunning strike against his former club, but it was hugely satisfying after some sections of the West Ham fans booed him during Arsenal's Carabao Cup defeat at the London Stadium earlier in the season. This time around, however, Rice was applauded off the pitch moments later as those who stayed on both sides of the divide appreciated the quality of his display. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  For only the second time in the Premier League, a side managed by Moyes conceded 6+ goals in a home game - both instances came in matches against Arsenal (also Everton 1-6 Arsenal in August 2009). There would be no consolation for the home spectators who stayed seated until the bitter end - and Keane was equally scathing after the final whistle. ""It was too easy,"" Keane added. ""West Ham looked shell-shocked. At some stage, your pride has to kick in. For Rice's goal, there were two or three players lining up to take the shot. West Ham really let their manager down today. ""For Arsenal, it's all positives off the back of last weekend. They've just had to keep that momentum going. To score six goals away from home is fantastic. ""We can criticise West Ham all we want but credit to Arsenal. They were efficient, they were strong. The way they won the game with their set-pieces and aerial threat. ""They could have scored a few more goals."" Sky Sports' Paul Merson: ""Defending wise, if that happened in Under-10s football you'd be going, 'seriously?!' ""Not getting tight, showing them inside on to their proper foot, it is poor, I just think Arsenal made West Ham surrender and that is quite sad as a player as that is the one thing you do not want to do. ""There is ways of losing football matches, that is a horrible way and I feel sorry for David Moyes as that is not a Moyes team out there, they have let him down today. They work hard and the one thing you do not get done at West Ham is by set-plays, and they were poor with them today. ""For Arsenal, it is just a massive result, it has done the goal difference the world of good - if this was Man City today who had won that game 6-0, we would be waxing lyrical. ""They have literally made West Ham surrender, they turned up, started well and carried it on and kept on going. ""A brilliant, brilliant result by Arsenal. They are now putting their chances away and working hard. If you want to win the Premier League, you have to bounce back [from defeats] as quickly as you can and they have done that. That is what Man City do and they have worked hard and been hard to beat. ""And fair play to them, they are right in this title race."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  When West Ham beat Arsenal and Manchester United in December, there was talk of a Champions League challenge. They have lost to both in the past eight days, shipping nine goals in the process, and are still without a win in 2024. Alarm bells might not be ringing for Moyes just yet, but the sight of fans leaving at half-time told a sorry tale and the Scot cannot keep dining out on last season's Europa Conference League success forever. Moyes told Sky Sports: ""Yes, it certainly is [up there as one of the most disappointing days as manager of West Ham]. It's one of those days which you don't want to happen very often, and it happened today. ""It's not been like my teams in the past. I'll take a bit of time and look at it and see if I can fix it. I take the responsibility, I pick the team but the players have to take responsibility. ""It's really important we do those jobs really well. We will always try to be as well organised as we can be. Arsenal were very good - we mustn't take that away. We weren't good."" When the images of fans leaving the ground at half-time were put to him, Moyes added: ""I'm a football supporter... I understand that. I don't think the direction the club is heading in is the wrong direction. It's grown greatly since we came in. We were fighting relegation. We're not fighting relegation today. ""We were playing one of the top teams in the country who we took three points off earlier in the season so I have to say the club is in a really good place. We've had setbacks through the season and we'll try and come back from this one the best we can."" Player-of-the-match Saka told Sky Sports: ""We were 4-0 up in the first half and we could have scored more. We smelt blood today and went for the kill."" Martin Odegaard added: ""It was a brilliant performance. From start to end we dominated and controlled everything. Today, we were really sharp in front of goal. I'm proud of the team. Coming from a big game [against Liverpool] and a big win and backing it up today with a great performance. ""We are focusing on ourselves. We don't care too much about the other teams. We keep working hard. It's a good win but we move on."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  This was Arsenal's joint-biggest win in a London derby in league competition, with all three of those ending 6-0. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta told Sky Sports: ""I'm extremely happy. The way we performed, the way we played. Such a big score in a really difficult place tells you a lot about how well the boys played today. ""It's great to make [club] history especially the way we have done it. We're in a good moment and when you have good moments you have to build and maintain the momentum. The team from the beginning looked really sharp. We had to put right the last two results against them and that was a good motivation for the boys. ""When you talk about consistency at his [Bukayo Saka] age...what he has done in the last two or three seasons is remarkable. His attitude, his quality, what he delivers every week...it's really difficult to find. That's why he is so important to us. ""It's always difficult to come back to your old club. The fans were really good to him [Declan Rice]. When he went to take the corner they clapped him so it's great to see that kind of reception. He loves this club so much and I know what it meant to him to play today. ""We have to share the goals. That desire and that commitment to get into the box to make things happen, it was excellent."" West Ham and Arsenal are back in Premier League action next Saturday, with both games kicking off at 3pm. West Ham travel to Nottingham Forest on February 17, while Arsenal travel to Burnley.

3165,Messi matches record for most missed penalties in Champions League history,"Lionel Messi has matched Thierry Henry's record for most missed penalties in Champions League history while surpassing Cristiano Ronaldo for most penalty attempts. He's missed five of 23 penalty attempts in the competition, with his latest coming in Paris Saint-Germain's last-16 win over Real Madrid on Tuesday. Thibaut Courtois dove the right way to deny Messi after Kylian Mbappe had won the spot kick. For most of the first leg between European heavyweights, goalscoring chances were rare outside of Messi's saved penalty, as Real Madrid were mostly content to sit back and defend at the Parc des Princes. ""In these kinds of games you know that, as a goalkeeper, you're going to have quite a bit to do,"" Courtois told BT Sport.  ""I'd studied Messi's penalties a lot and I tried to play with him when I was on the line. You've also got to have that little bit of luck, too."" COURTOIS SAVES MESSI'S PENALTY. 🧤 pic.twitter.com/eo1krKPwkA However, PSG broke through in stoppage time to win 1-0, with Kylian Mbappe shooting through the legs of Courtois. Messi has struggled at times in his debut season with PSG, though he recently has had four goal involvements in his past four games. And it was Mbappe who carried the main load on Tuesday, scoring a fine individual goal to win the match in stoppage time.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-matches-record-for-most-missed-penalties-in-champions/blt27d664a4b7ba83ed,Dan Bernstein,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8263,COLUMN: Atletico Madridâs secret weapon arrives just in time for Champions League clash with Inter,"Before Pablo Barrios this season, the last under-21 player to log 1,000+ minutes in a single campaign for Atletico Madrid was Joao Felix in 2019-20. As youâll no doubt recall, that was season one for Felix in Madrid following his â¬126m move, and the dawn of what many thought would be a new superstar of the game.  In other words, it usually requires pretty unique circumstances for Diego Simeone to give prominence to young footballers. Given the lack of examples in recent times, when a player like Barrios does emerge itâs a pretty good clue that heâs been marked as an exceptional case, and that your interest should be piqued. Perhaps the most important caveat of Barriosâ rise this season is that itâs come against the backdrop of disruption. He missed a month through injury between September and October, while a meniscus tear suffered against Feyenoord in November then kept him out for just short of two months. In a campaign where it seems like Simeone hasnât been entirely sure what to do with the third central midfield spot (accompanying Koke and Rodrigo De Paul), a healthy Barrios would have been in line for more prominence than heâs already had. And with over 1,000 minutes to his name in such circumstances, thereâs every chance he would have been a fixture in midfield by now, minus those injury setbacks. That Barrios tends to be involved whenever possible isnât merely down to ability. Of course, it helps, but the growing matter of compatibility between player and team is a big factor too. As his talent comes to the fore, thereâs now (conveniently) a greater need for it than at any other time in the Simeone era. Take their recent 1-1 draw against Real Madrid, for example. Though Atletico clearly intended to approach the game with relative caution and prioritise their defensive shape early on, the home sideâs 62% possession in the opening half hour quickly became suffocating. Where once the idea might have been to simply accept the pattern of territory, heighten the aggression from a deeper defensive shape, and look to claw their way back into the game through counter-attacks, Atleticoâs reaction was channelled in a much different way. To observe Diego Simeone in the opening half hour was to see a man pleading for only one thing: the ball. His repeated message of âtranquiloâ through words and gestures was a request for calm, but more specifically, the calmness to be able to find their football. More than ever under the Argentine there is an onus on his team to be the protagonists, and that requires specific attributes in specific areas of the pitch. Firstly, to be able to construct the type of football they want and have control of the game. And secondly, to be able to move the game forward and be effective once the conditions are there. Atletico are averaging 13.3 sequences of 10+ passes per game in LaLiga this season; a considerable jump from the 2019-20 campaign when Joao Felix first arrived (7.7), and the point at which the teamâs impending evolution really started to become a topic. Koke, meanwhile, is averaging 87 passes per 90 and completing 92% of those in LaLiga this season â by far his two highest marks in a single campaign as it stands. Viewed within what has happened in recent seasons, the fast-tracking of Barrios in this brave new world for Atletico becomes pretty clear. Itâs not that the 20-year-old is a generational passer, whoâs just so happened to land at the point in which Atletico are well on the way to diversifying their possession play. What Barriosâ natural game brings, however, is a blend of dynamism and technical ability that makes him a problem solver within the teamâs current intention. Even at this early stage of his career, Atletico have a need for his capacity of association. Whether itâs through passing, carrying, or movements off the ball, the youngster already figures as someone who can knit play together across every third of the pitch. The cherry on top of that is his ability to take off on the dribble, which heâs learning to do with increasing efficiency.
Barrios is averaging 2.8 successful take-ons per 90 in LaLiga this season; the most of any Atletico player. At the same time he not only has the best take-on success rate in his side, but across La Liga as a whole (78%), having completed 28 of his 36 attempts in the competition this term.  While dribbling is a characteristic most associated with wingers in todayâs game, and the preferred tool for creating individual advantages in many of the elite teams, for Barrios it speaks more to his comfort in navigating midfield traffic. Indeed, in the age of needing solutions to opposition pressure, the youngster is as much an escape artist as he is advantage creator. Though he retains the latter â especially when playing as an interior and not filling in for Koke â moulding his way of playing into an all-round midfield presence is the task that heâll need to continue to refine. The prize for both Simeone and Barrios, should that reach a point of completion, will be to add the characteristics of a no. 10 in the silhouette of an all-terrain midfielder. âHeâs a boy thatâs grown up as a âllegadorâ from midfield and he has that impulse to carry the ball towards the penalty area to shoot or assist,â said Spain U21 coach Santi Denia, speaking back in September. âI donât like to curb the players because you take away their natural characteristics. What [Barrios] has to do is learn to pick his moments when to let himself go.â Itâs worth remembering that Barrios has only started 15 games in La Liga to date, while heâs only played the full match on five occasions. For all the promise heâs shown in his first eight months in the senior setup, his biggest improvements will only be achieved by playing and competing on a weekly basis across multiple years. But having already worked his way into Simeoneâs plans at 20 years of age, one might say the biggest barrier has already been surpassed.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/COLUMN-Atletico-Madrid%E2%80%99s-secret-weapon-arrives-just-in-time-for-Champions-League-clash-with-Inter/3301342,,14-Feb,all-football-app
10365,Arsenal vs Lens: Prediction and Preview,"We look ahead to Wednesday’s UEFA Champions League action with our Arsenal vs Lens prediction and preview. Can Mikel Arteta’s side book their place in the last 16? It has been a solid Champions League group-stage campaign for Arsenal, winning three of their four games in Group B. Their only hiccup came in a 2-1 defeat in Lens. On Wednesday, they have a chance for revenge, as well as the opportunity to cement their place in the knockout stage. Arsenal will advance if they avoid defeat, and will go through as group winners with a win, or if they avoid defeat and PSV also fail to win at Sevilla. Lens have been a thorn in Arsenal’s side before, though, with the Gunners having never beaten them in a Champions League match in three attempts (D1 L2). It is the most times they have faced an opponent in the competition without winning. Mikel Arteta has a good record in European games on home soil. Since losing his first European home game in charge of Arsenal in February 2020 (2-1 vs Olympiakos in the UEFA Europa League), Arteta has only had one defeat in his last 12 such games at Emirates Stadium (W8 D3) and has won five of the last six (D1). Arsenal lead the Premier League, and have scored a significant number of goals in the league from set-pieces. In the Champions League, though, all nine of their goals so far have been from open play, with only Atlético Madrid and Bayern Munich scoring as often from open play in the first four matchdays (also nine). Their passing game is working wonders on the continent, having made 50 passes that have broken the opposition’s defensive line in the Champions League this season. Only reigning European champions Manchester City (59) made more across the first four matchdays. Bukayo Saka eventually unlocked a resolute Brentford defence with a cross for Kai Havertz’s winner on Saturday, and the England international has also assisted three goals in four appearances in the Champions League this season. No English player has ever assisted more than three goals in a single campaign in the competition for Arsenal. The Gunners are likely to be put under pressure by Lens, though; quite literally. An impressive 73% of touches taken by Lens’ opponents in the Champions League this season have been while under pressure from the French side. Only Ligue 1 rivals Paris Saint-Germain (74%) had a higher percentage for the share of pressures applied to all touches by the opposition over the first four matchdays. Stability in selection has helped see Lens recover from a very wobbly start to the campaign in which they lost four of their first five league games after finishing second in Ligue 1 last season. They sit in third place in Group B heading into Matchday 5, level on points with PSV in second. Four different outfield players have played every minute for Lens in the Champions League this season (Facundo Medina, Jonathan Gradit, Salis Abdul Samed and Kevin Danso) – the most outfielders to have not missed a single minute for any team in the competition in 2023-24. Gradit won more aerial duels than any other defender through the first four matchdays (18). Among players to contest 20+ aerial duels, he also had the best success rate, winning 78% (18/23). David Raya may come back in for the hosts after missing the win at his parent club Brentford, though Aaron Ramsdale will be hopeful of keeping his place in goal after leaving the Gtech Community Stadium with a clean sheet. Thomas Partey (thigh), Jurrien Timber (knee) and Emile Smith Rowe (knee) remain sidelined, while Fabio Vieira underwent surgery on a groin injury this week and will be out for a while. Speaking of suspensions, Lens midfielder Morgan Guilavogui will miss the trip to north London after his red card against PSV on MD 4, but defender Danso is expected to be fit following a foot injury. Franck Haise’s side beat Arsenal 2-1 in the reverse fixture on MD 2, with Adrien Thomasson and Elye Wahi turning things around after Gabriel Jesus’ opener for the visitors. Lens are unbeaten in their three previous Champions League meetings with Arsenal, managing a 1-1 home draw and a 1-0 away win when they were paired together in 1998-99. Neither team qualified for the knockout stages that season. They also met in the semi-finals of the since-rebranded UEFA Cup in 1999-00. Arsenal won 3-1 on aggregate, though suffered a penalty shoot-out loss against Galatasaray in the final. All five of Lens’ previous European matches against English teams have come against Arsenal (W2 D1 L2). Arsenal went top of the Premier League after their 1-0 win at Brentford on Saturday and come into this having won their last three in all competitions, following back-to-back defeats at West Ham (EFL Cup) and Newcastle United (Premier League). They are on nine points in Group B in the Champions League, four points ahead of PSV and Lens having beaten the Eredivisie side on MD 1 and taken three points against Sevilla both home and away. As mentioned, Lens did not start the season well. Losing key players Seko Fofana and Loïs Openda in the summer seemed to affect them, but since defeat at Metz in September, they are unbeaten in eight Ligue 1 games (W5 D3). It was a positive return from the international break as they beat Clermont Foot 3-0 on Saturday. Lens haven’t conceded more than once in any of their last 13 games in all competitions, but their win over Arsenal on MD 2 remains their only victory so far in the Champions League this season. They drew away to Sevilla and at home to PSV, before losing 1-0 in Eindhoven last time out, their only defeat in their last 12 games in all competitions. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off on Wednesday, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Arsenal are heavy favourites to get the job done at Emirates Stadium, with the Opta supercomputer giving them a 72.5% likelihood of victory. Lens are rated at just 10.6% to complete a double over the English side, while a draw – which would still see Arsenal through – is at 16.9%. In our overall Group B predictions, Arsenal have an almost certain 98.9% chance of going through, and a strong 93.8% chance of winning the group and being seeded in the draw for the last 16. The Gunners haven’t reached a Champions League final since 2006, but did so in 16.1% of the Opta supercomputer’s 10,000 simulations, winning the trophy 7.2% of the time. Things are still far more up in the air in the group for Lens. They are handed a 33.2% chance of advancing from Group B, and not given much of a chance of making it beyond that. They reached the quarter-finals in just 8.5% of simulations, and the semi-finals only 2.1% of the time. Arsenal: Aaron Ramsdale, David Raya, James Hillson, William Saliba, Ben White, Gabriel Magalhães, Jakub Kiwior, Cédric Soares, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Lino Sousa, Thomas Partey, Martin Ødegaard, Leandro Trossard, Jorginho, Fábio Vieira, Mohamed Elneny, Kai Havertz, Declan Rice, Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus, Emile Smith Rowe, Gabriel Martinelli, Eddie Nketiah, Reiss Nelson. Head Coach: Mikel Arteta Lens: Jean-Louis Leca, Brice Samba, Roman Karolewicz, Yannick Pandor, Ruben Aguilar, Deiver Machado, Kevin Danso, Facundo Medina, Faitout Maouassa, Massadio Haïdara, Jonathan Gradit, Abdukodir Khusanov, Przemysław Frankowski, Ismaëlo Ganiou, Kenny M’Bala, Wesley Gbalou Zahibo, Souleymane Sagnan, Oscar Lenne, Ryan George, Kaïs Benabdelouahed, Mattéo Escouflaire, Marceau Apperry, Salis Abdul Samed, David Costa, Andy Diouf, Neil El Aynaoui, Nampalys Mendy, Adrien Thomasson, Fode Sylla, Anthony Bermot, Tom Pouilly, Mathéssendé Baud-Banaga, Florian Dewaele, Grégoire Herbin, Florian Sotoca, Elye Wahi, Angelo Fulgini, Wesley Said, Morgan Guilavogui, Ayanda Sishuba, Nolan Bonté, Sean Tormin.

6376,Man Utd sign goalkeeper Dubravka on loan from Newcastle as De Gea backup,"WHAT HAPPENED? Dubravka completed his move on Thursday ahead of Manchester United match against Leicester City in what is expected to be the last piece of incoming business for the Red Devils this summer. He carries a reported £2 million loan fee with a £6m obligation to buy if he plays a certain number of matches. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Manchester United had been in the market to sign a new shot-stopper after allowing Dean Henderson to join Nottingham Forest on loan for the duration of the 2022-23 campaign. That left them with only 36-year-old Tom Heaton available as backup for first-choice David de Gea. IN THREE PHOTOS:  WHAT NEXT FOR MANCHESTER UNITED? Erik ten Hag and Dubravka will be hoping the 33-year-old will be ready to slot into the squad soon, though with De Gea in control of the starting role, Dubravka may not see the pitch much this year.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-sign-goalkeeper-dubravka-on-loan-newcastle-de-gea/blt0b9d8817e11ac462,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10862,Real Madrid Squad Audit: A Summer of Transition or One Last Hurrah?,"There’s a transitional feel to Real Madrid’s squad building this summer. The entire club is in limbo. In fact, the entire landscape of European football could look very different if Florentino Pérez finally gets his man this summer after a failed raid for Kylian Mbappé last year. The 24-year-old has a year left on his contract and PSG president, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, says it is impossible that the best player in the world leaves the club for free. That sounds like an invitation for an offer if Pérez ever heard one. But it also sounds like PSG and Mbappé have painted themselves into a corner. Can Pérez be tempted to make a bid? For now, we don’t know the answer to that. All we have is a stand-off and a transfer story that has turned into a saga. Regardless, the Real Madrid machine doesn’t stop. Even if it can sometimes resemble a clown car that somehow manages to keep chugging along despite losing parts as it moves. The whole world watches in a bemused state of awe as to how it keeps going. They routinely win the biggest competition in Europe without having the best team (or squad) in Europe. Real Madrid will be expected to win every competition they enter next season with or without Mbappé. They are one of the few teams in the world where that is a realistic annual objective. A long-term solution to the Mbappé saga will inform them of what era they are in and how realistic a trophy-laden season is next year. Are they at the doorstep of a hope-filled new dawn or will they try to squeeze a few more drops out of the orange? Maybe they’ll eventually sign Mbappé, or he’ll renew at PSG or perhaps another team might gazump them. Until it is resolved, the spectre of Mbappé haunts the Bernabéu. So, how do Real Madrid say it’s a rebuilding year without explicitly saying it’s a rebuilding year? You can sign Joselu to replace Karim Benzema for a start. You can cling on to Carlo Ancelotti, who has a verbal agreement to join Brazil next summer, like a couple who don’t want to be together but neither knows how to end it. Are they happy together? Well, they’re not sufficiently unhappy enough to make a change just yet. How does their squad look going into a year filled with intrigue and unanswered questions? Thibaut Courtois recently made headlines for walking out on Belgium after a fall-out with the new manager Domenico Tedesco. Some of his own international teammates even criticised him for leaving the squad during international duty. There has never been any doubts about his status at Real Madrid. He is the certified number one and Andriy Lunin will have to suffice with playing back-up to his teammate for now. Lunin played in 12 games in all competitions last season, clocking up just north of 1,000 minutes. He’s 24 and might turn into a fine goalkeeper one day but he won’t be doing that at Real Madrid while he shares a dressing room with Courtois. The Belgian remains the premium shot-stopper in Europe and prevented 5.4 goals last season in the league and Champions League. He couldn’t keep Erling Haaland and Manchester City out in the Champions League despite his best efforts but Real Madrid have one of the very best goalkeepers in the world under contract until 2026. Real Madrid’s defence is in a solid if unspectacular state. They have lots of options in central defence with Éder Militão, Antonio Rüdiger and David Alaba all capable of anchoring a backline if needed. Cult hero, Nacho, has re-signed for another year and remains a one-club man along with being a versatile option across Ancelotti’s back line. He can essentially play anywhere in defence although at 33, Madrid would prefer if they didn’t need him to. He will be plugged in where necessary and his experience, availability and versatility means Real Madrid will never find themselves in a hopeless situation as long as Nacho can be called to the rescue. At full-back, things get a little murkier. Ancelotti has options on the left with Fran García arriving from Rayo Vallecano after a scintillating campaign in Vallecas. Ferland Mendy has a contract until 2025 but has struggled to take advantage of opportunities. The French defender could be third choice next season. Eduardo Camavinga is also an option. In fact, he played in more games than any Real Madrid player last season and most of them were at left-back. 59 – Eduardo @Camavinga 🇫🇷 has made 59 apperances for @realmadriden in 2022/23 in all competitions, more than any LaLiga player in the season and the most by a Real Madrid player in a single campaign. Youth. pic.twitter.com/hsxJJdJyQD Madrid have several left-backs capable of winning the starting job, which is another way of saying they don’t have a starting left-back that convinces them. García should get the lion’s share of minutes in the position to start the season but maybe Camavinga went from ‘filling in’ at left-back to being an important part of Ancelotti’s tactics last season. Competition in Madrid’s midfield is fierce and Camavinga at left-back is a neat way of fitting another midfielder into the team. He provides solid defensive cover for Vinícius Jr., who is not known for his desire to defend. There are no doubts over the danger García provides as an overlapping full-back but if he stumbles going the other way, expect Camavinga to be jettisoned in before long. Right-back is an area Pérez has to target this summer. The current starter is Dani Carvajal, who can still be excellent at times and in big moments, but less so across an entire season. He is 31 and has been prone to injury for a number of years, although he was relatively injury-free last year. Carvajal’s back-ups are Lucas Vázquez, a right-back who isn’t a right-back and then Nacho. They are one injury away from being thrown into mini-crisis in that position. Álvaro Odriozola is another squad player but barring something drastic happening, he is not seen as an option under Ancelotti. Meanwhile, Madrid have collected potentially the greatest arsenal of midfielders we have ever seen. As you make your way down their list of midfielders, you’re excused for spontaneous cooing. In fact, it’s expected: Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, Aurélien Tchouaméni, Eduardo Camavinga, Jude Bellingham, Dani Ceballos, Fede Valverde, Brahim Díaz. It has taken some time but Pérez has finally exacted revenge on all those who criticised him for selling Claude Makélélé. “Why put another layer of gold paint on the Bentley when you are losing the entire engine?” is a quote credited to Zinedine Zidane but captures the sentiment of many who were baffled by that decision two decades ago. They have youth, experience, technical excellence, pace and power in their midfield. The only real problem they have now is squeezing them into the starting XI and making sure everyone is happy. It’s Ancelotti’s job to make sure the group is functional rather than an expensive and very talented assortment of tchotchkes collected by Pérez. We have come to expect excellence from Real Madrid’s midfielders. The new signings will just be a continuation of that. You can count on one hand the number of Champions League nights when people weren’t waxing lyrical, almost nostalgic, about how good Luka Modric and Toni Kroos were and to some extent still are. Madrid’s midfield is still a portal to the same excellence we have seen for the last decade. That is, of course, unless Carlo is planning something new. A box midfield? A diamond? Three at the back? What might he have up his sleeve as his swan song?  If Real Madrid’s squad does look like a clown car, the engine at least is in perfect nick and it will not fail. Ancelotti will likely have to borrow from the embarrassment of riches in midfield to balance a defence and attack that doesn’t quite make sense. Help is needed elsewhere. The ‘elsewhere’ that needs most help is their attack. The summer Cristiano Ronaldo left Real Madrid, Julen Lopetegui bemoaned that they had taken 50 goals away from the team. Lopetegui insisted that the sword of Damacles would not fall on any one person to fill that void. As it turned out, Karim Benzema came quite close to doing it on his own. He scored 44 two seasons ago on his way an unlikely Ballon d’Or and while he slowed down this season with only 31 goals in 43 games, he was still the focal point around which Madrid’s attack orbited. Joselu has been brought in to hold down the fort. He’s not Mbappé but he knows he’s not Mbappé. The 33-year-old arrives on a one-year deal from relegated Espanyol after he scored 16 goals last season. After unsuccessful spells at Newcastle and Stoke City, he could be ready to start the season as Madrid’s number nine. A lot of his work will be facilitating the Brazilian duo either side of him. Vinícius remains a one-man shot-creating machine and doesn’t necessarily need much help but an overlapping Fran García and a bruiser like Joselu might. There are some games and situations where García, the speedy left-back, will come in handy but this might look more like a team undergoing some kind of positional revolution this season. If you add Camavinga into the defence and Valverde into the attack, you can play five of your eight midfielders with plenty of talent on the bench left to influence games as substitutes. And you cover the glaring issue at number nine. Vinícius played 4,755 minutes last season. Only David de Gea and Bruno Fernandes played more among Europe’s top five leagues in all competitions. He turns 23 this month and can handle the workload – in fact he enjoys it – but those numbers are not sustainable. The problem is that he doesn’t have a replacement in the squad and he will be needed even more next season in the absence of Benzema. Rodrygo had a quietly brilliant season. He underachieved his expected goals but his movement in the box, the nuances he adds on the right with his dribbling and close control is something that can improve everyone around him. He’s just 22 and is still improving so if he can sustain his peaks from last season for longer, it will help Madrid’s overall efficiency in attack. Maybe Brahim Díaz can chip in if he ends up staying but for now, it looks like Madrid are content with waiting for things to shake out in the market before anyone else arrives or leaves. -4.4 – Top 3 players with the worst goal difference between goals scored and expected goals in LaLiga 2022/23:-4.4 – RODRYGO GOES 🇧🇷 (9 goals and 13.4 xG).-4 – Yeremi Pino 🇪🇸 (4 goals and 8 xG)-3,4 – Hugo Duro 🇪🇸 (1 goal and 4,4 xG)Surprising. pic.twitter.com/8xJeK9SLDE Five of the stalwarts of the last decade, Kroos, Modric, Carvajal, Nacho and Vázquez all have expiring contracts next season and they’re all at varying stages of their 30s. Madrid are transitioning into a new era and it’s natural that they are afraid to let go just yet of what has been described as their Golden Era. They have plenty of young talent in their squad to usher in a new dawn but development is never linear. Madrid have a talented squad, overflowing with potential but they have some deficiencies too. At the same time, if they do manage to bring Mbappé to the Bernabéu a year ahead of schedule, all of those deficiencies would be forgotten.

7311,Afcon 2021 winner Mendy receives hero's welcome from Chelsea squad,"Edouard Mendy received a warm welcome from his Chelsea teammates after winning the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal. During the penalty shootout against Egypt at the Olembe Stadium in Yaounde, the goalkeeper saved Mohanad Lasheen’s kick as the Lions of Teranga went on to triumph 4-2. And Mendy was enthusiastically received by his Blues team-mates on Wednesday as Chelsea prepare for their Fifa Club World Cup fixture on Wednesday evening. The former Rennes man was applauded by the squad and staff, who formed a guard of honour, as he arrived at the team’s camp in Abu Dhabi. The Stamford Bridge giants square up against Saudi Arabia side Al Hilal in the semi-final billed for the Mohammed bin Zayed Stadium before either playing a final or third-place play-off three days later. Meanwhile, Chelsea coach Zsolt Low stated that it won’t be easy for the African goalkeeper to displace Kepa Arrizabalaga currently. “We have to check him, we have to talk to him. We will see in a few days whether there is a possibility he plays,” Low told the media per Chelsea website. “This is a good situation for the coaches where we have two amazing goalkeepers. Mendy did a fantastic performance, he won the Africa Cup, and was the best goalkeeper at the tournament. “Kepa has done an amazing job and in the last game saved a very important penalty. He is also in very good shape. “For sure when Mendy arrives we will have talks, also with the goalkeeper coaches, and we will take a decision afterwards.” When asked about the incredible scenes in Dakar as Senegal revelled in their maiden Afcon triumph, Low added: “We were very happy for Mendy. This is a very important thing for him and for all African players, to win the Africa Cup. “He did an amazing performance. It was very important to celebrate with his teammates, and with his country. It was a nice celebration!” Mendy was lured from Ligue 1 outfit Rennes in a £22m ($31m) deal as the six-time English top-flight kings sought to find greater stability between the sticks as costly errors had crept into Kepa game. Appreciatively, he has since proven to be one of the bargain signings, helping the London side emerge as European champions. ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/afcon-2021-winner-mendy-receives-hero-chelsea-squad/blt6e3a73ded1cb4098,Shina Oludare - @sportingshina,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7723,Matteo Moretto Transfer Column: Nico Williams still attracting interest,"Matteo Moretto gives Football EspaÃ±a exclusive information on the latest deals dominating the papers in Spain, as revealed in the Daily Briefing.  Spain star Nico Williams is very grateful to Athletic Club and is very happy with his career there. In the summer there will undoubtedly be clubs that will ask for information, and possibly try to make a move for him, because Nico is one of the best talents in his position. Before Arsenal and Chelsea, Real Madrid and Barcelona were also linked, but before he signed his new deal, and itâs too early to talk about any club in particular. Make no mistake though, he is a very popular player for clubs from the Premier League, La Liga and Italy. Real Madrid are obviously trying to make a move for Bayern Munichâs Alphonso Davies, and previously we discussed that Miguel Gutierrez could be an alternative to the Canadian if they cannot extract him from Bavaria. Regarding the futures of Fran Garcia and Ferland Mendy, the two left-backs currently available, itâs still a developing situation. Itâs true that Mendy is well thought of in Saudi Arabia, hence the links, but they sounded him out in the summer, so itâs no sure thing they will come back in for him. Despite struggling against Real Madrid, Yan Couto has been excellent this season, and that explains the previous links to Los Blancos, although I canât speak to them yet. Equally, there are several European clubs that are following Couto, and Manchester City could give the go-ahead for his departure in the summer. Couto is due to return to City from his loan at Girona this summer, and only has a year remaining on his deal, but as of now, nobody has opened talks for Couto.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Matteo-Moretto-Transfer-Column-Nico-Williams-still-attracting-interest/3300776,,12-Feb,all-football-app
7184,"Tau is special, needed more time and opportunities at Brighton & Hove Albion - Furman","Former South Africa captain Dean Furman believes Percy Tau did not get enough chances to prove his worth for Premier League side Brighton & Hove Albion. The 27-year-old striker was signed by the Seagulls Albion in 2018 but was loaned to Belgium where he played for Union SG, Club Brugge, and Anderlecht. He ended up making just three appearances for the English side, in the Premier League and provided an assist. Al Ahly came calling in 2021 and the Bafana Bafana star did not hesitate to make the move. ""I would have loved Percy to be given more opportunities; I was excited to watch him in the Champions League and the Premier League where he got a few games. It is a tough league to acclimatise,"" Furman told Football and Friends. ""He needed more time and opportunities that really did not come his way and he made a decision that he felt was right for his career. We can say we wanted to see him stay in Europe turning out for this or that club. ""I can see the obvious link going to Egypt, a former manager, a massive club playing top end of African football. That is not to discredit where he is because [Al Ahly] is a massive, massive football club but I would have loved to see him getting more opportunities at Brighton because I know how special he is... it is a shame it did not work out for him."" Tau has been in and out of the Al Ahly squad owing to injuries but has been effective when on the pitch.  His latest involvement for the reigning Caf Champions League kings was against Sudanese top-tier side Al Merrikh whereby the Red Devils won 3-1.  In the Champions League match played on March 18, Tau scored the first goal after just 19 minutes before the hosts equalised through Ramadan Agab to see the teams go into the break even. Tau did not return for the second half after getting injured, but it mattered less for the Egyptians who went on to score two more goals courtesy of Mohamed Sherif and Ahmed Radwan.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tau-is-special-needed-more-time-and-opportunities-at/blt25626c36bda09e28,Seth Willis,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Whether you're battling it out to win your mini-league or attempting to avoid the embarrassment of finishing bottom, GOAL's guide aims to give you all the team news and tips you need ahead of the final day. Date Fixture Time (BST) May 22 Arsenal vs Everton 4pm May 22 Brentford vs Leeds 4pm May 22 Brighton vs West Ham 4pm May 22 Burnley vs Newcastle 4pm May 22 Chelsea vs Watford 4pm May 22 Crystal Palace vs Man Utd 4pm May 22 Leicester vs Southampton 4pm May 22 Liverpool vs Wolves 4pm May 22 Man City vs Aston Villa 4pm May 22 Norwich vs Tottenham 4pm Jurgen Klopp has confirmed that while no risks will be taken with Mohamed Salah (£13.1m), his preference would be for the Egyptian, who missed Liverpool's 2-1 win over Southampton after suffering a knock in the FA Cup final, to play against Wolves. Manchester City, who will be guaranteed the title if they beat Wolves, could welcome back both Kyle Walker (£5.4m) and John Stones (£5.2m) after both returned to training on May 19, although Ruben Dias (£6.2m) is expected to miss out once again. Ralf Rangnick hasn't given any clues as to his final Manchester United line-up, however, with the Red Devils' interim boss insisting that decisions will be made after Saturday's training session. There has been a fitness concern over Harry Kane (£12.5m), meanwhile, with the Tottenham striker having pulled out of a media event due to feeling unwell but Antonio Conte has said that he expects him to be available for the meeting with Norwich. Rob Holding (£4.1m) has served his one-match ban and is available again for Arsenal, while Mason Mount (£7.7m) and Kai Havertz (£7.9m) should both come back into Chelsea's starting XI after being left on the bench for the 1-1 draw with Leicester City. Return to top Player Return date Rob Holding (Arsenal) May 22 (vs Everton) Jarrad Branthwaite (Everton) May 22 (vs Arsenal) Dan James (Leeds) End of season Luke Ayling (Leeds) End of season Matt Lowton (Burnley) End of season Salomon Rondon (Everton) End of season Return to top The battle for the Premier League's Golden Boot is one of the subplots to look out for on the final day, with Salah (£13.1m) currently out in front by just a single goal. Despite Jurgen Klopp warning that he may only make the bench, expect the Liverpool star to feature from the start against Wolves as he looks to potentially fire the Reds to title glory. If the mere mention of ""bench"" is enough to put you off selecting Salah, then Heung-Min Son (£11.2m), who is one behind the Egyptian in the top scorer race, is your man, with Tottenham taking on bottom of the table Norwich. Available at just £4.3m, Sessegnon is an absolute bargain and is almost certain to keep his place in the Spurs starting XI for their trip to Norwich, with Sergio Reguilon, having been out for so long, unlikely to come straight back in despite having returned to training. While Liverpool have a Champions League final meeting with Real Madrid to think about, you can be certain that all their focus will be on beating Wolves and making sure they get the job done, in case Manchester City do what is unlikely and slip up at Aston Villa For that reason, Mane should be a nailed on starter at Anfield, looking to add to the 174 points he's earned so far. Pep Guardiola is likely to make changes to his starting XI after the 2-2 draw with West Ham and, having not featured against the Hammers, Foden is likely to come back in as City look to secure the title against Aston Villa. Owned by just 7.4% of FPL bosses at the time of writing, the England international rarely misses City's biggest games of the season - this clearly being one of them - so expect him to start on Sunday.

1673,'Real Madrid dream never over' - Mbappe leaves door open for future transfer after signing PSG contract extension,"Kylian Mbappe has said that he could still one day move to Real Madrid despite snubbing them to sign a contract extension with Paris Saint-Germain over the weekend. His PSG renewal infuriated people in Spain, but he has nonetheless expressed hope that hard feelings will fade away over time. The 23-year-old's new deal with the French club will run until 2025. ""Never over, never over,"" Mbappe told BBC when asked whether his dream of playing for the Blancos had died. ""The only thing is that now I have signed a contract for three years more. ""You never know what can happen in the future. ""I give up to think about the future, I only think about the present and the present is I signed a new contract for three years more at Paris Saint-Germain."" On his decision not to join Real Madrid this year, he added: ""I spoke to the president of Real Madrid because I have a lot of respect for him and the club. I think it was important to say it personally that I wasn't going to go. ""To be a great player [you have] to be honest and everything was great and good because we have a good relationship."" Mbappe will still be in the prime of his career at 26 years old when his PSG extension runs out, so he will likely be an in-demand player in 2025. Real Madrid will have almost certainly made big-money signings in the interim, though, and it remains to be seen whether they will hold a grudge against the French star.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/real-madrid-dream-never-over-mbappe-leaves-door-open-for/blt2c0f7a32975ebb0f,Dan Bernstein,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1504,Next Man Utd manager: Rangnick names Ajax boss Ten Hag one of the best coaches in Europe,"Ralf Rangnick has named Ajax boss Erik ten Hag as one of the best coaches in Europe amid Manchester United's search for a new permanent manager. United drafted in Rangnick on an interim basis after deciding to sack Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following the team's poor start to the 2021-22 campaign. Rangnick has since managed to steady the ship, reigniting the Red Devils' hopes of a top-four Premier League finish, but will be moving into an advisory role at the end of the season. A permanent replacement for Solskjaer is still being sought, and Ten Hag has been reported as one of the leading candidates for the role. Rangnick is not aware of any discussions with the Dutchman taking place, but ranks him among the elite coaches in the business. ""I don't know him to start with as a person, but I've seen how Ajax have developed since he's been there,"" the United chief has told Sky Sports. ""I know about the work he did while he was at Bayern Munich and it's obvious he's one of the top coaches in Europe but there are a few others. ""We've not spoken about any new manager so far and therefore we've not spoken about him."" Rangnick was speaking ahead of the Red Devils' crucial derby clash with Manchester City on Sunday, and went on to reveal that he already has a preferred option in mind to fill his spot in the dugout. ""So far, we've not spoken about that,"" he said. ""Not with [football director] John Murtough or anyone else, we've not spoken about this topic over the last weeks and months since I've been here. I know my opinion but so far we've not spoken about that so it's all I can tell you."" Ten Hag began his coaching career with the Go Ahead Eagles in 2012, where he spent one year before taking over Bayern Munich II. The 52-year-old moved to Twente after leaving Germany and guided the club to a fourth-placed Eredivisie finish in 2016-17, attracting attention from Ajax in the process. Ten Hag was handed an initial two-and-a-half-year contract at Johan Cruyff Arena, and has seen that agreement extended after delivering four domestic trophies, including two Eredivisie titles. Ajax are on course to retain the trophy this season and still going strong in the Champions League, but Ten Hag has entered the last 18 months of his contract and United could yet come calling in the summer.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/next-man-utd-manager-rangnick-ajax-ten-hag-best-coaches/blt7fb27de0f8ad3c94,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10243,Arsenal vs West Ham: Prediction and Preview,"Arsenal look to regain their spot at the top of the Premier League as they welcome West Ham to the Emirates Stadium on Thursday. We look ahead to the game with our Arsenal vs West Ham prediction and preview. Arsenal were top of the Premier League at Christmas, and will need to beat West Ham United on Thursday to ensure they also lead the way at the turn of the year. Liverpool’s 2-0 victory at Burnley saw Jürgen Klopp’s men jump into first place on Boxing Day, though Arsenal were boosted in the title race by Manchester United’s dramatic 3-2 comeback win against Aston Villa later the same day. The Gunners will fancy their chances against West Ham. Arsenal are unbeaten in their last 12 home London derbies in the Premier League (W8 D4) since a 2-0 loss to Chelsea in August 2021. They have kept just one clean sheet in that time, though that did come against West Ham (2-0 in December 2021). West Ham do not tend to end the year well, having only won their final league game once in the last seven calendar years (D2 L4) – a 4-1 victory at Watford in 2021. They have also lost the last four times they have finished the year with a London derby, since beating Charlton Athletic 5-0 in 2000. Hammers boss David Moyes has a poor record away to Arsenal, having never won in 22 attempts in all competitions (D4 L18). The Scot has only faced Chelsea on the road more without ever winning in his managerial career (23). Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka continues to look comfortable playing at the Emirates Stadium. He has been involved in 18 goals in his last 17 home games in all competitions, scoring 11 and assisting seven. Saka has also had a hand in three goals in his last four league games against West Ham (one goal, two assists), though the England man did miss a penalty against the Hammers at the London Stadium last season. In-form Jarrod Bowen, on the other hand, has flourished on his travels. He has scored seven away goals for West Ham in the Premier League this season. Mike Small in 1991-92 (nine) was the last player to score more on the road in a top-flight campaign for the club. As for team news, Arsenal will be without Kai Havertz after the Germany international was shown his fifth yellow card of the season in the 1-1 draw at Liverpool, while Takehiro Tomiyasu, Fabio Vieira, Thomas Partey and Jurrien Timber remain unavailable through injury. The availability of Nayef Aguerd will be touch and go after the defender missed West Ham’s 2-0 win over Manchester United through illness, with Michail Antonio likely to be the only other absentee. Arsenal have a very strong home record against West Ham, winning 12 of their last 13 Premier League home games against them, with the exception being a 2-0 loss on the opening weekend of the 2015-16 season. West Ham beat Arsenal three times in a row between February 2006 and April 2007, but in the 30 meetings since they have won just two (D6 L22). Against no side have West Ham lost more Premier League games than they have against Arsenal (35, same as against Liverpool), while Arsenal only have more wins in the competition against Everton (37). Arsenal won this fixture 3-1 on Boxing Day last year, though had to come from behind to do so. They then played out a 2-2 draw at London Stadium in April as the Gunners’ Premier League title challenge against Man City faltered. West Ham did win their last encounter, though, beating Arsenal 3-1 in the EFL Cup fourth round last month as star midfielder Declan Rice played against his former side for the first time. Arsenal are unbeaten in their last 13 home games in all competitions (W11 D2) since a 3-0 loss to Brighton in May. The Gunners have won their last seven at the Emirates Stadium by an aggregate score of 21-2. Mikel Arteta’s side have won just one of their last four games in all competitions (D2 L1), though that did include a 1-1 draw away to PSV in their final Champions League group game, which was essentially a dead rubber for them as they had already secured top spot in their group. The Gunners were very impressive in their recent 2-0 home win against Brighton, while they claimed a good point at Liverpool last time out, with Gabriel’s early header cancelled out by a Mohamed Salah strike. West Ham have won four of their nine Premier League away games this season (D1 L4), already more than they won on the road in the whole of last season (W3 D3 L13). However, the Hammers are without a clean sheet in their last 13 away from home in the league, shipping 31 goals in the process. The Hammers have won four of their last six games in all competitions, though did concede five goals in the each of their two defeats in that run (5-0 v Fulham in the Premier League, 5-1 v Liverpool in the EFL Cup). Their last two league wins saw them beat Wolves and Man Utd at home, but West Ham’s most recent away win did come in north London, beating Tottenham 2-1 earlier this month. Their other win in that run came against Freiburg in the Europa League. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off in this game, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta Player Ratings are something we introduced ahead of 2023-24. For a quick primer on how they’re calculated, you can check our explainer here. Before kick-off in this match, here are the top five performing players from both teams in the 2023-24 Premier League according to the Opta Player Ratings: Declan Rice: 80.6 (out of 100) Oleksandr Zinchenko: 80.5 Martin Ødegaard: 78.1Ben White: 74.6William Saliba: 73.0 Mohammed Kudus: 79.9Jarrod Bowen: 79.3James Ward-Prowse: 75.3Emerson: 69.6Kurt Zouma: 66.6 The Opta supercomputer is backing Arsenal’s strong home record against West Ham. Arteta’s side won 57.1% of the 10,000 simulations carried out by the supercomputer before kick-off. Never rule the Hammers out, though, as they took all three points away from the Emirates 18.5% of the time, while a draw occurred on 24.4% of occasions. Arsenal remain second favourites to win the title behind defending champions Manchester City. Heading into this one, the Gunners are judged to have a 27.3% chance of securing their first league title since 2003-04. West Ham have had a bit of a mixed campaign so far, but the supercomputer believes they can finish strongly. Their likeliest finish in the league table as things stand is sixth, which would secure European football again. Enjoy this?

2971,Arsenal eye Leeds star Raphinha as possible Pepe replacement,"Arsenal are interested in Leeds attacker Raphinha, GOAL understands. The Gunners are looking to bolster their attack this summer, with Mikel Arteta keen to add more goals to his side. Manchester City frontman Gabriel Jesus is the priority for the central striking role, but his Brazilian international team-mate Raphinha is also a player who the Gunners are keeping tabs on. Arsenal have not tabled an offer for the Raphinha and have yet to hold any official talks with Leeds over the 25-year-old. But GOAL can confirm that the attacker, who scored 11 Premier League goals last season, is on their list of targets this summer, as first reported by The Telegraph. Barcelona are also believed to be keen on Raphinha, who has two years left on his contract at Elland Road. Raphinha mainly operates on the right hand side of the attack for Leeds, the position Bukayo Saka currently occupies for Arsenal. Should the Gunners firm up their interest and go on to sign Raphinha, he would not replace Saka, who has just been named Arsenal's player of the season for the second successive season. He would more than likely come in and add to the competition at Emirates Stadium, with Arteta keen to strengthen his squad to ensure it can cope with the extra demands of European football during the coming 2022/23 campaign. It’s expected that club record signing Nicolas Pepe will leave Arsenal this summer. Raphinha is currently away on international duty with Brazil, but has claimed that his future at club level is now out of his hands. Asked about his future earlier this week, the winger told reporters: ""The next game, against Japan. ""Then I go on vacation. I have a contract with Leeds until 2024, my future is in the hands of Deco (his agent) and Leeds, I have my mind on the national team, on the game and also on my vacation - we need a vacation. ""I have a contract with Leeds and this issue is resolved by my manager. When something is right, he sends [it to] me.""

11699,Jamie Vardy’s Having a Party: The Goalscoring 30s,"Jamie Vardy scored his 128th Premier League goal for Leicester City in their 2-0 away win at Burnley last night. In doing so, he broke one of the Premier League’s more obscure records, becoming the highest scoring player in the competition after turning 30 years old. 94 of his 128 goals have come since his 30th birthday on 11th January 2017 (73%), with his strike last night sending him past the previous record holder Ian Wright (93). Like Wright, Vardy made his Premier League debut late on in his career – Vardy was 27 years & 232 days old on his top-flight debut in August 2014, while Wright made his Premier League debut aged 28 years & 286 days old. However, unlike Vardy, Wright had already been playing top-flight English league football for three seasons prior to the Premier League beginning in 1992, scoring 52 goals in 102 First Division appearances across spells at Crystal Palace and Arsenal. Much has already been said of Vardy’s astonishing rise through the English league pyramid, with the striker playing in the seventh tier just 11 seasons ago. There were only eight years separating Vardy becoming top scorer in the Conference – now National League – and winning the Premier League Golden Boot in 2019-20. All but three of his 128 Premier League goals have come inside the box, with Vardy the archetypal and also literal fox-in-the-box. 99 of these have come from open play, with his next target becoming just one of 18 players to have a century of Premier League goals from inside the box in open play. He’s already one of the 32 players in the Premier League ‘100 Club’ with his 128 goals, but of those players only eight have a better minutes per goal record in the competition than Vardy’s average of 167.  Vardy’s Premier League career has coincided with the ‘Big Six’ era, with his Leicester side in 2015-16 being a rare example of one of the non-Big Six clubs besting their illustrious rivals. Since his Premier League debut in August 2014, Vardy has scored 43 goals in 84 games against Arsenal, Spurs, Liverpool, Chelsea, Man Utd and Man City combined. His average of a goal every 160 minutes in these matches is, remarkably, better than his average against teams outside the ‘big six’ in the competition (170 mins per goal). The ultimate big game player? Tony Cottee and Jamie Vardy are the only players to score PL goals on both Halloween and Valentine’s Day #ghoulsgirlsgoals It’s fairly commonly known that Vardy’s one of those players who doesn’t get involved too much during games – he’s a striker that comes alive in the box. On average he only has 28 touches per 90 – of players with 1000+ minutes since his Premier League debut in August 2014, only Jermain Defoe (25) and Teemu Pukki (26) average fewer per 90 minutes in the competition. None of this really matters when Vardy’s role is to be the man to finish off the move, something he’s proved that he’s more than capable of. How far can Vardy rise up the all-time Premier League goal rankings? Who knows? Now 35 years old, age hasn’t affected his game up to now and it looks like there are more seasons, and goals, left in those legs yet.

5843,"Inter vs AC Milan: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Saturday evening sees two of Europe's oldest rivals meet once more in Serie A as Inter host AC Milan in the Derby della Madonnina. The Nerazzurri are currently top of the table, four points ahead of their city rivals, with Inter mounting an impressive defence of the Scudetto. Milan, meanwhile, have won just five of their last 12 league matches but put in a competitive performance in the last derby meeting in November which ended in a 1-1 draw. Inter are unbeaten in Serie A since October 16, winning 11 and drawing three of their last 14 games. One of those draws came against Milan two months ago and another stalemate can be backed at 11/4 (3.75) with bet365. Simone Inzaghi's men are priced at 4/5 (1.80) to claim three points, while the Rossoneri are available at 10/3 (4.33). Edin Dzeko, Lautaro Martinez and Zlatan Ibrahimovic are all priced at 9/2 (5.50) to open the scoring. Meanwhile, Felipe Caicedo and Olivier Giroud are both offered at 5/1 (6.00) ahead of Alexis Sanchez who can be backed at 13/2 (7.50). In the previous meeting between the sides it was Hakan Calhanoglu who scored first and the Turkey international is on offer at 7/1 (8.00) to break the deadlock once more. There is little doubt that Simone Inzaghi's side are clear favourites to retain their league title and 2021 saw them end the year in stunning defensive fashion with six consecutive clean sheets. The side have conceded in two of their three league matches in 2022 but nevertheless remain a daunting prospect for any team in the Italian top flight. Over the last 12 months Inter have scored in every league match they have contested except one, and they will be confident of continuing that scoring run this weekend. Milan, meanwhile, have also been finding the back of the net with ease, netting in 21 of their 23 Serie A encounters this season and backing goals at both ends looks like an attractive option. Both teams to score is priced at 8/13 (1.62) while backing goals at both ends in the first half is available at 3/1 (4.00) and looks an excellent value option, one which has paid out in two of the last three league derbies.

11791,Tie Fighters,"Chelsea and Liverpool played out a classic on Sunday but by doing so engaged in a Premier League form of mutually assured destruction. After Manchester City very fortunately took three points from their game at Arsenal yesterday, a draw between the two teams theoretically capable of beating them to the title has left Pep Guardiola’s side 10 points clear of Chelsea [game over] and 11 clear of Liverpool, having a played an extra game [game almost certainly over].  Chelsea 2-2 Liverpool: All the action came in the first half, but still a fantastic match at Stamford Bridge. The momentum graphic shows just how end-to-end it was.Chelsea have won 20 points in 11 PL home games this season, three fewer than they've won away (23 in 10 games). pic.twitter.com/a7qlcxdspA The league table rarely lies, and the unvarnished truth it is shouting in our ears this season is that once again, the Guardiola era punishes draws. Manchester City have lost as many Premier League games as Chelsea and Liverpool this season, which means that City’s super-solid lead in the league table is based on winning matches when their rivals draw. The fact that both games between Chelsea and Liverpool this season have been wildly entertaining – yet destructive – draws only helps to make the point. Most people intrinsically know this, but drawing games used to be fine in the context of winning league titles. Who can forget Alex Ferguson glancing some shade on to Arsenal’s Invincibles season by saying that their total of 12 draws all but invalidated the achievement, curiously forgetting that his club’s legendary 1998-99 season saw Manchester United draw 13 times, a total which remains a Premier League record. The last title winners before the Premier League started, Leeds in 1991-92, drew 16 times, which is the joint-most by an English league champion, along with Huddersfield in 1924-25. 16 draws now would absolutely kill a title bid stone cold dead, and, in a sense: rightly so. English football decided its top-flight clubs should have to contest at least 38 games a season back in 1905-06 and for much of the game’s history since then there hasn’t been much variation in the average number of draws per season posted by its league champions. Before the Second World War it was 8.7, from the post-war resumption until the formation of the Premier League it was 9.7 and then in the early years of the reformed top-flight it was 9.6.  The first sign things were changing came with the arrival of Jose Mourinho in 2004. His Chelsea side drew eight games in 2004-05 but that figure fell to four the following season as they retained the title. Manchester United’s three-in-a-row between 2007 and 2009 saw them draw six, five and five games respectively. Shorn of Cristiano Ronaldo, a more prosaic United drew 11 games in 2010-11 on their way to a 19th league championship, and since then the only champions to reach double figures for draws were Leicester with 12, and you can excuse that because it was Leicester. And then we come to Pep Guardiola. Since he joined Manchester City in 2016-17, no Premier League winner has drawn more than five times. Between 2018 and 2020 City (x2) and Liverpool secured the league by winning 32 games in each season, and drawing nine times combined across those three campaigns. That’s as many as Arsenal drew in 2001-02, a season that at the time was seen as incredibly relentless. Back in 2002 not losing games was the holy grail. Arsenal going unbeaten away from home in 2001-02 led a bullish Arsene Wenger to predict his side could go an entire campaign without defeat, something they did indeed do, two years later. But as good as that Arsenal 2003-04 side were at time, in modern terms Ferguson was correct: it was too many draws. One point just isn’t enough, but here’s one point for anyone trying to win the title ahead of Manchester City: win more games. In 2022 draws are just defeats with a better PR agency representing them. Just ask Chelsea and Liverpool.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2022/01/tie-fighters/,Duncan Alexander,02/01/2022 13:29,the-analyst
4239,Ukraine asks FIFA to postpone World Cup play-off against Scotland,"Ukraine have asked FIFA to postpone their March 24 World Cup play-off match against Scotland due to Russia's military invasion of their borders. The winner of the game would play either Wales or Austria for a place at the World Cup. However, the urgent humanitarian crisis unfolding in Ukraine is of far greater priority and concern at this point than a football contest. FIFA wrote in a statement that it would work to ""find an appropriate solution"". ""FIFA expresses its deepest solidarity to everybody affected by what is happening in Ukraine,"" the organisation told BBC. ""A further update will be provided in due course."" Previously, Scotland sent a letter to Ukraine offering their support. ""Football is inconsequential amid conflict,"" said Scottish FA president Rod Petrie. ""But we have conveyed the strong sense of solidarity communicated to us by Scotland fans and citizens in recent days. ""[The SFA] have offered to support our Ukrainian colleagues' preparations as best we can in these unimaginably difficult circumstances."" Russia have been banned indefinitely from international FIFA play as well as UEFA club competitions, and players and coaches have left their domestic league in droves. Additionally, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, who is Russian, has pledged to sell the team under government pressure. Clubs including Schalke and Manchester United have also parted with Russia-based sponsors. Meanwhile, much of the football world has united in solidarity with Ukraine.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ukraine-asks-fifa-to-postpone-world-cup-play-off-against/blte385a32a25793368,Dan Bernstein,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6125,The making of NXGN 2022 winner Jude Bellingham: The 'small and lanky' teenager who became football's best wonderkid,"As Jude Bellingham waited to be spoken to by the British media, pitchside at Signal-Iduna Park on February 17, disappointment was written all over his face. Though the midfielder had both scored and assisted a goal on his side's return to European action following the winter break, an otherwise drab performance had seen them beaten 4-2 at home by Rangers, leaving their hopes of winning the Europa League in tatters. ""We can’t allow those kind of chances,"" Bellingham began to BT Sport, ""but there’s a bit of hope because there’s a second leg, and there’s not one person in that dressing room who will give up, because I won’t let them.” The clip soon went viral, with fans amazed at the apparent leadership that was being shown by an 18-year-old inside the dressing room of one of Europe's elite clubs in a foreign country. The words ""future England captain"" were a recurring theme among Three Lions supporters who posted it to their own social media timelines, and there will have been plenty of current and ex-professionals who would likely echo those thoughts. While Bellingham's drive to win and willingness to not hold back his feelings can get him into bother - either with his own team-mates, as reportedly happened after his foul-mouthed tirade at team-mate Nico Schulz in the return leg at Ibrox, or with the authorities, who fined him €40,000 in December after he questioned the integrity of referee Felix Zwayer given his previous links to match-fixing - they are a sign of a confidence that has been with him since his days as a fresh-faced teenager at Birmingham City. ""When I first saw him live at a Birmingham City Under-23s game, he was still relatively slight and physically average at best,"" Dortmund's chief scout, Marcus Pilawa, told GOAL. ""So he didn't stand out because of his physical abilities, but because he was the captain and already exuded the sense of responsibility on the field that we see here with us now. ""In other words, he took on incredible responsibility, had charisma and personality, was courageous and fulfilled certain leadership criteria. He had a feeling for how the game has to be ordered in central midfield and an incredible work rate."" It is those attributes that laid the foundations for Bellingham to become one of the leading midfield talents in world football, and helped earn him the NXGN 2022 prize as the best male footballer born on or after January 1, 2003. It is likely to be the first of many global honours for Bellingham, who has already broken countless records at both club and international level, and was named Bundesliga Rookie of the Year for the 2020-21 season. The global acclaim that Bellingham is receiving is all a far cry from his early years living in Stourbridge, a town around 15 miles outside of Birmingham city centre. It was there where was spotted by Birmingham City as an U8s player, and where that drive to succeed and better himself was cultivated. Once in the Birmingham academy, he would stay late after training to hone his skills, and asked coaches to play him in different positions during matches so as to improve his all-round game. By the age of 14 he was playing for the club's U18s, while just a month after his 16th birthday he was afforded a first-team debut by manager Pep Clotet, making him the youngest player in Birmingham history. A few weeks later, he added the youngest goalscorer in team history to his CV. ""When he started playing with the senior team, he fitted in because players recognise good players,"" Mike Dodds, the head of the professional development phase programme at Birmingham, told GOAL. ""If you go into a first-team environment and you're a good player, there's a respect there. ""I think once he got the opportunity in the first team, the players thought 'this boy is decent', and that's why he fit in so well. When they saw they could trust him, they forgot about his age. He just becomes another player. ""Once you've got the combination of being a good player and being able to trust them, then age becomes irrelevant. When you put players of that age in that environment, they can surprise you."" 🎙 ""Oh what a moment for Jude Bellingham, in front of the Tilton, 16 years of age.""The time @BellinghamJude became the Club's youngest ever goalscorer is our #MomentOfTheDay. 💪💙 pic.twitter.com/QHihPVmAXy Surprising both his own coaches and opposition managers is exactly what Bellingham set about doing, as he made 44 first-team appearances over the course of the 2019-20 season, scoring four goals in the Championship as he took the English second tier by storm. ""In my view, he has to fight to become the most complete player in the game,"" Clotet told The Athletic following the culmination of that campaign, with the Spaniard having left the club a few weeks earlier. ""He has everything in his hands to do it. He can touch the sky as a player - he has no roof.” That was something Europe's biggest clubs were starting to learn, too. In truth, given his performances for England's age-group sides through the years, he was on their radars already, as Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Barcelona all made their interest known to Birmingham before Bellingham had even made his senior debut. Arsenal and Manchester United joined that chasing park as the season progressed, but it was Dortmund who won the race, paying €25 million (£23m/$29m) for a player they had been tracking for the best part of three years. ""He caught our eye as an England U15 international at the end of 2017, and we then followed him again at the other internationals three months later,” Pilawa said. “There, the good impression (he had made) was more than confirmed, and we saw him get even better. From then on, things took their course. “We were among the first to get hold of him, and wanted to get him on his 16th birthday, when he was still the small, lanky player. We already believed in him then, and not just when he played in the Championship. “We built a good relationship of trust with his family, his management and him. We gave him a clear plan and a profile of his strengths and weaknesses, where and how we see him fitting in, and why his profile fits us and the composition of our midfield. “We told him: ‘You will have a lot of competition in terms of quality of players, but your advantage is that we don't have your profile in the squad, so you will definitely get playing time with us’. “At Birmingham, he was also used on the right-hand side and as a nine-and-a-half. But we told him: ‘You are not a six or a winger with us, you are clearly our eight’. In the end, it was a damn tough fight because the competition for him was immense.” 'Immense' is a good word to describe the reaction to Bellingham's departure, not least due to Birmingham's decision to retire the No.22 shirt of a teenager who had spent just a single season in the senior ranks before leaving. Criticism and mocking jokes rained down on both the player and his boyhood team, but Birmingham knew that the greatest talent that the club has ever produced, and perhaps a footballer who one day will be - if he is not already - regarded as the best player to have ever worn the their blue shirt, had just departed St. Andrew's. Bellingham wasted little time in silencing the doubters, netting on his Dortmund debut to become the club's youngest goalscorer, in what was the first of 45 appearances in all competitions during his first season of top-flight football. “We were reasonably sure that he would get enough playing time in his first year. But I admit that we didn't know how confidently he would handle his situation,” Pilawa explained. “There was Covid, the gruelling Championship season until the end of July and the mental strain of the relegation battle with Birmingham. He only had seven days off as a young lad and then arrived here with no holiday and a bit of the pressure of the high transfer fee. “So there could have been problems at the start of the season, but he surprised us there as well. We wanted to give him more breaks, but he didn't want them. “He is just so clear in his head and has such a strong personality, that in the end his development almost did not come as a surprise. But, initially I thought he would only be involved fully in the second half of the season.” Jude Bellingham has dropped the coldest album cover of 2021 🥶#UCL pic.twitter.com/eiEMU3oOEl Ten of those games came in the Champions League, with his performances against Manchester City in the quarter-finals showcasing to an English audience just how at home he was at the very highest level of the game. ""I can't believe it, maybe he's a liar!"" Pep Guardiola exclaimed when asked about Bellingham's performances against his side. ""He's so good for 17 years old, he's a fantastic player. ""There was one moment when he didn't get the ball from central defenders, how he shouts and demands that ball get to him at 17 means a lot."" A part of England's squad as they reached the final of the European Championship in 2020, Bellingham became the youngest player to ever appear in a knockout match at the finals. Clearly not the ""small, lanky player"" that Pilawa first scouted four years previously, he was now a physically imposing man, and in 2021-22, he has taken his game to a new level as a result. He has already bettered his best-ever goalscoring season, and is well into double figures for assists across all competitions with two months of the campaign still to go. He netted one of the Bundesliga's goals of the season against Arminia Bielefeld in October, and has a relationship with Erling Haaland that a number of top clubs from around the continent would love to have replicated at their own stadiums in years to come. The Bundesliga Goal of the Month...presented by Jude Bellingham 🤩pic.twitter.com/TsKGXuNNRJ Where exactly Bellingham will play next remains up for debate. Liverpool are routinely linked with him, with his all-action style in-keeping with what Jurgen Klopp demands of his players; Chelsea were interested in signing him in the summer of 2021; and Manchester United would love for Bellingham to take the same path as Jadon Sancho and swap Westfalenstadion for Old Trafford. Red Devils legend Rio Ferdinand has already described the teenager as a ""future Ballon d'Or winner"", and there are sure to be teams on the continent who are desperate for a player of Bellingham's talents to join them. Whether they can compete financially with the Premier League's biggest and best, though, is unlikely. Regardless, Bellingham has both the ability and self-confidence to make good on the promise he has been showing for more than just his three seasons of first-team football. He will not give up on reaching the very top. He will not let himself.

9990,Liverpool among PL clubs to approve ‘tougher’ rules on associated party transfers – Man City threaten legal action,"As per the Telegraph, the majority of Premier League clubs have approved the implementation on tougher rules on Associated Party Transactions (APT). Liverpool are among the 12 clubs that approved for these new rules.This would mean that there are now stricter laws over how a club can engage in sponsorship agreements or transfers with parties close to their owners.As per Sky News: “The so-called associated-party transaction (APT) rules are intended to ensure a level playing field among English football's elite teams by preventing clubs from signing commercial deals at inflated prices, thereby enabling them to spend even greater sums on players.”This comes after Newcastle United secured a massive £25m-a-year shirt sponsorship deal from Sela, a Saudi Arabia events company.Man City have been threatening legal action to the Premier League after these new rules were agreed upon as it could hamper their ability to sign winger Savio from sister club Girona in the summer.The Cityzens have reportedly agreed a deal to sign Savio, but it’s still not certain the fee they will pay to his parent club FC Troyes – who have loaned him to the La Liga club.However, Man City could face difficulties in engaging in further legal action with the Premier League as they are already caught up in a legal case concerning their alleged 115 financial breaches.1 year since Man City got charged by Premier League — why they haven't been punished yet'From docked points to stripped titles': Journalist explains what Man City's financial breaches could lead to",https://tribuna.com/en/news/liverpoolfc-2024-02-10-liverpool-among-pl-clubs-to-approve-tougher-rules-on-associated-party-transfers-man-city/,Uttiyo Scarnage,2024-02-10T07:57:21.000Z,Telegraph
1845,Chelsea sale on hold as potential buyers wait for clarity amid Abramovich sanctions,"The sale of Chelsea football club has been put on hold as potential buyers wait for clarity amid the sanctions imposed upon Roman Abramovich by the UK government, GOAL can confirm. Abramovich initially announced that he was passing on the stewardship of Chelsea to trustees after Russia began their invasion of Ukraine on February 24. The 55-year-old then went a step further and put the club up for sale, inviting bids in excess of £3 billion, but his assets have now been frozen as the UK continues to try and help destabilise Russia's economy. GOAL has learned that the sale of Chelsea is now officially on standby in light of Thursday's announcement. Swiss-American duo of Hansjorg Wyss and Todd Boehly, Turkish billionaire Muhsin Bayrak and American duo Jamie Reuben and Nick Candy have been among those to express interest in buying the club over the past fortnight. After seeing Abramovich sanctioned, however, investors and those involved in negotiations are now taking stock as they await clarity on the road ahead. Abramovich is unable to make any money from Chelsea while his assets remain frozen, but the club can still be legally sold as long as the UK government is involved in the process. The Blues would need a special license from the government to complete a sale and they would then determine the destination of the funds raised. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said of the situation: ""It’s fair to say the Government is open to a sale of the club, but it would require another licence. “We are now talking to Chelsea Football Club. Those conversations will continue. The important thing is under no circumstances of any sale would allow Roman Abramovich to profit from that or take any money from that sale. “The principle has been to try to mitigate the impact on fans … these measures are designed to punish those close to Putin and make sure any money generated can’t make its way through to the Russian war machine.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-sale-on-hold-as-potential-buyers-wait-for-clarity/blt84e3d027583774f0,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

7825,Stats show Spurs score MORE goals per game & have a better win-rate without Kane,"It's fair to say that Harry Kane and his Bayern Munich team-mates have endured a five-day period from hell.  After a dismal display against Bundesliga title rivals Bayer Leverkusen - which saw them get beaten 3-0 - Thomas Tuchel's side then lost a crucial Champions League clash with Lazio. After both games, ex-Tottenham star Kane was slammed by German media outlets for his lack-lustre performances in-front of goal - as he failed to score in either tie. While the England captain continues to come under scrutiny, over in north London, things haven't looked better for years as Ange Postecoglou continues to develop his youthful Spurs side. Here, Mail Sport takes a look at what the stats say about Tottenham and Bayern's fortunes both with and without the England talisman.  To begin our analysis of Kane and his influence on the pitch, let's begin with the statistics regarding his former club Tottenham. During the 2022-23 campaign, the England captain provided a staggering 30 Premier League goals as the north London outfit secured an eighth place finish. While Kane had been part of a defensive-minded Antonio Conte side, Tottenham have looked reinvigorated under current boss Ange Postecoglou. The Australian has had an unprecedented impact on the north London side and, even without the club's top goalscorer of all-time, has managed to change their fortunes. Stats, provided by Opta Stats Perform, show that in 2022-23 Tottenham averaged 1.64 goals per game, with an expected goal tally of 1.42 in all competitions. Now, without Kane, Spurs are averaging 1.96 per game, with an average expected goal tally of 1.66, which serves as a testament to their new free-flowing football. In place of Kane, the likes of Son Heung-min, Richarlison and Brennan Johnson have all stepped up with goal contributions for the north London outfit. They also boast an increased rate of shots per game - 13.4 from 2022-23 compared to 15.1 now - and shots on target per game - 4.9 last year compared to 5.7 this year.    Perhaps the most crucial stat of all, the club's win-rate, also falls in favour of Spurs' 2023-24 side - with the 55.6 per cent rate bettering last year's 46 per cent. Meanwhile, German giants Bayern have endured far different fortunes this season and look likely to miss out on any silverware in 2023-24. They trail rivals Leverkusen by five points in the league and have been knocked out of the DFB Pokal - meaning the Champions League perhaps represents the most viable trophy to win. During the last campaign - which saw them win the Bundesliga title - Bayern averaged 2.73 goals per game in the league. However, with Kane in their ranks they now average just 2.45 goals per game. This stat comes as an even greater shock considering that Kane has managed to score 28 goals in the German top-flight from just 29 appearances.   However, the Englishman's goals certainly do help them boast a better expected goal per game record than the previous campaign - with the current rate of 2.32 bettering last year's total of 2.24. They also average marginally fewer shots in total (18.4 per game last year compared to 18.3 this year) while the Bavarians have fallen drastically in their shots on target per game. In 2023-24, Bayern have averaged 6.9 shots on target per game which is a dramatic fall off from their 7.9 average last term. However, despite all of this, Bayern actually boast a higher win-rate this season than they did last. In 2022-23, they had a win rate of 67.3 per cent while this year, it is 71 per cent.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Stats-show-Spurs-score-MORE-goals-per-game--have-a-better-win-rate-without-Kane/3302417,,18 hours ago,all-football-app
8535,Touching story of how Jose Mourinho supported football referee in his fight against cancer,"Many people, even former Real Madrid players, remember Jose Mourinho as a fearless guy who was always ready for a heated altercation or a bust-up but in fact, Jose is a man with a big heart.Here is a story from his Real Madrid days told by former Premier League referee Mark Halsey. In 2008, Halsey officiated the League Cup final between Chelsea and Tottenham. Mourinho's side lost but the Portuguese didn't blame the referee. On the contrary, the manager and the official have enjoyed a great relationship ever since.Jose Mourinho and Mark HalseyWhen Halsey was diagnosed with cancer, Jose immediately gave him a helping hand.""Jose was in charge of Inter Milan and then Real Madrid at the time, so quite often he'd invite me and my mate out to Madrid to come and watch their games,"" Halsey said in 2022, as cited by the Daily Star.""He'd bring us up to meet the players and have dinner with the team - me and my mate Pete. Jose made sure we got looked after while we were over there.""When I was battling cancer, the whole footballing world was good to me, but Jose in particular was incredible. I put on a charity dinner at Old Trafford, the cricket ground, and Jose sent a video over for us to play on the night.""He took time out of his plans to put together a video, where he spoke about how he liked the way I refereed, he said I was like the 23rd player on the pitch because he could tell I loved the game and showed empathy for players and that I was very, very fair.""Mourinho's support helped Halsey win the fight: today, at 62 years old, the former referee is going strong and is a sometimes comes to Santiago Bernabeu.

The Reds went down 1-0 at Anfield, but advanced regardless thanks to their 2-0 victory in the first leg at San Siro.  They will now wait until the quarter-final draw on March 18 to find out the identity of their next rivals in the competition.  ""We need to start better from the beginning, we need to push a little bit more, maybe in the back of our mind we felt we were a little bit overconfident, but it’s a good game for us to take and learn from,"" Salah explained to BT Sport after the final whistle. ""It’s always important to win a game, but like tonight we hit the post twice, had a lot of chances, but that can happen in football and the good thing is that we qualified."" Argentina international Lautaro Martinez scored the only goal at Anfield with a stunning curled effort to give Inter hope of an upset, although the Italians suffered a setback almost immediately afterwards when Alexis Sanchez saw red for a second bookable offence. Salah, meanwhile, was unable to add to his tally of eight in this year's Champions League, and was frustrated by the woodwork on two separate occasions as Liverpool failed to score for the first time in 2022.  ""I hit the post a couple of times,"" the striker added Salah ""Maybe next game I’ll score three but the most important thing is that the team performed and we’re through into the next round.""

348,2022 World Cup Qualifier: Tunisia defender Montassar wary of Mali threat,"Tunisia defender Talbi Montassar insists his teammates have to remain focused to stand a chance of 'finishing' the job when they play Mali on Tuesday night in the second leg of the 2022 World Cup qualifier. The North Africans needed a Moussa Sissako own goal on Friday, March 25 to get a slim advantage, and will hope to get another positive outcome in Rades to make it to Qatar. However, the Rubin Kazan defender concedes the Eagles are not an easy team and they will be aiming at causing an upset. ""We are very proud but we are also staying focused because we are aware that we haven't finished the job yet,"" Montassar told BBC Sport Africa. ""It was a difficult game on Friday against a very good Mali team. We had a positive result but we also know that Mali is a dangerous team when they play away from home so we have to stay focused.  ""We'll try to do a great game at home on Tuesday to bring back the qualification."" This will be the third time the two nations are meeting in less than two months. The initial meeting was in the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) held in Cameroon between January and February. The two nations were in Group F and Ibrahima Kone scored the lone goal of the match to ensure Mali collected maximum points. In that particular match, which was marred by officiating controversy, Wahbi Khazri failed to convert the Carthage Eagles penalty. While Mali have never made it to the World Cup, Tunisia have qualified five times. The first time they qualified was in 1978 before waiting for 20 years to make it to the global competition again. The three other appearances were in 2002, 2006, and 2018 respectively. If they manage to get an aggregate win over Mali, the North Africans will be among the five nations that will be fighting for the trophy in Qatar.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/2022-world-cup-qualifier-tunisia-defender-montassar-wary-of-mali-/blt5151a419d2fc1b0d,Seth Willis,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

1831,NFTs & football: What are they & which players are involved?,"NFTs seem to be the only thing anyone is talking about, in the football world and beyond – so what exactly are they? Chances are you've seen the likes of John Terry and other footballers change their social media icons to one of a cartoon ape, or seen these types of digital art being traded. Certain NFTs have been bought for massive amounts of money. So what are NFTs, why are footballers trading them, and what is the deal with the cartoon apes? GOAL takes a look. NFT stands for ""non-fungible token"", which means a unique digital collectible that is tracked on a blockchain to prove its one-of-a-kind authenticity. The data underlying NFTs are bought and sold for very high prices, and can represent anything found online – including art, photos, match highlights, 3-D renderings of trophies and music files. One can think of NFTs as similar to real-life collectibles like trading cards or vinyl records in that they each have their own qualities. They cannot be replaced by the exact same specimen - or in the case of NFTs, the exact same underlying data - thus making them ""non-fungible"". Only one person can own something that's been digitally authenticated on a blockchain, despite others being able to save other, non-official versions themselves. Often, football NFTs are given added legitimacy because they are produced directly by players, clubs or leagues. “As a mechanism, NFTs make it possible to assign value to digital art, which opens the door to a sea of possibility for a medium that is unbridled by physical limitations,” Noah Davis, a specialist in postwar and contemporary art at Christie’s, told Wired. Kind of - but not really.  Sure, if someone on Twitter, for example, changes their icon to an NFT that they purchased for millions of pounds, any other user can simply right-click and save that image and use it as their own icon – something a lot of Twitter users have poked fun of. The point of an NFT, though, is that an item has underlying code attached to it with the proof of the buyer's record, meaning that only they own the official version. In other words, a right-clicked image would not be considered ""real"" because it's not backed by data on the blockchain. Nonetheless, social media platforms like Twitter are starting to introduce incentives to prevent an NFT being ""copied"" by others. Users who pay for Twitter Blue can have their NFTs properly authenticated as their icon, with the paid-for service allowing NFT users to have their icons displayed as a hexagon. For the already wealthy, buying NFTs seems to be a straightforward and successful investment, especially if they are also exceedingly popular. Footballers can use their status and wealth to buy up NFTs – which are pricey and can cost up to hundreds of thousands of pounds – and sell them at a higher place at a later date, a process known as ""changing hands"". “In the old days, retired players used to open a pub or do after-dinner speaking. Now we see people like John Terry using his millionaire lifestyle to attract supporters into buying into NFTs with the unspoken promise that it will allow them to access the kind of lifestyle he has,"" says Martin Calladine, co-author of Fit and Proper People, a new book about how football clubs are owned. Essentially, footballers are using their influence to get ahead in the NFT market, which is seen by many experts as an investment vehicle akin to other types of speculative trading such as the stock market. The NFT market is already a lucrative one for those actively trading. A Kylian Mbappe card for example, changed hands in December 2020 for about £47,000 (£65,000) on the platform Sorare, and this weekend, that number could be shattered by a one-of-its-kind Erling Haaland card. Former Chelsea and England defender John Terry has been active in the NFT market, having sold a “John Terry Ape” for an auction that eventually attracted bids over £5,200 ($7,000). These cartoon ape NFTs – an NFT project titled Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) – are particularly popular amongst celebrities and high-profile figures. They are available for purchase on OpenSea, an NFT marketplace. Reece James also seems to be involved in the NFT market, though it looks like he was given his Bored Ape NFT instead of purchasing it. Terry has successfully invited several current stars and former team-mates to trade Bored Ape NFTs, such as Ashley Cole, Tammy Abraham and Bobby Zamora. Paul Pogba has recently endorsed NFT project CryptoDragons, announcing his plans to purchase NFT Eggs. “I am happy to announce to you I’m partnering with a phenomenal project called CryptoDragons,"" Pogba said on his Instagram. ""This is my first time getting NFTs, so this is huge. You see I’m going to get some dragon Eggs so as you know what’s gonna happen - I’m gonna be the “Father of Dragons."" Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold was also briefly involved in NFT trade after he changed his profile picture to an NFT of Muhammad Ali, though he quietly took it down after some negative backlash from fans. Others, such as Antoine Griezmann, Gerard Pique and Rio Ferdinand, have invested in entire platforms such as Sorare that market many NFTs to users. Bored Ape Yacht Club is a popular NFT project that creates designs with apes. The cartoon ape features myriad designs, and each one is unique; customisation includes the changing of accessories, background and clothes. The cheapest “floor price” for BAYC NFTs – the lowest price at which NFTs can be bought – is 66ETH (£163,000/$220,000). A statement on their official website reads: ""BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bored Ape doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. Future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation. ""When you buy a Bored Ape, you’re not simply buying an avatar or a provably-rare piece of art. You are gaining membership access to a club whose benefits and offerings will increase over time. Your Bored Ape can serve as your digital identity, and open digital doors for you.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/nfts-and-football-what-are-they-and-which-players-are/blt30fca37d5dbe1a90,Cady Siregar,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

4546,"Gerrard should celebrate ‘like a crazy devil’ if Aston Villa score against Liverpool, says Klopp","Jurgen Klopp says Steven Gerrard should celebrate “like a crazy devil” if Aston Villa score against Liverpool on Saturday, with the Reds legend preparing for his first visit to Anfield in the away dugout. After cutting his managerial teeth at Scottish champions Rangers, the fan favourite on Merseyside finds himself back in the Premier League at Villa Park. It promises to be an emotional day for Gerrard, and Klopp can appreciate if the strong ties between club and ex-captain will be severed for 90 minutes. Having faced similar situations himself in the past, Liverpool boss Klopp told reporters of welcoming Gerrard to Anfield: “Wonderful story. I can imagine a bit how his feelings are. No sentiments, blah, blah, blah. “Meanwhile already Stevie is an experienced coach and manager and knows exactly how to approach games but he probably has no idea how it will feel when he steps into the stadium and out of the dugout. “I had that in a similar way the first time I went back to Mainz and the first time I went with Liverpool back to Dortmund. It's strange, you pretty much like all the people you meet when you step into the stadium and that's pretty much not normally the case. “When you go somewhere it is easier to be very competitive. I could handle it, Stevie will handle it. Stevie is friends with 99.9 per cent of the people working at Liverpool and the 0.1 per cent never met him as they arrived after him. I've never heard a negative world about Steven Gerrard since I was here. “He's a great guy and he will come here and want to win the football game and after I shake hands we will go full throttle and I remember when we scored for Dortmund at Mainz I forgot all about my story at Mainz and celebrated like a crazy devil. He is allowed to do that as well, I just hope he has no reason for it.” Prior to his appointment at Villa, Gerrard had been billed by many as a Liverpool manager of the future. He is now a direct rival, but Klopp – who has suggested that he will be taking a break from coaching when his current contract comes to an end in 2024 – believes Gerrard will head home at some stage. The German said: “Oh yeah. I think absolutely. The only problem is when is the right moment for that. We saw it with Frank [Lampard] at Chelsea. He is doing really well but is very young from a manager's point of view. “When is the right moment to take the manager's job? Not because he's not able to do it but how long do you want to do it? Is it the last job you want to do? The second job? Those are questions I can't answer, but yes I think it will definitely happen – and good for everybody.” He added: “It's not for me to make the decision. I don't know what you have to do before you become Liverpool manager. “I know people say you have to win things but I'm not sure about that. It is more important you win things when you are here, you don't have to win things in the past with all this 'proven winner' rubbish. You can win things in the past and never win things again. “The most important thing for each manager is that the club is in a stable moment, then you have a good chance to improve things. “Everything what he did so far looks good and he's going in absolutely the right direction – but what does that mean? I can't see a scenario where I will be involved in that decision but who knows what the future brings. We will see.” Liverpool are hoping they can avoid the run of injuries that stunted their progress last season, but more knocks are being picked up in 2021-22. Klopp said: “Diogo [Jota] felt something after the last Premier League game and he didn’t train yet. We will see, maybe he can train today and then he is an option and if not, then not. “Divock [Origi] was just intensity, we took him out for a day, extra recovery day and I think he will be fine for tomorrow. I didn’t hear anything different. “[Nat Phillips] unfortunately, it [cheekbone] is broken. It is not as bad as it could have been, so no surgery needed and he can pretty much train from next week on but reduced because everything that could hit him in the face could cause proper damage. “That’s why he has to be careful and make sure in the moment when he is allowed [to train fully], when the bone has healed, he will be in a good physical shape, so that’s great. How long it will take exactly, I don’t know. Four or five weeks, something like that. We will see.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/klopp-gerrard-celebrate-like-crazy-devil-aston-villa/blt341f27c0b4e8b7fd,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2148,'You don't know' - Di Maria worried about securing World Cup 2022 squad spot with Argentina,"Angel Di Maria is not resting on his laurels, with Argentina's 2021 Copa America hero insisting he is not yet certain of a place at the 2022 World Cup. The winger ended the Albiceleste's 28-year wait for a major title when his goal downed hosts Brazil in the final in Rio de Janeiro's iconic Maracana last summer. Along with Lionel Messi the ex-Paris Saint-Germain star is one of the most experienced faces of a squad which has been revamped in recent years under coach Lionel Scaloni. ""The only one who is already in is [Lionel Messi],"" Di Maria explained to TNT Sports when asked about his chances of going to a fourth World Cup finals. ""Four months from now you just don't know, I have to change my club, adapt again, play and feel good and that makes a lot of difference."" While Di Maria has been a constant figure in Argentina's team since the Copa America, he had been briefly held out of the team during World Cup qualifying last June. He knows, then, that the pecking order can change quickly. The veteran said farewell to PSG at the end of the 2021-22 season after seven years at Parc des Princes. Juventus have been closely linked with the free agent, who admits he was tempted by both the Serie A club and Barcelona. ""Juventus are the biggest club in Italy and one of the teams interested in me,"" he added. ""Right now I am thinking things through, but I am focused on my holidays and family. ""Barcelona are one of the best teams in the world and I have always had to play against them!""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/di-maria-worried-about-securing-world-cup-2022-squad-spot/blt74253889afa362c1,Daniel Edwards,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6514,'We've done a f*cking contract with the Saudis!' - More Pique leaked audio emerges as he urged Spain FA chief to get him in Olympics squad,"More leaked audio from a conversation between Gerard Pique and Luis Rubiales has emerged in which the Barcelona star can be heard urging the president of the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) to get him into the 2020 Olympics squad. Pique's role in moving the Supercopa de Espana to Saudi Arabia was highlighted in the first set of audio leaks published by 'El Confidential', as his company Kosmos convinced the RFEF to expand the traditional format of the competition. Spanish football's governing body signed a deal with the Middle Eastern company worth over €100 million in 2019 after Pique highlighted the potential financial benefits, and the defender also spoke to Rubiales about arranging a meeting with U21 national team boss Luis de la Fuente. Pique wanted to play for Spain at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, which eventually went ahead last summer after a 12-month delay due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Barca star wasn't included in La Fuente's final squad as Spain won a silver medal in the competition, despite having made plans to try and influence the manager's decision after the 2019 U21 European Championship. ""You have to do this for me, eh Rubi, you have to get it (a place in the Olympics squad) for me, damn it,"" Pique is heard saying to RFEF chief Rubiales. ""I'm excited that we play the Olympic Games. We have to keep it very secret and tell the coach (La Fuente) when they finish, in September or whenever.  ""When the competition is over, I'm going to Madrid and we'll sit down with him, man, and... I'd be thrilled.   ""Let's see how we can manage it so that it doesn't appear anywhere. I think this has to be kept very secret between the three of us until the end. Don't you think so?  ""If this leaks or whatever, there are going to be other players who are going to want to go and that is going to be a problem for him (La Fuente) too, so tell him, above all, that this stays between the three of us and that if he ever wants to talk I'll go to Madrid in a moment and we'll talk, okay?""  Pique also referenced the Super Cup deal with Saudi Arabia as he continued: ""And congratulations, man. I think we've got a fucking contract with the Saudis."" Pique described the publication of the first set of audio leaks as ""illegal"" and insisted that he had simply presented the RFEF with a golden business opportunity that benefitted all parties involved. The 35-year-old refused to apologise for his financial dealings away from the pitch, as he said on Twitch: ""Everything we have done is legal, I'm going to expose my part in the conflict of interest, I want to show my face because I have nothing to hide. I am proud of what we do at Kosmos. ""We wanted to change the format of the competition and make it more interesting for the viewer. That has repercussions on income. The president, Luis Rubiales, really liked the idea. ""Saudi Arabia was not the only option. The United States and Qatar were on the table. In the end, they decided to go to Saudi Arabia. ""I brought an opportunity for the RFEF. Before changing the format, they earned 120,000 euros for the competition, after the movement they earned 40 million euros. ""Regarding the recordings, it's an audio taken out of context. I simply help the president to find a formula that makes sense. It's an audio taken out of context. ""It's a malicious leak. What is news is the audio leak itself, which has been illegally leaked. Not the information in it. ""Do I have to apologise? For this? Well, I'm not going to do it, from here on let everyone think what they want.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/we-ve-done-f-cking-contract-saudis-pique-leaked-audio/bltfff0b2a4104f2c17,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8977,Anthony Martial ordered to 'train alone' after bust-up with Erik ten Hag,"Anthony Martial will no longer be part of Manchester United's first-team training after being ordered to do individual sessions, reports the Daily Mail. Tensions have been on the rise, with Martial reportedly refusing to leave the club this month. The Daily Mail understands the Frenchman was particularly below-par at a recent assessment conducted for all players returning from injury. Martial has not been deemed fit to train with the rest of his teammates owing to his poor form. Everyone knows Erik ten Hag demands the highest standards during training and it's no surprise they haven't been met by the striker. The report further adds that asking Martial to train separately is not due to a disciplinary issue; it's simply that he's not at the level required. Martial and Ten Hag reportedly disagreed on the matter and that led to the alleged bust-up. With Martial's contract expiring at the end of this season, it looks like he will leave only then. 'It's his job as well': Ten Hag appears to shift blame for Martial's continued absenceMartial rejects offers from three parties, his current stance revealed",https://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-01-18-anthony-martial-ordered-to-train-alone-after-bustup-with-erik-ten-hag/,Meghna @ 1819,2024-01-18T14:51:38.000Z,Daily Mail
10988,Das Ziel! The Bundesliga is Going Goal Crazy,"Despite the respective exits of Robert Lewandowski and Erling Haaland last year, the Bundesliga continues to produce goals aplenty. Beer, sausage and goals. Yes, that might be a good title for an autobiography of an old-school striker who wasn’t too focused on nutrition, but they are also three things you might associate with the beautiful country of Germany. Plenty of football fans have a soft spot for the Bundesliga, which has produced some of the best players in the game across the decades, and though the title race has been dominated by Bayern Munich since Jürgen Klopp’s Borussia Dortmund last won it in 2011-12, there has still been plenty of entertainment on offer. Who can forget when it was literally the only game in town? The Germans decided to get back to playing football before any other top league in May 2020 following the global coronavirus outbreak. Stadiums may have been empty, but plenty were drawn in and adopted Bundesliga teams for at least a few weeks before the other leagues resumed. In recent years in particular, the Bundesliga has seen plenty of goals. We recently took a look at the great Premier League goal explosion. The Bundesliga obviously read it and said: “Hold my stein.” As outlined in that article, Germany’s top flight regularly sees a high volume of goals compared to the other biggest leagues in Europe. Of the top 11 seasons for goals per game since 1992 in any of the Bundesliga, Premier League, Serie A, LaLiga and Ligue 1, nine have been in Germany, including the current season, which has seen an average of 3.17. The top five seasons are all Bundesliga seasons, with four of those coming in the last five years. The 2019-20 Bundesliga campaign produced the most at 3.21 goals per game. The German top flight was already producing lots of goals this season, but decided to go goal crazy again at the weekend, with lots of action at both ends of the table. Leaders Bayern set the bar particularly high as they thrashed Schalke 6-0 at the Allianz Arena, recording an expected goals (xG) of 5.3, the highest by a team in a single game in Europe’s big five leagues this season. Thomas Tuchel’s men wiped the floor with Die Knappen, who were caught, erm… ‘knappen’, again and again (sorry). Despite their wobbles this season, it was the fifth time Bayern have scored at least six goals in the league, an all-time Bundesliga record in a single campaign. The gauntlet was laid down to title rivals Dortmund, who responded by going 4-0 up against Borussia Monchengladbach inside 32 minutes, ultimately winning 5-2 to move back to within a point of the league leaders. Edin Terzić’s team seemed to want to prove a point, taking 34 shots in all against Gladbach. In fact, Dortmund equalled their club record in the Bundesliga since detailed data collection began in 2004-05, only once before having as many shots in a game – in a 2-1-win against Kaiserslautern in March 2006. It took Dortmund to a total of 53 Bundesliga goals scored at Signal Iduna Park this season, which is both the most by any team in the Bundesliga in 2022-23 and the first time they have scored as many home goals in a league season in 40 years. Not bad for a team that sold Erling Haaland at the end of last season. Dortmund have in fact maintained their impressive productivity in front of goal since selling Haaland to Manchester City. They averaged 2.38 goals per game last season in the Bundesliga (excluding own goals), with the Norwegian scoring 22 times. They are matching that output this season without him, despite the fact no BVB player has yet reached double figures for goals in the league, with Donyell Malan their top scorer on nine. They have actually increased their overall xG as well – up from 1.91 per game last season to 2.04 this, with their shots per game going up from 13.3 to 15.8. With Sebastian Haller starting to find his feet following his move from Ajax, having missed the first half of the season due to cancer treatment, it is perhaps less of a surprise that Dortmund are scoring so freely. They’ve hit 19 goals in their last five games, and 11 in their last two. They weren’t the only ones to see a goal bonanza on matchday 32 in the Bundesliga, though. Köln and Hertha Berlin started things off with a seven-goal contest on Friday. Hertha are scrapping for their lives, and after going one down early on, were able to turn the game around to lead 2-1 just after the half-hour mark. However, the hosts hit back and went 3-2 up before the break, before adding two more in the second half to leave Hertha on the brink of relegation to the second tier. Saturday also saw Bochum beat Augsburg 3-2 while Union Berlin defeated Freiburg 4-2 in the battle for Champions League qualification. After Sunday’s action – which included a thrilling turnaround from RB Leipzig to beat Werder Bremen 2-1 with two late goals – there had been a total of 42 goals scored on matchday 32 in the Bundesliga, an average of 4.7 per game. That total is the most scored on a matchday in the competition this season and just the second time since the turn of the millennium that so many goals have been scored on a Bundesliga matchday, just behind the 44 goals scored on the final day of the 2001-02 season. These numbers are all the more remarkable when you consider that, along with Haaland, Robert Lewandowski also left the Bundesliga at the end of last season as he swapped Bayern for Barcelona after scoring 35 league goals in 2021-22. Last year’s second-highest scorer, Patrick Schick (24 goals), has only been able to start 10 games for Bayer Leverkusen this season (14 appearances overall) and fourth-top scorer from 2021-22 Christopher Nkunku (20 goals) has only been able to make 18 league starts for RB Leipzig (23 appearances overall). The 2021-22 season saw 954 goals scored in the Bundesliga overall at an average of 3.12 per game, with last weekend pushing this season ahead by 0.05, which shows that new players have stepped up to replace the goals left behind by last season’s stars. Looking back further into history, though, this season is far from the most productive. Goals in Germany have flowed pretty much ever since the Bundesliga was founded in 1963. The very first season still stands as the second-best for goals per game at 3.57, though there were only 240 games played. The most ever was in the 1983-84 campaign, where an incredible 1,097 goals were scored in 306 games at an average of 3.58. Indeed, even if the current rate of 3.17 continues until the end of 2022-23, it will only rank 22nd in the all-time list for highest-scoring seasons in the German top flight. It might be too much to expect the Bundesliga to break 1,000 goals for a 14th time, with another 88 needed from the final 18 games, or an average of 4.9 goals per game from here on in. At some point you surely have to assume that someone, somewhere will successfully defend an attack. Whatever happens in the final two rounds of games, though, there is sure to be plenty more twists, turns and excitement as the sun sets on another goal-filled Bundesliga campaign. Prost!

3918,'Just f*cking sort it out!' - Berbatov fed up of Man Utd rift rumours after Ronaldo & Maguire captaincy row report,"Dimitar Berbatov says that any Manchester United players who have issues with each other should get it sorted out, and quickly, amid reports of a row between Cristiano Ronaldo and Harry Maguire. The Daily Mirror reported on Friday that there was a ""power struggle"" at Old Trafford, though Maguire has since denied the reports. The rumours have still proven an unwanted distraction, however, and Berbatov thinks any issue between the pair, no matter how minor, needs to be resolved. Speaking to Betfair about the rift reports, Berbatov said: ""There is always rumour and gossip going around at any club and who knows if there is anything in the story of a clash between Harry Maguire and Cristiano Ronaldo over the captaincy. Harry says that's not the case. I hope he's right. ""But if there is something to it then I hope they can speak face-to-face and sort it out. ""What is for sure is that this is not the sort of thing United need right now. United are fighting for a top-four spot, which they need to achieve. ""Obviously, Ronaldo is an icon in football, he's done it all and when you have a player like this in the side you need to use him, ask for advice and listen to what he says. He leads by example during training and the way he plays. ""There is a point for Ronaldo being captain because he has experienced everything in the game. On the other hand Maguire is captain and, okay, he may have had the odd bad game, but I don't think he would like to run from that responsibility. ""If there is anything in it, they have to come together, sit down, speak to each other and the manager and just f*cking sort it out!"" The Daily Mirror has reported that, amid a ""power struggle"" at Old Trafford, United captain Maguire feels he is having his authority undermined by the presence of Ronaldo. The report suggests that it is ""inevitable"" that interim boss Ralf Rangnick will pass the armband to the five-time Ballon d'Or winner at some point in the near future, with reports suggesting that cliques are forming in the Red Devils ranks. England international Maguire has been quick to refute the latest rumours, posting on social media: ""I’ve seen a lot of reports about this club that aren’t true and this is another. ""Not going to start posting about everything that is written but I needed to make this one clear. We’re united and focused on Sunday. Enjoy your day everyone."" I’ve seen a lot of reports about this club that aren’t true and this is another. Not going to start posting about everything that is written but I needed to make this one clear. We’re united and focused on Sunday. Enjoy your day everyone 💪🏻 @ManUtd https://t.co/YxLhQn8pqf United boss Rangnick has also been keen to play down suggestions of a split in the camp. Speaking to reporters ahead of Sunday’s Premier League clash with Leeds, he said: ""Well, to start with, I must say this is absolutely nonsense. ""I have never spoken with any player about a possible change of captaincy, this has never been an issue for me. ""It's me who decides who's captain. Harry is our captain and will stay our captain until the end of the season and there is nothing else to that.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/berbatov-man-utd-rift-rumours-ronaldo-maguire-captaincy-row/blte1ea946928c21db4,Tom Mallows,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3428,Barcelona hold 'very positive' Dembele meeting but contract negotiations to continue over financial 'red lines',"GOAL can confirm that Barcelona have held a ""very positive"" meeting with Ousmane Dembele's representatives with regards to a potential contract extension, but negotiations are set to continue over the financial 'red lines' currently in place at Camp Nou. Dembele has enjoyed a resurgence under Xavi since seeing a proposed January exit fall through, playing a key role in Barca's rise to third in La Liga and progression to the Europa League quarter-finals. The Spanish giants had been ready to say goodbye to the 24-year-old in the winter window, but are now eager to tie him down to fresh terms before his contract expires on June 30. GOAL understands that Barca's sporting director Mateu Alemany flew to Morrocco to meet with Dembele's agent, Moussa Sissoko, at the start of the week to reopen contract renewal talks. No specific proposal was left on the table and the two men did not discuss anything money-related, but a clean slate was agreed upon that paves the way for a potential continuation of the relationship between player and club. Dembele had been accused of putting financial gain above his goals with the team when he rejected the club's previous extension offers, but Alemany and Sissoko are now ready to forget the past and work on a new deal. Alemany confirmed Barca's desire to retain Dembele before their 1-0 win over Sevilla at the weekend, telling reporters: ""For us, he can stay as long as [any agreement] remains within the club's sustainable salary limit and is proportionate to his teammates."" Barca are set to continue talks with Dembele's representatives in the coming days, with it now their main goal to reach a financial compromise. The Catalunya outfit cannot afford to pay the World Cup winner an astronomical annual salary due to the fact they are still recovering from the record-breaking debts they posted in 2021. A number of first-team players had to be let go last summer as the club was forced to reduce its overall wage bill, including all-time record scorer Messi, and they won't exceed La Liga limits again under any circumstances. Spanish outlet SPORT has reported that Dembele currently earns around €14 million per year at Barca, but he would have to take a significant pay cut in order to stay put. GOAL can confirm that several clubs are interested in signing the France international if he becomes a free agent and, although his agent will try to be flexible in negotiations with Barca, he is still open to all avenues in order to get his client the best possible contract as he edges towards the prime years of his career.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-hold-very-positive-dembele-meeting-but-contract/blt795fbe255675d0de,Ruben Uria,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Norwich star Teemu Pukki is the lowest priced player to score the first goal at 11/2 (6.5), while Burnley striker Wout Weghorst is set at the same price. Norwich have been losing at both half-time and full-time in five of their last seven games at home in the Premier League while Burnley's spirits will be boosted after their midweek win. Backing Burnley to win half-time/full-time at 10/3 (4.33) is an appealing bet.

They have lost seven and drawn two of their last nine matches, leaving them seven points away from safety. Burnley are doing slightly better and at least picked up a much-needed victory against Everton in midweek. They are now just one point behind the Toffees and could rescue their season in the next couple of weeks if they can pick up some more positive results.

4959,"'When Klopp calls, you listen!' - Konate on Liverpool move & the differences between Premier League and Bundesliga","Ibrahima Konate has discussed his decision to join Liverpool, revealing the initial conversations with Jurgen Klopp that convinced him to come to Anfield. Konate moved to Liverpool from RB Leipzig in the summer and has been eased into the lineup, having made 17 appearances so far in all competitions. The 22-year-old defender has largely been behind Virgil van Dijk and Joel Matip in the pecking order, but he says that Klopp convinced him that he will have a big part to play at Liverpool. ""Yes, I spoke with him two or three times,"" Konate told Sky Sports. ""If Jurgen Klopp calls you, you think a lot about this! He does not call you for nothing! ""But we speak a lot, about me, my private life, about him also, the club, the mentality of the players, everything. ""It is not just me and him, you know, it is about everything I take this decision - the mentality of the club, the players with whom I will work every day, about the city, about everything and with this, I made my decision."" ""I asked him if I will play or not,"" Konate added, ""and he said, 'yes, you will play.' He did not tell me, 'yes you will play a lot like you are the first defender, or you will not play a lot like you are the last defender.' ""But it was always like that with me - when I was with Sochaux, when I go to Germany, the coach never told me, 'Yes you will play a lot.' ""No, it is always with me, I train a lot and after step by step, I win my place and why not with Liverpool I cannot do this? And this is good, as after this, I will work a lot."" Konate also opened up on the differences between life in the Premier League and the Bundesliga. The defender said the competitive level of the Premier League is something he's never seen as every game is a true battle. ""Of course - everybody says this,"" he said. ""You see this on the TV, but when you are on the pitch, it is more and more and more crazy.  ""You do not have a bad team, if I can say this with respect for every team in the Bundesliga, but sometimes in the Bundesliga you play against a team and you know you will win.  ""But here you never know - you play against the side last in the table, but it will be as difficult as if you were playing against the team who are first, you know? ""And this is crazy in the Premier League, the intensity and power of the teams, the mentality, the fans, everything is crazy here.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/when-klopp-calls-you-listen-konate-on-liverpool-move-and-the/bltb7b327e3df971bd2,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5744,Liverpool's golden boy Gordon has given Klopp a glimpse of the future,"At the end there was a standing ovation and a trademark Jurgen Klopp hug. A good day’s work, indeed. They think the world of Kaide Gordon at Liverpool, and you can see why. At Anfield on Sunday, the teenager served notice of his vast potential. His third professional game brought his first professional goal, and a well-taken one at that, as Jurgen Klopp’s mix of stars and scholars eventually brushed aside Shrewsbury Town 4-1 in the third round of the FA Cup. Gordon becomes, at 17 years and 96 days, the second-youngest goalscorer in Reds history, behind only Ben Woodburn, who was a couple of months younger when netting against Leeds United back in 2016. The FA Cup may not be what it once was, but it is still some stage on which to announce yourself. Gordon was in nappies when Liverpool last won the competition, but his quick feet and razor-sharp finish in front of the Kop set Klopp’s side on their way this time around. A home tie with Championship outfit Cardiff City awaits in round four. “That’s Kaide!” smiled Klopp when asked about the youngster in his post-match press conference. “Finishing-wise, he’s an adult.” #EmiratesFACup debut goal for Kaide Gordon 😁@LFC pull themselves level with @shrewsweb. pic.twitter.com/Zk7qLHKAxe Gordon, certainly, has made a big impression since his move from Derby County 12 months ago. Like others to have made the jump to Liverpool’s first-team under Klopp - Trent Alexander-Arnold, for example, or Harvey Elliott or Curtis Jones - he has the look of a mainstay. It is the first touch, the ability to shield the ball and play with his head up, to connect with team-mates. It’s the composure, the clarity, the confidence, especially when in and around the penalty area. “In these situations he is really calm,” said Klopp. “I will not say that for the rest of his career in these situations he will always score, but I'm pretty sure more often than not because that’s just him.” Gordon was not the only youngster to shine, either. Sunday's was the fourth-youngest starting XI Liverpool have ever fielded, with an average age of just 22 years and 187 days, but Klopp’s kids, as they so often do, stepped up. Conor Bradley, the 18-year-old right-back, recovered from a difficult first half-hour to deliver a performance dripping with heart and purpose. The Northern Ireland international was involved in two of Liverpool’s four goals, including Gordon’s, and will develop into a fine player once he matures physically. Tyler Morton, 19, performed well in midfield and it was heartening to see Max Woltman, another home-grown prospect, leading the line in the opening 45 minutes. Morton and Woltman joined Liverpool’s academy at the age of six, and have now graced Anfield and the San Siro together with the first-team. “I couldn’t be more proud of him,” said Morton afterwards. If that doesn’t bring a smile, what will? Elijah Dixon-Bonner, 21, had a tidy game too, and would have embroidered it with a goal had it not been for the impressive reflexes of Marko Marosi, the Shrewsbury keeper. In the second half there was a debut for Melkamu Frauendorf, an Ethiopia-born Germany youth international, and a first senior Anfield appearance for another young Scouser, James Norris, while two more teenagers - James Balagizi and Isaac Mabaya - were on the substitutes’ bench. “So many really nice little stories today,” said Klopp. It is Gordon’s though, which could have the greatest significance in the long-term. Liverpool, we know, will need to refresh and replenish their squad in the coming years, and if they can continue to do so from within, through the likes of Gordon, Elliott and Jones - who made an encouraging return to action against Shrewsbury - then what a result that will be. Klopp, of course, was quick to point out that there is still some distance to travel, even for one so gifted as Gordon. “He has time,” he said. “He will have his minutes here and there, and if he is working as hard as he did so far then…” There could be more opportunities in the coming weeks, of course. With Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane away on Afcon duty, and with Divock Origi still sidelined with a knee injury, Liverpool are certainly light on attacking options. Expect to see Gordon on the bench for the Carabao Cup semi-final with Arsenal, and maybe for the Premier League clashes with Brentford and Crystal Palace too. He will surely start against Cardiff at the beginning of February as well. Those are concerns for another day, however. Today, he can reflect on a job well done, on a dream FA Cup debut. His first big moment in a Liverpool shirt. It won’t be his last.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-golden-boy-gordon-klopp-glimpse-future/blt20265edba3420cc9,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4442,"Which football team does Novak Djokovic support - Man Utd, Real Madrid or AC Milan?","Tennis superstar Novak Djokovic is an avid follower of football and when he is not spending time on the court he is often seen attending matches. In May 2022, for example, the Serbian was found in the presidential box at the Santiago Bernabeu during the UEFA Champions League semi-final clash between Real Madrid and Manchester City. He was in the Spanish capital to take part in the Madrid Open, and he did not miss the opportunity to catch the home team in action. But is he a Madridista at heart, or does he support some other club? GOAL takes a look... It is pretty difficult to say that Novak Djokovic is a fan of one particular club. He has often been seen sporting an AC Milan jersey but on occasion, he has also expressed his affection for Manchester United. In 2014, some of the Milan players attended Djokovic's match at the Shanghai Masters and the Serb thanked the players on social media. He is also quoted saying, ""I’m a big fan of Milan and I’ll always be. For me, football is second only [to] tennis. My father was a professional footballer and at home we always watch the Rossoneri’s games with great interest."" The guys of @ACmilan came show support today, thank you @fbaresi & @jksheva7 pic.twitter.com/gTHTp3Obcy In February 2022, he revealed that he is in regular touch with Zlatan Ibrahimovic and wanted Milan to win the Scudetto. ""I am friends with Zlatan Ibrahimovic. We often talked about my situation in Australia. He also supported me publicly, which I really appreciate. I'm a Milan fan and we hope to win the Scudetto this year,"" he stated. However, there was one instance during Roland Garros, when he was asked to choose between Manchester United and Barcelona, he had no qualms about picking the Premier League side. In 2008, he took part in a charity match called 'Iker vs Rafa', at the Palacio de Deportes de la Comunidad de Madrid to help fight against Malaria. Four years later, he came back to Madrid for another fundraiser game called 'Alma Nadal', and the presentation was attended by then-coach Jose Mourinho, players like Raul, Alvaro Morata, and even president Florentino Perez. He was even handed over a Real Madrid jersey by Perez. However, there is another incident that might portray him as a Benfica fan. In 2007, when he was in Portugal to take part in the Estoril Open, he was found sitting in the presidential box of Benfica. The club gifted him an official team shirt with his name and favourite number (4) on the back.  He even got it signed by Eusebio after winning the championship. So to sum up we can safely conclude that although Djokovic supports Milan, he is above all a football fan. During the 2018 World Cup, he showed his support for Croatia and faced heavy backlash from his fellow Serbs. However, he defended his stand and said, ""Sports have their 'universal language,' they erase boundaries between people, overcome differences in religion, race, and nationality."" Like rivals Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic was also interested in football as a kid. Even now he plays the sport along with his team members for recreation. ""When I was a kid, I always wanted to play football,"" he said. ""Of course, desire for tennis was stronger. So I started playing tennis. I always watched football games at home. Wherever I go, I follow football. This is one of my favourite sports. ""This is something that I do recreationally just for fun with my team, with my coaches. I like it. It's a great atmosphere in the team."" In April 2022, he uploaded a video on Instagram where he was seen juggling with PSG superstars Neymar and Marco Verratti. In 2012, he played in another charity with Brazilian and global legends at the Estadio Olimpico Joao Havelange before a fixture between Fluminense and Cruzeiro - he didn’t do too badly for himself either, finding the net and creating another goal. Brazil great Zico even commented: ""Brazil has always had football magicians. I’m happy some of them are here today. I had played with [ex-tennis number one] Gustavo Kuerten before, he’s very good at football. But Djokovic is also good.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/which-football-team-novak-djokovic-support-man-utd-real/blt5c2dd27733bf7cb7,Soham Mukherjee,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11799,Teenage Dream: Bundesliga Duo Hitting the Heights,"It’s no secret that teams in the German Bundesliga do not shy away from giving first team chances to younger players, but there are two sides that do this more than their league rivals. Of the 10 youngest players to ever appear in the competition, just two haven’t come from one of Borussia Dortmund of Bayer 04 Leverkusen. Therefore, it comes as little surprise that these two clubs have provided two of the best young talents in the Bundesliga this season: BVB’s Jude Bellingham and Bayer 04’s Florian Wirtz. Let’s analyse the data behind the success the pair have had in their German top-flight careers to date. Jude Bellingham arrived at Dortmund before the 2020-21 season shortly after turning 17, and despite such a young age the Englishman became a permanent fixture in their first team more or less immediately. In his first season, Bellingham featured in 46 matches across all competitions for BVB, with only veterans Mats Hummels (48) and Marco Reus (49) making more appearances for Dortmund. Come 2021-22, Bellingham is one of the first names on the team sheet for Marco Rose’s side, starting 24 out of 26 matches in all competitions so far – a number matched among Dortmund’s outfield players only by club captain Marco Reus. To date, the English international is fully justifying his coach’s decision. As displayed by his touch map below, Bellingham is an all-action midfielder, feeling comfortable on every part of the pitch. However, he has played a wider role this season in the Borussia Dortmund side than in 2020-21 – a deployment that has also seen him get into the opposition box more often. Among Bundesliga midfielders, only RB Leipzig attacking midfielder Christopher Nkunku (119) has had more touches in the opposition box than Bellingham’s 53. Both Bellingham’s willingness to join the attack as well as his defensive prowess are perfectly illustrated by the following sequence from Dortmund’s UEFA Champions League home match versus Ajax, where he makes the run into the six-yard box, only to sprint back and make a perfect sliding tackle in the centre of the pitch to prevent a counter-attack after possession was lost. Bellingham has won 190 duels across all competitions this season, which is nearly twice as many as his next most successful teammate (Marco Reus’ 104), while he also boasts the best figure among all Bundesliga players this season – 25 more than next-best Lucas Höler (165). As an integral part of Dortmund’s high press, the Englishman also leads his team as the player to win possession most often in the final third (23). Compared to other midfielders from around the Bundesliga, Bellingham is one of the most prolific tacklers, boasting the fourth best tackle success rate among midfielders in the competition at 71% (minimum 15 tackles). In the league alone this has led to him starting four sequences that ended in a goal, a figure only bettered Bayern Munich’s Thomas Müller. However, the English international is also a standout performer when it comes to attacking. In all competitions Bellingham has directly contributed to 12 goals (three goals, nine assists). Among Bundesliga midfielders, only fellow teenage sensation Florian Wirtz (19) and RB Leipzig’s Christopher Nkunku (22) have provided more. However, those two players are deployed within their sides in a more attacking role than the Englishman. Bellingham’s vision, in particular, stands out. No midfielder from the big five leagues has assisted more goals from open play than the former Birmingham man’s nine. In fact, the only player among these who can match that number is Wirtz. In the Bundesliga this season, only Marco Reus (91) has been involved in more open-play attacking sequences leading to shots for Borussia Dortmund than Bellingham has (68), with his involvements nearly equally split between having the shot (22), creating the chance (18) or being involved in the build up to the shot (28): The Englishman is exceptionally adept with the ball at his feet. His 55 successful take-ons this season are nearly twice as many as those from the next most successful Dortmund player (Donyell Malen’s 30). Compared to other Bundesliga players from his position, Bellingham ranks joint-first for successful take-ons (30) and top for take-ons in the opposition half (39) among central midfielders. When embarking on take-ons, Bellingham can follow through to the end product, too, and there’s no better case in point than his wonderful goal against Arminia Bielefeld in October. Even when his opponents manage to stop Bellingham in the Bundesliga, it is often only unfairly, as the 18-year-old was the most fouled player in the first half of the 2021-22 campaign (42). Bellingham has also made a lasting impression in the Champions League. Earlier this season, he became the youngest player in the competition’s history to score in two consecutive appearances (18y 78d) – a record previously held by none other than Kylian Mbappé (18y 85d). While Erling Haaland is usually grabbing the headlines on Dortmund’s European nights, the former Birmingham man has been directly involved in four goals in the Champions League this season (one goal, three assists) for the joint-highest number among teenagers in this season’s competition alongside Salzburg’s Karim Adeyemi. Florian Wirtz made a huge splash when he became the youngest Bundesliga goalscorer at 17 years, 34 days old in June 2020 against Bayern Munich. He might have since lost this record to Dortmund’s Youssoufa Moukoko (16y 28d), but Wirtz has added a further 10 Bundesliga goals to his account. With his goal on Matchday 6, he became the youngest player in Bundesliga history to score at least 10 goals (18y 146d). To make things even sweeter for all fans of the “Werkself,” Wirtz took that record away from Lukas Podolski who had set the previous mark while playing for Bayer 04’s local rivals 1. FC Köln. Wirtz of course himself played for Köln’s youth teams before making the move across the river Rhine to Bayer Leverkusen in the winter of 2020. This season, Wirtz has become the focal point of Bayer Leverkusen’s attack which is, despite their form dropping off a bit of late, still the third most prolific in the Bundesliga at 40 goals, trailing only Dortmund (41) and Bayern Munich (56). On a personal level, the German international has been involved in 13 of these goals (five goals, eight assists), which is already two more goal involvements than he has had in his two seasons prior to 2021-22 combined (11 in 36 appearances). For Leverkusen, it’s their second-best offensive record after 17 matches in a Bundesliga campaign in club history, only surpassed in the 2001-02 season (43), when they famously ended up finishing runners-up in the league, the DFB-Pokal and the Champions League. In the Bundesliga, Bayer 04 have scored 14.3 goals above expected, making them the Bundesliga’s biggest xG over-achievers, while Wirtz has also proven himself to be masterfully efficient. The 18-year-old has scored his five Bundesliga goals from shots totalling 3.7 expected goals, outperforming his xG tally by 1.3. But the German international is not only impressing domestically. He has scored three goals and assisted another three in the Europa League in 2021-22, leading all teenagers in terms of goal involvements in UEFA competitions this season (excluding qualifiers). It is not just his goalscoring ability that makes Wirtz such a special player. He also has exceptional qualities as a playmaker.  His nine open-play assists across all competitions are bettered by just three players from the big five leagues (Kylian Mbappé, Thomas Müller and Leroy Sané) and is, as previously mentioned, the joint-best figure among midfielders. Among all players from the Bundesliga, only Bayern’s Müller has created more chances from open play per 90 minutes in all competitions in 2021-22 than Wirtz (min. 450 minutes played), while only Joshua Kimmich has played more through balls (16) than the Leverkusen man (10). The Leverkusen star has tallied 19 goal involvements (eight goals, 11 assists) across all competitions this season, despite playing a total of just 1,512 minutes. On average, the Wirtz is directly involved in a goal every 80 minutes – no other midfielder from Europe’s big five leagues has needed as few minutes per goal involvement in 2021-22 (min. 450 minutes played). Across the 2021-22 Bundesliga campaign, Wirtz has been Leverkusen’s most productive attacking player in open play. He’s been involved in 68 of their open-play shots, with 23 of those coming via himself and another 26 coming as the player to make the final pass before the shot. Lastly, if Wirtz is not already put under pressure immediately after receiving the ball, opponents in the Bundesliga have found him to be nearly unstoppable during this campaign. Wirtz has scored four goals from carries in the Bundesliga, assisting a further five strikes from such situations. His total of nine goal involvements following carries make him the most dangerous player following carries in Germany’s top flight in 2021-22.

7251,"Rare Ronaldo Panini sticker of Man Utd superstar at Sporting sells for £59,000","Cristiano Ronaldo’s appeal stretches well beyond the football field, with a rare Panini sticker featuring the Portuguese superstar during his early years at Sporting being sold at auction for £59,000 ($80,000). Now 37 years of age, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner has come a long way from humble beginnings to cement a standing as an all-time great. It was in his homeland that he burst onto the scene, convincing Manchester United to make a move for his services, and it is a sticker from back in 2002-03 that has generated considerable interest among collectors. The sticker produced by legendary Italian company Panini is said to be one of just 200 in existence. Many have either been lost or destroyed down the years, with only 22 considered to be in mint condition, making the product in question extremely desirable. ¡Siuuuu! 💪🏼🇵🇹 pic.twitter.com/NxNNB4vCN8 It also has to be noted that Ronaldo did not stick around long enough at Sporting as a senior star in order for products of him on their books to be produced on a mass scale. After catching the eye during a pre-season friendly in the summer of 2003, a precociously-gifted teenager was snapped up by legendary Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson. He went on to spend six memorable years at Old Trafford, scoring 118 goals while landing three Premier League titles, a Champions League crown and the first of his Ballon d'Or awards. Ronaldo moved to Real Madrid in 2009 and broke countless records during his time in Spain. He plundered 450 goals for the Blancos in just 438 appearances, while conquering Europe on a further four occasions. Three seasons were spent at Juventus between 2018 and 2021, with 101 goals recorded in Italy, before retracing steps to his spiritual home in Manchester. Ronaldo is now a global phenomenon, becoming the first man to pass 400 million followers on Instagram, and boasts a loyal legion of followers that stretches to every corner of the planet. With that in mind, it comes as no surprise to find that a sticker from his younger years was sold for close to £60,000 by New Jersey-based auctioneers Goldin. Jamie Salt, director of Goldin, said of the sale: “This card features one of the greatest players of all time in his earliest officially licensed trading card, otherwise known in the industry as a ‘true rookie card’. It was part of a set exclusively produced in Italy for the Portuguese market only. “Not many examples of this card will have survived through the years, with many people throwing away or burning them and even less copies would have survived in mint condition. “Only around 200 examples of this card have been graded by Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA). This card is just one of 22 copies in existence to have been given the Gem Mint 10 by PSA, meaning it is practically flawless.” Other cards and stickers featuring prominent players have been sold by Goldin recently, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s sticker from 2000 – while on the books at Malmo – going for $31,2000, while a Pele card from 1957 has sold for $486,000, making it the second-most expensive soccer card of all time.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rare-ronaldo-panini-sticker-man-utd-superstar-sporting-sells/blt42ea0392603c96e0,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8510,Mauricio Pochettino critical of his Chelsea players and himself after defeat against Wolves,"Mauricio Pochettino issued a damning takedown of himself and his Chelsea side's season by saying ""we are all not good enough"" after their 4-2 home defeat to Wolves. Pochettino's side fell to a 10th defeat from 23 league games this season as Wolves leapfrogged them into the top half of the Premier League with a convincing win - the visitors' first at Stamford Bridge in more than 40 years. Chelsea shipped four goals for the second time in four days after they were humbled 4-1 at Liverpool on Wednesday night, and faced the wrath of their home support at the end of both halves of a game where they barely laid a glove on their opponents, who had been tipped for relegation at the start of the season. ""I think we are all not good enough, that's the reality,"" Pochettino said. ""Myself also, as the first person responsible. Of course, what we showed today was that we are not good enough. I agree, 100 per cent. ""We didn't manage the situation properly, and I don't want to come here and say I am the best and the players are the worst - but the players have to take responsibility as I do. ""We are not matching the history of the club. We need to accept it and be critical, but we cannot give up. We have to keep working, try hard to change, take decisions to try to find things in a different way if it's not working in this way and find different solutions.""

Chelsea 2-4 Wolves - Report and highlights Watch free Premier League highlights Get Sky Sports Stream Sky Sports on NOW But after watching Raheem Sterling booed off when he was substituted, and a chorus of boos after Chelsea conceded their fourth goal late on, he pleaded for support during their upcoming games as his squad - the second youngest in the Premier League this season - look to rebuild their damaged confidence. ""What you can say is to apologise for the fans,"" he said. ""Perception is one thing and that's that Chelsea should be in a different position, but for different circumstances we are not there. ""What we can do is, most importantly, to feel the responsibility and of course we need to accept the organisation and the players we have. ""Then to understand the fans is really important. We want to apologise and feel sorry. We are disappointed like them but we need to fight altogether. If we want to take good results in the future, we have to stay together. ""During the 90 minutes, we need to work together to get a good result, and in the end they will be right to criticise or be angry if the performance is not good. ""The players are young, they need support, and I need to thank the fans who stayed until the end because they were supporting, and then at the end they are entitled to behave how they want to. ""We need to feel the confidence, to feel fresh to compete again. They need help from the fans during the 90 minutes and it's not to demand anything, but it's easy to sit outside watching the players run and play, and then when the stress arrives it is not easy. ""But it's why now what we need to do is be behind them and help them recover from these two defeats."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking on Sky Sports, Jamie O'Hara was stunned by Pochettino's side, saying: ""Chelsea... wow. There are players there on eight-year contracts. I wouldn't give them one-year contracts. ""Mudryk, £70m? He isn't worth £7 right now. He gave the ball away 15 times when he came on. Absolutely shocking. If you're a Chelsea fan, you'd be ashamed watching your side. ""They have fallen so far away from their previous standards, winning Premier Leagues, Champions Leagues. You go to Stamford Bridge and you never got a chance, you never had a shot on goal. ""Now you turn up at the Bridge and think 'here we go', rubbing your hands together. They are miles off it. ""They don't want to be there, half of them. They just want to play nice football like a reserve team, like there is nothing riding on it. ""Three points is everything in the Premier League. They are 11th! One of the worst teams I've seen this season. Awful."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Wolves manager Gary O'Neil was impressed with the way his players picked themselves up from conceding an injury-time winner at Manchester United on Thursday night, to recover from Chelsea's early opener and put their hosts to the sword at Stamford Bridge. Wolves turned the game on its head before half-time and stepped up their performance after it, scoring a third just after the hour before Matheus Cunha wrapped up a hat-trick from the penalty spot seven minutes from time. He said: ""The lads deserve an awful lot of credit to be able to put in that kind of performance physically, to be able to emotionally recover from that setback on Thursday. ""To fight back to 3-3 against Man Utd and then concede a fourth, then go down 1-0 here, it would've been very easy to accept a Chelsea win everyone was expecting, but everyone managed to dig in and fight back, and stick together. ""I'm unbelievably proud of the players and the staff. In the summer we signed three players, and lost a lot of players. In January we weren't able to strengthen, so everyone at the football club understands we need to maximise everything. ""We need to pull together from people working in the offices and the organisation, to the medical team who know I can't rotate the team much, so we have to go Thursday-Sunday. The work that goes in from everyone, I'm extremely grateful."" He revealed Cunha, whose hat-trick guaranteed his most prolific league season since his debut campaign in Europe with Sion in 2018/19, had come to see him after the Man Utd defeat to work on parts of his game. Their conversations reaped the perfect reward as he became the first Wolves player to score a Premier League hat-trick since Diogo Jota in 2019. ""We've spoken a lot about how talented he is,"" O'Neil said. ""He came to see me the morning after the Man Utd game to have a few words about the match and his game. He's a great guy who wants to improve things, and understand. ""All we've managed to do is turn an unbelievably talented player into an unbelievably talented player who has a real good understanding tactically of how things can be, the positions he can take up and he deserves huge credit. A Premier League hat-trick, especially at Stamford Bridge, is one to remember."" Correctly predict six scorelines to win £250,000 for free with Super 6.

3516,"'Saliba will walk back into Arsenal team!' - £27m defender is 'up there with Marquinhos & Thiago Silva', insists Mavididi","William Saliba ""will walk back into the Arsenal team next season"", according to Stephy Mavididi, who has insisted that the £27 million ($37m) defender is in the same class as Marquinhos and Thiago Silva. Arsenal spent big money to sign Saliba from Saint-Etienne in the summer of 2019 before sending him back to the Ligue 1 club on loan. The Frenchman joined up with his new team-mates at Emirates Stadium the following year but was left out of Mikel Arteta's first-team squad for the 2021-22 campaign and has since taken in further loan spells at Nice and Marseille. Saliba has impressed at Stade Velodrome this season as Marseille have risen to third in the Ligue 1 standings, and Mavididi is confident he will return to Arsenal in the summer primed and ready to make a big impact on Arteta's team. The Montpellier forward, who has been on the losing side against Marseille twice already in 2021-22, admits that Saliba is one of the toughest defenders he's faced in his career alongside the likes of Paris Saint-Germain's Marquinhos and Chelsea talisman Silva. “That guy’s a player,” the former Arsenal youngster said of Saliba in an interview with LiveScore. “He’s hands down one of the best defenders in the league, hands down.  ""I think he’ll walk back into the Arsenal team next season. When I played against him last year I thought: ‘How is this guy not playing at Arsenal?’. “He’s strong, good on the ball, he reads the game well. Sometimes you walk off the pitch and think - fair play man, respect. “The defender has kept up with you, out tussled you, out quitted you, you have to say fair play, this guy’s a good player. “He’s one of the best centre-backs I’ve faced. Everyone can talk about Marquinhos, Thiago Silva, Jerome Boateng, but he’s up there. “He’s the one that surprised me the most. I’m an Arsenal fan too and playing against Saliba I thought, we’ve got a very decent defender here!” Saliba is still waiting for his first senior appearance at Arsenal under Arteta, but the Gunners boss has hinted that he has a role waiting for him at Emirates Stadium next season. ""As a club we are always in touch,"" Arteta told reporters when quizzed on Saliba in October.  ""They went to see that game. Edu and Ben [Knapper, Arsenal loan manager] were there to watch him and keep a close eye on him and the progress he is making. ""I think there is room [to accommodate him, Ben White and Gabriel]. It will depend on what happens with other players.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/saliba-arsenal-team-gbp27m-defender-marquinhos-thiago-silva/blt4c45f5f0f83b014b,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

5124,Arsenal season review: A pitiful end to a promising campaign,"So near and yet so far. Arsenal fans will look back on the 2021-22 campaign with a massive sense of ‘what if?’ For so long it looked like Mkel Arteta’s young side were going to smash all the early-season expectations by claiming a top-four finish and securing a return to the Champions League. After such a miserable start, which saw them lose their first three games without even scoring a goal, a new look Arsenal started to emerge with summer signings Aaron Ramsdale, Ben White, Takehiro Tomiyasu and Martin Odegaard all making a major impact. Home-grown stars Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith were starring on a regular basis and it looked like they were going to propel the Gunners back into the big time. But a small squad and a lack of experience caught up with them just at the wrong time and a poor finish, which saw Arteta’s side lose six of their final 12 league games, led to them being pipped at the post by rivals Tottenham for the final Champions League spot. It was a hugely disappointing end to a very encouraging season. One that is now impossible to not to view as a big missed opportunity. There are certainly a few contenders for this. Aaron Ramsdale was exceptional after arriving from Sheffield United, producing several stellar performances to make a mockery of the criticism that came Arsenal’s way following their surprise summer move for the goalkeeper. Centre-backs Ben White and Gabriel Maghales formed an excellent partnership at the heart of defence, while Granit Xhaka was consistently impressive throughout the season in midfield. But the stand out players were Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka.  Odegaard was exceptional at times, especially during the second half of the season and has already proved to be a £30 million ($38m) bargain from Real Madrid. But Saka has been the star of the show for Arsenal once again. The 2020-21 player of the season scored 12 goals and provided seven assists in all competitions and deserves the award for the second year in a row, even if he did run out of steam a bit in the final weeks of the campaign. Alexandre Lacazette’s goal against Southampton in December was a thing of beauty. Aaron Ramsdale started the move, receiving the ball under pressure before finding Ben White. Some slick one-touch passing followed involving White, Partey, Tomiyasu and Odegaard before Saka was released down the right. The winger raced away before putting in a low ball which Lacazette side-footed into the top corner with a perfect first-time finish. From front to back in about 13 seconds. It was a superb goal that epitomises the way Arteta wants his side to play. This has to be the North London Derby win against Tottenham in September. After such a poor start to the season, Arsenal had just started to rebuild their campaign with wins against Norwich and Burnley. But the 3-1 success which followed against Spurs was the moment things really started to ignite. Arteta’s side destroyed their neighbours with three goals in 22 scintillating first half minutes and served notice to the Premier League that they needed to be taken seriously. There were other notable displays, including the 4-2 win at Chelsea, which came off the back of three straight defeats, and the New Year’s Day meeting with Manchester City when Arsenal produced what was undoubtedly their best 45 minutes of the season, before they harshly fell to defeat in the second half. But the win against Tottenham has to top them all. There are a few here. The defeat at Tottenham at the end of the season. Knowing a win would have guaranteed them a top four spot, Arteta’s side lost their heads as Rob Holding was sent off and they were beaten 3-0. The decision not to strengthen in the January transfer window and replace Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was also a major disappointment as that clearly left the squad short during the second half of the season. But having said all that, Arsenal still went to Newcastle for the penultimate game of the campaign with their destiny in their own hands. A win at St James’ Park would have left them only needing to beat Everton on the final day to secure fourth spot. So, to go and produce the totally inept performance that they did, losing 2-0, was pitiful.  That night in the north east has to go down as the disappointment of the season. There is no doubt that there were plenty of positives from Arsenal’s season. At the start, hardly anyone would have given them a chance of making the top four, so to go so close with such a young group does deserve credit. For the first time in a long time, it was enjoyable to watch Arsenal again and that was evident by the excellent atmosphere at games – both home and away. But despite all that, you just can’t shake off the sense of disappointment that they failed to get the job done. Fourth spot was there for them and they fluffed their lines at the crucial time, ending a promising season with a big feeling of disappointment.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-season-review-a-pitiful-end-to-a-promising-season/blt533349de65026c2d,Charles Watts,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
546,"Wilshere will 100% return to Arsenal, says Arteta after midfielder joined AGF Aarhus","Mikel Arteta has said that Jack Wilshere will “100 per cent” return to Arsenal in a coaching capacity. The midfielder spent 10 years in the Gunners' first team after coming through their youth ranks, with injuries playing their part in an exit from the Emirates in 2018. After subsequently spending time with Bournemouth and West Ham, the 30-year-old is now lacing up his boots for AGF Aarhus in Denmark. Asked if Wilshere would return to north London some day as a coach, Arteta told a press conference: “One hundred per cent. I think everyone at the club would be willing to open the doors for him and try to find a role for him that would work for everybody.  “I think that will happen naturally in the future.” Having spent time as a free agent since the end of last season, Wilshere had the opportunity to train with Arsenal while he decided whether to hang up his boots in favour of pursuing a coaching career or continue the search for a new club. Now on the books at AGF, Arteta offered the former England international some words of encouragement. He said: “Well, first of all, thank you for what he’s done all the time with us. It’s been great to have him, and I think I’m speaking on behalf of everybody and the club, it’s been absolutely a pleasure to have Jack back.  “To enjoy watching him play next to us, to have him around, the inspiration that he is for all the young people. Hopefully we can help him - we have helped him a little bit as well - because he had some doubts with what to do, whether to start coaching or continue playing.  “I think this group of players have given him again that necessity to experience - on a daily basis - how magnificent it is to feel like a football player, and I think he wants to experience that again.  “We wish him the best of luck.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/wilshere-100-per-cent-return-arsenal-arteta-midfielder-agf/blt67e1668c7b0818be,Stephen Crawford,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11063,Alan Shearer’s Final Match: 17 April On This Day,"On this day in 2006, Alan Shearer’s playing career finished. Fittingly for such a phenomenal goalscorer, he scored in that appearance for his hometown club Newcastle United against their rivals Sunderland in a derby on 17 April. His final season in 2005-06 also saw him break Jackie Milburn’s 49-year record of 200 (official) goals for Newcastle United in February 2006, with his strike at Sunderland seeing him complete his playing career on 206 goals at the club. Overall, Shearer scored 283 times in English top-flight league football – the fifth-highest tally of any player, behind only Jimmy Greaves (357), Steve Bloomer (314), Dixie Dean (310) and Gordon Hodgson (287). With those 283 goals coming in 559 appearances, he even managed a ratio of over a goal every two games across his 19-season playing career (0.51). In the Premier League era, no player has come close the Shearer’s exceptional tally of 260 goals in 441 appearances – a tally that could have been closer to 300 had the former Blackburn Rovers striker not suffered two serious injuries during his career. Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane has eyes on the Premier League goal record, but his 206-goal tally is currently 54 off Shearer’s tally and he is still two away from Wayne Rooney’s final total of 208 in the competition. With Kane only 29 years old, there’s every chance he will reach Shearer’s total in years to come, to add this record to his England national team record tally. Shearer was the most devastating player in front of goal across the early Premier League seasons, with 100 goal involvements in his first 100 appearances in the competition (79 goals, 21 assists) – unsurprisingly a record. In fact, his first 100 Premier League goals came in just 124 appearances, with the former England striker the quickest player to this landmark in the competition history. Those goals helped Shearer to three Premier League Golden Boot awards across 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97 – only Thierry Henry has won more (four), while Shearer was the first English top-flight player to win the award in three consecutive seasons since Jimmy Greaves in the early-mid 1960s. Shearer looks likely to lose his Premier League record (which he shares with Andrew Cole) for the most goals in a single season (34 in 1994-95), but Erling Haaland has some way to go to match Shearer’s record of scoring in 190 different matches in the competition. 🎶 “1-0 down, 4-1 up…” 🎶On this day in 2006! 🙌 pic.twitter.com/RW6t8iPQgZ Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

3535,Guardiola's warning: What happened to Man Utd could happen to Man City,"Pep Guardiola has warned that the struggles endured by Manchester United could easily be replicated at Manchester City if a dominant domestic force of the modern era do not take important lessons from the struggles of old adversaries. The Blues proved once again in their latest Premier League outing that they are very much kings in their own backyard by easing to a 4-1 victory over the visiting Red Devils at the Etihad Stadium. City are still in the hunt for three pieces of silverware this season – having collected 11 trophies since Sir Alex Ferguson departed Old Trafford in 2013 – but Guardiola is eager to point out that success cannot be taken for granted. The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss has said of his current employers, who have seen arch-rivals hit a serious slump since an iconic coach of their own headed into retirement: “The club (City) is so stable in what they want to do, the way they want to play, but the example we have to live [by] is that United could not expect a decade ago these years of living without Premier League [titles]. “We have to learn. It could happen here too. [We can't] believe we are so good that it is not going to happen here - it can happen, so quickly. “I remember Milan winning Champions Leagues under [Arrigo] Sacchi and [Fabio] Capello, then years without playing in Europe. When I was a teenager, Sacchi was the team all around the world we admire, and then this is what we have to avoid.” Man City 4-1 Man Utd.Manchester is BLUE 🔵 pic.twitter.com/C6TF7glPp0 Ferguson walked away from Old Trafford in 2013 on the back of a 13th Premier League title triumph in the space of 20 remarkable years. He also collected two Champions League crowns – a prize that has so far eluded Guardiola at City – as well as five FA Cup wins, four League Cups and the FIFA Club World Cup. Filling his shoes was always going to be a huge task, with the likes of David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskkjaer finding that out the hard way. Mourinho did deliver three trophies during his reign with the Red Devils, but the most recent of those successes came back in 2017 and United look unlikely to bring a five-year drought to a close in 2022. They are currently working under the interim charge of Ralf Rangnick, but the German tactician will be moving into a consultancy role at the end of the season and a big decision lies in store when it comes to appointing a new permanent manager. City, meanwhile, are still in contention for Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup honours this term, with Guardiola tied to a contract with them through to 2024.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/guardiola-warning-what-happened-man-utd-could-happen-man/bltcbf2c8e02b60f043,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7571,Conor Gallagher 'wants to stay at Chelsea' claimsÂ Mauricio Pochettino,"Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino believes Conor Gallagher wants to stay at the club, despite continued uncertainty over the England international's future.  Gallagher produced a match winning display against Crystal Palace, with the one-time Eagles loanee scoring twice at Selhurst Park. The 24-year-old's second goal in stoppage time gave the Blues a 2-1 lead, with Enzo Fernandez adding a third in the closing seconds. Pochettino insisted after the victory that Gallagher wants to remain at the club. The Chelsea boss, however, admitted Gallagher's future is something for the midfielder and club to resolve due to his contract expiring in the summer of 2025.  'What he told me was to stay at Chelsea,' Pochettino said. 'But then it's about him and the club. I'm not suffering with this type of thing, he still has one year more on his contract. 'I think it is a matter for him and the club.' Gallagher had been linked with a move across London to rivals Tottenham in both the summer and January transfer windows. Chelsea were reported to have been open to a sale due to profit and sustainability rules. A sale would have allowed Chelsea greater room to operate in the transfer market due to the sale of a homegrown player representing pure profit. Gallagher was believed to be in no rush to leave his boyhood club, with the England international set to be in an even stronger position come the summer as his contract runs down. The 24-year-old has made 32 appearances in all competitions this season and started 23 of the Blues 24 Premier League matches - with his only absence due to suspension.  Gallagher, who has scored three goals in his last two games, has regularly captained Chelsea this season. Pochettino hailed the midfielder as 'priceless' after the victory over Crystal Palace, noting his contribution in both attack and defence. 'He's a player with great commitment with the team,' Pochettino said. 'Always trying to compensate every situation in an offensive and defensive situation and that is priceless to have a player like him. 'I'm so happy for him and I'm so happy for the team because it's a victory we needed, the three points to confirm the reaction after Wolverhampton. 'It was a very good game against Aston Villa and it was a great opportunity.'",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Conor-Gallagher-wants-to-stay-at-Chelsea-claims%C2%A0Mauricio-Pochettino/3301272,,13-Feb,all-football-app
4887,Everton seal Premier League survival with dramatic comeback win against Crystal Palace,"Everton have sealed their Premier League survival after mounting a dramatic second half comeback to claim a 3-2 win over Crystal Palace at Goodison Park in a five-goal thriller. Frank Lampard's side looked set to take their fight to avoid relegation all the way through to the final day of the season after first-half goals for Jean-Philippe Mateta and Jordan Ayew left the Toffees unstuck. But goals from Michael Keane, Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin after the break delivered a remarkable turnaround to spark wild scenes on Merseyside. Having been sunk by Mateta's header and an almost comedy goal by Ayew, the Toffees were left needing a mammoth push after the interval in order to avoid dicing with the drop on Sunday. Michael Keane got the ball rolling nine minutes into the second half with a chopped flick across the box to earn Everton's first response, before Richarlison curled a shot home with a quarter-hour left on the clock following a deflection around the penalty area. But it was Calvert-Lewin's flying header with injury time fast approaching that finally put the hosts over the top to clip the wings of the Eagles, and the final whistle sparked wild jubilation as the striker was mobbed by delirious supporters in a flare-strafed pitch invasion. In Frank We Trust. ✊🎨 @GwladysSt1938 pic.twitter.com/t2OiMtX9Fl  ""We always spoke about keeping that belief,"" said defender Michael Keane to BBC Sport. ""We have come back from 2-0 before. If we got that early goal our fans would take us there. ""Our fans were unbelievable and I've never heard anything like it. Pure relief, it has been a hard season but so proud how the club has come together the last six weeks and a platform we need to build on and make sure it never happens again. ""I am buzzing for Dom, it has been a tough period but he has shown his commitment and his quality. ""We know this is something we never want to happen again. But you can't help but get caught up in the emotion. A special moment."" This was, rather incredibly, the first time Everton won a Premier League match in which they trailed by at least two goals at half-time, at the 75th attempt. The Toffees will now be in the top-flight for a 69th consecutive campaign, with only Arsenal currently on a longer run of consecutive seasons.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/everton-seal-premier-league-survival-with-dramatic-comeback/blt5a80c4dcaf414986,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11140,LAFC vs Portland Timbers Prediction and Preview,"Los Angeles FC’s title defense is yet to get started after its season-opening derby with the LA Galaxy was called off due to adverse weather last week, while the Portland Timbers, who had their game against Sporting Kansas City rearranged due to the elements, claimed a win to get their season up and running. Here’s our LAFC-Portland Timbers prediction and preview. LAFC might have won its last two meetings with Portland, but prior to those fixtures the Timbers were unbeaten in six straight matches vs LAFC dating back to October 2020 (W3 D3). However, if free bets were available then it might be sensible to place one on LAFC winning, given it has triumphed in all five of its season-opening matches over the franchise’s comparatively brief Major League Soccer history. In league history, only FC Dallas, between 2012 and 2017, has won its first match for six seasons on the bounce. As well as an eagerness to get its domestic campaign up and running, LAFC will also be keen to head into a Concacaf Champions League meeting with Alajuelense on the back of a victory, yet MLS’ champions over the past six seasons have opened their continental campaigns with a win just once (D1 L4). This will be the second time the reigning champions open their season against the Timbers, with the Colorado Rapids recording a 3-1 victory over Portland back in 2011 – the Timbers’ first in MLS. These sides last met in the penultimate game of last year’s regular season, with LAFC winning 2-1 in Oregon. The victory came in dramatic fashion with Denis Bouanga netting in the fifth minute of second-half stoppage time after Dairon Asprilla had canceled out Carlos Vela’s opener. Vela had earlier seen an attempt cleared off the line by Claudio Bravo’s head as Portland attempted to cling to a clean sheet, but he curled a sublime finish over Aljaž Ivačič in the 51st minute. Bravo hit the crossbar in the 71st minute as Portland rallied and its pressure built to Asprilla’s excellent close-range header 10 minutes later, only for Bouanga to weave his way through a parting defense in the dying embers of the match. His deflected finish marked his first goal for LAFC and secured the Supporters’ Shield in the most dramatic of circumstances in the process. It was a fairly even game statistically. LAFC had nine shots, putting eight of them on target. Portland’s shooting was more erratic, with seven of its 14 attempts hitting the target, though the host did finish with a slightly better xG (1.17 to 1.05). LAFC ultimately created three big chances – defined as an opportunity from which a player would reasonably be expected to score – to Portland’s one, however. It also edged out the home team on final-third entries (63 to 62), though did have fewer touches in the opposition box (28 to 36). Vela’s goal came from outside the box, however, scoring with a shot that had an xG value of just 0.04. There’s no last match to judge for LAFC, but it did win two of five preseason matches, drawing one and losing the other two. Defeats to Real Salt Lake and D.C. United came on either side of a draw with New York City FC, though victories over Toronto FC and the San Diego Loyal followed.When it comes to competitive outings, LAFC has lost only one of its last seven, winning four of those (not including the MLS Cup final, which was won via penalties after a 3-3 draw).LAFC has a fantastic record at the BMO Stadium (formerly known as the Banc of California Stadium), too. The club won nine regular-season home games in a row until a 1-0 defeat to Nashville SC on the final day last season.In its run through the playoffs, LAFC scored nine non-penalty goals – three in each match, from an average non-penalty xG per of 1.9 per game. Essentially, the club was scoring a goal more than would have been anticipated based on the quality of chances created in those matches.Allowing 0.7 xGA per game in the postseason improved on its regular-season average (1.0) and suggests its defense was trending upwards when it came to limiting the quality of opportunities given up to opponents, though LAFC was only able to keep a clean sheet in a 3-0 dismantling of Austin FC in the Western Conference final. LAFC conceded three goals from attempts inside the area during the MLS Cup final against Philadelphia Union. Portland, on the other hand, held on against Sporting Kansas City on Monday after Juan Mosquera capitalized on some slack defending to score in the sixth minute – the earliest goal across any games in the opening round. The Timbers have now scored in each of their last 21 MLS games, their longest such run in the competition since a streak of 21 matches between June and October 2017. Portland has tallied 34 goals in that time.Portland won two of its preseason games – against NYCFC and the LA Galaxy – and drew the other 2-2 against Toronto. However, it ended last season poorly with that defeat to LAFC followed by a 3-1 loss to Real Salt Lake, who secured a playoff place at the Timbers’ expense.The Timbers also struggled on the road towards the back end of last year, winning only once (at Austin FC) from their last five away games in MLS, albeit also drawing against the Columbus Crew. That run was proceeded, however, by a four-game unbeaten streak, which included a 4-4 draw at Minnesota United, a 3-0 win over the rival Seattle Sounders and a 2-2 draw with Nashville.To miss out on the playoffs for the first time since 2016 was a huge blow for the 2021 MLS Cup runners-up, but Giovanni Savarese will hope that serves as extra motivation at the start of this campaign. Vela might not be the same player that he was a few years ago, but the Mexican proved he still had plenty in the tank last season. He scored 12 MLS goals and provided as many assists, with only four other players in the league playing a direct part in more goals. Vela outperformed his non-penalty xG by 1.7, while the former Arsenal forward created 87 chances, ranking him tied for fourth in MLS alongside Lucas Zelarayan. His 12 assists did come from an xA of 9.8, suggesting he benefitted from some above-standard finishing from the players he set up, but the 33-year-old’s influence on LAFC’s attack was enormous – Vela was involved in 159 shot-ending sequences from open play in league play in 2022, more than any of his teammates. Last season was the first campaign since 2019 – when he scored 36 goals – that he managed over 30 appearances in the league, and he is still one of the competition’s best players on his day. Offseason acquisition Evander, who joined from Danish club Midtjylland and is formerly of Brazilian Serie A side Vasco da Gama, wasted no time in getting involved on his Timbers debut against SKC. The Brazilian had 59 touches, ranking behind only Mosquera in Portland’s team, while he attempted 37 passes, completing 28 (75.7%), with 11 of those attempted in the final third. Evander led the Timbers in crosses (four), dribbles (eight), successful dribbles (five) and duels (19), though he only won six. He did lose possession 21 times, two more occasions than any teammate, and conceded the most fouls (four) in the game, yet his nine recoveries were tied for a match high. Playing in an advanced midfield role, Evander’s next task will be to wield more influence from a creative standpoint. He failed to have a shot or craft a chance, but there were positive signs to build on for the 24-year-old. With striker Felipe Mora still recovering from a knee injury, the Timbers need scorers elsewhere in their team, and Evander will be one they hope hits the ground running in the U.S.  LAFC has won six of its 16 meetings with its Western Conference rivals the Timbers in all competitions, with Portland winning five times.Opta’s supercomputer has LAFC as a big favorite for this game, though, putting its chances of victory at 57.5%.Portland is at 18.7% with the draw at 23.8%.Expect this to be tight, though, with only one of the last eight games between these teams having been settled by a margin of over one goal – that came in LAFC’s 2-0 U.S. Open Cup win in May last year.

5636,'Salah's my guy!' - NBA Legend Steve Kerr hails Liverpool star & opens up on 'great thrill' of meeting Klopp,"WHAT HAPPENED? Steve Kerr spent three years in Cairo as a teenager and has returned to the city for the NBA and FIBA's Africa Basketball without Borders programme. The 56-year-old has revealed how he's become a Liverpool fan because of Salah and recently had the ""great thrill"" of meeting Klopp. WHAT THEY SAID: ""I started following the Premier League maybe five or six years ago and I had seen Mohamed Salah play and read about him,"" Kerr told ESPN. ""I was just so impressed by his character and what he had done in his hometown, helping to build a school. ""I knew how beloved he was in Egypt, so I said: 'That's my guy!' I wanted to cheer for Mohamed Salah and when I found out he played for Liverpool, I said: 'Ok, that's my team!' So, I've been a Liverpool fan ever since."" The NBA legend added on his encounter with Klopp: ""I met with Jurgen Klopp the other day in Liverpool, which was a great thrill. Watching the game [football], it's very similar in terms of concepts."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Salah has become a legendary figure since joining Liverpool in 2017 both on and off the pitch. The forward has been the club's top scorer in every season he's played but has never forgotten his roots, most recently donating three million Egyptian dollars ($156,965) to help rebuild a church destroyed by fire in Egypt. IN THREE PHOTOS: Salah posted a photo via his Instagram account on Sunday after Kerr's visit to Liverpool's training ground  DID YOU KNOW? Salah is just one goal short of becoming Liverpool’s outright second highest Premier League goalscorer. The forward is currently level with Steven Gerrard on 120 goals. Robbie Fowler tops the list on 128. WHAT NEXT FOR SALAH? The Liverpool forward is back in action on Wednesday against Newcastle United in the Premier League.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/nba-legend-steve-kerr-hails-liverpool-star-salah-and-opens-up-on-/bltaa4830ff20f191d8,Gill Clark,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5729,Ramsdale puts himself forward to take Arsenal captaincy as he delivers strong message to Arteta,"Aaron Ramsdale has put himself forward to take on captaincy duties at Arsenal from 2022-23, with the confident goalkeeper informing Mikel Arteta that he would “excel” if asked to fill the armband at Emirates Stadium. The 23-year-old only joined the Gunners from Sheffield United in the summer of 2021 and is yet to complete a full season in north London. A man that has ousted Bernd Leno from Arsenal’s number one spot, while earning senior international recognition with England, is of the opinion, though, that he is ready to take on a leadership role. With former skipper Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang departing for Barcelona in January and Alexandre Lacazette heading towards free agency, Ramsdale told FourFourTwo of the battle to become Arsenal’s next captain: “Listen, I’d take the responsibility but that’s down to the manager. “We’ve got a lot of strong characters, though, and a lot of people who I think would be good captains. “Just to be told 'you’re in a leadership role' – I’d relish whatever. You never turn down a captaincy and I think I’d excel if I was given the armband, but that’s down to the boss.” For now, with a captaincy call yet to be made, Ramsdale is fully focused on ensuring that he retains his starting berth in Arteta’s plans. He was fast-tracked into the Gunners team following a £24 million ($31m) transfer, with a debut made in a 1-0 Premier League win over Norwich on September 11. Ramsdale has not looked back from there, helping to keep the Gunners in contention for a top-four finish, but is aware that high standards must be maintained in order to retain a prominent role. He added on settling in quickly at the Emirates: “With Bernd Leno pushing me every day, I know I can’t sit back and take it easy, because he’ll take the number one spot off me just as quickly as I took it off him. “He’s been good with me – we fight for the same spot, but we have each other’s backs too. For me, it’s not about what happens months into the first season – I’d prefer to be judged four or five years down the line. “I thought [that becoming the number one] would be a process of four months, maybe a year, but I was ready. I felt settled straight away, knowing some of the lads, and the manager made it so easy for me by saying, 'Just go and play your game.' Once I’d got in, it was so comfortable for me to do my stuff. “The fans have been absolutely amazing with me, too. There was obviously a bit of unrest when I signed – people were talking about me being a second-choice goalkeeper, costing a lot of money and the relegations – but that just gave me added motivation to win them over.” Arsenal will be back in action on April 4 when taking in a short trip to London rivals Crystal Palace.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ramsdale-arsenal-captaincy-strong-message-arteta/bltd18cba163e03d4c8,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

8133,Erik ten Hag says playing with Casemiro will aid Kobbie Mainooâs development,"Erik Ten Hag believes playing with Casemiro will help Kobbie Mainoo reach his potential more quickly. Eighteen-year-old Mainoo has been the brightest part of a difficult season so far for Manchester United, with the midfielder establishing himself as an important member of the side. The teenager was given his chance following the hamstring injury suffered by Casemiro at the beginning of November. But the Brazil international, who is 13 years Mainooâs senior, is now fit again and they have played together in the last three games, all of which United have won. Boss Ten Hag said: âWe missed over a long period very important players like Casemiro, (Lisandro) Martinez, Luke Shaw, also others. We discussed that often. But you see the impact from a player when he is there, like Casemiro. âHe gives you calmness and composure on the ball. He gives you options, he does see the vertical pass. âHe is always a step ahead of his opponent and can break lines. Casemiro is a very important player for our game. We are happy he is back. âFor Kobbie Mainoo, he can learn a lot from it. That togetherness, that bond, also Kobbie is very coachable and Casemiro has so much experience. Erik ten Hag pats Kobbie Mainoo on the head  âKobbie will learn a lot from it, and that can even accelerate his development. We are happy to have him and, when they play together, they can benefit from each other. âCasa takes that responsibility. He has taken to him and he is talking to him. âI see it in the dressing room and on the pitch, also in training and in games. He is looking at his own game, but he is trying to help and support Kobbie Mainoo.â Green shoots have emerged among a troubled time at Old Trafford in the form of Mainoo and his fellow young guns Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho. All have been to the fore in Unitedâs improved form, which sees them head into Sundayâs clash with Aston Villa chasing a fourth successive win. Ten Hag is mindful, though, of not overplaying his rising stars, saying: âI brought them out on Sunday because it was the second game in nearly three days. âI brought them out against Nottingham Forest, the third game in a week, and I have to protect the player. âThey have to get used to the Premier Leagueâs intensity. You can only train this in the Premier League or Champions League where you have to perform every third day. âThen you have to make considerations about the team and result, but also about protecting players so they donât get injured. âKobbie was twice injured and we donât want to come into that situation again because it halts his progress.â",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Erik-ten-Hag-says-playing-with-Casemiro-will-aid-Kobbie-Mainoo%E2%80%99s-development/3299190,,11-Feb,all-football-app
7447,Rudiger denies decision to swap Chelsea for Real Madrid on free transfer was due to sanctions,"Antonio Rudiger has revealed that sanctions placed upon Chelsea were not he reason that he didn't renew his contract at Chelsea. The Blues suffered a painful defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup final as they fell short on penalties after misses from both Cesar Azpilicueta and Mason Mount.  With a free transfer move to Real Madrid on the horizon, the Germany international spoke after the match to discuss his exit and how he has enjoyed his five years at Stamford Bridge. ""I don’t want to go too deep into things. There was a chance but sanctions were not the problem,"" Rudiger told reporters.  Adding about how much he has enjoyed his time in west London, the Germany international said: ""It’s been five years with ups and downs as normal. There were a lot of positive things, but that’s why I’m even more frustrated because I wanted to have a different ending [with a cup win]. ""It’s about both sides. Chelsea have been great to me and I have been great for Chelsea. I am very, very thankful, both me and my family. I became a man here. My kids were born here and everything. London, and especially Chelsea, will always be special to me."" Chelsea have now lost five domestic finals in a row, with the last two having come against Liverpool on penalties.  ""I think it was a good game just like the Carabao Cup final. We had chances, they had chances. But at the end of the day we know that penalties are always a lottery and we lost. ""At the end of the day it’s about winning, it’s not about next season. The game was about today and it was there to take. Unfortunately we didn’t [win]. ""It’s always difficult to say whether we are lucky or unlucky. Personally for myself it’s the third time [I have lost the FA Cup final] so you can’t always say unlucky, unlucky, unlucky. ""It’s a difficult one to take for myself.

1482,'I'd have taken Balotelli!' - Italy boss Mancini's mother criticises team selection after World Cup failure,"Roberto Mancini's mother has weighed in on Italy's failure to qualify for the Qatar 2022 World Cup, stating that she would have picked Mario Balotelli for this month's last-chance encounters. Less than a year after claiming success at Euro 2020, the reigning European Champions will miss out on a second successive World Cup after they were downed 1-0 by North Macedonia on Friday. The Azzurri failed to score from 32 shots, leaving manager Mancini to face an uncertain future - and now his mother Marianna Puolo has weighed in, saying that she would have called upon the fiery forward who was omitted from the final squad. “Yesterday could’ve gone better, but this is football, sometimes things go right and sometimes things go wrong,"" Puolo told Radiouno. ""We had the match in our hands but the attack wasn’t great. “I would have called up Balotelli, because he has incredible physical strength and in front of the goal nobody can stop him. “Unfortunately, mistakes like Jorginho’s cost us. I don’t want to point my finger at him because he certainly didn’t do it on purpose, but if you miss three penalties..."" Puolo still feels that her son's squad has the capacity to challenge down the line however, though she made sure to get a pointed dig in at England, who Italy edged in the Euro 2020 final last summer. ""Macedonia only had one shot, maybe Donnarumma could’ve saved it but it’s useless to talk about it now.

6234,Klopp hopes his new Liverpool contract can be 'positive sign' for Salah,"Jurgen Klopp hopes his new Liverpool contract can be a ""positive sign"" for Mohamed Salah in his own extension negotiations with the club. Liverpool announced that Klopp has committed to fresh terms which will keep him at Anfield until 2026 on Thursday, two years beyond the expiry date on his previous deal. The Reds have enjoyed great success under the German, who has made plenty of shrewd signings during his six-year reign, including Egyptian forward Salah from Roma in 2017. Salah has hit 155 goals in 247 appearances for Liverpool since his arrival, helping the club win Premier League, Champions League and League Cup honours. The Reds could end the campaign with an unprecedented quadruple, but the 29-year-old's contract is due to expire next summer and he has yet to reach an agreement over a renewal. Asked if his new deal could influence Salah and Sadio Mane to extend their stays at Anfield, Klopp told a press conference: “That is more a question for the boys, what it exactly means for them but all fine, my relationship with them is great.  ""My point is in life there are more important things to think about, not only who is the manager but knowing who the manager and coaching staff is an important thing because when you know what you have with other clubs where you could go, you don’t know exactly.  ""There is no 100 per cent in this business but I think it is pretty likely I will stay for a little bit longer because other coaches are there at other clubs. I think it is everything is clear I this moment.  ""If it is a positive sign for the boys, great, but I don’t think this will be the one decisive thing for whatever decision they want to make. It is their own life but we just wanted to guarantee that everyone who wants to be here knows what he can expect."" Klopp also discussed Newcastle's acquisition of Liverpool's former head of post-match analysis Mark Leyland back in December, with the two clubs set to meet in the Premier League on Saturday. Leyland spent eight years with the Reds before being persuaded to take on a new challenge with the Saudi-backed Magpies, who have improved drastically since the turn of the year under head coach Eddie Howe. Klopp has joked that any inside information Leyland might provide Newcastle against Liverpool won't help them secure a result this weekend, though, telling reporters: ""They're on an incredible run. When our analysis meeting starts, we always see the last 10-12 results. Green is when you win, red is when you lose. It was like green, green, green then red, red, red. Then again a lot of green. ""They're obviously in a really good moment and Eddie [Howe] plays a massive part in that. They signed one of our analysts, that's for sure a big part as well I have to say. Mark [Leyland], if you see this, we will play a completely different team! ""They're doing really well and signed a few good players. That will happen in the future, 100%, with the power that Newcastle is now. There will be a lot of change, that is clear, but for this season, they made smart moves. ""They've brought in good players and just had stability. The players who were there before, where Newcastle fans probably thought, 'Oh my god, when will he leave?' They grow into a really confident figure as well. It's really good to see what little changes can make.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/klopp-new-liverpool-contract-salah/blt1040a441c8fa02fc,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

The 21-year-old made a slow start to life in the Premier League following his Â£72million signing from Italian side Atalanta last summer. But with five goals in his last five league outings, it is clear the talented youngster has the ability to cut it in the English top-flight. Since joining, Hojlund has taken to the field with a raft of quality performers, while there are also a host of top players featuring alongside him on international duty for Denmark. Of all the star names the striker settled on Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford when asked who his best-ever team-mate is, unable to decide between the pair.  'In terms of ability?' He inquired in a JD Football video on TikTok. 'Probably Marcus [Rashford] or Bruno [Fernandes]' Given his age and limited experience at the top level, the striker had a relatively small pool of players to choose from compared to some of his Old Trafford colleagues. Fernandes himself appeared in the video and replied to the question with his former United and Portugal team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo.  As did Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who also played alongside the five-time Ballon d'Or winner during his ill-fated 18 months spell back at the club. 'It's because of his work ethic,' Wan-Bissaka explained as to why he had chosen the 39-year-old.

6324,"Aston Villa want Coutinho on permanent transfer from Barcelona, confirms Gerrard","Steven Gerrard has confirmed that Aston Villa want to sign Philippe Coutinho on a permanent transfer from Barcelona. Coutinho returned to the Premier League in January, four years on from his departure from Liverpool, joining Villa on loan until the end of the season. An option to buy was included in the agreement, and Gerrard is eager for the Brazilian to commit his long-term future to the West Midlands club. Coutinho has impressed since reuniting with Gerrard, who played alongside the Barca loanee in the latter years of his career at Liverpool. Camp Nou supporters have not seen the best of Coutinho in Spain, but his current manager at Villa thinks he is well on his way to rediscovering his best level in England. ""Phil was successful at Barcelona but he had difficult periods as well,"" Gerrard said of the 29-year-old midfielder. ""He got to the stage where he needed a change of scenery and a different movie. ""We want to be that movie for him because if we want to get to where we want to be, we need to build it around talents like Phil, because at his best he is a high-level player. ""All good teams have game-changers who the opposition are really concerned about before a ball is kicked. Phil has that status and he is giving belief to his team-mates. ""Our strikers Ollie Watkins and Danny Ings want him alongside them because he delivers on the big stage. I don’t control transfer fees or wages.  ""All I can do is give my opinion to (sporting director) Johan Lange, (chief executive) Christian Purslow and the owners. They are watching the games and they will make the final decision. Phil has shown what he is capable of so far."" Coutinho made the best possible start to life at Villa Park when he came off the bench to score on his debut in a 2-2 draw with Manchester United on January 15. The Brazil international has since recorded two more goals and three assists in a further six outings, with his latest strike coming in a 4-0 victory over Southampton. Gerrard will likely hand Coutinho another start when Villa take in a trip to Leeds on Thursday, but it remains to be seen whether the club will cough up the cash to sign him outright, with his current contract at Barca still set to run until June 2023.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/aston-villa-coutinho-permanent-transfer-barcelona-gerrard/blta48b7f4269a68ad5,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1733,"Messi returning to Barcelona is 'not impossible', says Laporta adviser Masip","The prospect of Lionel Messi returning to Barcelona from Paris Saint-Germain is not impossible, says an adviser to Barcelona president Joan Laporta. Barcelona coach Xavi said last week that the door at Camp Nou will always be open for the Argentina star, telling reporters: ""As long as I am Barca coach, he is welcome any day"". Messi has had a difficult start to life in Paris and was recently jeered by the club's fans following their Champions League elimination at the hands of Real Madrid. While Enric Masip has moved to calm speculation about a possible return for the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner, he would not rule it out completely. ""Nothing is impossible, unlikely situations happen in life,"" Masip told Cadena SER.  ""Xavi's words were misunderstood. It wasn't a nod as such.  ""It was probably one of the most beautiful periods [for the club], but things went the way they did and he chose a project in Paris.  ""What may have seemed to be collapsing here in Barcelona, the team has survived and has worked well."" While Barca may not be pushing to bring Messi back to the club, they are eyeing one of Europe's hottest properties this summer. The Catalan side are among several top teams hoping to land Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund, alongside Manchester City and Real Madrid. Laporta admitted recently that he is not willing to risk putting the club in further financial trouble just to bring the 21-year-old to Camp Nou, and Masip reiterated that message this week. ""I refer to the words that the president said: the club is in a position to be able to sign players, but obviously, there have to be movements,"" he added. ""For someone to come in, someone has to leave. That is in the hands of the technical secretary and then later there is the economic part.  ""We come at it from an economic situation, but Barca has formulas and plans so that the team can perform at as high a level as possible.

Having already qualified for the quarter-finals, the Brazilians now play for prestige to end this group phase campaign in style.

But to enhance their table-topping ambitions, the Tshwane giants are hunting for three points in Omdurman where their opponents Al Hilal are unbeaten this season. Masandawana will be facing a team placed third in this group and keen to catch-up with second-placed Al Ahly. Al Hilal have three points fewer than the Cairo giants and they need to win by a three-goal margin to dislodge Al Ahly from position two. Sundowns welcome back midfielder Erwin Saavedra from an injury spell that has kept him out since February 29 when he was injured against Al Merreikh. The Bolivian was expected to return to action last week against Al Ahly but was preserved to gain full fitness. Doubtful for Saturday’s game is goalkeeper Denis Onyango as well as defender Mosa Lebusa, Rivaldo Coetzee, Gaston Sirino and Sphelele Mkhulise. Gift Motupa is our injured and will play no part against Al Hilal.  Al Hilal will be missing the services of suspended midfielder Salah Aahmed. The Sudanese giants will also not be having Malawi international Gerald Phiri who is injured.  Al Hilal and Sundowns both go into this match buoyed by winning their last games in this competition. Al Hilal edged their Sudanese rivals Al Merreikh 1-0 last weekend in the Omdurman derby in what was their first win in this group. Sundowns are also fired up after beating Al Ahly 1-0 at home to complete a double over the reigning African champions. Also inspiring Masandawana is that they defeated Al Hilal 1-0 in the reverse fixture at Royal Bafokeng Stadium. The two teams met again last season in the group phase with Sundowns winning 2-0 at home, before forcing a 0-0 draw away in Omdurman.

1434,"Juventus vs Inter: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Juventus hope to defend their Coppa Italia title this week when they meet Inter in the final on Wednesday. The Bianconeri beat Atalanta to secure the trophy last season but will come up against a side still in contention to win the domestic double this season. The Nerazzurri are currently second in Serie A, just two points behind leaders AC Milan with two games left in the league. At 5/4 (2.25) with bet365 to claim victory, Inter are slight favourites to win the Coppa Italia. Juventus can be backed at 9/4 (3.25) and the draw at 23/10 (3.3). Inter striker Lautaro Martinez is priced at 4/1 (5.00) to get the game's first goal, while Juventus star Dusan Vlahovic is on offer at 5/1 (6.00). Juve duo Alvaro Morata and Paulo Dybala, and Inter forward Edin Dzeko are all 11/2 (6.50) to break the deadlock. Juve are sure of a top-four finish in Serie A but are out of the title race. Retaining the Coppa Italia trophy is their only hope of finishing the season with some silverware. Inter already beat them in the Supercoppa Italiana and have taken four points from the Bianconeri in Serie A this season. They are also gunning for a clean sweep of domestic trophies as they remain in contention for the Italian top-flight crown. Simone Inzaghi's men will be determined to make it another successful season by claiming a big scalp in the Derby d'Italia this week.

5269,West Ham seal £30m Aguerd transfer - but who is the ex-Rennes defender?,"West Ham have spent big on Nayef Aguerd as David Moyes secured the centre-half reinforcement he has been after for some time, with the Morocco international completing a move to east London from Rennes. The 26-year-old defender has spent the last four seasons in France, with his stock rising considerably in that time. A new challenge in the Premier League is now set to be taken on, with Aguerd ready to slot straight into the fold at the London Stadium. The Hammers have invested heavily in Aguerd’s current ability and potential for future growth. Moyes has been able to convince his board that £30 million ($37m) is money well spent on the highly-rated Moroccan. He will wear No 27 for the Hammers. Aguerd's arrival will add important depth to West Ham’s defensive ranks as they ready themselves for a 2022-23 campaign which will include more continental competition. Welcome to West Ham United, @AguerdNayef! 🇲🇦⚒ pic.twitter.com/BDotHMUpEZ A seventh-place finish last season sealed Europa Conference League qualification, with Moyes having said of his desire to get more bodies on board: “The truth is, I’ve probably been looking forward six months to a year.  ""How can I grow it a little bit better and stronger. I’ve been at it all the time and I’ve never stopped thinking about the future and growing the club.” With Aguerd acquired, West Ham may now listen to offers for Issa Diop, with the 25-year-old Frenchman – who sparked talk of interest from Manchester United before suffering a dip in form – entering the final 12 months of his contract. Aguerd is a left-footed centre-half, and is considered to be an ideal long-term replacement for Angelo Ogbonna in the Hammers’ ranks. Across 31 appearances in Ligue 1 last season, he averaged one interception, one tackle and 4.1 clearances per game while also winning 3.1 aerial duels. He has won 25 caps for Morocco and was an ever-present during their run to the last eight of the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations. Aguerd also figured in both of his country’s play-off matches against Congo DR as they booked tickets to the World Cup finals in Qatar.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/west-ham-30m-aguerd-transfer/bltc0c5090c19150cb6,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8598,LaLiga report Jude Bellingham to Spanish FA for calling Mason Greenwood 'a rapist',"The Royal Spanish Football Federation has been asked to investigate Jude Bellingham's alleged 'rapist' remark towards Mason Greenwood, reports The Metro. LaLiga conducted an internal investigation after the incident first came to light during Real Madrid's 2-0 win over Getafe last week. After an on-field tackle went wrong, Bellingham appeared to mouth the word 'rapist' at Greenwood. The Manchester United loanee was charged with rape and assault of his partner but the victim then dropped the charges. The case never proceeded beyond that and Man United refused to let him back. Although Greenwood has impressed on loan at Getafe, it's unlikely he will ever play for Man United again. As for Bellingham, a former Man United target, lip-readers have agreed he used that word. If found guilty, Bellingham will be up for punishment by the Spanish FA as well as LaLiga.",https://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-02-07-laliga-report-jude-bellingham-to-spanish-fa-for-calling-mason-greenwood-a-rapist/,Meghna @ 1819,2024-02-07T10:21:28.000Z,The Metro

The Copa America champions and Euro 2020 winners met at Wembley to battle it out for the intercontinental trophy. The Albiceleste were deserved winners as they struck three times without reply against Roberto Mancini's team. Lautaro Martinez, Angel Di Maria and Paulo Dybala were all on target for Argentina as they secured the win. International trophies mean the world to Lionel Messi 🥺 pic.twitter.com/X8HFxtSRBy Lionel Scaloni's team were two goals ahead by half-time, with Messi setting up Inter star Martinez for the first goal shortly before the half-hour mark and Di Maria firing home in stoppage time. Messi got his second assist in the dying seconds of the game when he set up Dybala to make it 3-0. Manchester City's incoming attacker Julian Alvarez was also in on the action as he came on to replace Martinez after 84 minutes. The Paris Saint-Germain star was given the Man of the Match award for his stellar display against the Azzurri. 🇦🇷🏆 pic.twitter.com/nIIhRaBmLx As well as his two assists, the 34-year-old was pulling the strings for the Copa America winners, inspiring his side to a big win. The UEFA Technical Observer Panel declaired: ""He controlled the game from start to finish. He showed great skill to make the assist for Lautaro Martinez and more chances for his team-mates, and was unlucky not to score himself.  ""He has really put in a masterclass of a performance for the Wembley crowd; it was a joy to watch."" Giorgio Chiellini was rewarded in recognition of his exemplary performances with the Italian national team ahead of the game. The match at Wembley marked the end of the centre-back's caareer with the Azzurri. Chiellini bows out with 117 caps for Italy having won Euro 2020 and been part of the team that finished runners-up in the competition in 2012. Roberto Mancini admitted that the better team won the encounter, telling reporters:  ""They were better than us.  ""We were in the game in the first half but didn't do enough to turn it around after the break."" Speaking after his team's triumph, Messi said: ""We're here to play anyone. Today was a nice test because Italy are a great team.

6141,Why did Manchester United fans boo Paul Pogba against Norwich?,"Manchester United may have beaten Norwich 3-2 in the Premier League on Saturday, but all was not well at Old Trafford - as exemplified by the reaction to Paul Pogba being substituted. Boos rang around the stadium when Pogba was withdrawn in the second half, with the atmosphere toxic until Cristiano Ronaldo scored the winner with a free kick. Why was Pogba booed by the Manchester United fans? GOAL has a look... Supporters protesting before the game against Man Utd's ownership also vented their frustrations at the players, with chants and banners saying they're ""not fit to wear the shirt"" in evidence. Pogba has become a lightning rod for these frustrations with Man Utd's performances this season, with the club set to continue a trophy drought that has persisted since 2017. He is also a target for ire due to his refusal to sign a new contract, meaning a man signed for a then-world record fee of £89m in 2017 is set to leave Man Utd as a free agent - for the second time - this summer. With Man Utd drawing 2-2 against rock bottom Norwich at the time Pogba was subbed off, the anger of the fans once again came to the surface. Pogba then reacted by cupping his ears to the supporters - which will only further alienate the two opposing parties. Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick told Match of the Day of the criticism aimed at Pogba: ""I didn't hear it myself but I was informed after the game. 𝚅𝚎𝚛𝚢 𝚒𝚖𝚙𝚘𝚛𝚝𝚊𝚗𝚝 𝚠𝚒𝚗 𝚏𝚘𝚛 𝚊𝚕𝚕 𝚘𝚏 𝚞𝚜 𝚝𝚘𝚍𝚊𝚢! pic.twitter.com/KLZyu7dDeL ""I can fully understand the fans are frustrated, so are we, but I don't think they should take on individual players. I don't think that is right or correct."" On Pogba reacting to supporters, Rangnick told his post-match press conference: ""I didn't see it, I heard that. It was probably his reaction to the chanting of the fans. ""As I said, I can understand in a way the fans and supporters but it doesn't make sense to take on individual players."" Pogba's deal expires in the summer, and with no new agreement on the horizon, it seems increasingly likely the World Cup winner will be moving on once again. While there is still time for a deal to be reached, Pogba is being linked heavily with a move, with PSG or a return to Juventus the most commonly mooted options.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-fans-boo-paul-pogba-norwich/blt806eb9fa127702c4,Emma Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
9754,Why was RB Leipzig’s goal controversially ruled out? Lunin answers,"RB Leipzig had a controversial decision go against them in Tuesday's Champions League clash. The referee disallowed a seemingly perfect goal as they dominated Real Madrid in a game that ended 0-1.Two minutes in and the controversy sent fans into a fury in Leipzig. A corner kick in favour of the home team flew very close and Lunin cleared it with his fists.The ball landed on the edge of the area, where Schlager hit it back over the defence which became a perfect assist for Sesko, who headed the ball into the open net.Initially, it looked as though Benjamin Sesko was offside, but the replay showed that Rodrygo kept him in a legal position. So the fans were rightly quizzical when referee Irfan Peljto blew for what was signalled as offside.At the moment Schlager’s volley was sent in, Henrichs, in an offside position, blocked Lunin from behind, meaning that he interfered with play from an ilegal position and, as it ended in a goal, it was disallowed.“He was putting me off, I think you can interpret it as a foul. I don’t know,"" Andrey Lunin said. ""After I punched it, the player shot from the edge of the box.""Then I took a couple of steps forward because I didn’t have time to get back in position and I stayed high so I could react if the ball came back in. I think he called it for offside.” Was Leipzig's disallowed goal v Real Madrid the right call?",https://tribuna.com/en/news/realmadrid-2024-02-14-why-was-rb-leipzigs-goal-controversially-ruled-out-lunin-answers/,Toby Prince,2024-02-14T09:30:09.000Z,Madrid Universal
46,Nunez shushes trolls after missed chances & delivers message to doubters after £64m Liverpool transfer,"Darwin Nunez is only a matter of minutes into his Liverpool career, but the Uruguay striker is already having to contend with online trolls that are ready to write him off as a £64-million ($79m) flop. The 23-year-old striker has been in pre-season action for the Reds, with a couple of chances passing him by during outings against Manchester United and Crystal Palace. Nunez's pedigree, which includes 34 goals for Benfica last season, suggests that he knows his way to the back of the net, and the highly-rated South American is not about to let a few detractors get to him as he takes to shushing away their criticism. Nunez took aim at any doubters following his second-half appearance in the 2-0 victory over Palace in Singapore during which Jordan Henderson and Mohamed Salah were on target. One opportunity did come and go for the South American, with a slight deflection doing him few favours as Vicente Guaita kept out a close-range effort. After seeing some suggest that he should have opened his account by now, Nunez has stated that his “resilience” will not be knocked and that anybody questioning him should zip their mouth. Resiliencia 🤫 pic.twitter.com/e90QJAdpc7 Liverpool will be back in action on Thursday once they have returned to Europe from a trip to Asia. They are due to face Bundesliga outfit RB Leipzig, with Nunez likely to see more game time in that contest.

10466,Where On the Pitch Does Each Premier League Team Attack From?,"Zone 14 – the area located in the middle of the pitch immediately outside the opposition’s penalty box – is often described as the zone teams should try to get the ball into as often as possible in order to maximise their ability to score more goals. The problem is it can also be the most congested part of the pitch and requires players to have the technical ability needed to thread passes through the opposition’s defence.  Click the column headings to sort the table below: It might come as no surprise then, that Manchester City lead the Premier League for chances created through the middle third as a proportion of their total (42.9%). No player has created more chances from that zone in the league than Phil Foden (13), who leads Man City overall for chances created this season, both from open play and when you include set pieces.  Julián Álvarez, who is playing a slightly deeper role this season, has also chipped in with 12 chances from the middle third. Foden’s 13 chances created in the middle third is tied with James Maddison, and his creative brilliance is why Tottenham are second highest (38.3%) for the proportion of their chances that come via central areas. Son Heung-min has also been highly effective playing through the middle as a central striker and, as well as being the team’s top scorer, is their third-most creative player from open play (2.0 chances per 90). Overall, Son has created 10 chances in the middle third. Perhaps surprisingly, it is Everton who are next (38%), with the charging Abdoulaye Doucouré a strong creative force this season. He leads Sean Dyche’s side for chances created (16) and half of those have come via the middle third. At the opposite end of the spectrum are Arsenal, who have created a league-low 22.3% of their chances through central areas. That’s a huge drop of 13.5% from last season, when Martin Ødegaard and Bukayo Saka caused havoc in central areas, in an attack that saw Arsenal rank in the top five for the proportion of chances they created centrally. Those chances have shifted to the right-hand side this year, with Mikel Arteta’s side leading the league for chances created via the right third of the pitch (49.5%). It’s the same players that are causing the damage, though. Saka’s created 19 chances from that side – only Newcastle’s Kieran Trippier has created more (22) – and Ødegaard’s production seems to have also moved out wide. The Norwegian created 45.3% of his chances centrally last term but that’s fallen to 26.7%, with 60% of his production now coming from the right. West Ham are similarly right-side dominated, and their threat has come from the set-piece delivery of James Ward-Prowse (15) and the marauding Vladimir Coufal (13).  The Czech full-back is enjoying his best season for a few years, already delivering as many assists this campaign as he did across the entirety of last season, despite playing 18 fewer games. His chance creation numbers overall are back at the levels of his first season at West Ham, when Coufal finished runner-up in their ‘Hammer of the Year’ award. Bournemouth (42.7%) and Chelsea (41.9%) come next in terms of those creating the most from the right attacking third. While Bournemouth’s threat from the right is evenly shared between multiple players, Enzo Fernández, who has created eight chances from that zone, has been effective as a right-sided 8 with license to push forward, while Sterling (also eight chances) has been a good outlet. Manchester City create a league-low 19% of their chances from the right-hand side, a massive 11.2% drop from their production last season. Here’s where we can really see the absence of Kevin De Bruyne. The Belgian midfielder has made the right half-space his best friend over recent seasons and created a team-high 43 chances from the right third for City last season. That production has completely gone with his injury. Similarly, the departure of Riyad Mahrez, who was able to go past players on the outside as well as cutting in, has seen City really focus on creating chances in the middle and left thirds. Brighton (24.4%) also rank towards the bottom for right attacking third chance creation, instead choosing to utilise the ball-carrying skills of Kaoru Mitoma and, before his injury, the relentless engine of Pervis Estupiñán on the left. Between the two of them, they’ve created just shy of half of all Brighton’s chances from that left zone this season.  Luton (44.2%) rank the highest for the proportion of chances they created from the left attacking third. Alfie Doughty has been a bright point in an otherwise difficult start to Premier League life for Luton. The young left-back has created more chances from the left third of the pitch than any player in the Premier League (16), with his whipped crosses from corners a particularly effective way for Luton to generate chances.  Rob Edwards’ side have created 42 chances from set pieces in total this season, worth a combined 3.1 expected goals. Both those figures are in the top eight among all teams in the league. Doughty’s deliveries will be crucial if Luton are to keep their head above water. Lastly, Nottingham Forest are an interesting case. Last season, they created a higher percentage of their chances via central areas than any other side (43.7%). Pretty much all of that was thanks to Morgan Gibbs-White, who not only played almost every single minute for Forest, but created all their chances too. He fashioned 59 chances in the attacking half last season, over double that of the next-highest Forest player, Brennan Johnson, and 23 of those came in the middle third. That chance creation is still there from Gibbs-White – he’s actually creating more per 90 this season than last – it’s just shifted out right. His touch zone comparison map above shows just how many more touches he’s making in the right attacking third. Forest’s chances created via the right flank have increased by 10.1% this season and it’s no surprise that’s where Gibbs-White is spending more of his time. Enjoy this?

409,'There is one missing' - Ancelotti reveals special motivational video he showed Real Madrid stars to inspire Man City miracle,"Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has revealed that he prepared a special motivational video for his players ahead of their Champions League semi-final second leg clash against Manchester City. Ancelotti's Blancos went into the match at Santiago Bernabeu having to make up a goal deficit, with City having won the first leg 4-3 at the Etihad Stadium – although missed chances meant the hosts could have won by a far bigger margin. As such, failure to be more clinical offered Madrid hope going into the second leg, and the Italian head coach added his own additional inspiration ahead of the crunch match-up. After the match, Ancelotti told Movistar: “The video I showed the team before we took to the pitch was of all the comebacks we have already made this season – which is eight in total. The video ended with the message: 'There is one missing'. And we succeeded. “The greatness of this club is that it never lets you down. When all seems lost, it gives you the strength to continue, to fight, to believe.  He added: “We had a good match against a great team. We called on our reserves to equalise and win. “Reaching the final is already a success. Now we're very close to winning it.” Real Madrid will face Liverpool in the Champions League final on May 28 at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis. Already the most decorated side in European football's history, Los Blancos will take their tally of titles to 14 if they are successful, while Liverpool will move level with AC Milan (7) if they are victorious in France.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/one-missing-ancelotti-special-motivational-video-real-madrid-man-/blt1b50615d5cf7e764,Stephen Crawford,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6048,Osimhen boost for Napoli ahead of Fiorentina showdown in Serie A,"Victor Osimhen has been declared injury-free by Napoli and he is expected to feature in the Parthenopeans' Serie A fixture against Fiorentina. The former Lille striker was a major doubt for the showdown having been forced off prematurely at the Konami Training Centre on Wednesday because of a knock on his left thigh. However, the Naples based outfit conducted scans on the Nigeria international and the results showed he had not suffered any form of injury. “After complaining of a feeling of discomfort during training yesterday Victor Osimhen was seen by the club's medical staff,” a statement by the club website read. “The Nigerian forward underwent tests and it was determined that he hadn't suffered an injury. “Today [Wednesday] Osimhen followed a personalised schedule in training, covering gym and pitch work.” This update is a massive boost for manager Luciano Spalletti who would be aiming to garner all points against the Stadio Artemio Franchi giants.  Should he feature against Vincenzo Italiano’s men and hopefully score, Osimhen will increase his goal tally in the 2021-22 campaign to 12. The African missed the Parthenopeans' 3-1 victory at Atalanta over the weekend due to a card suspension.  Since his big-money move from Ligue 1 club Lille to Napoli in August 2020, the Lagos-born goal machine has been a key figure in the Naples based squad. In a related development, Elif Elmas disclosed his teammates are fired up to secure victory as they crave to end the season on a high.  “We’re so fired up; we’re keen to end the season on a high,” he told Radio Kiss Kiss, as per the club website. “The squad is excited and determined. We’re preparing meticulously for Sunday’s game; we’re totally focused.“Fiorentina are a tough opponent and we’ve got to play to the best of our abilities if we’re to come away with three points. “We have total faith in what we have to offer as a team; we’ve got the potential to win this league. We won’t throw the towel in until it’s all said and done.” Victory for Napoli against Fiorentina will keep their title bid on track.

7175,Explained: Why West Ham fans threw money at Jesse Lingard in Nottingham Forest game,"Former Manchester United star Jesse Lingard was peppered with bank notes by West Ham fans on his home debut for Nottingham Forest. The England international joined Premier League new boys Forest after leaving Old Trafford this summer, and played the full 90 minutes of their opening weekend defeat to Newcastle. Lingard retained a spot in Steve Cooper's starting XI for the West Ham game, which marked his 300th appearance in the English top-flight, but the Hammers faithful did their best to try and ruin the occasion for the midfielder. Notes thrown at Lingard .. pic.twitter.com/gFjEWBnwrl After leaving United this summer on a free transfer, Lingard was on the lookout for a new challenge.  Reports linked the midfielder to a whole host of clubs throughout Europe including Newcastle, Roma and West Ham. Lingard spent six months on loan with the Hammers in 2021, scoring nine goals and propelling them toward the Europa League. Lingard ultimately chose to join Premier League newcomers Nottingham Forest, where he is reportedly earning in excess of £200,000 a week. Many West Ham fans are furious, and believe he followed the money rather than join their club. Lingard got the last laugh on his tormentors, with Forest running out 1-0 winners at the City Ground. The midfielder even played a significant role in his side's winner, albeit not deliberately.  Fellow summer arrival Harry Toffolo found Lingard unmarked in the box after a driving run, but the former United man scuffed his effort. Fortunately, Ben Johnson cleared his shot into Taiwo Awoniyi, who diverted it into the back of the net.  West Ham had enough chances to draw level, striking the bar twice and seeing a penalty saved by Dean Henderson, but it would be Lingard's Forest who held on for their first Premier League win of the season.

6937,‘We always wanted the best for each other’ - Chelsea duo Reece & Lauren James aiming to become first brother & sister to win FA Cup,"Reece and Lauren James could become the first brother and sister to win the FA Cup this weekend, as both prepare to represent Chelsea in a double-header of finals at Wembley. Reece is first up on Saturday as Thomas Tuchel’s side take on Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool, a team that beat them in a very close Carabao Cup final earlier this season which was decided by penalties. Lauren will then be involved on Sunday afternoon as Emma Hayes’ Chelsea go for another league and cup double, having won the Women’s Super League on Sunday. They too are seeking revenge, with opponents Manchester City having beaten them in the Continental Cup final back in March. Ahead of the games this weekend, the pair spoke to reporters about what it was like growing up together as two aspiring footballers and how that helped them. “It's definitely not going to make us worse,” Reece said. “I think every brother and sister would kind of have that competitive edge. “We always wanted the best for each other and the best for ourselves and I think that drove us both to where we are today.” Their father, Nigel, a football coach, has had a huge impact on both as well. “He's played a big part with coaching us alongside the clubs and giving us guidance, keeping us grounded and stuff, so we stayed focused,” Lauren explained. “I think he definitely had a big influence on where we are today,” Reece added. “He's definitely proud of both of us representing Chelsea. “Growing up, we both supported Chelsea so to represent them now is obviously a great feeling as well. We've both put in a lot of hard work, in football and away from football, to get to where we are.” That positive motivation from within the family and the drive that each player has means they are on the cusp of history this weekend, in an FA Cup double-header. Lauren has won this competition before with Chelsea back in December's delayed final, but has yet to make an appearance at Wembley. Reece, meanwhile, has played on the famous pitch but has not got his hands on this trophy, twice being a runner-up. “We’re both looking forward to it,” Reece said. “Our aim is to win both trophies. She'll be supporting me and, likewise, I'll be supporting her. “It's obviously a great piece of history to [potentially] have. I think we need to take it one step at a time and win the first game and hopefully, [the women] win as well.” “Obviously, it's a big occasion at Wembley but I just have to look at it like another game,” Lauren added, ahead of potentially making her debut at the iconic stadium. “It will be a special moment – hopefully [with us] winning.” Both players also spoke about what it has been like competing at the highest level amid lots of noise off the pitch, with the change of ownership and sanctions on the club. “If you let things distract you, then it can show on the pitch,” Lauren said. “I think we have a good group to not allow those distractions [to happen], which is helping us keep focus.” Reece echoed those thoughts on the men’s side. “Everyone's aware of what's happening, but no one really listens,” he said. “Our job is to play football. “What happens with the club, with the owners and stuff, is not really up to us. Our job is to perform on the pitch and come in and train every day.” “The aim is always to win trophies,” Lauren added. “I think everyone around just cracks on with their day-to-day and takes each game as it comes. Hopefully we can win another trophy.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-reece-lauren-james-first-brother-sister-win-fa-cup/blt3c2701f6cb9efa77,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1363,Espanyol respond to Arsenal's De Tomas transfer interest amid €75m striker links on deadline day,"Arsenal have asked about the possible availability of Raul de Tomas on transfer deadline day, but have been informed by Espanyol that the Spain international striker is not for sale. The Gunners are leaving it late in the winter window to try and get more firepower into their ranks, with Mikel Arteta needing to counter the possible departure of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The Gabon international has been frozen out at Emirates Stadium since December, but cover for him will still be required if a loan agreement with Barcelona is pushed through. Several targets have been mooted for Arsenal as they look to cover the loss of Aubameyang, who is in Spain to put the finishing touches to a Camp Nou switch. Ex-Real Madrid forward De Tomas has emerged as a top target, with the 27-year-old hitting 23 goals last season and 11 in the current campaign, but Espanyol chairman Jose Maria Duran told Sport3 of being contacted by the Gunners: “Yes, it was a one-time call, but we hardly wanted to listen. “Our position is clear. We will not let Raul de Tomas go, especially not in the middle of the season.” There were suggestions that Espanyol’s resolve to retain the services of a prized asset could be tested if a supposed release clause in his contract were to be triggered. Various reports have speculated on the proven frontman being available to any suitor willing to pay €70 million (£58m/$78m), with De Tomas tied to a contract in Catalunya through to 2026. Duran has admitted to the existence of a clause, but claims it is higher than originally stated in the striker’s terms and is not a price that Espanyol are willing to do business at. He added: “Raul no longer has a clause of 70 million, but due to inflation it is almost 75. Prices go up, but so do our defences.” Arsenal will now need to turn their attention elsewhere, with De Tomas another option set to fall out of their reach. They had been keen on prolific Serbian forward Dusan Vlahovic prior to seeing him complete a €75m (£62m/$84m) move from Fiorentina to Juventus. Alexander Isak of Real Sociedad and Lille star Jonathan David have also been linked with the Gunners but no deals have been put in place. That is likely to mean that Eddie Nketiah will see out the winter window in north London, with the England U21 international set to be retained by Arsenal despite attracting plenty of interest as his contract runs down.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/espanyol-arsenal-de-tomas-transfer-interest-eur75m-striker-links-/blta65e0121ff671c5c,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7412,Man Utd star Pogba makes surprise pick for hardest Premier League opponent,"Paul Pogba is a World Cup winner with France and was once the most expensive player on the planet, but has made a surprise selection for the toughest opponent he has come up against. Pogba has lined up against some of the finest talent on the planet over the course of a distinguished career that has seen spells at Old Trafford and Juventus as well as 89 appearances for Les Bleus. He is a big fan of fellow countryman N’Golo Kante, who remains a direct rival at club level with Chelsea, but he considers Germany international Emre Can – now at Borussia Dortmund after previously turning out for Liverpool and Juve – to be his most fearsome foe. Asked by Joe to pick out his toughest Premier League opponent, Pogba said: “Emre Can, yeah. Obviously, N'Golo and everything, but one day I remember I had a big battle with Emre Can. ""With Kante, you pass him and you think there’s another N'Golo because he comes back so fast.” While Can has posed Pogba problems in the past, the Frenchman has never ended up on the losing side against his German rival. The pair have lined up on opposing sides in five fixtures, with some memorable tussles taking place. Pogba has tended to come out on top and still boasts an unbeaten record.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-pogba-hardest-premier-league-opponent/blt6f956153554813a2,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2774,The kings of sh*thousing: How Simeone and Atletico Madrid became the masters of football’s dark arts,"Manchester City can consider themselves warned. When they face Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals over the next fortnight, they will be fighting two battles. The first is football’s technical side. That is the easier one, the part that City will back themselves to win, even though Atletico boast impressive players like Joao Felix and Jan Oblak. The second is something more nebulous, more intangible, an intense battle of mentality, pressure and provocation. Of marginal gains, obtaining small edges wherever possible. Atletico Madrid are the masters of ‘sh*thousing’, which is not just a way of winding up opponents and their supporters, but a key pillar of the club’s hopes of European glory. ""I don't know if the game went more than two minutes without being interrupted with someone lying on the floor,” complained Manchester United coach Ralf Rangnick, after his team were beaten 1-0 at Old Trafford by Atletico in the last 16, and eliminated 2-1 on aggregate. Man City, then, would do well to learn from their neighbours’ defeat, where Atletico put on a classic display of ‘sh*thousery’ to frustrate Rangnick’s side and stop them from finding a rhythm, all while winding the clock down. Atletico tumbled easily, winning soft fouls, and broke up the game by exaggerating injuries. “Every time you touch them, they go down and it's a foul,” grumbled Harry Maguire. Furious United fans threw bottles at Simeone as he raced towards the tunnel at full-time, left raging by what they had seen, although that was no excuse for their actions. Liverpool suffered the same fate in 2020, with left-back Andy Robertson complaining: “They started falling over and trying to get under our skin.” Former England and Man City midfielder Trevor Sinclair was left enraged by Atletico at the time, as Liverpool were knocked out. “I played against Simeone in the World Cup and he was a horrible man to play against,” he explained. “Atletico Madrid have got some great talented players, so to use the dark arts I think is wrong. “For me, deliberate handballs, pulling shirts, cynical deliberate fouls, diving, these are all things I don’t want to see in the game. “We call it the beautiful game for a reason, football is supposed to be beautiful to watch. But this is absolute rubbish, I don’t like seeing it.” Atletico are viewed as the kings of the dark arts in England, though their fans might argue that over the past few years, the team has not indulged in them enough. The Manchester United match was a throwback to the days of the two Diegos - Costa and Godin - both experts in the underhand. In 2014, it was easier for Simeone to get away with it, with his team truly the underdogs, scrapping against giants Barcelona and Real Madrid, and eventually going on to win the Spanish title for the first time in 18 years, at Camp Nou with a 1-1 draw on the last day of the season. Given how disadvantaged Atletico were financially, compared to Madrid and Barca, Simeone had to make every edge count. The way to compete with the elite was to stop them by any means necessary, to scrap and to spoil. Atletico leaned on the club’s values of hard work, courage and heart, to get his players to do anything for the communal cause, crossing lines or not. In the years since, Atletico have grown and brought in a lot of quality attacking stars, from Felix to Matheus Cunha, Antoine Griezmann to Luis Suarez. The onus has been on them to attack more and, with Suarez - admittedly no stranger to sh*thousery himself - up front, they won the title again last season, with a more attractive style of football. For Atletico’s dark arts to work most efficiently, the team also needs to try and frustrate their opponents tactically, leaving little space at the back and shutting up shop after snatching an early lead, adding to their rising anger. Perhaps because many consider Atletico to have the strongest squad in La Liga, they have not felt as comfortable playing in the same fashion domestically, but in Europe, Simeone and his players have reverted to type. “Simeone recovers pure Cholismo,” ran a recent headline in Diario Sport, referring to the style of play and attitude his 2014 team were known for. “Cholismo takes Old Trafford,” noted El Pais. Atletico have never won the Champions League and it is easy for Simeone to foster an us-against-the-world mentality, making Atletico the underdogs again, which they have not been on home soil. “I see a competitive side, one that doesn't feel ashamed to drop deep,” noted Simeone recently, with his players sliding into their more defensive shell again after months of their back-line being uncharacteristically all at sea. Against Porto in the last game of the Champions League group phase, they pulled out all their tricks to snatch a 3-1 win at the Estadio do Dragao and progress. After Yannick Carrasco was sent off - giving Atletico full license to go backs-against-the-wall - they started haranguing the officials and winding up Porto players. Wendell was immediately sucked in like a moth to light and raised an arm to Cunha, who went down like a sack of bricks, with referee Clement Turpin brandishing the red card. A 42-man brawl ensued and Porto’s heads had gone by the end of it, with Atletico thriving in the chaos. Whether you approve of Simeone’s tactics or not, it’s undoubtedly impressive that he can get the current squad implicated in them, after so much turnover. Felix, for example, arrived all skilful touches and soft-edges in 2019, but in February 2021 was spotted screaming, “Shut your f*cking mouth!” at the coach. The Portugal international has burst into spectacular form recently, hardened by Simeone’s tutelage while becoming more lethal in front of goal, netting twice in the 4-1 win over Alaves on Saturday. “I love it when players rebel,” said Simeone of Felix’s outburst, the coach clearly keen on shaping a team in his image. Many people’s first memories of Simeone will be his play-acting, and the role he played in getting David Beckham sent off at the 1998 World Cup, by ruffling his hair and then overreacting to his opponent’s angry response. Sh*thousing, but with a purpose. No longer able to do it himself on the pitch, Simeone is the conductor on the sidelines, dressed all in black like a malignant presence, constantly urging his team onwards, if not always forwards. Liverpool, earlier in the group stage, showed what is needed to overcome Atletico - although Simeone’s side were not fighting for their lives at that point. They needed some luck, with a referee who was not having any of Atletico’s misbehaviour in Dutchman Danny Makkelie, but also played with such intensity and gusto that even the Rojiblancos could not upset the apple cart.  Jurgen Klopp also paid attention to Atletico players trying to get under Sadio Mane’s skin and subbed the Senegal winger, who was on a booking, earlier than he might have otherwise. Manchester City are no strangers to tactical fouls themselves, although Guardiola will need to prime his players for everything else that comes with Atletico’s visit to the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday, and then the trip to the Wanda Metropolitano on April 13. That will be crucial, especially given how City’s failings in Europe have often come down to mentality, caving under pressure and losing against lesser opponents, including Lyon, Tottenham and Monaco. Guardiola has suffered it first-hand, with Atletico knocking out his Bayern Munich side in the 2016 semi-finals, the Spanish coach rowing with his Argentine counterpart on the touchline. Pep may ever remember a clash in his playing days with Atletico, where Simeone turned him brilliantly, also completing a double nutmeg on Guardiola’s Barcelona team-mate Jose Mari Bakero, and cheekily applauded himself afterwards before continuing the move. Love it or hate it, that is the game Atletico Madrid will play. City need to be able to handle it if they are to progress.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/kings-shthousing-simeone-atletico-madrid-masters-dark-arts/bltb636f9f34122999f,Rik Sharma,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

5518,Matthaus chides 'disrespectful' Bayern over stalled Lewandowski renewal,"Ex-Bayern Munich great Lothar Matthaus slammed his former club for showing ""disrespect"" in failing to open contract talks with Robert Lewandowski. Lewandowski, 33, has become one of the greatest goalscorers in Bayern history since moving from Borussia Dortmund in 2014.  But his current deal expires in 2023 and the Bundesliga giants are reportedly yet to make an offer to their star.  ""If you haven't contacted Lewandowski's side up to now, I find that disrespectful,"" Matthaus fired to Sport Bild.  ""That would have been unthinkable under Uli Hoeness or Kalle Rummenigge. ""Bayern can count themselves lucky that Robert Lewandowski has such a great character and is a full professional. He won't let go. “I am surprised that nothing is progressing. You shouldn't put everything in the drawer and wait and see."" The Poland international is enjoying another memorable season at the head of Bayern's forward line.  Having smashed 48 goals in 40 appearances last term, he already looks set to surpass that mark with 43 in 36 in 2021-22.  Bayern, meanwhile, are on course for a record 10th consecutive Bundesliga crown, while they have also booked their place in the Champions League last eight after destroying Salzburg 8-2 on aggregate in the previous round.

2486,Ivorian midfielder Kessie on target as Milan thrash Sassuolo to win Serie A title after 11-year wait,"Franck Kessie was on target as AC Milan ended their 11-year wait for a Serie A title with a 3-0 thrashing of Sassuolo on Sunday. Milan came into the match requiring just a draw to fend off cross-town rivals Inter Milan, who were two points behind, but wasted no time when French striker Olivier Giroud gave them a 2-0 lead after 32 minutes. Stefano Pioli’s side continued to pour forward in a dominant first half display, and the irresistible Rafael Leao set up Kessie, whose fine left-footed finish extended the advantage to 3-0 in the 36th minute. The goal secured the points for Milan who controlled the second half with Kessie involved in most of the Rossoneri’s build-up play while acting as a foil for the defence. The Ivory Coast international midfielder, who has formed an unbreakable partnership with Sandro Tonali, put in a great shift once more as he ended the game with a 93 per cent pass completion rate, while managing two shots and also winning one tackle. 📊| Franck Kessié in his last match for Milan.• 1 Goal• 51 Touches• 38/41 Passes• 4/6 Long Balls• 2 Chances Created (1 Big)• 0 Times Dispossessed• 4/7 Duels Won• 1 Tackle• 1 Interception• 4 Ball Recoveries• 2 Fouls Won🏆 Serie A Winner🇨🇮🔜🔵🔴 pic.twitter.com/cN1QoMZUJu Sunday’s goal was Kessie’s sixth of the season and he ends the campaign with the league winner’s medal before he departs to Barcelona after running down a contract offer. Kessie was not the only African celebrating league success with the Rossoneri, Algerian international Ismael Bennacer also played a part after coming on in the second half while Mali defender Fode Ballo-Toure was an unused substitute. Bennacer, who started the season as Kessie’s midfield partner, has lost his place to Tonali in the second half of the season and will hope to regain it 2022-23 with the Ivorian gone. Meanwhile, outgoing champions Inter had to settle for second place despite a 3-0 victory over Sampdoria thanks to a brace from Joaquin Correa and a strike from Ivan Perisic. Inter had hoped that victory over Sampdoria coupled with defeat for Milan would see them retain the Scudetto but that was not to be as they finished the campaign with 84 points, two behind Pioli’s men. Napoli, who were already assured of the third position, finished the season with 79 points following a 3-0 win over Spezia while Juventus, who lost 2-0 to Fiorentina on Saturday, clinched the final Champions League qualification spot. Rome rivals Lazio and AS Roma will play Europe League football next season while Fiorentina will be in the third tier Conference League after finishing seventh. It has been a poor Serie A campaign for Atalanta, who finished in a disappointing eighth place for a team that managed back-to-back top-four finishes, while Genoa and Venezia were already relegated before Sunday’s matches.

4401,Chelsea boss Tuchel explains starting Havertz over Lukaku as Blues rely on distinct qualities,"Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has explained his reliance on Kai Havertz over Romelu Lukaku in a detailed statement on the unique qualities Havertz offers. Havertz has started four of the Blues' past five matches while Lukaku has received just two nods over that timeframe. On Saturday, Havertz scored two goals in a 4-0 win over Burnley. Lukaku did not appear in the game. “Of course [it's hard to leave out Havertz],” Tuchel said to reporters. “He gives a lot of intensity and he’s involved in goals. He scored again, so it’s a very good moment and it’s on him to keep going. This is how it is. “We played the last cup match without him, Timo Werner was very strong and was very close to starting. Romelu got his goal and we will need everybody. But at this moment, [Havertz is] in really good shape. “What he gives us is huge volume. He covers a lot of metres, he covers a lot of metres in high intensity, so he finds the intensity no matter what the system the opponent defends against us, he finds intensive runs, he finds distances. “This is what makes him and he uses his body more and more. “He loves to create overloads and half spaces and this is what he gives. It’s just his style of play, his characteristic as a player. He’s in good shape, he’s confident."" Tuchel has many attacking options at his disposal, but most of them have run hot-and-cold over his tenure. There was a time when Havertz struggled to consistently get into the starting line-up, though for the time being, that's no longer the case. Lukaku, meanwhile, has taken a back seat after a turbulent start to the campaign that featured more controversy than production, and he must now prove to Tuchel that he belongs as a first-choice forward.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-boss-tuchel-explains-starting-havertz-over-lukaku-as/blt1b749e0e092b97a8,Dan Bernstein,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

3290,Pulisic scores 90th minute winner for Chelsea vs West Ham after USMNT star is subbed on in second half,"Christian Pulisic made a vital intervention for Chelsea on Sunday by scoring a last-minute winning goal against West Ham. The United States international came off the bench to replace Timo Werner in the 76th minute of the Premier League clash. The substitution proved crucial for the Blues in the end, as he went on to fire in the goal that secured three points for his side. The London sides seemed to be heading for a 0-0 draw at Stamford Bridge until the late stages of the game. Chelsea were given a boost in the 86th minute when Craig Dawson was shown a red card for a foul on Lukaku, resulting in a penalty kick for the home team. But Jorginho failed to convert the spot kick, sending it straight into the arms of goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. Just as a draw seemed inevitable, Pulisic stepped up to make the difference when a pass from Marcos Alonso found him in space and he was able to fire into the net. The result keeps Chelsea in third place in the Premier League with six games to play. They are five points clear of fourth-placed Arsenal, with Tottenham a further two behind. Meanwhile, title contenders Liverpool are 11 points ahead of Thomas Tuchel's team before their clash with Everton on Sunday.

New manager Erik ten Hag had already lost the first match of his tenure last weekend, and any optimism from the pre-season is now a distant memory.

Then, Mathias Jensen managed to double his side's lead eight minutes later. Ben Mee and Bryan Mbeumo compounded United's misery with a goal each to make it 4-0 by half-time, which was followed by a goalless second period.

4106,Messi for life! Barcelona presidential candidate reveals Michael Jordan-style deal he planned for star,"Barcelona saw Lionel Messi join Paris Saint-Germain as a free agent in 2021 after failing to find the funds required to put a new contract in place, but Victor Font says things would have been different had he beaten Joan Laporta in the club’s presidential election. A familiar face was returned to office at Camp Nou, but Font claims that he would have delivered a “lifetime agreement” with the Argentine superstar and developed a brand similar to that which keeps NBA legend Michael Jordan relevant long after his playing days ended. Font claims he would have managed mounting debts in Catalunya, allowing the services of the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner to be retained while creating ties between player and club that would never have been broken. Messi bid a tearful farewell to Barca once it became apparent Laporta and co could not deliver fresh terms within strict budgets, but Font claims he would have got a deal over the line. He told La Vanguardia: “Our plan to save Messi was different - reduce salary mass and losses the first year and propose a lifetime agreement. “The other day I read that the Jordan brand developed at Nike has exceeded $5 billion in revenue this year.

10603,Arsenal vs Tottenham: Prediction and Preview,"The first north London derby of the season is here and both sides come into it in red hot form. We look ahead to the game with our data-powered Arsenal vs Tottenham prediction and preview. Fresh off the back of playing their first Champions League game in over six years, Arsenal host rivals Tottenham at the Emirates Stadium this weekend. Both sides come into this game with unbeaten Premier League records (W4 D1), and Spurs (2nd) sit two places above Arsenal (4th) on goal difference alone. Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool are sandwiched by the two teams in third, with Manchester City out in front at the top. Both teams’ fast starts mean this will be the first Premier League north London derby with both Arsenal and Tottenham unbeaten coming into the match. Going further back, it’s just the third NLD in league history that both clubs come into the game with an unbeaten record, and the first since 1990. Arsenal have had the better of this clash in recent years, winning both of their league meetings last season, and the Gunners have won four out of the last five Premier League fixtures between these two sides. Mikel Arteta has a perfect 3/3 record in home league meetings against Spurs and should he win again on Sunday, he’d become just the second manager – after Terry Neill between 1977 and 1980 – to win each of his first four home north London derby matches in charge of Arsenal. They come into this fixture on a high after comfortably breezing past PSV Eindhoven 4-0 to celebrate their Champions League return. It was notable how potent Arsenal looked playing against a team that tried to engage them high up the pitch, given that is the way Ange Postecoglu demands his teams play. Now, granted, Spurs have a higher calibre of player than PSV, but the joy that Arsenal got through central areas, particularly via the electric Martin Ødegaard, should stand them in good stead ahead of the derby. Tottenham Hotspur had to work extremely hard for their latest win – a 2-1 success over Sheffield United last time out – as two late goals from Richarlison and Dejan Kulusevski saw them pull off the latest winning comeback in Premier League history. Still, that late win maintained their unbeaten start to kick off the season and saw them score 2+ goals again in a Premier League game. Ange Postecoglou is now the fifth manager to see his side score 2+ goals in each of his first five matches in the competition (after Carlo Ancelotti, Pep Guardiola, Craig Shakespeare (yes!) and Maurizio Sarri). Of the previous four, only Sarri’s Chelsea failed to score at least twice in the sixth game. We have, of course, been here before with Tottenham. Antonio Conte guided his Spurs side to an unbeaten start after five matches (W3 D2) last season, but their campaign eventually imploded and they finished eighth. But even if Spurs’ unbeaten run does come to an end here, the feeling around the club is very, very different from 12 months ago. Bukayo Saka has been in sparkling form for Arsenal. The English winger has been involved in 18 goals in his last 18 Premier League home appearances (12 goals, six assists), either scoring (2) or assisting (1) in all three of his league games at the Emirates Stadium this season. Arsenal’s starlet grabbed a goal and an assist against PSV on Wednesday night, after setting up Leandro Trossard’s winner at Everton. David Raya was again preferred in goal over incumbent Aaron Ramsdale in midweek. The Brentford loanee has now started Arsenal’s last two matches, and his ability with the ball at his feet – particularly his passing accuracy over long distances – gives Arsenal a different weapon in their build-up game. 840m – David Raya's successful upfield passes covered a distance of 840 metres against PSV, the highest of any player in the Champions League on MD1. The next highest goalkeeper ranked ninth (Anthony Racioppi, 613 metres).840m – David Raya (GK)716m – Dayot Upamecano (CB)712m… pic.twitter.com/ppalI6Gh0A Gabriel Martinelli is a doubt for this game with a hamstring strain he picked up against Everton at Goodison Park last weekend. It could hand another opportunity for Trossard to start. Earlier in the week, we made the case that the Belgian has done more than enough in his limited playing time so far to justify a starting lineup spot, and maybe the Martinelli injury opens the door for him. Thomas Partey is still a doubt. Arsenal will be happy to see the back of Bayern Munich’s Harry Kane in this fixture – who scored 14 goals in 17 Premier League appearances against the Gunners, but they might have to deal with a revitalised Richarlison. The Brazilian’s cameo against Sheffield United would have been very welcome to those in Tottenham’s half of north London. His equaliser was just his second ever Premier League strike for Spurs in what was his 32nd appearance. Son Heung-Min led the line from the start in that game and will probably do the same again at the weekend, but a rejuvenated Richarlison could be a damaging option off the bench. Spurs were dealt a big blow in training this week as experienced Croatian Ivan Perisic suffered an ACL injury in non-contact training. He will now join Rodrigo Bentancur (knee), Ryan Sessegnon (hamstring), Bryan Gil (groin), and Giovani Lo Celso (quad) as those who will miss this game. This Sunday will be the 194th north London derby in history. Arsenal lead the bragging rights overall (81-51-61). They’ve also had the better of this fixture in recent memory. After winning both of their league meetings against Spurs last season, the Gunners are looking to win three straight league games against their north London rivals for the first time in over 30 years (five in a row between 1987-89). The fact this game takes place at the Emirates should give Arsenal fans even more confidence. Remarkably, Tottenham have won just one of their last 30 Premier League away games against Arsenal (D11 L18), and are winless in 12 (D4 L8) since a 3-2 victory in November 2010. So far the only blemish on Arsenal’s start to the season has been a frustrating 2-2 draw at home to Fulham, a game that they really ought to have won based on the quality of chances they created. Still, with wins over Nottingham Forest, Crystal Palace, Manchester United and Everton, they are unbeaten to start the season and sit just two points behind leaders Manchester City. Wednesday night gave Mikel Arteta his first taste of Champions League action, and the games come thick and fast for the Gunners. They’re scheduled to play five in just two weeks across three different competitions before the international break. It’s a congested spell that ends in a Premier League showdown against Man City. With 13 points through five matches, Spurs are off to their best start in Premier League history. To put that achievement into context, it’s their best points return after five games since 1965-66 (also 13), and they’ve only had a better start to a top-flight campaign once in their history, back in 1960-61, when they started with five wins from five. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta supercomputer is predicting an Arsenal win in this match, giving them a 47.6% of doing so at the weekend. Historically, home advantage has been crucial in this fixture and given Spurs’ terrible away record at the Emirates, the 25.7% they’re given for taking all three points might appear generous. But it’s a new era at Tottenham and now might be time to finally shift that narrative. A draw has a 26.7% likelihood. Looking at the latest Opta supercomputer predictions for the 2023-24 Premier League season, Arsenal win the title in just 2.0% of the 10,000 simulations. That makes them the model’s third favourites, behind Man City (91.1%) and Liverpool (6.6%). Tottenham win the league in just 0.1% of the simulations. Qualifying for a UEFA Champions League spot is far more likely for the Gunners (82.0%) while Spurs qualify in 31.4% of simulations. Enjoy this?

2537,Man Utd & Arsenal-linked Kamara joins Aston Villa on free transfer after leaving Marseille,"Boubacar Kamara has signed for Aston Villa on a five-year contract after leaving Marseille, with the Premier League club winning the race for a midfielder that had also been strongly linked with Manchester United and Arsenal. Kamara attracted interest from the Premier League during an impressive 2021-22 campaign at Marseille, who he helped finish second in Ligue 1 to qualify for the Champions League. The 22-year-old left Stade Velodrome after their final game of the season against Strasbourg, having decided against extending his contract, and will now continue his development in England with Villa. Villa have confirmed Kamara's arrival on a free transfer, with the Frenchman committing to a deal that will keep him on their books until 2027. Meanwhile, head coach Steven Gerrard has expressed his delight after sealing his first new signing of the summer. “I am delighted that we have been able to attract one of the most promising young talents in European football,"" Gerrard told the club's media. ""We have a very clear plan to make our team stronger and Bouba is an important part of that.” Aston Villa is delighted to announce the signing of @BoubaKamara_4 on a five-year contract! ✅ Kamara will provide extra competition in the Villa midfield alongside the likes of Douglas Luiz and John McGinn as they seek to push for a European spot in 2022-23. The former Marseille star thrived in a holding role at Stade Velodrome, appearing in 170 games across all competitions after initially breaking into their senior squad in 2016. Kamara is also capable of contributing in the final third as he managed to record four goals and six assists for Marseille, and his chances of earning a place in the France national team could be boosted now that he is taking on a new challenge in the Premier League.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-arsenal-linked-kamara-free-transfer-aston-villa-five/blt5b34981c894c3552,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

1526,Ramos: I would like to play four or five more years,"Sergio Ramos hopes to continue playing at football's top level for up to five more years. The 35-year-old joined Paris Saint-Germain from Real Madrid last summer after his contract with the Spanish giants expired. But the Spain international's time in France has been plagued by injury, limiting him to to just seven appearances in all competitions this season. Ramos' issues have sparked suggestions he could leave PSG after just one season at the club, but he insists he wants to see out his contract with the organisation and spend even more time playing in a top league. ""I would like to play between four and five more years at the top level and then live another experience,"" the centre-back told Amazon Prime. ""I have two years at PSG, we will try to do three and then we'll see. As long as my physical condition holds up, I think I can keep my mind focused. ""I prefer to play in the best team in the world than to be the best player because in the end football is a collective sport and it is about winning as a team.  ""Before being the best in the world, I prefer to play world championships, Champions League. And for everything, you always need the work of the team."" Ramos made his sixth Ligue 1 appearance on Saturday when they beat Clermont 6-1. It is the first time he has completed the full 90 minutes for PSG since January 23, when they beat Reims 4-0. Since then, the defender had been out of action with a calf injury. Earlier in the season he had been kept out by a previous calf injury and another muscle issue.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ramos-i-would-like-to-play-four-or-five-more-years/blt03aec56823bf3639,By Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5386,Who is Jonathan Clauss? The Lens right-back who's gone from packing sausages to the France squad,"As Didier Deschamps prepared to name his latest France squad last week, Lens’ players sat Jonathan Clauss in front of the TV. They’d been waiting impatiently for the announcement. They knew what was going to happen. Clauss didn’t, though. He didn’t dare dream that he might receive a call-up. Even when his name was mentioned, and his delighted team-mates lined up to congratulate him, he still couldn’t quite believe him. It’s easy to understand why. After all, just five years ago he was distributing flyers for a living; becoming a professional footballer seemed ludicrous.  Now, though, he is going to play alongside world champions. If a feel-good fairy tale is still possible in modern football, then this is it. Clauss climbed the ladder slowly, proving something to himself with each step. In the beginning, after getting discarded from Strasbourg academy at the age of 17 for being too weak and thin, Clauss was heartbroken, and the fact that his parents got divorced at the very same time didn't help in the slightest. He didn’t believe there was a future for him in the pro ranks, so he decided to just continue playing for fun at amateur level, while studying sport science and taking on a number of jobs, including packing sausages at a butcher's shop and doing night shifts at a postal sorting centre. He was eventually picked up by German sixth division outfit but Clauss’ self-belief remained deeply affected by his Strasbourg rejection. 🎶 Ce rêve bleu... @Djoninho25 n'y croit pas, c'est merveilleux 😍🎶#SiFierDEtreLensois pic.twitter.com/kKsh3ePuna ""I had confidence in my feet, I had confidence in my head, but I had no confidence in my body at all,” he told Ligue 1’s official website. “The physical impact scared me. I had problems with big guys coming at me at a crazy speed. As a result, I was timid in certain matches.” There was another thing holding him back: the professional lifestyle didn't interest him at all.  Clauss liked to party. He often went to the pub the night before a game and more often than not came late for training sessions – that even became his trademark, as coaches cynically complimented him if he happened to arrive on time. His bosses invariably still liked him because of his footballing qualities and positive attitude, though. Clauss was mainly responsible for music and good atmosphere in the dressing room. He might be from the German-influenced Alsace region, but a Brazilian at heart, as choosing the nickname Djoninho would suggest. It is also a nod towards Lyon's legendary dead ball maestro Juninho, as Clauss loved to take free kicks himself.  He was also technically superior to his team-mates in several areas and Linx manager was so impressed with his natural ability that he even arranged him trials at Hoffenheim, but the full-back was 22 at the time, and the Bundesliga outfit considered him to be way too old to invest in. Something started to change in 2015 when Clauss signed for fifth division Raon-l'Etape, where he came in contact with Bruno Paterno, a strict, old-school coach who tried and partially succeeded to curb Clauss’ off-field activity. In addition, he was lucky to face St Etienne in the French Cup, playing against a Ligue 1 team for the first time at the age of 23, and even scoring a nice goal with his head.  The underdogs lost on penalties, but 120 decent minutes against top opponents attracted scouts, and Clauss was signed by third division Avranches in 2016. There, fate arranged for him not one but three exciting French Cup fixtures.  For starters, he scored an astonishingly good goal against Laval, and his name was mentioned across the country for the first time. Then, Avranches managed to beat Strasbourg on penalties, in a very emotional personal revenge.  Finally, he got the chance to face the superstars of Paris Saint-Germain, on a truly surreal occasion for a guy who used to sort packages.  Coincidentally, Christopher Nkunku, who was also called up for the first time by Deschamps last week, was one of his opponents that night. On the back of his obvious improvement and undoubted potential, Clauss signed for Quevilly Rouen, newly promoted to Ligue 2 in 2017, signing his first professional contract at the age of 24.  The team was relegated, but he was one of the best performers in the division, and decided to leave in order to continue the progress. That was easier said than done, though. The summer of 2018 proved to be dramatic in the extreme. Clauss' agents claimed that Serie B side Verona were interested in him, but that proved to be wrong.  Arminia Bielefeld considered signing him, but eventually preferred a much more experienced Swiss defender Cedric Brunner. Then, the strange option in Belarus came by. Dinamo Brest, who had just bizarrely appointed Diego Maradona as their new chairman, called, because their new coach Aleksey Shplivesky's father worked as an agent in Germany and heard about Clauss.  The negotiations went smoothly, and the possibility of meeting Maradona appealed to the Frenchman, but the deal fell through because Shpilevsky abruptly left following a fight with the board. That is when Clauss decided to give up. He came back to his mother, told her that he had quit football and refused to answer phone calls.  When finally persuaded to pick up the phone, he heard amazing news. Brunner got injured, and Bielefeld wanted him after all.  It turned out that missing out on Belarus was a huge slice of luck, and Clauss made his debut in the German second division at Hamburg.  ""I went from nothing to playing in front of 60,000 fans,"" he said. That is where the rise became much faster. Clauss' first season at Bielefeld was decent, but the second was superb, as he helped them to promotion.  After his contract ended, he moved to Lens on a free transfer in 2020, and finally – at the age of 28 – played in the top flight for the first time in his life. Soon, he was one of the best performers in Ligue 1 in his position. Disciplined, quick, technically sound, and extremely attack-minded like his idol Dani Alves – Clauss took the division by storm.  He is not afraid of tackles anymore, but believes that the higher level of partners and opponents makes life easier.  ""Paradoxically, I had more apprehension when I played at a lower level. The lower divisions seem to me more complicated to approach,"" he says. Not long after his belated arrival in Ligue 1, a hashtag was invented, demanding he be called up by the national team.  The #ClaussEnEDF campaign lasted almost a year, but the player himself refused to take part in it, or even pay it much attention. He was more amused by it than anything else. ""We obviously want him to play for France, but he doesn't believe it. He says it's not for him,"" his mother said. Well, it turns out that it is for him. When Clauss makes his national team debut, every amateur footballer around the world will identify with him.  How many of them could be top stars but wasted their potential? We will never know. But Clauss is evidence that anything is possible with a bit of luck and the right attitude.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/jonathan-clauss-lens-right-back-packing-sausages-to-france/blt67ee3dd10a6eb5a6,Michael Yokhin,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

6475,'It was unfair' - Conte still fuming about Arsenal v Spurs Covid postponement ahead of rearranged derby,"Antonio Conte has insisted ""it was unfair"" that Tottenham's home fixture against Arsenal was postponed due to a Covid-19 request from their rivals ahead of the re-arranged north London derby. The two teams were originally due to meet at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on January 16, but the Gunners asked for the game to be pushed back due to a lack of available personnel. The Gunners saw their request granted despite only having one positive coronavirus case in their squad, which prompted the Premier League to change their rules on postponements, but Conte still harbours some anger about the decision. ""To speak now about what happened in the past is not useful,"" the Spurs boss told a press conference. ""For sure, it was very strange that our game was postponed for covid and Arsenal didn’t have one player with covid. ""We lost a game 3-0 [to Rennes] because Premier League didn’t want to move our game when we had nine or 10 players with covid. ""At that time, it was unfair what happened, but now this is the past and we have to be focused on the present and try to get the best result. ""I think this could be a good chance for us to get three points against their whole team because if we played in January they were without many players because they were committed at the African Cup [of Nations] and injuries. I think football is wonderful. Also this type of game it’s right to play with two teams and all the players available."" Arsenal are currently four points ahead of Tottenham in fourth place and will seal a place in next season's Champions League if they beat their old foes on Thursday. Spurs will be hoping to keep the race for fourth alive, but Conte won't consider the 2021-22 campaign to be a failure if his side end up missing out, given the situation they were in when he joined the club in November. ""I knew very well the situation wasn’t good [when I arrived] and only a crazy person could imagine that with two games to go we’d be in the race for a place in the Champions League,"" said Conte.  ""The club didn’t ask me to go for a place in the Champions League or Europa League. They appointed me to try to improve the situation. ""Now we have to be proud that after a difficult season in many aspects for the club, we’re in this race.

5248,Bizarre Norwich City 'pride wall' containing homophobic slurs slammed by their own LGBTQ+ fan group,"Proud Canaries, the LGBTQ+ fan group of Norwich City, have slammed their own club's attempt to mark Pride Month by unveiling a bizarre mural featuring several homophobic slurs phrases. Norwich unveiled the ""Pride Wall"" at Carrow Road on Wednesday, a piece of art work which contains a large number of homophobic and transphobic slurs with occasional letters blocked out. The wall was then covered by coloured paint, as thrown by Norwich fans and members of staff, with the club proclaiming it to be a ""masterpiece"" while promoting it on social media. The wall has not gone down well with all fans, with many pointing out that it amplifies derogatory terms by giving them greater visibility as part of officially club-sanctioned artwork. The choice of words for the mural has also come into question, with twink, an inoffensive word used within the LGBTQ+ community, censored alongside grossly offensive terminology. There is also confusion over the presence of some obscure and archaic terminology. Primary among these is sea queen, a term used to describe gay men who worked as sailors before the 1960s. Norwich's presentation of the wall on social media has also come into question, with an image of the slurs on the wall - before being covered in coloured paint - posted online. The club also posted a series of videos in which the slurs are clearly visible, before the paint is thrown to complete the mural in its current form. Our statement on the #NCFC #Pridemonth content 🏳️‍🌈⚽️🏳️‍⚧️🔰 pic.twitter.com/gNXnkfYOYC In a statement released on Thursday morning, Proud Canaries said: ""We were asked to take part in the project. The impression given was that the film would record an upbeat occasion with players and fans alike throwing paint rainbows at a concourse wall to create an inclusive graffiti mural while discussing the negative impact of bigotry. ""Had we been briefed on the constantly in-view and in-focus abuse wall concept we would have firmly advised against and deemed it a deal breaker. ""The finished edit is far from positive. Viewers, including those from our community, are subjected to the sight of a lexicon of slurs - regulalrly used to target LGBTQ+ people - for almost the entire duration of the production. That error of judgement was compounded exponentially yesterday with the launch tweet, ironically stating that 'this language is not okay' while platforming it. ""We've asked the club to delete the film in its current form, apologise publicly and work with us, Norwich Pride and the broader fan base to make good.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bizarre-norwich-city-pride-wall-homophobic-slurs-lgbtq/blt06b48ded9510599d,Emma Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11808,The Data Day No 14: Our Rolling Football Blog,"Welcome to The Data Day, our rolling football stats blog for 2021-22, where we try and make sense of what just happened. So the pre-Ralf Rangnick era ended on Thursday evening with Manchester United and Arsenal playing out an entertaining but flawed game that ended 3-2 to the 13-time Premier League champions. That meant that the Rangnick era started today, with Crystal Palace visiting Old Trafford and once again United emerged with three points, but this time with a much more controlled display and with the sort of 1-0 scoreline that delights technicians and thinkers throughout the game. Incoming football managers invariably try and make their teams harder to beat, and against a Crystal Palace side who have caused issues for a number of teams this season – and who won away at Manchester City at the end of October – Rangnick’s side gave up only 0.43 expected goals, the first time they’ve restricted a Premier League opponent to under 0.50 in a game this season. It was also their first clean sheet at Old Trafford since April, ending a run of 15 games without one there. Is this the start of the Theatre of Memes returning to its former Dreams-based identity? It was noticeable and quantifiable that more than 50% of United’s attacking play came down the left flank, with Alex Telles making the most touches followed closely by Fred. The latter man, often a criticised figure under previous managers, was pushed a bit further forward in Michael Carrick’s brief spell in charge of the team and his energy will make him a key figure in the new regime. The fact he scored the only goal of the game only underlines his fresh opportunity under Rangnick. We’re now less than three weeks from Christmas and Fred has as many league goals as Lionel Messi and Harry Kane combined. I know, right. Manchester United’s own xG figure was only 0.90, despite having 16 shots. Half of them were from outside the box, and their final effort from inside the area came at the end of the first half. But it’s always harder to make an instant transformation from an attacking point of view. Restricting Palace to so few opportunities was the aim, and that aim was more than achieved. Fred scoring – and not one of United’s plethora of big-name attackers – just felt right in this context. Man Utd 1-0 Crystal Palace: Ralf makes a winning start at OT thanks to Fred. pic.twitter.com/AK956mp3HP And Rangnick has done something that none of the previous five German managers in the Premier League did in their first match: gone and won the game. Victory is what a club like Manchester United expect; maybe they’ve finally located a man who can build the foundations that success thrives on. The lows have been particularly low for Tottenham this season, but the highs have been high enough to move them two points back of the top four with a game in hand entering mid-December after Sunday’s 3-0 win over Norwich City. Lucas Moura looked fantastic on the ball much of the afternoon, and that was evident early on with his 10th-minute goal. It was his second of 18 in the Premier League to come from outside the penalty area and will be an early contender for Premier League goal of the month. 2 – Lucas Moura's strike for Tottenham was only his second @premierleague goal scored from outside the penalty area, and first since his very first goal in the competition against Fulham in August 2018. Cracker. pic.twitter.com/5YVVfe8wVL Sometimes that’s what it takes to break a 25-match scoring drought with this being his first Premier League goal since February. Heung-Min Son, however, seems drought-resistant. He provided the assist, then sealed the win with a 76th-minute finish for his eighth involvement among Tottenham’s 15 Premier League goals (excludes an own goal). Spurs weren’t as dominant as the 3-0 score may imply with expected goals (Tottenham 1.43-1.33 Norwich) and momentum telling a far more balanced story: It was not a strong finishing day for Norwich’s Teemu Pukki. The best early opportunity was undoubtedly his, and the game may have taken a different trajectory had Pukki been able to take the chance on a clear first-touch strike he put straight at Hugo Lloris. Pukki had another in the 58th minute from the other side, but he miss-hit that and directed it to Adam Idah, whose quick reaction of a touch went wide. As for the other side’s leading striker, Harry Kane missed a manageable 39th-minute chip after being played through with Canaries goalkeeper Tim Krul off his line. Kane did force a strong save from Krul in the second half, but striker has now gone six straight matches without scoring for the second time this season and is underperforming his season expected goals mark by 2.51 after exceeding it the previous seven seasons by at least 2.23. It’s yet to cost his new manager much in the way of points. Antonio Conte is now unbeaten in four Premier League matches to begin his managerial career in north London, to match his earliest success at Chelsea five years ago. But an opposition list of Everton, Leeds, Brentford and Norwich isn’t exactly the division’s elite, and this is still essentially table stakes for the Italian manager when he takes over a top-flight club: For Norwich, it ends a four-match unbeaten run that seemed to be dragging them from what was beginning to feel like certain relegation after a 7-0 defeat to Chelsea in late October. But finishing is a major concern. In addition to Pukki’s misses, the Finnish forward supplied Josh Sargent with a late sitter from six yards, but the American badly missed the chance and wasn’t able to put a shot on target. Their eight goals are worst in the league and well under their Premier League-low 13.9 xG. Perhaps they’ll find inspiration knowing Tottenham sit fifth now, still with a negative goal difference, after not being so numerically different from that a month ago. There might not be as much riding on matches between Manchester United and Arsenal these days, but clearly no-one informed the current players about that. The 10th and final game of this midweek set of fixtures served up a Premier League classic, with goals and incidents that will be replayed upon a range of media platforms for years to come. First up: Arsenal’s opening goal goes straight into the top five craziest goals Our League has seen. The beach ball up at Sunderland, Papiss Cisse’s strike at Stamford Bridge. There are contenders elsewhere, but Emile Smith Rowe striking sweetly into the United goal as David De Gea is curled up like he has just lost Red Light, Green Light is right up there. The goalkeeper had been stood on by team-mate Fred at a corner but broke every code ‘keepers should adhere to by going down in a ball and waiting for the referee to stop play. Martin Atkinson whistled but only once the ball was in the net and not even some presumably fevered VAR action down in Middlesex could alter De Gea’s fate. Sunderland beach ball, sorry but your era of dominance is over United equalised with a now-rare goal from Bruno Fernandes, before the second-half became the Cristiano Ronaldo show. The will-he-press-oh-yes-a-bit-actually forward side-footed the home side in front, and then, after Martin Ødegaard had equalised, struck home a penalty conceded by the previously cock-a-hoop Norwegian. Ronaldo’s first was a landmark 800th career goal, which is an incredibly round number, and also finally took him clear of Kevin Davies in the Premier League. If you scored 20 goals a season for 40 years you’d have 800 goals. Ronaldo is getting on, true, but he’s still only 36. His second – maths fans will be ahead of me here – was his 801st, and given that it keeps United incoming manager Ralf Rangnick in touch with the top four, is arguably more important than his 800th. Incidentally, Rangnick will start this weekend without Michael Carrick, the caretaker boss throwing a minor bombshell at full-time by quitting the club entirely. Just wouldn't have been right for Goal No. 800 to come without three points. pic.twitter.com/FJ0a2rNigw Arsenal can feel frustrated at leaving Old Trafford with zero points. They controlled a lot of the second half, with 69% possession for instance, but without making their occasional forays into the box count. They have now lost more Premier League games against Manchester United (25) than any other side and missed a chance of climbing into fourth place. Even so, whatever happens in the future, they’ll always have that Smith Rowe goal. That was bigger than any result.  Antonio Conte’s first London derby might not be the most acclaimed of the various 53 combinations of London derbies to be played in English top-flight history, but it was a win. That’s more than Tottenham could say for their previous four this season. Spurs’ four capital clashes prior to Thursday’s 2-0 win ended in losses by a 10-1 aggregate, but this came much easier with little threat from a Brentford side who are losing shine as winter kicks in: Conte’s technically off to another top-flight unbeaten run to start his latest managerial spell at a club. He’s never lost in his first three matches managing a first-tier club, though there’s a bit of work to be done to reach his master work of a decade ago in Turin as the man in charge of Juventus’ unbeaten 2011-12 and beyond: Spurs’ goals came in varying fashion: First, from a Sergi Canós own goal following a ball played into the box by Heung-Min Son after a short corner – the fourth Spurs’ corner in the first 12 minutes of the match after managing four or fewer in total in seven of their first 12 matches – and the second from a counter past Spurs managers would have been proud of with Sergio Reguilón breaking up the left and finding Son across the goal for a sitter. For Son, it was his 75th Premier League goal with Tottenham. For Spurs, it marked the second straight match in which they’d gone above two expected goals after going their first 11 without reaching that mark. They’ve also conceded just once in Conte’s three Premier League matches after shipping 16 in their previous seven. As for their star man, Harry Kane went without a goal for the fifth straight game after starting the season goalless in his first six. His best chance came five minutes into the second half after being played through by Oliver Skipp, but he couldn’t finish as Brentford keeperÁlvaro Fernández put himself in a good spot and stayed big to make the save. For Brentford, back-to-back top-flight wins for the first time will have to wait at least eight days – they go to Leeds Sunday and host Watford a week on Friday – but there wasn’t much evidence of the brave early-season efforts tonight. Their 0.41 xG mark against Tottenham is their lowest of the season, while their 10 goals conceded (8.65 xG) in the last five matchdays is tied for worst in the Premier League. We are 14 games into the Premier League season and the leading three teams, Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool, have scored 105 goals between them and have a combined goal difference of +79. Fourth placed West Ham have now slipped seven points behind, and are the only other side in the entire division to have scored more goals than they have let in. We have a three-way title race on our hands, and, in their subtly different ways, Chelsea, City and Liverpool are all the best team in the division; it now just seems a case of finding out which one has fewer off days than the other two between now and May. Tonight City and Chelsea came closest to dropping points. City swept into a customary 2-0 lead at Villa Park, with Raheem Sterling creating five goalscoring chances and Bernardo Silva scoring a goal so good that it sent nearly everyone watching into a joyous frenzy. Find it. Watch it. Watch it again. From back to front, from side to middle, from volley to net. Sensational. But Steven Gerrard’s Aston Villa™️ hit back early in the second half with a wonderful Ollie Watkins goal from a corner. There were further chances, but nothing gilt-edged, and both sides’ xG was low. It’s the sort of game people forget Manchester City experience, scuttling to a 2-1 win with an xG of barely 1.0, but it’s these sort of results that win titles, and it was Pep Guardiola’s 150th victory in the Premier League. They can’t all be 5-0. Aston Villa 1-2 Manchester City: City's win means they now have twice as many points (32) as their opponents Villa (16). pic.twitter.com/bb3EPYRm3q Take with a pinch of salt, being a central defender (and playing for a side like Man City)…but Nathan Aké completed all 58 of his passes versus Aston Villa tonight – the most passes with a 100% accuracy in a PL game this season. #MCFC pic.twitter.com/VcpF6BOp2w 150 – Pep Guardiola tonight earned his 150th Premier League win at Man City – only the fourth manager to reach this total for a club. After just 204 games, this beats Sir Alex Ferguson’s record at Man Utd, who celebrated his 150th win in his 247th match. Mastermind. pic.twitter.com/FAQvccT740 Down at Vicarage Road, in a game that lasted much longer than scheduled due to a medical emergency in the stands, Chelsea did a City and fought out a 2-1 win against a dangerous opponent. Pre-game Thomas Tuchel luxuriated in his deep, deep squad once again and he’s now up to 50 starting XI changes for the season -considerably more than any other side- but Watford were ahead on xG at half-time and ahead on xG at full-time. If you predicted that before the match then you are either lying, Elton John or Emmanuel Dennis. Chelsea’s pass completion of 71% was their lowest in a Premier League game since 2018, but you don’t get bonus points for completing more than 90% of your passes. Not yet anyway. Six goals for Emmanuel Dennis, now. Add five assists to that and it looks like £3m well spent for @WatfordFC! pic.twitter.com/oDPDSvvXII Watford 1-2 Chelsea: Always a good sign for a team if they can win games like this where they don't play particularly well. Tough on Watford, though. pic.twitter.com/inYUQZTuYD But if City and Chelsea spluttered at times this evening, Liverpool enjoyed one of their most famous derby wins of all-time. In a season when they’ve gone to Old Trafford and won 5-0, this was only the third time that the Reds had scored 4+ goals in a league game at Goodison, and the scoreline means that they set a brand new record for English top-flight clubs of 18 games in a row where they’ve scored two or more goals, while they now have 25 on the road in the Premier League this season. The last team to manage more than that in their opening seven away games were Manchester United back in 1907-08 when, let’s be honest, it was almost a completely different sport. 4 – Liverpool have scored four goals in an away league match against Everton for the first time since a 5-0 win in November 1982 under Bob Paisley. Rampant. In a week where major footballing awards were handed to players who only these days run when necessary, the intensity in Liverpool’s performance was as startling as it was typical. The outcome was that Mohamed Salah took his season’s numbers to 19 goals in 19 games, while Jordan Henderson did the sort of Liverpool captain thing that Liverpool captains can occasionally do at Goodison Park. 1 + 1 – Liverpool captain @JHenderson is the first Liverpool player to score and assist at Goodison Park in the same Premier League game since Steven Gerrard in December 2005. Heir. pic.twitter.com/XZ5ei0WVVy Scouting report: This Salah guy looks decent. pic.twitter.com/kk6usetbpc The midweek Premier League fixtures are completed tomorrow when Arsenal travel to Manchester United. Once those two sides put on season-long title races of their own that thrilled their fans and excited the neutrals. Neither side can match the consistency and élan of the Big Three right now, though. They, like the rest of us, will instead have to watch and wait to see which of the trio slips up in this most absorbing 30th Premier League season.  The match clock read 60:11 when Callum Wilson’s scruffy penalty found its way past Tim Krul into the Norwich net. Newcastle, having been reduced to 10 men after only nine minutes when Ciaran Clark was rightly sent off for a professional foul, looked like they might be on course for the sort of backs-to-the-wall gritty win you need when you are battling relegation. But then Norwich woke up, remembered they had a man advantage and equalised via Teemu Pukki’s thumping volley before wasting some excellent chances late on. A point apiece, then, and one that perhaps neither side will be delighted about, when reminiscing about leads that slipped and numerical advantages that weren’t capitalised on. More importantly it means that Newcastle have become only the fourth team in Premier League history not to win any of their opening 14 games. The previous three, as you can see in the image below, all went down, which means that Eddie Howe needs to take inspiration from Sheffield United’s baffling 1990-91 season. Newly-promoted under former Wimbledon boss Dave ‘Harry’ Bassett, the Blades won none of their opening 16 games that season, reaching Christmas with only four points but still turned it around in the New Year to finish a comfortable 13th. Or maybe Howe will point urgently to Leicester 1975-76 who had a highly unusual record of W0 D9 L5 after 14 games. Again, they improved considerably as the season went on and ended up finishing in 7th place. Either way, the fact we are having to delve into the history books to find these rare examples says only one thing: Newcastle United are in big trouble. Ahead of the midweek Premier League action, we look at some key stats from across the 10 fixtures. Newcastle United host Norwich City tonight, hoping to pick up their first Premier League win of the season at the 14th attempt. This game against 19th place opposition is followed by another home match with 18th-placed Burnley at the weekend – if they fail to win any of those games, then you fear the Magpies may go past Sheffield United’s 2020-21 record of no wins in their opening 17, with matches against Leicester City, Liverpool and Manchester City to follow. Despite their lowly position, the Canaries have been in good form of late with two wins and a draw in their last three matches – these seven points being more than they had collected in their previous 25 games in the competition (W1 D3 L21). Each of the last three league campaigns in which Newcastle and Norwich have met, there has been a hat-trick scored – Georginio Wijnaldum and Dwight Gayle for Newcastle (2015-16 and 2016-17 respectively), and Teemu Pukki for Norwich in 2019-20. Will there be another hero tonight? Jamie Vardy enjoyed himself on Sunday, with two goals in Leicester City’s 4-2 Premier League victory over Watford. That brace took him to 127 goals overall in the competition and level 14th in Premier League history alongside Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink – not bad for a striker who’s only scored once in the English top-flight by his 28th birthday. He’s now scored 93 Premier League goals after turning 30 years old, drawing level with Ian Wright’s record in the competition. There’s very little doubt he’ll surpass Wright some time soon, but should he reach 100 (again, doubtful he’ll stop there), will anybody ever be able to catch him? He faces Southampton at St Mary’s this midweek, where he scored a hat-trick in a 9-0 victory for the Foxes in October 2019 after previously scoring two in a 2-2 draw back in October 2015. You wouldn’t rule out him adding to his five Premier League goals at this stadium, tomorrow. Mention a Tuesday night match in the Premier League and Christian Benteke’s eyes light up. The Belgium loves playing on Tuesday, with his average of 121 minutes per goal the best of any day of the week. His tally of 12 goals in 19 Premier League appearances on a Tuesday are bettered by only Alan Shearer (15) and Wayne Rooney (13) in the history of the competition. Benteke’s Palace side visit an out-of-sorts Leeds United at Elland Road tonight – can the striker continue his recent good form with more goals? An out-of-sorts Everton host a Liverpool side who are on a joint English top-flight record run of scoring at least twice in each of their last 17 competitive matches – not an ideal time to face your rivals. Although Everton won 2-0 in their last Premier League game against Liverpool, ending a 20-game winless run against them in the competition, they’ve not won back-to-back league Merseyside derbies since the 1984-85 campaign. This fixture has not only seen the most draws (24) and most red cards (22) in Premier League history – although the last 19 encounters have only seen two dismissals – but it’s also seen the most 90th minute winners in the history of the competition (5). All five of those winners have come for Liverpool, with the last being via Divock Origi at Anfield in a 1-0 win in December 2018.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2021/12/the-data-day-2021-14/,Duncan Alexander,05/12/2021 10:34,the-analyst
10169,Ivory Coast vs Nigeria Prediction and Preview,"As the second round of games at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations begin, we look to Thursday’s Group A clash with our Ivory Coast vs Nigeria prediction and preview. The tournament hosts are back in action in Group A of AFCON 2023 as the Ivory Coast take on Nigeria at Stade Olympique Alassane Ouattara on Thursday. The Elephants impressed in their opening game against Guinea-Bissau, with goals from Seko Fofana and Jean-Philippe Krasso handing them a 2-0 win. It wouldn’t be a surprise to see Ivory Coast avoid defeat throughout the group stage, with host nations of AFCON only having lost once in their last 38 group-stage games (W23 D14). The last time the tournament hosts lost at this stage was when Equatorial Guinea were beaten 1-0 by Zambia as joint-hosts in 2012. Jean-Louis Gasset’s side are looking to win their first two games of an AFCON since 2013, and take on Nigeria next, who were held to a surprise 1-1 draw by Equatorial Guinea in their first match. Star striker Victor Osimhen equalised for the Super Eagles just 99 seconds after Iban Salvador had given Equatorial Guinea the lead, but despite recording an expected goals total of 3.52, José Peseiro’s men were unable to find a winner.  Osimhen had six shots, but finished the game with just a single goal to show for his efforts. The last time a Nigerian player had more shots in a single group stage game in the competition was Peter Odemwingie (seven) against Mozambique in January 2010. This will be Ivory Coast and Nigeria’s seventh meeting at the Africa Cup of Nations. As things stand, they can’t be separated. Of their six games for far, they have won two each and drawn two, scoring five goals each. Their last AFCON meeting was in 2013. Nigeria won 2-1 in the quarter-finals and went on to lift the trophy. The three previous meetings between Ivory Coast and Nigeria in the group stage of the tournament have produced only two goals (0-0 in 1980, 1-0 to Nigeria in 1990, 1-0 to Ivory Coast in 2008). According to the Opta supercomputer, it should be a close game but Ivory Coast are predicted to clinch their passage to the last 16 with a win in 40.7% of pre-match simulations. Nigeria grabbed their first victory of AFCON 2023 in 32.8% of those, while the draw occurred 27.5% of the time.  Understandably after being the only team in Group A to win their first game, the tournament hosts are heavily fancied to advance, doing so in 96.7% of simulations at the time of writing, and winning the group 63.6% of the time. Below are both teams’ current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Ivory Coast: Charles Folly, Yahia Fofana, Badra Ali Sangaré, Evan Ndicka, Wilfried Singo, Ousmane Diomande, Ismaël Diallo, Sèrge Aurier, Odilon Kossounou, Ghislain Konan, Willy-Arnaud Boly, Seko Fofana, Jean Seri, Franck Kessié, Idrissa Doumbia, Ibrahim Sangaré, Lazare Amani, Max Gradel, Jérémie Boga, Simon Adingra, Oumar Diakité, Jean-Philippe Krasso, Sébastien Haller, Jonathan Bamba, Christian Kouamé, Nicolas Pépé, Karim Konaté.  Coach: Jean-Louis Gasset Nigeria: Olorunleke Ojo, Stanley Nwabali, Francis Uzoho, Kenneth Omeruo, William Troost-Ekong, Semi Ajayi, Chidozie Awaziem, Calvin Bassey, Bruno Onyemaechi, Bright Osayi-Samuel, Ola Aina, Zaidu Sanusi, Alhassan Yusuf, Raphael Onyedika, Joe Aribo, Frank Onyeka, Moses Simon, Ahmed Musa, Alex Iwobi, Victor Osimhen, Kelechi Iheanacho, Samuel Chukwueze, Terem Moffi, Ademola Lookman, Umar Sadiq.  Coach: Jose Peseiro Enjoy this?

2669,Man Utd star Mata surprises as he picks Koeman to manage 'Perfect XI' of former team-mates,"Juan Mata has rubbed shoulders with some superstar players and coaches down the years, but the Manchester United midfielder has turned heads by picking Ronald Koeman to manage a ‘Perfect XI’ of those he has previously worked alongside. The 33-year-old midfielder is a World Cup winner with 41 caps for Spain to his name and stints at Valencia, Chelsea and Old Trafford on a glittering CV. Down the years he has shared a dressing room for some distinguished bosses, including Jose Mourinho, Unai Emery and Louis van Gaal, but Mata considers a Dutch tactician to have done the most for him. Explaining that decision when piecing together a team for FourFourTwo, Mata has said of giving Koeman – who last occupied a dugout at La Liga giants Barcelona - the nod: “This might surprise a few people, but I owe so much to him. “When I was 19, I was having a difficult moment at Valencia and not playing very much. He saw me in training once, took me aside and said: ‘I think you can play, so keep doing what you’re doing. Play with confidence – I’ve got faith in you and want you to express yourself.’ “Koeman was the first manager to trust me in professional football, even though there were other more experienced players in my position, like Vicente.” Mata unsurprisingly picked a couple of iconic strikers to lead the line for him, with Manchester United’s all-time leading goalscorer Wayne Rooney paired with Chelsea legend Didier Drogba and former Barcelona star David Villa in a fearsome front three. He said of Rooney: “Another of English football’s greats. He could do everything on the pitch – even play as a midfielder – so he has to be in this XI. He broke the goalscoring record for both United and England, and it was a privilege to play with him.” Mata added on Ivorian frontman Drogba: “We’ve shared some fantastic memories together, especially that night in Munich when Didier scored the winning penalty in the 2012 Champions League Final. He could create goals for himself, taking the ball in the middle of the pitch and driving forward, and was so powerful in the air.” Branislav Ivanovic, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry and Patrice Evra were selected across Mata’s back four, while Ryan Giggs, Frank Lampard and Ryan Giggs fill midfield berths. He went with a close friend between the sticks, with David de Gea’s presence in goal justified by saying: “David is a very good friend, and also the most talented goalkeeper that I’ve ever played with – his reactions are amazing. Every goalkeeping coach will tell you his natural ability is unbelievable.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-mata-surprises-picks-koeman-manage-perfect-xi-former/blte52f6d8bb2bd72ec,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
9366,Laporta: 'Real Madrid can't talk much. They appointed referees for 70 years',"""I am sure that Barça will be acquitted,"" Joan Laporta said of the Negreira case. ""It is a campaign orchestrated, not only by Madrid, but also by La Liga, in which I am still in.""Barcelona were found to have paid €7.3m to Negreira, the vice-president of the referees governing body, between 2013 and 2018. They are now accused of corruption.The Catalans president continued shifting the blame: ""Madrid is not behaving well.

5646,"We won't crucify Mbappe for Real Madrid snub, insists Modric as he leaves door open for future transfer","Luka Modric says there is no need to ""crucify"" Kylian Mbappe over his decision to snub Real Madrid and stay at Paris Saint-Germain. Mbappe appeared destined to leave PSG in a free transfer and join the European and Spanish champions, but he instead signed a new contract with the French side that keeps him tied to the club until 2025. The news infuriated many in Spain, as Liga president Javier Tebas denounced Mbappe's contract extension as ""an insult to football"" and filed a complaint to UEFA about PSG. Modric remained diplomatic about the 23-year-old's decision to snub Madrid and says the club can thrive without him. ""Mbappe decided as he decided, that is his right and now he lives with that decision. It goes on,"" he told Sportske.  ""We all thought he would come to us, it didn't happen and - now what? Well, we're not going to crucify the man. ""Mbappe is a great player, but as I always repeat, in any context, no player is more important than the club. Real is the greatest, above every player and it will always be like that. ""Who knows what can happen tomorrow, let alone in three or four years in football? Only time will tell."" Madrid are looking to build on their Champions League and La Liga success last season. Carlo Ancelotti returned to Santiago Bernabeu to guide the capital club to the two titles and Modric credited the coach's ""calmness and stability"" as crucial factors in their 2021-22 season. ""In La Liga, we got off to a particularly good start from the very beginning,"" he said.  ""A new old coach arrived, Carlo Ancelotti, who found a lot of players from his first era at Madrid. This made it easier to adapt to the new course, after all the great years with Zinedine Zidane.  ""Ancelotti brought some new calmness, stability and created an environment of mutual trust and faith in one's strengths.  ""It wasn't strange to me, because as much as some tried to belittle the strength of this group of players, I was personally convinced that we still have a top team.  ""Things came together for us, we made a strong run and by the end we deservedly and dominantly won the 35th title, my third.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/we-wont-crucify-mbappe-real-madrid-modric/blt65e484250461e886,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5673,Any coach who plays Neymar on the wing is a donkey! - Brazil boss Tite,"Brazil boss Tite refuses to accept criticism of Neymar as a central player, with the man in charge of the 2022 World Cup favourites claiming that any coach playing his star man on the wing is “a donkey”. The Paris Saint-Germain superstar is considered by some to have lost his spark since being moved inside off the flanks from the wide role he played when starring alongside Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi at Barcelona, and transfer talk has now resurfaced as a result. He is operating down the middle in France, with Messi and Kylian Mbappe either side of him, while he plays as  a central No.10 for Brazil, with the 30-year-old forward now up to 74 goals for the Selecao. Tite has no doubt they Neymar should be at the centre of any attacking unit that he graces, with questions of his ball retention shrugged off as his game is all about trying to make things happen. The Brazil boss has told the Sextra Estrela podcast: “He's not a problem, he's a solution. “They say Neymar will make more mistakes playing there. But it's his position that makes him make more mistakes, because everything he does in creative terms there will be decisive.” Tite went on to say: “If a coach plays Neymar on the wing, I will call him a donkey. It considerably restricts the creative capacity of a player with these qualities. “Creativity is not constancy, it is contingency, it is circumstantial. He will make more mistakes, yes, because his creative ability is where he is required.” PSG are willing to sell Neymar this summer if an acceptable offer arrives 😬 pic.twitter.com/I0OVAMh6Nr The South American superstar made a record-breaking €222 million (£200m/$262m) switch to PSG from Barcelona during the summer of 2017. That move was made with the intention of becoming a leading man in his own right, having operated in the considerable shadow of seven-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi at Camp Nou. He hit 28 goals through 30 games in his debut campaign, but has slipped slowly backwards since then. Neymar’s returns across the last four seasons have been 23, 19, 17 and 13, respectively. Those efforts have allowed him to reach 100 goals for the Ligue 1 champions, while collecting more major honours, but Mbappe has become the star man at Parc des Princes. With Brazil, Neymar will lead them into another quest for global glory at the World Cup finals in Qatar later this year, with only three more goals required in order to match the all-time leading record of legendary former frontman Pele.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/coach-plays-neymar-wing-donkey-brazil-tite/blt58d21a2d92841a3f,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
143,Ronaldo's record-breaking night proves new Man Utd boss Rangnick can rely on him,"If Cristiano Ronaldo felt the need to send a message to his new manager – after all the talk that he would not fit into his setup – then scoring twice to secure Manchester United three points against Arsenal is one way to do it.  Ralf Rangnick was in the stands to watch his new team and while he will have seen plenty of problems that need rectifying, Ronaldo would not appear to be among them. Rangnick was on his feet applauding the Portuguese for his 800th and 801st career goals respectively.  Whether he presses enough or not, he still should be considered for the starting XI every week.  As he made his run into the box in the 52nd minute, the Arsenal players knew what was coming. A low Marcus Rashford cross came into the box and Ronaldo was there to finish it.  He has also now taken over penalty duties from Bruno Fernandes and dispatched what proved to be the winning goal from the spot after Martin Odegaard fouled Fred.  It is that inevitability, almost a guarantee of goals, that has led to managers tailoring their teams around the 36-year-old.  Ronaldo has an aura around him; just ask the fan who ran onto the pitch with 86 minutes on the clock in an attempt to get a selfie with him.  However, you don’t get the sense that Rangnick will bow down to him and, in a week when he made his feelings known about yet another Lionel Messi Ballon d’Or, maybe that’s why Ronaldo seemed so determined to prove a point against Arsenal.  Two goals will certainly help his cause but his work off the ball is more likely to impress Rangnick. He hassled the Arsenal back line all evening, chasing loose balls and putting in a shift at both ends of the pitch.  With United holding on to a 3-2 lead, he cleared an Arsenal corner before sprinting the length of the pitch in an attempt to get on the end of a counterattack.  Rangnick, who sat making notes throughout the game, will no doubt have questions to answer about Ronaldo in the days and weeks to come. But whether he should start or not should not be one of them.  Since he rejoined the club, he has scored three winning goals in the Premier League and has single-handedly kept them in the Champions League with six goals in five group-stage games. Without his contribution, they would not be through to the last 16 with a game to play.  However, while Ronaldo’s name might have been struck off the to-do list, there are still a few issues to resolve. For starters, United are still conceding too many goals. Emile Smith-Rowe’s bizarre opener means they have conceded in 15 consecutive home games in all competitions – their worst run since 1959.  There are issues with control and dominance in midfield and, at times, they were again slow and pedestrian.  Credit should go to Michael Carrick, the stand-in coach who tearfully stepped away from the club at full time.  He stepped up at a time when the team were in dire need of direction and led them to two big victories and a draw against one of the favourites to win the league this term in Chelsea.  Now, it’s over to Rangnick.  If Carrick can pass on any advice to him as he departs, it is the importance of Ronaldo.  “He has been terrific this week, especially for me, the things I’ve asked of him and the way he has gone about his business in and around the place, he's been absolutely top top drawer,” Carrick said. “No surprise he goes and scores tonight, the perfect ending really.”  Rangnick won’t be sure of many things on his first day in the job but he knows one thing for certain: he’ll be able to rely on Ronaldo.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-proves-man-utd-boss-rangnick-can-rely-on-him/blt70c882cc7206ec74,Charlotte Duncker,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

While some of his team-mates celebrated, the stars on the other side had to drop and do some push-ups before they could leave the game. But France international Dembele tried to make his escape without dropping to the ground before being surrounded by the winners, who did not let him off the hook. Dembele has appeared to be in especially positive spirits of late after re-signing with the Blaugrana.

Dembele has shown his sense of humour off at Barca ever since signing a new contract with the club. According to a report in Mundo Deportivo, he gave a dressing room speech to the Barca players after he committed to a two-year deal with the club. During his talk, Dembele is said to have asked to be made the team's captain, much to the shock of the others, but drew laughter after he admitted he was just joking.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/watch-dembele-tries-to-escape-training-punishment-in-latest/bltdbc07d9c25a4a438,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1191,Man Utd's Jones: I'm still good enough to play at the highest level,"Phil Jones believes that he is still good enough to continue to play at the highest level, as the Manchester United defender eyes a return to regular football following several years sat on the sidelines. The former England defender made his long-awaited return to first-team action earlier this season, ending a 712-day absence after a debilitating run of injuries kept him out of consistent action. Yet his chances have still been limited since his first game back in January, and a reported loan move to Bordeaux collapsed - but the 30-year-old says that he feels fortunate enough to have had the career he has had, and that he still thinks he can offer more over the coming years. ""I feel lucky,"" Jones told The Guardian. “I’m 100% lucky to have played in two World Cups, been through the Euros and had some fantastic moments at Old Trafford with some amazing players. ""Of course people say: ‘You should have done this, you could have done that, blah blah blah.’ But I feel so lucky.  “I’m still only 30 and I’ve missed a lot of football. I’m hoping to recapture some form and enjoy playing football. When I was out injured it was a difficult time but I’ll never give up. I feel like I’m still good enough and I’ve got a lot to give. So I’m hopeful. I’m ready to play again.” One of a handful of players among the current Manchester United crop to actually win the Premier League, alongside stars such as Cristiano Ronaldo and David De Gea, Jones has often found himself battling against a less-than-stellar reputation on the field. But his admirers remain many, and even if he has to bring the curtain down on his stay at Manchester United, he is unlikely to be short of potential suitors who would consider his experience crucial. ""Let’s see what happens,"" he added. ""I’m hoping I can get some game time and I’m giving everything in training every day.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-jones-im-still-good-enough-play-at-highest-level/blt912c69a0b121823a,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7279,Rangnick: Man Utd are the only team in the Premier League that concede goals like this,"Ralf Rangnick believes Manchester United leave too much space for teams to capitalise on after their 3-2 win against Norwich on Saturday. A Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick fired the Red Devils to an important win at Old Trafford, but it was not an easy one for Rangnick's team. Despite going two goals down, Norwich managed to claw their way back into the game and pulled level. It took a third effort from Ronaldo to put his team back  in control of the game and Rangnick says his side have a unique weakness in the Premier League. ""I told the team we were playing with a very offensive formation and line-up, with Paul Pogba and Bruno in midfield and Jesse,"" he told reporters. ""I think this is a very offensive formation and line-up and that’s why I told them that it’s very important that we play with a defensive mindset and everybody has to think like a defensive midfielder.  ""Like I said, after we scored the second goal we allowed too much open space in transitional moments and if you look at the two goals we conceded, especially the first one, we had the ball on the sideline but we just were not physical enough.  ""As soon as there is body contact we need to become physical and more aggressive, but we weren’t and for me it was too easy.  ""We are the only team in the league to concede goals like this. We were all behind the ball in that moment so it is not a question of tactical discipline, it’s a question of how physical do we defend in moments like this."" The Red Devils are among the teams still pushing for a spot in next season's Champions League group stage. Tottenham curently occupy fourth place despite their 1-0 loss against Brighton on Saturday.

6069,Will Martial get his January wish to leave Man Utd?,"Ralf Rangnick has been in charge at Manchester United for less than two weeks, but it is already clear that he has no time for playing games. Three days after Rangnick phoned Paul Pogba, for example, the France midfielder was back in the country having spent the previous few weeks in Dubai undergoing rehabilitation for his thigh injury. The new interim boss at Old Trafford believed that Pogba should be doing his recovery work in Manchester, while he was not interested in getting into discussions over the France international's as-yet unsigned new contract either. The message was clear: if Pogba, or any other player, does not want to be at the club, Rangnick will not be going out of his way to persuade them to stay.  It is a message that will likely have been heard by Anthony Martial. Martial's agent, Philippe Lamboley, told Sky Sports on Friday that his client is looking for a January exit from the Red Devils. “Anthony wishes to leave the club in January,” Lamboley said. “He just needs to play. He doesn’t want to stay in January, and I will speak to the club soon.” At this stage, there has been no formal transfer request submitted by Martial, and Rangnick is not interested in chasing the player to see whether he actually wants to stay. Martial, for his part, has not been in contention to appear in any of Rangnick's three games in charge due to a ""painful knee"", but overall the season so far has been a far cry from the campaign the ex-Monaco forward believed he was going to have when he embarked upon pre-season training in July.  The straight-faced attacker has earned a reputation around United for rarely being able to crack a smile, so much so that it has become a joke that even the club’s in-house social media team has used on Twitter. Despite that, sources suggested to GOAL that he actually came across a more relaxed and happier figure than usual during the club’s summer training sessions.  His mood, though, has since deteriorated, as the decision to bring Cristiano Ronaldo back to the club late in the summer transfer window left Martial under no illusions as to how the Portugal icon's return would affect his own chances of first-team minutes. So far this term, he has made only 10 appearances in all competitions, with just four of those coming as a starter. Ronaldo, Jadon Sancho, Mason Greenwood, Marcus Rashford and Edinson Cavani are all ahead of him in the pecking order, while Rangnick has been keen to give opportunities to teenage duo Anthony Elanga and Amad Diallo too. You can understand, then, why he would be eyeing the exit door, especially given the World Cup is less than a year away and right now it would be difficult for Didier Deschamps to justify selecting him for Qatar 2022. But whose fault is it that he has fallen so far down the pecking order? Martial's lack of consistency has been a frustration for coaches and supporters alike, while sources have said that some members of United's staff are concerned with the way he ""turns it on and off"" in both training sessions and matches. Many believe there is a world-class player lurking somewhere inside Martial, but he is now 26, and after a good season in 2019-20, where he scored 23 goals in all competitions, he has returned to the mediocre form that has plagued his time at United. Last season, where he did admittedly suffer from injuries, he finished with just seven goals from 36 appearances. Is it any wonder he was not considered as first choice under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer? Solskjaer may not have helped the situation, as the Norwegian regularly looked to protect his players from the media by bending the truth when it came to the reasons why they were not being selected. Such an instance came in October, when Solskjaer claimed that Martial's absence from the squad was injury-related, only for Melanie Martial - Anthony's wife - to take to Instagram and claim otherwise by posting a picture of her husband using an exercise bike at home. Regardless, Martial has not shown enough when he has been on the pitch to suggest that he deserves more playing time and that United should be doing all they can to keep him at the club. The problem comes with who would want to buy him. Martial signed a new contract in 2019 to keep him at the club until 2024, with the option for a further year included, and United will not want to let him go on the cheap. It has become a common theme in recent years for United to tie players down to expensive, long-term deals and then struggle to offload them when they become surplus to requirements or want to move on, and Martial looks set to follow that pattern. Rangnick has already made it clear he would be open to loan moves for some players when the winter market opens, while if the right offer were to come in for a player who is making it clear, through his agent, that he does not want to be at the club, then they would be open to listening.  “We need to make sure that players want to stay here,” Rangnick said last week. “If they are still not getting enough game time here, it might make sense to speak individually with the players and see if a loan might make sense. But now it's still too early to speak about that.” Martial may, then, get his Christmas wish, and if he truly does want to leave and a fair price is agreed, then few at United would be too concerned if he were to depart.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/will-martial-get-january-wish-leave-man-utd/blt8992694fe11b7688,Charlotte Duncker,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2355,De Ligt joins Bayern Munich in €77m deal as Chelsea miss out on defensive transfer target,"Juventus defender Matthijs de Ligt has completed a permanent transfer to Bayern Munich. The Dutchman brings the curtain down on his three-year stint in Italy to join Julian Nagelsmann's ranks at Allianz Arena, and will now integrate with the squad ahead of their 2022-23 season opener next month. Bayern have brought in one of the most highly-rated centre-backs in Europe after finalising a deal with Juve, where he became a Serie A and Coppa Italia winner. Bayern have paid an initial fee of €67 million (£57m/$69m) for De Ligt, with the deal set to be worth an extra €10m (£8.5m/$10m) in add-ons if certain performance and commercial-related clauses are met. Matthijs de Ligt is officially a Bayern Munich player 🔴 pic.twitter.com/IcnYu7Gvik De Ligt has put pen to paper on a five-year contract at Bayern, which will see him remain at Allianz Arena through to the end of the 2026-27 season. As confirmed by GOAL, Chelsea were also chasing De Ligt after seeing Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen leave Stamford Bridge this summer, but ultimately dropped out of the race when it became clear that his preference was to join Bayern. Paris Saint-Germain were strongly linked with the Netherlands international too, but he will now continue his development with the German champions. De Ligt has become Bayern's fourth summer transfer window signing, with Sadio Mane, Ryan Gravenberch and Noussair Mazraoui having also been snapped up on permanent deals. The Bundesliga giants have, though, seen top scorer Robert Lewandowski depart for Barcelona, and it has been suggested that they will seek a replacement before the market slams shut. Tottenham's Harry Kane and Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo had both been mooted as potential targets, but Bayern have publicly distanced themselves from the duo, while they have also been credited with an interest in Napoli's Victor Osimhen. One striker they are certainly keen on is Rennes teenager Mathys Tel, though the French club have rejected two offers from Bayern thus far, with a fee of around €25m (£21m/$25m) likely required to get the deal done. Midfield reinforcements are also required before the window shuts, with Nagelsmann keen to bring in Konrad Laimer, who he coached during his time in charge of RB Leipzig.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/de-ligt-bayern-munich-chelsea-miss-out-transfer-target/bltcac670e1b986d012,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Mane got there first, with Josimar slamming into the Liverpool winger. Slow motion replays appeared to indicate that Mane was unconscious as he fell to the floor. Josimar was sent off as a result after a lengthy VAR check, leaving Cape Verde down to nine men after Ptrick Andrade was dismissed in the first half. Remarkably however, Mane was allowed to play on despite the rules about players suffering from possible concussions - and showed his quality a little over 10 minutes later. ⚽️ ¡GOOOOL!Con la aprobación del VAR, Sadio Mané le da la ventaja a Senegal#TeamSenegal 1-0 #TeamCapeVerde 🇸🇳🆚🇨🇻⤵️ pic.twitter.com/sy1tVtUDxW Collecting a half-cleared corner on the edge of the Cape Verde penalty area in the 63rd minute, Mane had the time and space to pick his spot and place a wonderful shot in off the underside of the crossbar.

344,Why Shearer rates Drogba ahead of Salah as best ever African in Premier League,"Newcastle United legend Alan Shearer believes ex-Chelsea striker Didier Drogba, is the greatest African to have played in the Premier League. The Ivorian spent nine years at the club in two different stints, guiding them to several major trophies. His initial stint was between 2004 and 2012, while his second was in the 2014/15 season. Yaya Toure, Nwankwo Kanu, Emmanuel Adebayor, Jay-Jay Okocha and recently Liverpool duo Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane are some of the players who have excelled in the Premier League. For instance, Salah has been a hit at Liverpool since joining in 2017. Apart from scoring more than 150 goals for them, he has won the Premier League title, the Champions League and the Fifa Club World Cup. However, Shearer still rates Drogba higher than the Egypt captain, ""For me, it’s Drogba just for the fact that he has four Premier League titles, four FA cups, nine goals in nine cup finals, one Champions League title and 177 goals for Chelsea, that is for me,"" Shearer said as quoted by the London World. Shearer's sentiments are the same as those expressed by Nigerian football icon Yakubu Ayegbeni in a previous interview when he was comparing Salah and Drogba. The former Everton and Middlesbrough goal machine did not see the rationale for considering the 29-year-old as the best African to have graced the English top-flight – although the ‘Yak’ marveled at the ex-AS Roma star’s exploits in Jurgen Klopp’s squad so far. ""You cannot say Salah is the greatest African to play in the Premier League. Drogba was something special because he was scoring for fun,"" Ayegbeni told GOAL.  ""However, you have to give Salah the credit for breaking the big legend’s record, which makes him one of the greatest Africans in the English top-flight, but for now, he is certainly not the greatest.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-shearer-rates-drogba-ahead-of-salah-as-best-ever-african/blt8dfb17484d10537a,Seth Willis,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7393,'Bayern don't need a No.9' - Lewandowski claims old club won't have to directly replace him after Barcelona transfer,"Robert Lewandowski has insisted that Bayern Munich won't have to bring in a direct replacement for him following his switch to Barcelona. Lewandowski has joined the Blaugrana in a €50 million (£43m/$60m) summer deal, bringing to an end his eight-year stay at Allianz Arena. It has been suggested that the Poland international's departure has weakened Bayern, but he insists that Julian Nagelsmann still has plenty of high-quality options to call upon in attack. Sadio Mane has been the only new addition to Bayern's ranks in the final third so far this summer, but Lewandowski expects the German giants to adapt to life without him seamlessly. ""I think Bayern have so many talented offensive players that you don't necessarily need a No.9, a real centre forward,"" the 33-year-old has told Sport Bild. ""Bayern's attack is outstanding, they can manage it very well, even without a one-on-one replacement for me."" During his last training session in the kit of FC Bayern, Robert Lewandowski said goodbye to his teammates and some of the club's staff. Lewandowski also listed the players he believes to be capable of helping Bayern fill the void left by his departure.

10642,West Ham vs Manchester City: Prediction and Preview,"Manchester City are looking to maintain their perfect start to the Premier League season, but they should face a stern test against unbeaten West Ham. We look ahead to Saturday’s fixture at the London Stadium with our West Ham vs Manchester City prediction and preview. Manchester City have started their latest Premier League title defence ominously, setting the pace at the top of the league table with four consecutive wins. However, if anyone can stop Pep Guardiola’s winning machine, it might just be in-form West Ham. David Moyes’ Hammers are flying high in fourth with 10 points from four games, matching their best-ever start to a Premier League campaign (in 1999-00) with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Luton Town prior to the international break, with Jarrod Bowen and Kurt Zouma on the scoresheet. West Ham’s start is made all the more impressive by the identities of their opponents, upsetting Chelsea and Brighton and Hove Albion before their win at Kenilworth Road. They could win four successive Premier League games for the first time since November 2021 on Saturday, when they will hope to triumph in a stark clash of styles. While only Chelsea (70.8%) have averaged a greater possession share than Man City’s 67.5% in the Premier League this season, only Nottingham Forest (32.0%) and Luton (33.8%) have seen less of the ball than West Ham (36.2%). The Hammers have moved the ball forwards at a speed of 2.29 metres per second in 2023-24, making them the most unashamedly direct side in the top flight. City sit at the other end of that table, attacking with a direct speed of just 1.11 metres per second.  The power of Michail Antonio and the set-piece prowess of James Ward-Prowse have been key to West Ham’s approach, with the latter recording his third assist of the season – a Premier League joint-high – from a corner at Luton for Zouma’s goal. Ward-Prowse has ably filled the Declan Rice-shaped hole in West Ham’s midfield, either scoring or assisting in five successive Premier League games (two goals, four assists) for the second time, having also done so between December 2021 and January 2022 for Southampton. He has never been directly involved in a goal in six consecutive Premier League matches. Fellow new recruit Edson Álvarez could partner Ward-Prowse in midfield again, though Tomáš Souček is in contention after missing West Ham’s last match with a concussion. Injuries have delayed Konstantinos Mavropanos’ debut, but he is available after scoring twice for Greece during the international break. Man City are the only Premier League team with a perfect record after Erling Haaland’s hat-trick – as well as goals from Julián Álvarez and Nathan Aké – helped them beat Fulham in a 5-1 win at the Etihad Stadium a fortnight ago. That result made City the 26th team to start a Premier League season with four consecutive victories, but that may not be a good omen as just eight of the previous 25 went on to be champions. Only one of City’s seven Premier League titles have arrived in a campaign in which they started with four wins (2011-12). However, none of that will concern Guardiola, who will be back in the dugout after missing two games to recover from back surgery. He is unbeaten in his 14 Premier League games against West Ham, winning 12 and drawing two. Sir Alex Ferguson is the only manager to face a single club more often without losing in the competition’s history (16 against Charlton Athletic). With Kevin De Bruyne and Jack Grealish sidelined, and Mateo Kovačić missing both of Croatia’s fixtures during the international break, Guardiola may lean on Phil Foden’s creativity. Only Brighton duo Kaoru Mitoma (14) and Pervis Estupiñán (12) have bettered Foden’s 11 chances created from open play in the Premier League this season. John Stones – who hasn’t played since August’s FA Community Shield defeat to Arsenal due to a hip injury – remains absent, but deadline-day acquisition Matheus Nunes could make his City debut after joining from Wolves. As ever, Haaland will provide City’s chief goal threat. His record across the first four matchdays of 2023-24 mirrors his return from last season, when he scored twice on Matchday 1, failed to net on Matchday 2, scored once on Matchday 3 and hit a hat-trick in City’s fourth game. West Ham fans might want to look away – Haaland hit a first-half treble against Forest on Matchday 5 last term. West Ham are winless in their last 15 Premier League games against Man City (three draws, 12 defeats), last beating them at the Etihad in September 2015 (2-1). Only once have the Hammers endured a longer winless run against a specific team in the Premier League, going 16 without victory against Manchester United between 1993 and 2001. The omens aren’t great for Moyes on a personal level, either. Having picked up 40 points from 22 Premier League games against City while in charge of Everton (12 wins, four draws, six defeats), he has earned just two points from 13 combined matches against them with Manchester United, Sunderland and West Ham. The London side have beaten the reigning Premier League champions five times in total, with the last four instances coming at home – two against Chelsea, one apiece against City and United. However, they have lost nine of their last 10 meetings with the title holders, drawing once. Man City enjoyed a memorable success when they visited the London Stadium on the opening weekend of last season, Haaland marking his Premier League debut with a brace in a 2-0 win. Haaland then broke the record for most goals in a single Premier League season when City last met West Ham in May, with a 3-0 triumph at the Etihad helping City inch towards the title. West Ham have only lost one of their last six Premier League games in a run stretching back to May, winning four times during that span. At home, the Hammers have won three league matches on the spin, overcoming Manchester United and Leeds United in May before downing London rivals Chelsea last month. Man City, however, have won 16 of their last 18 Premier League matches (one draw, one defeat), and they will relish the challenge of facing their in-form hosts. Guardiola’s side have only lost one of their last 11 Premier League games against teams starting the day inside the top four when at least five matches into a season (eight wins, two draws), with Man Utd inflicting that defeat in January. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Despite West Ham’s promising start, the Opta supercomputer is backing Manchester City to stay perfect on Saturday, giving the champions a 59.5% chance of making it a fifth win in five games to start the 2023-24 Premier League campaign. West Ham are assigned a 16.6% chance of the win, with the likelihood of a draw rated at 23.9%. The Opta supercomputer considers Man City overwhelming favourites to retain their title, with Guardiola’s men emerging victorious in 90.9% of 10,000 season simulations conducted ahead of kick-off. West Ham are given a 15.7% chance of a surprise top-four finish, which would bring UEFA Champions League qualification. Enjoy this?

11482,Five Reasons Why Arsenal Fans Should Remain Optimistic About 2022-23,"The Premier League’s big encounter this weekend ended as a 3-1 win for Manchester United over Arsenal. The Gunners were always going to drop points at some point, and Old Trafford was as likely a place as any. Supporters of Samoan club Lupe o le Soaga are welcome to disagree (they of course won every league game they played in both 2017 and 2020) but no Premier League side is going to breeze through an entire season with a 100% record. In fact, Arsenal’s defeat on Sunday should be embraced by the club’s fans because it only strengthens the legacy of the 2003-04 Invincible season. Only Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur remain unbeaten in the league this season and neither of them will still be so in May. That’s a semi-guarantee. And there are plenty of reasons why Arsenal fans shouldn’t feel too down about losing to United. They’re still top of the table for starters, and here are five others to keep supporters upbeat. Stroll around north London and you’ll hear hushed conversations about the prowess of Nicolas Jover, Arsenal’s set-piece coach. He and Mikel Arteta worked together at Manchester City and since Jover joined Arsenal just over a year ago, the club’s threat from set-plays has rocketed. There was evidence of that at Old Trafford with some well worked indirect free-kick and corner routines in the first half and it’s absolutely no surprise that Arsenal lead the league in set-piece expected goals this season. The same applies at the other end of the pitch too, with Arsenal having allowed less xG from set plays than any other club. In a league where every point counts, sneaking points from goals derived from shrewd training-ground routines is surely going to make a difference over 38 games.  What does being top of the Premier League after six games usually get you? The answer – generally – is a top four finish, which is surely Arsenal’s main aim this season. Since Leeds started like a machine in 2001-02 yet went from top after six matches to fifth place by the end of the season, only one other top-after-six-games side has failed to finish in the top four at the end of that season. That was Everton two seasons ago who, under Carlo Ancelotti, had a W-D-L record of 4-1-1 at this stage of the season but eventually faded to 10th place. Are Arsenal a better football team in a better place than 2020-21 Everton were? Undoubtedly. Are Arsenal going to finish in the top four this season? It’s pretty likely, you know.  Gabriel Jesus did not deserve to be on the losing side at Old Trafford on Sunday. The former Manchester City man took a physical mauling from some of Manchester United’s defenders but despite mouthing “wow” after one particularly… robust challenge, he stoically got up for more on each occasion. The Brazilian has the sort of elite mentality you’d expect from someone who’s won more Premier League titles (four) than Arsenal (three) and his attacking discipline has visibly improved the players around him. His professionalism even extends to an utter respect of popular chance quality-rating metric xG, with all 20 of Jesus’s shots this season coming from inside the penalty area. The next highest shot total by someone with a 100% inside-box ratio is Tomás Soucek, who has had 10 efforts at goal this season and is an entirely different sort of player. If Arsenal can maintain or improve the supply line to Jesus over the next few games then he will add to his total of three goals without a doubt.  The signing of Oleksandr Zinchenko was an astute move from Arsenal, particularly given their twin concerns of a relatively small squad and Kieran Tierney’s frequent injury problems. Zinchenko is a midfielder by trade but became a luxury full-back under Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, and that’s the role he has played for Arsenal so far. Against United the Ukrainian returned to the Arsenal XI after an injury of his own and had the relatively difficult job of handling debutant Antony. United’s first goal, scored by their new signing, came after Zinchenko chose to try and close down Marcus Rashford on the edge of the box, leaving Antony free on the right-hand side of the box. The subsequent goal, and Antony’s influence in general, showed the limitations of Zinchenko as a defender in Big Six games, and The Analyst zones of control viz helps illustrate Arteta’s left-flank conundrum. Arsenal are conceding touches to their opponents in the left-back zones but the considerable pay-off is that they are dominating the left flank in an attacking sense, with Gabriel Martinelli a keen beneficiary, despite his VAR-based woes. Whether Arteta moves Zinchenko into midfield and restores Tierney to the defence remains to be seen but it’s a fine balance on that flank. The Arsenal manager has the right tools to make it work in both directions, he just needs to find the optimal blend and reap the rewards. At the moment, somewhat ironically, it is all or nothing. Today is Bukayo Saka’s 21st birthday. That landmark used to be an important one in life terms, and it remains the point at which a gifted footballer graduates from being classed as a promising youngster to a real talent. Saka scored Arsenal’s consolation goal at Old Trafford which means he turns 21 with 35 Premier League goal involvements (18G 17A). Only 10 players in Premier League history have had more than that aged by their 21st birthday, and none of the 10 above him had to feature as a defender, as Saka has on nine occasions in his Premier League career. Last season Saka had 18 goal involvements and is on course to go one better in 2022-23. That, though, assumes he plays at the same level this season; in reality his rate of improvement suggests an output of 20+ goal involvements is well within his grasp.  Most PL goal involvements before 21st birthday:Robbie Fowler (76)Michael Owen (73)Wayne Rooney (66)Cesc Fàbregas (52)Romelu Lukaku (43)Dele Alli (40)Ryan Giggs, Emile Heskey (39)Chris Sutton, Raheem Sterling (38)Alan Smith, Nicolas Anelka, 🆕 Bukayo Saka 🆕 (35)",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2022/09/why-arsenal-fans-should-remain-optimistic/,Duncan Alexander,05/09/2022 9:03,the-analyst
10123,Egypt vs DR Congo Prediction and Preview,"We look ahead to this AFCON 2023 last-16 tie at the Laurent Pokou Stadium in San Pédro with our Egypt vs DR Congo prediction and preview. The AFCON 2023 draw specialists will meet on Sunday, as Egypt and DR Congo battle for a spot in the quarter-finals. Both nations drew all three of their games in the group stage, becoming just the fifth and sixth teams since 1996 to qualify for the knockout stages with three draws. While this game can be drawn and eventually head to penalties, only one can progress to the next round. A penalty shootout might be required, as Egypt are involved. Four of their last seven AFCON knockout ties have gone to a penalty shootout, including three of their four at the last tournament in January/February 2022. Every one of Egypt’s knockout stage matches at that tournament went to extra time before they eventually lost on penalties to Senegal in the final (4-2). Overall at AFCON 2021, Egypt had to play 801 minutes and 49 seconds of football – 97 minutes more than the eventual tournament winners, Senegal. Mohamed Salah was a key part of their run to the final that year, but he’ll be missing from this game following an injury suffered in the group stage against Ghana. He scored a 97th-minute penalty in their tournament opener versus Mozambique to secure a 2-2 draw. In fact, in all three of their group games (also 2-2 vs Ghana and 2-2 vs Cape Verde) Egypt were forced to come from a goal down to secure a point. Striker Mostafa Mohamed will be looking to keep up his record of netting in every match in this tournament – no Egyptian player has ever scored in their first four appearances at a single edition of an Africa Cup of Nations. While DR Congo also drew their three group games, they were lower-scoring affairs (four goals overall) than Egypt’s three matches (12 goals in total). They came from behind to draw 1-1 with both Zambia and Morocco before their final game against Tanzania ended 0-0 and saw them secure second place in Group F behind the Moroccans. Of the 16 teams remaining at AFCON 2023, only Namibia (1) scored fewer goals in the group stage than DR Congo (2), while they scored their two goals from an expected goals (xG) total of 5.0 – only Nigeria (-3.1) had a bigger underperformance in relation to their xG total in the group stage than DR Congo (-3.0). This will be the fifth Africa Cup of Nations encounter between Egypt and DR Congo, with the Pharoahs winning three of the previous four (L1). Egypt and DR Congo have met twice previously in the knockout rounds of the Africa Cup of Nations, each winning once (DR Congo won 3-2 in the semi-final in 1974 and Egypt won 4-1 in the quarter-final in 2006). On both occasions the winner of the tie went on to lift the trophy that year – DR Congo (as Zaire) in 1974 and Egypt in 2006. Their meeting in the AFCON 2019 group stage – a 2-0 win for the Egyptians, with Mohamed Salah scoring the second goal – was the last international played between the two nations. The Opta supercomputer predicts that Egypt will win this match inside 90 minutes and progress to the quarter-finals of AFCON 2023. They won 47.0% of the pre-match simulations run, compared to 28.1% by DR Congo. Before a ball was kicked in the tournament, Egypt were made the fifth-most likely team to win AFCON 2023 by the Opta supercomputer (8.5%) behind only Senegal (12.8%), Ivory Coast (12.1%), Morocco (11.1%) and Algeria (9.7%), who are already out of the tournament. DR Congo were given a 2.4% chance, but that’s increased following the exit of more favoured teams like the Algerians, Ghana and Tunisia. Here are the current tournament projections for both Egypt and DR Congo by the Opta supercomputer as things stand: Egypt: Mohamed Abou Gabal, Mohamed Sobhi, Mohamed El Shenawy, Ahmed El Shenawy, Ahmed Samy, Ali Gabr, Mohamed Hany, Mohamed Hamdy, Yasser Ibrahim, Mohamed Abdelmonem, Omar Kamal, Ahmed Abou El Fotouh, Ahmed Hegazy, Trézéguet, Mohamed Elneny, Marwan Attia, Mahmoud Hamada, Hamdi Fathy, Emam Ashour, Mohanad Lasheen, Zizo, Mohamed Salah, Koka, Mostafa Fathi, Kahraba, Mostafa Mohamed, Omar Marmoush.

2286,Afcon 2021: Hegazi ruled out for the remainder of Egypt’s campaign,"The Egyptian Football Association has confirmed that Ahmed Hegazi will play no further part in the remainder of their Africa Cup of Nations 2021 campaign due to injury. Hegazi, 31, ruptured the tendon of the adductor muscle during the Pharaohs’ 2-1 triumph over Morocco in a quarter-final match at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium in Yaounde. In the keenly contested showdown, the Al-Ittihad centre-back – who has featured prominently for the North Africans - picked up the injury before the half time break, and he was subsequently subbed off for Mahmoud Trezeguet – who scored the winner against the Atlas Lions. Hegazi’s injury setback is a blow to Carlos Queiroz’s men, who must negotiate their way past the Indomitable Lions on Thursday to reach the final of the tournament. “The x-rays conducted by Ahmed Hegazy, the national team player, showed that his injury is a rupture of the connective muscle tendons that requires treatment in a specialised centre, which means that he is unable to complete the tournament that ends on Sunday,” a tweet from EFA read. The former West Bromwich Albion star is yet another Egyptian player to pick up an injury in Cameroon after Mohamed El-Shennawy, Mohamed Abou-Gabal, Mahmoud Hamdy El-Wensh, Akram Tawfik, Ahmed Fetouh, and Hamdi Fathi. Coach Queiroz is expected to start Mohamed Abdelmoneim against the hosts and may partner either Ayman Ashraf or Mahmoud Alaa. Meanwhile, goalkeeper Abou-Gabal has expressed his readiness for the last four showdown against Toni Conceicao’s side. “It was a difficult match, but we prepared well for it. We respected the Moroccan team and studied them well. It’s a distinguished team and has the best African players in its ranks,” he told Elbotola. “I only have a minor muscle cramp and I’m on my way to playing, God-willing, in the semi-finals against Cameroon. “There were no intense fights, it was all is part of the game. The relationship between the [Egyptians and Moroocans] is strong and at the end of the day we are brothers. “Our winning spirit as well as our organisation as a collective helped us in yesterday’s meeting and helped us come back in the game.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/afcon-2021-hegazi-ruled-out-for-the-remainder-of-egypt-s/blta6d2f1107772aa60,Shina Oludare,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10973,Frank Schmidt and Tiny Heidenheim: A Real-life Football Manager Fairytale?,"FC Heidenheim are one match away from becoming only the second team after RB Leipzig to play in the fifth tier and the Bundesliga this century. Long-serving manager Frank Schmidt is the mind behind this small-town club’s remarkable ascension. As the story goes, Frank Schmidt was only supposed to be in charge for two matches when FC Heidenheim were playing fourth-tier football in the Oberliga Baden-Württemberg. Nearly 16 years on, he’s still there and potentially just one match away from leading them to the Bundesliga for the first time in their history. If that’s not romantic enough, add in the fact he was born in the town and raised in nearby Giengen. He even spent the final three years of his playing career at Heidenheim, including a season on the fifth rung of the German football ladder.    Now, they’re once again on the brink of the top flight. It’s the sort of rags-to-riches story every Football Manager player attempts to construct, taking over a small club, climbing through the divisions and firmly planting them on the map. Only, Heidenheim’s rise arguably goes beyond the imaginations of most – and, you know, it’s real.  Heidenheim head into the final round of 2. Bundesliga fixtures on Sunday second in the table and a point ahead of Hamburg. Beat Jahn Regensburg – who need a victory and a huge goal difference swing to avoid automatic relegation – and Schmidt will have achieved something few fans in 2007 could’ve envisaged happening in their lifetimes: taking the small-town club all the way to the Bundesliga. They could even pip Darmstadt – who’ve spent the week celebrating their promotion in the Balearic Islands – to the title.  “In Heidenheim, nobody talks about the Bundesliga, for God’s sake,” Schmidt said roughly 10 years ago. How times change.  Located roughly between Stuttgart and Munich, close to Baden-Württemberg’s border with Bavaria, Heidenheim an der Brenz isn’t exactly a hotbed of German football. But that makes their rise – and promotion, if they clear the final hurdle – even more remarkable.  According to the latest estimation (2021), the population of the town’s urban area is about 58,000. To put that into a wider European context, it’s smaller than Scarborough (61,000) in England, Dénia (60,000) in Spain and Olbia (61,000) on the Italian island of Sardinia.  Heidenheim wouldn’t be the smallest town represented in the big five leagues if they do manage to hold off Hamburg. Empoli has just 48,000 residents; Sassuolo has a population of 40,000. Even closer to home in Germany, Hoffenheim are based in Sinsheim (18,000).  But of course, Hoffenheim are a special case given their ascension through the divisions came after local billionaire businessman Dietmar Hopp started backing the club in the 1990s. Even though Heidenheim are sponsored by Voith, a technology company headquartered in the town who have a revenue of €4 billion, they haven’t had anything like the financial support of Hoffenheim, or RB Leipzig.  “Definitely, our biggest trump card is our team bond and our mentality,” Schmidt told Bundesliga.com in July 2020, the last time Heidenheim were in the promotion conversation so late in the season. Back then, they were ultimately unsuccessful in the promotion-relegation play-off, losing out to Werder Bremen on away goals after drawing 2-2 over the two legs.  This time they’ll hope to get the job done before it comes to that. But even if results do conspire against them, a second play-off appearance in four seasons will itself be a reminder of just how far Schmidt has taken Heidenheim.  After all, Red Bull-backed Leipzig are currently the only side to have played in both the fifth tier and Bundesliga this century, while Heidenheim had never even appeared in the DFB-Pokal main draw until the 2008-09 season, qualification coming thanks to their Württemberg Cup success the previous campaign. They won the same trophy four times on the trot between 2011 and 2014, with the latter triumph accompanied by the 3. Liga title, which secured their promotion to the second tier for the first time.   They’ve pretty much defied the odds ever since, only finishing in the bottom half twice, and never lower than 13th in the 2. Bundesliga. A narrow 3-2 defeat to Hertha Berlin in February 2016 denied them a spot in the DFB-Pokal semi-finals, and Heidenheim got to the quarter-finals again three years later, contesting a remarkable game with the mighty Bayern Munich.   Heidenheim were 2-1 up at the Allianz Arena at half-time. Thomas Muller, Robert Lewandowski and Serge Gnabry then seemed to have Bayern cruising, before Robert Glatzel completed a hat-trick with a quick-fire double to make it 4-4 in the 77th minute.   Hearts were broken by an 84th-minute Lewandowski penalty, but it was a performance that typified the mentality Schmidt has routinely spoken about over his time in charge, and that which has brought them back to the brink of the promised land.  Over the past few years, behind-the-scenes documentaries covering football clubs seem to have enjoyed a surge in popularity. While in some cases they feel like PR exercises, particularly when focusing on bigger teams, the series do lend a certain degree of insight to the average football fan.  Schmidt was a central part of such a documentary in 2013. The docuseries Trainer!, directed by Aljoscha Pause, followed the exploits of three up-and-coming German coaches over the course of a season, providing an intimate account of how the coaches spoke to their players and went about the daily responsibilities of football management. A director’s cut was shown at film festivals, and the series even made it to Netflix.  In the series, Schmidt’s personality shines through as a reflection of both his self-belief and humility.   “They can shout all they want, today we’re going to blow them away,” it shows him confidently telling his Heidenheim players as they prepare to enter the pitch. Then, in another section, he says: “I realise only a few people in Germany are able to pursue this career. That’s why I wake up every day thrilled that I can pursue this career.”  He is unapologetically himself. “Tough but sincere,” he described himself to SPOX just after the documentary’s release. Perhaps that’s been a key facet in his success because the players know where they stand.   But beyond that, one has to also consider how challenging and unusual it is to stay in such a job so long. Admittedly, it’s a different world to taking charge of, say, Bayern for more than 15 years, but over his time at the helm of Heidenheim, Schmidt has had to adapt his teams to play in new – and better – divisions, and he’s needed to bring them back from shattering disappointment, like in 2020.  As he approaches the 16th anniversary of his appointment, Schmidt is the longest-serving coach across the top two tiers in Germany, England, Spain, Italy and France. In fact, his closest rival in that regard is Atlético Madrid’s Diego Simeone, and he was hired more than three years after Schmidt.  Even in England’s lower divisions, Harrogate Town manager Simon Weaver is renowned for being in place a long time, but 14 years – almost to the day – still pales in comparison to Schmidt at Heidenheim.  The longevity of Schmidt shouldn’t be misconstrued as showing a lack of ambition, however. “I could imagine [in 2007] being successful with this club, so I didn’t have to think very long [about taking the job],” he said a decade ago. “My goal is also the first division.”   He was realistic but ambitious, adding: “I’ll put it this way: You shouldn’t limit yourself too much.”  Promotion has looked a genuine possibility for much of this season for Heidenheim. They lost only two league games before February and have been beaten at home – the modest 15,000-seater Voith-Arena – once all campaign in the 2. Bundesliga.   The 3-2 loss at Paderborn on 14 May put a spanner in the works, but Jan-Niklas Beste’s cool finish from Tim Kleindienst’s perfectly weighted cut-back after winning the ball in the box secured a 1-0 victory over Sandhausen – who were subsequently relegated – at the weekend to keep Heidenheim in the driver’s seat to go up with Darmstadt.  While there will undoubtedly be many neutrals around Europe hoping for fallen giants Hamburg to go up, much of the season to date suggests Heidenheim have the tools to see it out.  Not only have they kept a league-high 15 clean sheets – and a joint-club record in the second tier – but their 64 scored is the third most, with only Hamburg (69) and Paderborn (68) netting more. What sets Heidenheim apart and should provide additional confidence that they can get the job done is the fact their scoring haul far exceeds their expected goals (xG) by 19.5 (44.5 xG), which is the biggest differential in the division. It’s as if even the underlying numbers are saying, ‘you know what, let’s keep this fairytale alive’.   Sure, some might say they’ve been lucky, with their 5-2 win over Karlsruher in March raising some eyebrows given they managed just 0.9 xG, but perhaps the standard of their goals (and they netted some beauties on that occasion) was attributable to their confidence.  Kleindienst scored three in that game alone that showcased his wide-ranging skillset, blasting two exceptional finishes into the bottom corners from the edge of the box – one with either foot – and nodding in from a corner for a ‘perfect hat-trick’. The 27-year-old has been an essential part of Heidenheim’s promotion push, topping the scoring chart on 24 goals. With a cushion of five heading into the weekend, he is destined to become the club’s first player to end a 2. Bundesliga season as the division’s top scorer.  His nine headed goals is a league high as well and feeds into Heidenheim’s willingness to go direct. They rank third for most open-play crosses (504), top for long passes (2,460) and joint-third for direct attacks (63).   Heidenheim also embody the feistiness of Schmidt in their work rate off the ball, with their 294 high turnovers not bettered by any team in the league. Those situations have yielded eight goals, a tally only Hamburg (12) can trump.  Whether they can maintain that intensity and compete over a whole season in the Bundesliga is, of course, an entirely different kettle of fish. The squad will obviously need investment and understandably there’ll be concerns about them attracting a certain standard of player, but until this point Schmidt has made surpassing expectations a habit of Heidenheim with a largely homegrown squad – they’ve had at least 10 German players in every starting XI in the league this term.  In many ways Schmidt and Heidenheim shouldn’t have even got this close to the top tier, yet here we are.   Bundesliga or not, Schmidt’s already achieved the unthinkable.   Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

8764,Forgotten Man United talent scores against Real Madrid in 38 seconds — Bernabeu stunned,"Remember Largie Ramazani? He was a talented prospect in the Manchester United Academy before leaving permanently for Almeria in 2020. Almeria have been struggling in the bottom place in La Liga this season and are at risk of being relegated. During their game against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu this Sunday, no one expected them to cause trouble. Ramazani scored in the first 38 seconds for Almeria as the silence of a stunned Bernabeu graced the aftermath. Ramazani celebrated his goal with a series of somersaults, which also surprised some of the fans. This is the 22-year-old's third goal of the season before Almeria scored another one. Unfortunately, for the La Liga strugglers, Madrid found their footing in the second half and smashed three goals to win the game. That said, it's a moment worth cherishing for Ramazani after silencing an iconic stadium like the Bernabeu against the Spanish league leaders. Ramazani poses a clear threat and has been one of Almeria's most lethal threats - right from their promotion-winning campaign in 2021/22.",https://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-01-21-forgotten-man-united-talent-scores-against-real-madrid-in-38-seconds-bernabeu-stunned/,Meghna @ 1819,2024-01-21T17:54:00.000Z,Tribuna.com

5350,'Total bullsh*t!' - Furious Watzke denies Dortmund crisis meeting despite stunning 4-2 Europa League loss to Rangers,"Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has furiously denied that the club held a crisis meeting on Thursday night, despite the shocking nature of their 4-2 loss to Rangers. Dortmund were heavy favourites heading into the first leg of their round of 32 Europa League tie against the Scottish champions, but suffered a surprise defeat in front of their own fans. A post-match report from Sky Germany claimed that the result prompted BVB chiefs to hold late-night crisis talks, but Watzke has come out to set the record straight. The report stated that Dortmund head coach Marco Rose was summoned in front of the board, but the club's chief executive has told German news agency SID: ""There was no meeting of Hans-Joachim Watzke, [director of football] Michael Zorc, Marco Rose and [head of first-team football] Sebastian Kehl last night.  ""Total bullsh*t. There was no meeting."" Rose had earlier insisted that there are no communication issues in the BVB dressing room, but did also take full responsibility for his ideas not translating onto the pitch on the European stage. “In general I feel I can reach the guys,"" he told reporters after the final whistle. ""We talk in the meetings and I see them nodding their heads when we discuss things. “When we talk about certain plays, I see that they are understood. But the challenge is to put it out on the pitch and that’s my responsibility."" Rangers took the lead at Westfalenstadion thanks to a James Tavernier penalty in the 38th minute, and doubled their advantage moments later as Alfredo Morelos tapped home from close range. John Lundstram produced a brilliant long-range strike to make it three just after half-time and although Dortmund pulled a goal back swiftly thereafter through Jude Bellingham, the visitors were not to be denied. Rangers restored their three-goal cushion when Dan-Axel Zagadou turned a Morelos cross into his own net, leaving Rose with his head in his hands on the touchline. Dortmund were able to stay alive in the tie, with Raphael Guerreiro scoring arguably the goal of the game from 25 yards in the 82nd minute, but they will have a mountain to climb to reach the last 16 when they arrive at Ibrox on February 24.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/total-bullsht-watzke-dortmund-crisis-meeting-4-2-europa/blt3b8c48d36451aec6,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

2018,UEFA & Europol hold first conference to fight match-fixing in football,"UEFA and Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency, gathered on Tuesday in a conference to discuss methods to tackle match-fixing in football. It is the first time the agency and European football's governing body have come together to discuss cooperation in the fight against corruption in the sport. A total of 109 law enforcement, judicial authorities and officials from 49 football associations met in Den Haag as expert panels discussed the threats facing the game today and in the future. The officials met to discuss how to ""identify new ways to investigate and cooperate in cases related to sport corruption and match-fixing,"" a statement from Europol read. ""They discussed topics such as operational collaboration between law enforcement bodies and football integrity officers, and the early detection of suspicious betting patterns.   ""Prevention was also high on the agenda, with discussions focusing on new, recently adopted legal frameworks and existing tools designed to prevent match-fixing and facilitate information sharing."" UEFA’s Managing Director of Integrity and Regulations, Angelo Rigopoulos, said of the conference: “This first joint Europol-UEFA international conference is an important step forward in the fight against match-fixing, and sends out a strong signal that both organisations are here to pool their forces and do their utmost to minimise this phenomenon."" Meanwhile, Vincent Ven, UEFA’s Head of Anti-Match-Fixing, said there is an urgent need for the governing body to team up with law enforcement to tackle the issue of match-fixing. “Nowadays, more than ever before, European football and the law enforcement sector need to remain united and offer their mutual support in seeking to protect our popular sport from this scourge, by cooperating in joint activities, implementing common projects and exchanging information in the area of match-fixing,"" Ven said.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uefa-and-europol-hold-first-conference-to-fight-match-fixing/bltb0b3e30b97141df4,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

6624,Bayern Munich hit 47-year low as Bochum run riot in 4-2 thrashing & offer Dortmund Bundesliga hope,"Bayern Munich hit a 47-year low as Bochum ran riot in a 4-2 thrashing of Julian Nagelsmann's side on Saturday to offer Borussia Dortmund fresh hope in the Bundesliga title race. Bochum welcomed Bayern to Ruhrstadion as heavy underdogs, having suffered a 7-0 defeat against the German champions at Allianz Arena back in September. Thomas Reis' side produced a much-improved performance this time around to hand Bayern only their fourth loss of the 2021-22 campaign, scoring four goals in a stunning first half that left the visitors with a mountain to climb. Bayern looked to be on their way to victory when Robert Lewandowski bundled home with nine minutes on the clock, but Christopher Antwi-Adjei struck moments later to finish off a swift breakaway and level the scores. Bochum took a surprise lead in the 38th minute thanks to a Jurgen Locadia penalty and extended their advantage almost immediately after the restart as Cristian Gamboa fired an unstoppable shot past Sven Ulreich from the far corner of the box. 📽️ The twelfth of February, two thousand and twenty-two.

I can list a few virtues that we lacked here.  ""It doesn't have much to do with a plan or a tactic, but with the way you approach a game like this. We definitely have to question ourselves and also have to ask ourselves whether that's the mentality that FC Bayern embodies."" Bayern boss Nagelsmann echoed Kimmich's sentiments, with the door now open for Dortmund to cut his side's lead at the top of the table to six points with a win in their next game against Union Berlin.

9332,"'If I had only 5% of that': Miroslav Klose praises shooting technique of one striker, compares him to tennis players","Miroslav Klose, the legendary German player, says he would have scored even more World Cup goals if he had Harry Kane's fantastic finishing skills. The 45-year-old holds the record for the most World Cup goals, with 16 spread across four competitions, from 2002 to 2014.Quoted by Sport Bild, Klose said: ""I had predicted at least 20 to 25 goals for Harry [this season], but even that was too low.

3626,‘I could take two or three enemies out’ - Ukraine manager Petrakov on fighting Russia & fears they would shell players if football resumed,"Oleksandr Petrakov is a proud Ukrainian and opted not to flee following Russia's invasion, with the national football team's coach saying he could “take two or three enemies out”. At 64 years of age, and with his day job requiring full focus on sporting matters, Petrakov offered to join the fight against Vladimir Putin’s forces as shells began to drop from the sky. His family urged him to reconsider but, with normal life put on hold for the foreseeable future, staying put was the only option that the fiercely patriotic figure was prepared to consider. Petrakov told The Guardian of his decision to stand firm: “My family told me to go to western Ukraine but I refused. I said: ‘I am from Kyiv, I can’t leave’. “I didn’t think it would be correct as people have to defend and I can’t run. I thought, if they come to Kyiv I will pick up a weapon and defend my city.” He added: “I am 64 but I felt it was normal to do this. I think I could take two or three enemies out.” Petrakov has seen competitive football in Ukraine suspended indefinitely, but a World Cup 2022 play-off clash with Scotland is still due to take place in June. Preparations for that contest are proving tricky, with it virtually impossible to plan training sessions while the constant threat of military action hangs over the region – with plans to hold camps in the west of Ukraine being shelved for now. Petrakov said: “There is also shelling in western Ukraine. And if someone says that the national team training camp has started, the enemies could start shelling us. “These people are without morals, or principles, and we couldn’t risk our players. The Russians are not our brothers, they are the horde.” If Ukraine were to make their way past Scotland, then a play-off final against Wales would be lined up. Petrakov is still hoping to guide his nation to Qatar 2022, but admits that the odds are being stacked against his team. He said of the need to get his players – particularly those tied to Ukrainian clubs – match sharp before taking in such important fixtures: “We could play at Wembley, for example, against a London club. “It could be a good exhibition game, a response for the Ukrainian army, as well as preparatory work for the Scotland game. “We have to play because without the [practice] games, it would be very hard to get to play with Scotland.” Petrakov added on the prospect of ever lining up against Russia again at some point in the future: “I wouldn’t want this to happen while I am still alive. “I don’t [want] to shake hands with these guys … We have to build a great wall and do what we can do to separate from them.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/take-two-or-three-enemies-out-ukraine-manager-petrakov/blt76bc5339b4e99880,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

PSG were dumped out of the Champions League in stunning fashion yet again this year, falling 3-2 on aggregate against Real Madrid after a late-game collapse. The failure in Europe has made the club's Ligue 1 title hollow in the eyes of some fans, with supporters showing their frustrations with booing in the weeks since the club's Champions League exit. ""The objective is always in a club like Paris Saint Germain to win the Champions League,"" said the manager. ""The most important (thing) is to try to build something special.

""Of course for us it's not enough because we also want to win every single competition that we play."" There's plenty of uncertainty surrounding PSG, including with Pochettino's own future. Kylian Mbappe may also leave the club, with discussions ongoing regarding his future, but Pochettino believes there is more to come from PSG.

10682,Why Didn’t More Clubs Want to Sign Romelu Lukaku?,"He may have signed on loan for Roma, but there have been curiously few suitors for Romelu Lukaku this summer. Why wasn’t the Belgian more in demand? In the 2013 UEFA Super Cup, nine perfect penalties had been taken, with Bayern Munich leading Chelsea 5-4 in the shootout. Up stepped Romelu Lukaku, whose tame effort was saved by Manuel Neuer, securing the trophy for the German giants. Lukaku had recently returned from a loan spell at West Brom aiming to be part of José Mourinho’s plans. Four days after that penalty, he was loaned out to Everton.  The next line in stories like this is usually “and he never looked back”, but Lukaku’s career has almost been exclusively looking back, having had more reunions than a 90s US sitcom, though he has usually at least scored goals wherever he has gone. Ten years on from first parting with Mourinho, Lukaku is back under his charge at Roma, and not for the first time since that Super Cup defeat in Prague. However, with all due respect to Mourinho and the Giallorossi, it is curious that there wasn’t more competition for a striker with Lukaku’s impressive record. There have been plenty of clubs on the hunt for a striker this summer. Bayern eventually landed Harry Kane, Real Madrid lost Karim Benzema and hoped to replace him with Kylian Mbappé, only to settle for Joselu, Manchester United spent quite a bit of money on relatively unproven Rasmus Højlund, while Paris Saint-Germain opted to bring in Gonçalo Ramos. The so-called traditional number nine seems to be in vogue again thanks to the likes of Kane, Benzema, Robert Lewandowski and of course, Erling Haaland, and all the big clubs appear to want one. It therefore feels like something of a mystery as to why there was seemingly so little interest in Lukaku, who has been available all summer. Such has been the extent of overlooking the Belgian, even his own parent club, Chelsea, have reportedly been searching high and low for a striker despite having him on their books already. It may be that Mauricio Pochettino simply didn’t see Lukaku fitting with his style of play, but you would have thought Chelsea would take all the help they could get in front of goal. Last season, only four teams in the Premier League scored fewer than their 38 goals, and no-one underperformed their expected goals (xG) as much as Chelsea, whose xG in the league was 49.9, meaning they scored almost 12 goals fewer than they should have. In fact, they scored 20 fewer than Brentford, despite taking 76 more shots. Back in the days when Chelsea used to spend lots of money on hoovering up all the young talent they could (hmm…) they invested in a young Lukaku from Anderlecht. However, despite an impressive loan spell at West Brom in 2012-13, and an appearance in the aforementioned Super Cup, he was loaned and eventually sold to Everton. During his time on the blue half of Merseyside, Lukaku scored 87 goals in 166 games, which convinced Mourinho to reunite with the player for the first time, taking Lukaku to Manchester United in 2017. He made a good start to life at Old Trafford, scoring 27 goals in all competitions in his first season as United finished second in the Premier League and reached the FA Cup final. His second season is largely remembered as a failure though, leading to relative indifference to him being sold to Inter the following year. He still scored 15 goals despite being in and out of the team, and it had looked as though he might get back on track under then-interim boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer when he scored six goals in three games in late February/early March 2019, including a brace in the famous 3-1 UEFA Champions League last-16 second-leg victory at PSG. However, they would prove to be his final goals for the club before heading to Serie A. He excelled at Inter, scoring 54 times in 87 games in all competitions across two seasons, and 47 in 72 Serie A games, before moving back to Chelsea in another big-money transfer. Things started well back at Stamford Bridge, where Lukaku scored four goals in his first four games, before things dried up. His 15 goals in 44 games in all competitions in the 2021-22 campaign included just eight Premier League goals, and despite costing Chelsea around £100m, he was allowed to head back to Inter on loan just a year later. He didn’t have as much success as in his first spell there. It still wasn’t bad though, scoring 14 goals in 37 appearances, only 20 of which were starts. His numbers may not have been as impressive in the last couple of years, but we’re talking about a player who has accumulated around £280 million of transfer fees during his career and is only 30 years old. Lukaku still played a part as Simone Inzaghi’s side reached the Champions League final. However, that game perhaps summed up why some struggle to see him as the elite striker that his goal record suggests he is. Shortly after Rodri scored what would prove to be the winner for Manchester City in Istanbul, Federico Dimarco hit the crossbar with a looping header at the other end, before heading the rebound against Lukaku, who inadvertently blocked it. Hardly his fault but it would inevitably count against him, as would his own glorious chance to equalise in the 88th minute.  Robin Gosens headed a cross into the middle of the six-yard box, but Lukaku’s own header from point-blank range (below) hit Ederson’s leg and eventually made its way behind for a corner after rebounding off Rúben Dias. The chance had an xG value of 0.48. That reputation for not being clinical enough on the biggest stage had already been amplified by his notoriously wasteful performance off the bench for Belgium as they were eliminated from the group stage of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. In a game against Croatia his country needed to win, Lukaku came on at half-time and had a total of five shots, four of which were deemed to be big chances. He did not score any of them, including the one below that was given an xG of 0.62. Kevin De Bruyne crossed from the left and Dejan Lovren accidentally flicked the ball away from goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic, leaving Lukaku an open goal to head into, but he diverted his effort over the bar. In fairness, there had not been much time to react, and the situation was exacerbated by him missing further big chances later on that meant he ended the game with an individual xG of 1.73, and no goals to show for it as his country crashed out in Qatar. High-profile moments like those have arguably led to Lukaku’s reputation being undermined among football fans, but you would like to think those involved in the game would be able to see beyond these incidents. A player who scored 47 Serie A goals across the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons combined should not be defined by a few bad moments in big games. In fact, Lukaku has quite a few notable goalscoring accolades to boast. He has scored 75 goals in 108 games for Belgium in all competitions, and still has a chance of becoming only the fourth player ever to reach 100 international goals before he retires (after Ali Daei, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi). Back in club football, Lukaku has reached double figures in nine of the last 10 seasons in all competitions. Only Lewandowski (10) has done so more often in Europe’s big five leagues in that time. He is also one of only three players to score at least 14 goals in each of the last 11 seasons in all competitions from Europe’s big five leagues (along with Lewandowski and Wissam Ben Yedder). Lukaku is also in fourth place in a rather impressive list of players with the best minutes-per-goal ratios in Serie A since the 1994-95 season (min. 10 goals). His average of a goal every 132 minutes in Italy’s top flight is bettered only by Christian Vieri (108), the Brazilian Ronaldo (110) and Zlatan Ibrahimovic (127). That is presumably why most of the interest this summer in Lukaku has come from Italy. He reportedly and surprisingly turned down another return to Inter, seemingly in order to try and secure a move to Juventus. However, Juve fans went to the lengths of protesting the possible signing of the Belgian on the pitch at the Allianz Stadium during a pre-season friendly. After reportedly turning down big-money offers from the Saudi Pro League, Lukaku was finally handed a lifeline by a familiar figure, reuniting with Mourinho once again at Roma on a season-long loan deal. Lukaku has 43 goal involvements in 76 games under Mourinho across his time at Chelsea and Manchester United (33 goals, 10 assists). He linked superbly with Lautaro Martínez at Inter, so if Mourinho can pair him as effectively with Paulo Dybala, it could leave a lot of clubs wondering if they have missed a trick.

7324,"Trent, Sancho, Foden - How Forest boss Cooper helped develop England's golden generation","Nottingham Forest head coach Steve Cooper already has an incredibly long list of achievements.  He can boast of having won the Under-17s World Cup with England, playing a crucial role in the development of future internationals like Phil Foden, Jadon Sancho, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Conor Gallagher and Marc Guehi. While working at the Football Association (FA), he was charged with scouting Colombia and presenting his findings to Gareth Southgate ahead of England's World Cup clash with the South American side in Moscow. Before that, he become the most prominent coaching figure within Liverpool's academy, which produced world-class full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, who will play in a third Champions League final on Saturday.  Now, Cooper has led Nottingham Forest to Wembley for the first time in 30 years, putting them one win away from the Premier League. It would arguably be his greatest achievement yet. Indeed, as Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp made a point of saying after picking up his award for the LMA's manager of the year award, ""What Steve Cooper did at Nottingham is crazy."" He's not wrong. Forest, after all, were bottom of the Championship when Cooper took over in late-September. On Sunday, they will face Huddersfield in the promotion play-off final. After Brighton's Graham Potter, Cooper is arguably the most exciting British coach working in the game today. Like Potter, Cooper wasn't an exceptional footballer. He made it to the professional level but quickly retired to become a coach in Wrexham's academy.  It was while working in his native Wales that he was spotted by Liverpool just over the border in England and joined their academy as an Under-15s coach.  At Melwood, he would meet Pep Segura, who had been plucked out of Barcelona's La Masia by Rafael Benitez to overhaul the coaching philosophy at Melwood. Cooper remains in regular contact with his old mentor. Indeed, it was Segura who recommended him to Forest sporting director Kyriakos Dourekas. ""When I came to Liverpool, Steve quickly became my right-hand man,"" Segura told GOAL. ""My English isn’t perfect, but from the first day, he understood my idea and translated it for both the coaches and players.  ""I spoke with them all myself but Steve was important because he really sought to understand me and took the time to learn it every day.  ""He just wanted to learn and understand everything. During our time together, our conversations about the game went deeper and deeper. ""He could then explain my own idea better than I could to my coaches. After I left, he developed even more and worked with players like Trent Alexander-Arnold. ""What makes him a great coach is that he didn't play at a high level. He has learned to understand players through coaching.  ""He developed his ideas and philosophy and then put in place a coaching methodology that has great detail. ""He has worked with progressively older players and brings the British mentality with his jokes, personality and managing upwards within his institutions. He is a European-style coach with the British mentality."" The instant impact Cooper made at Forest came as no surprise to Dave Reddin either.  ""Steve was already an exceptional individual when he joined us,"" the FA's former head of team strategy and performance told GOAL.  ""He came with a clear idea of how he wanted to play the game. He had exceptional detail on how he saw the game. I think his detail on his game model, which evolved into the FA model, is second to none. That was the starting point.  ""Where Steve stands out is he showed incredible drive, curiosity and thirst for learning. Of all the coaches I was fortunate enough to spend time with over my six years, Steve was the one who would come to me most and talk, ask and challenge what I say. He would regularly sit with me and have a cup of tea to talk. ""He is very approachable. He takes time to get to know players, understand them and know them as people rather than just players. That’s the key that opens the lock for player development. ""I went to see him at Forest recently and he still has that connection with his players, his office door is open and the training ground is set up so players walk past his door.  ""He makes sure he has time in the morning just to talk with his players, not just on the training field, he likes to sit and talk with them.  ""There might be other coaches with a similar knowledge of the game but the differentiation might be how you relate to them, make them tick and get the best out of them."" Given he's held in such high esteem, it's remarkable to think now that Cooper was greeted with scepticism after leaving youth football to work in the senior game.  Indeed, after leaving his role at the FA take over at Swansea, whom he subsequently led to back-to-back appearances in the Championship play-offs, his appointment was viewed as a risk. ""There are coaches who were hugely undervalued in the system and Coops would be one of them,"" Reddin adds.  ""Swansea might have thought at the time that they were taking a chance on him but the people who knew him knew that they weren’t.  ""It was the perception from the outside that he was a gamble as he came from youth football, the media and social media were not kind to him. ""But with his quality, you see what’s possible. There are other Steve Coopers out there who are not being given a chance."" Cooper has since revived Forest, one of the English game's sleeping giants, in a matter of months and now the City Ground is one of the most vibrant stadiums in the country.  The former European champions can boast of a team full of talented youngsters like Brennan Johnson, James Garner and Djed Spence. Huddersfield finished one place, and two points, above Forest in the regular-season standings. So, winning at Wembley, and securing the £135 million ($170m) in extra revenue that comes with Premier League promotion will not be easy.  With Cooper in the dugout, though, they have every chance of pulling off.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/trent-sancho-foden-forest-boss-cooper-england-golden/bltff57e43a04abfded,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5246,Laporta: I put Barcelona above Messi & now I want him back,"Barcelona president Joan Laporta says he wants to bring Lionel Messi back to the club and is confident that the right strategy could see the Argentine end his career at Camp Nou. Messi left the Catalan side last summer in a free transfer because they could not afford to sign him to a new contract. Laporta, who recently expressed his desire to see the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner return, says he put the interests of the club ahead of Messi's when making the decision not to renew his contract, but he is determined to lure the icon back to La Liga. ""I did what I had to do in order to put the institution above the best player in our history,"" Laporta told CBS Sports. ""I have known Messi since he was a kid and I love Leo. I feel in moral debt to Messi. He's the best player in our history and I will do my best in order to ensure he can have the best ending of his career with a Barca shirt on. ""I would like to bring him back. It will not be easy but I think with the correct strategy we could do it. I think Messi has been the most important player in our history. OFFICIAL STATEMENT: Lionel Messi has left Barcelona 😱""Both parties deeply regret that the wishes of both the player and the club cannot be fulfilled.""🚨🚨🚨 pic.twitter.com/3zG8MAErZQ ""During a long period of success he was the leader. He was the one who excited our supporters. We will do our best to have Messi ending his career at Barcelona and being applauded by everyone."" He added: ""The end of Leo at Barcelona was not the best. It was a difficult time. We had to take a decision and put the club above the best player in our history. ""But I think we have to work now to have Messi end his career back wearing the shirt of Barcelona being applauded on every field that he plays. We will do our best to give him the ending he deserves."" Messi will be 36 by the time his contact with Paris Saint-Germain expires, in June 2023. It would seem highly unlikely that Barca would be able to afford to bring him back before that date, as a transfer fee would be required to release him from his current deal with the Ligue 1 champions. That said, a return on a free transfer, as much as Messi would command a huge salary, is not out of the equation, with Messi unlikely to retire from football at at the end of the 2022-23 campaign. Asked if Barca are already in the process of making an offer, Laporta said: ""Again, I am telling you this is a wish we have and I hope we can convert it to reality. We have a strategy to get him back to Barcelona. Barca loves Leo, the fans love Leo and I love him, too. I will do my best."" On whether Messi would have to take a pay cut to seal a move back to Camp Nou, Laporta added: ""We will see. ""Now is not the best moment to talk about this because he's a PSG player and has one more year on his contract and we must respect this."" If Barcelona pull this off 💭 pic.twitter.com/IntytyRKIz Barca coach Xavi says he would be happy to see the 35-year-old back at Camp Nou, but admits they would have to wait until his contract at PSG ends next summer before they can make a move for him. ""I already said at the time. It is a utopia to focus on Leo. I wish the Messi era had not ended,"" he said. ""I think he deserves a second chance, a last chance, but that's next year. He has a contract. I would like to. Yes.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/laporta-barcelona-above-messi-now-want-him-back/blta809864f78ad5825,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

At the other end of the table, the fight to stay in the top-flight and avoid relegation to the Championship is as close as ever.

5941,UEFA suspend Bodo/Glimt manager Knutsen and Roma coach Santos after Conference League altercation,"UEFA have provisionally suspended Bodo/Glimt manager Kjetil Knutsen and Roma goalkeeping coach Nuno Santos after their alleged alteration in the Conference League last week. Bodo/Glimt earned a 2-1 victory over Roma in the first leg of their quarter-final thanks to a late winner from Hugo Vetlesen, but the contest was overshadowed by a dispute in the tunnel after the final whistle. Knutsen was accused of attacking Santos by Roma captain Lorenzo Pellegrini, but Bodo/Glimt claimed that the former Leeds keeper was the provocateur in their subsequent statement to police. UEFA have confirmed suspensions for Knutsen and Santos while beginning a full investigation into the incident. A statement from European football's main governing body says the pair are facing potential punishment for “conduct which is insulting or otherwise violates the basic rules of decent conduct”. Both men will definitely miss the second leg of the tie at Stadio Olimpico on April 14 as they wait for UEFA's final ruling. Bodo/Glimt released their own statement in response to UEFA on Monday night, confirming their intention to appeal. ""We are surprised and shocked by UEFA's decision,"" the statement reads. ""We will appeal, and will work on it throughout the evening. Beyond that, we currently have no comments."" Knutsen has admitted that the whole episode has made him question whether or not to continue his coaching career. ""It is on a level that I have considered whether I should continue with this,"" he said. ""It is so far from my, the club's and Norwegian football's values. ""Such things can make me want to do something completely different. For me, the most important thing is to be able to see myself in the mirror.  ""If it's at the expense of it, I have to consider whether it's actually worth it.

4327,"‘Children are dying, we need to stop this war’ - Shevchenko makes powerful statement as he reveals his mother & sister are still in Ukraine amid Russia invasion","Andriy Shevchenko has issued a powerful statement calling for the end to a “real war” between Ukraine and Russia, with the AC Milan legend pointing out that “children are dying” and members of his own family remain in Kyiv. The former Chelsea striker, who spent five years as head coach of his country’s national team between 2016 and 2021, is among those being forced to watch on from afar as Vladimir Putin has sanctioned an invasion of his homeland. He admits that football “doesn’t exist for me any more”, with the 45-year-old looking for more decisive action to be taken by nations around the world in a bid to stop political unrest from spiralling out of control. Shevchenko has told Sky Sports: “I’m so proud to be Ukrainian. It’s a very difficult moment for my country, my people, my family. “My mum and sister are in Kyiv at the moment, and terrible things have happened there. People dying, children dying, missiles pointing into our houses. “We need to stop this war, we need to find a way to stop the war.” He added, having tried to convince his family to join those fleeing Kyiv: “My mum and sister, like most of the Ukrainian people, are refusing to leave, they’re staying put to fight, for our freedom, for our soul. “We’re a united people, and at this moment a country united. There’s a lot of help around; families try to share food with the soldiers, to help the troops. “It’s one of the more difficult moments in the history of Ukraine, but people are really united, because we want freedom, and to defend our homes. “We have refugees, we need humanitarian aid. We need medical support, food support. It feels like I can do a lot here, and I will do.” Sanctions are being imposed on Russian financial and political institutions by governments and businesses around the world, with FIFA and UEFA stripping the country of Champions League final hosting rights while suspending their national team from World Cup play-offs and domestic sides from European competition. Shevchenko said of efforts to restore peace as soon as possible: “It's a great reaction from the institutions like UEFA and FIFA to make the right decision. “I don't think it's a difficult decision. When you attack a country, when you start to send in bombs and soldiers; it's not a conflict, it's a real war. “When the war has not stopped, I think it's the right decision not to allow any Russian athletes to participate in any sporting event. “Football doesn't exist for me any more. I don't think about it. It's not the time for that. I'm not watching anything, any sport, anything. “All my concentration, when I wake up, I think about how I can help my country, what I can do. I've started to call my parents, my friends, get updates on what's going on in Ukraine. “For me, this is my field, this is my concentration now.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/children-dying-stop-war-shevchenko-mother-sister-ukraine/bltb8160a0fd77e212d,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5987,Rice accuses referee of 'corruption' after West Ham crash out of Europa League following Cresswell red card,"Declan Rice accused referee Jesus Gil Manzano of “corruption” after West Ham’s Europa League semi-final defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt. Footage has emerged of a furious Rice confronting the official in the tunnel at Deutsche Bank Park on Thursday evening, where the Hammers were beaten 1-0 to exit the competition 3-1 on aggregate. The Premier League side had Aaron Cresswell sent off early on for an elbow that was initially punished with a yellow card before Manzano changed his mind after reviewing the incident on the VAR monitor. It is unclear whether the clip, released by FoxSportsMX, is taken at full time or half time, but Rice is clearly angry at some of Manzano’s decision-making. “Ref, it’s so poor,” Rice shouted. “All night, it’s so bad. How can you be that bad? Honestly, you’ve probably been f***ing paid. F***ing corruption.” Speaking to BT Sport shortly after the game, a more composed Rice said: “The sending off was probably a sending off looking back at it but some of the other decisions were poor tonight. “Nothing seemed to go for us. The ref seemed to make every decision go for them. In the end, when you've got someone who is against you, you can't really do much.” On a frustrating evening all round for West Ham, boss David Moyes could face a UEFA charge after he volleyed ball in anger and nearly hit a ball boy. Moyes was sent off for the incident before apologising after the game.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rice-accuses-referee-corruption-west-ham-europa-league/blt385e01f06bda5d37,Tom Mallows,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10566,Celtic vs Lazio: Prediction and Preview,"With Group E looking like one of the most open sections in the 2023-24 UEFA Champions League, we look ahead to Wednesday’s clash at Celtic Park with our Celtic vs Lazio prediction and preview. It has been a long time since Celtic’s supporters were able to toast a UEFA Champions League victory. Having suffered a meek 2-0 defeat at Feyenoord on Matchday 1, the Bhoys are winless in 11 games in Europe’s premier club competition, drawing two and losing nine since beating Anderlecht in September 2017. They are looking to set that record straight on Wednesday, but a tough task awaits them against last season’s Serie A runners-up Lazio. The Scottish champions made a poor start to their latest European campaign, with the second-half dismissals of Gustaf Lagerbielke and Odin Holm compounding their misery. That defeat in Rotterdam means Celtic have now won just one of their last 22 Champions League matches (five draws, 16 defeats). Few positives could be taken from the underlying numbers, either. No Champions League side managed fewer than Celtic’s eight touches in the opposition area across MD 1, while only Union Berlin (0.24) and Newcastle United (0.28) amassed less than their 0.3 expected goals (xG). Brendan Rodgers has won just two of his 19 total Champions League matches with Liverpool and Celtic (five draws, 12 losses). None of the 87 managers to reach 20 games in the competition have posted fewer than three wins (Viktor Goncharenko and Rudi Garcia both have three). Rodgers’ team are faring better on the domestic front, maintaining their unbeaten start to the Scottish Premiership season with Saturday’s dramatic 2-1 win at Motherwell, courtesy of Matt O’Riley’s 97th-minute strike. O’Riley’s seven goal involvements (five goals, two assists) are the most of any player in the Scottish top flight this term. Luis Palma also scored from the bench on Saturday, and he will hope to return to Celtic’s lineup in support of Kyogo Furuhashi and Daizen Maeda. Defender Cameron Carter-Vickers is still injured, so Liverpool loanee Nat Phillips could replace the suspended Lagerbielke. Lazio, meanwhile, fought back from a goal down to earn a memorable draw against Atlético Madrid on MD 1. Eleven different Biancocelesti outfielders attempted a shot before Ivan Provedel — in the 95th minute — became the fourth different goalkeeper to score a Champions League goal, following in the footsteps of Hans-Jörg Butt (three between 2000 and 2009), Sinan Bolat (December 2009) and Vincent Enyeama (September 2010). Provedel’s header stretched Lazio’s unbeaten run in Champions League group stage action to seven games (two draws, five draws). They have only enjoyed a longer streak in 1999-00, when they avoided defeat in their first eight such games in the competition (including a second group phase). Domestically, however, Lazio are struggling. They’ve endured their worst start to a league campaign since 2007-08, taking seven points from as many games. They were distinctly second-best in Saturday’s 2-0 defeat at Milan, which provoked something of a civil war at the club. Tensions between coach Maurizio Sarri and president Claudio Lotito are reportedly high after the former criticised Lazio’s squad, claiming he was having to “make do” after they failed to land his preferred transfer targets. Lazio have struggled at both ends of the pitch, only averaging a goal per game in Serie A and allowing opponents to accumulate 7.4 xG from open play – more than all but four teams. Manuel Lazzari, Matías Vecino, Danilo Cataldi and Daichi Kamada all started on the bench on Saturday and could come in here. Captain Ciro Immobile was also limited to a substitute role after sustaining a knock, but he could take Valentín Castellanos’ place in attack if fully fit. Celtic are defending a 100% record against Lazio, having won both of their previous meetings in the UEFA Europa League in 2019. Christopher Jullien’s late header handed the Hoops a 2-1 victory in Scotland in October 2019, and they sealed qualification from Group E by winning by the same scoreline at the Stadio Olimpico the following month, with James Forrest and Olivier Ntcham netting. More generally, Lazio have failed to win any of their last 11 European matches against British teams (four draws, seven defeats) since a 2-1 Champions League victory at Chelsea in March 2000. Lazio have lost three of their four away games in Serie A this term, beating Napoli but going down to Lecce, Juventus and Milan, and they have also struggled on the road in this competition lately. They have only won one of their last 16 away Champions League games (five draws, 10 losses), with their sole victory in that run coming at Beşiktaş back in September 2003. Might their poor travelling record be counteracted by Celtic’s dire home form in Europe, however? The Bhoys are winless in their last 10 home Champions League games (two draws, eight defeats), going 15 such matches without a clean sheet. Only four teams have ever endured a longer run without a home win in the competition – FCSB (13, 1996-2013), Lille (13, 2006-2021), Club Brugge (12, 2016-2020) and Spartak Moscow (11, 2001-2006). The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off on Wednesday night, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta supercomputer is siding with the visitors here – but only just! Lazio were victorious in 40.1% of 10,000 match simulations conducted before kick-off, with Celtic winning 34.5%. The likelihood of a draw stands at 25.4%. In our overall tournament projections, these teams are outsiders to progress from Group E. While Lazio qualified in 42.86% of group-stage simulations, Celtic are given just an 11.11% chance of a last-16 spot. Atlético (78.35%) and Feyenoord (67.68%) are instead favoured to advance.

9226,'And I let go of myself': Hazard explains arriving at Madrid pre-season visibly overweight,"Speaking in his first major interview since retirement, Eden Hazard has reflected on his time at Real Madrid and his struggles in the capital of Spain.The struggles started early - the day the Belgian arrived to the Whites' pre-season five kilos overweight back in June 2019. When asked why that happened, Eden explained:""With Chelsea I'd just finished one of the best and tough seasons of my career. I said to myself, 'now that I'm at Real Madrid, this is perhaps the last vacation I'll be able to take…' and I let go of myself like I let go of myself every summer,"" he told L'Equipe.""Seven years in England, without a break at Christmas, giving everything, so when I have three or four weeks of vacation, 'don't bother me', barbecues, rosé wine all that.""And that's what allowed me to reset myself to start again. But at Madrid it went wrong and that's it.""""They say I was a slacker. But I haven't spent 16 years [as a professional] without training.

10220,Do Arsenal Really Need a New Striker?,"After scoring just once from 61 shots across their last three games, many are shouting for Arsenal to sign a new striker. They scored 88 goals in the Premier League last season, though, so could the answer be closer to home? Sunday felt like it summed up Arsenal’s recent struggles. Their FA Cup third round tie against Liverpool saw them create plenty of chances, press well, force mistakes and do almost everything right, except putting the round thing into the rectangular thing. As a result, Mikel Arteta’s men lost 2-0 and another opportunity to secure silverware was waved off into the distance. It was the latest in a recent run of games that has seen Arsenal struggle to find the net and pay the price for it. Their cup defeat to Liverpool made it consecutive home losses by a margin of 2+ goals for the first time since May 2009 (3-1 vs Manchester United, 4-1 vs Chelsea), having also been beaten 2-0 by West Ham in the Premier League on 28 December. It made it one win in seven in all competitions for Arsenal – their fewest wins over a seven-game period under Arteta – and three defeats on the bounce, having also lost 2-1 at Fulham on New Year’s Eve. In fact, across those three games, Arsenal have scored just one goal from 61 shots, and a total expected goals (xG) value of 6.0, meaning they scored five fewer goals than they should have based on the quality of the opportunities created. Therefore, the predictable shouts from pundits and Arsenal fans alike at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday was for the club to sign a striker. Ivan Toney, Dominic Solanke, bring Ian Wright out of retirement; the number of (not entirely serious) solutions that involve new faces being brought to north London are almost endless. When told that the fans had been demanding a new striker during the game, Arteta said in his post-match press conference: “At the moment it does not look realistic. What my job is, and what we have to do is improve our players and try to get better results with the players we have. “What I beg from the supporters is that they are behind the team like they have been in difficult moments.” And as disheartening as it might be for Arsenal fans who want to see a shiny new striker arrive in the January transfer window, Arteta is right. His job is to improve the players he has, the same ones who collectively scored 88 goals in the Premier League last season, 13 more than the third most (Liverpool) and only six fewer than champions Manchester City, who had Erling Haaland. While Toney or Solanke might add goals, it’s a bit too easy to assume Arsenal will otherwise keep playing exactly the same way and creating the number of chances they are now if they were to add a different type of striker. We observed in November that Arsenal had become a little less extravagant going forward but a little more robust overall, though that has deserted them somewhat in recent games. As well as scoring just once from 61 attempts since Christmas, they have conceded six times from 33 shots faced and an overall xG against of 3.3. From an attacking sense, it could simply be that Arsenal have reverted to the mean. Last season in the Premier League they scored their 88 goals from an xG of 72.3, scoring about 16 goals more than they should have. This season they have scored 37 from an xG of 37.2, almost exactly what they should have. If you just look at non-penalty goals, though, things do look a bit more concerning. Arsenal have already scored twice as many penalties in the Premier League this season (six) as they did in the whole of last season (three), meaning they have scored just 31 non-penalty goals in their 20 games. That’s an average of 1.55 non-penalty goals per game, compared to last season’s 2.24. Arsenal’s chance creation hasn’t really been impacted, though. In fact, they are averaging slightly more shots per game this season (16.3) in the league than they did last season (15.6), and their average xG per game is only very narrowly lower (1.86) than last season (1.9). So it’s not as if they are creating significantly lower quality chances, they just simply aren’t converting them as often. We looked only last week at how giving Bukayo Saka a rest could be a solution for the Arsenal boss, though yet again it was the England man who started against Liverpool and Gabriel Martinelli was the one who dropped to the bench, with Reiss Nelson coming in. Arteta was able to rely on both Saka and Martinelli regularly finding the net last season, scoring 14 and 15 Premier League goals respectively, while Martin Ødegaard also hit 15. All three have seen their efficiency in front of goal reduce considerably in 2023-24, though. Saka’s 14 league goals in 2022-23 came with a conversion rate of 15.7%, while he scored seven of his 10 big chances (70%). This season, Saka has a conversion rate of 12.2%, and though he has already had more big chances than he did in the whole of last season (11), he has only scored four (36.4%). Martinelli’s drop is far greater, going from a 19% shot conversion rate last season in the Premier League to 6.1% this, scoring just twice from 33 shots, and he has only had three big chances (scoring one), having had 16 last season (scoring 10). Ødegaard has slipped from a 16.1% conversion rate to just 10.3% but has scored two of his three big chances. Leandro Trossard was an interesting addition from Brighton last January, and he provided an outstanding 10 assists in the second half of the 2022-23 Premier League season, though he scored just once from 17 shots. The Belgian wide forward has three league goals this season, but just one assist. Whether that is down to a change in Trossard’s game or just a result of poor finishing from his teammates is up for debate, but he is another attacking player whose output has noticeably dipped. The main debate seems to be around the central strikers, however. Gabriel Jesus was hailed as an important addition when he arrived from Man City in the summer of 2022, and his impact last season was impressive. He scored 11 league goals in 26 games and had a respectable shot conversion rate of 14.3%, while he had the highest xG of all of Arsenal’s forwards (14) and also produced six assists. This season he’s converted just 9.4% of his shots, with three goals in 15 games from an xG of 4.84. After allowing Folarin Balogun to leave for Monaco in the summer, Eddie Nketiah is probably the closest Arsenal have to the out-and-out goalscoring number nine the fans are clamouring for, but he had a conversion rate of just 9.8% in the Premier League last season, and put away only four of his 15 big chances (26.7%). He’s actually upped his overall conversion rate to 15.6% this season and scored three of his seven big chances (42.9%). Arteta started Nketiah in nine of Arsenal’s first 11 Premier League games this season but has given him just one start since Jesus returned, which was last time out in the defeat at Fulham. That may be primarily due to Jesus being more creative than Nketiah last season, with the Brazilian averaging 1.35 chances created per 90 minutes compared to Nketiah’s 0.76. That gap has widened this season, with Jesus creating 1.63 chances per 90 to Nketiah’s 0.65. Kai Havertz’s numbers are skewed by the fact he has played several games in midfield since arriving from Chelsea, but he has scored just four goals from 19 Premier League games and is the only attacking player to start in the league this season and average under two shots per 90 (1.92). The Germany international tried to impose himself when he started up front against Liverpool on Sunday, having six shots, the most by an Arsenal player in an FA Cup game without scoring since Olivier Giroud against Hull City in the 2014 final (six). Havertz hit the target with only two of them, though, while he completed 12 of just 18 passes and won only two of 14 duels contested. Having said that, Nketiah came on in the 81st minute and had just one touch of the ball. In fact, of every Arsenal player to have featured in at least five Premier League games this season, no-one has averaged as few touches per 90 as Nketiah’s 32.7. He’s the only outfield player to average fewer touches than goalkeeping pair David Raya (37.6) and Aaron Ramsdale (32.8). Let’s compare with Ivan Toney’s Premier League numbers from last season. The Brentford striker scored 20 goals in 33 games, six of which were penalties, with an overall shot conversion rate of 21.3%, averaging 41 touches per 90 (of Arsenal forwards only Nketiah has averaged fewer this season), while also scoring 17 of his 33 big chances (51.5%). You can therefore understand why there is such a clamour for someone of his profile at Arsenal. When it feels like nothing will go in for you, the natural reaction is to look to someone who has history of putting away a healthy amount of his chances. It does seem like having a striker of that type would require a compromise elsewhere, though, especially given how different Brentford play to Arsenal. Looking at last season’s stats in the Premier League off the ball, Jesus averaged 1.5 tackles per 90, more than twice as many as Toney’s 0.7, while the former Man City man made 13 pressures in the final third per 90 (Toney 9.6) 2.7 pressures in the final third resulting in a turnover per 90 (Toney 1.8), and 1.2 pressures in a team press resulting in a turnover per 90 (Toney 0.6). That’s not to say Toney couldn’t adapt, but doing so could also impact on his output in front of goal. Arsenal would also have the issue of finding the significant money it would take to pry Toney from the Gtech Community Stadium, which would likely be the case for any other striker of the required level in the January transfer window. Arteta is right that he needs to solve this issue himself. That’s what the best managers do, and while it’s easier said than done, the fact of the matter is that he has a group of players available to him who scored more than enough goals only last season. Find a way to get the likes of Saka, Martinelli and Ødegaard firing again, and all of a sudden, sticking with what he knows makes a lot more sense. Enjoy this?

5934,The month Liverpool's title dreams ended? Salah penalty miss sums up Reds' doomed December,"He is human after all, then. Mohamed Salah has won Liverpool enough points down the years, so he can be forgiven the occasional off-night. And he and his Reds team-mates certainly had one in Leicester on Tuesday night. We have all been wondering how Jurgen Klopp’s side would handle January, but it is December which looks like it could cost them. After dropping five points in their last two Premier League games, their title chances are hanging by a thread. The gap to Manchester City is now six points, and could be extended to nine if the reigning champions win at Brentford on Wednesday. Liverpool would have a game in hand, but it still looks - and feels - like it would be a tall order to reel in Pep Guardiola’s side from here - especially when the Reds’ next fixture is a trip to Chelsea. They were poor here, beaten 1-0 at the King Power Stadium courtesy of a second-half strike from Ademola Lookman, the Leicester substitute and, of all things, a former Everton player. Brendan Rodgers’ side, smashed for six at the Etihad Stadium on Boxing Day, looked revived here. The win lifts them into the top half of the table. Liverpool, will rue the defending which allowed Lookman to run through and score just three minutes after his introduction. Certainly Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold will not fancy watching that particular clip back. Nor will Salah want to revisit the moment, 16 minutes in, when he had the ball on the penalty spot and the game at his feet. The Egypt international had won the spot kick himself, tripped by a panicking Wilfred Ndidi, and would have felt confident having netted his last 15 Premier League penalties. But for once, his radar was off. Kasper Schmeichel guessed right, dived right and made the save. Salah still might have made amends, but headed the rebound against the bar and then prodded a third attempt wide. The grimace said it all. As did Sadio Mane’s when, a few minutes before Lookman’s winner, the Senegal star was played clean through by Diogo Jota. He was inside Timothy Castagne and saw the whites of Schmeichel’s eyes. The goalkeeper went left, Mane went right, but the ball flew over the bar. On the sideline, Klopp celebrated prematurely before correcting himself. Mane's, like Salah's, would prove to be a costly miss. Soon after, Lookman did his thing and there was to be no way back.

Leicester, tired but highly motivated after last week's Carabao Cup shocker against the Reds' second string, ran themselves into the ground, their fans celebrating blocks and clearances like goals - when they were not taunting the away supporters with some more than unsavoury chants about poverty, that is. Liverpool huffed and puffed, taking 21 shots and forcing a dozen corners. The sight of Alisson Becker in the penalty area for the last of those said it all; desperate times, desperate measures. There was to be no heroic contribution from the Brazilian this time, though. Liverpool ended 2021 as they started it, beaten 1-0 away from home. This was their first time they have failed to score in a game since April, and their first blank on the road since that January loss at Southampton, which was every bit as frustrating as this one. It looks like it could be a long way back from here. City’s form is ominous and Liverpool’s is fading. They remain in the race, but only just. December has not been kind to the men from Anfield. They now have to hope January is a lot better to them than it was last time.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-title-dreams-ended-salah-penalty-miss-doomed/bltf1e2b27f35ee930b,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5923,Nunez & Salah to the rescue as Liverpool battered & bruised by Mitrovic in Fulham draw,"WHAT HAPPENED? Fulham were denied a shock win over Liverpool on the opening weekend of the Premier League season as two goals from Aleksandar Mitrovic were cancelled out by Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Fulham have every reason to celebrate after securing an unlikely point against Jurgen Klopp's side, with the German furious with the below-par Reds, who needed new signing Nunez to bail them out.

2200,Southampton make transfer approach for Chelsea's Anjorin after Lokomotiv Moscow loan cut short,"Southampton are in talks to sign Tino Anjorin from Chelsea after he cut short his loan at Lokomotiv Moscow, following Ralf Rangnick’s exit to join Manchester United. The 20-year-old is currently in London taking the last steps to overcome a broken metatarsal sustained in Russia. The Blues had previously inserted a £17m ($20m) option to buy on their loan deal with Lokomotiv and could accept a similar price for the homegrown talent. If the Saints can’t sign Anjorin in January, they will try again in the summer. Chelsea will, instead, likely send him on loan to a Championship club, with several teams already enquiring about the attacking midfielder’s status. EXCL: Southampton are in talks with Tino Anjorin over a permanent move. - Chelsea previously valued him a £17m at Lokomotiv Moscow, but he has now cutshort his loan - If he stays, Saints will try again in the summer & he'll go on loan to the Championship. #CFC Thomas Tuchel is an admirer of the homegrown star who was seen as the best in his generation but is unable to guarantee first-team minutes with so many attackers in his squad. Russia is no longer seen as the best enviornment for Anjorin after Rangnick was poached by Man Utd. The sporting director turned head coach had been the driving force behind the transfer in the first place. Hasenhuttl’s strategy is increasingly talking about diving into the big six academies and giving a shot to the best young players in the Premier League. Southampton have already attracted the likes of Tino Livramento and Dynel Simeu from Chelsea. Meanwhile, they have given ex-Tottenham defender Kyle Walker-Peters an important role in the first team. There’s also Nathan Tella from Arsenal and Thierry Small from Everton. They aren’t hiding their strategy with the Austrian coach coming out and saying it in the clearest terms possible. ""Young players that can't make it at Chelsea or Man City are welcome here,” Hasenhuttl said earlier in January. “We will give them the platform and want to create new stars."" They have also gone public about their interest in signing Armando Broja who is currently on loan at St Mary's from Chelsea. “Sure [we can sign him], he likes it here,” Hasenhuttl said. “He loves it here. It would be great if he was our player, he wants to be with us I think, you can feel this in every moment. “The fans love him meanwhile, good.” The Albania international will top the club's shortlist but he is likely to wait until the end of the season to see if Tuchel will give him a chance in west London. West Ham are also thought to be one of a number of other clubs that have made their interest known in the 20-year-old.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/southampton-transfer-approach-chelsea-anjorin-lokomotiv/bltae152c0aeefb45cc,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7419,Man Utd move ahead in Martinez transfer battle as Arsenal interest cools,"Manchester United are stepping up their attempts to land Lisandro Martinez and are now in ongoing discussions with Ajax over a deal for the Argentina international. Arsenal have also been interested in the defender this summer, but have been unable to agree a fee. Both Premier League clubs have already seen multiple bids rejected by Ajax for the 24-year-old, who has spent the past three years in Amsterdam following his move from Defensa y Justicia in 2019. Ajax have yet to accept a bid from any team for Martinez, despite both Arsenal and Manchester United tabling firm offers. The Dutch champions are believed to want around €50 million (£42.4m) for the defender, who can operate at centre-back or left-back. Neither club has reached that figure, with Arsenal’s most recent offer totalling around €40 million (£35m), plus a further €5m (£4.3m) in add-ons. United matched that bid and while it was also rejected, sources have confirmed to GOAL that United are the club actively pushing to find an agreement with Ajax. Whilst Arsenal are not believed to have formally pulled out of the running for Martinez, it is United who are now in regular contact with the Eredivisie giants in a bid to strike a deal. And after holding firm for weeks, it is now believed Ajax are willing to find an agreement for the defender. Martinez is adamant that he wants to move to the Premier League this summer and has asked Ajax to let him leave. He has urged the Dutch outfit to reach an agreement, with the defender reiterating his desire to move to England during a meeting in Amsterdam last week. Sources close to the player have always felt United could have the advantage over Arsenal in the pursuit, due to the defender’s relationship with Eric ten Hag - who was his coach in Amsterdam before his move to Old Trafford earlier this year. But Martinez has never ruled out a switch to Arsenal and has been impressed with the vision the north London club have relayed to his representatives.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-martinez-transfer-arsenal-interest-cools/blt76565fc224661a37,Charles Watts,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6399,Manchester United keeper Henderson: I'd be playing in League One if I hadn't gone on loan,"Dean Henderson says he would never have made it to the Manchester United senior team had he not been sent out on loan to experience football in the lower leagues.

The 25-year-old says his loans to Stockport, Grimsby, Shrewsbury Town and Sheffield United were integral to his development and the reason he got to where he is today.  ""I remember going [to Stockport] when I was a young kid, "" he told Manchester United's website.  ""To be fair, I absolutely loved it. It was tough, really hard, as a young boy. Going into that division was an eye-opener for me. I’m thankful for the opportunity given to me by the manager at the time, Jim Gannon, for sticking by me because I didn’t play too well. ""I was really getting smashed on crosses, kicking the ball 80 yards on to the striker’s head and, if I didn’t do so, the manager was screaming at me from the touchline. It stood me in good stead and I really appreciate the opportunity they gave me. “I think my debut, in the first five minutes, their big striker said: ‘Stick it on the goalie, he’s pooping himself’. I thought: ‘Right mate, I’m coming for this’. So I made my mind up I was coming for it and, before I even got there, he flicked it over my head. These are the things you learn and move on. It was great for me. “It's why I'm sitting here today. If I didn't [go out on loan], I'd probably be in League One now, just going out on my first loan. I fought for it and I stand by it, the best decision of my life."" Henderson made his senior debut for United in September 2020 and went on to make 13 Premier League appearances that season.

The Sweden international winger has quickly become a fan favourite at Spurs, with another attacking weapon being added to Antonio Conte’s ranks alongside the more established duo of Harry Kane and Heung-min Son. Kulusevski has adjusted seamlessly to the demands of life in the Premier League and now has his very own terrace chant. How does that tune go? GOAL takes a look… The song is sung to the tune of the ABBA track 'Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)' and goes: There’s not a soul out there,No one to hear my prayers,Gimme, gimme, gimme a ginger from Sweden,He came from Juventus,And he plays on the wing. Gimme, gimme, gimme a ginger from Sweden,Number 21,His name is Kulusevski. Check out a video of Tottenham fans singing the song below. Spurs fans new song for 🇸🇪Kulusevski is phenomenal content. “Gimme gimme gimme a ginger from Sweden!” pic.twitter.com/FA0k8Fq7uA It is fitting that Swedish supergroup ABBA have been chosen to provide the inspiration for a new song about Kulusevski, given that he hails from the same part of the world. He feels proud to have been welcomed so quickly into the hearts of Spurs supporters, saying of the chant delivered in his honour: ""I love it, of course.  ""All my friends send it to me all the time and think it’s really funny. ""I actually like the song and like that the fans are enjoying me playing."" Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! 🇸🇪 pic.twitter.com/6YGPquMBj5 The deal which took Kulusevski from Turin to north London does include an option to buy, which could become an obligation at €35 million (£29m/$37m) if certain conditions are met. The way things have been going, Spurs will consider that to be quite the bargain if a permanent transfer can be pushed through. That is because a Swedish star, quite literally, hit the ground running following his arrival in English football. What is your favourite Tottenham chant?

4686,What is Pep Guardiola's record vs Real Madrid? How Man City boss has fared against the Blancos,"Manchester City are preparing to lock horns with Real Madrid in the semi-finals of the 2021-22 Champions League, with that two-legged tie set to see Blues boss Pep Guardiola reunited with a familiar foe. The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich manager has locked horns with the Blancos on a regular basis in domestic and continental competition down the years. Unsurprisingly, given the calibre of player at his disposal, he has tended to fare admirably in meetings with the Liga heavyweights, but how does his overall record read? GOAL takes a look… Having inherited the managerial reins at Barcelona in the summer of 2008, it was never going to take long for Guardiola’s path to cross with their Clasico rivals. His first meeting with Real Madrid came on December 12, 2008 and proved to be a memorable event as the Blaugrana ran out 2-0 winners at Camp Nou. Guardiola’s second clash with the Blancos was even more entertaining, with a stunning 6-2 victory savoured at Santiago Bernabeu in May 2009. He took maximum points from his first five La Liga fixtures against the old adversaries from the Spanish capital and only suffered defeat against them on two occasions across 15 encounters as Barca boss. The last of those, in April 2012, started a run of three successive setbacks against the Blancos – with Bayern Munich enduring costly reversals home and away in the semi-finals of the 2013-14 Champions League. Guardiola had emerged victorious in a European last-four tie with Real once before, in 2010-11, and will be hoping to see City repeat those heroics in the present. Since arriving in English football back in 2016, the Catalan has taken on the 13-time continental kings just once – with his Premier League title hopefuls claiming a 4-2 aggregate success at the last-16 stage in 2020. Overall, Guardiola’s record makes for impressive reading, with 11 victories, four draws and four defeats taken from 19 meetings with Real.

Guardiola has, however, never been one to rest on his laurels or to read too much into events of the past. For him, focus must forever be locked on the present and future as continuous improvement is chased down. With that in mind, he has said of his previous duels with the Blancos: “I’ve lost and won against Real Madrid. You play hundreds of times against a rival and you win and lose, so none of that comes into it. “With the talent they have, the only way you can beat them is try to have more talent. “I have worked with some great teams that have faced them, but I don't feel any special sense for having beaten them. That belongs to the players. It's not something I can be especially pleased with.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/pep-guardiola-record-vs-real-madrid-man-city-blancos/blte29c5118e25c306e,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8954,VAR expert explains why it was impossible to overturn Ivan Toney’s '1000 IQ' goal,"In a crucial match against Nottingham Forest, Ivan Toney made a comeback from an eight-month ban and scored a vital free-kick, helping Brentford secure a 3-2 win over their relegation rivals.Toney levelled the score at 1-1 after Danilo scored early for Forest. Ben Mee later put the Bees in the lead, but Chris Wood equalized. In the end, Neal Maupay scored the decisive goal, securing a crucial win for Brentford.Despite the success, Toney's goal sparked some controversy. The 27-year-old moved the ball twice while Forest was setting up their wall and cleverly directed a shot through a gap between the wall and the post. He even adjusted some foam from the referee's spray.The Forest manager, Nuno Espirito Santo, questioned VAR's decision to let Toney's free-kick stand: ""It was ball displacement. The law is clear, every goal must be checked and every situation that leads to a goal must be checked.""But Dale Johnson, a VAR expert at ESPN, clarified that overturning the goal wasn't within VAR's authority. He mentioned on Twitter: ""Restarts aren't in VAR's remit.""The phrase ""restarts aren't in VAR's remit"" means that the VAR system is not responsible for making decisions related to restarting the game, such as awarding a corner kick, goal kick, or throw-in. The VAR's main role is to assist the on-field referee in making decisions on goals, penalty kicks, straight red card incidents, and mistaken identity in relation to these incidents.After the game, Toney defended his goal saying: ""You can move it half a yard either side. If I'd missed nobody would really question it, but the fact it's gone in everyone wants to make a noise. But it's gone in the back of the net and we've won the game.""'I didn’t watch football for a while': Ivan Toney reveals he lost passion for the game during his ban",https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-01-22-var-expert-explains-why-it-was-impossible-to-overturn-ivan-toneys-1000-iq-goal/,Andrii Sokolovskyi,2024-01-22T08:44:10.000Z,Dale Johnson
2303,'I'm not their dad' - Nagelsmann responds to criticism of Bayern Munich players' trip to Ibiza,"Julian Nagelsmann has refused to criticise his players after the squad went on holiday to Ibiza after last weekend’s defeat to Mainz. The squad, who had secured a 10th successive Bundesliga title the previous week, went on a two-day holiday to the Balearic Island just hours after losing 3-1 at Mewa Arena. The trip drew criticism from a number of prominent figures in Germany, including club legend and pundit Lothar Matthaus. Nagelsmann has been reluctant to comment on the Ibiza trip but did finally address the issue at a news conference previewing Sunday’s match at home to Stuttgart. ""Basically, Brazzo [sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic] said everything about it. I'm responsible for my team and I did justice to my responsibility by planning two days off from training,"" he said ""The players are of age, they're old enough, I'm not their dad or their teacher. If they decide to do so as a large group, that's up to them. The players can use these days as they want."" Nagelsmann also dismissed suggestions Bayern had damaged integrity of the competition by not taking matches seriously now they have secured the title. Mainz are safely in mid-table but Sunday’s opponents Stuttgart are currently in the relegation play-off spot,  just two points above second-bottom Arminia Bielefeld and three points behind Hertha Berlin. Hertha boss Felix Magath accused Bayern of disrespecting Bundesliga against Mainz by ""coasting"" through to the end of the season after securing the title. “It wasn't about distorting the competition against Mainz either, Mainz was already saved and we had nothing to lose."" He added. ""We have little to do with a team fighting relegation. ""We only have two games against VfB Stuttgart [a season], we have a duty to get to six points. But that's all we have to do with the relegation battle.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/nagelsmann-responds-bayern-players-ibiza/blt76976d54e7661da6,Tom Mallows,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
77,'This decision is final!' - Ozil says he will finish career at 'childhood love' Fenerbahce,"Mesut Ozil has revealed that he wants to finish his career at Fenerbahce. Ozil, 33, made the switch to the Turkish giants from Arsenal in January 2021, signing a contract that runs until 2024.  The Germany international was suspended by the club in March and he has revealed that he went six months without being paid. Despite the issue between him and the Super Lig side, Ozil has dismissed claims that he will soon leave as he insists he will see out his contract and end his career at the club. He wrote on Twitter: ""Recently, I have had to make a statement regarding the allegations made about my career. I had completed my career goal by signing a three-and-a-half-year contract with Fenerbahce, my childhood love, without even getting paid for the first six months. Son günlerde kariyerim ile ilgi yapılan iddialarla ilgili olarak bir açıklama yapmam zorunlu oldu.

I will work hard and always keep myself ready.  ""As I always say, the main thing is Fenerbahce. With my love and respect to the great Fenerbahce fans."" Until his suspension in March, Ozil was in fine form for the Turkish team. He struggled with injury at some points of the season, but managed to pitch in with eight Super Lig goals in 22 matches. He also struck once in the Europa League against Eintracht Frankfurt in his team's first game of the competition.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/this-decision-is-final-ozil-says-he-will-finish-career-at/blt3f521972c06e7606,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2280,Van Dijk takes record from Man Utd's Lee Sharpe as he goes incredible 60 games unbeaten at home with Liverpool,"Virgil van Dijk racked up his 60th Premier League home game without defeat for Liverpool to a set a new record in the English top flight. The Dutchman played all 90 minutes of his side's 1-0 defeat of West Ham United on Saturday. As well as his personal milestone, victory also keeps the Reds in the chase for the title behind leaders Manchester City. Since moving from Southampton in 2018, Van Dijk has never tasted defeat in the Premier League in front of the Anfield crowd. Going into Saturday's game the centre-back had played 59 home games for Liverpool in the competition, winning 51 and drawing eight. And he brought 60 up as Sadio Mane's solitary goal saw the Merseysiders through in a tense clash against the Hammers. Virgil van Dijk now has the best unbeaten home record with one club in Premier League history 🔴■ 52 wins■ 8 draws■ 0 defeats pic.twitter.com/fOHqUVxE1L No other player in Premier League history has managed to go through his first 60 Premier League home games unbeaten before for a club.  The previous record-holder was Lee Sharpe, who played four league seasons for Manchester United from the start of the competition in 1992 without losing at Old Trafford and reached a total of 59 matches.  Liverpool have now won their last seven outings in the league to close the gap on City to just three points.  While their deadly forward duo of Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane often gets the plaudits, Jurgen Klopp also has the luxury of a watertight defence marshalled by Van Dijk.  During that run the Reds have conceded just two goals, and with 20 goals against this season they have the third-best backline in the entire Premier League behind Pep Guardiola's charges and Chelsea.  They will be back in action at Anfield on Tuesday, when they defend a 2-0 Champions League last-16 advantage in the second leg against Inter.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/van-dijk-liverpool-record-lee-sharpe-man-utd/bltfe6a544a8dd83936,Daniel Edwards,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8037,"Neymarâs ânew childâ: a luxurious car worth more than $300,000","The Brazilian has shared some images of his new toy, a Rolls-Royce Ghost with an abundance of luxuries and comforts.  Neymar Jr. has become one of the headline-makers in recent months following the birth of his second daughter, his first with Bruna Biancardi, Mavie, with whom he broke up shortly afterward. Additionally, the Brazilian was linked to another model who claimed that he was going to be a father to a son, and even that he was the father of a 10-year-old boy. Yeah, less written about his sporting exploits since he swapped top flight European football for Saudi Arabia. These series of events have not been addressed by the Al Hilal player, although he did speak about some images that surfaced showing him looking completely different, more swollen, which the player later dismissed with another image demonstrating that he was in great shape. Despite not addressing the paternity rumours, the footballer has wanted to joke about this topic to share with his over 219 million Instagram followers some images of the new car he will now have in his garage. A vehicle he presented as his ânew child.â Judging by the features observed in the images posted by the Brazilian, it can be inferred from the shape of the hood that it is a Rolls Royce Ghost. A luxury sedan that is part of the second generation of the model, introduced in 2020, which has a more casual style than the rest of the models from the brand. Itâs a vehicle with all kinds of details in its interior, sophisticated, spacious, and with the particularity of opening its side doors like a book. A luxurious car that offers 571 horsepower and the ability to go from 0 to 100 km/h in just 4.8 seconds, reaching a maximum speed of 250 km/h, which is electronically limited. This Rolls-Royce Ghost seems to be the latest indulgence of the Brazilian footballer, which has a price is just over $300,000, although you could add up to another $50,000, depending on the version, engine and spec chosen by him.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Neymar%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cnew-child%E2%80%9D-a-luxurious-car-worth-more-than-%24300000/3302167,,1 day ago,all-football-app
1712,Salisu: Ghana World Cup legend Asamoah Gyan backs Southampton star's call-up,"Legendary Ghana striker Asamoah Gyan would welcome Southampton defender Mohammed Salisu into the Black Stars set-up ahead of the World Cup should the centre-back avail himself for national duty. The 22-year-old, who has refused to play for Ghana, has become a major subject of discussion, particularly following the Black Stars’ qualification for the global showpiece.  Although he has turned down invitations to the national team so far, there have been reports that the World Cup qualification is likely to soften his stand. However, a section of Ghana fans have questioned the player’s level of commitment to the country and if he deserves a place in the squad to Qatar. “Why not, he is not only the best defender in the Premiership, but the Premiership is also the best league in the world,” Gyan said on Peace FM when asked whether the Southampton man should be considered for the World Cup. “If he is rated among the top three defenders, definitely he is eligible to play for the national team if only he is in the plans of the coach and he [Salisu] has it in mind to play [for the country]. “Definitely, he should be ready for the national team, but it will depend on him and the technical team.” Ahead of their World Cup qualifying play-off clash with Nigeria last month, Ghana caretaker boss Otto Addo held another meeting with Salisu with the intention to convince the defender to change his mind. The centre-back, however, rejected the call one more time. “I watch him as a fan because he is doing well at Southampton,” Gyan added. “I think he is one of the top three defenders in the Premier League and he being a Ghanaian, I think he is selling the country.  “He is performing well but I don’t know if he wants to play for the national team.” Salisu has been hailed as one of the best defenders in the Premier League this season, as he currently stands as the player with the most interceptions so far. He has made 29 league appearances for the Saints this term, starting in all but one of the matches.

2753,Afcon stampede: Eight confirmed dead in Yaounde stadium crush ahead of Cameroon vs Comoros last-16 tie,"The Confederation of African Football has launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding a deadly stampede at the Stade d’Olembe in Yaounde on Monday evening ahead of Africa Cup of Nations hosts Cameroon’s Round of 16 clash with Comoros. Initial reports of six deaths, which circulated in the immediate aftermath of the fixture, have now been updated to eight fatalities in a government statement, while the names of some of the victims have begun to emerge. “The first summary of the stampede is that there are eight deaths and 38 injured, of whom 31 have light injuries and seven serious,” read a statement from the Ministry of Communication, as seen by GOAL. “The deceased were taken to the Emergency Centre in Yaounde for appropriate formalities, while the injured were sent to four different health centres in the city of Yaounde. “They were immediately alerted following instructions from the President of the Republic Paul Biya.” Local authorities clarified to GOAL in the immediate aftermath of the incident how supporters attempted to enter the arena when policemen attempted to move a barrier at the South Entrance of the stadium. Fans closer to the gate were trampled beneath those who attempted to enter the arena, with supporters still being transported to hospital from the stadium medical centre at 23:30 local time — three and a half hours after kick-off — while other victims had been treated in the players' treatment room. Some of the things I witnessed at the Stade d’Olembe in Yaounde this evening.One young teenager, hooked to an ECG machine, stretched to a medical facility over three hours after the match.Red Cross medics worked until almost midnight trying to stabilise victims, save lives. pic.twitter.com/pEk8Xz6CbI “In light of this drama, the gravity of which creates emotion and consternation, the Chief of State addresses his saddest condolences to the families who have been hardly affected, while also wishing a quick recovery to the injured, to whom he passes the profound compassion of the whole nation.” President Biya has also confirmed the launching of an enquiry into the incident, while the Confederation of African Football announced on Monday that they were beginning their own investigation into the circumstances surrounding the tragedy. The government has also called on match-going spectators to demonstrate “a sense of responsibility, discipline, and civility of all for the success of this major sporting party”. “Caf is aware of the incident that took place at Olembe Stadium during the TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations fixture between hosts Cameroon and Comoros tonight, 24 January 2022,” read a statement from African football’s governing body, as seen by GOAL. “Caf is currently investigating the situation and trying to get more details on what transpired. We are in constant communication with Cameroon government and the Local Organizing Committee."" Caf President Dr Patrice Motsepe sent the General Secretary Veron Mosengo-Omba to visit the supporters in hospital in Yaounde in the hours following the crush. Officials at Yaounde’s Messassi hospital told AP that at least 40 injured people had been transferred to their facility, while the local gendarmerie confirmed to GOAL that deaths and injuries had occurred when supporters attempting to enter the stadium had crushed those who had fallen in front of them. GOAL on the scene witnessed Red Cross medics attending to patients attached to electrocardiogram machines, wrapped in silver foil having found themselves involved in the crush. One young teenage supporter was wheeled from the players’ medical room to a waiting ambulance on a stretcher, before being taken to a nearby medical facility. Medical staff at the stadium appeared in various states of distress in the aftermath of the incident, but were only able to share that they were hopeful that those victims who were transported to hospital in time would receive the treatment they required to pull away from danger. Fifa have also send their condolences to those affected by the tragedy, offering the “thoughts and prayers of the global football community” to the victims, injured, and staff involved in the incidents ahead of Monday’s game. Cameroon midfielder Samuel Oum Gouet is one of several players involved in the tournament to acknowledgement the disaster on his social media handles. ""Big thoughts for all of the families hit hard in light of the stampede ahead of our Last 16 match,"" the KV Mechelen man began on his Facebook page. ""Quick recovery to the injured, thank you for your support."" While the names of some victims had begun to circulate in unverified reports in the aftermath of the tragedy, GOAL have received confirmation from one of the local schools in Yaounde of the death of one of their students—Louis Bruno Zinga Ndongo—who attended Catholic Jean Tabi College in the capital. “There was the kind of stampede we witness everywhere where there are these kinds of large crowd movements,” Afcon Organising Committee spokesman Abel Mbengue said, as per L’Equipe. “We are waiting for reliable information on the victims.” The 60,000-capacity stadium had a reduced capacity of 50,000 for the match, with the arena operating at 80 per cent capacity due to restrictions installed ahead of the competition in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus. Cameroon ultimately beat Comoros 2-1 in the encounter to progress to the quarter-finals where they will meet Gambia in Douala on January 29.

10450,Most Consecutive Wins for One Premier League Team Against Another,"Which teams have had a stronghold over another for the most games? We look at the most consecutive Premier League wins against one opponent. Manchester City were unable to equal the record for most wins by one Premier League team against another when they lost to Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium in October 2023. They do still jointly hold the record though along with Manchester United, and they could surpass it against another opponent before the 2023-24 season has finished. Here are the longest consecutive winning streaks for one team against another in Premier League history. * – Currently ongoing Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United had a hold over Wigan from the moment the latter had defied all odds to reach the Premier League, winning their first 13 Premier League meetings between 2005 and 2011. That run was finally ended in significant fashion, with Shaun Maloney’s goal in a 1-0 win for Wigan in April 2012 at DW Stadium not only enough to end the streak, but also to start the collapse of United’s title challenge in 2011-12. Ferguson’s side eventually relinquished their lead at the top to Manchester City for their first ever Premier League title following that Sergio Agüero goal on the final day. A run that began with a 4-0 win for Man City at the Etihad Stadium in April 2012, they scored 37 goals across these 13 wins and conceded nine. It finally came to an end in December 2020, also at the Etihad. İlkay Gündoğan had given City the lead, only for a Rúben Dias own goal to level things just before half-time as West Brom secured a 1-1 draw. They also got relegated at the end of the campaign, but at least this was somewhat of a silver lining. A still ongoing streak has seen City dominate Bournemouth, having beaten them in all 13 of their Premier League meetings to date. Prior to Bournemouth arriving in the top flight in 2015, their previous clash had been a 0-0 draw in League One in February 1999. City beat them 5-1 at the Etihad in their first Premier League meeting in October 2015, with Raheem Sterling scoring a hat-trick. Wilfried Bony also scored twice, while Glenn Murray found the net for the visitors. Their most recent clash was in November 2023, with City running out 6-1 winners at the Etihad. Man City had won 12 Premier League meetings against Arsenal heading into their clash at the Emirates in October 2023, and could have equalled the record. Arsenal had scored just five goals against City in that time and conceded 33. It is their longest ever losing run against an opponent in their league history. The run started with a 3-1 win for City at the Etihad in November 2017, with goals from Kevin De Bruyne, Agüero (penalty) and Gabriel Jesus, who would join Arsenal less than five years later. However, a determined performance from Mikel Arteta’s men in October 2023 saw them secure a 1-0 win over City to end the streak. Gabriel Martinelli came on as a late sub to win it with an 86th-minute strike that deflected in off the unfortunate Nathan Aké. City’s record against Arsenal may have stopped at 12, but there are three more teams against whom their run is still going. Their recent 5-1 thrashing of Fulham was their 12th league success in a row against them. That run started all the way back in February 2012 when goals from Agüero (penalty), a Chris Baird own goal and Edin Džeko secured a 3-0 win. City haven’t played against Watford since April 2022, but their run of 12 Premier League wins against the Hornets is still ongoing. They have racked up the goals in that run as well, which began in August 2015 with a 2-0 home win. Across the 12 victories, City have won by an aggregate score of 45-6, including an 8-0 win at the Etihad in September 2019. Our final City entry is one that did eventually come to an end. They had enjoyed 12 consecutive victories in the Premier League against Newcastle between 2009 and 2015. It began with a 2-1 home win in January 2009 thanks to goals from Shaun Wright-Phillips and Craig Bellamy, and their final win of the sequence was a 6-1 success in October 2015 in which Agüero scored five goals. A 1-1 draw at St. James’ Park in April 2016 finally ended the run. It doesn’t feel like Chelsea have beaten many teams lately, but they do seem to have Crystal Palace’s number. The last time Palace took any points off Chelsea was back in October 2017, when a César Azpilicueta own goal and Wilfried Zaha secured a 2-1 win at Selhurst Park. It was such a bygone era that Chelsea’s goal that day came from Tiémoué Bakayoko. Since then, Chelsea have won 11 on the bounce against Palace in the Premier League, with their last meeting seeing them win 1-0 at Stamford Bridge in January thanks to a Kai Havertz goal. This one only came to an end last season. Liverpool started a run of 11 Premier League wins over Wolves back in January 2011 when a Fernando Torres brace either side of a superb Raul Meireles strike at Molineux secured a 3-0 win for the visitors. It was also at Molineux where the run ended in February this year, also by a score of 3-0 as Wolves eased past an out-of-sorts Liverpool. A Joel Matip own goal inside five minutes was quickly followed by Craig Dawson adding a second, before Rúben Neves rounded things off in the second half. This is actually the longest win streak for one team against another in English top-flight history as it was made up of 15 wins for Chelsea, though only 11 of those came in the Premier League era. After losing 1-0 at the Hawthorns in March 1979, Chelsea won their next four meetings in the old First Division in the mid-80s, before also winning their first ever Premier League clash in October 2002, 2-0 at Stamford Bridge, followed by 10 more. The run was finally ended in March 2012 when a solitary Gareth McAuley goal was enough to give West Brom a 1-0 home win. A 4-0 win over Sunderland in March 2002 was the start of another 11-game Premier League run for Chelsea against a single opponent. Goals at Stamford Bridge that day came from William Gallas, Eidur Gudjohnsen, Mikael Forssell and Sam Dalla Bona. The final win of the streak made it look like it might never end, a 7-2 thrashing at Stamford Bridge in January 2010. However, that November, they met again at Chelsea’s ground and Sunderland ran out 3-0 victors thanks to goals from Nedum Onuoha, Asamoah Gyan and Danny Welbeck. A goal from David Beckham gave Man Utd a 1-0 win at Villa Park in March 2003 to begin what would become an 11-game winning streak over the Midlands club in the Premier League. Villa only scored three goals across those 11 games, so it was somewhat appropriate that the run was ended in November 2008 with a 0-0 draw at Villa Park. Despite their troubles against Man City between 2017 and 2023, rewind to between 1994 and 2004 and Arsenal were the ones who could not stop beating City. Of course, this was mostly Arsene Wenger’s impressive Gunners against pre-Sheikh Mansour investment City, but it’s still interesting. It was actually George Graham’s Arsenal who started the run with a 3-0 home win on the opening day of the 1994-95 season, with goals coming from Kevin Campbell and Ian Wright either side of a Steve McMahon own goal. It finally ended with a 1-1 draw at Highbury in January 2005, with Freddie Ljungberg cancelling out Shaun Wright-Phillips’ opener.

389,"'I was angry, but it was my fault' - Flachi on cocaine ban after making football comeback 12 years after last game","Ex-Fiorentina and Sampdoria star Francesco Flachi admitted he was forced to change his life after spending more than a decade out of the game due to a drugs ban. Flachi received a 12-year suspension in 2010 after testing positive for cocaine while at Brescia. At the age of 46, and with his ban finally over, he made a shock comeback in the fifth tier in February for local side Signa 1914. ""It was a really long time, even if now it seems to have passed quickly. It was a long time and not at all easy mentally,"" Flachi told Fanpage. ""Because it changes your life and it is not easy: I had to reinvent myself, since due to the ban I could not be registered with anybody, at most I could have some collaboration.  ""At the beginning, in reality, I had only a little to do with football, not the fault of the others but my fault. The striker, who played alongside Gabriel Batistuta at Fiorentina and later scored almost 100 goals for Sampdoria at his peak, added that his return to the game was almost a chance event. ""It could be said that it came from a coincidence,"" he explained. ""There was a seven-a-side football tournament here in Signa, I was part of the team and therefore the president came to see me play. ""He teased and motivated me by telling me that I was no longer that good, even though I was playing well, and after he told me once, twice, three, four times I told him to give me a try.  ""In that moment it was a thing just to say, like a far-fetched one. Then but the more time passed, we felt, talked and slowly it became more and more interesting.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/flachi-cocaine-ban-comeback-12-years/blt0504a6155c26ae3a,Daniel Edwards,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8111,PLAYER RATINGS: Scott McTominay rescues crucial win,"Manchester United breathed new life into their late Champions League push after beating Aston Villa 2-1 to move just six points off fourth place.  Scott McTominay was brought off the bench and scored the winning goal four minutes from time after meeting Diogo Dalot's superb cross and nodding home. A defeat for United would have moved them 11 points adrift of the top four but Rasmus Hojlund settled any nerves after tucking home the opener just yards out. Douglas Luiz's quick thinking found the equaliser for Villa, however, after the visitors failed to clear their lines from a goalmouth scramble on 67 minutes. But substitute McTominay later rescued United's listing campaign and here, Mail Sport's IAN LADYMAN has rated both sets of players from Villa Park...  MANCHESTER UNITED ANDRE ONANA 8.5 Two fabulous first half saves kept United in front during a spell of intense Villa pressure. Continued in same vein after the break. Starting to look like a United goalkeeper at last.  DIOGO DALOT 6 Struggled with the Villa raids down his side. Too often exposed for pace on the turn. Never found wanting for effort and great cross for the winner. HARRY MAGUIRE 8 Continuing to enjoy his renaissance at United. Did the simple things well and although he is no longer captain he has emerged as a leader. Superb.  RAFAEL VARANE 6 Needed his goalkeeper to help him cover a couple of times in the first half as Villa played quick balls beyond him. Still reads the game terrifically well. LUKE SHAW 6 Only managed 45 minutes and United will hope he is not badly hurt. Erik Ten Hag needs a settled back four and he needs Shaw to be part of it. CASEMIRO â 5.5 Needs young Kobbie Mainoo's legs beside him to do his running. Will improve with more games but here he was not at his best. Too many misplaced passes. KOBBIE MAINOO 6.5 The find of the season for United and will learn from afternoons like this, when the opposition control large parts of the game. Worked manfully, won plenty of duels but needed help.  ALEJANDRO GARNACHO 6.5 Much improved in terms of decision making and final pass. A threat down the United right on the counter. Needs to find that end product more often. BRUNO FERNANDES 6 Struggled to impact the game as his team found it hard to enjoy extended possession. Needed a better platform behind him. MARCUS RASHFORD 5.5 Seems engaged once more and threatened with a couple of runs down the left. Fluffed one chance he made for himself. Fitful, though. RASMUS HOJLUND 7 Goals are flowing now and though he would benefit from better service, he worried Villa here on the counter. Improving.  SUBSTITUTIONS VICTOR LINDELOF (on for Shaw 45) 5 Gave ball away with just about first touch and Onana bailed him out. Looked miles off at times. SCOTT MCTOMINAY (on for Rashford 73mins) 8 Sent on to save the game and won the game. What a header. JONNY EVANS (on for Hojlund 90mins) SOFYAN AMRABAT (on for Mainoo 90mins) ASTON VILLA EMILIANO MARTINEZ 6 Had no chance with either United opening goal. Strangely, didn't have that much to do. MATTY CASH 5.5 An afternoon to concentrate up against Marcus Rashford but was rarely beaten or exposed. Bullied by McTominay for the winner.  DIEGO CARLOS 6 Dealt with the pace of the United attack well. Rarely beaten in the air. CLEMENT LENGLET 6 Played a part in Villa's equaliser and looked composed as Villa built play from the back. ALEX MORENO 6 An important cog in Villa's attacking machine down the left but struggled at times to contain Alejandro Garnacho in his own half. BOUBACAR KAMARA 6.5 Powerful and intelligent in midfield. Much of the prompting behind Villa's thrusts in the attacking third came from him. DOUGLAS LUIZ 7 Such an important player for Villa. Does the simple things well and keeps the ball moving. Influential. Big chance at 1-1 but couldn't make firm enough contact.  LEON BAILEY 7.5 Dangerous and direct whenever he gets the ball in wide positions. Curled a good chance wide when could have done better during a spell of early Villa dominance.  JACOB RAMSEY 7 Back from injury and looking sharp. Having him in the team will be important in the run-in. Unlucky that Maguire blocked one goal bound shot. JOHN MCGINN 7.5 First half shot almost broke Onana's fingers and his passing and prompting oozed intelligence as always. His energy levels rarely dipped. Best passer on the field. OLLIE WATKINS 6.5 Played Hojlund onside for United opener and should do better than that. Troubled United's central defensive pairing with his clever darts in and behind them. Will play worse and score.  SUBSTITUTIONS MOUSSA DIABY (on for Kamara 64mins) 6 Brought freshness but couldn't make decisive contributions. YOURI TIELEMANS (on for Bailey 73mins) 6 Should be asking himself why he hasn't managed to get a place in this team. LUCAS DIGNE (on for Moreno 87mins) 6 NICOLO ZANIOLO (on for McGinn 87mins) 6",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/PLAYER-RATINGS-Scott-McTominay-rescues-crucial-win/3300332,,12-Feb,all-football-app
2029,Nigeria’s Ighalo hits brace as Al Hilal defeat Istiklol to storm AFC Champions League Round of 16,"Nigeria international Odion Ighalo scored a brace to help Al Hilal defeat Istiklol 3-0 to become the first team to qualify for the Round of 16 of the AFC Champions League on Tuesday night. The Saudi Arabian giants were the better side in the Group A fixture at Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium and they took a deserved lead in the eighth minute courtesy of the 32-year-old Super Eagle. Ighalo then doubled the lead in the 33rd minute before Salem Al Dawsari powered home the third deep into stoppage time.  It took Al Hilal only eight minutes to take the lead and it was Ighalo who found the back of the net after jumping the highest to head a cross from Salman Al Faraj past goalkeeper Rustam Yatimov. Two minutes after the goal, Tajikistan’s Istiklol were forced into an early change when their keeper Yatimov suffered an injury and was replaced by Mukhriddin Khasanov. A Beautiful Win Tonight, Now Qualified To The Round Of 16 ✅ pic.twitter.com/jyRmxx9FGo Ighalo notched the second after he latched onto a cross from Mohammed Al Burayk while inside the box, made a quick turn, left his marker stranded, and slot the ball home with a right-footed effort past Khasanov. The second period also saw Al Hilal dominate proceedings and Ighalo could have grabbed a hat-trick in the 56th minute when he jumped once again to meet another cross from Al Faraj with a powerful header but this time Khasanov reacted quickly to put the ball out. Istiklol had a good chance to reduce the deficit in the 67th minute when Eric Bocoum set up Muhammad Isaev but the second-half substitute could not find the target from the edge of the box as his effort went inches wide. Al Dawsari then sealed the emphatic win for Al Hilal after he scored from close range deep into added time to help his side claim a fourth straight victory and a slot in the Round of 16. Ighalo, who joined Al Hilal from Al Shabab, has now scored two goals in the competition.  The result ensured Al Hilal remain unbeaten in the group from four matches, and are top with 12 points, five more than Al Rayyan, while UAE’s Sharjah - who lost 3-1 to the Qatari side also on Tuesday - are third with four points. Ighalo and Al Hilal will return to action with their matchday five fixture against Sharjah at Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium on April 23.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/nigeria-ighalo-hits-brace-as-al-hilal-defeat-istiklol-to/blt2f3567004e802910,Dennis Mabuka,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7449,'Peace' - Man Utd & Watford players unite to send strong message amid Ukraine-Russia tensions,"Manchester United and Watford players displayed a message calling for peace amid the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Russia's aggression in Ukraine has seen the football world react, with many players voicing their hopes for an end to the conflict. The game at Old Trafford was another example, as the players came together to display a message of peace and unity.

The display comes a day after United decided to end their sponsorship with Aeroflot as a result of the crisis in Eastern Europe.

1027,Real Madrid forward Benzema overtakes Thierry Henry as highest-scoring French player in modern era with 413 goals,"Karim Benzema's double for Real Madrid on Monday saw him overtake Thierry Henry as the highest-scoring French player in the modern era. Less than a week after he eased past Madrid icon Alfredo Di Stefano to become the third-top scorer in the club's history, Benzema has surpassed one of his country's all-time greats. The striker reached the milestone when he fired in twice against Mallorca to help Madrid strengthen their hold on first place in La Liga. Benzema now has 413 goals to his name for club and country. That sees him overtake Les Bleus and Arsenal hero Henry, who finished his career on 411. Overall, Benzema has scored 311 goals for the Santiago Bernabeu team, 66 for Lyon and 36 in his 94 caps for France. It is not known if that makes the 34-year-old the all-time scorer in French history as some historical data is not available, but he has confirmed his place as his nation's finest in the modern game. Benzema's stunning hat-trick against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League last week saw him move above Di Stefano in his club's list of top scorers. He is now the third highest-scoring player in Madrid's history with 311 goals, while Di Stefano finished his career on 308. Spain great Raul is still above Benzema with 323 goals, while Cristiano Ronaldo is top of the list on 451.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/real-madrid-benzema-overtakes-thierry-henry-highest-scoring/bltc422b53ac013b7a1,By Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

10141,Mauritania vs Algeria Prediction and Preview,"We look ahead to Tuesday’s Group D clash at the Africa Cup of Nations 2023 with our Mauritania vs Algeria prediction and preview. Having made a hugely disappointing start to AFCON 2023, Algeria’s hopes of progressing to the knockout stage rest on them securing a positive result in their final game. Fortunately for the North Africans, on MD 3 they face what should be their easiest match so far at the tournament. Two draws from two – against Angola (1-1) and Burkina Faso (2-2) – leave Algeria, who were fourth favourites to win the whole competition in our pre-tournament predictions, third in Group D and probably in need of a victory in their third and final match. Up against a Mauritania side who have never won a game at the Africa Cup of Nations (two draws and six losses in eight games), they have the perfect chance to get their campaign back on track. After stumbling against Angola in their opening match, Algeria needed a 95th-minute Baghdad Bounedjah equaliser to rescue a point against Burkina Faso. Bounedjah has scored all three of Algeria’s goal at AFCON 2023 (3), meaning he is now two goals away from setting a new record for the most goals scored by an Algerian at any edition of the Africa Cup of Nations. Algeria have won four of their five meetings with Mauritania, so this should be a decent opportunity to put their own poor recent AFCON record to an end; they are without a win in five successive Africa Cup of Nations games for the first time since 2013. However, Mauritania can’t be completely written off, simply because they managed a draw with Algeria in their most recent meeting – an international friendly in December 2022. They also showed noteworthy improvement in their last match – a 3-2 defeat to Angola. In that game, Mauritania scored more goals than in any of their other previous AFCON matches and also took their total of shots on target at the tournament to eight – more than they managed in the whole of AFCON 2021 (six). They will take confidence from that game into this one. Algeria are historically the bigger and more successful footballing nation, so it is no real surprise that they have the better of the teams’ head-to-head record. With four wins and a draw from five meetings, Algeria have dominated matches between these sides. This will, however, be their first meeting at the Africa Cup of Nations. Also, having earned a goalless draw in their most recent meeting with Algeria, Mauritania will hope they can get another positive result here.  Given the two sides’ relative strengths, it comes as no surprise that the Opta supercomputer makes Algeria strong favourites for this game. It predicts they take all three points in 70.7% of simulations. Mauritania have a slim 9.4% chance of causing a massive upset, while the draw comes in at 19.9%.  Our pre-tournament predictions had Algeria as fourth favourites, giving them a 9.7% chance of winning AFCON glory. That chance has now dropped, albeit not by a lot, with the Fennec Foxes handed a 7.3% shot at winning the title as of writing.  Given the strength of Mauritania, Algeria still have a very solid chance of qualifying for the last 16, doing so in 78.7% of tournament simulations at the time of writing.  Below are each team’s current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Mauritania: Namori Diaw, M’Backé N’Diaye, Babacar Niasse, Aly Abeid, Mohamed Dellahi, Lamine Ba, Khadim Diaw, Ibrahima Keita, Hassan Houbeib, Bakary N’Diaye, Nouh El Abd, Mouhsine Bodda, Sidi El Abd, Oumar Ngom, Omaré Gassama, Abdallahi Mahmoud, El Ba, Bakari Camara, Guessouma Fofana, Pape Bâ, Aboubakary Koïta, Sidi Amar, Souleymane Doukara, Hemeya Tanjy, Aboubakar Kamara, Souleymane Anne, Idrissa Thiam.

5083,Martinez makes Man Utd move in £46.5m transfer as Red Devils beat Arsenal to Ajax defender,"Manchester United have completed the signing of Lisandro Martinez from Ajax, with the Argentina international defender making his way to Old Trafford at the end of a protracted transfer saga. Erik ten Hag quickly identified the 24-year-old as a top target after making his own move from the Eredivisie champions to the Premier League heavyweights this summer. He has now got his man, with the Red Devils further reinforcing their back line with a player that will be eager to impress in new surroundings – particularly with the 2022 World Cup fast approaching. The Red Devils are investing £46.5 million ($53m) worth of faith in Martinez, with another big-money centre-half being added to their defensive ranks. Ajax confirmed that the total value of the transfer could rise to £57m ($68m) once add-ons and other variables are taken into account. Martinez will reportedly commit to a five-year contract in Manchester, with those terms set to take him through to the summer of 2027. United have released an official statement confirming that an agreement is now in place with Ajax, which reads: ""Manchester United is delighted to announce the club has reached agreement with Ajax for the transfer of Argentine international defender Lisandro Martinez, subject to medical, to player terms being finalised, and to UK visa requirements."" An agreement has been reached for the transfer of Lisandro Martinez 🔴🇦🇷#MUFC || @LisandrMartinez United were not the only Premier League side to make a move for Martinez during the current transfer window, with old adversaries Arsenal also looking to do a deal at one stage. The Gunners had a formal offer on the table, but GOAL was able to confirm that interest from Emirates Stadium cooled after being unable to agree a fee. That left a path clear for the Red Devils to push an agreement through, with former goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar – who is now chief executive at Ajax – reportedly helping to broker a deal. The funds required to get a transfer for Martinez over the line suggest that he will be lined up for a starting berth by Ten Hag. United do, however, have a number of other international centre-halves at their disposal and big decisions will need to be made when it comes to rotation and possible departures. Lisandro turning heads. 👀👨‍✈️✅ Tadic approves.#UCL #ajalil pic.twitter.com/HlGhiqqOms It has been confirmed that Harry Maguire will be retaining captaincy duties for 2022-23, meaning that he should start plenty of domestic and European fixtures, while Raphael Varane is a World Cup winner with France. Victor Lindelof has made close to 200 appearances for United, and remains a reliable option, while Ivorian star Eric Bailly is a popular figure among supporters despite finding regular game time hard to come by of late. By James Robson, Man Utd Correspondent for GOAL Ten Hag inherited no shortage of centre-backs at United, but it is a case of whether they are the right profile to play his possession-based game and build out from the back. Martinez is seen as precisely that – and United’s new manager has no concerns about his short stature, having seen him dominate in the Netherlands with Ajax. The Argentina international is also good in possession and will be comfortable taking the ball in tight spaces when under pressure. As a left-sided centre-back, he will either provide cover for Harry Maguire, or allow the United captain to move over the right, where he is more comfortable. Much of the focus over recent weeks has centred around Cristiano Ronaldo and his desire to leave for a trophy-chasing rival. United are working hard to get more bodies on board, though, with Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong having figured towards the top of their summer shopping list for some time. A deal to sign the Netherlands international from Barcelona is now close, and like Martinez, he is another player that Ten Hag knows well from his time at Ajax, with there a number of other stars with ties to the Eredivisie giants that the Dutch tactician has his eye on. There has been talk of Brazilian forward Antony swapping Amsterdam for Manchester, but Jurrien Timber appears destined to remain in the Netherlands. While struggling to tempt a right-back to Old Trafford, Ten Hag has secured the signing of Tyrell Malacia, with the highly-rated 22-year left-back having completed his switch from Feyenoord. Christian Eriksen has also completed his move on a free transfer from Brentford, while a back-up goalkeeper could be drafted in following the loan departure of Dean Henderson to Nottingham Forest.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/martinez-man-utd-transfer-ajax-defender/bltaa66de6b5caad111,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1284,FIFA ranking: Mexico vs Suriname - CONCACAF Nations League teams compared,"Mexico is all set to kick-start their CONCACAF Nations League with a clash against Suriname on Saturday June 11.

10488,UEFA Champions League Stats Recap: Matchday 3,"We look back at the key UEFA Champions League stats, stories and moments that matter from Matchday 3 of the 2023-24 competition. It was all looking so promising for Newcastle; their first season back at Europe’s top table began with four points from two games against bona fide European heavyweights in AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain, the latter of whom they battered 4-1. They went into the Matchday 3 visit of Borussia Dortmund with a 53.4% likelihood of topping Group F, making them the favourites. Furthermore, their opponents on Wednesday hadn’t scored a Champions League goal in three matches. But now their prospects don’t look quite so rosy. Losing Alexander Isak to injury early on was hardly helpful, and that came amid a ferocious start from Dortmund, who put Nick Pope to work right away with what was certainly the better of the play in the opening 30 minutes: Dortmund eventually went ahead just before half-time as Felix Nmecha met Nico Schlotterbeck’s cut-back with a first-time finish into the right side of the net; that ended the club’s run of 377 minutes without a goal in the competition and ensured they weren’t going to be held to nil four matches in a row for the first time ever. The first half served as a stark reminder for Newcastle, just in case they were starting to believe the hype after beating PSG. At the break, they’d conceded 29 shots in the opening 45 minutes of games in the competition this term, with only Crvena Zvezda facing more. Proceedings were much tighter after the interval, though Newcastle still mustered a late onslaught. Callum Wilson, Isak’s first-half replacement, hit the crossbar with a header in the 86th minute, just before the clock ticked a whole 30 minutes since Dortmund’s last shot. Anthony Gordon then struck against the bar as well deep into second-half stoppage time as Dortmund just about held on to blow Group F wide open, with Newcastle dropping from first to third and their visitors going second behind PSG. It doesn’t get much easier from here for Newcastle, either. They now have back-to-back trips to Dortmund and Paris to contend with, leaving them with a significantly reduced probability of winning the group (26.9%).  Milan can’t score. Nevermind any successes in Serie A – they’re currently second but coming off a defeat to Juventus. After Wednesday’s 3-0 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain, Stefano Pioli’s side have now gone five straight Champions League matches dating to last season’s semi-final tie against Inter without scoring a goal. That was acceptable through two group-stage matches because Milan didn’t concede either and a point against both Borussia Dortmund and Newcastle was hardly cause for sedition, but Wednesday’s loss has Milan midway through the group stage on two points at the bottom of Group F with a 23.4% chance of getting through. This season’s UCL campaign started off promisingly enough, even if the finishing wasn’t there. Milan managed 25 shots (nine on target) with 1.99 xG on Matchday 1 at home against Newcastle. Rafael Leão was working the ball into the box. They looked legitimately dangerous and came out of that match feeling unlucky. But that dwindled to two shots on target against Dortmund on MD2 and 0.63 xG versus PSG. After Dortmund’s 1-0 win against Newcastle, it leaves Milan and Benfica as the only two teams in the competition without a goal at the midway point of the opening round. Perhaps two upcoming home matches against PSG and Dortmund – plus a little desperation – will get Milan started before it’s too late. No one expected Manchester City to struggle in Group G. And no one, through three matchdays, has been wrong. Sure, they’ve taken their time winning their Champions League matches, but Pep Guardiola’s side have won all three after Wednesday’s 3-1 victory over Young Boys. While their goal difference of six is one back of Barcelona’s competition-leading mark, the underlying numbers are about as spectacular as you’d expect in a group with RB Leipzig, Young Boys and Crvena Zvezda. They’re our favourites to win a second straight Champions League title, now with a 30.2% chance to lift the trophy in back-to-back seasons. Considering we’re still at the stage in the competition that houses 32 teams, that’s a pretty big number. It’s a pretty big number because Man City themselves put up pretty big numbers. Such as, but not limited to… While it may not have been a game to capture the imagination of many neutrals, Antwerp 1-4 FC Porto was momentous even before it kicked off. It was a day to remember particularly for Porto centre-back Pepe, who at 40 years and 241 days old became the eldest outfield player to feature in a Champions League game. The record had previously been 40 years and 211 days, which was curiously set by two players in 2010: Alessandro Costacurta and David Weir. The Brazil-born Portugal international has been a colossus of European football through his career, particularly during a glittering 10-year spell with Real Madrid from 2007 to 2017, winning the competition three times at the Santiago Bernabéu. Following two years at Besiktas, Pepe returned for a second spell at Porto in 2019 and is still going strong into his fifth decade. However, Pepe’s still got a little way to go to become the Champions League’s outright oldest player; four goalkeepers (Mark Schwarzer, Olexandr Shovkovskiy, Gianluigi Buffon and Marco Ballotta) have all played in the competition aged 41 or older. Ballotta holds the all-time record. The Italian was 43 years and 252 days old when he played against Real Madrid for Lazio in December 2007. It’s a record that’ll take some beating, especially for outfield players. But in the home of Port, Pepe is aging like a fine wine nonetheless. Teammate Evanilson also has reason to raise a glass; he became just the seventh player in Champions League history – and the first Brazilian – to score a hat-trick off the bench, his heroics proving decisive in Belgium. On digital paper, Feyenoord-Lazio was the joint-closest matchup up of Champions League Matchday 3 in what’s shaping up to be a rather compelling group in this season’s competition. Lazio entered the match ranked 26th in the Opta Power Rankings with Feyenoord two places behind as the second best Dutch side (Milan and Paris Saint-Germain were also separated by two positions heading into today’s games). On the pitch, the gap was far greater from the opening whistle as the Eredivisie champions took ahold of Group E with a 3-1 win at De Kuip. The first goal came from the scoring source they’ve come to rely on domestically but haven’t yet been able to play in the Champions League. Santiago Giménez’s 31st-minute goal came not long after he had another disallowed for offside, and they didn’t slow down. Ramiz Zerrouki made it 2-0 in first-half stoppage time with a first-time strike from the top of the box on a ball played back from the penalty area by Calvin Stengs – one of a match-leading seven chances created by the winger. Each of those chances came from open play for the highest single-match total by a player in the competition this season. Giménez’s second came in the 74th minute, and the 22-year-old has now scored 15 goals on a nine-match scoring streak in all competitions. He’s the first Feyenoord player with a streak of that length in a decade. Lazio have now gone 22 Champions League games without a clean sheet, which amounts to the longest active run of any side currently in the competition. They entered this match with a 61.1% chance of progressing with Feyenoord trailing behind at 48.7%. They’ve swapped with Feyenoord as the second most likely team to progress (68.6% to Lazio’s 42.5, both behind Atlético Madrid) from the group, and for at least the next two hours, Arne Slot’s side are atop Group E with six points. A great week for Fermín López got even better as the young midfielder scored what proved to be the winning goal on his first Champions League start for Barcelona. The talented 20-year-old was signed in pre-season from Linares but has enjoyed a rapid ascension, breaking into the first-team squad and already signing a new contract to keep him tied to the club until 2027. Just one day after that news was announced, Xavi handed Fermín his first Champions League start; he certainly repaid the faith. He’d already hit the crossbar before eventually converting, picking out the bottom-left corner after cleverly turning away from a defender, adding to Ferran Torres’ opener. That made Fermín the fifth-youngest Barcelona player to score to score on his first Champions League start at 20 years and 167 days old – he thought he had a second goal later but saw the towering header disallowed for a marginal offside call. It was also a good day for Ferran, who’s opener came via a cool finish on the rebound after Fermín struck the bar. He was then the one to find the youngster for the second, making this the first time since April that he’s recorded a goal and an assist in the same game. Despite Barcelona’s dominance, the second goal proved vital. Heorhii Sudakov (21y, 54d) became Shakhtar’s youngest Ukrainian scorer in the Champions League since November 2000 after the hour, forcing a slightly tense finale, but they got the job done to move on to nine points from three games. The knockouts are within touching distance. Harry Maguire and André Onana were the heroes as Manchester United secured a much-needed first win of the season in the Champions League. Erik ten Hag’s men were desperate for a win after losing their opening two Group A games against Bayern Munich and Galatasaray, and for large parts of Tuesday’s clash against Copenhagen they didn’t look like they were going to have an easy night of it. Jacob Neestrup’s visitors enjoyed much of the play at Old Trafford and started strongest, recording five shots in the opening six minutes – including Diogo Gonçalves hitting the post – as United struggled to find their legs. In a first half that barely featured anything worth noting, Copenhagen’s Elias Achouri tried to produce some magic with a nice run in from the left, only to drag his shot from range wide of the near post. Christian Eriksen replaced Sofyan Amrabat at half-time for United, but it was again the visitors who threatened first in the second half as a counter attack ended with Viktor Claesson setting up Lukas Lerager, who was denied by a good save from Onana. Former Liverpool goalkeeper Kamil Grabara made an equally impressive stop from Eriksen, though the Polish stopper was fortunate moments later to see a flag go up against Marcus Rashford after he brought the England international down in the area. The arrival of Eriksen did indeed make a difference though as it was his cross following a cleared corner in the 72nd minute that allowed Maguire to put United ahead with a header from close range. There was some late drama as Scott McTominay conceded a penalty in the last seconds of stoppage time, though it allowed Onana to make amends for some high-profile errors this season with an excellent save to his left to deny substitute Jordan Larsson from the spot. Manchester United ended a run of five Champions League games without a win (D2 L3), and Onana’s save also ensured their first clean sheet in the competition since their last victory in November 2021 (2-0 vs Villareal). Arsenal made hard work of their trip to Spain despite taking a two-goal lead after 53 minutes against Sevilla. Their three points at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan lifted them to first in Group B after PSV Eindhoven and Lens played out a 1-1 draw in the other game on Tuesday night. Gabriel Martinelli had the first clear chance of the night but was denied by the feet of Ørjan Nyland in a one-on-one. The Brazilian would have to wait until the final act of the first half to make amends. Gabriel Jesus sprung Martinelli free in the fourth minute of stoppage time at the end of the opening 45 and the winger made no mistake as he rounded Nyland and stroked it home to give Arsenal the lead. It was the first time two Brazilians have combined for a Champions League goal for Arsenal. Martinelli has now scored on his first start in the Champions League (vs Sevilla), Europa League (vs Standard Liège), Premier League (vs West Ham) and EFL Cup (vs Nottingham Forest) for Arsenal. It was the other Gabriel’s turn next time as Jesus picked the ball up on the right, cut inside and curled a peach beyond an outstretched Nyland. Sevilla gave themselves a lifeline when Nemanja Gudelj headed home a corner at the near post as the Sanchez Pizjuan and Sevilla came to life. With new manager, Diego Alonso, emptying the bench of every attacking threat he had, Sevilla threw caution to the wind. And they were almost rewarded. Arsenal rode their luck at times with Mariano Diaz rattling the crossbar, though he had handled the ball in the build-up. David Raya also punched a cross on to the top of his own net as Gunners fans begged for the final whistle. Lucas Ocampos had one last chance as time ran out but he blazed a shot wide from an awkward angle. During the final sprint to the finish, Arsenal fans watched as Jesus limped off with what looked like a hamstring injury, and they will now hold their breath over the striker’s fitness after he only just returned from a layoff. With 14 goals and four assists, Jesus has been involved in 18 goals in his last 17 starts in the Champions League, and is only the second player to score in his first three appearances for Arsenal in the competition, after Marouane Chamakh in 2010. Sevilla finished with 56.3% possession but Arsenal travel back to London with all three points. It was a Jude Bellingham goal that ultimately sealed the deal for Real Madrid against Braga on Tuesday night in Portugal. Let’s be honest, it’s always a Jude Bellingham goal that ultimately seals the deal for Real Madrid.  Carlo Ancelotti’s side remain perfect in this season’s Champions League with their third win in a row despite some nervy moments at the Estádio Municipal de Braga. Going into the game, Rodrygo had taken 41 shots for a total of 5.2 expected goals (xG), but only had one goal to show for his efforts. He improved that after 16 minutes on Tuesday night, though, when he finished from a Vinícius Júnior cross from the left. It was the Brazilians’ 16th goal in 42 games in the Champions League, just one fewer than he has managed in 118 LaLiga games (17). Jude Bellingham netted his 11th goal in 12 games for Real Madrid since joining in the summer on 61 minutes to give Madrid a two-goal cushion. Only Serhou Guirassy (15) and Lautaro Martínez (12) have scored more for a team in Europe’s big five leagues this season. His slick finish into the bottom corner of Braga’s net saw him equal Christian Karembeu with three goals in his first three games in the Champions League for Real Madrid. They are the only two players to achieve the feat in the club’s long and storied history in the competition. Any notions Real Madrid had of taking their foot off the pedal with the Clásico on the horizon were short-lived. Álvaro Djaló found himself free in the penalty area and he smashed home to cut Madrid’s lead in half. Ancelotti’s men weathered the storm as Braga grew increasingly desperate and brave as the game ticked on. There were 51 places in the Opta Power Rankings between these two teams at the start of the night, but you wouldn’t have known it from the trouble Braga caused the visitors late on. Real Madrid managed to hold out though and can now turn their attention to domestic affairs. They also sit atop La Liga and face Barcelona – who play Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday night in Group H – in a game that could see them extend their lead to four points over their Clásico rivals. Napoli sealed a second win in Group C in an unconvincing performance in Berlin, with Giacomo Raspadori scoring the only goal of a quiet game that saw a combined xG of just 0.69 (Union Berlin 0.44-0.25 Napoli). Union Berlin have lost their first three games in the Champions League this season, becoming only the second German team to lose their first three matches in the competition, following Schalke 04 in 2001-02. Union had faced their fair share of heartbreak in this season’s UCL, conceding stoppage-time goals to lose against both Real Madrid and Braga. The only side in the competition’s history to lose three such games in this manner in a single campaign is Dynamo Kyiv in 2003-04. Their fate was sealed a bit earlier this time, though. The Bundesliga side were denied a superb opener in the first half as Chelsea loanee David Datro Fofana went on a run down the right side before squaring to Janik Haberer to score a simple tap in, but the flag went up against Fofana for offside. Rani Khedira fired wide as Union continued to have the better of it in their first ever game against Italian opposition, with Fofana (1) the only player on the pitch to have a shot on target in the first half. It took until the 65th minute for Napoli to register their first shot on target, and it gave them the only goal of the game as good work from Khvicha Kvaratskhelia saw the Georgian maestro find Raspadori to finish at the near post. Raspadori joined a list of players born from 2000 onwards to have scored at least five goals in the last two Champions League seasons, along with Jude Bellingham, Rodrygo, Erling Haaland, Vinícius and Julián Álvarez. Since the start of last season, only Vinícius and Kevin De Bruyne (6 each) have provided more Champions League assists than Kvaratskhelia (5). Napoli sit second in the group, three points behind Real Madrid and three ahead of Braga, while Union remain pointless at the bottom. Despite both featuring so often in the European Cup/Champions League over the years, it may have surprised people that this was the first meeting between Galatasaray and Bayern Munich since the 1972-73 European Cup first round. The Turkish giants had not won at home in the competition since September 2018, going winless in their previous six, and despite a valiant effort in a game in which they were much the better side for an hour, that ultimately became winless in seven on Tuesday (D3 L4). Bayern were looking to win their opening three games of a Champions League campaign for the fifth consecutive year, having done so in every season since 2019-20. After beating Galatasaray, they have won each of their last eight away games in the group stage of the competition and are unbeaten in their last 19 away from home in the group stage (W17 D2). It was a bright start for the hosts, but it was Bayern who took the lead with their first attack. The Germans countered well with Jamal Musiala combining with Leroy Sané, who found Kingsley Coman in acres of space to his right. Coman had time to take a touch and fire low across Fernando Muslera into the far corner. Coman is now one of four players to score in each of the last seven Champions League seasons (since 2017-18) along with Robert Lewandowski, Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbappé. Kerem Aktürkoğlu – one of our players to keep an eye on before the competition began – forced Sven Ulreich into a superb reaction save moments later, before somehow skying an effort from point-blank range after Ulreich palmed across straight into his path. Galatasaray kept pushing and were rewarded just before the half-hour mark as Mauro Icardi went down under a challenge from Joshua Kimmich, resulting in a penalty. Icardi missed a spot kick in the 2-1 win at Manchester United on MD 2, which made his successful Panenka to make it 1-1 against Bayern feel all the cheekier. Okan Buruk’s men had 16 shots in the first half to Bayern’s three, the first time on record (since 2003-04) that Bayern had conceded 14 or more shots in the opening 45 minutes of a Champions League game. Galatasaray appeared to tire as the game went on, and that was all Bayern needed to edge back ahead. Musiala passed inside for Harry Kane, who needed two goes at it but eventually forced the ball in with just under 20 minutes remaining at Rams Park. It was the former Tottenham man’s 11th goal of the season for the Bundesliga champions. The victory was wrapped up in the 79th minute when Kane repaid the favour to Musiala, passing from the left to give the youngster a simple finish to make it 3-1 and put Bayern on nine points in Group A, with Galatasaray left on four. Inter Milan took a big step towards the knockout stages of the Champions League with a 2-1 win over Red Bull Salzburg at San Siro on Tuesday evening. Goals in either half from Alexis Sánchez and Hakan Çalhanoğlu did the job against the spirited and attacking young Austrian side. Sánchez became the top-scoring Chilean in Champions League history when he struck in the first half after a nice pass into the penalty area from Henrikh Mkhitaryan, which was inadvertently flicked on by Davide Frattesi. It was Sánchez’s 16th goal among Europe’s elite. With that strike, he overtook Arturo Vidal, who scored 15 during his time in Europe – hitting his UCL goals for Inter, Bayern Munich and Juventus. Sánchez has netted in the Champions League for Barcelona, Arsenal, Inter and Marseille. Salzburg’s young guns did level things through 19-year-old Oscar Gloukh after a sweeping move up the field but their grip on a draw soon slipped when Frattesi became the meat in a Lucas Gourna-Douath and Strahinja Pavlovic sandwich in the penalty area.  Up stepped Çalhanoğlu and the writing was on the wall. Çalhanoğlu has scored all nine of his attempts from the spot since joining Inter. It was the first penalty the Italians had scored at San Siro in the Champions League since 13 March 2012 when Giampaolo Pazzini netted from the spot against Marseille. Enjoy this?

4336,Cristiano Ronaldo misses training due to family reasons after telling Manchester United he wants a transfer,"Cristiano Ronaldo has failed to report back for pre-season training at Manchester United after telling club he wants to leave this summer.  The official explanation for his no-show was “family reasons,” which has been accepted by manager Erik ten Hag.  However, it is the latest development in Ronaldo's attempt to force exit during this transfer window – and causes major disruption just days before United are due to fly out to Thailand for the first leg of their summer tour.  Ronaldo is not in training today due to family reasons. #mufc have accepted his explanation and remain adamant he is not for sale Ronaldo has told Man Utd that he wants them to accept any reasonable offer for him, with the 37-year-old determined to move to a club in the Champions League.  He is dismayed by United’s decline and convinced he must move to ensure he can continue to challenge for the biggest honours.  The former Real Madrid and Juventus striker has made it clear that he does not believe they will be able to mount a realistic title challenge this season – and also has concerns over their ability to secure a top four finish. Ronaldo is in the twilight of his career and is adamant he wants to carry on playing at the highest level of the game - particularly the Champions League.  Not even the appointment of Ten Hag has persuaded him that Man Utd can quickly turn their fortunes around after enduring their worst ever Premier League campaign last season.  Ronaldo’s agent, Jorge Mendes, is said to have already been sounding out potential buyers, with Bayern Munich and Chelsea linked.  Sources believe Mendes may already have a suitor lined up, given the request for Man Utd to accept a bid.  While the rest of the club's international players were due to have their first meeting with Ten Hag at Carrington on Monday, the Portuguese legend's absence overshadowed events.  While Man Utd have accepted Ronaldo’s reasoning for missing the first day of pre-season, they insist he remains a key part of Ten Hag’s plans and is not for sale.   They have already missed out on top strike target Darwin Nunez this summer and have committed their budget to other areas of the squad.  While they intend to strengthen in attack, their focus is on Ajax winger Antony rather than an orthodox centre forward.  United’s other priority is central midfield, with Ten Hag closing in on a deal for top target Frenkie de Jong, while an offer has also been made to out-of-contract Christian Eriksen.  Feyenoord left back Tyrell Malacia was due to complete his medical on Monday ahead of becoming the first signing of the summer, while a bid has also been made for Ajax centre back Lisandro Martinez.

711,Watch: Dybala welcomed to Roma by 8000 fans in spine-tingling scenes at Square Colosseum,"Paulo Dybala received a glorious welcome to Roma on Tuesday as thousands of the Serie A side's fans turned out to see him. The Argentina star arrived at Rome's iconic Palazzo della Civilta Italiana, better known as the Square Colosseum, to give the capital club's supporters a first look at him in the famous Giallorossi jersey. Dybala made the switch to Jose Mourinho's side in a free transfer after leaving Juventus at the end of last season. Roma fans are jubilant about the arrival of the 28-year-old. Over the weekend, over 500,000 jerseys with his name and number were sold by the club shop, breaking a record for most shirts sold that had been set by Cristiano Ronaldo at Juventus. The supporters got their first up close and personal look at him in the Roma shirt at his official presentation, with 8000 spectators reportedly showing up to welcome the Argentine forward. Eccolo! 🤩💎 @PauDybala_JR x #ASRoma 🟨🟥 pic.twitter.com/e2L1f4oCfG It was a momentous occasion for Dybala himself, as he took a video of the Roma fans singing to him during the presentation. 💛💎🤳❤️ pic.twitter.com/ejWkOg5KD7 Roma were so eager to sign Dybala that he was offered the chance to wear the iconic No. 10 jersey that club legend Francesco Totti once held. However, the ex-Palermo attacker turned down the gesture and instead opted for No. 21. He said: ""The director had suggested that I take 10, which is very important here for what Totti has done. ""That shirt must still be his. I thanked them, because for such a shirt there must be respect and responsibility. ""Maybe one day I'll wear it, but today I'm happy with 21.""

10549,"Saka, Rodri, Martinelli, De Bruyne: Will Arsenal or Man City Feel Their Injuries More?","Arsenal host Manchester City this weekend in a match that pitches two Premier League title contenders together. Both sides will likely be missing several important players through injury and suspension, but what impact will those absences have on the game? We use the data to investigate. For such a young player, Bukayo Saka has played a lot of football. And we mean a lot. His last Premier League appearance against Bournemouth was his 142nd overall, and aged 22 years and 25 days old at the time, Saka became the seventh-youngest Premier League player in history to hit that number of games. The youngest? Wayne Rooney, who was exactly a year younger than Saka when he played his 142nd game, and someone whose powers waned in his late twenties. Mikel Arteta really hasn’t had to contend with the prospect of Saka not being available for selection. In Arteta’s three full seasons to date, Saka has never featured in fewer than 90% of Arsenal’s matches and has now played in 87 consecutive Premier League games – the longest current streak of all Premier League players and the longest streak ever in Arsenal’s club history. But with Saka limping off after barely half an hour against Lens in the Champions League, there’s real concern Arteta will be without his young talisman for their crunch game against Manchester City. To say Saka’s loss would be a huge blow is an understatement. He’s flourished into one of the most dangerous wingers in world football, and someone who is such a consistent source of goals (both scoring and creating) for Arsenal. Since Arteta’s arrival, Saka has more goals (41) and assists (36) in all competitions than any other Arsenal player. His assist for Jesus in France in midweek made him the first player to record 5+ goals and 5+ assists in all competitions this season for a team in Europe’s big five leagues. He is such an all-round dual threat. There’s a strong argument to say that Saka, and his position on the right-wing, is the only area in the squad where Arsenal still do not have a suitable back-up. They have considerable depth from the left (Gabriel Martinelli, Leandro Trossard, Reiss Nelson) and down the middle (Gabriel Jesus and Eddie Nketiah), but no one naturally suited to fill Saka’s void. Fabio Vieira replaced Saka in the Champions League on Tuesday, but he’s a very different type of player: a slower, more considered passing playmaker compared to the direct and speedy goal threat Saka offers. What Arsenal will miss the most is Saka’s direct threat in one-on-one matchups, and his ability to beat his opposite man. He ran Destiny Udogie ragged in the opening exchanges of the north London derby, and although the Spurs full-back recovered admirably as the game wore on, it was a glimpse into the danger Saka can pose all on his own. Saka has been involved in more one-one-one situations (101) than anyone else in the league so far this season and has both attempted and completed more take-ons than any Arsenal player. That direct threat will be massively missed. In the short term, assuming that Saka will indeed miss this weekend’s match, the likelihood is that Jesus will be pushed to the right wing, with Nketiah starting centrally. Should Saka miss out, then Arsenal will feel the absence of Gabriel Martinelli even more keenly. Martinelli hasn’t appeared for Arsenal since limping off against Everton last month with a hamstring injury. The Brazilian still hasn’t returned to training, so his inclusion against the league leaders this weekend looks unlikely. Without both Saka and Martinelli, Arsenal will lack real explosiveness in wide areas. Martinelli is Arsenal’s fastest player – his top speed of 34.7 km/h is faster than any teammate has clocked this season – and without him, Arsenal offer significantly less threat in behind. Martinelli has averaged 11.5 runs into the opposition attacking third so far for Arsenal this season, more than any Arsenal regular, and the graphic below shows how many of those runs have been from out-to-in down the left. Against Lens, Arsenal often lacked an incisive, penetrative option in behind, with their wingers preferring to drift wide or receive the ball to feet. In the example below, Nelson pulls out wide and asks for the ball to be played to him. Jesus is occupying his marker and so Nelson would have been free to run into the space, stretching the defence. Manchester City won’t defend as deep against Arsenal as Lens did but exploiting the spaces down the sides of City – which can become narrow in their 3-2 shape – is crucial. Without Saka and Martinelli, that becomes a lot more difficult. Despite of the vast sums of money City have spent in recent years and the incredible squad Pep Guardiola has put together, they are somehow in the barely believable position of being totally and utterly reliant on their defensive midfielder. No Rodri, no party for Pep. In the last two summers, City have spent approximately £128 million on central midfield options in Matheus Nunes, Mateo Kovacic and Kalvin Phillips, while they also have full-backs perfectly comfortable inverting into midfield, such as Rico Lewis. And yet they have scarcely looked less like they have an alternative to Rodri in that position. Part of the problem with Rodri is that he is almost always available – he has only missed 15 of the 159 Premier League games City have played since he joined – so there is very little chance for them to get used to playing without him. It showed last weekend. The 2-1 defeat to Wolves, in which City had a lot of pallid possession (68%) but little in the way of clear-cut chances (0.87 xG in total), was the latest game the Spaniard had missed, and City were way off their best. Their record in games he has missed is genuinely awful. They have lost 33% (five) of the 15 Premier League matches he has missed compared to 13.2% when he plays. They win 60% of the time when he is missing, compared to 74.3% with him. They concede 1.1 goals per game without him compared to 0.8 when he plays. The 15 games he has missed makes up only a small sample size, but the difference on the pitch is so stark that his absence is worthy of note – it clearly makes a massive difference to City both in and out of possession. That much was laid bare at Molineux, and they face a much better side – though stylistically very different – in Arsenal this weekend. With Rodri missing, it should be easier for Arsenal to keep City at bay, while they could also look to threaten on transition more than they might usually. That was the key to Wolves’ win and could be crucial in this game, too. When Kevin Be Bruyne suffered a recurrence of the hamstring injury that forced him out of last season’s Champions League final in the opening Premier League game of this campaign, everyone else harbouring title ambitions – namely Arsenal – spotted an opportunity. This was the kind of long-term absence that might level the playing field ever so slightly. Guardiola described his talismanic midfielder as “irreplaceable”, and it was hard to disagree with him. But now, seven games into 2023-24, City are top of the Premier League and remain huge favourites to win the league, and thus become the first team ever to win four successive English top-flight titles. Although they could of course have done with De Bruyne at Wolves, their run of six wins from six to start the season – the joint-third best start by any team to a Premier League campaign – with the Belgian missing suggests that it wasn’t specifically his absence that was the problem at Molineux. Unlike Rodri, De Bruyne is prone to injury and regularly misses chunks of a season, so Guardiola will likely always have an alternative plan up his sleeve. This season, his replacement has been Júlian Álvarez, who has ensured City have not felt the void left by De Bruyne. As detailed on these pages last week, Álvarez has been dropping deeper and has been much more involved in build-up play than last season, playing off Erling Haaland rather than as his replacement up front. He has been a huge goal threat, with only four other players having had more shots (22) or shots on target (10) than him in Premier League games this season, while providing creativity as well, ranking fifth for both chances created (19) and chances created from open play (14). He is no De Bruyne but he has done a decent impression of late, and this week he came off the bench to score one and set up another in the win at RB Leipzig. That said, De Bruyne is a big-game player, and the impact he has on games like this one will be particularly difficult to replicate. He raised his game for the biggest occasions (when injury didn’t force him off) last season, most notably and relevantly against Arsenal in what were almost, at the time at least, two title play-offs. Over his 167 minutes on the pitch across those two meetings, De Bruyne scored three goals and provided two assists. That accounted for 21.7% of his Premier League goal contributions for the season in just 6.9% of his game time. Against their main title rivals. This weekend’s game against Arsenal could therefore be the worst one for Guardiola to be without De Bruyne, and his absence should be a huge boost for Arsenal. Remember John Stones? You know the one, he was so good last season that they named an entirely new role after him. Stones last appeared on a football pitch in the Community Shield at the start of August. He played 90 minutes at Wembley but has been missing ever since with a hip injury that has dragged on infuriatingly for both Stones and his manager. He may be back on Sunday, having made his return to the matchday squad at Leipzig on Wednesday, though it may still be too soon for him to go back into the starting XI. Particularly in the absence of Rodri, Stones’ ability to step into midfield could have been especially useful. Guardiola doesn’t really have any established senior member of the squad (sorry Rico Lewis) available to play a hybrid defender-defensive midfielder role. Manuel Akanji was tested there in midweek, but it wasn’t a wholly convincing display, and having Stones back could have been a huge boost to Guardiola’s hopes of playing his preferred system. Stones, in that role, was integral to the two wins over Arsenal last season and to the entire run of form that saw City storm to the treble. In the 20 games at the end of 2022-23 after Stones switched to that hybrid role, City conceded 0.5 goals per game, down from 0.9 per game before that. This season, with Stones entirely absent, City’s opponents have been able to progress up the pitch at an average speed of 1.38 m/s – the seventh highest in the Premier League – which represents a 16% increase on their Premier League low of 1.19 m/s last season. Those differences can’t be attributed wholly to Stones’ presence, or lack thereof, and City’s results so far this season show that they have managed well without him. But whenever he does make his return, his team will be far better for it. How do you think this game will do down?

10643,Tottenham vs Sheffield United: Prediction and Preview,"In a Premier League match between two teams at opposite ends of the table, Spurs will be hoping to continue their impressive start on Saturday. Look ahead to the game with our Tottenham vs Sheffield United prediction and preview. After a change in management and the departure of talisman Harry Kane, most Tottenham Hotspur fans would have rejoiced in pre-season if they had been offered second place in the Premier League at the first international break of the campaign. That lofty position is where manager Ange Postecoglou has led Spurs and if his side can dispatch Sheffield United in a home match on Saturday as club football returns, they will take enormous momentum into crucial upcoming fixtures with rivals Arsenal and fellow top-four contenders Liverpool. Confidence is high at Tottenham after a thumping 5-2 win at Burnley last time out and it is another side recently promoted from the Championship who they now face, with this contest against Sheffield United only Spurs’ second at home this season. Spurs have scored two or more goals in each of their four top-flight games under Postecoglou. If they repeat that again here, the Australian will be the first EPL boss since Maurizio Sarri at Chelsea in 2018 to achieve that feat in their first five matches in the competition – an accomplishment also reached by Carlo Ancelotti, Pep Guardiola and Craig Shakespeare. Sheffield United have been in tight matches over the opening weeks of the season, even running champions Manchester City close in Matchday 3. Rodri had to score a late winner to preserve a 100% start for Guardiola’s men after Erling Haaland had earlier missed a penalty and then scored before Jayden Bogle equalised. The Blades are yet to be beaten by more than one goal but will be disappointed to have only collected one point from those close opening four matches, especially having led relegation rivals Everton in their previous fixture before having to settle for a dramatic 2-2 draw. That was their first draw in 28 Premier League games. Spurs hope defender Cristian Romero, who is battling a thigh injury, will be passed fit. The Argentina international has scored two Premier League goals in four matches this season after only netting once in his first 49, with his fine strike against Burnley being one to savour. Even more crucial to Spurs achieving victory could be attacking midfielder James Maddison, who has made a flying start to the season that resulted in him being named as a starter for England in their Euro 2024 qualifier against Ukraine. Since the start of 2021-22, Maddison has racked up 43 Premier League goal involvements, scoring 24 times and adding 19 assists, all the more impressive given he spent most of that time playing for Leicester City, who were relegated last season. The only two English players with more combined goals and assists in the Premier League during that time are Tottenham great Kane (59) and Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka (46), with Maddison hoping to make it three top-flight matches in a row with a goal when he takes to the field against the Blades. Yves Bissouma has also thrived across the opening weeks, making an impact at both ends of the pitch in Postecoglou’s system after struggling to carve out his place in the side under Antonio Conte. As for Sheff Utd, Cameron Archer is a player to watch after his strike against Everton last time out. Only once before have the club had a player score in both of his first two Premier League appearances for them, and that was Brian Deane way back in the first season of the competition in 1992-93. Tottenham do not have fond memories of the last fixture between the two sides, as Sheffield United defeated Spurs 1-0 at Bramall Lane in March to dump them out of the FA Cup in the fifth round. Iliman Ndiaye, who has since joined Marseille, scored an impressive winning goal in the closing stages as Spurs produced a lacklustre performance, with the introduction of Kane from the bench not enough to save them. The last two Premier League meetings are more positive recollections for Spurs, performances they will look to replicate when we reach kick-off at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. In the 2020-21 season, Spurs won 3-1 away and their last home fixture against the Blades was a 4-0 victory in May 2021. Gareth Bale was the Tottenham hero that day, scoring a hat-trick against already relegated Sheff Utd, with Son Heung-min also netting in an impressive outing as Spurs were led by interim manager Ryan Mason. The league double that season ended what had been a poor Tottenham record in recent fixture history, as they had only won twice against Sheff Utd in the 11 meetings which came before. Having said that, the Blades have always been more of a threat in home matches against Spurs than on their travels. Their last win at Tottenham came way back in November 1991. Son has previously scored in this fixture and his hat-trick at Burnley added further to his impressive record against promoted sides. The South Korean forward has been directly involved in 31 goals in his last 31 Premier League appearances against such teams, with 21 goals and 10 assists. The former Golden Boot winner is hoping to become the eighth player in Premier League history to score a hat-trick in successive appearances. It may not surprise you to learn that the previous star to achieve the feat was Haaland for Man City in August 2022. Since an entertaining draw at Brentford on the opening weekend, Tottenham have defeated Manchester United, Bournemouth and Burnley in convincing fashion, scoring nine goals and conceding just two across those three contests. A penalty shootout defeat to Fulham in the Carabao Cup has been their only setback to date, but an emphatic response against Burnley, which included the treble from Son, meant Spurs sprinted into the international break. Sheffield United got their first point of the campaign against Everton, but it has been a frustrating start, with Paul Heckingbottom also seeing his side crash out of the cup at the same stage as Spurs when they lost on penalties to League One outfit Lincoln City. A win for Tottenham in north London would see them move on to 13 points from their opening five matches, which would be their best-ever start in the Premier League era and their fastest opening to a top-flight season for 58 years. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta supercomputer does not believe an upset is likely based on its Tottenham vs Sheffield United prediction. Spurs are strong favourites with a 58.9% chance of victory according to our model, while Sheffield United are down at 16.2%. Given the form of the two teams coming into this Premier League fixture, the Blades would likely be glad to take a draw, which is given a 24.9% chance. In terms of the overall Premier League season, the Opta supercomputer has simulated the campaign 10,000 times and looked at the longer-term predictions for both teams. Tottenham’s impressive start to the campaign has significantly improved their projection based on the pre-season. Their overall chance of a top-four finish in the standings is now 32.0%, which has rocketed up from 9.5% when the campaign started. Tottenham fans will enjoy learning that their most likely finishing position is rated as fourth, which they achieve in 17.8% of simulations, though there is still a wide range of outcomes for Spurs, who finish in every position between third and eighth at least 9% of the time. It looks like an intense battle for UEFA Champions League qualification as the likes of Liverpool, Arsenal, Newcastle United, Manchester United and Brighton lie ahead. The simulator is not as enjoyable viewing for supporters of Sheffield United. Their relegation odds were already worrying at 49.0% at the start of the campaign and that chance has now gone up to 64.8%. Sheff Utd finish bottom of the table in 25.7% of our projections, with only Luton Town (28.4%) faring worse in that regard. Enjoy this?

6146,Manchester City complete £14m transfer of River Plate star Julian Alvarez,"Manchester City have completed the £14 million ($18m) signing of River Plate forward Julian Alvarez on a five-and-a-half-year contract. The Argentina international, who turned 22 on transfer deadline day, will remain on loan at River until July at least. Alvarez, who scored 20 goals in 35 league appearances for River last season as well as registering nine assists, was a target for a host of European clubs, including Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona. “Julian is a player we have monitored for some time,” City's director of football Txiki Begiristain said. “He is capable of operating in a number of attacking roles, and we firmly believe he's one of the best young attacking players in South America. “I am so happy we have managed to bring him to Manchester City. I really believe we can provide him with the right conditions to fulfil his potential and become a top player.” City believe they are buying a player with a huge potential, with Alvarez considered one of Argentina’s most promising young stars. Manchester City have signed a striker!Julian Alvarez has joined Man City from River Plate 📝 pic.twitter.com/uQmCh7GsFR He has already made six appearances for the national team in World Cup qualifiers and Copa America, and his playing style has drawn comparisons with City legend Sergio Aguero. He spent two years at Real Madrid's academy as a youngster but was unable to sign for them as he was under the age of 13. After returning to Argentina with River, he made his professional debut in 2018 and has 36 goals in 96 appearances and was understood to have a release clause in his contract worth £17m ($23m). Mainly a striker, Alvarez can play anywhere across the front three and was used as a right winger in Argentina's 0-0 draw with Brazil in November. He is set to stay at River until the summer before meeting up with his new team-mates in pre-season. Alvarez could be ready to be part of Pep Guardiola's squad for the new campaign, but the club are set to keep an open mind over his future. There is the possibility that he could be sent out on loan to a sister club that is part of the City Football Group. City are likely to buy a main striker before the start of the new season, having missed out on Tottenham's Harry Kane as a replacement for Aguero, with Borussia Dortmund's Erling Haaland a potential target.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/manchester-city-complete-gbp14m-transfer-river-plate-star-julian-/blt6079e04f26225069,Jonathan Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7830,Roy Keane reveals the one reason he KNEW Gary Neville was going to name Maguire,"Roy Keane implied Gary Neville has a bias when selecting the player of the match after Man United's win against Aston Villa.  Erik ten Hag's side picked up what could prove to be a vital victory at Villa Park and in doing so moved themselves within six points of fourth-placed Tottenham in the race for Champions League football. Harry Maguire started alongside Raphael Varane in United's seemingly ever-rotating defence and had an immediate impact, winning a header from a corner to find Rasmus Hojlund. The young forward has been prolific since finally opening his Premier League account on Boxing Day, and he netted to give the visitors the lead after 17 minutes. Andre Onana produced one of his best performances to date in a Manchester United shirt throughout the first half, producing two crucial saves to maintain their lead into the interval.  Villa were persistent though, and their efforts were rewarded when Douglas Luiz equalised on the hour mark. Scott McTominay has been in a rich vein of form in front of goal this season and the Scotsman duly delivered to secure victory in dramatic fashion. Neville named Maguire the Player of the Match for his efforts, and while Keane admitted the England international was solid at the heart of defence, he insisted some partisanship on behalf of the former United defender could be at play. 'I thought he did alright today, obviously some lads give defenders Man of the Match because they've been defenders themselves - that type of scenario. It was definitely going to be a defender.' Keane said on Sky Sports. Asked who he would've chosen in place of Maguire for the award the former Republic of Ireland international continued: 'No big deal about that but we've praised the defenders considered the amount of chances Villa had. 'Winning Man of the Match the bottom line is it's no big deal, what's important for Maguire is he's getting games under his belt and he's getting back up to speed. 'He's a good, solid, experienced defender. The problems are still there for Man United, they got away with it today because the attacking players are scoring goals.' Maguire has enjoyed a renaissance at United in recent weeks particularly given how bleak his future at the club appeared this summer. Amid significant discotent across the club's fanbase, the 30-year-old was stripped of the captaincy in July, and, like McTominay, was repeatedly linked with a move to West Ham having fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford.    A series of injuries provided an opportunity to return to first-team action however, and the former Hull City star made nine consecutive league starts before being curtailed with an injury of his own in December. Since then though Maguire has returned to action in good form, and has featured in the club's last three Premier League games. With eleven Premier League starts this campaign Maguire has already surpassed his tally for the previous season, and Lisandro Martinez's recent injury likely provide him with an extended spell in the starting XI.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Roy-Keane-reveals-the-one-reason-he-KNEW-Gary-Neville-was-going-to-name-Maguire/3300680,,12-Feb,all-football-app

Again, he is the captain. He should stay with the team no matter what, even if he only had one leg to stand on.“He even said himself that it’s the Egyptian national team, not Salah’s national team, and this is true.

8279,"Neymar to ‘play for Al-Hilal’ in Saudi Arabia, deal underway for PSG transfer: Report","Sources close to the Parisian club have revealed to Agence France-Presse (AFP) that Neymar, at 31 years old, is seemingly no longer a part of PSG's future plans. The Brazilian sensation, known for his dazzling skills on the field, has been swiftly linked to Al-Hilal in the Gulf region.

With an illustrious history that includes four Asian Champions League victories, Al-Hilal is primed to make an indelible mark on the football landscape.    (With AFP inputs)

 al-hilal vs al-shabab If this remarkable switch indeed takes place, Neymar will join the ranks of other football luminaries drawn to Saudi Arabia's lucrative football scene. Cristiano Ronaldo's move to Al-Nassr earlier in 2023 set the precedent, and now Neymar could follow suit. As the thrilling saga unfolds, Al-Hilal's potential coup of Neymar could further bolster their status as one of Saudi Arabia's premier clubs.

5873,"Man Utd need to 'get over' Sir Alex Ferguson, says Chicharito - but insists Ronaldo could still score 40 goals this year","Los Angeles Galaxy star Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez has called on former club Manchester United to ""get over"" ex-manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who retired in 2013. The Red Devils have failed to replicate the success they enjoyed under Ferguson as they've cycled through eight managers, including caretakers, since the Scottish legend's exit. Hernandez believes ""it is never going to be the same"" club without Ferguson, but thinks an acceptance of a new era would help them move forward. “United need to get over the fact that Sir Alex Ferguson has gone,"" Hernandez told reporters. “Would we like to have someone similar? Yes, yes, yes - but Sir Alex has gone and it is never going to be the same. “It doesn't surprise me what has happened at United because in life it’s not easy having a manager for 26 years in the way that Sir Alex did it. “One of his greatest aptitudes, in my humble opinion, was that probably seven out of 10 players who signed worked out. “That’s not easy - not for Real Madrid or Barcelona or even for Chelsea, (Manchester) City, Liverpool or Bayern Munich. “It is like winning the lottery. Do you think anyone you hire afterwards is going to be able to do even 80 percent of what Ferguson did?” Hernandez said he understands Cristiano Ronaldo's desire to leave Manchester United this summer given their lack of Champions League qualification. Still, he believes Ronaldo could have a huge season if he remains with the club. “Time will tell what is going to happen with him - but what if Ronaldo stays and scores 40 goals?"" Hernandez said. ""That could happen.” “If United came for me then I’d say ‘yes, I’ll play for free.’ Of course, you know, I’d do that,"" Hernandez said. “I also want to be very respectful to my club. I am playing very consistently and in my mind my conviction is all about winning a championship with LA Galaxy. “In the future, if things happen then they happen - but in my mind I am 100 percent with LA.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-sir-alex-ferguson-chicharito-ronaldo-40-goals/blt0ca430b2621bb275,Dan Bernstein,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4450,Explained: Why Atletico Madrid won't give Real Madrid a guard of honour,"Why won't Atletico Madrid give Real Madrid a guard of honour when they clash at Wanda Metropolitano? GOAL is here to provide you with all the details. Atletico were officially dethroned as reigning La Liga champions on April 30, 2022, as Real Madrid thrashed Espanyol 4-0 at Santiago Bernabeu to clinch the trophy with four games to spare. The Blancos' will play their first game as champions at the home stadium of their arch-rivals, who are set to break with the tradition of clapping the opposition onto the pitch out of respect for their title success. Atletico have released a statement explaining why they won't give Madrid a guard of honour at Wanda Metropolitano on May 8, 2022. ""Some people want to turn what began as a gesture of recognition for the champions into a public toll that their rivals must pay, imbued with the scent of humiliation,"" the club statement reads. ""Atletico Madrid will under no circumstances collaborate in this attempt at ridicule in which the true values of sport are completely forgotten and tension and confrontation between fans are incited."" Atletico also claimed that they have been unfairly criticised for their decision while citing Celta Vigo's reluctance to clap their players onto the pitch following their 2020-21 La Liga success. ""Atleti are the last league champions. Does anyone remember any controversy about whether we should receive a guard of honour from our first opponents after winning the title? No, because there was no debate,"" the club added. ""In the first match of this season, Celta Vigo decided not to give a guard of honour and it was the right decision, because they are gestures that should be done to be applauded by the home crowd... We received the guard of honour in the first game we played at home, from Elche. Naturally, gratefully and, obviously, without any demands."" Jose Gimenez suggests Atletico Madrid won't give Real Madrid a guard of honour 👀 pic.twitter.com/50BelCju2R The suggestion that Atletico would snub the guard of honour tradition was initially raised after their 2-0 defeat to Athletic Club, which came on the same day Madrid clinched their 35th La Liga crown. Atletico defender Jose Gimenez said when quizzed on a potential tribute: ""A guard of honour to Real Madrid? We congratulate them, but we have a lot of respect for our fans."" The club's number one goalkeeper and captain, Jan Oblak, also expressed his disapproval of the guard of honour. ""As captain, I'm one of those who doesn't like to give or receive the guard of honour,"" said Oblak. ""The club will decide and we'll do whatever is necessary."" Simeone is 100 per cent behind Atletico's decision not to approve a guard of honour, mainly out of respect to the club's fanbase. ""The reality is what the club said in a press release, explaining perfectly, congratulating Real Madrid above all, the footballers, the technical staff, because they have done a great job,"" the Atletico boss said at a press conference. ""We have respect for Madrid but more for our people. “I don't know if this is represented in other world championships. Each society is different. The Spanish one has this guard of honour for their rivals, [but] as an example, where I come from I don't use it. We live differently too."" Meanwhile, Simeone's opposite number, Carlo Ancelotti, has also played down the significance of the gesture. ""The Italians aren't used to [the guard of honour],"" the Madrid manager said ahead of the derby. ""Atletico Madrid are a club we respect a lot, they're our neighbour and our friend. ""I have a lot of respect for the players, the fans and the coach. If they do it, great. If not, it doesn't matter."" Should Atletico give Real Madrid a guard of honour?

6448,From Liverpool's title hopes to Man Utd's top-four challenge: Premier League predictions,"A three-week break from Premier League action provides a welcome breather in what has been an unusually chaotic season.  Winter is nearly over and the pandemic, we hope, has done its worst, so when the action returns in February there should be a clear schedule just in time for the 'business end' of the campaign. The table itself is pretty hard to read at the moment, not only because there is such a disparity between the number of games clubs have played but because we have had a lot of managerial changes.  With that in mind, and with most clubs now in a settled pattern for the next few months, here's a prediction, based on tactical analysis, of how the 2021-22 Premier League season will end... Manchester City may be nine points clear, but the lead is more precarious than it looks. With Liverpool playing City in mid-March, Jurgen Klopp's side just need to out-perform their rivals by three points in the eight games before then to arrive at the Etihad with the opportunity to pull level at the top. For that to happen, we need a few tactical sidenotes to become more prominent. For Man City, their 1-1 draw with Southampton on Saturday was further evidence that they can be made to look sluggish.  A deeper block, that gives the centre-backs time on the ball but surrounds Rodri, can force City into stale possession, particularly because they lack a centre-forward to make penetrative runs in behind. Jack Grealish's deployment as a false nine ensured that everything was in front of the Southampton defenders, simplifying their jobs.  The same thing happened in the reverse fixture, and also to some extent in City's one-goal wins against West Ham, Aston Villa, Brentford, and Wolves. A bit more luck, and all four of these teams could have taken a point, changing the whole shape of the title battle. For Liverpool's part, they need to stay injury-free. Thiago Alcantara's press-resistant possession and pinpoint passing in the opposition half is essential to Liverpool remaining in control of matches. They are vulnerable to counterattacks without him, as evidenced by the fact they have won 28 points from 11 league games with Thiago this season, and 20 points from 11 league games without him. Should he and Fabinho have a consistent run in the team, then Liverpool can put together the kind of winning streak they need.  Add to that Harvey Elliot's anticipated return in February – his ability to link the midfield and attack gave them a whole new dimension at the start of the season – and just maybe the 2021-22 title race isn't over. Chelsea's win against Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United's against West Ham has confirmed that the Premier League has a straight three-horse race for the fourth Champions League spot.  All three of Man Utd, Spurs and Arsenal are in various states of transition and all have glaring tactical flaws, but of the three Antonio Conte's side possess the discipline to come out on top. Putting aside the baffling use of a defensive 4-4-2 at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, an experiment Conte will surely abandon when action resumes next month, Tottenham have quickly adopted some of the core principles of the Italian's tactical philosophy.  Most notably, they have taken on an urgency in possession and solid defensive compression when the ball is lost, making Tottenham surprisingly tough to beat. However, they lack creativity, largely because right wing-back Emerson Royal cannot take advantage of being the free man in attack (Conte deliberately pulls play over to one side before suddenly switching to an unmarked wing-back on the other side).  The absence of a Cesc Fabregas or Christian Eriksen in the midfield two also means Spurs are too flat when attempting to build through the lines. Nevertheless, they are in a stronger shape than Man Utd, with Ralf Rangnick dialling down his own tactical preferences week by week.  He was right to abandon the 4-2-2-2, a shape too square for a side forced to dominate possession, and the move to a more conventional 4-2-3-1 has steadied the ship.  But that comes at the cost of individualism again taking precedence at Old Trafford. That is not a recipe for consistent form across the final three months of the season. Arsenal are similarly prone to moments of madness, to performances that lurch backwards, and indeed have followed a five-game winning streak through December with a five-game winless run.  In Mikel Arteta’s defence, this hasn’t been a tactical flaw but rather a lack of bodies, and when play resumes in February, Arsenal should be back to full strength. This season, full strength means playing an intelligent and positionally-fluid 4-3-3 formation that closely mimics Pep Guardiola.  Their first-half performance in the 2-1 defeat to Manchester City was the best example yet of what a confrontational and tactically disciplined Arsenal can look like, with Thomas Partey and Martin Odegaard emerging as the linchpins of the side. However, the way Arsenal collapsed in the second half showed Arteta’s tactical coaching is undermined by self-doubt, by a psychological brittleness that takes hold as soon as Arsenal have one or two key absences.  For that reason, Conte’s Spurs are likely to grind their way to more points. Watford had just started to understand the necessity of a conservative off-the-ball shape, had just started to show humility by camping deeper and counter-attacking with some success through their talented wingers, when they decided to sack their manager. Xisco was unlucky to go when he did. His replacement Claudio Ranieri failed spectacularly. That original model is about to be reinstated as Roy Hodgson prepares to take over and install his usual defensive 4-4-2 formation. There is perhaps enough quality in attack to make it work, although Hodgson has a far weaker central midfield than the powerful one he built at Crystal Palace.  Certainly, Hodgson’s surprise appointment would appear to be the final straw for Burnley, who look out of ideas.  Weakened by the loss of Chris Wood and having so many games packed into the final few months, Sean Dyche surely won’t get them out of trouble this time. But both clubs will probably go down, and out of the four battling against the drop perhaps Norwich City are the most likely to get out of trouble.  Their back-to-back wins in January were characterised by a stark tactical shift from manager Dean Smith, who moved away from Norwich’s woefully expansive possession system to a deep line and frustration tactics. It is exactly the change in strategy we saw from Smith towards the end of the 2019-20 season at Aston Villa, an ultra-defensive move that won seven points from the final three matches.   He has the experience to pull this off, especially considering Newcastle United are unlikely to miraculously improve their defensive structure under Eddie Howe, whose Bournemouth team always conceded a lot of goals. Even signing the likes of Aaron Ramsey or Dele Alli probably won’t be enough. What Newcastle need even more than new signings is a tactical system that balances their adventurous instincts with compression between the lines.  Howe never managed that at Bournemouth. His Newcastle team will remain vulnerable through to May.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-title-hopes-man-utd-top-four-challenge-premier/blt6944a5b310bbeb39,Alex Keble,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5900,Dessers on target for Feyenoord in Europa Conference League despite Super Eagles snub,"Nigeria international Cyriel Dessers was on target yet again as Feyenoord defeated Partizan 3-1 to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa Conference League on Thursday. The 27-year-old, who was overlooked by Nigeria coach Augustine Eguavoen ahead of their 2022 World Cup qualifying play-off fixture against Ghana later this month, opened the scoring for the home team at Feyenoord Stadium in the 45th minute. Reiss Nelson, who is on loan from Arsenal then made it 2-0 in the 59th minute before Partizan pulled a goal back courtesy of Ricardo Jorge Pires Gomes in the 61st minute. However, second-half substitute Bryan Linssen ensured Feyenoord won the Round of 16 fixture with a fine strike in the 90th minute. The outcome of the game ensured Feyenoord qualified with a convincing 8-3 aggregate score after having won the first leg 5-2 away from home. Dessers, who is on loan from Belgian side Genk, has now scored in four straight games. While he has so far managed six goals in the Eredivisie, he has also scored five goals in the Europa Conference tournament after seven matches making it 13 goals in all competitions. In a recent interview, Nigeria coach Eguavoen shed light on why he omitted Dessers from his squad for the Black Stars game. “There are plans. Talking about Cyriel Dessers where is he playing? NPFL? The answer is no so am I going to take a train from here to Holland, the answer is no, so the time has to be right,” Eguavoen said. “When I say I haven't watched the players I'm talking about having watched them live. On television, of course, I follow. That brings me back to Peter [Etebo] whom I have worked closely with, I have seen, interacted with.” The first leg meeting between the Super Eagles and the Black Stars will be staged at Kumasi Yara Sports Stadium on March 25. This is after Caf confirmed the unavailability of Cape Coast Stadium to host the game. Nigeria will then host the second leg at the MKO Abiola Stadium in Abuja, with the winners on aggregate qualifying for the global football showpiece.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/dessers-on-target-for-feyenoord-in-europa-conference-league/bltf02ee47156baa538,Dennis Mabuka,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1843,'Man Utd could write a book on how not to do transfers' – Fowler rips into Red Devils as Liverpool close on Nunez,"Liverpool appear set to win the race for Benfica striker Darwin Nunez, with GOAL confirming the Reds are confident of beating arch-rivals Manchester United to a £75 million ($94m) deal. Robbie Fowler has taken great delight in pointing out that the Red Devils “could write a book on how not to do transfers”. Those at Old Trafford appear set to be left empty-handed in the pursuit of the highly-rated Uruguay international who scored 34 goals for Portuguese heavyweights last season. Man Utd missed out on a top-four finish again during the 2021-22 campaign, and former Reds striker Fowler believes lessons from Merseyside need to be heeded by those in Manchester. Fowler told The Mirror: “With the record signing of Darwin Nunez looking all but done for Liverpool, what fascinates me is the presence of Manchester United amid the negotiations. “I can guarantee the Anfield people would have been uneasy with that, as it has the potential to push up not only the price, but the wages too. No agent worth his salt wouldn’t use it to get a bigger contract, let’s be clear. “Man Utd being there in the background - for me - highlights just why this could so easily be another masterstroke for Liverpool in the transfer market, and it’s a point that is so often overlooked in the desperation to see new faces, new signings, new excitement. “I don’t want to be cruel, but Man Utd could have written a book on how not to do transfers in recent seasons. Signing players just because you don’t want them to go to a rival? Check and double check. “Cristiano [Ronaldo] has done his job well enough, but signing him because he could have gone to Man City? That just had disaster written all over it. The same with Alexis Sanchez. No, not the same, 10 times worse. “That deal highlights everything that has been wrong at Old Trafford. How much did it cost? About 500 grand a week in wages, which I saw somewhere cost them about 20 million quid a goal! “Much, much worse though, was that it didn’t just break Man Utd's pay structure, it shattered it. That’s how a goalkeeper [David de Gea] can end up on £400,000 a week, and a midfielder like [Paul] Pogba who couldn’t even get in the team half the time on even more.” Manchester United don't wish to enter a bidding war with Liverpool for Darwin Nunez, they are ready to move on to other targets 🗞 pic.twitter.com/1bp55UXrU8 The Reds are moving for Nunez, having already snapped up Colombian winger Luis Diaz in January, as questions continue to be asked of how long Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah will be at Anfield. The Senegalese star continues to see a summer move to Bayern Munich speculated, while the Egyptian talisman is yet to extend a contract that is due to expire in 2023. Fowler added on Liverpool moving to bring in reinforcements: “You can see the thinking with Darwin Nunez. Mane is 30, he’s 22. Selling Mane could raise around £40m, and Nunez cost £80m. But. And this is a significant but... “He’ll most likely be on less than half the wages Mane was asking for. Which over the course of a five year contract could save them all of that extra £40m. On top of that, it doesn’t break the wage structure. “Looking at it that way, replacing a 30 year old with a 22 year old whilst keeping your financial house in order is a bloody good win for Liverpool, and it’s something Man Utd must follow.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-transfers-liverpool-nunez-fowler/bltfcebcc43ec2367e5,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
9141,Newcastle in talks with Saudi Pro League side over Miguel Almiron transfer,"As reported by talkSPORT’s Saudi correspondent Ben Jacobs, Newcastle United are in talks with Al Shabab over the potential transfer of Paraguayan player Miguel Almiron. While the deal isn't finalized yet, the agreement could be a significant blow to Newcastle fans, as Almiron has been a fan favourite since joining in 2019 from Atlanta United.Almiron's memorable moment came in October when he scored Newcastle's first Champions League goal in two decades during a spectacular 4-1 victory over Paris Saint-Germain at St. James' Park.However, recent times have been challenging for Eddie Howe's team, finishing fourth in their Champions League group and slipping to mid-table in the Premier League. Concerns about complying with financial fair play regulations have also arisen, given Newcastle's substantial net spend following the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund's takeover in October 2021.To address financial considerations, the potential sale of Almiron to Al Shabab, a club not owned by the PIF, could play a role.

8457,"Five hours training a day, internet & meeting David Beckham: Path to Pro","Ever wondered what it takes to become a pro gamer? Guild Academy Esports player Ben 'Brig' Brigdale gives an insight into the hours of daily practice needed, why fast internet is a must, and what it was like to meet David Beckham. Brig, 18, met Beckham as part of Guild Esports' partnership with Sky Broadband, with the former England captain gifting the youngster Sky Full Fibre broadband to aid in his quest to becoming a pro gamer. This all took place through Sky Broadband’s new 3 part series, Path to Pro, that is available to watch now on YouTube, following Ben, Ruby and Suleymon on their path to becoming pro gamers. Brig described weak internet as a ""nightmare"" for gamers, but unlike traditional broadband (also known as FTTC), Sky Full Fibre is powered by a fibre cable direct to your home, giving you a faster and more reliable broadband connection. ""Sometimes the internet was struggling a bit, for gaming you need stable internet,"" Brig said. ""Lagging in any game is an absolute nightmare. If you've not got the best speeds it's a struggle. I've messaged mates and gone round their house to play sometimes. ""Words can't really describe how grateful I am for [Full Fibre]."" The amount Brig and other esports gamers are practising requires that strength of connection. Incredibly, Brig revealed he is practicing EA Sports' FC 24, previously FIFA, for up to five hours a day. More about Guild Esports More about Sky Full Fibre ""I was putting in at least 4-5 hours minimum, and now it's 5-6 hours, constantly trying to find ways to get better. I knew I had to put in the time and effort to try and compete. Knowing the game, what works, what doesn't."" Brig's path to pro began with competitive match-ups against his brother and Dad, and he now hopes to take his skills to new levels with help from Guild Esports, and of course his new stronger internet. ""My brother's older than me and was always playing, and you get that competitiveness from that. To be honest, my Dad and brother used to beat me a lot, and it used to really annoy me! Which I think is why I've got competitive now. ""I always knew about the pro scene. I used to watch loads of tournaments but was never old enough to compete. I played a European tournament for the first time, and finished in the top 64 to 32. ""Everyone wants to win a trophy, come out with success, but to be honest for me I want to experience everything in esports. I want to enjoy what I'm doing, I don't want to be dreading playing, I want to go to tournaments and enjoy it."" But what mental skills are needed to get to Brig's level? He takes inspiration from his experience playing cricket. ""Competing online is a patience game. It tests your mentality. If you really want to win, you have to put your head down and stay composed, stay patient, and it's just a waiting game. ""I play a lot of cricket. Cricket is to some people a long and boring sport. But you have to be patient, you're out there for a long time, and be switched on and ready for the whole time. If you switch your game off for a second, you're out. You have to stay patient and not get frustrated. ""It's the same with gaming, if I play against someone who is very slow, and I play very quick, I have to adapt, but be patient until he makes the moves. The minute you lose concentration, you get punished for it at the top level of gaming."" Gaming has opened Brig up to a new community of personalities and friends, and admits his successes so far have increased his confidence in everyday life. ""I've made a lot of mates through it. You talk to people on these platforms, and through them you talk about other stuff too, in general, normal life. ""I'd say it has [increased my confidence]. When I go out with my family, and people know about what I do, they ask me quite a lot of questions about it. Before I maybe wouldn't talk about it. I now openly talk about it, and I get opportunities that people don't really get."" And what was it like to meet David Beckham? ""I've still not accepted the fact I met David Beckham and spoke to him! I've still got family members asking me about it! I pretty much had an hour-long conversation with him about my gaming experience, and he understood part of what I was talking about because he'd gone through an academy as a footballer. ""It was a surreal moment, I'm a massive football fan, so to actually speak to him was unbelievable. To even have the opportunity to speak to him, even for two minutes, to get an hour with him, it was unbelievable.""",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13023155/five-hours-training-a-day-internet-meeting-david-beckham-path-to-pro,Author not found,Publish time not found,skysports
4951,Liverpool starlet Jones risks becoming a victim of Klopp's 'strongest ever' squad,"These are unprecedented times for Liverpool, and for Jurgen Klopp. Never before has a Reds boss had a squad this strong. Never before has he had so many options to choose from, so many possibilities and permutations. And so many tough decisions to make. Liverpool’s ‘depth’ has been seen as their biggest weakness in recent years but, as we head into the business end of the campaign, it could prove to be the difference between failure and success. And for Klopp that will bring with it plenty of tough conversations. “I’m not sure if it’s the hardest part, but it’s the part I like the least,” he told GOAL last week when asked about the difficulty of leaving players out of not only his starting XI, but out of his squad entirely. “It’s easy when the boys give you a reason, like spending three nights in a bar or being pictured in a pub. Then [you can say] 'you are not here, you don't understand the situation', but we've never had that.  “None of these players have deserved it so far so it is not easy. It's very difficult, but it is still part of the business.” When Liverpool beat Burnley at Turf Moor recently, they did so without Joe Gomez, Divock Origi, Takumi Minamino or Curtis Jones – all of whom had been left behind on Merseyside. All of those four are Premier League winners and all have made significant contributions to the club, both this season and previously. All, naturally, wanted to play and were devastated to miss out. Gomez, Origi and Minamino, at least, were back on the bench for Liverpool’s next game, away to Inter in the Champions League, and all three featured in last weekend’s win over Norwich at Anfield. Jones, though, was missing for both those games, left out even in Milan when Klopp was able to name 12 substitutes.  He was at Anfield for the Norwich game but only as a spectator, sat huddled into his big coat behind the dugout while his teammates ground out a 3-1 win to keep the pressure on Manchester City at the top of the Premier League. He’s fit and available, training as normal and training well by all accounts. He will hope to return to the squad for Wednesday’s game with Leeds and will, like everyone else, be desperate to be involved in Sunday’s Carabao Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley. Were he to miss out, it would represent a significant blow, even to a player known for his self-confidence.  He was in the team a few weeks back, after all, starting five games in a row either side of the most recent international break, now he’s fighting just to get on the bench. It has already been something of a stop-start campaign for the young Scouser.  It started with concussion, suffered in the Reds’ last pre-season friendly against Osasuna, and was disrupted further by a freak eye injury picked up in training, which kept him out of action for two months from the end of October.  Still, there have been strong performances, as well as flashes of individual quality.  His strike at Brentford in September should have been a match-winner, and there was a trio of assists away at Porto in the Champions League.  More recently, there was a standout display at Arsenal in the second leg of the Carabao Cup semi final. But his last two appearances saw him substituted before the hour mark, and with the likes of Naby Keita, Thiago Alcantara, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, James Milner and Harvey Elliott all fit and jostling for places, it has been Jones who has paid the price.  The challenge now is how will he respond? “There might be a chance you start next week,” said Klopp recently. “That's how it is, so keep yourself in a good place.  “Be angry with me, be disappointed with the problem but next day show up and be the best version of yourself and make the decisions difficult, because if you drop in training it is not a good solution.  ""That would make it start going in the wrong direction.” There is certainly no suggestion that that is happening, but Klopp did reveal last month that he had had “a long talk” with Jones about his role in the side, and about the expectations the club has of him.  “I love the boy and I love the potential he has,” he said. “I am one of his biggest fans. “But we have to now really make the next steps and make sure that he fulfils the potential he has on the pitch. “He’s young – very young – but from what I see his ­potential is just incredible. So, we have to find a way to show that much more often. “That’s where we are in Curtis’ development.” Where we will be in a few weeks’ time, however, could tell us even more.  It’s been a tough few weeks for the 21-year-old. Now, he needs to show what he’s made of, and what he can bring to this Liverpool side.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-star-jones-faces-key-period-klopp-strongest-ever/blt290ec9a1bee300b3,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8092,Chelsea star shuts down rumours of possible move to Barcelona â âIâm coming out to deny themâ,"Last week, it was rumoured that Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez was keen on a move to Barcelona, to the point where he asked his agent to explore the possibility of a deal being done. It comes after a somewhat underwhelming 12 months at the Premier League club for Fernandez, who joined in the aftermath of winning the World Cup with Argentina in December 2022.  However, he has moved quickly to quash this speculation. Speaking after scoring for Chelsea in their 3-1 victory over Crystal Palace on Monday evening. Fernandez confirmed that the Barcelona rumours are fake, and that he only wants to remain in west London, as per MD. âI donât want to leave Chelsea. Iâve been very happy here with my teammates and the coaching staff since the first day I arrived. The people at the club treat me very well, Iâm grateful for that. Iâll stay here until they want me to leave. I donât know where those rumours came from; they had appeared on social media. Iâm coming out to totally deny them.â The fact of the matter is that even if Fernandez wanted to join Barcelona, a deal would have been next to impossible anyway, due to Chelseaâs likely demands and the Catalan sideâs ongoing financial woes.

2925,‘Agueroooo!’ - Remembering Man City star's goal vs QPR & Martin Tyler's iconic commentary,"The date of May 13, 2012 will forever be etched into Manchester City folklore, as that was the day when a Premier League title duck was broken in the most dramatic of fashions by one Sergio Aguero. The Blues headed into the final day of the 2011-12 campaign knowing that they had to match the result of arch-rivals Manchester United at Sunderland in order to get their hands on the English top-flight crown. Roberto Mancini’s side appeared set to fluff their lines when falling two goals down at home to QPR, while the Red Devils picked up a 1-0 victory at the Stadium of Light, but a remarkable finish to the season saw Pablo Zabaleta and Edin Dzeko offer City hope before, with 93 minutes and 20 seconds on the clock, Aguero stepped forward to become a legend. Various media outlets covered City’s final day showdown with QPR, but it is the words of Sky Sports commentator Martin Tyler that will be forever associated with the most stunning of goals. As time slipped away at the Etihad Stadium, he said: “It's finished at Sunderland, Manchester United have done all they can. “Manchester City are still alive here. Balotelli. Agueroooo! “I swear you'll never see anything like this ever again. So watch it, drink it in. “They've just heard the news at The Stadium of Light. Two goals in added time for Manchester City to snatch the title away from Manchester United.” Aguero had been kept relatively quiet by QPR before his decisive contribution late on, with City’s all-time leading goalscorer saying in 2020 of his most memorable strike: “I didn't do anything that game. I came on and scratched my balls for the whole game! I only received a kick in the back and did nothing else... until the goal. “I swear, guys, that I didn't want to kick the ball like I did... I didn't want to put it there. If I had it kicked like I really wanted, it would have hit the defenders in the way and it wouldn't have been a goal. But luckily I scored.” He would go on to tell City’s official website after seeing a statue unveiled in his honour: “Following the goal, I was so happy, but I was sort of in shock. I don't remember anything immediately after, but when it sank in, I realised I'd scored the best goal of my life. “Normally, when I was young, when I scored a goal, I always took my shirt off and waved it around my head. So, when I scored, it was just natural and I ran towards the corner before my team-mates jumped on me and they were all saying, 'I love you Sergio, I love you!'. “I had to tell them, 'leave me alone', because I was in shock at that moment, but the celebration was still good!” The City fans in attendance on a historic day for the club will never forget what they witnessed, but the same can be said for those that were left watching on from afar. Former Oasis star Noel Gallagher said of his experience: “We arrived in Santiago and a friend of ours opened his bar early so we could watch it. It started off tense, then it went from tense into elation and then back to tension. It seemed like QPR were in the lead for a lifetime and it was very dark. “Right before we scored, I thought ‘We need it now, if we’re going to do it, we need to do it now’. And then when Dzeko scored, I don’t know what happened after that, there was a lot of swearing. “My mate tried to pull the TV off the wall. I swore a lot and then I cried like a baby because I’ve never seen anything like that before. It was mind blowing.” He later added to talkSPORT: “It’s such a great finish, too, because he could have gone down in the area when one of their players went in for a sliding tackle, and he could have gone down, but he’s got nerves of steel, that lad, and it’s just the greatest moment in the club’s history. “And to finally stick it up United as well, with Ferguson as well, all the cards just fell, it was beautiful! “But, can you imagine now, when Aguero scored that goal, and they have to check it on VAR? Imagine, with that stadium going wild, if the referee put his finger to his ear? It would have killed it!” One famous Blues supporter who was in attendance, alongside Noel’s brother Liam Gallagher, was Ricky Hatton, with the world champion boxer telling Express Sport: “Me and Liam got invited to go to the Manchester town hall for the celebratory party with the players, staff and their wives. “We weren’t with our girlfriends so we decided to take each other! We had some beers and a chat with Mancini, Balotelli and Kompany, who has been a friend of mine for a good few years. “To win the league like we won it, to go out with Liam Gallagher, who has always been one of my heroes - it couldn’t have gone any better. “It was a very heavy night. I woke up and just when I thought I could have a lie in, Liam rang up saying ‘fancy going on the team bus with the trophy?’ and I thought ‘oh, here we go again.’ Obviously, I went!”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/agueroooo-man-city-goal-vs-qpr-martin-tyler-commentary/blt453a2d50a759b140,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3793,French football boss Labrune 'shocked' by 'unacceptable' Tebas remarks about Mbappe PSG deal,"The president of the French Professional League (LFP) has hit back at La Liga counterpart Javier Tebas following the latter's complaints about Kylian Mbappe's contract extension at Paris Saint-Germain. After more than a year of reports saying the French striker was set to join Real Madrid, he opted to snub the Spanish team's offer and continue his career in his homeland. The deal caused outrage in Spain, with Tebas declaring it an ""insult to football"" and La Liga releasing a statement promising to complain to UEFA and the European Union. LFP chief Vincent Labrune has hit back at Tebas in a letter written to the president of La Liga, saying his remarks were ""unacceptable"" and ""completely inappropriate"". ""We would like to express in the strongest terms our disapproval, but also our incomprehension, of your latest attacks against Ligue 1 and one of our clubs,"" he wrote. ""We are all the more shocked by these attacks as you are president. of the European Leagues (supposed to represent all leagues in Europe, including Ligue 1) and a member of the UEFA Executive Committee (whose role is to promote the collective interests of European football). ""Your attacks on Ligue 1 and one of our clubs, Paris Saint-Germain, and one of our players, Kylian Mbappe, are based on your own interpretation of financial unsustainability and competitive imbalance, which you repeatedly attribute to Ligue 1 and one of our clubs. ""Today your disrespectful remarks seem to be directed at Kylian Mbappe, who is widely recognised as one of the best players in the world and who simply did not join your league, by choice, despite a similar offer.  ""Unlike you, Ligue 1 salutes and promotes players in our league and across Europe - including those in your league. Someone in your various functions would be well advised to do the same."" Labrune highlighted Real Madrid's huge wage bill and the massive debt of Barcelona as bigger issues than PSG's renewal with Mbappe, adding: ""Two of your clubs have broken a multitude of records in the past decade. These two clubs have broken the world record [transfer fee] six times. ""In terms of player salaries, Real Madrid currently has two of the highest-paid players in world football sat on their bench. Barcelona is reported to have a debt level of €1.5 billion.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/labrune-shocked-unacceptable-tebas-remarks-mbappe-psg/blt8a5081a5343e7695,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1804,Verratti explains why Ligue 1 title-winning PSG feel ‘p*ssed off’ after every game,"Paris Saint-Germain have already wrapped up another domestic title in 2021-22, but Marco Verratti admits the Ligue 1 giants are ending every game “feeling p*ssed off” as they have nothing left to play for. Champions League glory has proved elusive once again following a dramatic last-16 defeat to Real Madrid, while Nice sent them packing on penalties at the same stage of the Coupe de France. Mauricio Pochettino’s side are now going through the motions with two matches left this season, and Italy international midfielder Verratti concedes it is difficult to shake a sense of what could have been in the French capital. PSG threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at home to Troyes, with Verratti telling Amazon Prime Video: “There is a bit of frustration. I think these are matches where you have to have fun, it's about winning and playing well as a team. “We are in one of the quietest moments of the season because there is no pressure. We just have to have fun. When you are free in your head, you can enjoy it even more. “I'm a little frustrated about that. We're coming to the end of the season and we always come out of games feeling p*ssed off. It's not the thing you dream of at the end of the season, especially when you are already champions.” He added: “I honestly think that we could do much better with the team we have. In difficult times, we could be better. When we are good as a team, we manage to take more pleasure from those matches. “It was a tough season. Even if we are champions, at the start of the season it was tough, we won a lot of matches late on. “That means we have great character, because we're still there two minutes from the end to score a goal, but I think we could be better as a team. “It's true that we changed the team a lot with several rookies. It is not an excuse, but it's the truth. It's difficult to create a big group when you change a lot. You have to take the good things of this season and try to build on it for next season.” Neymar's 100th goal for PSG was ruled out by VAR 😫 pic.twitter.com/bxp18rBvlr While claiming more major silverware, with the Ligue 1 crown wrestled back from Lille, PSG are desperate to savour European glory. Verratti admits the continental defeat to Real Madrid still stings, with Kylian Mbappe having netted home and away in the two-legged tie before the Blancos hit back with a Karim Benzema hat-trick to prevail 3-2 on aggregate. “We fought hard against Madrid and did 150 minutes very well,” Verratti said. “We won the championship, that's good and I think there's not much missing. Everyone has to give more more so at the end we can say: 'OK, we have no regrets, we gave everything, they were stronger'. “We do have this little regret. We had a dream in the Champions League. If you reach the semi-final then you can find yourself in the final having played two games well. Madrid hit us hard.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/verratti-ligue-1-title-psg-pssed-off/blt4666aa4dafcdb089,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6491,"Kounde had doubts about Chelsea and Barcelona submitted better offer, reveals Sevilla chief Monchi","Sevilla sporting director Monchi says Barcelona's offer for defender Jules Kounde was more attractive than Chelsea, which prompted the club to sell the player to their fellow Liga club. Barcelona beat Chelsea to the signing of Kounde, as the defender is set to seal his move to Camp Nou after completing a medical and officially signing a contract. Speaking about Sevilla's deal with Barcelona for Kounde, the Sevilla chief suggested that while they were in advanced talks with Chelsea over a possible transfer in the previous week, Kounde himself had reservations about joining the Blues. He told SFC TV: ""Last Thursday we reached a verbal agreement with Chelsea and the player. When everything was closed there were some doubts in Chelsea and the at the weekend everything stopped. We had a very good offer.  ""That's where Barcelona appeared and the first time Mateu Alemany contacts us is on Monday. They sent us a lower offer than what we wanted and then they made an effort to put a very good offer and reach an agreement, the most important part of the sale."" Monchi added: ""We needed to sell to generate capital gains and we had an important sword of Damocles because the player had two years left on his contract. It was a complicated situation."" Barcelona have been busy this window, signing Jules Kounde, Raphinha, Andres Christensen, Robert Lewandowski and Franck Kessie. They also agreed on a new contract with Ousmane Dembele, who many had expected to depart after his old deal expired at the end of last season.  Xavi may not be done strengthening his squad, as Chelsea's Cesar Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso are being targeted.

11367,France 4-1 Australia: Holders Confirmed as Contenders,"No Karim Benzema, no N’Golo Kanté, no Paul Pogba, no problem. Well, except for that whole going down a goal in the first 10 minutes. And losing another key player to injury. France have already trailed for longer in the 2022 World Cup than they did in all of their seven matches in their triumphant 2018 campaign, but as 22 November problems go, a questionable start in 4-1 win is comparatively minor. On a day that started with Argentina losing to Saudi Arabia, the world champions also had a bit of a scare when Craig Goodwin beat Hugo Lloris high in the ninth minute. Lucas Hernández was lost to injury on the goal, and his replacement and brother Theo almost cost France a second goal with a bad giveaway just before the midway point of the first half. Theo absolved himself minutes later with an assist to Adrien Rabiot, whose goal was his second in his last three matches for France after managing one in his first 27 appearances for his country. Five minutes later, Rabiot assisted Olivier Giroud with his 50th goal for France with more to come. Giroud, who didn’t score in 2018 and is here as Les Bleus’ No. 9 after Benzema was dropped due to injury, drew even with Thierry Henry for the French goalscoring record at 51 in the 71st minute. Giroud finished with five shots amounting to 1.67 xG – individually more than each of the other 15 teams to play at the tournament so far (Argentina finished with 1.47 non-penalty xG earlier today). In fact, Giroud’s efforts tonight saw him hit the sixth-highest single-match non-penalty xG record in World Cup recorded history (since 1966).  It was half of France’s 2.18 first-half xG, which rose to 4.18 after 90 minutes for France’s highest single-match xG mark on record at a World Cup. Dating to 1966, it’s the third-highest xG mark at the World Cup finals behind Belgium vs. Tunisia in 2018 and Germany vs. Algeria in 2014. For Australia, keeping such an early lead was always going to be difficult, but this is a theme a year in the making. Points dropped from winning positions were a problem for Australia in AFC qualification with four gifted to China and Oman late in the process to complicate the Socceroos’ path. It’s even more difficult with Kylian Mbappé and Ousmane Dembélé doing their thing on the wings for the French. From Mbappé, it was a match-high 12 passes played into the box, a match-high nine crosses and a tournament-high 19 touches in the opposition box (the World Cup record for any player in 20). Australia’s team combined for seven. Mbappé assisted Giroud’s second after scoring one for himself while causing his usual havoc up the left side. 49.2% of France’s first-half attack came up the left side (38.8% for the match), but that doesn’t mean Dembélé was quiet on the right. For him, it was a one-on-one game – and quality over quantity with it. He ended the match completing three of four take-ons. Those early take-ons afforded him some space later in the match, which led to his assist to Mbappé in the 68th minute when electing to go with a cross rather than at his defender. It was Mbappé’s fifth World Cup goal, making him the youngest French player to reach that mark at 23 years, 337 days old. With the 0-0 final between Denmark and Tunisia earlier in Group D, France’s chances of finishing first in the group rise to 73.8%. Australia’s chances of progressing fall to 7.4.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2022/11/france-australia-world-cup-2022-stats/,Kevin Chroust,23/11/2022 1:00,the-analyst
7639,Erik ten Hag steps up six-player Man Utd transfer plan but Tottenham pose problem,"Manchester United are set to face competition from Tottenham in the race to sign highly-rated Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite.  Branthwaite, 21, is being eyed by United chiefs to spearhead a youthful recruitment drive led by incoming part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. INEOS chairman Ratcliffe, who's on the verge of becoming a 25 per cent stakeholder in United, received official ratification from the Premier League on Tuesday and it's expected that he'll be given the green light by the FA either this week or not. Ratcliffe's Â£1.3billion agreement with the Glazers also hands him control of the Red Devils' football operations and the opportunity to instill his focus of signing homegrown players. Branthwaite is in the midst of a true breakthrough season at Goodison Park, having enjoyed a loan spell with PSV Eindhoven last term working under ex-United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy. But it's not just the Red Devils who are interested in signing the England hopeful, as the Daily Mail claim that Tottenham have stepped up their efforts to sign him. Arsenal, Chelsea and Spanish giants Real Madrid have also made enquiries, so United supporters will be pleased to know that Branthwaite is just one name on Ratcliffe's six-man shortlist. Three more up-and-coming young centre-backs have been mentioned during internal discussions such as Jean-Clair Todibo, who plays for INEOS-owned Nice. The 24-year-old Frenchman is part of the best defence in Ligue 1 this season, but it's not just Todibo who's impressing in France's first tier. 18-year-old Lille starlet Leny Yoro is another defensive option for the Red Devils, although they'll likely face competition from Paris Saint-Germain. Benfica's Antonio Silva, 20, is also someone who United are believed to be keeping tabs on. There's also a focus on signing a Premier League-proven attacker, with Wolves winger Pedro Neto on the list of potential targets alongside Crystal Palace's Michael Olise. It appears that Olise is a more concrete option for Ratcliffe and co, with a release clause - worth in the region of Â£60million - set to become active this summer. To do any major deals, however, the Red Devils will need to free-up cash and keep themselves away from any trouble relating to Financial Fair play. Two big names who could be off United's wage book by July are Raphael Varane and Anthony Martial, both of whom are out of contract at the end of this season. Manager Erik ten Hag insists that decisions haven't yet been made but, especially in Martial's case, it's looking increasingly unlikely that the Red Devils will extend either of the duo's stays.

9041,Rudiger recovers from injury – Real Madrid centre-back pair for Girona game revealed,"Antonio Rudiger has shaken off the injury he picked up while playing for Real Madrid in the game against Getafe last week, reports say. The German powerhouse will partner with Aurelien Tchouameni in the clash against Girona this weekend, reports Marca's Jose Felix. Rudiger's recovery comes as a massive boost for Real Madrid given the injury crisis the team have been enduring, particularly in defence. Madrid captain Nacho is unlikely to return to full fitness before the Girona game. However, some sources expect him to make the bench for that game provided he completes Real Madrid's Friday training. Real Madrid are expecting to have Eder Militao back for the Champions League round of 16 second-leg. His return would seriously lift morale in Madrid's defence.

10270,Fastest Goals in Premier League History,"Who’s responsible for the fastest goal in Premier League history? We run through the top 10 quickest strikes across the competition. In 2019, Shane Long broke a record that had stood for nearly 19 years – the fastest Premier League goal in history. Just 7.69 seconds into the Tuesday evening clash between Watford and Southampton at Vicarage Road, the then-Republic of Ireland international striker put Saints 1-0 up. From the kick-off, Long charged down Craig Cathcart’s hopeful ball forward, latching on to it and dinking over the on-rushing Ben Foster. Until recently, all goal times were rounded up to the nearest second, so there wasn’t a definitive list of the fastest goals in Premier League history. That changed in 2018. As the Premier League’s official data supplier, Opta used archive footage and video technology to measure the quickest strikes in the competition’s history to the nearest hundredth of a second. So here you have it; the definitive list of the 10 fastest goals in Premier League history. Shane Long’s goal against Watford came in a hot streak for the Southampton striker. It was the first time he had scored in successive Premier League starts since May 2016. In fact, Long also scored in his next start, making it the first time he scored in three consecutive Premier League starts, with those goals coming against Liverpool, Watford and Bournemouth. Nevertheless, he didn’t get anywhere near Jamie Vardy’s record of 11 consecutive games with a goal for Leicester City in November 2015. Phillip Billing’s opener for Bournemouth against Arsenal on in March 2023 was scored after just 9.11 seconds, making it the second-fastest goal scored in Premier League history. Mikel Arteta’s side, who were top of the Premier League at the time, were stunned further when Marcos Senesi doubled Bournemouth’s lead in the second half. But goals from Thomas Partey, Ben White and a 97th-minute winner from Reiss Nelson ensured Arsenal still took all three points. It was the first time Arsenal had come back from a two-goal deficit to win a Premier League game since doing so against Spurs in February 2012. A centre-back by trade, Tottenham legend and former captain Ledley King was never known as a goal scorer. King scored 10 goals in 268 Premier League appearances, with six of these goals coming via headers. The English defender’s strike after 9.82 seconds against Bradford City was his first-ever goal in the competition, coming in just his eighth top-flight appearance. Only two of his 10 Premier League goals were scored north of London: his first against Bradford in December 2000 and his last against Man Utd in April 2010. It’s no surprise that one of the 260 goals netted by the all-time leading Premier League scorer makes the list. Alan Shearer’s goal after 10.52 seconds against Man City is still the fastest ever for a home side and the quickest left-footed strike in the competition’s history. This goal was the England international’s first in the opening minute of a Premier League game, and his 218th in the competition. The Newcastle striker only failed to notch in the 39th minute and 47th minute across all Premier League matches. With 260 goals, Shearer is a full 47 clear of Harry Kane in the all-time scoring charts. Even though the Danish schemer’s strike isn’t the quickest in Premier League history, at 10.54 seconds it is still the fastest goal ever at the new Wembley despite İlkay Gündoğan’s best efforts in the 2023 FA Cup final. Tottenham have a long history of scoring goals in the opening minute. Only Chelsea and Everton (both 12) have scored more goals in the first 60 seconds of a Premier League match than Spurs (11). Mark Viduka’s strike after 11.90 seconds against Charlton is the fastest goal by any non-European in Premier League history. Interestingly, Leeds United have scored six goals in the opening minute of Premier League games but none of them have come at Elland Road. Viduka remains the Yorkshire club’s highest Premier League goal scorer (59). Dwight Yorke’s effort against Coventry City for Aston Villa is the fastest-headed goal scored in Premier League history, coming in at 12.16 seconds. Yorke is used to being in the Premier League record books – in November 2000, the Trinidad & Tobago striker became the first non-Englishman to score 100 goals in the competition.  Yorke also held the record for the fastest hat-trick from the start of a game (22 minutes vs Arsenal in February 2001) for over 14 years until Sadio Mane broke the record in May 2015 (16 minutes) for Liverpool by scoring three goals in just 2 minutes and 56 seconds, which has never been bettered. Yorke finished his Premier League journey with 123 goals in 375 appearances across a career that saw him win the title three times with Manchester United as well as the FA Cup and UEFA Champions League. Only two of Chris Sutton’s first 39 Premier League goals came in the first 10 minutes, while five of his next eight strikes came in this period, including his goal against Everton after 12.94 seconds. Everton are familiar to being 1-0 down in the opening minute of Premier League games; the Toffees have conceded 10 goals in the first minute of Premier League games, the most of any side in the competition’s history. Kevin Nolan’s goal after 13.48 seconds against Blackburn Rovers was one of five Bolton have scored in the opening minute of a Premier League game, while three of those strikes were assisted by Kevin Davies. This effort was one of two Nolan scored in the first minute, also scoring after 51 seconds for West Ham against Fulham in September 2012. Only 12 other players have scored two or more in the opening minute of Premier League games in the competition’s history. James Beattie’s goal after 13.52 seconds against Chelsea is Southampton’s second entry in the top 10, while Jay Rodriguez was very close to making it three in the top 10. He scored at 13.68 seconds against Chelsea in 2013, which is the 12th-fastest goal in Premier League history. Beattie went from ecstasy to agony in this contest, scoring an own goal 33 minutes later – one of 56 instances of a player scoring a goal and an own goal in the same Premier League match. Asmir Begovic became the fifth goalkeeper to score a Premier League goal after this freak effort, which saw Begovic’s long clearance downfield deceive Southampton’s Artur Boruc. Not only is it the 11th-fastest goal in Premier League history but it is the furthest goal scored since 2003-04 when Opta started recording such data (95.66 yards). Begovic’s goal against Southampton dethroned Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard’s 92.2-yard effort against Bolton Wanderers in 2012, which had previously held the record for the furthest goal scored in Premier League history. 12th fastest: Jay Rodriguez – Southampton vs Chelsea (13.68 seconds) on 1 December 201313th fastest: Jesús Navas – Manchester City vs Tottenham (13.76 seconds) on 24 November 201314th fastest: Naby Keita – Liverpool vs Huddersfield Town (15.20 seconds) on 26 April 201915th fastest: Jay Rodriguez – Burnley vs Sheffield United (15.80 seconds) on 2 December 2023 Enjoy this?

1783,"Real Madrid vs Club America: Live stream, TV channel, kick-off time & how to watch","Real Madrid will not be reading too much into a Clasico friendly defeat to arch-rivals Barcelona, but they will be eager to start building pre-season momentum when facing Club America in the Soccer Champions Tour. The Blancos are set to line up against Mexican opposition at Oracle Park in San Francisco, California. Carlo Ancelotti’s side claimed La Liga and Champions League crowns last season, with GOAL on hand to bring you all of the information you need to catch a glimpse of how their preparations for the defence of those titles are going in the United States. Game Real Madrid vs Club America Date July 26/27, 2022 Kick-off 3:30 am BST / 10:30pm ET The pre-season contest will be broadcast in the United Kingdom on Premier Sports 1 and available to stream live through Premier Player. TV channel Online stream Premier Sports 1 Premier Player Ancelotti has confirmed that talismanic captain Karim Benzema, who hit 44 goals for the Blancos last season, will be involved after sitting out the meeting with Barca with a knock. Dani Carvajal remains stuck on the sidelines, though, after picking up an ankle problem in training ahead of a Clasico clash in Las Vegas. Real are expected to shuffle their pack against Mexican foes, with the likes of Luka Modric, Casemiro, Toni Kroos and Ferland Mendy pushing for starting berths. Position Players Goalkeepers Thibaut Courtois, Andriy Lunin, Luis Lopez, Lucas Canizares Defenders Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, David Alaba, Jesus Vallejo, Nacho Fernandez, Antonio Rudiger, Ferland Mendy, Alvaro Odriozola, Vinicius Tobias. Midfielders Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, Casemiro, Fede Valverde, Lucas Vazquez, Aurelien Tchouameni, Dani Ceballos, Eduardo Camavinga. Forwards Eden Hazard, Karim Benzema, Marco Asensio, Vinicius Jr., Rodrygo, Mariano Dias, Juanmi Latasa. Club America may be in the middle of their domestic season, but they have been fielding strong sides against European opposition.

4082,Bafana Bafana coach Broos justifies Orlando Pirates’ Monare selection ahead of Jali and Zwane,"Bafana Bafana coach Hugo Broos was again pressed by the media for his continued snubbing of Mamelodi Sundowns players Andile Jali and Themba Zwane. South Africa are preparing to play international friendly matches against Guinea on Friday next week, before meeting world champions France four days later in Lille. The Belgian said he preferred Sundowns, Orlando Pirates and AmaZulu players for their experience from playing continental football as he justified the inclusion of Thabang Monare in his squad. At 32, Monare is the oldest player in the Bafana squad and is the same age as Zwane, while Jali is 31. “For once and for all, I’m very sorry… Since I’m here everybody is always talking about Jali and Zwane,” Broos told the media as per iDiski Times. “I don’t have a comment on that. You know why they are not here, so I don’t have a comment on that, I will not repeat that every time.  I’m very sorry but for me no comment anymore about Jali and about Zwane. “You always have to try to increase the quality and to improve your team. We started in September. I said from the beginning I’ll try to build a young team but the door is not shut for the older ones.   “Look here on my left side [pointing at Thabang Monare], he’s the oldest player, he’s 32. So I never said the door is shut for those players.  But when I came here I saw that the team was old and when you have an old team you don’t have a future.  When we made the evaluation of the World Cup qualifiers, we saw that we missed something, we missed experience. “I saw the performances of Sundowns, AmaZulu and Pirates in Confederation Cup and Champions League and when players perform at that level, I don’t think that you can keep them out of your team – they deserve to be there, they have the quality, they have the experience.” Jali and Zwane are some of the experienced players in the Sundowns squad and have been top performers this season. But Broos insists a younger squad is what he needs and hopes he will have a stronger squad. “I hope that those guys will improve the quality and we’ll have a better team than two months ago,” Broos said. “This process will go on but the goal of all this is to have 25 players and that 25 players will always be there. I hope that for the qualifiers for Afcon, I’ll have my team.  “After seven to eight months, doing scouting every week in the PSL and looking for players abroad, I hope now we’ll have a group of players who’ll start the qualifiers in June.” The upcoming friendlies would be the first time Bafana returns to action since their 2022 Fifa World Cup hopes were upset by Ghana in November 2021.

11684,What Happens Next – Predicting The Premier League Run-In,"Matchweek 30 in the Premier League has been impacted by the ancient magic of the FA Cup, with the grand old competition’s sixth round meaning that only eight top-flight sides are in league action this weekend. The famous Analyst supercomputer is blinking away in the background, ready to get stuck into Wolves against Leeds, Aston Villa vs. Arsenal, Leicester vs. Brentford and the tasty looking encounter between Tottenham and West Ham, but it’s simply not enough for thinkers like me or you to go on, so instead let’s mix it up a bit and turn to the supercomputer’s hated rival, SuperComputer II, the machine that houses our seasonal predictions, and see what it makes of the remainder of the 2021-22 season as we begin the much-anticipated “run-in”. If you want to know the sort of science that has been programmed into SuperComputer II then it’s at the bottom of this article, but in the meantime let’s get stuck into the findings. Your team’s destiny is at stake. Remember in the autumn when everyone was confidently explaining the existence of a three-horse title race? Well, statistically that is still the case, just about, as the algorithm gives Chelsea a 0.6% chance of overhauling Manchester City and Liverpool, but let’s be honest, that simply isn’t going to happen. More pressing is whether City will win the league for the fourth time in five seasons or Liverpool for the second time in three. SuperComputer II makes City the favourites at 63.5%, and their remaining games were deemed easier than Liverpool’s by Paul Merson on Monday Night Football too. All eyes are on April 10 to see if Liverpool can win away at the Etihad in the league for the first time since 2015. If they do, expect these percentages to pivot considerably. In the meantime, just enjoy the fact we actually have a title race to enjoy. It doesn’t always happen. SuperComputer II’s model is certain that Chelsea will finish in the top four but the final spot is very much up for grabs. Arsenal are the favourites, on 57.7%, but have a tricky trip to Aston Villa this weekend and defeat there, after losing to Liverpool in midweek, would open this nervous race back up, especially if any of the three teams beneath them can find some sort of consistency. Manchester United — who defeated Spurs last weekend — are on 22.0%, while Tottenham themselves are on 17.9%. West Ham (2.3%) and Wolves (0.2%) are the outsiders but West Ham play Spurs on Sunday and, fresh from Europa League joy, could reinsert themselves as contenders with a win there. Add in the fact that Arsenal still have to play Spurs and also have a three game run of Chelsea A, Man Utd H and West Ham A starting in late April and you can see that this particular storyline still has a lot left in it. It’s the sort of race that has been decided by unhygienic lasagnes before, what will 2021-22 throw up (so to speak)? If it’s always a variety of ‘races’ in the top half of the table then it’s never anything but a battle at the bottom, and 2021-22 is a classic of the genre. Currently, the highest sides with a greater than <0.1% chance of going down are Southampton in 10th and Crystal Palace in 11th. But it’s a minuscule amount of danger and both clubs can concentrate this weekend on trying to reach the FA Cup semi-finals without worrying in the slightest about the Premier League. Leicester are even safer, according to SuperComputer II, and given they have more games remaining than any other side in the division and are getting some key players back from injury, you have to agree. Brighton are in terrible form but the model rates them as safer than Saints and Palace, while Newcastle and Brentford can officially say they are on the periphery of the relegation battle now and start approving avant-garde away kit designs for next season. Fulham ⬇️ Norwich ⬆️Fulham ⬆️ Norwich ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/on9nI9Ejn4 That leaves the bottom five as the section of the Premier League in real trouble. Norwich City, I’m afraid, are all but down, and will make their annual timeshare switch with Fulham. Watford and Burnley are heavily likely to be joining Norwich in the second tier in 2022-23 but Sean Dyche’s side still have 11 games left so a run of form could bring Leeds or Everton back into it. Everton’s win against Newcastle last night was huge, metaphorcally bolt-cutting the gloom-anchor that was dragging them towards the bottom three. That said, a good run of form or a bad run of form from any of the bottom five teams could change the situation considerably. Everton’s home game with Burnley in early April looks gigantic, as does Leeds’ game at Watford on April 9. The Hornets still have to visit each of the Premier League’s top three, which partly explains why the model favours Burnley. Roy Hodgson has been in this sort of position before, though. At this stage of the season — squeaky bum time — sometimes it’s know-how and a sense of calm that is more important than the fixtures you have left to play.

921,"Leeds players were 'over-trained' under Bielsa & 'stress levels were incredibly high', claims Marsch","Jesse Marsch believes Leeds United's injury woes this season came down to predecessor Marcelo Bielsa's methods, with the American noting the ""stress"" left in the Argentine's wake. The former RB Leipzig boss succeeded Bielsa at Elland Road following the latter's dismissal, with the club missing key faces through a slew of fitness problems and facing a fearsome relegation battle. Marsch has since steadied the ship, and helped to breathe new energy into the Whites, but now he admits that his task has been a difficult one given the atmopshere he inherited. ""I could see from just watching games from afar, and talking to people within the club, that the stress levels were incredibly high,"" Marsch told talkSPORT. ""You could see it in their faces. You could see in the 15th minute that some of them were already at the max – and that shouldn’t be the case. ""The injury issue, for me, had a lot to do with the training methodology. These players were over-trained and it led to them being physically, mentally, emotionally and psychologically in a difficult place to recover from week to week, game to game.  ""I have a very specific methodology with the way I work and I’ve had a reputation for high running data, but also having healthy, fit, strong players who can meet the standards of the game we want."" While fortunes look to have turned a corner, the American has admitted that it has been a tough task reshaping a Leeds team defined by Bielsa's characteristic style, which he paid tribute to while acknowledging the struggles faced to replace it. ""Marcelo had such a strong man-v-man playing style,"" he added. ""Trying to rip the players away from three-and-a-half years of being instructed to do exactly that, transitioning into what we’re trying to do, has been massively challenging for the players to adapt to.  “They’ve worked really hard at it, but they still fall into bad habits, especially when they’re fatigued on the pitch. It’s normal.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/leeds-players-over-trained-under-bielsa-stress-levels-incredibly-/blt37a1d06a981c8871,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

7804,Ronaldo used to argue with Mourinho about being subbed off - even when it's 5-0,"Jose Mourinho has revealed he used to argue with Cristiano Ronaldo when he wanted to substitute the star off at Real Madrid - but he was so talented he didn't need coaching.  Mourinho led the Bernabeu club between 2010 and 2013, with Ronaldo a major weapon as they took on Pep Guardiola's Barcelona. The Portuguese coach has told Rio Ferdinand's FIVE show it was impossible to tell Ronaldo to relax as he was so driven to accomplish more. 'You have guys like Cristiano, where you are playing against Levante and you are winning five-nil and you tell the guy to relax and take a rest,'  Mourinho said. 'No, no, no, I can score one more goal!' When you have guys like this, you know the boat is in the water and you just let the boat go and in the end you enjoy the fight.'  Mourinho was talking about the intense rivalry between his Real side and Guardiola's stylish Barcelona team which boasted Lionel Messi, Xavi and Andres Iniesta. In his first season, Real beat Barcelona 1-0 in the Copa del Rey final thanks to Ronaldo's towering header in extra time, before they pipped their rivals to the LaLiga title the following year. 'For us to win the league, we did 100 points. You knew that if you didn't do 98, 99, 100, you don't win it,' Mourinho added. 'You are then in trouble because Barcelona wins and the next season, the previous season, when Barcelona wins. I think we lost with 92 points or 91 points, something like that. 'So you know that if you made a mistake, you are in trouble.' Asked about what it was like to work with Ronaldo each day on the training ground, Mourinho said the player's natural abilities made him a dream to work with. 'I think you don't coach [him]. You don't teach much, it's about being happy and it's about creating an environment from the tactical point of view, from the ideas of football, where the player can show,' he said.   'Madrid for him was a little bit of a transition because for you he was a winger - left winger, right winger, dribbling, attacking people, beating people. 'In Madrid, he became more the goalscorer that he was for the rest of his career. 'In fact, probably the first time he played a big match as a striker was Real Madrid vs Barcelona in a cup final where he scored an amazing goal with an amazing header in extra time. 'Probably that was the first time people got the feeling that animal could be a goalscorer and not just a pure winger. 'Madrid was a bit of a hybrid because he was playing from the left but he was not wide and not chasing full-backs and we were protecting him with the balance being with Xabi Alonso and Sami Khedira.  'That is the position when they can be more effective and score more goals. 'Cristiano, you know him as well as I do and almost in consecutive years. Motivation, you don't need to give him. Ambition, you don't need to give him. Technique, you don't need to give him. 'You give some tactical adjustments and let the guy be happy.'",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Ronaldo-used-to-argue-with-Mourinho-about-being-subbed-off---even-when-its-5-0/3302222,,1 day ago,all-football-app
11253,England vs. France: World Cup 2022 Prediction and Match Preview,"After prevailing against Senegal and Poland, England and France face off in the final quarter-final at Qatar 2022. We preview the game ahead of kick-off at the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor, with added insight from our supercomputer model. Neither England nor France see a clear favourite as they prepare to face one another in a highly anticipated World Cup quarter-final. The Three Lions and Les Bleus each eased through the group stage and the last 16, beating Senegal and Poland respectively in the last round to set up a far trickier tie in the next round. Although England have won both of the sides’ previous World Cup meetings, France have lost just one of the past eight between the nations in all competitions. England have impressed in attack across three of their World Cup games in Qatar so far, with 12 goals across those three matches versus Iran, Wales and Senegal, including strikes by Jordan Henderson, Bukayo Saka and Harry Kane in the 3-0 last 16 win over the African champions. But it’s not just been attack that they have impressed, with three successive clean sheets thanks much to the performances of Jordan Pickford in goal and Harry Maguire and John Stones in central defence. You must allow functional cookies to continue. France head into the quarter-finals as the team with the second-most shots (75) and third-highest expected goals total (8.8), but have golden boot hopeful Kylian Mbappe looking to add to his overall tally of nine FIFA World Cup goals – the same as Lionel Messi and one more than Cristiano Ronaldo, despite the PSG striker still being just 23 years old. With service being provided by the more than capable Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembélé, he’ll undoubtedly be a player that the English are worried about. Didier Deschamps’ side are the world champions – albeit the first holders to feature in a quarter-final since Brazil in 2006. Meanwhile, Gareth Southgate is hoping to become the first England manager to go to two World Cup semi-finals, and Kyle Walker – on whom there is plenty of focus ahead of the battle with French star Mbappe – cannot split the two teams. “We’re playing the world champions, but we are two good teams that will go toe to toe,” the England right-back said. “You’ve seen what can happen in 90-plus minutes. “There have been shocks and for us this is just another game. We take our hat off to them as world champions, but each and every one of us will not be rolling that red carpet out for them to treat it as a theatre. “We have great talent – talk about the goals we have scored and the clean sheets that we’ve kept. In my eyes, neither team is the underdogs or the favourites.” It is an assessment France midfielder Adrien Rabiot agrees with, even if England have been eliminated from six of their past eight World Cup knockout matches against fellow European nations. “They are a team that has the same characteristics as us, very fast on the wings, with attacking full-backs, midfielders who can get forward, and [Declan] Rice looks a bit like [Aurelien] Tchouameni,” Rabiot said. “I am not sure that we should say that we have to be careful. They will also be very careful because we have the possibility of putting them in difficulty. “It’s an open game with two teams who know how to counter. What can make a difference is set pieces. They are very good, we will have to be vigilant and not make the same mistakes as against Denmark. They have weapons, but we are not inferior.” Teenage sensation Bellingham will play a huge role in getting England up the pitch. He has won possession more often than any team-mate (23), with only Harry Kane (six) doing so more often in the final third (five). He’s been a key part of England winning the most high turnovers at the tournament (38). Mbappe has the talent to decide the game not just by scoring but also by setting up Giroud, as he did against Poland. Mbappe (five) alone has scored more goals for France at this World Cup than the 36-year-old (three). The only older player to net four at a single World Cup was 38-year-old Roger Milla for Cameroon in 1990. England players will know Giroud well from his nine seasons as a Premier League goalscorer at Chelsea and Arsenal. Neither Walker nor Rabiot may be able to choose a favourite, but Opta’s supercomputer can – just. France are given a 40.3% chance of winning, ahead of slight underdogs England’s 32.4%. In a tie this tight, extra time or penalties could be required, with the draw rated at 27.3%. Of course, there are three other ties to be played in this knockout round of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

580,Revealed: What will Christian Eriksen's Man Utd squad number be?,"Christian Eriksen is a Manchester United player, having linked up with the Red Devils on July 15, and will be eager to make an immediate impression at Old Trafford. After many years of being linked with the Premier League giants, the Denmark international is finally on their books, joining as a free agent after spending the second half of last season at Brentford. He returned to competitive action with the Bees after recovering from a cardiac arrest suffered at Euro 2020, with his exploits in west London convincing United to make a move. At 30 years of age, and with useful experience of life in England under his belt from spells at Tottenham and Brentford, Eriksen is expected to star for Erik Ten Hag’s new-look side, but what number will he have on his back? GOAL takes a look… The Denmark international is an archetypal No.10, with his creative qualities allowing him to slip seamlessly into that role. United already have somebody filling that spot, though, in the form of Marcus Rashford, so an alternative jersey had to be taken on. The Red Devils revealed that Eriksen will wear the No. 14 shirt as he slots into Ten Hag’s squad. His integration into new surroundings were delayed slightly by a pre-season tour of Asia and Australia but United have now returned to Europe, ahead of friendly dates against Atletico Madrid in Oslo and Rayo Vallecano at Old Trafford, meaning that Eriksen can start to see game time. Christian Eriksen has verbally agreed a three-year deal with Manchester United 🗣 pic.twitter.com/qXvWdJQSTv A couple of the numbers that Eriksen has taken on at club level in the recent past were up for grabs in Manchester. He was most recently No.21 at Brentford, with an opportunity presenting itself to continue that theme, while 24 – the spot he filled at Serie A giants Inter – is also available. He's a 🔟 but he wears 1️⃣4️⃣ 😎🇩🇰 @ChrisEriksen8#MUFC Looking further down the list at Old Trafford, and No.6 could have been inherited from the departed Paul Pogba, but instead went to Lisandro Martinez In the end, Eriksen opted to take on the No.14 jersey at United, which was vacant after Jesse Lingard departed on a free when his contract expired.  Team Shirt number Odense 10 Ajax 51 Ajax 8 Tottenham 23 Inter 24 Brentford 21 Man Utd 14 Eriksen started out at 10 for Odense and has tended to fill that jersey when turning out for his country. He was, however, 51 when making a senior breakthrough at Ajax before becoming their established No.8 across four seasons. The Dane favoured 23 at Tottenham – with that number taken by Luke Shaw at United – and has remained in the 20s during more recent times.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-christian-eriksen-man-utd-squad-number/blt1b1ee137bb2b6e35,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8406,Hull City 0-1 Swansea City: Liam Cullen earns Swans first win since New Year's Day,"Hull's Sky Bet Championship play-off hopes suffered a blow with a disappointing 1-0 defeat against Swansea at the MKM Stadium. The Tigers had gone into the game in the top six, but it was the visitors who eased their relegation fears by claiming all three points. Swansea went ahead after 10 minutes as Liam Cullen got on the end of a corner from the left to steer a low shot into the bottom-left corner and the home side struggled to create clear scoring chances in response. Josh Tymon created the first opening for the visitors after seven minutes but his driven cross from the left was too quick for any of his team-mates to connect with in the Hull box. With 10 minutes gone, Swansea forced the first corner which Tymon swung in low from the left and Cullen ran in unmarked to steer a left-foot shot inside the near post. Hull tried to respond, and Anass Zaroury swung in a cross from the left but it was too far in front of Regan Slater's run to threaten the Swansea goal. The Swans should have had a second after 22 minutes when the ball came in from the right, but Przemyslaw Placheta headed back across the area when he should have aimed for an open goal. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp Hull were getting punished for mistakes and only a tackle in his own area by Slater halted another attack before Ronald fired over following a free-kick. Ozan Turfan headed straight at Carl Rushworth when the ball dropped to him in the area with Hull's best chance on the half-hour. A surging run by Jaden Philogene was halted by Ben Cabango's foul but the fact the Tigers wasted the free-kick was indicative of a lacklustre first-half display and they trailed at the break. A raking pass down the middle from Alfie Jones found Turfan just offside as he ran towards the Swansea goal in the opening minutes of the second half. Billy Sharp replaced Lewie Coyle after 54 minutes and nearly made an instant impact as he reached Turfan's through ball before Rushworth, but Nathan Wood got back to clear his prodded shot just short of goal. Cullen nearly had his second when Hull failed to clear a cross but steered his shot just wide of a post. Tymon fired in a cross from the left which Ryan Allsop beat away at his near post for a corner, but Swansea could not repeat their first-half goal as Jamie Paterson fired his volley off target. Philogene forced Rushworth to save with his knees at the near post as the home side looked for a late equaliser. Allsop beat away a rising shot from Tymon and then gathered the loose ball as Swansea pushed for a second goal, but they had already done enough to claim the points. Hull's Liam Rosenior: ""We didn't deserve anything today. One of the few times I can say that since I've been here. ""When you do that, you give the opposition momentum. Credit to Swansea, we gave them a leg up and they won the game. ""If we mark the player properly we don't get blocked. That's the things we work on in training. ""One, our performance wasn't good enough by our standards, and two, we've cost ourselves a point. ""We gave the ball away cheaply and when you do that you give the opposition energy, you give them oxygen. ""I told (the players) what we have to improve on. We have to bounce back from the setbacks. We need to learn on the job."" Swansea's Luke Williams: ""I think the players deserved that, a fantastic performance and even more fantastic result. ""There are quite a few things, the openings that we made were very deliberate. ""I loved the work-of-art set-piece, and the players delivered on that and scored. ""When you watch Alan go to work on a set-piece and then see the players deliver on that it's a privilege. ""We scored a goal away from home against a very good team and the back-line led us well, they kept us aggressive. ""Liam has come in said 'I need to do the same level of work that Jerry has done and take my chance'. ""We have lovely competition between these two players, it's good to develop this kind of rivalry within the team. ""I really felt a strong positive energy in the changing room going into this game and we played like we believed."" Correctly predict six scorelines to win £250,000 for free with Super 6.

8517,Emiliano Sala: Cardiff City and football agent Willie McKay reach agreement five years after plane disaster,"Cardiff City and football agent Willie McKay have reached an out-of-court agreement over his involvement in the 2019 Emiliano Sala transfer, on the eve of the first day of their hearing. Sky Sports News previously reported McKay was being sued by Cardiff in order to obtain information about his involvement in the Sala deal. Sala was due to complete a club-record fee to Cardiff from Nantes during the January transfer window but died after his private plane crashed over the English Channel. Sky Sports News has previously reported McKay and his son arranged the private plane for Sala. In June 2023, Cardiff launched legal proceedings against Nantes in France, where they are seeking damages for the transfer and as part of the proceedings in France, the club were attempting to sue McKay to understand his involvement in the transfer. According to a source close to the case, Cardiff also argue they would have avoided relegation if Sala had played for the club and are seeking damages for losses in revenue from the relegation. As part of the proceedings in France, Nantes claim McKay had no involvement in the transfer, which Cardiff dispute. A hearing was due to take place on February 8, but Sky Sports News has been told this hearing was canceled after the parties reached an out-of-court agreement. The terms of the agreement are confidential. Sky Sports News attended a preliminary hearing last week, where McKay failed to have the proceedings delayed. A statement from Willie McKay said: ""Out of respect for the family of Emiliano Sala, I felt it was necessary to confirm that Cardiff City FC have reached an agreement with me regarding their claim against Nantes FC. ""I have, throughout this process, provided evidence to assist the Dorset Coroner, Dorset Police, Civil Aviation Authority and the Air Accidents Investigation Board and, always acted openly and honestly during all the investigations into the tragic death of Emiliano. ""My family and myself, have endured endless unfounded allegations and accusations, but we have always known that we were innocent of any wrongdoing. Throughout all the above investigations, we have been found to be innocent of any wrongdoing of any kind leading up to the awful events on the 21 January 2019."" Capital Law, lawyers for Cardiff City, told Sky Sports News: ""The club is pleased with the outcome and remains committed to recovering the losses it has suffered as a result of FCN's negligence.""",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11688/13066149/emiliano-sala-cardiff-city-and-football-agent-willie-mckay-reach-agreement-five-years-after-plane-disaster,Author not found,Publish time not found,skysports
4708,How many stadiums have Qatar unveiled for the 2022 World Cup? ,"With the 2022 World Cup less than a year away, the hosts Qatar have already unveiled seven of the eight planned venues for the global showpiece tournament. While Stadium 974 was officially unveiled a few weeks back, Al Bayt stadium became the latest venue to be inaugurated on Tuesday during the opening day of the FIFA Arab Cup. Al Bayt, a 60,000-seater venue designed to resemble the tents historically used by nomadic people in the Gulf region, hosted Qatar’s 1-0 victory against Bahrain. The stadium will also host the opening match of Qatar 2022 in just under a year. The inauguration of Al Bayt was attended by the Amir of Qatar, His Highness Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, who officially announced the start of the tournament. Let us have a look at the other stadiums which have already been launched. One of the most iconic stadiums in the country, Khalifa International Stadium was opened in 1976 in Doha, Qatar and was renovated in 2017 for the 2022 World Cup. The Khalifa International Stadium has a capacity of 45,416 and it has hosted several top international events and matches like the Asian Games, the Gulf Cup and the AFC Asian Cup. Date Launched: May 19, 2017 Al-Janoub Stadium, located in Al-Wakrah, Qatar was officially launched before the Amir Cup 2019 final where Al Duhail won the title beating Al Sadd 4-1. The 40,000-seater stadium is designed by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. The architecture is inspired by the sails of traditional Dhow boats, used by pearl divers from the region. The curvilinear roof and exterior refer to Al Wakrah's history of seafaring, additionally giving spectators the feeling of being on a ship. Bowed beams hold up the roof, resembling a ship's hull. Date Launched: May 16, 2019 Located in Qatar Foundation's Education City in Al Rayyan, Qatar, the 40,000-seater Education City Stadium was opened with a digital ceremony. With 20 per cent of its building materials being green, the stadium is among the world's most environmentally sustainable stadiums. In May 2019, it even received a five-star GSAS (Global Sustainability Assessment System) rating. Date Launched: June 15, 2020 The 40,000 capacity stadium is located in Qatar's Al Rayyan city and is the home ground of Qatar Stars League giants Al Rayyan SC. The stadium was built in 2003 but went for renovation for the 2022 World Cup in 2016. After renovation, it was launched on Qatar's National Day after the 2020 Amir Cup final. Date Launched: December 18, 2020. The Al Thumama stadium was launched after the 2021 Amir Cup final which was won by Al Sadd who defeated Al Rayyan on penalties.  Designed by Qatari architect Ibrahim M Jaidah, the Al Thumama stadium resembles the 'gahfiya' - the traditional headcap worn by men and boys in the arab world.  The stadium will host matches up to the quarter-final stage at the 2022 World Cup Date Launched: October 22, 2021 The Stadium 974 was officially unveiled with a special event on November 20, 2021. The modular stadium, built from shipping containers, held its first match on November 30, 2021 on the opening day of the FIFA Arab Cup. The first-ever fully demountable stadium in World Cup history, Stadium 974 is naturally ventilated and will not need the Advanced Cooling Tech. It will also be dismantled after the World Cup. The 40000 capacity stadium is scheduled to host to around seven matches during the World Cup, up to the Round of 16 stage. Date Launched: November 20, 2021 The magnificent Al Bayt Stadium was launched when Qatar faced Bahrain in their opening fixture of the refurbished Arab Cup. The 60000-seater stadium is one of the largest venues for the Arab Cup and will host the tournament for 2022 World Cup next year on November 21. It will host a total of nine World Cup matches next year which makes it one of the more important stadiums in Qatar.Date Launched: November 30, 2021 The Influencer Cup is a tournament for content creators from different parts of the world that will take place in Doha, Qatar, on March 28 and 29. The event, which is organized by the Qatar Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, will be contested at the 974 Stadium, one of the eight venues that will be used at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The tournament will gather four teams, with more than 25 influencers involved in the action. Content Creators will represent their continents (Europa, Americas, MENA and Asia) in a 5x5 competition spread in two phases: a Round Robin group stage on the first day and Final and Third Place on the second. In both days, games will start at 2pm local time and can be followed on Roadto2022 and GOAL social channels. The event will also gather Qatar Legacy Ambassadors and other FIFA legends like Cafu, Samuel Eto'o, Tim Cahill, Javier Mascherano, Lothar Matthaus and Marcel Desailly, who will be involved in the activities across both days. Sponsored by Qatar Airways, the Influencer Cup is a rare opportunity to see football content creators from several places to engage with their counterparts using football to connect. Between the participants, high-profile influencers like Billy Wingrove, Sean Garnier, Werevertumorro and Morena Beltran are among the players.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/2022-world-cup-how-many-stadiums-launched-qatar/blt6247a17c682ca99a,Soham Mukherjee,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5474,USMNT midfielder Mihailovic completes transfer to AZ Alkmaar,"WHAT HAPPENED? The midfielder will join the Dutch side in January, as he becomes the latest American star to make the leap to Europe. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Mihailovic will finish the rest of the season in Montreal, with the club currently siting second in the Eastern Conference as he also pursues a World Cup roster spot with the USMNT. IN THREE PHOTOS: Mihailovic was signed as a homegrown player by the Chicago Fire in 2017 and went on to score seven goals in 76 appearances for the club. He was traded to Montreal in 2021 in exchange for $800k in General Allocation Money spread across two years, going on to feature 54 times while earning recognition as team MVP in 2021 after providing a club-record 16 assists. The 23-year-old midfielder has earned six caps for the USMNT, scoring his first senior goal against Panama in 2019 before being a member of that year's Gold Cup roster. WHAT THEY SAID: “This is a very exciting moment for me, but also sad, knowing that I will be leaving CF Montreal,” said Mihailovic. “When I joined this team from Chicago, I didn't expect this kind of reception... Europe has always been my dream and they gave me the chance to pursue this new path in my career. But it's not over yet! This season we have the opportunity to do something special for the Club and the city.” THE VERDICT: Even if the move doesn't quite help the midfielder's case for the 2022 World Cup, it does allow him to take a well-deserved next step in his career with a move to the Eredivisie, a league that seems to fit his style. Mihailovic is in the mix to be included this fall, and he has been unlucky not to feature for the U.S. this year due to injury issues. WHAT NEXT? Mihailovic will now look to finish the season strong with one eye on the World Cup, with Montreal's next match set for August 31 against the New York Red Bulls.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/usmnt-midfielder-mihailovic-completes-transfer-to-az-alkmaar/blt18bfc0113feed7a2,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
904,Neymar & Messi lead the way as PSG populate entire top 10 list of highest Ligue 1 earners,"Neymar and Lionel Messi are leading the way in the top 10 list of highest Ligue 1 earners, which is populated entirely by Paris Saint-Germain players. PSG have been one of the richest clubs in world football since Qatar Sports Investments' successful takeover at Parc des Princes in 2011. Marquee signings have become a regular occurrence over the past decade and, after the additions of several more household names last summer, including Messi, L'Equipe reports that the squad is now worth a total of €629 million (£525m/$692m). The French newspaper has also published a top 30 list of the highest salaries in Ligue 1 for 2021-22, with Brazilian forward Neymar out in front with gross monthly earnings of €4m. Messi, who joined PSG on a free transfer after leaving Barcelona at the end of the 2020-21 campaign, comes in second on €3.3m, over €1m ahead of third-place Kylian Mbappe. Marquinhos and Marco Verratti are up next in fourth and fifth, while Achraf Hakimi, Keylor Navas, Angel Di Maria, Georginio Wijnaldum and Gianluigi Donnarumma fill the remaining spots in the top 10.

Ramos joined PSG last summer, too, after seeing his contract at Real Madrid expire, but is only taking home €791,666 per month as the 12th highest-paid player at Parc des Princes. Ben Yedder's Stade Louis II team-mate Cesc Fabregas is the only other non-PSG star to make the top 20, while Marseille duo Cedric Bakambu and Dimitri Payet come in at 23rd and 29th respectively. Lyon have only grabbed two spots in the overall list, with Tanguy Ndombele, who is currently on loan from Tottenham, and Jerome Boateng landing at 27th and 28th.

9349,"Joselu - 9, Vinicius - 5: Rating Real Madrid players in Getafe win","Real Madrid have beaten Getafe to go top of the league. Here's how are players faredJoselu - 9Today was Joselu's day to show Madridistas just what he's all about. The 33-year-old was a destructive force for that Getafe defence all game and was duly rewarded with a well-taken brace. The Spaniard could've added an assist if Vinicius was a little more clinical with his cutback. Bellingham - 8One thing Jude Bellingham will never be accused of in his career is a lack of effort. The midfielder put in a shift and was too powerful for Getafe's athletic midfield. He didn't score but he also didn't lose the ball, misplace a pass or dibbled past. It was a top performance by Jude once again. Vazquez - 7.5Lucas Vazquez started the party for Real Madrid with that sublime cross for Joselu to open the scoring. Some Real Madrid fans couldn't believe he had that in his locker. Vazquez continued to probe and could've added two more assists to his name if Joselu was luckier. It was a good performance from the Spaniard. Modric - 7Luka Modric continues to age like fine wine. Once again the Croatian showed his quality as he played as the number 8 in Real Madrid's four-man midfield. He barely gave the ball away and set his team on the move with his incredible passing range. Lunin - 7Perhaps Lunin has cemented his place as Real Madrid's first-choice goalie. He was neat and tidy in goal against Getafe and smothered everything that came his way. Madrid's defence did not panic knowing their goal was secured by safe hands from Ukraine. Vinicius - 5The Brazilian was not at his clinical best today. In the first half, Vini missed a huge chance when put one-on-one with the goalkeeper. He was easily shut down by the Getafe defence. He gets a rating of 5 for his sublime assist for Joselu's second goal. It's what top players do, even on their off day they still manage to affect the game somehow. Other players.

10933,The Biggest Champions League Final Wins,"Manchester City are firm favourites ahead of their date with Inter, but what are the biggest ever UEFA Champions League final wins? All eyes will be on Istanbul this weekend as the Turkish capital plays host to the UEFA Champions League final of Manchester City vs Inter Milan, a clash many are already predicting to be one-sided. As big a club as Inter are historically, it’s fair to say few expected them to get this far at the start of the season. It might even be argued they’re one of the most surprising Champions League finalists in 30 years of finals. Man City are the firm favourites as they seek a maiden Champions League trophy. So far they’ve swept aside all the competition in Europe, the Premier League and FA Cup, leaving them on the brink of the treble. If they do beat Inter, they’ll only be the second English side ever to win the top domestic league, FA Cup and European Cup/Champions League in a single season after Sir Alex Ferguson’s iconic 1999 Manchester United team. These title games tend to be fairly close affairs, but given the brilliance of City and the phenomenal goalscoring exploits of star man Erling Haaland, it’s only natural to wonder what it’d take for them to secure the treble with the biggest Champions League final win ever. City boss Pep Guardiola was part of the Barcelona side that went into the 1994 Champions League final as clear favourites. Milan were without a host of key players, such as Marco van Basten, Gianluigi Lentini, plus Italy greats Franco Baresi and Alessandro Costacurta, yet they went on to blow Johan Cruyff’s Barca away. Daniele Massaro put Milan in front with a close-range finish after an off-balance Dejan Savićević managed to get the ball to the back post, and then made it 2-0 just before the break with a fine strike following Roberto Donadoni’s excellent left-wing run and cut-back. Savićević effectively put the game beyond Barca less than two minutes after the restart with an outrageous lob from the right-hand perimeter of the Milan box, and a gorgeous Marcel Desailly curler sealed victory before the hour. Milan’s win in Athens remains the only Champions League final to be settled by a four-goal margin, meaning this is the barrier City – or Inter – will need to break to set a new record on Saturday. Four Champions League finals have been won by three-goal deficits, the most recent of which came in 2017 when Madrid defeated Juventus to become the first team to win the competition back-to-back. Cristiano Ronaldo swept home a Dani Carvajal cut-back to make it 1-0 with Madrid’s first shot in the 20th minute, and although Mario Mandžukić’s astonishing overhead-kick made it 1-1 soon after, Zinedine Zidane’s side got the job done with three goals in the second half. Casemiro’s deflected long-range strike put Madrid back in front, then Ronaldo got his 10th of the knockout stages alone from Luka Modrić’s cross. Juan Cuadrado’s second yellow card six minutes from time for pushing Sergio Ramos essentially killed off Juventus’ chances of a fightback, and Marco Asensio got Madrid’s fourth with a tidy finish when latching on to Marcelo’s pull-back. It was the Bianconeri’s fifth consecutive Champions League final defeat. So, this entry has an asterisk because Madrid needed extra-time to see off their neighbours Atlético – in fact, this game was agonisingly close to being a 1-0 win for Diego Simeone’s side. Diego Godín’s first-half opener – a looping header over Iker Casillas – in Lisbon looked as though it’d be enough for a maiden European Cup/Champions League success for Atlético, but Madrid weren’t to be denied La Décima. Sergio Ramos’ dramatic headed equaliser deep into second-half stoppage time ensured the game went to an extra 30 minutes, and Gareth Bale nodded Real Madrid in front with 110 minutes on the clock after great work by Ángel Di Maria. Then-Atlético ‘keeper Thibaut Courtois failed to keep out Marcelo’s 20-yard drive, and a Ronaldo penalty – which he won – finished things off at the end. The win that elevated José Mourinho to football manager superstardom and secured a move Chelsea. Both Porto and Monaco had captured the imaginations of neutrals with their unlikely journeys to the Champions League final in 2004, but Gelsenkirchen played host to a showpiece that proved fairly one-sided by the end. Livewire attacking midfield star Carlos Alberto put Porto in front with an instinctive volley into the top-right corner six minutes before half-time. Monaco remained in the contest for a while after that, but Deco linked up well with Dmitri Alenichev in the 71st minute to make it 2-0 courtesy of a delicate, disguised finish into the bottom-left corner. Alenichev put Monaco to bed with an emphatic volley a few minutes later, making Porto the first – and only – club from Portugal to win the Champions League, a year after winning the Europa League (UEFA Cup as it was then). The first European Cup or Champions League final to be contested by two teams from the same nation, success at the Stade de France salvaged an otherwise underwhelming season for Real Madrid, whose haul of 62 points in La Liga remains their worst in a single campaign this century in Spain’s top flight. Fernando Morientes got Madrid’s first, heading in from Míchel Salgado’s cross, before Steve McManaman – who became the first English player to win the competition with a non-English club – fired in a brilliant volley from the edge of the box. Raúl sealed the win 15 minutes from the end, rounding Santiago Cañizares to finish off a counter-attack and give coach Vicente del Bosque his first title as a coach. There may have only been five Champions League finals settled by a deficit of three or more goals, but there were also a handful European Cup finals, with Real Madrid’s hammering of Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960 most iconic among them. It remarkably included half of all hat-tricks ever scored in a European Cup/Champions League final, with Alfredo Di Stéfano netting three and Ferenc Puskás plundering four as the Spanish side won the competition for a fifth time in a row. Another asterisk. Atlético actually found themselves within a minute of European Cup success but were pegged back right at the end of extra-time, Bayern rescuing a 1-1 draw in Brussels to force a replay a couple of days later. The Bundesliga giants then ran riot, with Uli Hoeneß and Gerd Müller scoring two apiece. Their victory officially ended one dynasty – given Ajax had won the competition three times in succession beforehand – and started another, as Bayern took the crown back to Germany in 1975 and 1976 as well. The Rossoneri went double-double Dutch at Camp Nou in May 1989, with Ruud Gullit and Van Basten each getting a brace as Steaua – champions three years earlier – were brushed aside emphatically on the grand stage. Milan became the first side to score more than three goals in a European Cup final (excluding replays) since 1969. That’s right, the last team to achieve that feat before Milan were the Rossoneri themselves. Rinus Michels’ legendary Ajax team had to make do with the runners-up spot as they were no match for the Italians. Milan were inspired by the hat-trick of Pierino Prati – no one has scored a treble in a European Cup or Champions League final since. Defeat prevented Ajax becoming the first Dutch team to win the European Cup, as Feyenoord took that honour a year later. But their day soon arrived, with Michels guiding them to the title in 1971, before Ștefan Kovács led Cruyff and Co. to success in each of the following two seasons. Sir Matt Busby’s Man Utd became the first English team – not British, as Celtic had that honour – to be crowned European champions in 1968, though the 4-1 scoreline makes it sound more straightforward than it was, as three of their goals were scored in extra-time. England legend Bobby Charlton scored two of United’s goals, with Brian Kidd and George Best also on the scoresheet. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

5058,"Heartbreak and disgust: Liverpool come up short, but UEFA should be ashamed by Champions League final chaos","Match statistics: Liverpool 0-1 Real Madrid The tears will dry and the anger will subside. But it will take a while. A day which started with such hope and such promise ended only in heartbreak for Liverpool. Well, heartbreak, rage, disbelief and disgust, if you want the full picture. Mistreated off the pitch, they were pickpocketed on it. Vinicius Junior’s second-half strike settled this Champions League final, and ensured that for the 14th time, Real Madrid will get their hands on club football’s most famous trophy. At the end, Liverpool’s players sunk to the floor, broken. They’d given everything they had, but it wasn’t enough. A game too far, you might say, but were it not for the heroics of Thibaut Courtois, we’d be talking about the perfect end to a quite magnificent season for the Reds. Instead, their incredible journey ends here, in Paris and in disappointment. Close, but not quite close enough. The cruel world of elite-level football, summed up in a neat, 90-minute package. How they lost is anyone’s guess. How they didn’t score should be the subject of future theses. Courtois was super-human, denying Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane in the first half, then Salah on three occasions in the second. Each save was different, each was crucial. Salah alone had six shots, more than anyone has ever managed in a Champions League final, but he, and Liverpool, could find no way past the giant Belgian. Their fans, meanwhile, were discovering just how bad UEFA are at organising big football events, and just how unsympathetic the French police can be towards travelling supporters. What happened outside the stadium should shame the authorities, and demands an immediate - and thorough - investigation. How on earth did we end up with a situation like this, with the kick off of the biggest game in club football delayed by more than half an hour, because hundreds of Liverpool fans were stuck outside, waiting behind a locked gate? How do we get to the point where those fans, with legitimate tickets, were then attacked with tear gas and pepper spray, and then, ridiculously but not surprisingly, held up as the cause of the issue by UEFA? Fans with tickets, locked out, tear gassed. Treated like dogs because the organisers didn't organise. #LFC 🔴 #UCLfinal pic.twitter.com/qXBzuo3qmH Inside the stadium, we were told that the kick off had been delayed because fans had “arrived late”. It was crass and predictable, a blatant attempt to deflect the blame away from those who deserve it. Organisers who failed to organise, blaming ordinary supporters for their own errors. The fans outside told us the truth, and we should listen to them. This was no late arrival, it wasn’t misbehaviour or anything sinister. It was supporters arriving at a European Cup final and being treated like dogs. “Unacceptable,” said Liverpool in a statement, which also called for a formal investigation into events outside the ground. UEFA’s response was to blame “fake tickets” for the problems, again attempting to lay the blame at the feet of fans, many of whom missed some or all of the first half of the game, some of whom turned back and went home, their evening and their weekend ruined before Real Madrid even got a chance to do it. You don’t have to look far to find the truth. You can read it in the accounts of the supporters, but if you prefer you can look back through the tweets of Gary Lineker and Kelly Cates. You could ask Joel Matip’s brother, Marvin, who was caught up in the mayhem along with his pregnant wife, or Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler, who spent most of the first half outside the ground, trying to help his brother and son. I’m not sure it’s possible to have a more poorly organised event if you tried. Absolutely shambolic and dangerous. @UEFAcom What about Liverpool owner Mike Gordon, who also witnessed the scenes first-hand? Other Liverpool employees suffered. A reporter from the Associated Press was dragged into a hut and told to delete any video footage he had captured on his phone, or he would have his accreditation taken away. Journalists were there to witness it all. UEFA can issue as many statements as they like, but this is 2022, where everything is seen and everything is captured. They, and the French authorities, must not be allowed to brush this one under the carpet, or worse, to pass the buck. As for Liverpool’s players, they can only reflect on what might have been. After seeing the Premier League title elude them last weekend, they watched the Champions League slip away this time around. There’s a victory parade planned on Merseyside on Sunday, and though they deserve the appreciation and adulation that their supporters will give them, it will be a tough one to get up for, for Jurgen Klopp and his team. They’ll come again, for sure. They’re too good not to. Their season will be judged harshly in the coming days, no doubt, as pundits and rival fans stick the knife in, but the fact remains that they came closer than any English side has ever come to achieving the impossible. One more point, one more goal, one less-brilliant opposing goalkeeper perhaps, and they’d have had the lot. As it is, they must content themselves with the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup, and with the ride they have taken their fans on this season. It’s been special to report on, never mind to live it or to play in it. When the dust settles they can be proud, and they will. But it will take a little bit of time. Paris is the city of love, but it broke their hearts here. They won’t forget tonight in a hurry.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/heartbreak-disgust-liverpool-uefa-ashamed-champions-league-final-/blt9c37a91485eb9c42,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
9880,The 2023 Premier League Disappointment,"The American sports portal ESPN has presented its traditional selection of disappointments in the English Premier League. The Ukrainian winger of London's Chelsea, Mykhailo Mudryk, is also included. A little more than a year ago, the most expensive and talked-about transfer in the history of Ukrainian football occurred. Mudryk was marketed as an exceptional football talent, standing among the world's most accomplished players. The best clubs in the Premier League fought for him, and the expectations of him were sky-high. But in a year of playing for Chelsea, Mudryk has fallen to the year's disappointment. Who is Mudryk? Mykhailo Mudryk is a Ukrainian football player who plays winger for Chelsea and the Ukrainian national team. He was born on January 5, 2001, in Krasnograd, Ukraine. He began his career at Shakhtar Donetsk. In 2019, he debuted in the Ukrainian Premier League with Arsenal Kyiv. In early August 2020, he joined Chernihiv Desna until the end of the 2020/21 season. Mudryk quickly became one of the most promising young players in Ukraine. In the 2021/22 season, he scored three goals and provided nine assists in 19 games for Shakhtar. In the 2022/23 season, he became the fastest player in the Champions League group stage and was named one of the top 10 dribblers in the tournament. In 2022, Mudryk was named the best Ukrainian footballer. In the first half of the season, he played 18 games, scoring ten goals and providing nine assists. In January 2023, Mudryk joined Chelsea for €70 million (€100 million with add-ons). He signed a contract until 2031. You can follow Chelsea team matches, game predictions, and statistics on bookmaker sites. At https://stavnice.bet/, you will find reviews of reliable world bookmakers. Mudryk is a versatile midfielder who can play on either the left or right wing. He has good speed, excellent dribbling skills, and strong technique. Footballer's failure in his first year at Chelsea Note that we in no way call Mudryk a bad footballer. We are trying to understand why a well-known American publication included the Ukrainian in the list of disappointments. A year of adaptation is enough to get used to a new country, learn the language, and resolve everyday matters. There is also plenty of time to get along with a new team. In addition, Mudryk managed to train under two Chelsea head coaches, make his debut in the Champions League playoffs, play against English teams, and be in the reserves and the starting lineup. The footballer was admired and criticized; he went through a real school of life.  Here are the arguments why Mudryk is the disappointment of 2023: - The first match against Liverpool made Mudryk famous, but everything went wrong. Only after a couple of months, in the 7th match against Leicester, did the Ukrainian distinguish himself with an assist on Kovacic. - Mudryk played 38 matches out of 50 possible for his club. But the playing time indicator is impressive in a negative sense. In the Premier League this season, Mudryk appeared in less than half of the total playing time, and in the League Cup, only 24%. It is not the result that is expected from him. - In only 38% of matches, Mudryk started on the field. It only suggests that he still has a long way to go before reaching stability. - Four goals and four assists – that's all Mudryk did for the whole year playing for Chelsea.  - After a couple of months after the transfer to Chelsea, Mudryk fell in price by almost a third. Things could be going better for the Ukrainian footballer. We do not set out to criticize Mudryk as a footballer. Enough time has passed for adaptation, but he is only 23. Let's wish him success in football matches and greater effectiveness in the new season. You can support the footballer and view the statistics on the website of the online bookmaker Ivibet SI.

11688,The Analyst Diary – March 14,"Cristiano Ronaldo’s first Premier League hat-trick, on the 12th day of January 2008 took place in a world quite different from his second, scored on the 12th day of March 2022. That gap of more than 14 years has obliterated the record for time between first and last Premier League trebles by a single player, previously held by Wayne Rooney at just over 11 years. Ronaldo, meanwhile, is now up to 807 goals, which is the sort of total that triggers vague phrases like “lays claim” because it is apparently the case that he has now overtaken Austro-Czech goal machine Josef Bican for the (admittedly quite cool) title of “professional football’s all-time leading scorer”. As always with records that stretch back into the early mists of the game, no-one is quite sure whether it’s true or not, although that didn’t stop people magically remembering “Jimmy Dunne” when Jamie Vardy did something good in 2015. Cristiano Ronaldo has now scored as many PL hat-tricks as Kevin Nolan So records galore for Ronaldo but the Manchester United veteran still has work to do if he is to become the Premier League’s oldest hat-trick scorer, a landmark held by Teddy Sheringham thanks to a classic three-goal salvo against Bolton in August 2003, the same month that Ronaldo made his Premier League debut. It’s interesting to look at the top five oldest hat-tricks and see just how frequent they were at the turn of the century, thanks to Sheringham and helicopter pilot Les Ferdinand. Furthermore, Ronaldo’s modern antics against Spurs at the weekend have pushed Ian Wright out of the top five, and as we all know, he will remain the top-scoring Premier League player to score all of his goals in the 1990s forever more. That’s one record Ronaldo can’t nab, at least. In a disappointing Sunday afternoon for Southampton supporters, what with the club losing at home to relegation-haunted Watford, they did at least witness Oriol Romeu record a tiny bit of Premier League history. The midfielder, who still feels like a prospect despite the fact he turns 31 later this year, has now equalled Luke Young’s record of most-yellow-cards-without-ever-being-sent-off, both players with 62 each, 10 ahead of Ashley Westwood and 11 ahead of James McArthur. The ability to make sanctionable fouls when your team needs one, but never to do it so badly or regularly that the referee reaches ominously for his back pocket, is admirable. You would imagine that Romeu will be able to stretch ahead in the coming months but should he finally get a red card, listen carefully and you might be able to hear Luke Young, who collected a yellow card in his final ever Premier League appearance in March 2012, cheering in the background as he regains top spot. It was a good weekend for goalkeepers doing things a little bit differently. Firstly, in a development that was always theoretically possible but rated by experts as extremely unlikely, Wycombe actually took a short goal kick, with David Stockdale passing to colleague Ryan Tafazolli inside the box like some sort of Ederson figure. As you can see on the graphic below, Wycombe’s favoured tactic from goal kicks since the law was adjusted in 2019 remains achingly traditional. And up in the Premier League on Sunday, Norwich’s eagerness to score at Leeds saw Tim Krul create a goalscoring chance for Teemu Pukki. Of course, it’s not unheard of for ‘keepers to trouble this metric – three of them have a total of three chances created so far this season – but they tend to be passes hit from deep or free-kicks near the halfway line. Krul, in contrast, did his business in the D, and you have to respect the craftsmanship on show.

6696,Watch: Harry Kane appears on Jimmy Fallon's 'The Tonight Show' talking Tom Brady and a possible NFL career,"Tottenham striker Harry Kane has reiterated his desire to try American football once his days as a soccer superstar are over, with the England captain revealing seven-time Super Bowl winner Tom Brady played a part in setting him on his own path to greatness. The 28-year-old remains a prolific presence in the Premier League, but he had to be patient in pursuit of a breakthrough at Spurs and once turned to inspiration from the legendary quarterback, who was famously the 199th pick of the 2000 NFL draft. New England Patriots legend Brady, who has shelved retirement plans in 2022 to continue his career with  Tampa Bay Buccaneers, has shown what is capable with the right blend of attitude and ability, with Kane hoping to continue a similar path. Discussing how the GOAT of NFL helped to convince him he could become a star in his own right, Kane said: “One thing that did inspire me growing up was a Tom Brady documentary. “I was away at another club on loan and I wasn’t getting in the team, it was that period – I was 18 years old – and it was like ‘If I can’t play here, how can I play for my team Tottenham?’ “I came across this documentary on YouTube, I think it was called ‘The Brady Six’, it was about how he got picked in the sixth round and then became what he has become – one of the greatest sportsmen ever. “It gave me a real belief that it was possible for me to go on and have that career. Thankfully I was able to go that.” While there are transferable skills between soccer and American football, especially in the placekicking position, few players have crossed codes at an elite level. Kane remains keen to explore that option, and said: “I feel like I could. I’d put myself up there, for sure.” For now, Kane's focus is on events at Tottenham and readying himself for the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar later this year. He will head to the Middle East as skipper of the Three Lions and with Wayne Rooney’s all-time record goal mark of 53 in his sights as he sits on 49 efforts from 69 appearances. Asked about his emotions ahead of the global showpiece in November, Kane said: “I’m excited. The last World Cup was really special – we got to the semi-final, which was the first semi-final we got to in 30 years. “The country was going pretty mad, but of course we fell that one step short. I’m really looking forward to this one. “We have a great team, really good players, really good coach and we have been building nicely to this World Cup. Hopefully I can try and break that goal record while we are there.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/watch-harry-kane-jimmy-fallon-tottenham-tom-brady-nfl/bltafa60ea248a2b6e1,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7341,Afcon 2021 final: Does Sadio Mane want Salah’s Egypt or Cameroon?,"Sadio Mane has no preference whether Senegal face Africa Cup of Nations hosts Cameroon or Egypt, and his Liverpool teammate Mohamed Salah, in Sunday’s final in Yaounde. The 29-year-old was influential as the Teranga Lions dispatched Burkina Faso in Wednesday’s first semi-final at the Stade Amadou Ahidjo, and netted Senegal’s third three minutes from time to kill off the contest. Mane had earlier contributed the assist for Idrissa Gueye’s goal to double Senegal’s lead after Abdou Diallo’s opener, and while Blati Toure had given Burkina Faso hope with eight minutes to play, the Senegal talisman’s 87th-minute goal ensured the Lions progressed to the final. Ahead of Thursday’s second semi-final between Cameroon and Egypt, Mane resisted the opportunity to reveal that he’s keen to either play against or avoid his Anfield teammate Salah in the continental showpiece. “We have no preference who we play,” Mane told GOAL after Senegal’s victory. “The only thing is that we must win it, that’s the question. “You can see how happy I am now, and it’s completely normal,” he added. “I’m proud personally, and I’m also happy for myself, my teammates and all the country—we played well today. “I know it wouldn’t be an easy game, but we expected this kind of match and we won the game—that’s the most important thing.” As has been the case throughout their Nations Cup campaign, Senegal—who are yet to score in the first half of a fixture—started slowly, with Burkina Faso enjoying several chances before the break. Two Senegal penalty shouts were denied by VAR before the Teranga Lions took the initiative in the 70th minute. “We had a strong team in front of us in Burkina Faso, we expected a difficult match and it was the case; they caused us a lot of problems,” he continued. “However, we showed our superiority, kept calm, settled into our game, created chances, and we deserved to win tonight. “I try to do my best in each match, and as you saw—we had to be physically strong during the first 45-60 minutes, and we showed that today. “We’re proud of that, and we are happy to be solid both mentally and physically.” Senegal’s victory sends them to the Nations Cup final for the second consecutive edition of the Afcon, the first team since Egypt in 2010 to make back-to-back finals. Their task now is to bring home the big one, with the Teranga Lions having previously featured in two finals without clinching Africa’s grandest prize. “It’s not easy to play in two finals back to back, it’s never happened before for Senegal, but the most important thing now is that we have to get to the end—to win the tournament.” Egypt and Cameroon meet in the second semi-final at the Stade d’Olembe on Thursday, with the winner advancing Sunday’s final at the same venue.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/afcon-2021-final-does-sadio-mane-want-salah-s-egypt-or/blt444ba0f249ce17be,Ed Dove,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6278,"Crystal Palace vs Liverpool: Predictions, odds & betting tips","This article contains affiliate links. We may receive a commission on any sales we generate from it Crystal Palace will be hoping to record a long-awaited victory over Liverpool when the sides meet at Selhurst Park for Sunday’s Premier League clash. The Eagles have not beaten this opposition since 2017, suffering a defeat in each of the nine subsequent meetings. However, Crystal Palace can be backed at 5/1 (6.0) with bet365 to turn that record around by beating a team missing key attacking duo Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. Jurgen Klopp’s men booked their place in the EFL Cup final by beating Arsenal 2-0 on Thursday and Liverpool are available at 8/15 (1.53) to come out on top in the capital once again here. The visitors' last two away league games have both resulted in draws, and there are odds of 16/5 (4.20) on them being held to another stalemate in this one. Odsonne Edouard is the hosts’ 9/1 (10.0) favourite to open the scoring after goals in two of his last three league matches, while Christian Benteke is priced at 10/1 (11.0) against his former club. Diogo Jota is the 10/3 (4.33) favourite to break the deadlock following 10 goals in 17 league starts this season, with Roberto Firmino priced at 13/2 (7.50) at a ground where he has scored five times in six previous visits. While his team’s record against this opposition is extremely poor, Patrick Vieira will see this game as an excellent opportunity to pull off an upset against a team missing some key men. Mane has scored in each of his last 10 games against Palace, while Salah has hit the net seven times in 10 encounters - with that duo joined by fellow Afcon absentee Naby Keita on the scoresheet in September’s 3-0 win at Anfield. With Liverpool having failed to win any of their last three away games in the league and missing their main goalscorers, odds of 11/8 (2.38) could prove strong value on them failing to win at a ground where the hosts have lost only twice in 11 fixtures this season. All odds correct at time of writing. 18+. begambleaware.org.

4416,Liverpool boss Klopp on Salah contract: We can't do much more,"Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has confirmed that no further progress has been made in talks between the club and Mohamed Salah over a new contract.  Salah, 29, sees his current deal expire at the end of next season.  The Reds would be loathe to lose one of the world's premier strikers, and one moreover who is in the form of his life right now.  ""Mo definitely expects this club to be ambitious,"" Klopp explained to reporters on Friday.  ""We were in the last few years and we are. ""We cannot do much more, that's how it is. But I don't think it's about that. It's Mo's decision pretty much. The club did what the club can do. That's how it is. ""Nothing bad to say about it. It's fine from my point of view. ""It's exactly like it should be in this moment in time. Everything is set. Nothing happened further, no signing, no rejection or whatever. ""We just have to wait for that. It's completely fine. No rush in that situation."" Klopp's words appeared to elicit a strong reaction from Salah's agent, Ramy Abbas.  Shortly after the manager's conference Abbas took to Twitter and, while he did not offer any words in his message, a torrent of laughing faces certainly encouraged the interpretation that he may not have been impressed with what he heard.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 One factor in Salah and his agent's favour is that given his current form, the Egyptian would have no shortage of suitors waiting to pick him up on a free transfer in 2023.  The forward has smashed 27 goals in 34 games this season in all competitions for the Reds, who have already lifted the Carabao Cup and remain competitive in the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-klopp-salah-contract-we-cant-do-much-more/bltd3ca6d960cdf6f6c,Daniel Edwards,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

5501,Benzema explains why he took high-risk Panenka penalty for Real Madrid in 4-3 loss to Manchester City,"Karim Benzema has explained why he took a high-risk Panenka penalty for Real Madrid in their 4-3 loss to Manchester City. Benzema scored twice in a thrilling contest at Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night, including the all-important final goal of the game that gives the Blancos real hope of a comeback in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final tie. The veteran striker showed nerves of steel from the penalty spot to chip the ball down the centre, taking his overall tally of goals for the season to 41 in the process. Benzema missed two penalties in Madrid's last Liga outing against Osasuna, but those failures did nothing to shake his self-confidence and prevent him from stepping up again on Europe's biggest stage. Asked why he chose to try a Panenka against Man City, the 34-year-old told reporters post-match: ""I always have it in my head that if you don't take a penalty, you will never miss a penalty.  ""That's mental confidence and that's all. I have a lot of confidence in myself, so I do it and it turns out well.""  Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti was full of praise for Benzema after his latest showing, and also revealed the Frenchman practised the new penalty technique prior to the trip to Manchester. ""I think he changed because the last two penalties were not good,"" the Italian tactician said. ""He tried in training, I didn't know how he would shoot. He chose this [Panenka] and he did really well, showing strong personality and character.  ""It's not easy in the semi-final of the Champions League to shoot a penalty like this."" Benzema will likely lead the line for Madrid again when they welcome Man City to Santiago Bernabeu for the return leg on May 4.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/benzema-panenka-penalty-real-madrid-man-city/blt1cf7ededa14c4248,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10001,Football Etiquette: Dos and Don'ts for Football Fans Attending Matches,"You've secured your tickets, and the anticipation for an exhilarating match day is building. As you gear up for the big event, it's essential to be aware of the dos and don'ts that can shape your experience and that of those around you.This guide will steer you through the nuances of good match day etiquette, ensuring that your presence contributes to the vibrant and positive atmosphere every football fan seeks. So, whether you're a seasoned supporter or a first-timer, let's dive straight into the key considerations that will make your match day memorable and enjoyable for all.Dos for Football FansIt’s our collective responsibility to make sure every football match is enjoyable for all of those involved. Here are some things you should do on and before the big day.Arrive Early and Be PreparedTo ensure the day goes smoothly, make sure you allow adequate travel time and arrive at the match early. This will allow you to soak in the pre-game excitement, find your seat without trouble, and contribute to a smoother flow of the crowd. Be prepared by packing essentials like tickets, identification, and any other items you need for the day. Above all, arrive with a smile, and enjoy your time in the stadium.Respect Seating AssignmentsRespecting seating assignments is another fundamental aspect of a positive match day experience. Remaining in your designated seat and avoiding seat changes helps prevent confusion and potential conflicts, allowing everyone to fully relish the game. It's a simple yet crucial gesture that showcases consideration for fellow fans and maintains the integrity of the seating arrangement.Support Your Team ResponsiblyCheering your team on adds to the whole atmosphere in the stadium, but doing so responsibly is key to maintaining a positive atmosphere. Cheer passionately, wave your team colours, and engage in chants that uplift without resorting to offensive language or gestures. You should avoid taunting rival fans and focus on celebrating your team's achievements rather than the opposing team's downfalls. Follow Stadium Rules and RegulationsAdhering to stadium rules will keep you out of trouble and ensure everyone has a pleasant match day. Before you go, familiarise yourself with prohibited items, smoking areas, and emergency procedures. Follow entry and exit protocols, as these will contribute to efficient flow of the crowd. Handle Tickets ResponsiblyKeep hold of your tickets and treat them as valuable assets! Avoid bending or tearing them, and make sure they're not exposed to adverse conditions such as rain. A well-looked-after ticket guarantees you entry to the match and prevents any last-minute complications.Once you've reached the stadium, be mindful of the specified entry gates and access points on the ticket — this will save you time and hassle, preventing you from ending up at the wrong gate.Purchase Tickets Through Authorised SourcesAlways buy your Premier League tickets and other football tickets through authorised sources to guarantee a legitimate and secure purchase. Buying from reputable outlets or the official website ensures authenticity, reducing the risk of scams or counterfeit tickets. You'll also be contributing to a fair and regulated ticketing system, promoting authentic ticket providers.Don’ts for Football FansAmongst the excitement of the game, there are a few things you should always avoid in order to maintain a positive atmosphere for everyone: Excessive DrinkingIndulging in excessive alcohol consumption not only poses risks to your own well-being but can also lead to disruptive behaviour that affects those around you. It's crucial to drink responsibly, allowing everyone to partake in the match day festivities without any negative incidents.Offensive BehaviourSportsmanship is a cornerstone of the football experience. Avoid engaging in offensive language, gestures, or taunts directed at players, officials, or fellow fans. Respecting the diverse fan base contributes to an inclusive and enjoyable atmosphere for everyone present.Unauthorised AccessStadiums have designated areas for a reason, and attempting unauthorised access can lead to disruptions and security concerns — which could potentially disrupt the entire match. It's important to respect the rules and guidelines set by the venue, ensuring a secure and organised environment for all attendees.Excessive NoiseWhile passionate support is encouraged, it's essential to be mindful of the noise level. Excessive shouting or disruptive behaviour can detract from the overall enjoyment of the game for fellow fans. Striking a balance allows everyone to revel in the excitement without unnecessary disturbances.Violence or Aggressive BehaviourIt goes without saying that violence and aggressive behaviour has no place in our football stadiums. Any form of aggressive behaviour is strictly prohibited, and a zero-tolerance policy is in effect. If you witness or experience such incidents, you should always report them to security so the matter can be dealt with. Misuse of TicketsMisuse of tickets is a serious violation of football match etiquette and can have consequences for both individuals and the overall fan experience. Avoid and report any fraudulent activities and unauthorised transferring or selling or tickets. You should also be aware that the consequences for misuse of tickets can result in legal action and bans from future events. ConclusionIn the world of football, good ticketing etiquette is the key to an enjoyable match day experience. It's not just about having a piece of paper that grants you access; it's about creating a positive atmosphere for everyone. Respecting your assigned seating, arriving early, and supporting your team with enthusiasm while being mindful of fellow fans are the building blocks of good match day etiquette.",https://tribuna.com/en/news/mancity-2024-02-08-football-etiquette-dos-and-donts-for-football-fans-attending-matches/,Alex,2024-02-08T10:35:33.000Z,

518,Scholes eviscerates Man Utd's Rangnick appointment with 'six games' comment after Atletico Madrid defeat,"Paul Scholes has taken aim at Manchester United boss Ralf Rangnick, questioning how the club ever thought hiring the German boss could be a good idea. Rangnick was appointed as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's temporary successor, with the former RB Leipzig architect handed the reins until the end of the season until he moves into an advisory role. But, after Tuesday's loss to Atletico Madrid that sealed the club's Champions League elimination, Manchester United legend Scholes didn't hold back in his assessment of the manager. ""How [Rangnick] was chosen to be manager of this club, I don't know,"" Scholes said on BT Sport.  ""Getting a proper coach for this team is a massive thing. There's some real talent in this squad.  ""The very first thing this club needs to do to get anywhere near winning the league again is getting in a proper coach who works for this team.""  He added: ""I don't know how this man was chosen to be manager of Manchester United. Not for six months, not for six weeks, not for six games."" Even before kickoff, Scholes was talking up the importance of bringing in the right manager when Rangnick ultimately steps aside. The former midfielder earmarked two current Premier League managers while explaining the key factor in what will make the club's next coach successful or not. ""I would have gone for [Antonio]Conte or [Thomas] Tuchel,"" Scholes said. ""It looks like one might be available at the end of the season.  ""Those are two top-class coaches that strike fear into players and win, which is the most important thing. United, with either one of those managers, would be much better off. ""You need a manager that strikes fear into players, Sir Alex Ferguson had that, have any of the managers since him had that? I don’t think so. It’s a special talent to have as a coach.  ""Those Man City players under Pep [Guardiola], those Liverpool players under [Jurgen]Klopp, they’ll get away with nothing. These players here for the last two or three years have got away with murder.  ""I’m not saying they’ll catch Man City or Liverpool. But I don’t think they’re far away from Chelsea, squad-wise, but once they get that right coach and have two or three years to build, they’ll be challenging again.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/scholes-eviscerates-man-utd-s-rangnick-appointment-with-six/blt2c326582f96b0e50,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11919,The Data Day No. 4: Our Rolling Football Blog,"Welcome to The Data Day, our rolling football stats blog for 2021-22, where we try and make sense of what just happened. The Carabao Cup welcomed back the Premier League clubs this midweek as Round 2 kicked off. Here’s a look at some of the top-line numbers as we overview the action from Tuesday and Wednesday. 2021-22’s second round saw just two Premier League clubs exit – Crystal Palace and Newcastle, with both of these suffering eliminations from two other top-flight teams. Not since 2016-17 (one) have we seen as few Premier League clubs eliminated at this stage of the competition. At first glance, 41 goals from the 13 Premier League clubs over the last two nights feels like a lot – it’s 3.15 per game, after all. However, it’s only the most since Round 3 from last season when the 14 top-flight sides over those three nights scored 48 times. Southampton enjoyed their biggest away win in their history last night, as they thrashed League Two outfit Newport County. This win also equalled the biggest away wins seen in the history of the English League Cup, with Southampton becoming the first team to score eight times away from home in the competition in 21 years. October 3, 1989: Aldershot 0-8 Sheffield Wednesday (Round 2, Leg 2)August 11, 1997: Doncaster Rovers 0-8 Nottingham Forest (Round 1, Leg 1)November 29, 2000: Stoke City 0-8 Liverpool (Round 4)August 25, 2021: Newport County 0-8 Southampton (Round 2) Mohamed Elyounoussi scored three of Southampton’s goals in the win and in doing so became the first Norwegian to score a hat-trick in professional English football since Josh King for Bournemouth vs. West Ham in the Premier League back in March 2017. Mohamed Elyounoussi wasn’t the only player to net a hat-trick in this round of the League Cup, as his feat was replicated by Pierre Emerick Aubameyang (Arsenal), Aiden O’Brien (Sunderland), Cameron Archer (Aston Villa) and Morgan Whittaker (Swansea). With five hat-trick scorers in Round 2 this season, that’s the most in a single round of the League Cup since Round 1 in 2000-01 with six – but those six came back when there were two-legged ties, so essentially came on different ‘matchdays’. The last time five were scored on a single matchday of the EFL cup was back in 1993-94 when six were scored in Round 2 first-leg matches – Andy Cole scored one on that night for Newcastle United vs. Notts County and then replicated the feat in the second leg just two weeks later. Outstanding. This next fact comes courtesy of Opta’s UK data hero Tom Ede, who tells us that Tuesday was the first day of League Cup action to see three hat-tricks scored since 25th August 2015. This time around they came from players at Sunderland, Aston Villa, Swansea City. On that last occasion in 2015? Well, they were scored by Sunderland, Aston Villa and…Leicester City. We had you there, didn’t we? Arsenal picked up their first win in an actual stadium of 2021-22. This is including pre-season games against Hibernian, Celtic, Chelsea and Tottenham in addition to their Premier League defeats versus Brentford and Chelsea. They did beat both Watford (4-1) and Millwall (4-1) in friendlies at their London Colney training ground pitch, but I’m not counting that. This 6-0 victory over West Brom at the Hawthorns was their biggest away win in nearly 21 years, with a 6-0 win at QPR in the FA Cup back in January 2001 under Arsene Wenger the last occasion they won by such a large margin on the road. Following his treble last night, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is now on 88 competitive goals for Arsenal in his 150 appearances at the club. Only eight players in Arsenal history have scored more in their first 150 games, with the last to do so being Ian Wright in November 1994 (108 goals). Thierry Henry had managed eight goals fewer (80) at this point of his Gunners’ career. It was a much-needed confidence boost for Arteta’s outfit, but it must be said that it came against a West Brom side that made 11 changes from their Championship win away at Blackburn on Saturday and was effectively their second-string. Similar vibes…. Andre Tjay De Barr enjoyed a dream debut in English football on Tuesday night. The Gibraltar international joined this summer from Lincoln Red Imps and not only scored an equaliser in injury time to take Wycombe’s tie with Stevenage to penalties, but he went on to score the winning penalty in the shootout. The last Gibraltarian to score in the competition was David Artell in August 2012 for Northampton Town vs. Cardiff City, but to do this in your first game in England is probably more special. Screenwriters, if you’re reading this then I have an idea: Goal IV: One Night in Stevenage. Elsewhere, Christos Tzolis scored two goals in Norwich City’s 6-0 demolition of Bournemouth at Carrow Road. He was the first Greek player to score in the League Cup in nearly eight years, with Giorgos Karagounis the last in October 2013 for Fulham. Tzolis is still only 19 years old and signed for the Canaries this summer after having a hand in nine goals (five goals, four assists) in the Greek Super League for POAK last season – one to keep an eye on in 2021-22. – MF Following matchday two of the 2021-22 Premier League season, we’ve devised a quick 10 question quiz to test your knowledge. How much attention did you really pay to the action this weekend?  – MF David Moyes, top of the Premier League. Nine years after he struggled to replace the irreplaceable Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, Moyes’ spiritual comeback is complete. After guiding West Ham to sixth place last season the fear was that it would be hard to improve or even replicate that form a year on. And maybe that will turn out to be the case but after walloping FA Cup holders Leicester City 4-1 on Monday night anything seems possible. West Ham United, top of the Premier League. Two wins out of two for the first time in 24 years and eight goals in their opening pair of matches in a top-flight season since 1930-31. The fans in London Stadium haven’t always been happy, or confined to the stands. They are now. Michail Antonio, top of the Premier League and top of the all-time West Ham United Premier League goals chart. No man epitomises this team more. Since the start of last season Antonio has a non-penalty expected goals per 90 rate of 0.63, higher than any other player to record 500+ minutes of action. When the underlying numbers and the overlying numbers concur like this you know there will be a madness. And Antonio’s pair of goals were lashed home like a man who knows he is in the form of his life. A player who has spent considerable time in virtually every position on a football pitch is a one-man front three, and Leicester could not handle him at all. They won’t be the last team to suffer like this. In a league that always throws up sentimental stories, the turnaround in David Moyes’ career is particularly heartwarming. A crazed hybrid of every great manager in football history would have struggled in the job he took on at Old Trafford in 2013, but since the start of last season his West Ham side have the fifth highest points total in the division, with only two fewer than current European champions Chelsea. Now West Ham are looking down on every other football club in the country and you know they’ll enjoy every single moment. -DA 2 – West Ham ended the day top of the Premier League for only the second time ever, after also doing so on August 22nd, 2006. Summit. This weekend was the first with all top five European leagues in action in 2021-22 and we saw some fantastic displays across the board. We look at some of the standout performances from a statistical point of view from round of action, below. Trent-Alexander Arnold helped Liverpool to a solid 2-0 victory over Burnley at Anfield on Saturday, kicking off MD2 in the Premier League. The English full back assisted Sadio Mané’s goal to wrap up the victory in the 69th minute, with this being one of seven chances he created in the game – equalling his highest-ever tally in a Premier League match. His passes were more dangerous than they’ve ever been in an English top-flight game, with an expected assist total of 1.09 his best-ever in an appearance in the competition. He was a constant attacking threat, making six touches in the opposition box, a figure he’s only surpassed once in his Premier League career: versus Burnley back in January (11). Sean Dyche’s team should probably have known what to expect, but even then, could they have stopped him on this form? Chelsea defeated Arsenal 2-0 at the Emirates Stadium yesterday, with Romelu Lukaku being a standout performer – something we wrote about yesterday in this blog (scroll down this page). However, another constant thorn in the side of the Gunners was Reece James from right wing back. James posed his highest ever figures in a Premier League game for expected assists (0.8), shots (four) and touches in the opposition box (nine), with an assist for Lukaku’s opener and scoring the second goal himself. In addition to his four shots, the English international created four chances for his teammates, meaning he had a hand in over a third of Chelsea’s 22 shots in the match (36%). Despite joining RB Leipzig from energy drink brothers Salzburg in January, Dominik Szoboszlai wasn’t able to make his Bundesliga debut until last weekend at Mainz thanks to a long-term injury. This injury also ruled him out of Hungary’s Euro 2000 campaign, which was a huge shame considering he scored the goal to take them there. Only 20 years old, Szoboszlai really announced his arrival in his first Bundesliga start this weekend with a brace in Leipzig’s emphatic 4-0 win over Stuttgart. His first goal came on 38 minutes, with a brilliant strike from the angle of the box. His second goal came 14 minutes later, but Szoboszlai will have issues convincing people that he meant it. In addition to these goals, he created four chances for his teammates and misplaced just three of his 37 passes in a 68-minute appearance. We can’t wait to see more of this lad. In case you didn’t see the RB Leipzig goals on Sky Sports, because, well, you didn’t…Here they are, including Dominik Szoboszlai’s brilliant double:pic.twitter.com/4nkCENCtpR Andy Delort woke up on Sunday morning and decided to cause chaos. The Montpellier forward was at his best in their 3-1 Ligue 1 home win over Lorient, with an involvement in 13 of his side’s shots in the game – attempting eight himself and creating another five for his teammates. Only once before has Delort been involved in more shots during a Ligue 1 match. In April 2019, he attempted nine shots and created another five for his teammates against Strasbourg but ended that game without a goal or an assist, which must have been a real kick in the teeth. Since joining Montpellier from Toulouse in the summer of 2018, the striker has scored 40 goals in Ligue 1 – a figure only bettered by Kylian Mbappé (79), while he also ranks joint-fifth for assists (20).  A frustrating afternoon in front of goal was ended with his eighth and final shot of the match, scoring an uncontested header from a corner in the 83rd minute. It was what Delort deserved after a brilliant performance that helped Montpellier to their first Ligue 1 win of the season and meant that his xG total of exactly one was matched by his goal tally. – MF Arsenal have opened up a Premier League season with two defeats for just the third time in their history, after 1992-93 under George Graham and 2019-20 under Unai Emery. The opening-day defeat at newly promoted Brentford was unexpected, but it has to be said that this result was on the cards despite the Gunners great recent record against Chelsea. Mikel Arteta has now taken charge of 60 Premier League games at Arsenal since his debut as boss on Boxing Day 2019. With 94 points, they have the sixth-most in the competition since his arrival, but it’s the ever-reducing gap between themselves and the teams not considered as ‘big six’ that’ll be the most alarming. Should Leicester City beat West Ham tomorrow night, they’d leapfrog the Gunners’ 94 points in this period and Everton are only a point behind with 93. In the 60 games preceding Arteta’s arrival, Arsenal won five points more (99), this despite it containing five games under Freddie Ljungberg and four at the tail-end of Arsène Wenger’s reign to add to the 51 under Unai Emery that were deemed not good enough for him to stay in London. It doesn’t get any easier for Arsenal, as their next Premier League game sees them make the trip to reigning champions Manchester City. They haven’t lost their first three games to a league season since 1954-55, but the odds are stacked against them avoiding this feat again for the first time in 66 years. 0 – In what is their 118th campaign in England’s top four tiers, Arsenal have opened a league season with two defeats and no goals after two matches for the first time in their history. Damaged. pic.twitter.com/mlXMGzPLvt – MF Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea march on. This London derby win over Arsenal ended a three-game losing streak against the Gunners in all competitions, but this display was a show of dominance from the Blues. Since taking charge of Chelsea on Jan. 26, 2021, Tuchel’s picked up 44 points in 21 games (2.10 per game), with only Manchester City winning more (51) with an extra game played. One of the major criticisms of Chelsea in 2020-21 was their poor finishing in front of goal, as they underperformed their xG total by 4.9 last season – the fifth worst in the competition. There looks to be little chance of this occurring again this campaign following the signing of Romelu Lukaku. Lukaku put in an awesome display at the Emirates Stadium, here. His 15th-minute strike meant that he scored his 114th Premier League goal, overtaking Ian Wright to become the competition’s 20th-highest scoring player. Lukaku has also become the eighth non-Englishman to score 50+ goals both home and away in the competition. 1 – Romelu Lukaku has scored his first goal for Chelsea in his 16th appearance for the club, nine years and 360 days after initially making his debut for the Blues in August 2011. Awaited. pic.twitter.com/mFEHujR2Fh Including the end of his Internazionale career, Lukaku’s now scored in four successive league appearances and has been involved in 21 goals in his last 19 games in league competition (13 goals, 8 assists). In this match, Lukaku was at his best as a complete centre forward, and a fantastic Bernd Leno save in the 77th minute was all that kept him from a brace. He attempted eight shots and created chances on three more occasions – only once before has the Belgian been involved in 11+ of his sides’ shots in a Premier League match, for Everton versus West Ham in May 2015. If he performs like this regularly this season, then opposition defences ought to be very concerned. – MF It’s now 27 games in row without defeat for Manchester United in Premier League away games, but yet again they kept this unbeaten run intact by doing it the hard way. For the 13th time during this 27-game run, United came from behind to rescue at least a point. Overall, since the run began in February 2020, they have picked up 31 points from losing positions in away games, winning nine and drawing four after falling behind to their hosts. Mason Greenwood was United’s goalscorer in the 1-1 draw at Southampton today, with his strike being his 19th in the Premier League. With those 19 goals, Greenwood equalled Nicolas Anelka’s Premier League goal tally as a teenager and now only Michael Owen (40), Robbie Fowler (35), Wayne Rooney (30) have scored more in their teenage years in the competition than United’s young star. With Greenwood now just over five weeks away from his 20th birthday, it’s unlikely he’ll climb the rankings for this statistic any further, but there’s adequate time to improve this goal tally nonetheless. Paul Pogba assisted Greenwood’s goal, meaning that he’s already got five assists in the Premier League this season. No player has ever assisted as many as five goals in their side’s opening two games of a Premier League season before Pogba did it in the 55th minute of this match. 2020-21 saw Pogba only assist three goals in 1896 minutes of league action, but it must be said that the finishing on his passes has been exceptional – Pogba’s expected assists total is just 0.68 this season, so the five assists he does have could be deemed slightly flattering. Still, at 0.37 xA per 90, 2021-22 is proving to be his most creative season yet and nearly five times as dangerous to opposition teams as last season (0.08 per 90). – MF Hugo Lloris made his 300th Premier League appearance in Spurs’ win over Wolves at Molineux Stadium this afternoon, moving him top of their all-time appearance ranking in the competition. The Frenchman overtook Darren Anderton’s 299 appearances for Tottenham in this match and kept a clean sheet for good measure. A clean sheet in this match took Lloris’ total to 106 overall in the Premier League – only seven goalkeepers have kept more by their 300th appearance in the competition, with Petr Cech leading the way with 145. The Spurs goalkeeper’s clean sheet total is one more than Manchester United’s David de Gea kept in his first 300 Premier League appearances (105). In reaching 300, Lloris became just the eighth goalkeeper to hit that milestone for a single club in the competition. He’s still some way off the record held by Jussi Jääskeläinen at Bolton Wanderers (379) but will only have to hang around in north London for another two years to get close to the Finn’s tally. His performances in recent seasons in particular have been most impressive for Spurs, with Lloris proving himself to be one of the best shot-stoppers in the English top-flight. Since the start of the 2019-20 season, Spurs’ number one has prevented 16 goals based on the quality of shots on target that he’s faced (expected goals on target); more than any other goalkeeper in the competition. – MF There’s a morose school of thought that suggests that looking at the league table early on in the season is a pointless exercise. Well say that to Brighton and Brentford fans who will wake up on Sunday morning with their clubs in second and fourth place respectively. A lot of people got their first look at 2021-22 Brighton on Saturday evening as they calmly despatched Watford at home to make it two wins out of two. Sounds routine, but remember that last season it took until January 31 before Brighton took three points on their own turf. This is quiet progress, but important nonetheless. Sometimes last season it seemed that Brighton were less a football club than an art project designed to teach people about expected goals. Creative but wasteful going forwards, tight but unlucky at the back, Brighton should have been dreaming of the Europa League but instead had to spend months fighting a relegation battle. It wasn’t fair, it wasn’t right, but at least we can now quantify these emotions. Had Albion sacked manager Graham Potter at any point it would have been an unpopular decision both inside and outside the club. But there was no need to, an improvement in results was always in the post. And here we are.  2 – Neal Maupay, who has scored his 20th Premier League goal, has scored in both of Brighton's first two league games of 2021-22, this after having only scored in two of his final 18 league appearances last season. Revitalised. #BHAWAT pic.twitter.com/6K1bQxBbJN A team who spurned opportunities has become – relatively – clinical and although shot conversion rate is a metric older than quite a few current Premier League players, it tells an important story here. Brighton last season scored with 8.2% of their shots, but in their opening two matches of 2021-22 this has climbed considerably to 14.8%. Historically these numbers are not dissimilar to the improvement/progression that Liverpool showed from the Kenny Dalglish season in 2011-12 through to the Brendan Rodgers-led title charge two years later. That’s not to directly compare the teams – Brighton do not have a finisher anywhere near the level of a 2013 Luis Suarez – but it does demonstrate that becoming more clinical can change the entire energy a football club projects. Brighton are not going to finish in the top two this season, and they are not going to finish in the top four either, but a top half finish is well within their grasp. After a year of saying things like “actually if you look at the underlying numbers Brighton should be in eighth place”, maybe we can finally use the league table to judge Graham Potter’s side.   -DA Liverpool are top of the Premier League – for a few hours at least – after a comfortable 2-0 home win against Burnley. It was almost as if the odd, pandemic-hit Premier League of 2020-21 was just a bad dream as Virgil van Dijk commanded his side at the back, allowing full-backs Konstantinos Tsimikas and Trent Alexander-Arnold to attack at will. Just like in the good old days of the late 2010s. Tsimikas assisted Liverpool’s first goal with a cross that was delightfully angled in by Diogo Jota’s head, while Alexander-Arnold, popping up as an inside-right, clipped the ball around the corner to Sadio Mane who rattled, and I must emphasise the word rattled, the ball into the back of the net. It was Trent’s 34th Premier League assist, which drew him level with such icons as Steve Guppy and Joey Barton, as well as the two slightly more famous names mentioned in the tweet below. Trent Alexander-Arnold now has as many PL assists as Cristiano Ronaldo & Harry Kane After a tough 2020-21 which saw him assist ‘only’ seven goals, this was the Alexander-Arnold of previous seasons, casually turning in the sort of display that carried Liverpool to the Champions League final for two seasons in succession and then to a league title. During lockdown we heard about some players who, secretly or otherwise, almost preferred the reduction of pressure when playing in front of empty stands. We certainly saw numerous elements of football altered by the pandemic. But equally there are players who thrive in the much-missed hubbub of a real, full, football stadium. Is Trent Alexander-Arnold one of those? It certainly seems like it. Another Liverpool player who thrives in front of the Anfield crowd is Virgil van Dijk. No Liverpool fan has ever seen van Dijk lose a Premier League game at Anfield in Liverpool colours. It simply hasn’t happened. Today’s game against Burnley was the 48th Premier League home game the Dutchman has played for Liverpool and he is yet to lose. Without him last season, the club ended up losing six in a row there for the first time in their history. Only one man, Manchester United’s Lee Sharpe, has ever played more Premier League home games for a club without suffering defeat. Sharpe was a winger who ended up playing as a full-back. Liverpool, in contrast, have turned their full-backs into winger-level production units. The story is old but it goes on. –DA We didn’t see a single draw on matchday one of the 2021-22 Premier League season – it couldn’t happen again, could it? Last season’s English top-flight didn’t see a draw until MD3, and even then, there were only two across those three days of Premier League action. Overall, the first 38 games of 2020-21 produced just three draws overall – all of those being score draws. Week two of this season’s action kicks off with Liverpool hosting Burnley at Anfield. Ashley Barnes’ late penalty sealed a shock win there for the Lancashire side last season, but our match predictor gives Liverpool the second-highest chance of a victory across the entire league this weekend (66%). The only team with a higher chance of victory on MD2 is judged to be Manchester City (87.4%), as they host a newly-promoted Norwich City side that have lost 11 successive matches in the top-flight – not the kindest place to visit when you’re on such a run. Watford started the season with a great 3-2 home win over Aston Villa last weekend, and of all the matches to be played today, the Hornets are given the best chance of an away win by our match predictor (30.8%). Brighton won just four of their 19 Premier League home games in 2020-21 but did lose the same number of matches at home as Manchester United and Liverpool (6) so the 29.5% chance of a draw given in the predictions might play out. Can Brentford pick up yet another London derby victory following an impressive win over Arsenal on MD1?  Our match predictions suggest they’ve got a 27.9% chance of doing just that, but Palace will be looking to pick up their first points of the season in what is Patrick Vieira’s first home game as boss in the competition. As a player, the Frenchman only ever lost 15 of his 157 home games in the Premier League (9.6%) – can he transfer that great record across to his managerial career in the English top-flight? – MF When Florentino Pérez warned the world that football would be dead in three years if his Super League project had not gone ahead, he was probably referring to his model, his way to run a club, the same shared by the rest of the “Super Clubs”. But a different approach to running clubs is indeed possible. One that is founded on the legacy fan rather than solely catering to the new breed of digital fans. Without the ability to spend millions on new players, it’s a model based on self-sustainability and investment in the youth system. Enter Athletic Club, commonly known as Athletic Bilbao. Athletic are more than a football team, they’re a philosophy, a way of life. In a football world where globalization is the norm and success is the only acceptable currency, a club comprised only of local talent and who’s last league title (and national cup) was in 1984, struggles to capture much of the limelight.   The incredible part of the story is that Athletic fans are not that fussed by the lack of trophies. Rather, they deem their tradition of only recruitment Basque players as more important than any cup or silverware. They most important currency in Bilbao is pride. First of all, Los Leones are one of only three clubs that have never been relegated from the Spanish top flight. At the same time they are one of the most successful teams in Spanish history, third in terms of overall trophies or fourth when filtering by league titles (two fewer than Atlético Madrid but 13 more Copa del Rey trophies). Their last trophy remains the Spanish Super Cup which they won last January in Seville in injury time against Barcelona. But it’s the national cup that keeps eluding them. Since 1984, they have lost in six finals, including twice in the same week (the 2019-20 and 2020-21 editions). Despite the lack of success, the club is famous all around the world for their Basque-only policy. It’s estimated that just over 3m people live in the Basque Country, including both the Spanish and the French regions. And even if the rules of inclusion have recently expanded to include people from non-Basque origin who have grown up there locally or kids living elsewhere but who come from Basque families, we are still talking of a catchment area of fewer than 3.5m people. When looking at adding players to their squad, the club have two different problems: Let’s look at the list of their main signings in the transfer market in the last 15 years. This means the only way to survive is self-sustainment via investment in a youth policy that nurtures the best talent in the local area and in the Basque world internationally. Lezama, Athletic Bilbao’s academy and training centre, is one of the most famous “canteras” – a term used in Spain to refer to youth academies and farm teams organized by sports clubs – in the world. Just looking at the last 15 years again, the club have been able to field players who have come through their ranks each and every season: Many of them have featured in the senior team for quite some time as we can see from the list of the ones with 100+ appearances: A youngster coming through the ranks at Lezama knows if they are good enough, they have a good chance to make it to the top. Not all the good players decide to stay for the whole careers. Most of them end up playing for other clubs, at home and abroad, but the Athletic example shows another model is possible if you put pride and identity before trophies. -SF (additional research support from Vanessa Marina)",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2021/08/the-data-day-no-4-our-rolling-football-blog/,Duncan Alexander,26/08/2021 4:00,the-analyst
5739,Bayern Munich star Muller says goodbye to Lewandowski with Michael Jordan meme,"Bayern Munich ace Thomas Muller compared his partnership on the pitch with Robert Lewandowski with the great Chicago Bulls NBA duo of Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. Muller and Lewandowski have starred for Bayern for the entirety of the Poland striker's eight-year spell in Bavaria, combining for 19 major trophies, including eight consecutive Bundesliga titles and the 2019-20 Champions League.  Now Lewandowski is departing Bayern for Barcelona in a move worth €45 million (£38m/$45m), and his long-time partner sent him on his way with a heartfelt farewell message which included a mention of the Bulls legends.  On Saturday following the announcement of Lewandowski's exit Muller took to Instagram to pay tribute to his outgoing team-mate.  The message was accompanied by a series of pictures of the pair together, including one of Jordan and Pippen with their heads replaced by those of the Bayern men.  Lewandowski wears Jordan's iconic No.23 jersey while Muller gave himself the No.33 - acknowledging his role in supporting the striker who has smashed goalscoring records left, right and centre in recent seasons. ""All the best for your future!"" Muller wrote alongside the montage. ""Eight special years, a lot of goals a lot of trophies, ups and downs but always respect and a real winning spirit!!"" As well as Muller, senior figures in the Bayern set-up also paid tribute to Lewandowski following confirmation of his transfer.  ""It's good for both sides that we have clarity. Robert has earned our appreciation, he has won everything with us. We are incredibly grateful to him,"" club president Herbert Hainer affirmed in quotes published on Bayern's official website. Sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic added: ""Robert Lewandowski has done great things for FC Bayern. We spoke at length with our colleagues from Barcelona and clarified the details. He said farewell this morning.  ""After our trip to the USA, he'll come back one more time and we'll have a coffee together. We wish him every success at his new club.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bayern-munich-star-muller-says-goodbye-to-lewandowski-with/blt6203e6494e2b3274,Daniel Edwards,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10625,Seven Knee-Jerk Reactions to the Premier League Weekend,"We are back with our latest round of knee-jerk reactions, this time looking at Matchday 5 of the Premier League season. Whoever said small sample sizes are a bad thing? (It might have been us.) Since leaving Brighton for Arsenal in the January transfer window earlier this year, just five Arsenal players have made more appearances for the club than Leandro Trossard. The Belgian is clearly a big part of Mikel Arteta’s plans. The problem though, for Trossard at least, is the extent to which he has struggled to break into Arteta’s first team. No Arsenal player has made more than Trossard’s 12 substitute appearances since he joined the club, and 10 other players have played more minutes than him since he arrived at the Emirates. The former Brighton man must be wondering what more he can do to convince Arteta he is worthy of a starting berth. His winner for Arsenal against Everton on Sunday – a game in which he came off the bench (surprise) – was admittedly just his second goal for the club, but when you factor in his 10 assists, just two players (Bukayo Saka with 17 and Gabriel Martinelli with 13) have managed more than his 12 goal involvements since joining the club. That’s made all the more impressive given his lack of regular first-team minutes. In fact, at a rate of a goal or assist every 88 minutes, no one has contributed more frequently to Arsenal’s attack than Trossard since his debut. Martinelli had to be substituted with a muscle injury in the first half against Everton, and if he has a period on the sidelines it might finally give the Trossard the chance to force his way into Arsenal’s best XI. He certainly deserves that chance. Another week, another loss for Luton. They’re only four games in so it isn’t quite time to panic yet, but the number of people using the words ‘Luton Town’ and ‘Derby County’ in the same sentence is cause for concern in itself. Derby of course hold the record for the lowest ever points total in a Premier League season, earning just 11 points in 2007-08, and Rob Edwards’ side, having so far given us very little reason to believe they can survive, need to show some signs of improvement soon if mentions of Paul Jewell’s terrible side are to stop. After defeat to Fulham at the weekend, Luton are the only team yet to pick up a single point from their four games so far this season. They are the top flight’s lowest scorers having scored just two goals, also attempting the fewest shots on target (7). At the other end, their 10 goals conceded is the third worst in the division. There was some hope at Craven Cottage in that they created a few decent chances, and their xG of 4.48 so far this season suggests that with some better finishing they might fare a little better. The only problem is there isn’t much sign that they have anyone capable of finishing off their chances. Seven shots on target from chances worth 4.5 xG is a really poor return; Sheffield United have scored five goals from just 3.5 xG. There is a long, long way to go, but four defeats from four games means Luton are getting into the territory of challenging Crystal Palace’s Premier League record for the worst start to a Premier League season, when they lost their first seven games in 2017-18 under Frank de Boer (though they eventually survived comfortably thanks to a rescue act from Roy Hodgson). Luton have crunch games against Wolves, Everton and Burnley up next. One point from those would mean they avoid equalling Palace’s record, but they need more than that to get their survival bid up and running. It’s a phrase that was coined by Jürgen Klopp about a previous incarnation of his team, but this new-look Liverpool – one that many people assumed would need time to gel after a summer of upheaval – looks to have the makings of another bunch of ‘mentality monsters’. Saturday’s comeback win at Wolves means Liverpool have already won nine points from losing positions from five Premier League games this season. After coming back to beat Bournemouth and Newcastle, goals from Cody Gakpo and Andy Robertson turned the game at Molineux on its head before an own from Hugo Bueno put the icing on the cake. To put their comeback achievements into perspective, no team in Europe’s top five leagues has won more points this season from losing positions this season than Liverpool, while six Premier League teams failed to win more than nine points after going behind in the entirety of 2022-23. Klopp is a master of building team spirit and belief, and the team he built that produced a bunch of famous Champions League comebacks en route to glory in 2019 and then went on to win the Premier League were a legendary team in that regard. His current team are nowhere near that level, but they have the potential and mentality to beat anyone the way they are playing – even if they go behind first. Callum Wilson just continues to deliver. His game-winning penalty against Brentford at the weekend took Wilson to three Premier League goals this season, making him Newcastle’s outright top scorer. The Englishman has been remarkably consistent. Since the start of last season just two players – the peerless Erling Haaland (43) and the now-departed Harry Kane (30) – have scored more Premier League goals than Wilson’s 21. Alexander Isak, who arrived to much fanfare over the summer in 2022, only has 12 goals over that timeframe. Admittedly, the Swede has had his fair share of injuries, but the underlying data really does point to Wilson being Newcastle’s most dangerous striker, as well as one of the most potent in the league. His underlying expected goals (xG) numbers are exceptional. This season, only Haaland (1.47) can better Wilson’s xG per 90 tally of 1.18 (minimum 90 minutes played). If we extend that timeframe to 2023 as a whole, then the pair of them are essentially tied – Haaland has 1.0 xG per 90 compared to Wilson’s 0.99 – and Wilson’s non-penalty xG per 90 of 0.82 is not only better than Haaland’s (0.79) but greater than anyone else in the division. Not only that, but Wilson also has the best minutes per goal of any Premier League player in 2023, finding the net on average once every 83 minutes. The numbers Wilson has put up have been too consistent over too long a period of time to be considered a fluke. Let’s face it, Wilson is the (second) best striker in the league. Between them, Enzo Fernández, Declan Rice and Moisés Caicedo make up three of the top five most expensive midfielders of all time. All of them moved for eye-watering sums of money in 2023, and Aston Villa midfielder Douglas Luiz could be the next on that list. Perhaps rather tellingly, it was Manchester City who brought the Brazilian to England, plucking him from Vasco de Gama in Brazil’s top flight in 2017. Yet Luiz never made an appearance for City and instead spent time on loan at La Liga side Girona. Aston Villa then pounced, acquiring his services in 2019, and Luiz has been a mainstay in the heart of midfield ever since. Since joining the club, no player has made more league appearances than Luiz’s 145. Off the ball, he’s Aston Villa’s primary ball winner in midfield. No Villa player has made as many tackles (8) or at a better success rate (72.8%) than Luiz, while he’s won back possession for his side more often (7.4 times per 90) than any other teammate. He was a colossus in midfield at the weekend against Crystal Palace, winning possession 16 times, the most by a player in a single Premier League match in 2023-24 so far. Douglas Luiz won possession 16 times against Crystal Palace yesterday – the most by a player in a single Premier League match in 2023-24 so far.#avfc @AVFCOfficial pic.twitter.com/ZMLK8LSvBs Once he’s won the ball back for Villa, Luiz has the ability in possession to launch attacks for his side. The midfielder has started seven attacking sequences that have ended in an Aston Villa shot, more than any other player, while only two teammates – the far more attack-minded duo of Ollie Watkins and Moussa Diaby – have been involved in more overall attacking sequences ending in a shot. With the Brazilian averaging 81 touches per 90 minutes – the most in the Villa squad – and 4.5 progressive passes per 90 – the most of any regular midfielder – his ability on the ball could well translate to a bigger club who enjoy even more possession than Unai Emery’s outfit. It’s not just this season that Luiz has impressed. In 2022-23, he was voted both Supporter’s Player of the Season and Player’s Player of the Season at Aston Villa’s end-of-season awards. Arsenal were reportedly interested in acquiring Luiz ahead of the 2022-23 campaign. They’ve now found their solution in Rice, but don’t be surprised to see more top clubs circling around the Brazilian before too long. Nottingham Forest have bought so many players in the last few years that it shouldn’t be that surprising that they have managed to put together a top-class front four, but after adding Callum Hudson-Odoi on transfer deadline day, they now have genuinely exciting group of attacking players. An underwhelming year on loan at Bayer Leverkusen has meant Hudson-Odoi’s move to Forest could have been viewed as make or break. The signs from his debut on Monday night against Burnley were positive, though, with a wonderful, curled equaliser from the edge of the box and his overall performance suggesting he is still very much the player we saw in his early Chelsea days. Adding Hudson-Odoi to a Forest attack already boasting Anthony Elanga, Morgan Gibbs-White and Taiwo Awoniyi – whose assist for Hudson-Odoi meant he has now directly contributed to a goal in nine consecutive Premier League games – means Steve Cooper now has a front four that could pose a threat to any opponent. Forest are eighth in the table, and in tough games against Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United, they showed they are a very dangerous side when they play on the break. They had more of the ball against Burnley on Monday and struggled to create as many chances as their possession might have allowed them, but with time this new front four should help them learn to break opponents down in other ways. They now have the quality in attack to improve on last season’s 16th-place finish. Part of Sky Sports’ analysis of Arsenal’s win at Everton on Sunday focused on the time it took for Bukayo Saka to take the corner which led to Trossard’s winning goal. He took 26 seconds from placing the ball to playing it short to Martin Ødegaard – a duration Gary Neville described as “an absolute mountain of time.” It took Arsenal 26-seconds to take their corner before Trossard's goal…👀⏱️ pic.twitter.com/nNZ5UjisHm Given it was still goalless at the time and Arsenal were just over 20 minutes away from dropping points to a struggling Everton side that had only avoided defeat once all season, they clearly weren’t wasting time. In fact, as Sky’s analysts pointed out, it looked as though Saka was just trying to slow things down so much that Everton’s players were all static in the penalty areas before he took the corner and Arsenal burst into life. A few seconds later Trossard had put Arsenal ahead. A smart ploy, clearly. But Saka’s slowing down of the game didn’t really deserve such close analysis. Opta have calculated the time between the ball going out and a corner being taken on Premier League games for years now. There were nine seconds between the ball going out of play and Saka placing the ball, making a total of 35 seconds between the ball going out and the corner being taken. The average time that it took – from the ball going out of play – for corners to be taking last season was 33 seconds. So, Saka’s delay was just two seconds above last season’s average. Sometimes snap judgements – what some people might call knee-jerk reactions – aren’t a very good idea after all. Enjoy this?

1745,"Frank responds to rumours of Brentford signing Eriksen: If they fit the criteria of no d*ckheads, they can play for us","Brentford boss Thomas Frank is flattered to see his club linked with Christian Eriksen, while affirming that the Denmark international meets his ""no d*ckhead"" recruitment rule.  Eriksen is currently a free agent after leaving Inter in 2021 due to Serie A rules banning players taking the field with a cardioverter-defibrillator.  He would face no such impediment in the Premier League, leading to reports that the ex-Tottenham star is keen on a return to England.  “This is a player that only plays for the top clubs,” Frank told reporters on Tuesday when asked about the prospect of signing Eriksen. “Something unfortunate happened to Christian and now things changed a bit. He deserves to play at the highest level and I hope he will. “Under normal circumstances there would be no rumours with a club like us. I guess we should be flattered that there are rumours with a player of his qualities. “It’s the same with all players out there – (Lionel) Messi, (Kylian) Mbappe, Eriksen. If they fit the criteria of no d***heads, they can play for us.” Frank knows Eriksen better than most, having taken the playmaker under his wing as a teenager while in charge of Denmark’s under-17 team. And while he has had little contact with the star since his collapse during Euro 2020, he is backing his former protege to make it back for club and country.  “Of course I spoke to him after the incident, but that’s a while ago, not since. It was in the autumn,"" he added. “I really hope he comes back to top football again, that is what he wants. Recently in a Danish programme he said his big aim was to play in the World Cup, I really hope he succeeds, I can’t see why he shouldn’t. “For all Danish fans he was the biggest star before the Euros and, if he gets up to speed, he will be the biggest star again. We all want the best for him and his family.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/frank-responds-to-rumours-of-brentford-signing-eriksen-if/blt84d546aa8c5007d1,Daniel Edwards,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5867,"Mbappe's PSG stay 'an insult to football', fumes La Liga president Tebas","La Liga president Javier Tebas says Paris Saint-Germain's alleged financial offer to keep Kylian Mbappe at the club and halt his move to Real Madrid is ""an insult to football"". The France international looks set to sensationally stay with the Ligue 1 champions, mere days after reportedly agreeing terms with Los Blancos, after the Parc des Princes outfit swayed him to remain. But Tebas has been left outraged by the decision, and has fired a broadside at PSG club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi over his conduct throughout the affair. As reports gathered pace on Saturday that Mbappe would snub a move to La Liga, Tebas launched an attack on PSG for their alleged financial offer, saying they represented a threat like the failed Super League - despite suggestions Madrid, an architect of the proposed breakaway division, would pay the forward a similar amount. ""What PSG are doing by renewing with Mbappe for a huge amount of money (who knows where and how it'll be paid) after announcing losses of 700M in the last few seasons and having a wage burden of 600M is an INSULT to football,"" he claimed on Twitter. ""Al-Khelafi (sic) is as dangerous as the Super League,"" he further fumed. For Tebas, there may well be a touch of egg on his face, with the president having previously suggested that it was a done deal for Mbappe to make the move to La Liga and bring superstar attention back after Lionel Messi's exit to PSG. Now, with Erling Haaland having headed to Manchester City, the league arguably faces another campaign without a clear-cut marquee man, even if Karim Benzema is a leading Ballon d'Or candidate. ""I think [Mbappe] will be at Real Madrid, but since one day he is white, another black, he changes,"" Tebas previously stated. ""But I think so. We wouldn't have good news, but it wouldn't be bad news.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mbappe-s-psg-stay-an-insult-to-football-fumes-la-liga/blt18cd0e8635c6f953,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7322,The beginning of the end? PSG claim 10th Ligue 1 title amid acrimony and uncertainty,"Paris Saint-Germain’s record-equalling 10th league title should have been the cause of much jubilation in Parc des Princes but instead it was simply reason for much soul searching. The 16-point advantage that PSG boast over second-placed Marseille does not reflect their struggles in many matches this season, and it was in some ways fitting that the already flat party was dampened further by a late Lens equaliser, with the in-form visitors escaping with a 1-1 draw on the night. PSG’s ultras, meanwhile, chose to celebrate the success outside the capital’s famous old ground, still in dispute with the club over the manner of their latest Champions League exit to Real Madrid, which has cast such a cloud over the Ligue 1 side for the last month. The fans in the ground exited come full-time with little celebration or fuss, with a pocket of Lens supporters, who were meant to be banned from travelling, the group making the noise. Such has been the strange nature of PSG’s season and the uncertainty over what lies ahead for the club. This title feels like a crossroads in the history of Les Parisiens, with perhaps the most important summer ever in the team’s history looming. The Galactico project of a year ago has quite obviously failed. Lionel Messi’s difficulties might have been overplayed, but he has not produced the magic expected of him, instead offering a tantalising glimpse of his very best form with a stunning opening goal against Lens. It was just his fourth of the season in the league. Sergio Ramos, meanwhile, has barely played, Achraf Hakimi has lost momentum after a bright start and the less said about Georginio Wijnaldum the better. Quite where PSG turn next is dependent on the future of their Qatari owners. There have been rumours that they are getting ready to wind down their participation at the club once the World Cup is over in December. They have moved to strenuously deny these claims. There will be clues in their intentions judging by their summer actions. Of course, the priority lies with retaining the services of Kylian Mbappe. The World Cup winner has become PSG’s figurehead player over the past 12 months, emerging as their most consistent and outstanding talent in a season in which he has often been required to unlock opposing defences almost single-handedly at times, such has been the lack of team cohesion. Out of contract at the end of June, rumours over a free departure to Real Madrid in the summer continue, although PSG remain optimistic that Mbappe will remain in France, largely thanks to the huge wages they are capable of offering him over the course of a new one or two-year deal. The outcome of these talks is likely to shape the future. Where PSG will turn without Mbappe is unclear. Neymar, who signed a bumper new deal last year, has shown little sign of getting close to his best form over the most difficult season of his career and made a point of reminding the supporters who booed him on Saturday that he has three more years in the French capital, while Messi will be 35 when the 2022-23 season begins. The squad needs to be gutted out. PSG are saddled with a number of well-paid fringe players who have little motivation to leave. Mauro Icardi is the most obvious example, but they are also burdened with a dramatic excess of central midfielders. Moving these players on promises to be a challenge, particularly since sporting director Leonardo has the reputation of being a poor salesman. Indeed, even the Brazilian’s job is not safe, with the club’s poor transfer policy over several years finally coming under the type of scrutiny that should have come about sooner. Going into the summer, there is a sense that anything could happen at PSG and that the dream of winning the Champions League is more distant than ever before. Perhaps this was the beginning of the end.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/the-beginning-of-the-end-psg-claim-10th-ligue-1-title-amid/blta5512774eb1f7c2e,Robin Bairner,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
3652,'I could have secured my family for generations!' - Gosens reveals he rejected big-money transfer to Newcastle in January,"Robin Gosens has revealed that he rejected a big-money transfer to Newcastle in January, despite claiming that he ""could probably have secured a few more generations of my family with this money."" Gosens enjoyed a stellar 2020-21 campaign with Atalanta that earned him a spot in Germany's Euro 2020 squad, and he also impressed during that tournament despite his country's disappointing last-16 exit. The 27-year-old began attracting plenty of transfer interest as a result, and eventually opted to join Inter in January, with the Serie A champions securing an initial loan deal with an obligation to buy for €25 million (£21m/$28m). Prior to the move, GOAL reported that Newcastle had also identified Gosens as a target, but his preference was always to head to San Siro. The talented left-back has now confirmed that he had a lucrative package waiting for him at St James' Park, telling Kicker: ""I had a contract offer, but I rejected it. I would have jeopardised my sporting goals."" Gosens did, however, admit that he was greatly tempted by Newcastle's offer given the potential long-term financial benefits. ""I think it's very human to think about it,"" he added. ""If you can earn many times more for the same job at a different club, show me someone who just says 'No, thank you'.  ""It's not just about me, I could probably have secured a few more generations of my family with this money."" Newcastle may have missed out on Gosens, but they were still able to bring in a number of new recruits before the passing of the winter transfer deadline. The Magpies spent over £90 million ($122m) on Kieran Trippier, Chris Wood, Bruno Guimaraes and Dan Burn, showing off their financial power following the completion of their Saudi-backed takeover last October. Head coach Eddie Howe also welcomed Matt Targett to the club on loan from Aston Villa, with Newcastle now in far better shape to achieve their goal of avoiding relegation from the Premier League.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/gosens-reveals-rejected-big-money-transfer-newcastle-january/bltb3c8d940135e2649,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2852,Poland banish defender Rybus from World Cup 2022 plans after his transfer to Russian club Spartak Moscow,"Poland left-back Maciej Rybus has been informed he will be omitted from national team coach Czeslaw Michniewicz's plans for the Qatar 2022 World Cup after his summer move from Lokomotiv to Spartak Moscow. The 66-cap veteran, who was a member of his country's 2018 World Cup and Euro 2020 squads, decided to remain in Russia's first division despite the nation's ongoing military invasion of Ukraine. His choice has now cost him a spot on the plane to the end-of-year tournament, where his country will face Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Argentina in Group C. While Michniewicz is yet to give an official comment on the matter, the Polish Football Association confirmed the manager's decision to leave the left-back home in November. ""The coach of the Polish national team, Czeslaw Michniewicz, talked to Maciej Rybus, who was currently staying in Poland, after the training camp of the national team ended last week,"" read an official statement. ""The coach informed the player that, due to his current club situation, he would not be called up for the September training camp of the national team and would not take into account the team that would go to the World Cup in Qatar when determining the composition of the team."" So far, Rybus is the only player who looks to have been definitively banned by a national team headed to the tournament over their decision to remain involved in Russian football - but he may not be the last to face such action. Poland's move could well have a trickle-down effect on other international sides poised for Qatar 2022, who may opt to issue ultimatums to players over their future on the world stage if they were to sign a contract to play for a Russian outfit.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/poland-rybus-from-world-cup-2022-transfer/blt8586d68bf63c6286,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5183,Chelsea thrashed at Elland Road! Leeds put Blues to the sword as Koulibaly sees red,"WHAT HAPPENED? Leeds took control in four first-half minutes as Brenden Aaronson punished Edouard Mendy for taking too long on the ball before Rodrigo nodded home from a freekick. Jack Harrison added a third in the second half as Leeds stood strong and denied Chelsea any real opportunities. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Chelsea now have just four points from their opening three games, whilst Leeds have risen to second position in the table following an electric start to the season. The Whites are one of only five teams to have won two of their first three fixtures this season. ALL EYES ON: After his home debut last week, Chelsea fans would have been hoping for a bit more from Kalidou Koulibaly. Instead, the defender had a nightmare showing that saw him pick up a yellow after being turned by Brenden Aaronson in the first half which turned into a red late on as he was booked for another reckless challenge. One to forget for the Senegal international... THE MATCH IN THREE PHOTOS:    DID YOU KNOW? It was the first time that under Thomas Tuchel that Chelsea had gone in 2-0 down at half time. Chelsea have never won after being 2-0 down at half-time in the Premier League (D-3, L-43) WHAT'S THE VIBE? Leeds narrowly avoided relegation last season, but have now picked up seven points from their opening three games. An incredible turnaround! What a difference a full pre-season under Jesse Marsch has made at #LUFC. Unrecognisable from the Leeds side #CFC comfortably beat in May. Kai Havertz had a brutal match - but is this too harsh? I don’t think there’s a single Premier League player whose reputation has been influenced more by one game than Kai Havertz. Take away the Champions League Final, has he really been that much better than Werner/Pulisic/Ziyech? I’m not so sure. Surely not. Right? Only one man can save Chelsea…. pic.twitter.com/iD2w6VqVLf Still Chelsea have may need to look to the transfer market again to shore up their defence. Chelsea have had some luck in playing an extremely weak Everton on the opening day and against a better team this could have been the outcome then. They massively raised their game against Tottenham, but have dipped back down in a hostile away atmosphere against a lesser team. WHAT NEXT FOR CHELSEA?

3034,Man Utd change Aeroflot flight to Madrid for Champions League last-16 tie vs Atletico amid ongoing Ukraine-Russia tension,"Manchester United cancelled their flight with Aeroflot to Spain for their Champions League last-16 tie against Atletico Madrid amid the ongoing political tension between Ukraine and Russia. United are set to face Atletico in the first leg of the European knockout stage tie at Wanda Metropolitano on Wednesday night. Ralf Rangnick and his squad were originally due to travel to Madrid with Russia airline Aeroflot but changed their plans at the last minute. United have had a commercial partnership with Aeroflot since 2013 and have regularly used the charter airline to fly to European matches. They were pencilled in for flight A359 to Madrid scheduled to depart at 4pm GMT (11am ET) on Tuesday, but cancelled and travelled with British airline Titan Airways instead. It has been reported that the decision was made mutually with Aeroflot and United's relationship with the airline has not been affected. Russian President Vladimir Putin moved troops into two rebel-held regions of Ukraine on Tuesday. Putin declared Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson subsequently announced a number of sanctions against Russia. United opted against flying with a Russian airline due to the situation and UEFA is now under pressure to move the Champions League final from St Petersburg.

7745,15-year-old La Masia sensation backed to make Barcelona forget about Bergvall,"Barcelona had looked in pole position to sign Lucas Bergvall, before a late swoop from Tottenham Hotspur saw the 18-year-old midfielder head for the Premier League instead. While the Catalan giants were disappointed, they remain convinced that they already have plenty of quality in the attacking midfield department in La Masia.  One of the brightest players in the academy in Guille Fernandez, who operates in a similar role to Bergvall. Aged just 15, he is already setting things alight, and that included scoring four times for Spainâs U17 side against Germany on Saturday. As per Sport, Guille is regarded within La Masia as being the next youngster to make the step up to the Barcelona first team, joining the likes of Lamine Yamal, Hector Fort and Pau Cubarsi, who are already current members despite all being aged 17 or under. Guille has already made his debut for Barcelonaâs U19 side this season, playing in the UEFA Youth League. If he continues on this current trajectory, he could even be called up to the first team by the end of the season, although itâs important that he isnât rushed to this level.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/15-year-old-La-Masia-sensation-backed-to-make-Barcelona-forget-about-Bergvall/3299755,,11-Feb,all-football-app

6172,Liverpool's Salah accused of 'disrespecting the Real Madrid badge' by Valverde ahead of Champions League final,"Mohamed Salah was 'disrespecting' the Real Madrid badge with his comments about preferring to face them over Manchester City with Liverpool in the Champions League final this Saturday, Federico Valverde said. The Reds will face Los Blancos in a rematch of the 2018 final in Paris, after the former beat Villarreal and the latter saw off City in a dramatic encounter. Before the semi-finals however, Salah admitted he would rather face La Liga's champions than his side's Premier League rivals - a remark that has not gone over well in Spain. Speaking ahead of Saturday's encounter, Valverde - in comments to Club del Deportista published by Marca - addressed the Egypt star's words head-on. ""Obviously, they're words that everyone can take however they want,"" Valverde said. ""I'm his opponent and it's like disrespecting the Real Madrid badge, the players. ""The only thing we must do is give our best, try to show why we're in the final and let's hope we can give another trophy to the fans and to Real Madrid."" While Salah's words may be firing Madrid up, the forward will have his own personal grudge to settle against Los Blancos. The attacker famously was injured in Liverpool's 2018 final defeat to the Spanish outfit, effectively hobbling the Reds' chances throughout and his subsequent World Cup at Russia 2018. With the sting of the Premier League title race likely to still be present, Salah will be fired up to take some revenge in Paris at the weekend.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-s-salah-accused-of-disrespecting-the-real-madrid-badge-/blt750b9db1bc03c880,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

5821,Messi 'not enjoying himself at PSG' and looks 'out of place' at Parc des Princes says ex-Barcelona team-mate Alves,"Lionel Messi is ""not enjoying himself"" at Paris Saint-Germain, according to Dani Alves, who insists his former Barcelona team-mate looks ""out of place"" at Parc des Princes. Messi earned a place in football history during his 21-year stay at Barca, becoming the club's all-time record scorer while winning multiple Liga and Champions League titles. The Camp Nou faithful were forced to say goodbye to the Argentine last summer as the club took drastic steps to reduce their wage bill, with PSG snapping him up on a free transfer, but he has yet to replicate his best form in France. Alves, who played alongside Messi at Barca between 2008 and 2016, thinks the 34-year-old has lost some of his passion for the game since leaving Spain. “For me, no, he is not enjoying himself at PSG, because Leo makes this game special, and he does it when he is having a good time, because when he is having a good time, the others enjoy it,"" the Brazilian right-back told ESPN. “For me it is out of place, right now Leo is out of place there. Because Leo for me lived in the best place in the world to practice what he loves."" Messi has only managed seven goals and 11 assists in 26 appearances across all competitions for PSG. The club initially brought the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner to boost their chances of securing a maiden Champions League crown, but Mauricio Pochettino's men suffered another early exit at the hands of Real Madrid and only have Ligue 1 left to play for. Messi is under contract at Parc des Princes until 2023 with the option of an extra year, but Alves believes he will already be thinking about a potential return to Camp Nou. “Leo always told me where are you going to be better than here? I checked, there is no better place than here. Even when it came out that he was leaving, I sent him the same message that he told me,"" said the Barca star. “For whatever reason he is not here and I hope he can come back. I don't know, but if he comes, let him come here with me, to enjoy at least a little more of all that. “All the people who leave here regret it, everyone. Some will say no, because they don't like to lose, but all the people who leave regret it, because it's better here than anywhere.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-not-enjoying-himself-at-psg-alves/blt4edfdf1a1b9c4798,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

That agreement may not be honoured, amid talk of interest from MLS, with Chiellini conceding that a new challenge may appeal to him if the decision to delay retirement for at least another 12 months is made. Speaking at the unveiling of David Lippi’s new Reset Group agency, Chiellini has said when quizzed on his future plans: “I enjoy the days, I am happy and serene, I must understand and evaluate many things. “I think about the games in the meantime and I enjoy them.” Euro 2020 winner Chiellini added on working with Lippi, the son of World Cup-winning coach Marcello and the only man to have represented him across a distinguished career: “I’ve known Davide since 2001, we have a close bond and we’ve grown together. “I’ve never thought about putting our rapport in doubt and after 20 years, we are still here.” Giorgio Chiellini captained Italy for the first time nine years ago 🤯Nine years later, he's named defender of the tournament as Italy win EURO 2020 🏆𝗟𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗮 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝗻𝗲 🍷 pic.twitter.com/XVOev5XKOW The Bianconeri prised Chiellini away from Roma in 2004, but immediately allowed him to link up with Fiorentina in a co-ownership deal.

He has won 19 trophies, while gracing two Champions League finals, and is the only man to have figured in all nine of Juve’s Serie A title triumphs during a golden era for the club. On an international stage, Chiellini has been capped on 116 occasions and skippered Italy to European Championship glory in 2021.

7850,Merson compares Dalot's superb cross for McTominay's winning goal to Beckham,"Diogo Dalot's pinpoint cross onto the head of Scott McTominay, which helped Manchester United defeat Aston Villa, has been described as a 'David Beckham cross'.  The high praise for the Portuguese full-back came from Paul Merson, who was watching from the Sky Sports studio at Villa Park. In the 86th minute Kobbie Mainoo fought off the attention of two Villa players in the right-hand corner to flick it out towards Dalot. The ball was set invitingly for Dalot and he whipped in a stunning cross first-time with speed, right onto the head of McTominay to nod in to seal a 2-1 win in what is a major boost to United's top four hopes. 'That's a David Beckham cross,' Merson said. 'That's a David Beckham cross... you've just got to get on the end of it.'  In his heyday, Beckham was considered one of the finest wingers of his generation and during his time at United much of the attacking focus came from balls whipped in from out wide. And so comparisons to Beckham, who went on to play for the likes of Real Madrid, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain, is not to be dismissed lightly. Dalot has come in for plenty of criticism this season but this was a positive display following a positive few weeks. For Erik ten Hag, he has never doubted his right back's qualities. 'Everyone gets criticism but he is a fantastic player who is developing very well,' the Dutchman told Match of the Day 2.  'He can play in so many positions and he is improving on crosses. He can score and his defending is improving so I am very pleased with him.'

6544,Which football team does Lewis Hamilton support? F1 star's links to Arsenal explained & why he wants to buy Chelsea,"Lewis Hamilton has revealed that he has always been a football enthusiast, claiming that he played in teams since he was four years old, all the way up to the age of 17. He has admitted that his loyalties were divided across a number of different teams before he eventually settled and nailed one team's colours to the mast.  So, which football team is he a fan of? GOAL brings you everything you need to know about where Hamilton’s football allegiance lies.  Hamilton is an Arsenal fan, and has been since he was six years old, when his sister (Samantha Lockhart), playfully chided him into supporting the Gunners.  The Stevenage-born 37-year-old told Sky Sports in 2022: ""I really wanted to fit in – I was the only kid of colour there but I know that the kids all supported someone different – one was Tottenham, one was Man Utd ""I remember switching between these teams when I was younger and getting home and my sister punching me several times in the arm, beating me and saying ‘you have to support Arsenal’, so I remember at five or six years old that I became a supporter of Arsenal."" Fast forward almost 30 years, and Hamilton's interest in Arsenal saw him invited to participate in an exhibition five-aside match among Gunners legends such as Thierry Henry, Robert Pires, and Sol Campbell, whom he would have cheered on as a fan. The match was advertised as ‘Hamilton vs Henry’ as the two put together their teams of ex players. You can see a video of the game below. Not exactly. Hamilton may be a self-confessed Arsenal fan, but he has an interest in Chelsea too, stemming from his relationship with his uncle.  As he told Sky Sports in 2022: ""My uncle Terry is a big Blues fan so I have been to so many games with him to watch Arsenal and Chelsea play."" He made the admission when pressed on his alleged involvement with a potential Chelsea takeover bid along with a consortium including Serena Williams and Sir Martin Broughton. ""Ultimately, I am a sporting fan. It is the biggest sport in the world and Chelsea is one of the biggest clubs in the world and most successful,"" explained the Formula 1 star.  ""When I heard about this opportunity I was like ‘wow, this is one of the greatest opportunities to be a part of something so great’.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/which-football-team-does-lewis-hamilton-support/bltbe0fdf3ed7de9579,Nick Khairi,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Arsenal overcame a Gabriel Martinelli red card to win the match and momentarily jump into fifth place in the Premier League. ""We saw the way they celebrated the win and that shows the level we are,"" Neves told BBC. ""I didn't see Arsenal celebrating like this in the past 10 years - it was like they won the league."" Wolves manager Bruno Lage went on to express his disappointment with the result. ""I'm disappointed because I thought we were the better team,"" he said. ""Our tempo was very good and we managed the game well but we didn't score our chances and we suffered from a set piece."" The Gunners have now picked up four reds in 2022 - something that has irked manager Mikel Arteta.

7214,Arsenal misfit Willian's dream Corinthians comeback becoming a nightmare amid sick threats and poor form,"A two-time UEFA Cup and Europa League winner, veteran of 14 seasons and 14 major titles in European football and recipient of 70 international caps for Brazil, Willian must have had high hopes when at 33 he embarked on his latest adventure back home for Corinthians in 2021. The ex-Shakhtar Donetsk, Chelsea and Arsenal star, however, has found life at his boyhood club to be a daunting task. After less than a year, he and his team are at their lowest ebb as their season already hangs in the balance. While the current campaign in Brazil has only just begun, the pressure is mounting. Corinthians bowed out of the Paulista state championship at the semi-final stage to hated rivals Sao Paulo and began their Copa Libertadores challenge in the worst possible fashion, going down 2-0 to Always Ready in an abject defeat in the heights of La Paz, Bolivia. The enthusiasm generated by two consecutive wins to begin Serie A has also taken a knock following another humbling reverse, Sunday's comprehensive 3-0 thrashing at the hands of Palmeiras. Corinthians currently lie bottom of their Libertadores group and another negative result on Tuesday at home to Argentine giants Boca Juniors would place their campaign in serious peril, with the spotlight already turned on last year's star signing. Earlier in the year, Willian made a brave stand in using his massive public profile to condemn the epidemic of fan violence that is ravaging all levels of Brazilian football in 2022, leaving several players hurt or even hospitalised from attacks perpetrated in and outside stadiums in a series of shocking incidents. “Nothing is happening to [the aggressors]. They just keep on doing this,” he said on Instagram in March during a stinging attack on the authorities' inability to act. “The authorities tolerate this. I have learned one thing, that we cannot complain about what we tolerate . “I am here to say we are outraged by this situation. We have to join together to combat violence in football.” Less than two months later, Willian became a target himself. Corinthians' Libertadores reverse prompted a string of sickening threats against the winger and his family, which according to an ESPN report prevented his daughters from attending school and kept them confined to their Sao Paulo home due to fears over their safety. “One said that he would set fire to his car and targeted Willian on Instagram,” the player's father Severino da Silva told Brasil Urgente. “There, he talked about his daughters and his family.” Willian also took extreme measures, including the hiring of security personnel to accompany him to the Timao's training sessions, and even considered leaving the club and Brazil altogether out of concerns his family could be in danger, although he has since decided to stay put at least for the time being. On the pitch, meanwhile, the veteran still seems to be struggling to find his rhythm after a prolonged absence from the game. Only sporadically used for Arsenal during his final months at the club in 2021, his return to the game once signing for Corinthians was delayed when it emerged in the wake of Brazil's World Cup qualifying debacle against Argentina that he had not undergone an appropriate Covid-19 quarantine period before beginning training with his new club, leading to a two-week suspension. Willian was forced to wait until September 19 to finally make his debut, almost four and a half months after his last competitive start for the Gunners. In total, the ex-Brazil ace made nine appearances for Corinthians in 2021, completing all 90 minutes just once and failing to score; while this term, despite gaining more regular first-team football, has so far been similarly underwhelming. Willian contributed a solitary goal and another assist to Corinthians' unsuccessful state title bid against minnows such as Serie C outfit Mirassol and Sao Bernardo of Serie D, and while a bright performance in their Serie A opener against Botafogo raised hopes the brilliant, explosive winger that starred for Chelsea and Brazil in his prime he is still well short of finding any consistently impressive form for the Timao. Tuesday's game against Boca might just prove to be a turning point. The Argentines are in less than healthy shape themselves and currently have three central defenders and goalkeeper Agustin Rossi unavailable through injury, while Marcos Rojo is additionally suspended for the clash. The visitors' makeshift defensive preparations represent a golden opportunity for Willian to show his true potential against one of South America's biggest sides and silence his doubters. Fall short, however, and his dream return to Corinthians could end up being a nightmare.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/willian-dream-corinthians-comeback-nightmare-threats/blt28b3f6d20672b3a9,Daniel Edwards,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11156,Stat Attack: Napoli on the Cusp of Record-Shattering Season,"After a tumultuous summer transfer window, Napoli’s dominance this season has been unheralded. The Serie A side lost captain and talisman Lorenzo Insigne to Toronto FC on a free transfer while all-time leading scorer Dries Mertens, a key fixture within the squad for nine seasons, joined Galatasary after his contract in Naples expired. After years of rumours linking him with a move away, defensive colossus and vice-captain Kalidou Koulibaly swapped the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona for Stamford Bridge. In the blink of an eye, Luciano Spalletti lost three instrumental players, three players responsible for 34% of the goals scored by the Partenopei last season. It looked like that signified another rebuild for Napoli after an impressive third-place finish last season. But fast forward to February 2023 and Spalletti’s men are on the cusp of their first Scudetto in 33 years. And they’re smashing records along the way. Here’s a quick stat attack on just how dominant Napoli have been so far this year. With 62 points from 23 games so far, Napoli are the runaway leaders in Serie A this season. In fact, their start has been so impressive that only two sides have ever won more points than the Azzurri at this stage in a league season, with Internazionale (2006-07) and Juventus 2018-19 winning 63 points after their first 23 games. Spalletti’s men are currently 15 points clear from second-placed Internazionale in the table which is the biggest gap between the top two teams after MD23 in a Serie A season in the three points for a win era. When you compare their domestic record to those around Europe’s top five leagues, they’ve amassed more points than any other team. Only Barcelona, who have 59 points from 22 games, could equal their points tally after 23 league matches.   Napoli have risen to the top of Italian football by blitzing opposition defences while being utterly dominant at the back. They’ve scored more goals (56) and conceded fewer goals (15) than any other Serie A team this term, while their goal difference of +41 is the best across Europe’s top five leagues. That offensive firepower has come as a result of Spalletti’s attractive, possession-heavy style of play.  Napoli are excellent at maintaining possession under pressure, and they’re able to progress the ball upfield patiently through long spells of possession. A look at the team style comparison chart below shows just how much of an outlier Napoli’s in-possession style is. They average more passes per sequence and progress the ball directly upfield slower than any other side in the league.  Without the ball, Napoli are aggressive and press high up the pitch, looking to turn the ball over in dangerous areas. No side have forced more shot-ending or goal-ending high turnovers than the Azzurri. As expected, Spalletti’s side dominate Serie A in all key offensive metrics: Napoli’s electric form has not been limited to Italy so far this season, with them also running amok in the Champions League. They finished first in their group for just the second time in the club’s history, scoring 20 goals in the process – the highest tally for an Italian team in the competition’s history and more than any other side in the group stage this campaign. Some of their victories were stunning. On MD1, they thrashed Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool 4-1 (inflicting the Red’s joint-heaviest defeat in UCL history) and then went on to eviscerate Ajax 6-1 on MD3. On that giddy night, the Azzurri became the first Italian side to score six goals on the road in a Champions League game.  With a 2-0 away victory over Eintracht Frankfurt in the first leg of their last 16 tie, Napoli look in pole position to go deep in 2022-23.  Crucial to Napoli’s success this season was their shrewd transfer dealings in the summer.  Min-jae Kim joined from Fenerbahçe to replace Koulibaly, André Zambo Anguissa turned his loan move into a permanent one and Mathías Olivera was signed from Getafe. Giacomo Raspadori and Giovanni Simeone moved to the club on loan with the duo bolstering Spalletti’s options in attack, having scored a combined 27 goals in Serie A last season for Sassuolo and Verona respectively. Tanguy Ndombele was signed on loan from Tottenham Hotspur. But it was the arrival of ​​Khvicha Kvaratskhelia that really caught the eye. The ‘Georgian Lionel Messi’ signed from Dinamo Batumi just four months after moving back to Georgia following the suspension of his Rubin Kazan contract. He has formed a deadly partnership with fellow forward Victor Osimhen. Together the pair have scored 28 goals in Serie A this term. Only Man City duo Erling Haaland and Phil Foden (33) have scored more in the top five European Leagues this season (and in fairness, Haaland has 26 of these.) Of those 26 goals the pair have scored, Osimhen has 18 of them in just 19 games. Only the aforementioned Haaland (26) has scored more goals across the top five European leagues. The Nigerian hasn’t had the luxury of availability so far this campaign, after suffering a facial injury at the start of the season. After making his return in Serie A midway through October, he’s found the net in 12 of 14 league games, including each of the last six. Over that same time frame, Osimhen has scored more goals than any other player in the top five European leagues (Haaland and Rashford next highest with 11). Osimhen’s partnership with Kvaratskhelia has been a real threat so far this season. The Georgian has delivered six assists for Osimhen in Serie A this season, which is more than any other player to a team-mate so far. Kvaratskhelia himself is enjoying an incredible debut campaign in Naples. Thanks to his goal last weekend, the youngster (22y, 005d) become the third youngest player to score at least 10 goals in a single Serie A season with Napoli, after Attila Sallustro (21y, 154d) and Carlo Buscaglia (21y, 150d), both in 1929-30. With 12 goals and 13 assists to his name in all competitions in 2022-23, Kvaratskhelia is just one of four players to have reached over 10 in both categories. And of those players, the winger is the youngest. Napoli fans’ hope of a Serie A crown, their first since the Diego Maradona-led 1989-90 season, looks like it’s starting to become a reality.

10484,Arsenal vs Sheffield United: Preview and Prediction,"Mikel Arteta’s men will look to get back to winning ways when they take on Sheffield United at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday. We look ahead with our data-powered Arsenal vs Sheffield United prediction and preview. Arsenal’s unbeaten start to the Premier League season will face another test on Saturday as they welcome struggling Sheffield United to the Emirates Stadium. The Gunners head into MD 10 third in the league table, five points behind fierce rivals and leaders Tottenham, aided by a solid defence that has conceded just eight goals this season, tied for second fewest in the league. Yet, six of those goals have come at the Emirates and Saturday provides the opportunity for Arsenal to record consecutive home clean sheets in the league for the first time since December 2021 (a run of four), a startling fact considering they have lost just twice on home soil in the Premier League since the start of last term. Saturday pits the Gunners against a side running very low on confidence after a terrible start to life back in the Premier League, with Sheffield United yet to win in their nine games so far and taking one point from a possible 27. Only the Blades themselves, in the 2020-21 campaign, have taken as few as one point from their opening 10 games of a Premier League season, and of course they were relegated to the Championship that time around. They are, perhaps unsurprisingly, bottom of the Premier League and manager Paul Heckingbottom is under fire, yet the poor starts of fellow strugglers Bournemouth, Burnley and Luton mean an upset win on Saturday could take the Blades to within a point of safety. However, history will tell you that an away triumph is unlikely. London has been far from a happy hunting ground of late for Sheffield United, who have lost their last nine visits to the capital in the top flight. They have won just two of their 32 Premier League away games in London, losing 22 and drawing eight. Arsenal are also formidable against promoted sides, especially at home where they are unbeaten in 36 Premier League meetings with teams who have come up the previous season, winning 31 of those encounters. The frustration for Sheffield United fans must be that their team have been competitive in the majority of games, with five of their eight defeats coming by just the one goal. Admittedly, they were also on the receiving end of an 8-0 humiliation at the hands of Newcastle United, and those eight goals account for a large chunk of the Blades’ league-worst goal difference (-17), but no team have scored an equalising goal in more different Premier League games this season than Sheffield United (five). Going on to lose four of those matches has been a major part of the problem. Arsenal won 2-1 at Sevilla in the Champions League on Tuesday, but the victory came at considerable cost as Gabriel Jesus was forced off late on having scored what proved to be the winner, clutching at his hamstring, and the Brazil international could be set for a spell on the sidelines. Thomas Partey, meanwhile, missed the game with Sevilla altogether because of a muscular injury picked up in training on Monday, and Arteta stated afterwards he did not know how long the Ghana international would be unavailable for having only just returned from a groin injury. Heckingbottom could be boosted by the returns of George Baldock and William Osula, both of whom have missed game time of late due to injury, while Oli McBurnie is also likely to be available for the lineup having gone off after his goal from the spot in the 2-1 loss to Manchester United at the weekend. Heckingbottom is not so fortunate at centre-back, where Chris Basham, John Egan and Anel Ahmedhodzic are all out. Arsenal have lost just two of their last 19 league games against Sheffield United, with those defeats coming in consecutive meetings at Bramall Lane in December 2006 and October 2019. The Gunners are unbeaten in 18 home meetings with Sheffield United, last losing at home to the Blades in August 1971 in a 1-0 top-flight defeat. The last encounter between the teams came back in April 2021. Alexandre Lacazette scored twice to lift Arsenal to a 3-0 win against a soon-to-be relegated Sheffield United side that had Heckingbottom as caretaker. He eventually took the job on full-time in November of that year after Slavisa Jokanovic was sacked. Arsenal are yet to lose in nine league outings this season, and the excellent form of Bukayo Saka has played a huge part in that. He has scored (four) or assisted (three) in seven of his eight Premier League appearances this term, including his last six in a row. The last Arsenal player to score or assist a goal in seven consecutive league games was Alexis Sánchez (April 2016), and the last Englishman to do so for the club was Ian Wright (November 1994) – illustrious company for Saka to join. Sheffield United, meanwhile, are yet to pick up a point on the road this season, scoring just three goals and conceding nine in away games, having averaged 1.7 points per game away from home in gaining promotion from the 2022-23 Championship. Their away goal difference of -6 is tied for second worst in the Premier League. Arteta’s men have been experts of the late show this season, with no team scoring more Premier League goals in the final 15 minutes of games this term than Arsenal’s six, netting in the 77th and 84th minutes last weekend to rescue a draw from 2-0 down away at Chelsea. This could be a huge factor on Saturday, with Sheffield United also conceding the most over that period of matches (eight). Arteta will want a strong start from kick-off, a key part of last season’s success that his side have not yet been able to replicate this campaign. They are yet to score in the opening 15 minutes of a game, after scoring a joint-high 13 in that period last term. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta supercomputer is backing Arsenal to pick up a comfortable home victory on Saturday to get back in the win column against a beleaguered Sheffield United at the Emirates Stadium. Across 10,000 match simulations conducted before kick-off, Arsenal came out on top 67.1% of the time, with the Blades coming away with a shock victory in only 11.5% of scenarios. A point would be a great result for Heckingbottom’s men, though they earned a draw in just 21.4% of our supercomputer’s simulations. Arsenal and Sheffield United are expected to be in heavily contrasted positions come the end of the season with the Gunners deemed third favourites to win the Premier League title, given an 8.17% of pipping Manchester City (76.2%) and Liverpool (12.66%) to glory by the Opta supercomputer. Sheffield United, meanwhile, are considered the biggest favourites to go down, getting relegated in 86.8% of Opta’s 10,000 simulations ahead of MD 10. Enjoy this?

With his side trailing by two goals and down to 10 men, M'Changama stepped up to smash in the set-piece from distance and give his side hope in the last nine minutes of the match. The 31-year-old sent the ball sailing into the top corner of the Cameroon goal, leaving goalkeeper Andre Onana with no chance of stopping it. WHAT. A.

The island nation, making their Afcon debut this year, headed into the match as massive underdogs. The gargantuan task was made even worse when an injury and Covid-19 crisis forced them to put an outfield player in goal from the start of the match, followed by centre-back Nadjim Abdou being sent off just seven minutes in. Left-back Chaker Alhadhur was trusted to play in goal and pulled off a magnificent double save to keep his side in the match, but their hopes appeared to be over when Vincent Aboubakar hit the net with 20 minutes left to play.

9538,Conte says he wanted to sign Van Dijk for Chelsea: 'We could've become dominant',"Former Chelsea manager Antonio Conte says that he wanted to buy Virgil van Dijk in the summer of 2017 but the transfer didn't happen.The centre-back, who played for Southampton at that time, ended up joining Liverpool in the 2017/2018 winter transfer window. The rest, as they say, is history, but it's weird to think that the current Reds' captain could have worn Chelsea's colours. “My history says that I always arrived at my clubs in a difficult situation with problems. I always build,” Conte said in an interview with the Telegraph. “After my first season at Chelsea, when we won the title, we could have become dominant in England.

3615,Football's Tom Brady? Record-breaking Ronaldo propels Man Utd past Spurs with stunning hat-trick,"Manchester United 3-2 Tottenham: Match Statistics If Cristiano Ronaldo promises to return from every trip to Portugal with a hat-trick, Ralf Rangnick would probably grant his star striker a mini-break every week.  After a week in which his off-field activity provoked more debate, the Manchester United forward showed on it why he will be remembered as one of the greatest of all time by hitting a sensational treble in a 3-2 win over Tottenham. Indeed, it was fitting that NFL legend Tom Brady was present at Old Trafford on Saturday to witness Ronaldo get his first hat-trick for the club since 2008. The American took to his feet to applaud the Portugal international after the 37-year-old completed his hat-trick in front of the Stretford End with just nine minutes to go in an absorbing Premier League encounter. Ronaldo was disappointed to find out he would not be part of Ralf Rangnick’s starting XI for the Manchester derby last weekend but he responded in the best possible fashion, with his three goals, and excellent all-round performance against Spurs, arguably illustrating why he should always start up front. His first goal – a stunning strike from 25 yards out into the top corner – will no doubt be his favourite from an aesthetic perspective. However, his textbook headed winner from Alex Telles’ corner was clearly even more satisfying, given it also decided a top-four battle in United's favour. CRISTIANO RONALDO GETS HIS HAT-TRICK ⚽️ ⚽️ ⚽️ pic.twitter.com/UKTtvVrXFe Ronaldo's second effort may have been a tap-in but if there was any doubt about the difficulty of his hat-trick, one only needed to look at the fact that his expected goals tally for the game was 0.85. Ronaldo's latest hat-trick also saw him become the game's all-time leading scorer, with 807 goals.  Records will, of course, be of little interest to Rangnick, who is trying to ensure that United qualify for next season's Champions League, and the German will have taken far more encouragement out of how well Ronaldo linked with the ever-improving Jadon Sancho. Pleasingly, the Portuguese also showed a willingness to work hard and make runs that caused Tottenham's back-line all sorts of problems. He was involved in nearly every positive move United made. Nobody had more touches than Ronaldo in the opposition box and his passing accuracy in the final third was 93 per cent. Of course, United needed this kind of performance from their talisman, as this was a must-win match for Rangnick's side, who have now moved back above Arsenal into fourth place, albeit having played four games more than the Gunners. And as Spurs boss Antonio Conte pointed out in his post-match interview with Sky Sports, ""Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are the two best players in the world in this era. Cristiano Ronaldo becomes football's 𝘼𝙇𝙇 𝙏𝙄𝙈𝙀 top goalscorer with 806 goals 🤯 pic.twitter.com/gHlsFaR4u9 ""When you play against this type of player, they’re decisive. Without Cristiano Ronaldo, for United it wouldn’t have been a good night."" Still, while this victory certainly won't paper over any of the cracks in this United side, this was a marked improvement on the performance they produced in last weekend's 4-1 loss at Manchester City. The defence remains a concern, though, as Tottenham’s wing-back's wreaked havoc at times, peppering United's box with crosses of all kinds. So, there was a depressing air of inevitability about struggling captain Harry Maguire putting one cut-back into his own net to gift Spurs an equaliser with 18 minutes left.  There will have been nobody more relieved, then, when Ronaldo rose to power head another late winner for United. The roar at full-time from the home support only further hammered home just how important a victory this was for the hosts. United still have it all to do to finish in the top four but with Ronaldo once again showing why some consider him the Tom Brady of football, nothing seems out of reach.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tom-brady-record-breaking-ronaldo-man-utd-spurs-hat-trick/blt5dafa015fad60a21,Charlotte Duncker,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5665,Former Arsenal chief scout Rowley appointed by Wenger passes away after short illness,"Arsenal have announced that the club's former chief scout Steve Rowley has passed away after a short illness. Rowley spent decades at the club, initially joining in 1980 before moving up to chief scout during Arsene Wenger's spell as manager.

2484,Athletic Bilbao’s new away kit celebrates 'Los Leones',"Athletic Bilbao are known for their red and white stripes. The colours have been used since 1910 and still form the backbone of its home kit, including the 2022/23 design that was revealed last week. For the away kit, however, New Balance and Athletic Bilbao have taken inspiration from the club’s “Los Leones” nickname. The name, which translates as “The Lions,” can be traced back to the club’s origins next to San Mames church, with the grizzly death of the titular saint inspiring the nickname and the name of the club’s current stadium. Celebrating this “Los Leones” moniker, the new away kit features an eye-catching red and black lion-inspired graphic across its “Magnet Grey” jersey. This print is contrasted against the plain black sleeves, shorts and socks that complete the Athletic Club away kit. As well as referencing the “Los Leones” nickname, the kit’s design is also a reference to the “fierce spirit” of the club. Launching the kit, defender Iñigo Martínez said that it “shows what it means to be part of the Athletic Club family. It’s hard to put into words what it means to play for this team, but I’ll wear this new shirt with pride next season, as will the rest of the team.” UK: Get it from Athletic club shop for €79.95 US: Get it from New Balance for $89.99",https://www.goal.com/en/news/athletic-bilbao-new-away-kit/blt504aedab151fe567,Jack Stanley,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1762,"Borussia Dortmund vs Bayern Munich: Predictions, odds & betting tips","The latest instalment of Der Klassiker takes place on Saturday evening as Borussia Dortmund host Bayern Munich in a meeting of the top two sides in the Bundesliga. Bayern head into the clash a point ahead of their rivals but Dortmund's home record is formidable. The fans at Signal Iduna Park have seen their side win their last 11 consecutive home league matches and bet365 price a Dortmund victory at  3/1 (4.00).Bayern, meanwhile, have won each of the last six editions of this fixture in all competitions and can be backed at 3/4 (1.75) with the draw at 10/3 (4.33). His form may not have been enough to claim the Ballon d'Or, yet Robert Lewandowski has been sensational in the final third, netting 14 times in 13 league games this season. The Polish forward can be backed at 11/4 (3.75) to open the scoring against his former club, ahead of Erling Haaland who is offered at 4/1 (5.00). Serge Gnabry, meanwhile, is offered at 13/2 (7.50) while Donyell Malen can be backed at 8/1 (9.00). Dortmund finished 14 points behind their Bavarian rivals last season, and while they may still end the campaign a good distance off the pace, currently Marco Rose's side are keeping up in impressive fashion. Naturally it helps to have the scoring prowess of a player like Erling Haaland, yet Dortmund have goals all over the pitch with 11 different scorers this term and they have netted in 24 consecutive home Bundesliga matches. Bayern for their part have scored in every Bundesliga game they have contested since February 16, 2020 and can always be relied upon for goals seemingly irrespective of the opponent. Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals is priced at 1/2 (1.50) which looks like a nailed-on selection but is probably too short a price for a stand-alone bet. Instead consider backing Bayern to score in both halves at evens (2.00) which looks a shrewd way to invest in a game with plenty of goals. Odds correct at the time of writing.

10641,Manchester United vs Brighton: Prediction and Preview,"Brighton have the chance to make it four league wins in a row against Manchester United. Can they do it? We look ahead to Saturday’s Premier League game with our Manchester United vs Brighton prediction and preview. Manchester United will be delighted to be back in the familiar surroundings of Old Trafford after suffering two defeats out of two games on the road this season. They have won their opening two matches in the Premier League on home soil, albeit in unconvincing style.  A 1-0 win over Wolves, when they were mostly on the back foot and survived a late penalty appeal against André Onana, was followed by a 3-2 win over Nottingham Forest after being two goals down in the opening four minutes. This means they have maximum points, but also room for improvement at the Theatre of Dreams. Erik ten Hag’s side earned more points than any other team bar Manchester City on home soil last season, but one blip on that record was a 2-1 defeat against this coming Matchday’s opponents Brighton in a sobering Premier League debut as coach for the Dutchman. And United will definitely be aware of Roberto de Zerbi’s side’s attacking threat; Albion were the joint-top scorers on the road last season with 35 goals and are this season’s top scorers overall after the opening month of the season with 12 strikes. The Italian has imbued the team with an attractive, fluid attacking style and their ability on the ball has been key to this. Brighton rank second for average possession (63%) and first for shots (614) in the Premier League since the former Shakhtar Donetsk coach took charge. Manchester United face another of last season’s top six after already suffering defeat at the hands of Arsenal last time out, knowing that they struggled in these encounters last season. No team took fewer points than Ten Hag’s side (10) in the head-to-head meetings of the top six, while only Man City took more points from these games than Brighton (15). Their free-flowing, counter-attacking style seems ideally suited to the bigger occasions. United will be hoping Rasmus Højlund can add some much-needed firepower up front. In the last 11 Premier League matches, excluding penalties, the team’s top scorer is Casemiro with three goals. Højlund looked a real handful for defenders in his cameo against Arsenal and Ten Hag will be hoping the young striker can make an impact in the starting lineup sooner rather than later; at the very least, United will be able to call upon Victor Lindelof and Lisandro Martínez at the back after their respective injury troubles. Brighton have their own prodigious young talent in Evan Ferguson. Among players with five or more non-penalty Premier League goals since the start of last season, only Erling Haaland (92) and Roberto Firmino (110) have a better minutes per non-penalty goal rate than Brighton’s 18-year-old striker (116). Indeed, the only players to score more goals overall in the competition while aged 18 or under than the Irishman’s 10 are Michael Owen (28), Wayne Rooney (15) and Francis Jeffers (12). But perhaps the most likely scorer for the south-coast side is Pascal Groß. The versatile German has scored six goals in the Premier League against Man Utd and only eight players have netted more against the Red Devils in the history of the competition; it’s also worth noting Ferguson and Danny Welbeck are both injury doubts, though Ansu Fati could be in line for a debut. With Brighton on a run of 20 consecutive games of scoring but without a clean sheet in their last eight outings, and United managing only one shutout in their last six Premier League games, this should be a goal-filled encounter to savour. There has never been a draw in this fixture, with United winning seven and Brighton five of their 12 Premier League encounters, but Albion have won the last three in a row. The two sides also met in the FA Cup last season, and although Man Utd won that game on a penalty shootout after a goalless draw, it means United haven’t seen one of their players score in the last four meetings with Brighton in all competitions. United’s only goal in those four clashes was an Alexis Mac Allister own goal in the 2-1 defeat at Old Trafford last season. Groß has scored six goals in the Premier League against United – more than he has netted against any other opponent. United lost this exact fixture 2-1 on the opening weekend last season, having won eight and drawn one of their nine previous home league games against Brighton. Excluding own goals, Bruno Fernandes has either scored (four) or assisted (two) six of Manchester United’s last eight Premier League goals against Brighton (75%). Manchester United kept more clean sheets than any other team in the Premier League last season but have registered just one shutout in their last six matches. Defeat to Brighton would see them suffer as many as three defeats in their first five matches of a league campaign for the first time since 1989-90 under Alex Ferguson. De Zerbi’s men have scored at least once in each of their last 15 away league matches, with the club record for this standing at 16 games, achieved in League One from August 2009 to February 2010. Nevertheless, Man Utd have won each of their last eight Premier League games at Old Trafford, most recently enjoying a longer home winning run in the competition in March 2013 (12) en route to winning their last league title under Ferguson. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta supercomputer favours Man Utd to make the most of home advantage, giving Ten Hag’s team a 46.4% chance of victory against Brighton. That’s actually the second-highest home win percentage of any team in the Premier League this weekend (behind Tottenham at home to Sheffield United), but United’s home form is really strong. They lost just once on home soil last season – albeit against Brighton – and that came in a game very early on in Ten Hag’s tenure.  Brighton have a 25.7% probability of registering their fourth successive victory over United, while the draw stands at 27.9%. In our overall Premier League predictions, Manchester United’s top-four chances have dropped quite a bit since the start of the season, when they were judged to have a 63.2% likelihood. It’s since dropped to just 28.4%; they cannot afford to slip further back in their quest for Champions League football.  Our supercomputer now predicts them to finish fifth, while it thinks Brighton’s most likely finishing position is one spot behind in sixth.  Enjoy this?

7023,Chelsea fans warned by MP to stop chanting for Roman Abramovich due to 'Putin's barbaric acts',"Chelsea supporters once again showed their support to sanctioned owner Roman Abramovich during a 3-1 win at Norwich, with technology minister Chris Philp urging Blues followers to reconsider their actions given the “barbaric acts” of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The UK government is taking decisive action against those that boast ties to a regime in Eastern Europe that has invaded neighbouring Ukraine and generated widespread condemnation. Abramovich is being prevented from making any money out of his British enterprises as a result of the restrictions being imposed – with talk of a sale at Stamford Bridge being put on hold – but those that have seen their club win 21 trophies during his reign in west London continue to back the billionaire’s cause. Chelsea fans have taken to chanting Abramovich’s name before Premier League fixtures, despite the 55-year-old being linked to Putin while also trying to find a buyer, and those indulging in such actions are being asked to reassess their behaviour. Philp told BBC Radio Four’s Today Programme: “I’m a football fan myself, I’m a [Crystal] Palace fan, in south London. So I understand why fans are very attached to their football clubs. “But Roman Abramovich is someone who has been sanctioned now, yesterday morning, for his very close links to Vladimir Putin and the Putin regime. “And I just say respectfully to the Chelsea fans, I know he’s done a lot for the club, but the humanitarian situation in Ukraine and what the Russian regime are doing to civilians - shelling maternity hospitals and shooting civilians who are fleeing down humanitarian corridors - and that is more important than football. “And I say that as a football fan myself, and I would just ask them to keep that in mind.” He added when pressed further on the Abramovich saga, which has led to Chelsea being unable to sell match tickets while also closing their club shop and losing a deal with shirt sponsors Three: “I understand why Chelsea fans have some affection for him but, when the regime he is associated with is committing atrocities, that is more important than football. “So I would ask them to think very carefully before doing that [chanting] again because the barbaric acts of the Putin regime which Abramovich has supported is far more important than football.” Chelsea can be sold, as long as Roman Abramovich or the Russian Federation doesn't benefit from the sale.Chelsea are in dialogue with the UK government discussing what to do next. pic.twitter.com/3upNw3pQeS Chelsea, who remain in the hunt for a top-four finish alongside bids for Champions League and FA Cup glory this season, are due to be back in Premier League action on Sunday. Newcastle are next on the agenda for the Blues, in what will be a first home outing for the club since Abramovich saw his assets frozen. Chelsea have at least four more outings at Stamford Bridge to come after that, with the club being informed that there are ways in which ticketing restrictions can be lifted if they apply for the right licences and can prove that Abramovich stands to benefit in no way.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-fans-warned-stop-chanting-roman-abramovich-putin/blt53d3d06ada9afc12,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

7122,'We'll see what happens' - Man City star Bernardo Silva responds to Barcelona transfer rumours,"Manchester City star Bernardo Silva is staying quiet regarding recent reports linking him to a move to Barcelona. The Catalan side are said to be considering a move for the Portugal player amid reports the club recently met with his agent Jorge Mendes. Barcelona head coach Xavi is said to be an admirer of the 27-year-old, but the attacking midfielder would not give his verdict on a possible move. Asked about the links to Barcelona in the wake of Portugal's 2-0 win against Czech Republic on Thursday, Bernardo Silva said: ""Unfortunately, I won't be able to answer, because I'm at the service of the national team and super focused on the game that remains.  ""When the season ends, we'll see what happens."" The former Benfica and Monaco star has been a standout performer for City since his arrival in 2017.

40,Paris via Beirut! Liverpool fans set for another Champions League trip to remember,"The exodus is well and truly under way. All week, the UK’s airports, ports and train stations have been filled. Filled with red shirts, with scouse accents, with beaming smiles and with the sound of hope and optimism. As one supporter at Lime Street station joked: “Paris won’t know what’s hit it!” For Liverpool fans, the European Cup will always be the one which gets the pulse racing. The Premier League may have eluded them, but they will descend on the French capital en masse this weekend, as Jurgen Klopp’s side look to end a brilliant season with yet another piece of silverware. It has been suggested that around 40,000 Reds will make the short trip across the English Channel to watch their side take on Real Madrid in the Stade de France on Saturday evening, but anecdotal evidence suggests that may be a conservative estimate. After all, the main talking point among Liverpudlians - Klopp’s magnificent team aside - has been clear for weeks now. ‘How are you getting to Paris?’ Some have had their trips planned since February, when UEFA confirmed it would be switching the venue of the final from St Petersburg. Flights and hotels were booked almost on the spot, even though Liverpool were in the midst of a tough last-16 clash with Inter at the time. “You have to gamble with things like that,” says Reds fan and journalist Kristian Walsh. “You have to book early, otherwise you can end up paying £500 ($624) or more for a simple two-hour flight.” Walsh and his group of away-day regulars already had their St Petersburg route planned - via Helsinki, if you are interested - but as soon as Paris was confirmed they took the plunge again. They will spend a night in Brussels before travelling across to France by train on Friday. “The biggest thing, and I can’t stress this enough, is that we fly from Liverpool,” he says. “Flying from Manchester for the semi-final [with Villarreal], the security queue was like something from The Hunger Games!” The plane-train combination seems to be a popular one with supporters, and no wonder, given the cost of direct flights. A return from Liverpool or Manchester to Paris, flying on Friday and returning on Sunday, comes in at around £750 ($937), while some companies, such as Sport Options or Football Travel Ltd, are running day trips, priced at around £650 ($812). Such expense means many fans have had to get creative. Brussels and Amsterdam are the most popular stop-offs, but Frankfurt, Geneva, Cologne and Zurich are other options. All are within a few hours of Paris via train. And how about something a little more left-field? You may have read about the Sunderland fan who travelled via Mallorca to London for the League One play-off final, but how about the Reds supporter who will head to Paris this week via Beirut? “He shall remain nameless,” laughs Walsh. “But he’s known for his, shall we say, ‘unusual’ travel plans. “Initially he was flying via Tirana, I think, but he realised that was a bit silly, so he changed it. The things we do for football!” What a football team but more importantly what a group of wonderful people who have helped me get through the last two years and I’ll be forever thankful. This hasn’t been easy but it would have been a lot harder without these. pic.twitter.com/cOkXZhlXYu He can say that again. The world’s apparent desire to fleece supporters never ceases to amaze. Eurostar bumped its prices up as soon as it became apparent that at least one English club would be reaching the final, while a quick scan for hotel rooms in Paris this weekend tells you everything, with single rooms in two-star venues priced at more than £550 ($687) a night. Some have even seen bookings cancelled and then re-listed, as vendors look to maximise their profits. “Unfortunately, that is the world we live in,” said a rueful Klopp earlier this month. It is little wonder, then, that some fans have booked into campsites on the outskirts of the city, many more will sleep in cars and on coaches, while others are opting for the simple but risky “staying out all night” option. Tickets are another issue - the biggest issue, in fact. UEFA’s decision to allocate less than 20,000 tickets to Liverpool fans drew stinging criticism from Klopp, as well as from Spirit of Shankly, the supporters’ union, and though many were given a second chance through the sale of 12,000 general admission tickets, the fact remains that almost a third of the stadium’s 80,000 capacity will be taken up by UEFA delegates, sponsors, commercial partners and hospitality tickets. It means the black market is thriving. GOAL has seen £50 ($62) tickets being re-sold for more than £1500 ($1800), and the fact that more than 20 percent of Liverpool’s 19,618 allocation were priced at more than £400 ($500) to begin with tells you plenty. The club this week urged social media companies to close the accounts of fans attempting to sell final tickets online. Liverpool said they had themselves cancelled the tickets of 13 individuals, who it is understood had been demanding thousands of pounds from fellow supporters for their tickets. “It’s no surprise,” says Reds fan Dan Nicolson. “When the allocation is so low, these things are bound to happen. It’s the same every year, it just so happens that Liverpool have tended to be in more finals than most. “Hopefully one day, there will be a concerted and unified message from fans that paltry allocations that mean actual supporters are in the minority in the stadium are not good enough.” Nicolson is the driving force behind the legendary ‘BOSS Night’ events, which have provided the colour and soundtrack to so many of Liverpool’s European away days in recent years. The party in Kyiv’s Shevchenko Park in 2018 will never be forgotten, while Virgil van Dijk watched videos of the following year’s event in Madrid’s Plaza Felipe II as part of his pre-match preparation. “It gave me chills,” the Dutchman told GOAL. “I saw it after lunch and I was so excited, I just wanted to get out there, get the trophy and party with them.” What does @VirgilvDijk think of his song?I think he quite likes it, @JamieWebster94...#LFC pic.twitter.com/VmIYKLMr1p There will, after much discussion and plenty of back and forth with the French authorities, be another ‘BOSS’ event on Saturday. It will take place at Cours de Vincennes in the east of the city, with the likes of Jamie Webster, Kieran Molyneux and Timo Tierney, as well as the Lightning Seeds and Cast frontman John Power, all scheduled to perform. “We’re delighted to get it sorted,” says Nicolson. “After the success of Kyiv and Madrid, it would have been a crying shame if we had not been able to have another afternoon to remember in Paris. Hopefully everyone can enjoy themselves now.” That - “enjoyment” - seems to be a word which crops up everywhere when speaking to supporters. “If you can’t have fun as a Liverpudlian now, you’re in the wrong game,” says Walsh. “It's not just about the destination, it's the journey. That's where the enjoyment comes, from the ride. Even for a pessimist like me, the ride this season - and over the past few years - has been something incredible."" For Nicolson, the key figure underpinning everything is Klopp. With the German at the helm, everyone is on board. “He is this century’s Shankly,” he says. “I don’t think you can even refer to him as generational. He’s more rare! “Everything comes from him. The feel-good factor, the winning mentality, the way everything is just fun. It emanates from Klopp and infects us all! “A friend said to me recently that supporting Liverpool FC is like one big stag do, but a stag do you actually want to be on! “And he’s right. It’s dead exciting, everyone is just having a great time."" That will continue this weekend, for sure. Whatever the result in Paris, there will be a celebratory parade in Liverpool on Sunday afternoon, where fans will line the streets to pay tribute to the heroes who have taken them on the ride of a lifetime. ""They deserve it,"" says Walsh. ""And hopefully, they'll have that Champions League trophy to show off...""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/paris-via-beirut-liverpool-fans-champions-league-final/bltdeae67ebd09da888,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1485,"Espanyol vs Barcelona: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Barcelona travel to the RCDE stadium on Sunday for the Catalan derby in La Liga against Espanyol. Xavi Hernandez's side come into the game following an impressive 4-2 defeat of champions Atletico Madrid last weekend with the Blaugrana extending their unbeaten league run to seven matches. Espanyol, meanwhile, are yet to win a league game in 2022, enduring three defeats and a draw in their four La Liga clashes so far this year. Xavi's first match in charge of Barca came against Espanyol back in November at Camp Nou where the visitors spurned a number of extremely clear chances to score, in a match which ended 1-0 to the hosts. Barcelona can be backed at 3/4 (1.75) with bet365 to claim another win, while Vicente Moreno's Espanyol are available at 4/1 (5.00) to record what would be their first derby win at home in the league since 2007. The draw is on offer at 13/5 (3.60). Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang made his Barcelona debut off the bench last weekend and the former Arsenal striker is the shortest priced player to score first at 10/3 (4.33). Ferran Torres is offered at 9/2 (5.50), the same price as Luuk De Jong, while Espanyol's Raul De Tomas, the joint top-scoring Spaniard in La Liga, is available at 11/2 (6.50). Signs of improvement are beginning to be seen from Barcelona and, having strengthened the squad in the transfer window, the Blaugrana are expected to continue to climb up the table. Last weekend's win over Atletico saw them move into a Champions League spot, and Barca's impressive firepower should help them win plenty of matches between now and the end of the season. However, they remain vulnerable defensively with the side keeping just two clean sheets in their last 13 competitive fixtures, and Espanyol will be confident of finding the back of the net on Sunday. Los Pericos really should have scored at Camp Nou, with Raul De Tomas hitting the woodwork and Landry Dimata missing from just a few yards out, and Espanyol are a side who have been finding the back of the net consistently this term. Indeed, since their blank in the derby back in November, Espanyol have netted in 12 of their subsequent 13 matches and backing them to do so once more makes sense. Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals looks like a promising selection for this game and is offered at the healthy looking price of 11/10 (2.10). You can watch La Liga live on the go with your iPhone, iPad or Android device through your bet365 account. All you need is a funded account or to have placed a bet in the last 24 hours to qualify.

55,New Man City signing Haaland buys all 33 of his Dortmund team-mates luxury Rolex watches worth up to €15k as farewell gift,"Erling Haaland bid farewell to his Borussia Dortmund team-mates by lavishing them with expensive gifts.  Bild reports that the striker, who will join Manchester City in a £51 million ($63m) deal this summer, gave each of his 33 Dortmund co-stars a luxury Rolex watch.  The watches are estimated to have cost between €13,000 to €15,000. The watches were delivered by two limousines from Netherlands - including a personal try-on service for every team-mate. Each watch came in a special box that was adorned with three photos: one with Haaland's shirt number, one with the 21-year-old in a celebration pose and another with the DFB-Pokal in his hands.  His initials, EBH (for Erling Braut Haaland), were printed on it, too. Other employees were also given watches from the striker. Instead of Rolex watches, they each were given an Omega-brand watch from the Speedmaster Professional line. They each cost between €5,000 and €7,000.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-city-signing-haaland-buys-33-dortmund-team-mates-luxury/bltb43db9889baf4aff,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1767,Lukaku and Christensen hooked and Rudiger injured: Arsenal defeat shows scale of Chelsea's summer problems,"Chelsea's 4-2 home defeat to Arsenal on Wednesday threw up a host of different issues facing any new owners when they finally purchase the club.  Manager Thomas Tuchel had to ring the changes in his 55th match of the season after an FA Cup semi-final victory against Crystal Palace on Sunday.  It was a chance for the fringe players in his squad to step up and, unfortunately for them, it did not go well.  Up front, Romelu Lukaku earned his first league start for Chelsea in two months. On his last start, he broke the Premier League record for fewest touches in a match over 90 minutes, managing just seven touches of the ball at Selhurst Park.  Although he was more involved this time around, he had just the one shot and two touches in Arsenal's box before being substituted in the 60th minute.  As he came off, there was a smattering of boos from the East Stand next to the bench. ""Maybe you must ask the fans,” Tuchel said when quizzed about the reaction. “You heard it so you need to ask the people.” The Belgium superstar may also have been, in small part, at fault for the team's general poor defensive display. FT: Chelsea 2-4 ArsenalIt sounds like a classic, indeed it was for Arsenal, but it was more like a school yard match. Entertaining nonetheless. Chelsea's Champions League spot cushion is down to 5 points with West Ham and Man United up next. #CFC #CHEARS The Blues' pressing system involves all 10 outfield players. While they may have created two goals for Cesar Azpilicueta and Timo Werner, they could not protect their own goal.  It was Barcelona-bound Andreas Christensen at fault for the opening goal; his lax pass back to Edouard Mendy cut out by Eddie Nketiah who made it 1-0.  After their first equaliser, the Blues were weak in midfield, allowing Granit Xhaka to drive from his side's own box into the opposition half. Eventually, after some soft defending, Emile Smith Rowe curled in a second. The Chelsea supporters began chanting for Thiago Silva, who was left on the bench, to resolve the issues, while also perhaps sending a message to Christensen who opted not to renew his contract in west London.  “He said he cannot continue so I think he had some problems,"" Tuchel said when asked by GOAL about withdrawing Christensen at half-time.  ""I don’t take a player out because he makes one mistake. To say the pitch is difficult to play here, it maybe sounds like an excuse but it is a very, very difficult pitch that we have here. It’s not in our favour. The ball bounces very awkwardly in front of Andreas when he wants to play this ball."" With the legendary Brazilian defender on the pitch, things did not improve drastically.  Goalscorer Azpilicueta was at fault for both the third and fourth goals. For the third, he gave the ball away in midfield and allowed Nketiah a chance to dominate both Thiago Silva and Malang Sarr to score.  For the fourth, he bafflingly fouled Bukayo Saka off the ball but in the penalty area. The young England international netted from the spot to secure victory. After that, the club captain was seen arguing with a supporter and could himself follow Christensen to join Xavi at Camp Nou in the summer.  The Catalan club have had extensive talks with him already but the Blues have utilised a clause in his deal to extend it by a year. Sarr, meanwhile, was in the starting line-up due to a minor groin injury to star defender Antonio Rudiger.  ""We conceded seven goals with Toni against Brentford and Real Madrid, that answers the question,"" Tuchel said of his defensive changes. ""It's not about individual players."" Tuchel has played Rudiger in 47 matches and for 4,380 minutes this season. The Germany international has played 600 more minutes than any other player, the goalkeepers included.  The manager was ready to make Rudiger the club's highest-paid defender in history before sanctions were imposed. The club can no longer offer him that contract as they consider potential new owners and Manchester United, Real Madrid, PSG and Juventus are among clubs looking to take advantage of the situation.  This match showed what Chelsea would be missing without Rudiger and, even more so, with other issues still plaguing the backline.  Chelsea remains massively ahead in the race for the top four, but will find bigger issues come the summer. ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lukaku-christensen-hooked-rudiger-injured-arsenal-defeat-chelsea-/blt58b17113eb674f85,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1823,Manchester United make £13m transfer swoop for Malacia after reaching De Jong compromise,"Manchester United are trying to secure a late transfer swoop for Tyrell Malacia after closing in on a compromise fee of £56 million plus add-ons for Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong.  The Feyenoord left-back shares the same agent as De Jong, and Man Utd have made it clear they want both players.  Malacia was close to agreeing a move to Lyon, but Man Utd have agreed a fee of almost £13m plus add-ons and are hopeful of convincing the Dutchman to opt for Old Trafford instead.  United are interested in signing Malacia. He shares the same agent as De Jong - with #mufc making it clear they are interested in both Malacia has spent his entire senior career at Feyenoord – making his debut aged 18 in the Champions League against Napoli in 2017. He has gone on to become a Netherlands international and impressed Ten Hag with his performances in the Eredivisie. The decision on his future rests in the hands of the player, who looked set to move to France with Lyon until Man Utd's late intervention.  GOAL can confirm a fee has been agreed with Feyenoord, meaning it is now up Malacia to determine what his next move will be, but Man Utd hope the prospect of joining up with countryman Ten Hag proves decisive. The firming up of their pursuit of the 22-year-old comes as a deal for De Jong edges ever closer, with Barcelona resigning themselves to the fact they will not receive their £86m valuation for the Netherlands international.  Sources close to negotiations insist the transfer of De Jong is not yet complete, with add-ons still to be agreed, as well as the player’s personal terms.  However a significant hurdle has been passed with the two sides compromising on an initial fee, which is significantly lower than  Barca were originally holding out for.  The Catalan giants’ delicate financial situation weakened their hand in negotiations, with Man Utd football director John Murtough adamant he would not overpay for the 25-year-old.  The player, meanwhile, has repeatedly indicated he wants to stay at Camp Nou – but the move is now expected to go through, with De Jong having a strong relationship with his former Ajax manager Ten Hag.  He is seen as pivotal to the system Ten Hag wants to implement at Man Utd as a player who can pick the ball in deep positions and carry it forward.  While Old Trafford sources always insisted they would look at alternative targets, it is clear De Jong is the midfielder their new manager wants above all others, having worked with him at Ajax before his move to Barca in 2019.  The completion of De Jong is expected to pave the way for a raft of business at Old Trafford, with Ten Hag wanting to bring in five new players before the start of the season.  An offer has already been made to out-of-contract Christian Eriksen. Ajax winger Antony is a leading forward target and the Brazilian is determined to move to Man Utd.  Lisandro Martinez, also from Ajax, is among the central defensive options being considered by Ten Hag, while Inter right back Denzel Dumfries is also admired by the Dutchman.

7827,Liverpool fans slam the club's medical team as Arnold suffers new injury setback,"Liverpool fans have taken to social media to question the club's medical team amid the high number of injuries hitting the senior squad.  On Wednesday, it emerged that Trent Alexander-Arnold is set to miss the Carabao Cup final at the end of the month after aggravating a knee injury in the win over Burnley. He joins Dominik Szoboszlai and Thiago Alcantara in aggravating injuries, and missing games at a crucial time of Liverpool's season as they fight on four fronts. Szoboszlai suffered his own setback when he played against Chelsea on January 31, as he returned from a hamstring issue, before Thiago sustained a muscle injury against Arsenal on February 4 on his first game back after injury. Fans on X (formerly Twitter) felt that the Liverpool medical team had to change their ways due to the escalating number of recurring injuries.   One noted: 'It really is not a good look on Liverpoolâs medical team the fact Trent, Szoboszlai and Thiago are all injured so quickly after returning from injury. 'Trent and Szoboszlai are the major concerns especially as itâs the same injury thatâs reoccurred so quickly.' Another added: 'Questions need to be asked about Liverpoolâs medical team. Theyâre rushing people back from injuries and constantly underestimates the length of these injuries. 'âWill be out for three weeksâ quickly turns into six/seven. It happens time and time again.' 'Liverpool medical team need investigation man, wtf are these injuries so ridiculous,' wrote a third, while another said: 'Liverpool FC have to fire their medical team by the way. Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dominik Szoboszlai aggravating injuries is a disgrace.'       Alexander-Arnold, Szoboszlai and Thiago are not the only injury issues currently affecting Liverpool's first team. Joel Matip sustained an ACL injury in December, with no timescale placed on his recovery, while Mo Salah sustained a muscle injury whilst on international duty with Egypt at AFCON last month. The injured players create a selection headache during a busy period for Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp. Liverpool travel to Brentford on Saturday, host Luton Town next Wednesday, and then go into the League Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley on February 25.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Liverpool-fans-slam-the-clubs-medical-team-as-Arnold-suffers-new-injury-setback/3301859,,1 day ago,all-football-app

This time, though, I think Arsenal will find a way through — and carry on their celebrations.""Mikel Arteta's side will have a point to prove after what happened last time, but their motivation here is more about the fact they have just put themselves in the thick of the title race, and they cannot afford to slip up.""Sutton's prediction: West Ham 0–2 ArsenalArsenal's Premier League title hopes received a major boost last week when they beat rivals Liverpool 3–1 at the Emirates Stadium.The Gunners understand that they have to continue picking up points in order to keep up with the Reds and Manchester City in the second half of the season.'We know what to do': De Bruyne cheekily warns Arsenal as title race heats upWest Ham – Arsenal 0:6 (0:4, 0:2)11 February, 14:00, London StadiumStatisticsLineupsTableAll matchesWest Ham: Areola, Emerson (Cresswell 76), Aguerd, Zouma (Mavropanos 46), Coufal, Alvarez (Phillips 46), Souček, Johnson, Ward-Prowse, Kudus, BowenArsenal: Raya, Kiwior, dos Santos Magalhães, Saliba, White (Cedric Soares 77), Havertz, Rice (Mohamed El Nenny 67), Odegaard, Martinelli (Nwaneri 77), Trossard (Nketiah 67), Saka (Nelson 67)Goals: 0:1 - 32  Saliba (Rice), 0:2 - 41  Saka (pen.), 0:3 - 44  dos Santos Magalhães (Rice), 0:4 - 45+2  Trossard (Odegaard), 0:5 - 63  Saka (Odegaard), 0:6 - 65  Rice (White)Cards: Alvarez (9), Areola (38), Kudus (76), Phillips (90+1)BOOMERANG.BETN1BETMEGAPARIPARIPESATIPICO888 STAKE BOOMERANG.BETPIN UPPOKERSTARSSportsbooksCasinoBest bookmakersLoading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...All bookmakers",https://tribuna.com/en/news/arsenal-2024-02-09-can-west-ham-do-the-double-vs-arsenal-chris-sutton-predicts-outcome-of-sundays-clash/,Georgy Tzepkovsky,2024-02-09T12:00:00.000Z,BBC Sports
10565,RB Leipzig vs Manchester City: Prediction and Preview,"Pep Guardiola’s team have lost two consecutive matches and now face another tough test, this time in the Champions League. We look ahead to the game with our data-powered RB Leipzig vs Manchester City prediction and preview. Pep Guardiola was banned from the touchline at the weekend and could only watch on in frustration as Manchester City suffered a second straight defeat. A UEFA Champions League test away to RB Leipzig on Wednesday offers his team an immediate chance to respond after their stunning start to the 2023-24 season came to an abrupt halt in matches against Newcastle United and Wolves. Man City had won six straight Premier League games, triumphed in the UEFA Super Cup and dispatched Crvena Zvezda to kick off their UCL campaign since losing the Community Shield to Arsenal. But with Rodri suspended after the midfielder’s sending off against Nottingham Forest, the treble winners have shown some vulnerability just as many of their rivals were starting to wonder if there really was a way to stop them. Newcastle battled to a 1-0 win to dump City out of the EFL Cup and three days later Wolves earned a shock 2-1 EPL victory over the defending champions at Molineux with Guardiola sitting in the stands. Man City will look to put those losses behind them and move a step closer to a place in the last 16 with a positive result against RB Leipzig, though they could have done with an easier fixture to get back on track, as this looks like the toughest of the six matches they have in Group G. It should be a difficult assignment away to the Bundesliga side – who are by now familiar foes – as Leipzig continue to impress under Marco Rose. Since Rose’s appointment just over a year ago, Leipzig have only lost six of 30 matches in the Bundesliga, won a second straight DFB-Pokal crown and defeated Bayern Munich in the DFL-Supercup. They come into this contest having scored in 16 straight matches. Bayern were again their opponents on Saturday, this time in league action, and Leipzig raced into a two-goal lead after strikes from Loïs Openda and Castello Lukeba, although second-half responses from Harry Kane and Leroy Sané for the German champions meant Rose’s team ultimately had to settle for an entertaining 2-2 draw. Leipzig won 3-1 away to Young Boys in their UCL opener, so there has been no evidence so far to suggest pre-tournament predictions that these two teams would dominate the group will prove unfounded. It is the German team who go into the contest with more of a spring in their step, though Erling Haaland will hope to torment Leipzig once again and get the English champions back to winning ways. Haaland is the Premier League’s top scorer and Julián Álvarez is enjoying an impressive start to the 2023-24 season as well. The Argentina international struck against Wolves to make it three goals and three assists from his first seven EPL matches. And Álvarez also scored twice in the 3-1 comeback win against Crvena Zvezda to kick off the continental campaign, attempting eight shots and creating seven chances in a standout showing. He is expected to continue in the starting line-up with Haaland in attack at the Red Bull Arena, while in a relief to Guardiola, the influential Rodri should also return as his domestic suspension will not apply in Europe. Man City have played RB Leipzig as often as they have faced most of their domestic rivals over recent seasons. This is the third consecutive campaign where the two teams will do battle in the Champions League. Leipzig have fared well in the fixtures played on home soil, winning 2-1 two years ago and drawing 1-1 in the first leg of the two teams’ last-16 tie last season. However, Man City did emphatically turn that tie around at the Etihad Stadium in March, romping to a famous 7-0 second-leg win with Haaland scoring five times in a remarkable 35-minute spell. Kevin De Bruyne, who is injured for this encounter, was also on the scoresheet along with now-Barcelona midfielder İlkay Gündoğan. Haaland’s record against RB Leipzig is sensational. The former Borussia Dortmund striker has scored 11 goals in just six career appearances against them, netting more times than he has versus any other opponent while playing for top-flight clubs. In last season’s competition, the draw also saw Leipzig pitted against the Champions League holders. That time it was Real Madrid who were defending the trophy, and the 14-time winners fell to a 3-2 defeat in Germany. So this match gives the hosts an opportunity to become the first team since Atletico Madrid in 2015 and 2016 to earn a win over the competition holders in consecutive continental campaigns. Despite losing stars like Christopher Nkunku in the summer, Leipzig are in good form, with six wins and that draw with Bayern last time out to show from their last seven matches in all competitions since their defeat to Bayer Leverkusen in August. Starting with a 5-1 win over Stuttgart, Rose’s side have netted 20 times in total during that sequence, boosted by fast starts. They have scored the first goal in each of their last six fixtures, netting eight goals before half-time and conceding just twice prior to the break. Leipzig had two wins, one draw, and one loss in the four Champions League contests played at Red Bull Arena last season and against City they will attempt to prolong an eight-match home unbeaten streak in all competitions. They will also bid to start a UCL campaign with two straight wins for the first time. Openda has impressed in reaching four Bundesliga goals so far, while Xavi Simons has been key for Leipzig too with three goals and four assists in seven top-flight matches. Manchester City, meanwhile, have lost two straight away games but will take comfort from the fact they were unbeaten in their six European contests on the road last season. Group games rarely cause Man City a problem, with only two defeats in their last 30 such matches, although they have been held to 0-0 draws in three of their last seven away contests at this stage. German teams have not proven overly problematic either, as Man City have only lost one of their last 21 UCL games against Bundesliga opponents (which was the defeat to Leipzig in December 2021). City were a superb attacking force against Crvena Zvezda, setting a record for shots inside the box since Opta statistics have been recorded in that category from the 2003-04 competition onwards. They had a record 28 shots from inside the box and racked up 82 touches in the opposition penalty area, which was the most in a UCL game for a decade, since Bayern had 83 against Viktoria Plzen in 2013. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off on Wednesday, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta supercomputer is backing Manchester City to get back on track by defeating RB Leipzig. A Man City win is not a foregone conclusion and there are multiple other Champions League teams with higher win percentages than them on Matchday 2, but at 56.2% an away win is seen as the most likely outcome. RB Leipzig recording a victory is rated as a 20.9% chance, with the draw given a 22.9% likelihood in what could be a great contest between two of the top eight teams in the Opta Power Rankings. Looking at our predictive model’s tournament projections as whole, it is looking good for both teams. Manchester City are still strong favourites to win back-to-back UCL crowns, with their chance of lifting the trophy being 32.2%. For context, the next most likely winners, Bayern, are down at 13.1%. Guardiola’s men reach the final in almost half of our simulations (47.5%) and successfully emerge from Group G 99.1% of the time, beating Leipzig to first place in the pool at a rate of 78.3%. Leipzig were already dark horses to win the tournament in our system when we ran our pre-season predictions, rated as having a better chance than heavyweight clubs like Manchester United, Barcelona and Paris Saint-German after the group-stage draw was made. And their odds have only improved since then after a fine start to the season. With a 5.9% chance of going all the way, Leipzig are now fifth favourites and only rank behind Man City, Bayern, Arsenal (9.3%) and Real Madrid (7.3%), having jumped ahead of Napoli and Inter Milan. Leipzig make the last 16 in 93.9% of simulations and the last eight at a rate of 54.0%, so Man City should be prepared for a stern examination.

459,'I have a clear idea for Neymar' - New PSG boss Galtier calms down transfer talk for Brazilian star,"Christophe Galtier has confirmed that he wants Neymar to stay at Paris Saint-Germain, with the club's new head coach claiming to have a ""very clear idea"" of how to bring the best out of the Brazilian superstar. Former Lille manager Galtier inherited the managerial reins at Parc des Princes following Mauricio Pochettino's sacking on Tuesday morning. The Argentine paid the ultimate price for PSG's latest failure in the Champions League, which also sparked fresh rumours over Neymar's future at the club, but Galtier says that the 30-year-old will be central to his plans. GOAL has reported that PSG are ready to let Neymar go if they receive a suitable offer in the current transfer window, with the forward having largely failed to live up to his world-record €222 million (£191m/$228m) price tag since joining the club from Barcelona in 2017. A potential return to Camp Nou has been suggested for Neymar, while Premier League trio Chelsea, Manchester United and Newcastle have also been credited with an interest in his services, but Galtier doesn't want to see such a talented player walk through the exit doors. ""Neymar is a world-class player, what coach wouldn't want him in his squad. We have to find a balance in the team,"" the Frenchman said in his first press conference. ""I have a very clear idea of what I want from him. I haven't met him yet but I want him to stay with us."" Christophe Galtier is the new manager of PSG 🇫🇷 pic.twitter.com/LeAV97e5Fx Galtier also commented on Kylian Mbappe's decision to snub a transfer to Real Madrid in favour of signing a new three-year contract at Parc des Princes. The new PSG boss is glad that he will have the chance to work with the World Cup winner, but doesn't want him to become overburdened with responsibility due to his superstar status in Paris. ""As a Frenchman I am very happy that he is staying in France: it is good for our league and PSG. I have not had any exchange with him,"" Galtier said. ""I know what Kylian expects from the team. We know what he brings to the team. We must not give him all the weight of the result. ""He is a young player on whom I don't want to add pressure.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/neymar-psg-boss-galtier-calms-down-transfer-talk/blt7641194207737e7d,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8407,AFCON 2023: Ivory Coast reach semi-finals in dramatic fashion with win over Mali as South Africa edge past Cape Verde,"Oumar Diakit scored in stoppage time of extra time to send 10-man Ivory Coast into the semi finals of the Africa Cup of Nations with a dramatic 2-1 win over Mali. Simon Adingra had equalised with the host nation's first shot on target in the 90th minute to send it to extra-time, and Diakit completed a thrilling comeback by scoring in what was the 122nd minute of the game. It prompted wild celebrations among nearly 40,000 fans in the Stadium of the Peace in Bouak and beyond. Diakit was booked for excessive celebrations and was sent off as it was his second yellow card. He will miss the semi-final against DR Congo on Wednesday. Ivory Coast had been heading for a disappointing exit after Mali substitute Nene Dorgeles broke the deadlock with a brilliant strike from distance inside the top right corner in the 71st minute. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The home team had gone down to 10 men from the 43rd after Odilon Kossounou was sent off with his second yellow card for a tactical foul. Mali had early penalty appeals after a potential hand ball from Kossounou, but a VAR check found an offside infringement in the build-up. Transfer Centre LIVE!

It prompted more commitment from the home team, who had been outplayed, but Mali's defence largely coped with the Elephants' charge. Seko Fofana fired Ivory Coast's best chance over toward the end of the half, before Kossounou saw red for his tactical foul on Sinayoko.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  South Africa goalkeeper Ronwen Williams saved four penalties in the penalty shootout against Cape Verde to carry his country into the last four of the Africa Cup of Nations after a 0-0 draw in their quarter-final. Mothobi Mvala scored the decisive kick to make it 2-1 on penalties and win South Africa a semi-final place for the first time since 2000. But they were fortunate to get past the smallest nation in the tournament at Charles Konan Banny Stadium. It was a game full of missed opportunities but Cape Verde, who have a population of 600,000 but draw most of their players from a large diaspora in Europe, had most of the chances and were only denied a last-four place by the heroics of Williams.

1119,USMNT's Berhalter on Pulisic's improved Chelsea form: He can be the leader we expect him to be,"U.S. men's national team boss Gregg Berhalter reflected on Christian Pulisic's ""rollercoaster"" season so far at Chelsea while calling on the winger to be the leader the team needs heading into the final round of World Cup qualifiers. The U.S. heads into matches against Mexico, Panama and Costa Rica with its fate in its own hands as it looks to avoid missing out on a second consecutive World Cup. Berhalter's team enters camp with Pulisic in great form and the USMNT boss believes a confident Pulisic could be vital to the team's hopes this window. ""It's been a pleasure to watch,"" Berhalter said, ""and, I say this all the time, when I was asked about it last camp, I said it's a rollercoaster, especially when you're in a club like Chelsea. When you're at these massive clubs, it's very, very difficult.  ""All they ask him to do is just to keep fighting, keep working and wait for his opportunity and he's done that and he's taken advantage of it. He's become again an important part of their team. He's shown that he can step up and score goals and make assists. ""He's got a great knack for arriving in the penalty box and he's got a finishing touch too. He's very good when he's in front of goal.  ""So for us, we expect very similar things. He needs to keep arriving in the box because we know, when he gets in good positions, he scores, and just continue to focus on the basics and be the leader that we expect him to be."" While Pulisic entered January camp struggling for form, the Chelsea star is in a much better place this time around. He's scored three goals in his nine appearances since the last round of qualifiers, with two of those goals coming in the Champions League against Lille. As always, Pulisic is expected to be a key part of the USMNT squad, although the U.S. has plenty of options on the wing with the return of Gio Reyna. Tim Weah, Brenden Aaronson, Jordan Morris and Paul Arriola are also in the U.S. squad, with plenty of rotation expected across the three-game window.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/usmnt-berhalter-on-pulisic-chelsea-form-leader-we-expect-him/blt17f124b4e4b030e0,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10493,"Stat, Viz, Quiz 12: Villa’s Home Comforts, Neto the Nuisance and Barcelona’s xG Output","Stat, Viz, Quiz is the weekly Opta Analyst newsletter. Our latest edition includes numbers on Aston Villa, Pedro Neto and Barcelona’s expected goals. The sweet familiar sights, sounds and smells of domestic football, how we missed thee. If you’re an Aston Villa fan right now, it smells like team spirit as Unai Emery’s side put on another spectacular show at home to see off West Ham, and this week’s SVQ includes a look at just how difficult Villa have made it to visit the Midlands of late (that’s SVQ, not HS2). Elsewhere, we move not that far down the road to see what Wolves are up to, and one exciting winger in particular, while our quiz looks back at the weekend’s Premier League action. We also have an Ask Opta question that sends us over to La Liga in Spain, which will be a most welcome trip for those of us who have had to put up with the English weather in the last few days. The sun is shining on Aston Villa, though… (If you haven’t done so already, you can subscribe below and receive Stat, Viz, Quiz direct to your inbox every week)  Be honest, as Steven Gerrard’s Aston Villa were losing 3-0 at Fulham on a miserable Thursday night in October 2022, you would probably not have anticipated we’d be here 12 months later. That insipid defeat was the end of Gerrard’s reign, with Unai Emery coming in and transforming Villa not just into a better team, but one of the best in England. Only Manchester City have won more points (74) and games (24) than Villa in the year of 2023 (19 wins, 62 points), matching the points tally of Arsenal from the same number of games (31). The stat for this week is more about their home form, though, with their 4-1 hammering of West Ham on Sunday the latest in a run of wins at Villa Park that almost defies belief. Villa’s 11 Premier League home wins in a row is the third-best run in Europe’s big five leagues, with only Man City (14) and Atletico Madrid (13) on longer streaks. They still have a way left to beat the Premier League record for consecutive home wins, with Liverpool winning 24 on the bounce between February 2019 and July 2020. But they have looked so comfortable in dispatching Everton (4-0), Crystal Palace (3-1), Brighton (6-1) and West Ham (4-1) in their four league games at Villa Park this season, they’ll presumably give it a good go. Ollie Watkins will be key to that, having been directly involved in 26 goals in 33 appearances for Aston Villa in the Premier League since Emery’s first game (17 goals, 9 assists). Only Mohamed Salah (35) and Erling Haaland (33) have contributed more goals in the league in this time. Their next four home PL games see them host Luton, Fulham and then Man City and Arsenal. Even if they can’t maintain their record through that gauntlet, we haven’t seen someone so at home at the Villa since [insert reference to a pair of Love Island contestants canoodling]. Not to be outdone, Wolves might not be quite as successful as Villa right now, but they have a player their maroon and blue rivals might be jealous of (or at least, would be if it weren’t for Moussa Diaby). Pedro Neto has hit the ground running this season, achieving the deadly duo of both looking very dangerous and actually being very dangerous with it. After a couple of years blighted by injuries, the Portuguese winger is tearing it up in the Premier League this season, as we recently analysed ourselves. His assist for Matheus Cunha in Wolves’ 2-1 comeback victory at Bournemouth on Saturday was his sixth of the season, and fifth from open play, putting him outright top of the charts for open-play Premier League assists in 2023-24. Neto is ahead of the likes of Kieran Trippier, Mohamed Salah, Vladimir Coufal and Ollie Watkins, who are on four open-play assists each. The 23-year-old seems to have put his injury issues behind him and is leading the charge for a Wolves team under Gary O’Neil that finally seems to have teeth. They were the lowest scorers in the Premier League last season with 31 goals, whereas the season before, only the three relegated teams scored fewer than their 38, clearly missing Neto’s influence as he was absent for the majority of both campaigns. Wolves already have 11 in nine games, hardly a goal frenzy but they’re on course to score around 46 in total, with only 10 players across the league creating more than Neto’s 14 chances from open play so far (level with Bukayo Saka, Dominik Szoboszlai and Julián Álvarez). With Neto around, Wolves can look forward to a bright future, assuming of course that in the January transfer window… sorry Wolves fans, we’ll let you live in the moment a bit longer. On this week’s show, Matt Furniss and Graham Bell look at Aston Villa’s incredible run since Unai Emery took over at Villa Park and just why they are proving such a mouthwatering side to watch. Also, as part of our Premier League Review: Matchday 9 episode, the pair take a look at “The Good, The Bad and The Quirky” from the weekend’s action at both the top and the bottom of the table with rumours swirling of Andoni Iraola’s departure from strugglers Bournemouth. And then for our weekly quiz, David Segar becomes the latest to try and uphold the podcast guests’ stellar record, but could this FINALLY be the time for Graham to record a win? With domestic football back we thought we’d test your Premier League muscle (we’ve all got one), so this week’s quiz is mostly about the weekend’s top-flight action. Answers are at the bottom of the page. 1. After their 4-0 win over Crystal Palace, Newcastle United have scored 24 league goals this season. Their most since which campaign at this stage; A) 1994-95, B) 1995-96, or C) 1996-97? 2. Ashley Young’s red card for Everton against Liverpool made him the third-oldest player to be sent off in the Premier League (38 years, 104 days). Who is the oldest? (Clue: He had a nickname that suggested he was likely to be in the running for this ‘accolade’) 3. Erling Haaland’s goal from outside the box against Brighton was his 61st strike for Manchester City, but how many has he scored from outside of the penalty area? 4. Leandro Trossard came off the bench to equalise for Arsenal at Chelsea, making it five goals by subs for the Gunners this season. Who are the only Premier League team to have had more? 5. Our final question this week is in honour of Manchester United legend, the late, great Sir Bobby Charlton. Across his 106 caps, how many goals did the 1966 World Cup winner score for England? This week’s question came to us via email from José Ramón González, who asks: “I remember you mentioned Barcelona had a higher xG than goals scored. With that in mind, how are Barcelona doing this season compared to last season?” Do you have a stat-based question you’d like Opta to answer for you (and everyone else) in a future edition of SVQ? Email us at editors@theanalyst.com or message us on X @OptaAnalyst with #AskOpta and we’ll pick the best one. Answer: Barcelona are indeed slightly underperforming their expected goals (xG), with 21 goals from an xG of 22.9 (excluding own goals). Robert Lewandowski is out with a sprained ankle, so perhaps having him back would help? The Polish striker missed the 1-0 win over Athletic Club at the weekend, but it is hoped he will be fit for this weekend’s Clasico against Real Madrid. That said, Lewandowski is perhaps the epitome of why underperforming your xG doesn’t matter all that much. He was undoubtedly a key part of Barcelona’s title win last season, scoring 23 La Liga goals, but that came from 24.6 xG. Last season as a team, Barcelona scored 69 goals from 77.0 xG, so they have actually been very slightly more ruthless this season (underperforming by 0.19 per 90 as opposed to 0.21 per 90). Where Xavi’s side won the league in 2022-23 was at the other end, though, conceding just 17 goals (excluding own goals) from 34.0 xG. They have been less efficient at the back in 2023-24, though, conceding 10 goals from 9.9 xG. Whatever the numbers, Barcelona are mes que un xG.

1361,'He has done fantastic work at Ajax' - Man Utd star Ronaldo weighs in on Ten Hag arrival,"Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo has backed Erik ten Hag to impress once he takes up the reins at Old Trafford.  Ten Hag has already been appointed United's next permanent manager, a role he will assume once finishing the current season with Ajax.  His exploits with the Dutch giants have won him many admirers, including the legendary Portugal striker.  ""What I know about him is he did a fantastic job for Ajax, that he's an experienced coach, but we need to give him time,"" Ronaldo explained to United's official website.  ""Things need to change the way he wants. ""I hope we have success, of course, because, if you have success, all of Manchester is going to have success as well. I wish him the best. ""We are happy and excited, not only as players, but the supporters as well. ""I wish him the best and let's believe that, next year, we are going to win trophies."" Ten Hag takes over at a club desperate for silverware, especially the Premier League crown.  United last won the title in Sir Alex Ferguson's last season in charge back in 2012-13 and cannot finish higher than sixth this term, leaving them outside the Champions League.  Ajax, meanwhile, lifted their third Eredivisie title in four seasons under Ten Hag in 2021-22 and also reached the Champions League last 16, where they narrowly missed out to Benfica.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/he-has-done-fantastic-work-at-ajax-man-utd-star-ronaldo/blt7e692679469806bd,Daniel Edwards,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4227,"Dortmund will sign replacement for cancer-stricken Haller in next few days, says Watzke","Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has confirmed that the club will sign a replacement for Sebastien Haller as he continues his recovery from cancer. The former Ajax forward has been diagnosed with a testicular tumour, which turned out to be malignant, earlier in July and has already completed the first stage of his treatment.  Haller joined Dortmund from Ajax on a four-year deal worth a reported £27 million ($33m) earlier this summer. He was set to boost Edin Terzic's attack following the departure of Erling Haaland to Premier League champions Manchester City in May. Haller will be out for several months as he continues to recover from testicular cancer and Dortmund are looking into signing a short-term replacement. ""We said as long as we don't have a clear diagnosis, we have to keep the ball flat first. That's also a matter of respect for the boy,"" Watzke said in an interview with Sportschau.  ""But we have it now and of course, it's clear then that the downtime will be relatively long. ""Now dumping everything on Youssoufa Moukoko's shoulders, he's 17 years old, that might be a bit too much. We'll do something again in terms of personnel. Ideally, something should happen in the next eight to ten days."" Bsr tt le monde je tenais à vs informé que la 1er Étape a été accomplie!

The 35-year-old is a free agent but is reported to be demanding €10 million in wages, which might be a major stumbling block for Dortmund.  Anthony Modeste is another name that is doing the rounds. The Koln striker, who scored 20 goals in 32 appearances in Bundesliga last season, has reportedly been offered to BVB and the player is open to the switch. The likes of Mauro Icardi, Jhon Cordoba, Krzysztof Piatek, and Edin Dzeko have also been mooted as potential targets.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/dortmund-will-sign-replacement-cancer-stricken-haller-next/blt27bce6f5fbc5882f,Soham Mukherjee,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

11118,Cody Gakpo and the Return to a False-Nine System at Liverpool,"This was supposed to be a season of change for Liverpool.  The Reds parted with an initial £64 million in the summer to bring Darwin Núñez to Anfield.  Not only was it the first time that the Merseyside club had spent over £40m on an attacker but Darwin was also the first pure centre-forward signed by Jürgen Klopp.  His arrival was supposed to signify the end of the false-nine era at Anfield. After all, Darwin is the polar opposite of Roberto Firmino, the man who has spearheaded the Liverpool attack during the entirety of Klopp’s time at the helm.  Firmino is an entertainer who plays the game at his own pace. He is selfless, cunning and, on his day, mesmerising. Darwin, on the other hand, is raw, and robust. He plays as though it is a game of next goal winner.  There is a world in which these two players coexist in the same XI but with Firmino’s contract expiring at the end of the season and the injuries racking up for the experienced Brazilian, everything did seem to point towards Darwin being his replacement in attack. Not stylistically, of course.  Klopp has never been shy about praising the man the Uruguayan is replacing.   Following the 5-0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford last season, the German said: “I’m pretty sure people will write books about how he interpreted the false-nine position. I won’t say he invented it, but the way he plays it, it looks like it!” He has also been quoted as saying: “The way we played in the last few years was only possible because of Bobby.” But all good things come to an end. At the top level of football, you adapt or you perish. Liverpool had adapted some elements of their system over recent seasons with Diogo Jota coming in being used centrally while Luis Díaz played the left-sided attacking role differently to Sadio Mané.  This was the next evolution of the forward line at Anfield. Instead of the centre-forward dropping deep to link play, they would be the one looking to get in behind while others would adopt tweaked roles. Mohamed Salah, for example, had more of a creative brief as the Reds looked to bed Darwin in. The Reds altered their style and tried to go a little more direct on occasion. The more they forced it, the less control they had in matches. The midfield was being bypassed during offensive and defensive transitions so there was no solid base. As a result of this, Liverpool conceded a lot of chances and goals. They dropped a lot of points.  Heading into the January transfer window, many expected Klopp to reinforce the midfield yet just one signing was made.  Cody Gakpo.  Linked with Manchester United, Leeds and Southampton, the 23-year-old had impressed at the World Cup with the Netherlands. He was expected to leave PSV, but few foresaw a move to Anfield despite Pep Lijnders, Liverpool’s assistant manager, gushing over him in November. He was quoted as calling his compatriot “the missing link,” though he was referring to the national team at the time.  The move caught a lot of people off guard. The Reds didn’t need yet another left-sided attacker with Díaz, Jota, Fabio Carvalho and Darwin all capable of playing that role. In his first start for his new side, he played on the left of a front three against Wolves in the FA Cup with Salah on the right and Darwin leading the line.   Darwin was then ruled out with a hamstring injury and this saw Gakpo used centrally due to the injuries to Firmino and Jota. He’s been there ever since, even though everyone other than Díaz is now available for selection. Gakpo had played there on occasion for PSV, but the majority of his minutes arrived from the left while in Holland. Not long after his signing was announced, former Manchester United forward Robin Van Persie gave his thoughts on the young attacker.  “He is a good player. (Gakpo) always finds a way to have an influence. In terms of getting an assist or scoring a goal. He is always dangerous (but) not really an out-and-out striker. He can play as a No. 10, on the (left) wing, as a false striker or on the right wing. He has a good physique. He’s strong, fast and can dribble. An all-round player.” At the time, the entire system was built around ensuring the centre-forward for Liverpool was well-serviced.  It is no doubt one of the reasons why Darwin has been so impactful this season. He’s in the 99th percentile for attacking contribution (combining non-penalty shots with open-play chances created) in the Premier League. The fact that Van Persie highlighted Gakpo wasn’t an out-and-out striker was accurate but it was also confusing. It clashed with Liverpool’s style. The one they had been working toward all season. So why was he being used as the focal point?  It had quite clearly dawned on Klopp and his coaching team that this new approach required a blast from the past.  Liverpool had been operating with a front four when in possession. The wide forwards would hold the width, Darwin would occupy both centre-backs and then the plan was for one of the two box-to-box midfielders to push on and fill the spaces in between the centre-forward and the wide forward. The other would sit and create a double pivot with the defensive midfielder. However, this was fairly fluid and given the players weren’t yet well-versed in this shape – they didn’t have the reps done for it yet – it caused a lot of problems and created gaps that were regularly being exploited.  As detailed in a previous feature, this setup was a key reason behind Liverpool’s poor defensive numbers.  The blast from the past was a false nine.  Few envisaged Gakpo would play that role but in practice it makes sense. The Dutchman is a blend of Firmino and Darwin in the sense he’s technically brilliant, progressive and a competent progressor of the ball but he’s also very direct in his thought process. The 6-foot-4 forward can receive the ball to feet with his back to goal. He’s happy to link with the midfield but he also has the ability to turn and attack space.  Liverpool have kept a front-four approach when in possession but it has been altered. The centre-forward now drops deep to make up a secondary two with the right-sided midfielder behind the two wide forwards.  However, instead of holding their width, they are narrow and occupy all four defenders. You can see this shape in action in the two examples below.  First, against Everton. A tactic now for Liverpool is to go long and look to pick up the second balls with Gakpo having a significant role in this approach.  He can pick up possession and attack the space ahead of him with centre-backs reluctant to step up to press him due to the threat of Darwin and Salah in behind. The 23-year-old has been fairly influential since he arrived on Merseyside. Since his first appearance at the club, the PSV academy graduate actually ranks joint-third for attacking sequence involvements behind Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold. And both players have more minutes to their names. This is even more impressive when you consider he’s still learning the ropes at Anfield while playing in a new role.  Gakpo referenced this in an interview following the 7-0 win over Manchester United recently.  “Obviously I played a few games in the centre and more like a false nine to be involved in the build-up, and from there go forward. It’s another role that I’m used to, but it’s good for me to improve the position and keep working.” The shock 1-0 defeat to Bournemouth ended Liverpool’s five-match unbeaten run in the Premier League. However, during that run, the Reds kept five clean sheets, scored 13 goals and picked up 13 points. This run included tricky matches against Newcastle United and Manchester United. Liverpool won both matches. Gakpo starred as a false nine in both games. The 14-cap Dutch international scored the second against Newcastle to all but put that game to bed after only 17 minutes. He then scored twice in the historic win over the Red Devils. Both were top-level finishes, but what really caught the eye was how he was forever finding and creating space against United. It was very reminiscent of Firmino at his peak. He showed his intelligence and awareness to drift to the unoccupied left flank knowing the midfielders wouldn’t want to go out there before bursting into central areas to pick up the ball in the space between the defensive and the midfield lines. This new shape allows Salah and Darwin to get into dangerous areas while ensuring they have support. It also gives Liverpool a solid base as multiple players are no longer being tasked with occupying dual roles. The Reds have a double pivot protecting the backline and then have an extra two bodies backing up the press if the initial one fails.  Perhaps Klopp tried to move away from the false-nine tactic a little too abruptly. Since returning to it, Liverpool have looked a lot more functional as a unit. The Bournemouth result doesn’t change that.  Enjoy this? Subscribe to our newsletter to receive exclusive stories each Friday. It’s free.

1920,‘Power of Suarez and intelligence of Cavani’ – Liverpool new boy Nunez given big billing by former coach,"Liverpool have a £64 million ($79m) deal in place for Benfica striker Darwin Nunez, with the Reds informed by the Uruguayan’s former coach they are acquiring a Luis Suarez-Edinson Cavani hybrid in the 22-year-old. The Reds have fended off rival interest in the South American from arch-rivals Manchester United as questions continue to be asked of how long Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah will be around at Anfield as they enter the final 12 months of their contracts. Now the man who handed a hot prospect his senior debut at Penarol is suggesting another Uruguayan sensation can emulate the efforts of illustrious countrymen. Leonardo Ramos, who handed Nunez his bow at 18 years of age, told La Pagina of a frontman following in Suarez’s footsteps in linking up with Liverpool: “He has a similar style to Cavani, but it seems to me that Darwin is faster and more powerful. “He is much more explosive and apart from that explosiveness he obviously showed incredible goal scoring ability. He has two parts, he is half and half between Suarez and Cavani. “He has the power that Suarez had to go for it all, to go to the clash and fight with the rival. He also has the part of Cavani, of being a much more athletic player, more physical, more intelligent. “I think he is a combination of those two things.” The way Darwin Nunez had Liverpool dancing 🕺 pic.twitter.com/QTNlTm3Wla The deal Liverpool have put in place for Nunez could be worth as much as £85 million ($104m), with various add-ons included. They are investing in his potential on a long-term basis, with it expected that a six-year contract will be signed on Merseyside. Suarez made his own move to Liverpool in January 2011 and went on to register 82 goals for the Reds in 133 appearances. He carried Liverpool agonisingly close to the Premier League title in 2013-14 – his final season at the club before heading off to Barcelona – with the prestigious PFA Player of the Year award also secured.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/power-suarez-intelligence-cavani-liverpool-nunez/blt91311e9d063aa87f,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1431,Barcelona's Aubameyang makes El Clasico history with brace in Real Madrid thrashing,"Barcelona striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has become the first player to score in five successive games against Real Madrid in the 21st century after notching a brace in Sunday's El Clasico. The Gabon captain steered Xavi's men to a shocking 4-0 victory over La Liga leaders with his contribution of two goals and an assist. Aubameyang broke the deadlock for the visitors at the Santiago Bernabeu with his 29th-minute effort, from an Ousmane Dembele assist. The 2015 African Footballer of the Year later turned up with an assist for Ferran Torres to make it 3-0 for Barcelona in the 47th minute, quickly followed by his second goal of the night to make it 4-0 in the 51st minute and seal the points. He was in action for 71 minutes before he was replaced by Memphis Depay. With his contribution on Sunday, Aubameyang is the first player to be directly involved in three goals in his first El Clasico appearance in all competitions in the 21st century. The 32-year-old who moved to Camp Nou on a free transfer from Arsenal in January, has now scored seven goals in seven league games for the Blaugrana while his overall tally across all competitions is nine goals in 11 appearances. The triumph leaves Barcelona unmoved in the Spanish top-flight table as they occupy the third spot with 54 points after 28 matches, three points behind second-placed Sevilla and 12 points behind leaders Real Madrid. After the international break, Aubameyang and his Barcelona teammates will aim to extend their 13-game unbeaten La Liga run when they host Sevilla for their next fixture on April 3.

11869,Season Snapshot: The Key Analytical Storylines From The Premier League So Far,"With 70 games played, we’re already 18% of the way through the 2021-22 Premier League season. As we ramp up for the return of Premier League football, we take a closer look at how the teams are shaping up this year. With the most recent game of Premier League football being played on the same day as the 2021 London Marathon, it seems topical to look at some of the physical statistics from the season so far. Ethiopia’s Sisay Lemma won this year’s men’s race, running 42.2km in 124 minutes. How does this compare to the athletes in the Premier League? Well, the average outfield player that played the full 90 minutes in a game this season ran 10.0km. If Lemma ran at his marathon winning pace for 90 minutes, he would run 30.6km. Over the season so far, Leeds United’s Jack Harrison is 108 metres short of running the marathon distance in 363 minutes. Liverpool’s Roberto Firmino has run for one minute longer than the Ethiopian but has only covered 17.8km (or 24.4km less). Neither are comparable, but both are interesting, nonetheless. The marathon man of the season, West Ham United’s Tomas Soucek, has covered 80.7km on the pitch so far, more than any other Premier League player and just shy of the distance of two marathons (1.91 marathons if you were interested). The marathon team of the season is none other than Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds United. In seven games this season, they have run over 18 marathons as a team (764km).  Not only do they cover the most distance, but they do so with incredible intensity. Leeds players have made 1,210 sprints, 21% more than the second-ranked team Southampton (997). As with a lot of statistics, physical stats are very stylistic. Running faster and further isn’t always better. One player who has become more efficient with his runs is 36-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo. We can look at his off-ball runs since he re-joined Manchester United, where an off-ball run is defined as a sustained off-ball movement, made with intensity, in order to receive a pass or create space while their team is in possession. 46% of Ronaldo’s off-ball runs in the Premier League this season have been into the box – the highest percentage of any striker in the division. Adapting to his new role leading the line for Manchester United, Ronaldo has two of the four highest game totals for off-ball runs into the box (17 vs. Aston Villa and 16 vs. Newcastle United). Of the 315 outfield players to have played at least 90 minutes this season, 261 of them have run further per minute played than Ronaldo. Run smart, not far. Pressing is part of the footballing vocabulary for even the most casual football fans these days. It’s frequency and effectiveness can be measured by a number of different advanced metrics which we will look at here. One way we can measure pressing is by looking at the number of individual pressures applied by players within a game. A pressure is defined here as a defensive action in which a player, whose team is out of possession, moves to close down an opposing player. Pressure may be applied to players in possession or potential receivers. By simply aggregating these pressures on a team basis, the results may initially be surprising. Brentford have applied the most pressures in the Premier League this season (3,968), while Manchester City have applied the fewest (2,694). However, we know that opportunities to pressure their opponents will vary between teams depending on how long they have the ball for. Another way to frame these numbers is to look at where these pressures are applied. By splitting the pitch into three thirds, we now see a much more predictable pattern emerge with the teams. Manchester City apply a higher proportion of their pressures in the final third than any other team in the Premier League (29%). This is 11.8% above the league average (in absolute terms). This shows that when they do pressure the opposition, Pep Guardiola’s team often do so in advanced areas of the pitch. The team that applies the lowest proportion of their pressure in the final third is Newcastle United. Across the Middle Eastern border of ownership, Steve Bruce cares not for the Gegenpress or Pep Guardiola’s famous five-second recovery rule. Only 9% of Newcastle’s pressures are applied in the final third, with the Magpies showing a greater tendency to sit deep and absorb attacks until the opportunity arises to release the magical feet of Allan Saint-Maximin. These pressure numbers give us a good idea of the quantity of pressures, but we also want to know how effective they were. Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool rank best in a metric called PPDA. PPDA measures the number of passes the pressing team allows relative to the number of defensive actions they make in advanced areas. A lower figure indicates a greater disruption to the opposition’s ability to pass in the build-up to the final third. Not every press is the same though. Sean Dyche’s Burnley top the rankings for high turnovers (73), a metric that measures how often a team wins possession in open play within 40 metres of the opponent’s goal line. This is likely to be testament to their ability to win second balls in advanced areas of the pitch. Although these numbers are not adjusted for possession, Burnley press in good company, closely followed in the rankings by Liverpool (70) and Brighton and Hove Albion (62), two teams lauded for their effective pressing strategies this season. Let’s finish with the basics. Passing is one of the fundamental building blocks in a game of football. Some choose to do less of it, and some choose to do more, but they all have to do it. Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City are renowned for dominating possession in games, averaging 63.8% possession in the Premier League this season (the highest of any side). We can see in the team style plots for the Premier League, posted first on The Analyst Twitter channel, how this extreme style reflects in their sequences too. They progress the ball upfield slowly, at a rate of 1.3 metres per second, and average 4.8 passes per sequence. Graham Potter’s Brighton look similar in this high-level comparison and, together with Liverpool and City, make up only three teams to record over 100 sequences containing 10+ passes. But passing without end product is futile. Despite Brighton recording such a high number of sequences of this length, only 14% of them have ended with a touch in the opposition box or a shot. Only Leeds United (9%) and Brentford (3%) have converted a smaller percentage into such advanced opportunities. Manchester City and Chelsea’s ruthlessness is illustrated with their ability to convert theirs, sharing a league-high 31% conversion rate of turning these long possessions into a touch in the opposition box or a shot. Liverpool, the third of the original passing trio, have gone one step further and managed to convert four of these build-up phases to goals, two more than second-ranked Chelsea. The two sequences that contained the most passes and finished with a goal were both scored by Liverpool this season. Mohammed Salah’s 54th-minute goal against Brentford and Sadio Mane’s 92nd-minute goal against Leeds United both ended sequences containing 22 passes. Passing with end product is not futile.

6605,Worry for Super Eagles as Ndidi limps off with injury in Leicester City defeat,"Wilfred Ndidi picked up an injury as Leicester City suffered a 2-1 loss to Rennes in the second leg of their Uefa Europa Conference League on Thursday. Ndidi tried to tackle Gaetan Laborde for the ball but he injured himself in the process and was substituted immediately for James Maddison in the 60th minute. Meanwhile, Wesley Fofana's consolation goal in the 51st minute was enough to help the Foxes advance into the quarter-final stage despite goals from Benjamin Bourigeaud and Flavien Tait for the hosts at the Roazhon Park. A week ago, Leicester City sealed a 2-0 win over the French Ligue 1 side and it helped them advance with a 3-2 aggregate result. The extent of Ndidi’s injury is yet to be known but it appears to be around the medial ligament in his knee. “Wilfred Ndidi is a block tackle, so he injured the medial ligament in his knee so will see how that is,” Rodgers said after the game. Ndidi's injury comes as a worry for Brendan Rodgers and Nigeria coach Austin Eguavoen. The 25-year-old is among the key players in the Foxes' set-up with 31 appearances across all competitions so far this season. On the international scene, Ndidi has been invited for Nigeria's crucial 2022 Fifa World Cup qualifying games against Ghana. Thursday’s setback leaves his availability in doubt as the three-time African champions chase a World Cup ticket against Ghana. Ndidi played every minute of the Super Eagles’ games at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations where they were knocked out by Tunisia in the Round of 16.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/worry-for-super-eagles-as-ndidi-limps-off-with-injury-in/blt774b3a67463dc5e0,By Taiye Taiwo,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5620,"McKennie's revival, transfer chaos and five things to watch in the USMNT's January World Cup qualifiers","In his opening comments during Friday's press conference, Gregg Berhalter admitted that this next set of World Cup qualifiers were coming at a weird time. But such is the world we now live in, with the Covid-19 pandemic having turned CONCACAF's qualifying cycle into a chaotic sprint towards the finish line in Qatar. Over the next week or so, the U.S. hosts El Salvador in Columbus, the team's spiritual home, before heading north of the border to face a dangerous Canada team.  And then they wrap up against Honduras in Minnesota, in a game that threatens to conjure up memories of the infamous Snow Clasico against Costa Rica, with that match in particular promising freezing temperatures that will border on inhumane. To navigate that window, Berhalter has called in 28 players, and there's a chance he'll have to use many of them in the difficult days to come. However, with two or three wins, the U.S. will all but assure their spot in Qatar. On the flip side, with two or three bad results, that path gets much more perilous. So, here's a look at some of the factors that will define this crucial round of World Cup qualifiers for the USMNT... When a young player makes a mistake, all you can ask for is that they acknowledge it and learn from it. Weston McKennie has done just that, with the midfielder in the form of his life just a few months after his big life lesson. Heading into this camp, McKennie has blossomed into a key player for Juventus, becoming an all-action, box-to-box midfielder, one that is changing games on both the defensive and attacking ends for a team that is still far, far away from the peak of its powers. After a dire start to the season, the resurgent Bianconeri are now up to fifth in the Serie A standings, with their American dynamo having scored goals in consecutive games earlier this month. Things could have gone either way for McKennie following his dismissal for violating USMNT rules, so he deserves credit for having taken his game to another level. ""He's playing at a really, really high level and that's good to see as we move into qualifiers,"" Berhalter said. ""I think that, again, if we have to revisit this, when it happened (his expulsion), it was a momentary lapse. It wasn't a reflection of his character, who he is, and I think that the treatment he got from the outside world was a little bit too harsh. ""We know Weston. We know he's a good guy. He cares for his teammates, he cares for the team, he cares for United States soccer and, for him, it was a matter of just getting refocused and bouncing back."" McKennie sure has bounced back and, because of that, there may not be a more exciting player to watch in action for the U.S. right now. It's been nearly four months since Gio Reyna has played in a match for the USMNT, as the Borussia Dortmund star remains out with a hamstring injury. In years past, that absence would have been catastrophic. Reyna is legitimately a world-class talent, a player that can play at the highest level right now, rather than one for the future.  Ask Borussia Dortmund how important Reyna is, and they'll almost certainly tell you that their season would look much, much different with the American playmaker in the lineup. However, while the Germans are already out of the Champions League, and six points behind Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich, Ryen's absence hasn't been felt too much by Berhalter's side, which is testament to the depth of the U.S. player pool. Brenden Aaronson has stepped into Reyna's role and arguably even made it his own. As rumors swirl around the RB Salzburg star's future, he looks set to be a key figure once again despite the fact that he may not be fully match fit due to the break in his club season. As things stands, though, the U.S. has plenty of attacking options, with Aaronson, Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah all playing big roles so far this cycle. Add in Paul Arriola and Jordan Morris and you have an overwhelming amount of attacking firepower. So, the U.S. won't be too worried about Reyna's absence, at least for this month. But the hope is that, next month, the Dortmund star can rejoin what is an incredibly strong group of wide players. When John Brooks was left out of the USMNT's rosters during the last international break, Berhalter said it was down to form. Brooks would be back, Berhalter insisted, but, at the time, he needed to play his way back into the picture. It appears that not much has changed in the months that have followed because, for the second time in as many windows, the Wolfsburg star isn't in the USMNT squad. ""He has the opportunity to play a role with us in the future,"" Berhalter said of his decision to leave out Brooks once again and instead call upon Miles Robinson, Walker Zimmerman, Mark McKenzie and Chris Richards, who are beginning to look like the chosen quartet for Qatar. ""We decided based on how we're looking at these games, and the strengths of our opponents, that he wouldn't be the best fit for this particular window. We're hoping that he regains his form for Wolfsburg and that they can start winning games to move up the table. ""So, this isn't stuff that's written in stone. Just because a player is not in this camp, it doesn't mean he doesn't have a future with the program."" But the question remains: what is Brooks' future with this program? If Brooks isn't a fit for these games, which games is he a fit for? He's one of few players left in the pool with World Cup experience and, for years, he was one of the first names on the team sheet. However, Robinson is now the USMNT's go-to centerback, while Zimmerman has replaced Brooks as the veteran asked to lead the way. McKenzie and Richards are only going to get better, making it harder and harder for Brooks to earn his way back into a meaningful role. Have we seen the last of Brooks in a USMNT shirt? Probably not. Can he still play a part in this qualifying campaign and, possibly, in the World Cup? Most definitely. But it appears that Brooks is falling further and further behind as the USMNT heads towards the last few hurdles on the road to Qatar. Last window, Berhalter truly showed his faith in Ricardo Pepi by bringing him in as the only out-and-out striker in the squad. He's made a similar statement this time around, selecting Pepi and veteran Gyasi Zardes as the striker unit.  If the message wasn't clear before, it is now: Pepi is the USMNT's No.9. The newly-signed Augsburg star is still just a few months into his international career, but he's already leading the race for that World Cup starting spot. Although he hasn't scored in any of the USMNT's last five matches, Pepi's clearly Berhalter's guy. So, there's no room in the current squad for Daryl Dike, who is now dealing with an injury at West Brom, or Josh Sargent, who is finally off the mark at Norwich with two very good goals. Matthew Hoppe and Jordan Pefok didn't make the cut either. This is a big and bold move by Berhalter, who could easily pick Pepi to lead the line in all three qualifiers, though could also turn to Zardes, or even someone like Weah or Morris, should the need arise. But Pepi remains the key man, and his ability to control play up top will likely be key to the success of this window. At least a half-dozen USMNT players have been linked with moves in recent weeks. Several others, like Ricardo Pepi, Kellyn Acosta and Sebastian Lletget, have recently changed clubs.  So, with the January window heading into its final weeks, there's a chance that a USMNT player or two could be on the move as part of a life-changing transfer. It remains to be seen if Aaronson heads to Leeds or Matt Turner gets a move to Arsenal. Sergino Dest's future remains very much up in the air. McKennie has been linked to Tottenham in recent weeks, while Miles Robinson's future remains a talking point in Atlanta. You can also add in DeAndre Yedlin, who has been linked to both the Championship and with an MLS return. That's a lot of outside noise leading up to a big run of games. ""It's important to support the players, to listen to the players,"" Berhalter said. ""I'm always here to help them and to have a conversation.  ""I look at my role as a sounding board rather than someone that's trying to influence any type of player movement or where they go. I just want to support them and hear from them and perhaps offer some advice and that's about it.  ""But I think as players as professionals, so they're used to compartmentalizing it and saying 'Okay, this is my focus now and then, when I'm off the field, I can move some focus into this area.' ""I understand that there are transfer rumors with some of our guys and that's part of it. That's always going to be part of it.  ""But our greater goal and our goal as a group is to qualify for the World Cup, and we're going to be extremely focused on that in this window.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mckennie-transfers-five-things-watch-usmnt-january-world-cup/blt748d0efbca1c12da,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8147,Nico Williams âvery gratefulâ to Athletic Club amid interest from Chelsea and Arsenal,"Athletic Club winger Nico Williams continues to make strides forward in his career, becoming one of the most difficult forwards in Spain to deal with this season. Despite signing a new contract just over two months ago though, he continues to be linked with a move this summer.  Chelsea and Arsenal are the latest to be mentioned in conjunction with the 21-year-old, with plenty of rumours that Williams has a â¬50m release clause in his new deal, giving him control over his future. While there will likely be interest from elsewhere, Matteo Moretto has told The Daily Briefing that Williams is both happy in Bilbao, and grateful to Athletic for their investment in him. If a giant does come in for him, it will not be easy to convince him to leave Los Leones. Williamsâ continues to be a nightmare for defenders in La Liga, and with the premium continuing to rise on players that can beat their defender with the ball at their feet, if he continues on this trajectory, his path will very much be his to choose. Given the strong connection between Athletic players and the club, it would be no surprise to see him hold off an exit for another year or two.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Nico-Williams-%E2%80%98very-grateful%E2%80%99-to-Athletic-Club-amid-interest-from-Chelsea-and-Arsenal/3300380,,12-Feb,all-football-app
1833,'We both won so let's go!' - Arteta ready to face Tottenham challenge as Arsenal look ahead to vital north London derby,"Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has backed his side to pip north London rivals Tottenham to fourth place as the battle to qualify for the Champions League looks to go all the way. The Gunners were briefly leapfrogged by Spurs after Antonio Conte’s side beat Leicester earlier on Sunday, but Arteta’s team responded with a 2-1 win at West Ham to end the weekend back in fourth. Arsenal are two points clear of Tottenham with four games remaining, with one of those fixtures a pivotal north London derby at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on May 12. Arsenal were far from their fluid best at London Stadium, but goals in each half from centre-backs Rob Holding and Gabriel were enough to secure all three points. It was also enough to guarantee a return to continental competition of some description next season, though Arteta is aiming for a spot in the Champions League. “You have to find a way to win and today we won ugly,” Arteta told BBC Sport. “We have to recognise that is the way we had done it. “We showed incredible spirit because when we could play the way we wanted to play we had to find a way to play the way they prefer. We adapted. You have to find a way to win all the time - forcing mistakes, being brilliant, digging in, clean sheets. “I am really happy, especially for Rob Holding as he hasn’t played the amount of minutes he deserves. He was man of the match today. He is always there when we need him."""" Asked whether the race for the top four could go all the way, the Spaniard added: “Let’s see. Another seven days to prepare for the match. The pressure is there and we both won so let’s go.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arteta-tottenham-challenge-arsenal-north-london-derby/blt578c4f5c8574c1d1,Tom Mallows,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10404,Wonderfully Imperfect Chelsea Are The Premier League’s Most Entertaining Team,"Chelsea have had a mixed start to life under Mauricio Pochettino, but as Sunday’s 4-4 draw with Manchester City showed, they are a very good watch right now. The madness of Chelsea’s summer transfer business has translated almost perfectly into on-pitch performances. Entertainment is now the name of the game. Having spent big in the summer on half a new squad, it wasn’t really a surprise that they started this season slowly. With a new manager also in place and so many new players who had to get used to playing together, this was always a project that needed time. Now, they are 10th in the table, with four wins from their 12 games, and their only victory in the last four games coming against a self-destructive nine-man Tottenham. But more than ever before in the Todd Boehly era, it feels like things are looking up at Stamford Bridge. Even if by “looking up” we simply mean that the fans are now at least getting their money’s worth. Sunday’s wonderfully entertaining 4-4 draw with Manchester City saw Mauricio Pochettino’s side edge into the top half of the Premier League table for only the third time in his reign (also 10th after three and nine games), and it’s only goal difference that makes their record better than 11th-placed Brentford. But Chelsea aren’t – right now at least – the all-conquering, trophy-winning machine that they have been for much of the past two decades. Expectations have shifted. Good results would obviously be nice – and the City draw, as well as that win over Spurs and the draw with Arsenal a couple of weeks prior were definitely that – but results aren’t the be-all and end-all right now. Chelsea have become the best team to watch in the Premier League in recent weeks, and whether they are winning or not, that should be considered a positive for the supporters who endured a rough 2022-23. We have previously analysed the underlying numbers of Chelsea’s current season on these pages to show that their performances deserved a higher league position than they were actually occupying, and since that piece was written, they have snuck four places up the standings. (They should still be fourth according to our expected points table, by the way.) Even the most optimistic of Chelsea fans would still see the imperfections in the team, and the best anyone is realistically expecting of Chelsea this season is a cup run and a challenge for the European positions. Already 10 points off the top four, it would be a hell of a recovery if they were to get back into the Champions League (though the possibility of fifth being enough to qualify for the competition raises those chances significantly). But for the time being, it should all be about enjoying the wild, wild ride that is watching Chelsea play. Sunday’s classic against City was one of the most exciting matches we have seen in recent years. It was only the fifth game in the entire Premier League era to see four equalising goals scored (along with Everton vs Leeds in October 1999, Charlton vs West Ham in November 2001, Tottenham vs Reading in December 2007, and Liverpool vs Arsenal in April 2009). A match as topsy-turvy as this one hadn’t come along in pushing 15 years. The game produced more expected goals (5.83) than any other in the Premier League this season, as well as the joint-most actual goals alongside Newcastle’s 8-0 win at Sheffield United, which was entertaining in a rather different, you-want-to-look-away-but-can’t sort of way. It was a brilliantly entertaining, end-to-end game, which was largely the result of Chelsea looking to go toe-to-toe with superior opposition. Many other teams would prefer to sit back against City, let them have the ball and simply crowd their own defensive third of the pitch so much that City find it hard to break through. It is a tactic that has worked for some teams – see Wolves’ hugely effective sit-back-and-counter approach in their 2-1 win at Molineux in September – but playing City always comes with the very real possibility of getting torn to shreds. When they are at their best, they can put five past anyone without reply. But Chelsea took inspiration from Arsenal’s 1-0 win over City last month and took the game to Pep Guardiola’s side. City had a relatively low (for them) 54.8% share of possession, with Chelsea looking to disrupt their passing game by pressing high up the pitch. They made more pressures on the ball (244) than in any of their games so far this season, while their nine high turnovers (regains made within 40m of the opposition’s goal line) were the second most any team has managed against City in 2023-24. They turned the game into a far more chaotic affair than City would have liked. They prefer to control matches and set the tempo with their passing, but they couldn’t manage that on Sunday. After the game, City midfielder Rodri praised Chelsea for making the match a game of transitions. “We played what they want,” he said. “They want to play quick transitions and they have better players, the better team in that situation. They have faster players, stronger, we have another type of players. We have to move the game to our sight, try to play our game and I think we will struggle.” The ball was changing hands so much that City were forced into making more defensive actions (32), more pressures (214) and more pressures in the final third (113) than they have in any Premier League game this season. Their own passing game suffered, too, as they only managed to piece together 12 passing sequences of 10 or more passes – their fewest in a Premier League game in 2023-24. City just could not dominate the game in the way they usually do, meaning they could not rest while they knocked the ball about at the back, and were much more frantic when in possession. It made for a very different game to the kind we’ve become accustomed to seeing them involved in, and a much more compelling watch, as a result. The action at either end was relentless. Chelsea had 17 shots, which was two more than City managed and the second-most City have allowed their opponents to have in a Premier League game since the start of the 2021-22 season. The game in which their opponents had more shots than that was a 1-1 draw at Brighton in May at the end of last season, when the title had already been wrapped up and Guardiola rotated his team ahead of their two imminent cup finals. Chelsea might even have got more than a point from this game. They went ahead at one stage (though they could only hold onto their lead for nine minutes) and beat City in the xG charts (2.95 to 2.88). There was plenty that Chelsea did wrong at the other end of the pitch, but it all only added to the entertainment. Marc Cucurella might have been more street-smart in dealing with Erling Haaland in the box before giving away the early penalty, and he arguably shouldn’t have been left alone to deal with the Norwegian in the first place.  They were slow to get out to the short corner that led to Manuel Akanji’s free header in the middle of the penalty area from which he scored City’s second, and Thiago Silva’s attempted block of Rodri’s shot was meek, so he wasn’t entirely blameless in deflecting the ball into his own net to make it 4-3 to City. It all added up to a fantastic spectacle, and the kind of excitement that we have come to expect of this Chelsea team of late. After this result, their last five Premier League games have produced 24 goals – more than any other team in that time, just ahead of City (22). There are still plenty of problems for Pochettino to fix. Sunday’s result means they have won just one of their seven league games at Stamford Bridge this season, their joint-fewest after seven home matches in a league campaign. Just two weeks before this match, of course, they were losing in embarrassing fashion at home to Brentford. But it is starting to appear increasingly like those underlying numbers were right: Chelsea really are better than their league position suggests. And even if results don’t improve much and they stay stuck in mid-table, it’s a hell of a good watch right now.

645,"West Ham vs Chelsea: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Premier League leaders Chelsea make the short trip across the capital on Saturday afternoon for a London derby against fierce rivals West Ham. The Hammers will be looking to get back to winning ways after three league games without a victory while Thomas Tuchel's men aim to continue their superb away form which has seen them pick up 19 points from a possible 21 on the road. West Ham have won three of their last six home games against Chelsea in the league and bet365 offer the hosts at 4/1 (5.00). Chelsea, meanwhile, are available at 8/11 (1.73) to claim their seventh away win of the campaign with the draw priced at 11/4 (3.75). Mason Mount opened the scoring in midweek at Watford and the England international is available at 9/2 (5.50) to break the deadlock on Saturday, the same price as Kai Havertz. Romelu Lukaku is the shortest priced player to score first, available at 3/1 (4.00), while the favourite to score first for the Hammers is Michail Antonio at 8/1 (9.00). Elsewhere for the hosts Tomas Soucek, who opened the scoring in midweek against Brighton, is priced at 16/1 (17.00) to do so once more, while Pablo Fornals, who has scored four times this season, is offered at the same price. Only the three teams above them in the table have scored more goals than fourth-placed West Ham this season and David Moyes' men have found the back of the net with impressive consistency. The side from the east of the capital have scored in all seven of their home league matches and, despite Chelsea boasting the division's best defensive record, West Ham will be confident of scoring once more. The Blues have conceded in three of their last four domestic clashes, and the likes of Watford, Burnley and Southampton have all netted against Chelsea this term. Both teams to score is priced at 19/20 (1.95) which looks like a healthy price given the scoring record of the hosts. Odds correct at the time of writing. Please gamble responsibly.

5311,Chelsea remain keen on USMNT goalkeeper Slonina but face Real Madrid competition,"Gabriel Slonina will soon make a decision on his future, with Chelsea and Real Madrid interested in signing the Chicago Fire goalkeeper.  The 18-year-old had come close to signing for the Blues in March but sanctions on former club owner Roman Abramovich caused the deal to collapse.  It has seen Madrid enter the fray as a contender for his signature, and a decision is expected to be made within the next fortnight.  Europe’s superpowers have been watching Slonina since he became the youngest starting goalkeeper in the United States’s top league at just 17 years and 81 days old.  Since then, he has made 25 senior appearances and has just turned 18, allowing him to move to the United Kingdom due to his joint-US and Polish nationality.  That duel nationality meant he was at the heart of a battle for his future eligibility with Poland calling him up for the upcoming Nations League matches.  In a statement, the Addison, Illinois-born shot stopper explained why he would opt to play for his country of birth. ""Being Polish means being extremely hard working, having faith, never taking no for an answer, pushing through hard times, and taking care of your family. I love everything about my heritage, from the people to the food, to the cities. I am also extremely grateful for being given the possibility to play for Poland,"" he said. ""With that being said, my heart is American. This country has given me and my family all the opportunities I could ask for. It’s pushed me and supported me through good and bad. ""I understand the privilege of wearing the badge, and the only time I’ll put my head down is to kiss it. America is home and that’s who I’m going to represent."" pic.twitter.com/CS6GXHUWwW Kepa Arrizabalaga could leave Chelsea and has been linked with a move to Newcastle, who appear to be targeting a new No 1. The Spain international has grown disillusioned at Stamford Bridge toward the end of the season, having been left out of cup matches despite playing in many of them last season.  The Blues will also have to make a decision on the future of Hull City loanee Nathan Baxter who earned rave reviews in the Championship.  The 23-year-old is keen to make it in west London but has only one year left on his contract and enters pivotal talks over his future.  ""I always do my best when I am sent out on loan and I want to put in the performances to show that I am good enough,"" Baxter told GOAL last month. ""It is my dream to play for Chelsea one day. Whether it is this summer or not, I don't know. They will bring me into the building and we'll have to wait and see. ""The next step could be going back to Hull, and why not? I love the place and the fans really supported me. Whatever the decision is, I will keep my head down and work as hard as I possibly can."" His future could well be impacted by any decision to sign Slonina, with Hull and West Brom among those interested.

6761,"When did Arsenal leave Highbury? Last game at iconic stadium, classic kit & move to the Emirates explained","Arsenal are one of the famous clubs in English football, with a stadium to match the biggest and best teams across the world. However, prior to their move into the vast surrounds of the Emirates Stadium, the Gunners made their home at Highbury, a ground that first opened in 1913 and could house just under 40,000 fans. GOAL takes a look back at Arsenal's last game at Highbury, the kit they wore and why the move to a new stadium happened. Arsenal left Highbury at the conclusion of the 2005-06 season, with the ground officially closing on May 7, 2006. The club left behind what was a 38,000-capacity stadium in order to move into the Emirates Stadium, a new, purpose-built state-of-the-art 60,000-seater venue. The last game Arsenal played at Highbury was a Premier League clash with Wigan Athletic on May 7, 2006. A Thierry Henry hat-trick complemented Robert Pires' opening goal to help the Gunners on their way to a 4-2 victory, allowing the club to bow out in style on a high note despite the Baggies' best efforts. Crucially too, Arsene Wenger's side clinched fourth place - and Champions League football - in the process, having bettered Tottenham's result against West Ham (Spurs lost 2-1). Pires fired Arsenal in front, but Wigan hit back through Paul Scharner before taking an unlikely lead when David Thompson's free-kick deceived Jens Lehmann. However, Henry sprung into action to rescue victory and ensure a memorable occasion for Gunners fans. ""For the history of the club and for this building here, to finish on a high I am very proud,"" reflected Wenger afterwards. ""We would all have felt guilty to have walked out of here on a low after what has happened here for years. There was fantastic excitement, strength of character and quality as well."" For Henry, it was a bittersweet moment, with rumours of the French striker's impending departure prompting Ashley Cole to joke that they would ""handcuff Thierry to keep him"" at the club. After the game, hat-trick hero Henry said: ""That was the perfect send-off."" The striker added: ""When I kissed the ground after my third, I was saying goodbye to this stadium."" As it turned out, Henry would remain at Arsenal for their maiden season at the Emirates before joining Barcelona in 2007. You can watch highlights of the game in the video above. Arsenal wore their 2005-06 burgundy (or redcurrant) home kit for their last game at Higbhury and it subsequently became known as the ""Highbury Farewell"" kit. Manufactured by Nike, the kit had a burgundy and gold colourway, with white shorts and burgundy socks being the preferred combination.  The 'O2' sponsor logo was gold and the jersey featured a large collar, with the Arsenal badge placed in the centre of the chest, rather than the left. Arsenal's move to the Emirates Stadium was driven chiefly by financial incentives, with the club seeking to maximise ticket sales in a time of sustained on-field success and meet the demand of a growing fanbase. Revenue is also generated through the hosting of concerts, with the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Coldplay performing at the venue, while Brazil have played a number of international exhibition games there. While the financial benefits of moving to a state-of-the-art stadium are clear, former boss Wenger has lamented that the club ""left their soul"" at Highbury.

""We built a new stadium but we never found our soul - we left our soul at Highbury. We could never recreate it for security reasons.

5920,Man Utd interim boss Rangnick claims credit for Liverpool success: 'Six or seven used to be my players',"Ralf Rangnick says he could claim some of the credit for the success enjoyed by Liverpool in recent years, with Manchester United’s interim boss pointing out he signed “six or seven” of the players currently starring at Anfield when “nobody knew them”. The German tactician is preparing to be reunited with those familiar faces on Tuesday with his current employers preparing for a testing Premier League trip to Anfield. Man Utd will have their work cut out against title-chasing rivals, with Jurgen Klopp boasting Sadio Mane, Naby Keita, Ibrahima Konate, Takumi Minamino, Roberto Firmino and Joel Matip on his books – who have all worked with Rangnick in the past. Rangnick, who inherited the reins at Old Trafford from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November 2021, has said of the challenge he faces when taking Man Utd to Merseyside: “They are good, they are extremely good. “""It's no coincidence that they're as good as they are. Jurgen has built that team over the last six-and-a-half years. Six or seven of those players used to be my or our players when we signed them for our clubs when nobody knew them. “It's no coincidence that this is probably the club with the highest number of players from our former clubs because their approach, their style of football, the way they want to play is pretty similar.” Rangnick 🇩🇪Klopp 🇩🇪Tuchel 🇩🇪Heavy metal football in the Premier League 🤘 pic.twitter.com/VGJaLxgxOj Rangnick was sporting director of the Red Bull group between 2012 and 2020, meaning he oversaw the development of a number of players now at Anfield.

11675,Looking Back: Arsène Wenger’s Arsenal,"The anniversary of his 1,000th Arsenal game is not one Arsène Wenger will remember too fondly, but his reign remains one to celebrate. From “Arsene Who” to “The Invincibles”, via all those things he did not see, Arsène Wenger brought a whole new lexicon to English football. He also changed the way the game is viewed in England, completely altering the horizons of a largely closed-off football culture to turbo-charge its transformation into the home of the most diverse, globally respected and richest domestic league on the planet. Wenger’s legacy in the Premier League is beyond question and compare and will continue to be celebrated on happier occasions than this week’s anniversary of his 1,000th game at the helm. Across more than two decades, Wenger’s Arsenal broke records, moved homes and changed their image forever. Here we look back at some memorable moments and the numbers behind a towering sporting era. Wenger’s initial years in north London saw him skilfully combine the rugged English core of a team that previously enjoyed trophy success under George Graham with his more pioneering ideas – a blend that found full realisation with the 1997-98 double success. “One of my jobs was to keep faithful to the qualities I had found here. I tried always to maintain the tradition and values of this club,” Wenger said on the eve of his final game at Huddersfield Town in May 2018. That was game 1,235 and game one took place on the other side of the Pennines against Blackburn Rovers on October 12, 1996. Foremost among the qualities Wenger found at Arsenal were those of the man who would become the club’s record goalscorer on his watch. Ian Wright scored both goals to get the brave new era up and running with a 2-0 win over a club who had been champions of England a little over a year earlier. Wright was 33 when Wenger arrived and injury curtailed his involvement in the glorious 1997-98 run-in. However, earlier in that season he broke Cliff Bastin’s long-standing Arsenal club record and concluded his Gunners’ career with 185 goals in 288 appearances. The England striker’s best mark would, of course, be surpassed by the great Thierry Henry, whose phenomenal haul of 228 all came on Wenger’s watch. Overall, there were five goalscoring centurions during the Wenger era, with Robin van Persie next on the list with 132 before his acrimonious departure to Manchester United in 2012. Theo Walcott (108), Olivier Giroud (105) and Wright’s one-time strike partner Dennis Bergkamp (102) were the other men into three figures. That first taste of victory was one of 10 wins in 17 visits to Ewood Park, a win percentage of 59%. Of the away or neutral venues Wenger’s Arsenal played at in Britain, that ratio was only bettered by seven wins from 11 at Fulham’s Craven Cottage (64%). Of course, there are other grounds far more synonymous with his reign, not least the home of Manchester United and his great rival Alex Ferguson. Other than Highbury and the Emirates, Wenger managed his biggest number of Arsenal games at Old Trafford – 31 in total. It was often an unhappy hunting ground, the scene of an 8-2 defeat in August 2011 that was his worst in terms of goals conceded and joint-heaviest by margin. Only at Stoke City’s Bet365 Stadium (18%) and Tottenham’s White Hart Lane (24%) was Wenger’s win ratio lower than at Old Trafford (W8 D6 L17 for 26%). But when the wins came, they were seismic. In March 1998, Marc Overmars nodded Nicolas Anelka’s flick-on into his own path and steered beyond Peter Schmeichel for a 1-0 victory that proved pivotal in that season’s title race. Another iconic Arsenal moment came in May 2002, when Sylvain Wiltord pounced to beat compatriot Fabian Barthez and the Gunners secured Premier League glory on United’s own patch. There were more recriminations than celebrations in September 2003 after an ill-tempered 0-0 draw between the sides. However, had Ruud van Nistelrooy not crashed a penalty against the crossbar – much to Martin Keown’s contorted, vein-popping satisfaction – Arsenal would not have been Invincibles. An away ground not quite as synonymous with Wenger is the Madejski Stadium. Nevertheless, Reading are the opponent Arsenal played most often while maintaining a 100% record under the Frenchman, winning 10 out of 10. The most famous of these wins was a 7-5 triumph in Berkshire in October 2012, where Arsenal averted EFL Cup embarrassment in utterly berserk fashion. After 35 minutes, Reading were 4-0 up thanks to Jason Roberts, a Laurent Koscielny own goal, Mikele Leigertwood and Noel Hunt. Afterwards, their manager Brian McDermott, a former Arsenal player, would reflect upon the “worst” defeat of his career. Walcott reduced the arrears before the interval and the England winger’s second of the match deep into injury time, after a goal from Giroud and one at the right end from Koscielny, forced an additional half hour. Marouane Chamakh put Arsenal ahead for the first time in the tie and, although Pavel Pogrebnyak made it 5-5, the Moroccan forward scored his second after Walcott completed his hat-trick to crown what Wenger dubbed “maybe my greatest comeback”, with a touch of understatement. It was not the only time Arsenal scored seven under Wenger and the biggest wins of his tenure came when they kept the back door shut, with Everton, Middlesbrough and Slavia Prague all beaten 7-0 in a spell spanning May 2005 to October 2007. Coincidentally, Slavia’s neighbours Sparta are next on Wenger’s perfect record list after Reading, losing six out of six against Arsenal in the Champions League. Over time, an underlying warmth revealed itself in the Wenger-Ferguson rivalry. It was hard to say the same when it came to his jousts with Jose Mourinho. Wenger was a “voyeur” and a “specialist in failure” according to Mourinho’s acidic tongue and the older man could be similarly biting. “When you give success to stupid people, it makes them more stupid sometimes and not more intelligent,” he witheringly observed after Mourinho announced himself in English football with his 2004-05 Chelsea sweeping all before them. It will therefore have stung deeply when Wenger’s 1,000th game in charge of Arsenal saw them ransacked in a 6-0 demolition at Stamford Bridge on March 22, 2014. If the manner of the loss was humiliating, the defeat itself was one to be expected. In 19 encounters with Mourinho, Wenger won two – an 11% win ratio that is by far his worst against another manager, with 31% thanks to 15 victories from 49 attempts versus Ferguson next on the list. Those paltry returns against the self-styled ‘Special One’ mostly come within a wider context of decline. Wenger’s first decade at Arsenal – spanning 1996-97 to 2005-06, their last at Highbury – yielded 11 trophies out of the 17 he won overall in north London, including all three Premier League titles. However, Arsenal’s win percentage held up after the move to Emirates Stadium in August 2006, dipping fractionally to 57% from 58%. They also scored slightly more often, with their goals-per-game figure up from 1.8 to 1.9 in the latter period. In their new home stadium, Wenger oversaw 228 competitive wins, but a slightly lower win ratio (68%)  than he achieved at Highbury (70%). By this point, Wenger was joined in the Premier League by the finest coaching talents from across Europe. It was a far cry from his own appointment when he became only the fourth manager in England’s top-flight to hail from outside the British Isles. Mourinho, Pep Guardiola, Jürgen Klopp and others had all come along to raise the bar Wenger set to even greater heights, although he would enjoy one last defining triumph at the expense of one of their contemporaries. Chelsea entered the 2017 FA Cup final as hot favourites to complete the double after romping to Premier League glory in Antonio Conte’s first season in charge. A 3-0 defeat to Arsenal the previous September inspired Conte to revert to his favoured 3-4-2-1 system and was the catalyst for a dominant revival. This turn of events seemed to encapsulate the futility of the late Wenger years, when every small success appeared only to serve as a precursor for a greater disappointment. You could even say the same for his last final in the competition he dominated, give it preceded his lowest ever Premier League finish of sixth in his farewell campaign. But Arsenal were stirringly brilliant that day at Wembley. Per Mertesacker was wheeled out of cold storage to put in a colossal display at centre-back as Alexis Sanchez and Aaron Ramsey sealed a deserved 2-1 win. Ramsey ranks 10th among Arsenal’s top scorers of the Wenger era with 58 and two of those were FA Cup final winners, the Wales midfielder also netting decisively against Hull City in 2014. Those were Wenger’s fifth and seventh successes in a competition he has won more than any other manager in history, where his incredible Arsenal tenure means his position is ensured for posterity.

6892,Jesus to Arsenal close and Everton join Zinchenko race as Manchester City prepare for clutch of departures,"Gabriel Jesus is expected to be the first major departure from Manchester City this summer with a number of high-profile players set to follow.  The Brazilian is closing on a switch to Arsenal amid interest in a number of City players from Premier League rivals.  Everton are leading the chase for Ukraine international Oleksandr Zinchenko while Chelsea want forward Raheem Sterling.  Man City value Jesus at around £50 million ($61m) despite having only year one remaining on his contract and an agreement between the Premier League champions and Arsenal is expected to be reached.  The Gunners have had a bid, believed to have been around £30m ($37m), rejected but a structured deal including performance-related add-ons could push the price closer to City's valuation.  Man City have already brought in strikers Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund for £51m ($63m) and Julian Alvarez for £14m ($18m) from River Plate, who will join up with the squad in the summer despite a number of loan approaches for the Argentinian.  Everton are keen on the Ukrainian international to bolster their creativity in midfield, pushing him further forward from the left-back position where he has spent the majority of his time playing for City.  A number of other Premier League clubs are interested in the 25-year-old with West Ham understood to be one of them.  Man City want to be bring in another left-back this summer with Brighton's Marc Cucerella among the top targets.  With one year left on his current contract with the Premier League champions, Chelsea are ready to make a move for the England international.  The London club have long held an interest in Sterling and are in the market for a new forward if Romelu Lukaku completes a loan switch back to former club Inter.  Reports in Italy claim Sterling could cost as little as £35m ($43m) but that is unlikely to come anywhere close to City's valuation of the 27-year-old.  Ilkay Gundogan and Riyad Mahrez both have 12 months remaining on their current deals but they are expected to remain at Etihad Stadium next season.  Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho has already left after his contract expired but there could be a number of highly-rate young players to follow.  Striker Liam Delap signed a new contract keeping him at the club until 2026 last year but could leave on loan with Southampton among those linked.  Leeds have enquired about Belgian midfielder Romeo Lavia amid Man City's interest in England international Kalvin Phillips.  A number of clubs are chasing James McAtee but he could remain at the club to bolster the squad and gain first-time experience after impressing for the under-18s.

3250,'Did you expect me to have a black eye?' - Mourinho claims 'no balls' bust-up after Roma loss to Inter 'a total lie' ,"Jose Mourinho has dismissed any notion of a dressing room bust-up as “a total lie”, insisting his squad are happy with his methods in the wake of reports claiming he told his players they have “no balls” after losing to Inter in the Coppa Italia. Roma were sent crashing out at the quarter-final stage last week as they suffered a 2-0 defeat at San Siro. Goals from former Giallorossi striker Edin Dzeko and Alexis Sanchez gave the reigning Serie A champions a comfortable victory, with Mourinho left contemplating yet another defeat to one of the top clubs in Italy. Post-match headlines were dominated by reports that the Roma boss lambasted his players in the dressing room, questioning some for their lack of courage while declaring that others belong in Serie C. Mourinho has yet to confirm or deny what was actually said, but is adamant he still has the full trust of the squad and that he won't change his managerial approach. “From the stories I've heard, some might have been expecting me to arrive here with a black eye and a swollen face because of all the punches – that's a big lie,” he told reporters ahead of Roma's clash with Sassuolo on Sunday. “The story that came out of a breakup between me and the players is a total lie. We talked after the game, analysed and worked on those errors. That is how I work. “The players told me they are happy with my working methods. There are no secrets between us, I say things to their face and I invite the players to engage in a dialogue.  “Everyone told me they don’t want me to change, so I told them I will not change. You talk about it as me letting loose frustration, but do you think I shouldn’t reproach [Roger] Ibanez, [Rick] Karsdorp, [Gianluca] Mancini or [Chris] Smalling?  “Now ask me questions about Sassuolo or I am leaving.” Mourinho was also asked to address comments from Sassuolo coach Alessio Dionisi suggesting that Roma have a slight advantage due to boasting better technical players in their ranks. He responded curtly: “If anything, Sassuolo have much more quality and technique than my team. They can play out from the back with their defenders, I can’t do that.” Mourinho was handed a three-year contract when he inherited the managerial reins at Stadio Olimpico last summer, but it has been suggested that he is already on borrowed time. Roma have slipped to seventh in the Serie A standings after 24 matches and only have the Europa Conference League left to play for in terms of silverware. A defeat against Sassuolo could leave the Giallorossi's chances of Champions League qualification up in smoke, and Mourinho could be on the lookout for a new job once again unless he can oversee a swift turnaround in fortunes.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mourinho-claims-no-balls-bust-up-after-roma-loss-to-inter-a/blt5bf71d1402675e83,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1911,Crystal Palace hopeful of striking deal to take Gallagher from Chelsea again,"Crystal Palace ""would love"" to take Conor Gallagher from Chelsea again this summer, club chairman Steve Parish has admitted. Gallagher joined Palace on a season-long loan in July 2021, and has since played a key role in the club's push for a top 10 Premier League finish under Patrick Vieira. The 22-year-old has recorded eight goals and five assists in 36 games across all competitions for the Eagles, but is due back at Chelsea at the end of the season. No option to buy was included in the loan deal for Gallagher, who is still under contract at Chelsea until 2025, and Parish says a final decision on his future will be made by the Blues. The Palace chief is still holding out hope that the midfielder's services can be secured for next season, though, as he has told reporters: “Conor’s future and that decision lies not with us but with him and Chelsea. They're the people that have to decide. “Once they decide what their choice is, they know where we are and what we want. We're not going to pretend any different but we've got to respect them as a football club because he's their player. “At the end of the season he goes back to Chelsea and they'll make their decision. Based on that, we'll be there and if everybody thinks it's the right thing for him to come back then we would love it. “If it doesn't work out, we wish him all the best as well.” Even if the Eagles are unable to keep hold of Gallagher, Parish still has high hopes for the future and says they have other targets in mind to improve the squad. Palace's end goal is to emulate unfancied 2015-16 title winners Leicester and start challenging for silverware, as their chairman added: “Obviously with Conor, we've got to see what we can do there. He's going back and we've got to either replace him or see if we can get him back. “We've got one or two other situations that are well-documented so keeping what we've got here is an important thing. Then we've got one or two ideas of where we think we can add to make a difference, give ourselves something different, get even better at keeping the ball and be a bit more damaging when we've got it. “There's no limit to our ambition at the football club. We'll obviously look to bring some of the youngsters through that we've got who are very good and we start every year dreaming of being Leicester.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/crystal-palace-hopeful-deal-gallagher-chelsea/blt57c3e79d3718fe2d,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4842,Spalletti confirms Chelsea target Koulibaly could leave Napoli amid reports of imminent €40m transfer to Stamford Bridge,"Napoli coach Luciano Spalletti has admitted that Kalidou Koulibaly could leave the club this summer amid reports Chelsea are close to signing him. The centre-back has been linked with a move away from the Serie A side several times in recent years but reports this week claim that he is closer to making a transfer than ever before. The Premier League side are said to be nearing an agreement with the Stadio San Paolo team over a €40 million (£34m/$40m) transfer fee. Napoli must either sell the centre-back soon or see him leave for free in 2023 and Spalletti admits that he may be on his way out. ""I always remain of the same opinion. I always prefer Koulibaly to everyone,"" Spalletti said in a Q&A session with Napoli fans. ""It is easy for me because he, as a Napoli player, is the one who has the highest average points. When he was on the pitch, we scored more points. ""Should he choose to go, we will never stop thanking him for everything he taught us and for everything he gave us to make us play in the Champions League this year. ""He is very good, very strong. This year he would also be captain [if he chose to stay].

His performances in that time caught the attention of Barcelona, Manchester City and Manchester United, but Chelsea are now poised to land one of the most highly sought-after defenders in Europe.

9896,Arsenal among 'admirers' of Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall — how he'd fit Mikel Arteta's XI shown,"Arsenal are strong admirers of Leicester City midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who is in the running to win Championship Player of the Season, reports The Athletic. Brighton are already in talks with Leicester for Dewsbury-Hall, 25, but The Athletic understands there is a gap between their offer and what the Foxes are demanding. Leicester want at least £30 million for the talented midfielder, who has smashed nine goals and assisted nine more already this season. If Brighton refuse to meet their valuation, Arsenal could make a move. The Athletic also adds that Edu believes Dewsbury-Hall is just what the Gunners need. However, Arsenal have their hands tied from signing him this month, thanks to Financial Fair Play restrictions. Knowing what Dewsbury-Hall is capable of, Leicester are not likely to accept anything below £30 million; that's still a pretty modest fee. If the Englishman does end up joining Arsenal, here's how he'd fit Mikel Arteta's XI. Alongside Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard, Dewsbury-Hall could slot in as the perfect creative addition. He's adept at scoring and assisting, meaning he'd work in tandem with someone like Odegaard. Considering we play with a striker like Gabriel Jesus, who is more known for his work rate off the ball, Dewsbury-Hall could cook up some magic.",https://tribuna.com/en/news/arsenal-2024-01-27-arsenal-among-admirers-of-kiernan-dewsburyhall-how-hed-fit-mikel-artetas-xi-shown/,Meghna @ 1819,2024-01-27T12:15:00.000Z,The Athletic
2260,Rudiger to leave Chelsea as Real Madrid lead race to sign Blues defender on free transfer but Man Utd & Barcelona also keen,"Antonio Rudiger will leave Chelsea at the end of the season, with Real Madrid leading the race to sign him ahead of the likes of Manchester United and Barcelona, GOAL can confirm. The defender has turned down the Blues' latest offer to extend his contract, which expires at the end of the season. And Rudiger is now expected to complete a free transfer move away from Stamford Bridge this summer, with Real Madrid at the front of the queue to sign him. Interest in the Germany international has been building for some time, with many of Europe's top teams linked to him throughout the final year of his contract. Madrid are the team currently leading the race to land the 29-year-old and are in advanced talks with his representatives, GOAL can confirm. However, United are also still in the picture and are hopeful of convincing him to remain in England by making the switch to Old Trafford. Barcelona and Juventus are the other teams interested in landing the centre-back. A big factor in Rudiger's decision to leave Chelsea is the uncertainty around the club's ownership. Chelsea are working closely with the UK government to facilitate a sale following sanctions on current owner Roman Abramovic, but the confusion has put Rudiger's future in doubt. He was close to signing a new deal that would have made him the highest-paid defender at Chelsea. The former Roma star wants to have his future decided in the coming weeks, however, and with Chelsea's new owner still to be confirmed, he now looks all but certain to depart the club.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rudiger-to-leave-chelsea-as-real-madrid-lead-race-to-sign/blt0817fcb76c9263fe,By Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4338,'The world's his oyster' - The making of Chelsea's Champions League-winning star Reece James,"England have a wealth of options at right-back. Kyle Walker and Kieran Trippier enjoyed the most game time as Gareth Southgate’s side reached the final of the European Championship, but the next generation is even more promising. After his early breakthrough at Liverpool, it was widely predicted that Trent Alexander-Arnold would make the position his own, but Reece James is challenging that assumption, taking his game to the next level with a series of excellent performances for Chelsea. There are similarities in their levels of maturity and technical ability, but also differences too. While James is a better defender than Alexander-Arnold, with more speed and strength, his attacking output lacks the same consistency. That is improving as the 22-year-old continues to thrive under Thomas Tuchel, registering five goals and six assists so far this season. This battle for prominence should bring the best out of them, but James’ recent success has been a long time in the making. He instinctively stood out at youth level, as his former academy team-mate Cole Dasilva recalls. “You always had an idea of the players who were destined to be where they are now. He was definitely one of them, along with the boys he’s in the first team with – Mason [Mount], Callum [Hudson-Odoi], Trevoh [Chalobah],” Dasilva tells GOAL. “Reece was someone who got better every game, every year. He had a few players ahead of him and it’s no surprise that he got in front of them. He’s always been so determined. He’s always pushed himself through injuries, through setbacks.” Dasilva was 12 when he joined Chelsea from Luton Town alongside his brothers Jay and Rio, meeting James for the first time. Despite being well established in the Blues youth system by then, he was still an unassuming character. “He was a quiet boy, head down, but when he got on the pitch, he came to life. As we got older and grew up within the club, the more comfortable everyone got with each other. He definitely came out of his shell, and he became one of the main figures in our team, on and off the pitch.” As a young prospect, James was athletic, but initially quite slight. After a bad injury, Dasilva remembers him making a conscious effort to bulk up and become the strong, physically-commanding player he is now. “We all have areas that we need to improve on,"" Dasilva says. ""Before his injury, it may have been the physical side of things and maybe that’s why he pushed so hard to get his body into the best shape it can be and maintained that as we got older. “It’s definitely something he’s put his focus on. I’m sure the coaches, and his dad, would have advised him along the way. That’s something that’s taken him to that next step and helped him realise that he can handle the men’s game with ease.” James’ position evolved too. He started out as a winger, before dropping back into midfield and then defence. Regardless, he never lost his attacking intent and well-honed ability to whip in dangerous crosses from out wide. “He was a joy to play alongside. You always knew you could trust him. He always wanted the ball, and he always gave everything. You always knew he would perform because he was such a talent,” explains Dasilva, who now plays for HNK Sibenik in Croatia. “I play in the same position as Reece, so I took a lot from him, the way he crosses the ball especially. That’s obviously one of his main attributes. I remember doing sessions with him and I took that on with me. His best attribute is definitely his crossing.” Dasilva and James developed a close friendship during their years together at Chelsea. They sat next to each other in the dressing room and are still in touch now, despite the different routes their careers have taken.  “We were always in conversation and had a lot of the same interests music-wise and outside of football. We had a lot of things in common, so we got on really well. He’s a very nice guy. Very generous. “On a few occasions, he’d come into training and he’d have little gifts for me. It could just be a little bit of body cream or aftershave, but if he had a spare one, he was always willing to give and make someone else’s day. He’s honestly a great guy – down-to-earth and sound as you can get.” As he rose through the ranks, James was a key component in Chelsea’s continued dominance of the FA Youth Cup. In the 2017 final, they dismantled a strong Manchester City side, which featured Phil Foden and Jadon Sancho, 6-2 on aggregate.  Dasilva, who came off the bench to score in the second leg, loved growing alongside that team, which boasted incredible strength in depth, as Marc Guehi, Conor Gallagher and Ike Ugbo were also involved. “That experience was fantastic,” he reflects. “It’s something we all wanted to do and being a part of it was massive. The first leg was away and it was a 1-1 draw. It was a very close game. We knew what a good team they were.  “It was never going to be easy but, being back at the Bridge, we were always confident. We knew the talent we had, and we knew we could turn them over. That’s exactly what we did from the start. It was a great night. “The talent was endless. Every single one of us was good enough to start both games in the final. I suppose Jody [Morris], the manager, was kind of spoilt for choice. The years before that, and even after, we still had talent in abundance, but that group was special. Very special. There were some big names.” Morris often used 3-4-3, partly influenced by the success the first team was enjoying with that formation under Antonio Conte, and great partnerships developed all over the pitch. James demonstrated his defensive skills and reading of the game on the right of the back three, with Dujon Sterling ahead of him at wing-back. “It suited us a lot,"" Dasilva recalls. ""Those two on the right side were unstoppable. Reece fitted in there really well. He’s very versatile. He can play right centre-back, right-back, central midfield. You see him dominate in all areas.” A year on, James lifted the trophy as captain, after Chelsea beat Arsenal 7-1 in the final. He was ready for senior football and joined Wigan Athletic on a season-long loan that summer. They had just won promotion back to the Championship and were looking to consolidate. “We had Nathan Byrne, who was our mainstay at right-back and had won Player of the Year. A couple of weeks into pre-season, Nathan picked up a groin injury and that thrust Reece into the team,” Michael Jacobs, a regular in that Wigan side, tells GOAL. “You could tell from the way he approached training and games that he had that elite mindset. He was never arrogant, but he had this belief in himself that he was always going to do really well. He seamlessly slotted straight in.” James moved up to Bolton and lived in the same apartment block as some of his fellow loanees. His ability and work ethic guaranteed the respect of his team-mates. Although he was never a big, boisterous presence in the Wigan dressing room, he adapted well to his new environment and grew in confidence. “The Championship is a robust and tough league,” Jacobs says. “It’s obviously a lot different from playing academy football and you never really know. He had that level of quality and physicality to stand up to any sort of challenge. As the season went along, he flourished.” A winger by trade, Jacobs regularly tested himself against James in training. “I didn’t really get much change out of him throughout the season,” he laughs. “Naturally you try and find a weakness in the full-back’s game – if they’re not as good in the air, or you can run in behind him – but he’s just got all the attributes. James faced plenty of tricky left-sided players in the Championship, including Ollie Watkins, Yannick Bolasie and Todd Cantwell, but Jacobs remembers barely any of them getting the better of him. When he did struggle, he made sure to come back stronger. “We played Swansea away just after Christmas. We couldn’t win an away game for love nor money. He had a bit of a sticky afternoon against Jefferson Montero. No one had really tested him in his short time with us. That was the first time someone had got the better of him.  “The two games after that he was very resolute. Even though he had a tough afternoon, he recovered really quickly. For a young lad to come in from an academy, playing his first season in the Championship, I think that was fantastic.” Loan players are sometimes guilty of looking out for themselves, but not James. He committed fully to the task at hand, fighting to keep the Latics clear from relegation trouble after a mid-season slump. They lost just one of their last nine games to finish 18th. “It sounds a bit funny, but it felt like when you have the best player in school, and you try to fit him in different positions,"" Jacobs says. ""He was too good, so by the end of the season we brought Nathan back in to play right-back and he went into midfield. He was on corners, free kicks, penalties. He was a massive part of us staying up.” James featured in 44 games, more than any other Wigan player, claiming several personal accolades while being named in the Championship Team of the Year alongside the likes of Kalvin Phillips and Jarrod Bowen. His pace and stamina enabled him to compensate for occasionally suspect positioning, but that has improved with coaching and experience. That process has only been accelerated by Tuchel’s input, as shown in the way he shackled Raheem Sterling as Chelsea won the Champions League final. “His all-round game is probably one of the best I’ve seen,” says Jacobs. “His delivery from different areas of the pitch is so pinpoint, it’s up there with the best in the Premier League. But there’s also his one-v-one defending and his ability to see someone off. That’s what you want in a modern-day full-back or wing-back.” On his return to Stamford Bridge, James benefited from the club’s transfer embargo, and the presence of Jody Morris, his former academy manager, as Frank Lampard’s assistant. After recovering from injury, he starred in a 7-1 win over Grimsby Town on his debut and went on to make 37 appearances in all competitions. James bettered that total last season, breaking into the England squad. He is now delivering vital contributions on a more regular basis as Chelsea compete for honours at home and abroad. He is not content to settle, though, and those who have played with him believe there is still more to come. “He’s so down to earth and he’s so humble. He’s got the right attitude. He wants to do well, and he wants to improve. He also knows what he’s capable of without having that sort of ego and arrogance,” says Jacobs. “The world’s his oyster with the standard’s he’s set himself at the start of this season, and in the Euros with England. He can go on to have an unbelievable career. I think if he stays healthy and injury-free, there’s no reason why not.” For Dasilva, who shared so many formative experiences with James, his success is particularly sweet. “I think there’s no limit to where he could go. I can say I’m one of the lucky ones to get to know him and say I’ve played with him.  “Seeing him now, dominating at the top level, is special. It’s definitely what he deserves, alongside all the boys from the academy who are doing it. It’s amazing to see and long may it continue.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/the-world-s-his-oyster-the-making-of-chelsea-s-champions/blt487920749109442f,Sean Cole,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
794,Liverpool vs Leeds and Wolves vs Watford postponed as Covid-19 threatens Boxing Day schedule,"Liverpool's clash with Leeds and Wolves' meeting with Watford have been postponed due to Covid-19, which is threatening the entire Boxing Day schedule. The coronavirus variant Omicron has already caused disruption to the Premier League calendar, with a number of clubs forced into closing their training grounds to contain the spread of the ilness. Only four fixtures ended up going ahead last weekend, and Boxing Day will also now have a reduced order of play after Leeds and Watford reported outbreaks in their squads. A Premier League statement reads: ""Following postponement requests from Leeds United and Watford as a result of Covid-19, the Premier League board met this morning and regrettably agreed to call off the two affected clubs’ Boxing Day fixtures. 📰 #LUFC are disappointed to confirm that our Boxing Day fixture with Liverpool has been postponed following new COVID cases ""The two matches are Wolverhampton Wanderers v Watford and Liverpool v Leeds United, both due to be played on Sunday at 12:30 GMT. ""The Board today was able to make its decisions in advance of Boxing Day to give clarity to clubs and their supporters. We apologise for the inconvenience and disruption caused to those fans’ festive plans."" The Premier League has confirmed that our Boxing Day trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers has been postponed as a result of COVID-19.#WOLWAT The Premier League assesses Covid-19 outbreaks on a case by case basis, meaning as it stands the remaining eight Boxing Day fixtures will go ahead as scheduled. Liverpool's trip to Leicester City and Wolves' encounter against Arsenal on December 28 won't be affected either unless further outbreaks are reported, but Leeds are set to face more delays. The Whites have been forced to close their training ground and may not be able to fulfil their next fixture against Aston Villa. There is some light at the end of the tunnel for Watford though, who also saw their game against Crystal Palace last Saturday called off.

806,Barcelona agree €55m deal to sign Manchester City winger Ferran Torres,"Barcelona have agreed a €55 million (£47m/$62m) deal to sign Manchester City winger Ferran Torres, GOAL can confirm. The Spain international, who hasn't played for City since September due to a foot injury, is set to join Xavi's side in January despite the Catalans' financial troubles. Barca will now have to focus on offloading players from their first-team squad as they look to meet La Liga's financial fair play rules. GOAL can confirm Barca have reached an agreement with City to sign Torres, with both clubs set to officially announce the news in the coming days. Barca's director of football Mateu Alemany undertook the negotiations with the Spain international, who is keen to return to his homeland after leaving Valencia in August 2020. The Liga club will pay an initial fee of €55m for Torres, with an additional amount of around €7m to follow in add-ons. GOAL understands City had requested a figure approaching €70m for the player, but have ultimately settled on a slightly smaller fee. Valencia will receive 10% of the transfer, having added that stipulation to their agreement with City last year, plus an additional 4%. Barcelona's financial woes have been well documented, and players will now have to leave as a matter of urgency to ensure Torres can be registered in La Liga. Sergio Aguero's decision to retire due to a heart condition frees up his salary, with others needing to be offloaded, either on loan or, more preferably, in permanent transfers.  Barca would listen to offers for many of their first-team squad, aside from a few untouchables including Pedri, Gavi and Ansu Fati, with big-earners including Samuel Umtiti and Philippe Coutinho in the shop window.  Ferran Torres represented great value when he joined Manchester City in the summer of 2020 but he has struggled to force his way into Pep Guardiola's plans.  Competing for a place as a winger with players such as Riyad Mahrez, Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva is not easy, although he has made his biggest impact as a central striker.  While he has also excelled for Spain's national team, realistically City are still in the hunt for a more orthodox striker and reliable scorer, which they haven't had since Aguero left the club.  A sizeable return on Torres is too good to turn down and can help finance a big-money move elsewhere, with Borussia Dortmund star Erling Haaland a top target.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-50m-deal-man-city-winger-ferran-torres/bltf590fd3ad3646f26,Ruben Uria,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8420,Huddersfield 1-0 Sunderland: Matty Pearson steers Terriers to victory,"Matty Pearson's first-half goal pulled Huddersfield five points clear of the Championship relegation places with a 1-0 victory over Sunderland at the John Smith's Stadium. Huddersfield were 5-3 beaten by promotion-chasing Southampton at the weekend and their confidence in front of goal showed when Pearson put them in front eight minutes before the break. The Terriers have not lost on their own patch this year and were good value for a second successive home win - they could have had more than the solitary goal but for the woodwork and a goal-line clearance - but needed goalkeeper Lee Nicholls' heroics to secure three points. Huddersfield's first chance came when Sorba Thomas dispossessed Daniel Ballard on the last line of defence and Luke O'Nien's challenge recycled the ball out to a waiting David Kasumu who sliced wide of the target. O'Nien brought Kasumu down outside the area which presented Huddersfield with a good set-piece opportunity on the edge of the area. Jack Rudoni's vicious strike from the free-kick was palmed by Anthony Patterson into the path of Pearson who bundled home from close range. Huddersfield held their breath on the stroke of half-time when a short corner was worked out to Dan Neil, who fired an effort on target which looked to be a routine save for Nicholls, only for it to slip through his grasp out for a corner. Championship Table Find out more about Sky Sports Sunderland were making a habit of giving Huddersfield dangerous free-kicks, this time Trai Hume brought Koroma down and the Huddersfield striker picked himself up and curled the resulting free-kick onto the near post. Sunderland went in search of an equaliser and their first effort on target of the half came when Jobe Bellingham drilled into the gloves of Nicholls. Huddersfield came within the width of the goal-line of doubling their advantage when Rudoni's glancing header was cleared by Bellingham before appeals for handball were swiftly waved away by referee Gavin Ward. Michael Beale rolled the dice with his substitutions in search of a leveller and Patrick Roberts' strike from outside the box looked to be heading in before it was deflected over the bar. The visitors thought they had earned a last-gasp equaliser when Hume was put through on goal only to be denied by the outstretched Nicholls as he magnificently tipped behind. Nicholls was once again the hero in the final minute of added time when O'Nien's cross was diverted towards his own goal by Tom Lees but the Huddersfield keeper sprung well to tip over the bar and earn another vital home win. Huddersfield's interim manager Jon Worthington: ""Another game I really enjoyed - a committed performance from the lads. We had to go again from Saturday's performance, in terms of the result, and I was happy with the desire the lads showed. ""I think it was a real squad effort to make sure we all dug in together to get over the line and the result. ""From the first minute we were on the front foot, wanting to run forward and support each other. "" Sunderland's Michael Beale: ""To concede off a set-piece away from home is not good enough is it? ""It's a pretty standard set-piece we've conceded from before half-time. We had our moments, but it's a bad night. ""It's a disappointing night. I thought Huddersfield made it a physical game and there was a point in the first half when we needed to roll our sleeves up and give a bit back, and I'm not sure we did that. ""On our best day we are slightly better than teams in this league, but I don't think we are going to blow anyone away. We don't score enough goals to blow teams away."" The £250,000 is up for grabs with Super 6, and as always it is completely free to play.

1667,Brighton's Lallana 'embarrassed' by lack of knowledge of new Liverpool star Luis Diaz,"Brighton midfielder Adam Lallana admits that he was “embarrassed” at not having heard of Luis Diaz before the attacker's move from Porto to Liverpool. Diaz has hit the ground running at Anfield, impressing with his performances and providing the Reds' fearsome frontline with healthy competition for a starting spot. And Lallana, a former Liverpool player himself, has been stunned by the Colombian's instant impact after arriving at Anfield. “I still can’t believe how well Diaz has settled, having been a player that has gone to Liverpool and knowing how difficult it was to settle,” the former England international told BBC Radio 5 Live Sport. “I am not sure what Diaz’s English is like. But coming from a different country in January, and to play the way he has played, is absolutely phenomenal.” Having been in the ground for Liverpool's Carabao Cup final win over Chelsea, Lallana added: “I was at Wembley, to see how he performed, I think he was Liverpool’s best player and most dynamic. “I actually feel a little embarrassed that I hadn’t heard about him before. That just shows the level of recruitment at Liverpool.  “They have been spot on in that kind of £50 million bracket. With [Mohamed] Salah, [Sadio] Mane, [Roberto] Firmino and Jota. They have just got it right.” Lallana may well get a chance to share a pitch with Diaz come Saturday, as Liverpool travel to Brighton's Amex Stadium for a Premier League clash. The Seagulls are without a win in their previous four top-flight matches, with the visit of the title-chasing Reds representing a daunting prospect as Jurgen Klopp's side continue to grind out results.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/brighton-lallana-embarrassed-liverpool-luis-diaz/blt67a033d68da91331,Stephen Crawford,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

The London club came calling for Cubarsi before he signed his first professional contract last year keeping him at Barca until 2026. The 17-year-old is still available for just €10m the meagre fee in his buyout clause. Barca are said to be working to extend his contract and increase that buyout clause before Chelsea steals their gem. Cubarsi has been Barca's revelation in defence with Xavi trusting the youngster in recent games with Andreas Christensen struggling with his fitness. Thus, we've watched Cubarsi play six matches for Barca in recent times and he's barely put a foot wrong. He also surprised us with his assist against Unionistas in the Copa Del Rey round of 16. If Barca doesn't work quickly Chelsea could get Cubarsi without much fuss. They have so much money to spend after spending an excess of €1 billion in the last three transfer windows.

10025,The Oldest Premier League Managers,"Who are the oldest Premier League managers of all time? We look back across the history of the competition to give you a run down of the top 10 oldest to take charge of a match. Roy Hodgson made his second surprising managerial comeback with a return to the Crystal Palace dugout on April Fools Day 2023 – but this was no hoax.  At the end of 2020-21, Hodgson had “ended” his 45-year managerial career as Crystal Palace manager with their Premier League trip to former club Liverpool at Anfield. That was until January 2022, when the former England manager decided to have one last crack at the big time when taking over at Watford. Hodgson hadn’t ever suffered relegation from the Premier League before this managerial spell, and when taking over there was a good chance that he could continue that run – Watford were just two points from safety with two games in hand on 17th-placed Norwich City. It didn’t work out well for the veteran, however. Hodgson helped Watford win just nine points in 18 games as manager, with his 0.50 points per game at the club by far the lowest he’d ever achieved at a Premier League side. This average was even lower than his predecessor Claudio Ranieri – the fifth oldest Premier League manager – who averaged 0.54 points-per-game at the Hornets. Fast-forward to March 2023 and Crystal Palace had just relieved Patrick Vieira of his duties as their manager. A few days later, Hodgson made a sensational return to the club, taking the reigns at the south London side in their battle to avoid relegation. He made the perfect start, beating fellow relegation-threatened Leicester City at Selhurst Park and sealing the club’s first Premier League win in 13 attempts. They did it in style, too – attempting 31 shots in the victory, which was a joint club record since detailed shot data began being collected in 2003-04. Hodgson’s side picked up the win thanks to a goal from Jean-Philippe Mateta deep into injury-time. His strike on 93 minutes 39 seconds was Crystal Palace’s second-latest Premier League winner on record (since 2006-07), after Christian Benteke’s vs. Brighton in February 2021 (94:10) and their latest ever on record in a home game in the competition. The veteran manager steered Palace to safety with an 11th place finish and has continued as boss in 2023-24 after signing a new one-year deal to stay on in the summer. As a result, Hodgson will set a new record each week he takes charge of a game. The much-admired Bobby Robson was 71 years, 192 days old on his final Premier League game as a manager, with Newcastle’s 0-0 draw at Aston Villa his last. This was only the Magpies’ second Premier League game of the 2004-05 campaign, but club chairman Freddy Shepherd decided that it was time for a change in management at Newcastle, albeit with strange reasoning. This wasn’t Robson’s only stint as a top-flight manager in England, but it was his only spell as a Premier League manager. He secured 83 wins and a points-per-game average of 1.60 across his 188 games in the competition. Robson had previously spent over 13 years as boss of Ipswich Town between 1969-1982, winning the UEFA Cup there in 1981. He also managed in Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands, winning a major trophy in each country and picking up league titles with Porto and PSV Eindhoven. His job at Newcastle United was his final managerial role in football, with him managing his first game at 66 years and 205 days old – that would have put him 11th in this list as it was, and just 11 days shy of the age that Sam Allardyce was when he managed his final game in 2021. Former Barcelona boss Robson might not have won a trophy at the Magpies, but he’ll be forever remembered as one of the best English club managers of all-time, as well as one of the most respected England coaches following the Three Lions’ 1990 World Cup performance. He died in July 2009 aged 76, less than five years after his last game as a manager. There’s only been one 5-5 draw in the entire history of the Premier League, but it came in Sir Alex Ferguson’s final game as a manager. The Scotsman took charge of Manchester United for the 1,500th and final time at the Hawthorns in this Premier League meeting with West Brom, aged 71 years and 139 days old. Ferguson won 13 top-flight English league titles as a manager during his 27 years at Manchester United – more than twice as many as any other manager in the history of the league and seven more than his closest rivals. One of these 13 arrived in this final season (2012-13), with United having won the title nearly a month before this meeting with WBA. In the nine seasons since Ferguson’s retirement, the Red Devils haven’t won a single Premier League title under David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick or current boss Erik ten Hag. Obviously – with Robson and Hodgson never having done so – Fergie is the oldest manager to win a Premier League title. If Pep Guardiola was to break this record, he’d need to be managing in the competition in 2042-44 while Jürgen Klopp could do it in 2038-39.  Ferguson has won the most games (528) and most points (1,752) as a Premier League manager, with only Arsenal’s Arsène Wenger (828) having managed more games in the competition than the former Man Utd boss (810). Neil Warnock was still managing in the second tier in England until recently, with the then 74-year-old leaving Championship side Huddersfield Town in September 2023 after saving them from relegation in 2022-23. Now 75, there are always links between Warnock and other EFL jobs, but it feels unlikely we’ll ever see him in a Premier League dugout again. Warnock’s last game as a top-flight coach came in May 2019 with a shock 2-0 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford, despite his Cardiff City side already having been relegated to the Championship. Cardiff’s victory in this match came courtesy of a Nathaniel Mendez-Laing brace and was their first victory over Manchester United since 3 April 1954, when Warnock was just five years old. Claudio Ranieri became only the fifth man aged 70-plus to manage a team in a Premier League game when he took charge of Watford at Everton on October 23, 2021, celebrating the occasion with a brilliant 5-2 victory against the Toffees at Goodison Park. However, his spell at Watford didn’t last long – 112 days to be exact. Ranieri was sacked for poor performance after just 13 matches and two wins. At the time of his sacking, he was the oldest manager in the Premier League (70) and he is now the oldest in Serie A after turning 72 years old in October 2023 – two years and one month older than Empoli boss Aurelio Andreazzoli.  He took Cagliari back into the top flight after winning promotion from Serie B last season, while overall, he’s taken charge of over 850 top-flight games across the Premier League, Ligue 1, Serie A and La Liga with 227 of these games coming in the Premier League across his career at Chelsea, Fulham, Leicester City and the Hornets – famously winning the Premier League title against all the odds with Leicester in 2015-16. Guus Hiddink was nudged out of fifth place in the ranking of the oldest Premier League managers earlier in 2021-22 by Ranieri, with the Dutch boss now in sixth place at 69 years, 189 days old when he took charge of Chelsea versus Leicester City in May 2016 at Stamford Bridge. This was his final match in the competition, before relinquishing his short-term position as boss of the Blues to Antonio Conte. Sam Allardyce was shipped in to try and save Leeds United from Premier League relegation last season, when he replaced Javi Gracia on 3 May 2023 with just four games remaining. In his 30 days in charge of Leeds, he won just one point (W0 D1 L3) and saw Leeds relegated in 19th position. In his final game in charge in the competition on 28 May 2023 (a 4-1 loss to Spurs), Allardyce was 68 years, 221 days old, making him the seventh oldest Premier League manager. Arsène Wenger may top the Premier League ranking for games managed (828), but he’s only the eighth oldest to manage a match in the competition. His final game saw him lead his Arsenal side to a 1-0 away win at Huddersfield Town in May 2018 at the age of 68 years, 203 days old. Wenger has famously won the FA Cup more often than any other manager (seven) but couldn’t end his managerial reign at the Gunners with an eighth in 2017-18. The ninth oldest boss in Premier League history was Dick Advocaat, who was 68 years and six days old when he took charge of Sunderland versus West Ham in October 2015. He quit the club just a day after this game, with Sunderland winless in eight top-flight matches in 2015-16. Harry Redknapp was 67 years, 335 days old in his final match as a Premier League manager, with his QPR side losing 3-1 to Stoke City in January 2015. He resigned just days later with the Hoops in the relegation zone, where they eventually finished before dropping to the Championship. Redknapp took charge of 641 games in the Premier League, with most of these coming at West Ham United (269), but his most successful spell came at Tottenham Hotspur, with Spurs averaging 1.74 points per game under him. Redknapp was over a year older than the 11th oldest Premier League manager of all-time, Marcelo Bielsa. Bielsa was 66 years and 220 days old on the day of his final Premier League match in charge of Leeds United on 26 February 2022 – a 4-0 loss to Spurs at Elland Road. Enjoy this?

3963,Real Madrid to send €30m signing Reinier on loan again with no room for Brazilian in first-team squad,"Real Madrid intend to send Reinier out on loan again next season when the Brazilian returns from his two-year spell at Borussia Dortmund, GOAL understands. The 20-year-old has endured a difficult time in Germany, making just three starts for Dortmund since joining the club in the summer of 2020. Los Blancos splashed out €35 million (£30m/$39m) to bring sign the midfielder from Flamengo in January 2020 and he has yet to make a senior appearance. One of the reasons why Reinier is likely to head out is because there is currently no space for him in Madrid's senior squad. In La Liga, each club is allowed five non-EU players, but are only allowed to name three in each matchday squad. Real are hopeful Vinicius will soon gain Spanish citizenship which would free up one of the three spots he currently occupies, along with fellow Brazilians Eder Militao and Rodrygo. However, that free spot is likely be taken up by Japan winger Takefusa Kubo, who is currently on loan at Mallorca. The club also believe that, at just 20, Reinier may not yet be ready and the opportunity to develop further on loan would be more beneficial. Madrid are working with Reinier to analyse his options, with a loan move to a fellow Liga club the preferred option. This would allow Madrid to follow his progress closely, like Kubo at Mallorca, and they would also ensure it is at a club where he would play regularly. By playing in Spain, Reinier could also begin the process of gaining Spanish citizenship, which would remove any work permit concerns in the future. A number of Portuguese clubs are also monitoring the situation.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/real-madrid-reinier-loan-first-team-squad/blta279f93ec79a8e69,Jorge C.

8553,Man United 'consider' paying off Casemiro's contract to make him leave,"Manchester United are eager to get Casemiro off the books in an attempt to reduce the ever-growing wage bill, reports the Daily Star. A move backed by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's team, the Red Devils are considering paying off Casemiro's contract to get him to leave during the summer. The Brazilian, 31, has a deal that runs till 2026 but Man United reportedly do not wish to keep him that long. In two more years, Casemiro will turn 33 and he's already struggling with poor form and injuries. Despite a promising debut season where he played 28 times in the Premier League, he's only featured eight times this term. The report claims paying off Casemiro entirely would cost Man United £20 million. His departure would significantly reduce the club's growing wage bill.

11678,Total Legend: Remembering Johan Cruyff,"It’s been six years since one of football’s greatest players passed away at the age of 68. Johan Cruyff, pioneer of the Dutch Total Football Philosophy, captained his nation to the World Cup final in 1974 and put the Netherlands on the football map forever. We take a deeper look into his legendary performances at that tournament and the numbers that made it so special. After dramatically failing to qualify for the 1972 European Championships, František Fadrhonc appointed Johan Cruyff as the captain of the Dutch national team. And had it not been for Cruyff, the Netherlands might not have even qualified for the 1974 World Cup in West Germany. Cruyff scored a joint-high seven goals in the UEFA qualifiers leading into the finals, which helped the Netherlands narrowly hold off Belgium on goal difference and qualify for their first major tournament since 1938. Rinus Michels – Cruyff’s manager at Ajax until 1971 and at Barcelona in 1973-74, took over Fadrhonc’s duties after the qualification campaign to prepare a talented generation of players for the finals. The Dutch World Cup squad was about perfectly balanced, from 22-year-old youngsters Johan Neeskens and Johnny Rep to the more experienced Rob Rensenbrink, Wim Suurbier and Willem van Hanegem. With the majority of the squad having won at least one European Cup with Feyenoord (1970) or Ajax (1971, ’72, ’73) in the years leading up to 1974, and with the 27-year-old Cruyff as their orchestrator, the Netherlands were certainly considered contenders for the upcoming World Cup tournament.  And things started well. On the first matchday of the tournament, the Netherlands recorded a routine 2-0 victory over Uruguay. It was a game in which the Dutchmen fired 25 shots while facing only one, and in which Johan Cruyff dictated the pace by recording 107 touches, at least 23 more than any other player in the game. This tally included 16 touches in the Uruguayan area, a tally of touches in the opposition box that has since been topped by just one player in a match in the 11 World Cups since. Sweden awaited on the second matchday, a game in which Jan Olsson famously became the victim of Cruyff’s soon-to-be signature move. The Netherlands’s star fooled Olsson, turned him inside-out and the ‘Cruyff Turn’ was born. Although the turn wasn’t followed by a shot, it was one of the 12 times Cruyff successfully dribbled past a Swedish opponent on the day. Only two players have managed to complete more take-ons in a World Cup match since, showing just how elusive Cruyff was in the game. Sweden may have stopped the Netherlands from scoring (0-0), but they secured their progress in the third game against Bulgaria. Cruyff was magnificent – again – by making the final pass leading to 11 of the Netherlands’ 23 non-penalty shots in the match. No other player has managed to create 11 goalscoring chances in a World Cup game since 1974, and Cruyff also won a penalty in the match against the Bulgarians. The captain assisted the Netherlands’ final goal against Bulgaria (4-1) as the Dutch won their group. Although Cruyff had thus far been involved in just one goal, the Dutch captain was leading the tournament charts for created chances (22), completed take-ons (25), touches in the opposition box (36) and passes into the opposition box (50). His talent was certainly shining through. Keeping these figures in mind, it was hardly a surprise Cruyff scored three goals and assisted two more in the games against Argentina (4-0) and Brazil (2-0). Between those victories, the Dutch team faced two obstacles in East Germany (2-0 win) and a late-night dive in the Wald’s Hotel swimming pool, but Cruyff’s abilities brought the Netherlands to their first World Cup final. Besides scoring and assisting goals, Cruyff’s value for the Dutch Total Football was expressed in his high tally of progressive ball carries – the number of times he moved the ball at least five metres upfield. The captain had the most progressive carries per 90 minutes at the 1974 World Cup (19.7), the most famous of which was the dribble leading up to the first penalty in the final, where opponents’ West Germany didn’t record a single touch of the ball until fouling the Dutch talisman. The 1974 World Cup final was 45 seconds old when Cruyff was fouled by Uli Hoeneß, after the forward drove with the ball from near the halfway line into the box. Johan Neeskens’ third penalty goal of the tournament – 86 seconds after kick-off – is still the fastest goal in a men’s World Cup final. Having scored three goals and assisted three more, plus his penalties won against Bulgaria and West Germany, Cruyff had a direct involvement in eight of the 15 Dutch goals to that point. However, in the remaining 88 minutes of the final, the Germans managed to hold off the Dutch star, allowing him to register just two key passes without firing a single shot – both tournament lows for Cruyff. West Germany had already turned the match in their favour before half-time, thanks to a penalty from Paul Breitner in the 26th minute and a 43rd-minute strike from Der Bomber Gerd Müller. The second half didn’t bring the Netherlands and Cruyff what some thought they deserved as arguably one of the best international teams ever.  And so it follows they’re widely regarded as one of the best sides to not win the World Cup. Cruyff created 36 chances for his team-mates during the 1974 World Cup, an average of 5.1 per 90 minutes. It’s an average that hasn’t been matched by other legendary players at their best, including Pelé (4.7 in 1970), Diego Maradona (3.9 in 1986) and Xavi (4.3 in 2010). A dozen of the goalscoring chances he created came following a ball carry, which was twice that of any other player in the tournament. The legendary performances of Cruyff in 1974 saw the Netherlands rise to the top world of football. Layer on top of his individual legend the much-adored Total Football Philosophy, and the memories of the second-place side in Germany will always remain a part of World Cup history. Almost 10 years before the 1974 World Cup, Cruyff made his league debut for Ajax in November 1964. He was 17 years and 204 days old, and it was the day he initiated the tradition of talented young Ajax players scoring in their club debut. He was certainly a promising young player, but the legend he would become was far from written. Cruyff won the Eredivisie a joint-high nine times (level with Danish PSV icon Jan Heintze) in the 12 seasons he spent in the division. He won it six times in the eight Eredivisie seasons between 1965 and 1973 with the last three complemented with European Cups. The Dutchman transferred to Barcelona in the summer of 1973, joining former Ajax coach Rinus Michels. After his move to Spain, Cruyff helped Barcelona win their first league title in 14 years. By scoring 16 goals, Cruyff finished the season as the club’s second-highest scorer and the fourth-highest in the league. In Cruyff’s absence, the Amsterdam giants won the league in just three of the eight campaigns between 1974 and 1981. His return in late 1981 brought Ajax silverware again with Eredivisie wins in 1981-82 and 1982-83. However, following a conflict with the board, Cruyff moved to Ajax’s eternal rivals Feyenoord. It was a seemingly impossible move for Ajax’s greatest player ever, and it was one that helped the Rotterdam side to their first Eredivisie title in a decade. Cruyff was victorious just about everywhere he touched a ball, winning 80% of the Eredivisie matches he played (245/308). Unsurprisingly, now six years after his death, that’s still the highest win percentage among players with 100+ appearances in Dutch top-flight history. That record may disappear one day, but Cruyff’s status as a pioneer of modern football won’t go with it. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our newsletter to receive exclusive content.

7660,Barcelona star Gavi hits back at journalist over criticism of teammate,"Barcelona defender Pau Cubarsi may only have played 7 games for the first team, and he may only be 17, but he is getting the full experience. The Blaugrana defence continues to look fragile, and now he is being publicly criticised.  Cubarsi went down after a supposed stamp from Granada goalkeeper Agustin Batalla in the box, but nothing was given. No contact was immediately obvious from the footage provided. On Cadena Cope, veteran journalist Paco Gonzalez did not hold back on Cubarsi, explaining that his father should pick him up and lay down the law for him. Which was not taken well by Cubarsiâs teammate Gavi, who was in the stands to watch the 3-3 draw as he recovers from his injury. Gavi replied to the clip of Gonzalezâs criticism on Instagram saying âPathetic is what you are, smarten up Paco.â  Cubarsi has certainly come into the side at a rough time,  as Xavi Hernandez desperately searches for the answers to their issues. In particular, his position on the pitch is perhaps the most exposed to criticism, perhaps with the exception of the goalkeeping position.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Barcelona-star-Gavi-hits-back-at-journalist-over-criticism-of-teammate/3300817,,12-Feb,all-football-app
3266,Liverpool star Salah responds to Barcelona transfer speculation,"Mohamed Salah says he is “happy” to hear that Barcelona want to sign him but insists he would rather stay at Liverpool. Recent reports in Spain claim that new coach Xavi is determined to bring the 29-year-old to Camp Nou as his side look to strengthen their attack. The Egypt international is in talks to sign a contract extension at Anfield, however, with his current deal set to expire in the summer of 2023. Although he is flattered by the interest from the Catalan team, Salah is determined to commit his future to Liverpool. “I read what was said about Xavi’s interest to sign me,” he said to Egyptian broadcaster MBC. ""This is something that makes me happy that a team like Barcelona is interested in me, but I’m happy in Liverpool and we will see what happens in the future. “At the moment, I prefer to stay in the Premier League as it’s the strongest league in the world."" Although Salah would prefer to stay in England, he has admitted that the decision may be out of his control, as he waits on the club and his agent to come to an agreement. ""I said it several times, if the decision is up to me, I want to stay in Liverpool,” he added. ""But the decision is in the hands of the management and they have to solve this issue. “There is no problem but we have to reach an agreement for the contract. It’s up to them. “Your financial value shows how much the club appreciates you and that they are ready to do anything for you to stay, but the decision itself is not based on those financial matters only. “There are things like the ambition of the team and the coach and what he wants to do with the team and the players he wants. These are all important points when making the decision."" Salah has been in consistent form for Jurgen Klopp’s team this term, scoring 19 goals and providing nine assists from 20 appearances in all competitions. The Reds are currently second in the Premier League and have booked their place in the knockout stages of the Champions League as confirmed Group B winners.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-salah-barcelona-transfer-speculation/blt8b5219fc2c76faf1,By Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

9466,Revealed: 3 signings Poch wanted Chelsea to make in winter window - he didn't get any (reliability: 4 stars),"Mauricio Pochettino has been left slightly frustrated after Chelsea were unable to make a single signing in the 2024 winter transfer window.As per the Daily Mail, the Argentine gaffer actually wanted Todd Boehly & co to strengthen three positions in his squad in January.Pochettino reportedly wanted a new left-back, potentially a brand new goalkeeper and also preferably a centre-forward to lead his line.He has chopped and changed his team all through the 2023/24 season so far because the gaffer can’t seem to find the right balance in his squad.Chelsea, like many other major Premier League sides, were not able to sign players in the winter transfer window because of the threat of breaching the Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).Instead, the Blues decided to send the likes of Armando Broja, Andrey Santos and David Datro Fofana on loan for the rest of the 23/24 season.Mauricio Pochettino uses one word to describe his start as Chelsea managerPochettino hints at what to expect from Chelsea in winter transfer window",https://tribuna.com/en/news/chelsea-2024-02-02-revealed-3-signings-poch-wanted-chelsea-to-make-in-winter-window-he-didnt-get-any-reliabi/,Uttiyo Scarnage,2024-02-02T07:59:00.000Z,Daily Mail
11289,Croatia vs. Belgium: Prediction and Preview,"This has been the Group F main event all along, but it’s taking on added meaning with the pre-tournament favourites Belgium in trouble with a 37.5% chance of progressing heading into their final match. Belgium have lost form at a terrible time at the World Cup with their place in the last 16 at risk against Croatia, but Eden Hazard still believes in their quality. The Red Devils were out of sorts in beating Canada 1-0 and were duly punished in their second match against Morocco, losing 2-0. That defeat ended a 13-game unbeaten run in group-stage games at the finals, although they have not lost consecutive such matches since a sequence of three in a row across the 1982 and 1986 tournaments. Another reverse against Croatia – who impressed in crushing Canada – would see them eliminated, while a draw may not be enough either. “We have to do better, we cannot deliver the performance we want [right now],” said captain Hazard, who also skippered Belgium to the semi-finals four years ago. “We have to show it on the pitch, that is what counts. We still have quality in the group and are here to win. “We lack confidence because of that last pass and that last dribble. We have to regain that confidence.” You must allow functional cookies to continue. That lack of confidence is particularly evident in the final third, with Belgium netting with just one of 19 shots. That conversion rate of 5.3% is their lowest at a finals since converting only three of 93 attempts in 1982 (3.2%). Concerningly, Croatia have had no such issues of late, with their four goals against Canada tying their World Cup record for a single match (also vs. Cameroon in 2014). The 2018 finalists have also won four of their past five group-stage matches, drawing the other, and their only defeats to fellow European nations in 10 World Cup meetings have been to France – in both 1998 and 2018. Kramarić was in inspired form against Canada, scoring twice before being substituted 17 minutes from time when he surely would have backed himself for a hat-trick. It was only the second World Cup brace by a Croatia player (also Mario Mandzukic vs. Cameroon in 2014). Through two matches, he leads the team in shots (five) and xG with his 1.05 mark accounting for a third of Croatia’s total: Lukaku has appeared for only nine minutes as a substitute so far at this tournament, but it is surely time for Belgium to turn to their main man. He has scored all three of the Red Devils’ goals across their past two meetings with Croatia – both of which they have won. But the reality is we’re highlighting a man with three touches at this tournament, and none of them have come in the penalty area: This is one of the most finely balanced matches of the tournament so far, according to the supercomputer. While Belgium are marginal favourites, given a 37.2% chance of winning, Croatia are just behind on 36.5%. Does that make a draw most likely? That result, which suits Croatia far better than Belgium, is rated at 26.3%.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2022/12/croatia-vs-belgium-world-cup-2022-prediction-and-preview/,Ben Spratt,01/12/2022 2:42,the-analyst
4685,Real Madrid sign Shakhtar teenager Vinicius Tobias on loan as they take advantage of Russia-Ukraine UEFA ruling,"Real Madrid have completed the loan signing of Shakhtar teenager Vinicius Tobias. The 18-year-old has joined until the end of the 2022-23 season, with Los Blancos having the option to make the move permanent at the end of the deal. GOAL understands the defender will go straight club's Castilla squad for the remainder of the 2021-22 campaign. Vinicius only joined Shakhtar from Internacional in January and leaves without having made a single first-team appearance. Russia's military invasion of Ukraine saw the teenager's debut delayed as football in the country was postponed indefinitely. UEFA responded by changing its transfer rules to allow European clubs to add two more players from Russian or Ukrainian sides. Madrid moved quickly to take advantage of that rule and snap up a player considered to be one of the leading talents of Brazil's next generation. The defender is a right-back, but can also operate as a centre-back and even as a winger, due to his physical stature, impressive pace and crossing ability. GOAL understands Madrid view him as a long-term solution at right-back and could potentially provide cover in that position in Carlo Ancelotti's first team from as early as next season.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/real-madrid-sign-shakhtar-vinicius-tobias-loan/bltba18b87c27cd8daf,Jorge C.

8218,Why Chelsea won't commit to the player everyone loves - Conor Gallagher,"Conor Gallagher wants to stay at Chelsea. Mauricio Pochettino wants Gallagher to stay. The resolution, therefore, appears rather simple.  The truth is far more complicated. Gallagherâs match-winning brace at Crystal Palace on Monday night has intensified the focus on the England internationalâs future. Re-signing the 24-year-old appears a no-brainer. The supporters love him. His team-mates loves him. More pertinently, his manager loves him. Privately, Pochettino has forcefully advanced the merits of agreeing a new contract for Gallagher with his superiors.   That will come as no surprise. A rare bright spark in what has been a mediocre campaign. Gallagher has captained the team regularly in the absence of injured duo Reece James and Ben Chilwell. Heâs made the most Premier League starts of any Chelsea player. Heâs been the standard bearer at the clubâs Cobham training ground, during a period that insiders say have fallen way short of what is expected. Pochettinoâs reliance on Gallagher is clear.  What isnât quite so definitive is how Chelseaâs hierarchy view Gallagherâs future. Pochettino has done what he can, but the clubâs failure to assemble a contractual package that would satisfy a player of Gallagherâs standing has led to uncertainty. Pochettino recognises the benefits: the infectious work-rate and tenacity. He also sees the intangibles: the exemplary attitude, his respectful and courteous nature. When Gallagher arrived in the Midlands to join West Brom on loan in September 2000, he took an instant decision to relocate from London. It was an assertive decision that impressed then manager Slaven Bilic. Loan moves often leave footballers in limbo in terms of living arrangements, but Gallagherâs decision to uproot left an indelible mark on those at the Hawthorns. It was that commitment that endeared him to those at Crystal Palace during his impressive loan spell there during the the 2021/22 season. âNot a moment's trouble,â said one leading football figure who has worked closely with Gallagher. So whatâs the problem? On the pitch, there remains some doubts. While he walks into a Chelsea team in its current state of flux, would he play regularly in a Blues side more in line with where they hope their future takes them? âHis work rate is unquestionable, his ability to hustle opponents and win the ball back is perhaps his most valuable asset,â said one well-placed source. âBut thereâs always been a doubt over the technical side of his game.â In deliberating whether to hand Gallagher his first England call up ahead of Qatar 2022, Gareth Southgate and Steve Holland identified his best attribute as coming off the bench to win the ball higher up the pitch rather than his abilities in possession.   So with that in mind it is, perhaps, understandable Chelsea are believed to be reluctant to go above their unofficial wage ceiling of around Â£150,000-per-week. In todayâs market, it is fair to say Gallagher is worth more than that wage, particularly if you consider fellow academy graduate Reece James, who signed his latest deal under the Todd Boehly/Clearlake regime, earns Â£250,000-per-week. Indeed, Chelsea could, like they did with James, make an exception if they really wanted to. The fact they havenât done so yet speaks volumes. Those close to Gallagher will tell you his next contract will be driven by the need to feel wanted, not money. But those advising Gallagher, who currently earns in the region of Â£60,000-per-week, would be foolish to undersell a midfielder who has an excellent chance of going to Euro 2024 this summer. Gallagher is entering the final 12 months of his current deal and Chelsea are private acknowledging his value will drop drastically between now and the summer. Chelsea would have entertained offers of between Â£50m-Â£60m in January. But his value may have halved by the time the summer window opens.    There is also the issue of the Premier Leagueâs profit and sustainability rules (PSR) to consider. Well-placed sources have indicated that Chelsea are flying uncomfortably close to the wind in terms complying with the regulations. In Gallagher - and striker Armando Broja who is currently on loan at Fulham - they have assets who will count as 100 percent profit on the PSR balance sheet. Chelsea have already shown they are prepared to sell their own to ensure their financial stability such as when Mason Mount departed to join Manchester United last summer.

Before the game, Liverpool fan Adrian Hayward staked £200 on Xabi Alonso scoring from his own half.

9470,Luka Modric's situation at Real Madrid 'getting worse',"Luka Modric's situation at Real Madrid seems to be getting worse by the day, Diario AS say. It's becoming clearer that Carlo Ancelotti doesn't want to rely on the veteran midfielder even with injuries hitting the squad. Modric has only played 34 minutes in Real Madrid's last three games in all competitions — vs Atleti (14 minutes), vs Girona (20 minutes) and Leipzig (0 minutes). The Croatian icon started and finished Real Madrid's 2-0 win at Getafe but he remains the fourth least-utilized outfield player at Real Madrid this season. Modric has featured in 27 games for Real Madrid this season but has only started 15 of those and has been completely left on the bench six times. The 38-year-old said before the start of the season that he's prepared to play three games a week, but that doesn't seem to be the case now, not necessarily by any fault of his. Judging by the way it's going, Modric may well be on his way out of Real Madrid in the summer.

3864,FIFA 23 Ultimate Team: How FUT chemistry works in new game,"EA Sports is leaving no stone unturned to make FIFA 23 the most exciting edition ever and it will be the final collaboration between EA Sports and FIFA after almost three decades of association. Ultimate Team continues to be one of the major attractions in FIFA as it delivers tons of exciting content from FIFA Icons to Heroes. To make FUT 23 it more exciting EA has brought in a number of changes that will provide a more refined experience to gamers.  EA Sports revealed the FIFA Ultimate Team deep dive trailer and chemistry has been completely revamped. Previously, simply selecting players from the same league or nationality would have boosted chemistry but now you can do much more than that. GOAL takes a look at how you can make the most of the new 'chemistry' changes in FIFA 23. Previously in FIFA 22, each player was given a rating out of 10 on chemistry and the team's chemistry would have been calculated out of 100. However, the overall chemistry, which is basically the combination of the individual and team chemistry, would have remained hidden. Now, this evaluation is a relic of the past as EA has reworked the chemistry calculation in FIFA 23. Let us take a look at the key changes before expanding.  Since the overall squad chemistry has been removed, the complete focus shifts to increasing the chemistry of individual players. The players can earn up to three chemistry points per match, and they will have a score from zero to three. Playing in a preferred position will not only help in increasing individual chemistry but also the chemistry thresholds of the club, country/region and league. Up to three additional chemistry points can be earned if you field maximum players from the same Club, Country/Region or League.  how the new chemistry system works on #fifa23 🧪 #fifa #ultimateteam #fut #fut23 #fyp  EA Sports suggests that you deploy the players in their preferred position as it will only gain and contribute to chemistry when they are in their preferred position. Playing them out of position will have zero value addition to chemistry and will play only at their base FUT Item Attributes.  It can also negatively impact the chemistry of other players who share the same parameters. For example, if we deploy Kylian Mbappe in an unnatural position he will no longer contribute to an increment to the chemistry thresholds for France, PSG, and Ligue 1, and might even impact adversely by moving everyone down by one chemistry point. However, to help gamers out EA Sports have included up to three alternative positions for all base players, such as bronze, silver, and gold, along with their preferred position.  Mbappe has been attributed with two other position such as LW and CF, along with his preferred position which is ST. You can now change Mbappe's preferred position using a position modifier item to one of the listed alternative positions. Once he starts playing in those alternative positions he will earn the same chemistry as his preferred position.  So alternative positions can help you out in FIFA 23! You will need a position modifier to change the preferred position of a player. It is a single consumable Item which helps a player change to an alternative position. If you change a position, their previous position will still be available in the list of alternative positions, which will help you to revert in the future.  The manager is an important factor in building chemistry as he will help increase by one point, the chemistry of players in the starting XI, if they belong to the same club, country/region or league of the manager.

8627,3 players who impressed in first half v West Ham — and 3 who should improve after break,"Arsenal are 4-0 up at half-time away at West Ham. Here are the players whose performances in the first half have stood out.Trossard. Always in the right space at the right time, finally got the goal which he deserved in added time. He's brilliant in that false nine position, also combining really well with his teammates. Arsenal play so much better with him leading the line.Rice. Took a corner leading to Saliba's goal and then a free-kick leading to Gabriel's strike. His metronomic passing has been helping Arsenal control the possesion immensely.Odegaard. Has been at the heart of almost every Arsenal attack so far today. Should have already bagged a couple of assists and will hopefully continue like that after the break.And here are the two players we haven't been particularly impressed with...Saka. Should have scored that free header in the 35th minute. Overall not particularly effective so far today, too many giveaways after unsuccessful dribbling attempts. Big thumbs up for scoring the penalty.Havertz. Not particularly involved in the game from his position in the midfield. Not clear what exactly he brings to the table when played in the middle of the pitch.Martinelli. Should have had an assist a couple of minutes before Saliba's opener but overall has been too quiet.

11841,"From Out in the Cold to MLS MVP: Dániel Sallói Talks Playoffs, Family and His Future","“It’s a league that really wants to push its stars. The players they push are the ones that come from big countries and the designated players. For me, I feel like I have to do more.”Tied fourth for goal contributions, tied fifth for goals scored, joint-top for non-penalty goals, this season Dániel Sallói has rediscovered the form that led many in 2018 to suggest he was one of MLS’ best prospects.In 2021, lining up for Sporting KC on the left of a front three, the 25-year-old Hungarian has been one of the most active and threatening attackers in the competition, tied eighth for attacking sequence involvements and first for shots following a ball carry.  Yet, despite these impressive numbers, there’s been an air of underappreciation around Sallói this season. When the MVP nominees were announced on Monday, Sallói was one of five up for the award, but throughout the year, pundits had been reluctant to truly put his name alongside the other candidates despite topping the goal contribution charts for much of the season. When betting markets were last open before the MVP vote, Sallói was only 11th favourite to take the crown.“It made me a little angry earlier this season when I was actually outperforming many players and it felt like I’d have to run away with it to be in the conversation,” Sallói explains when I put it to him. “But overall, I don’t really care because it’s all about winning the playoffs with Sporting KC.” Dual threat 😤@danielsalloi is a finalist for the Landon Donovan MVP Award AND Comeback Player of the Year.#SportingKC: https://t.co/VNHbCg0mJY pic.twitter.com/S0FBbPslaa Sporting KC haven’t won the MLS Cup since 2013 – the season before Sallói joined their academy – and have only made it to the semi-finals once in that time, despite having finished on top of their conference on two occasions. This Saturday SKC host Vancouver Whitecaps in the opening weekend of the playoffs, and Sallói has his eyes set on the big prize.“We’re 100% set on winning it,” says Sallói. “I think we’re in the top three or four teams in the league this season. In previous years we’ve struggled with injuries but that’s why I’m really excited about this year. We have to win four games to win the whole thing, and with a fully fit squad I think we can do that.”Last season, SKC were one of the favourites going into the playoffs equipped with their young starlet Gianluca Busio, now of Venezia, but a devastating 3-0 loss at home to Minnesota in the quarter-final put pay to any title challenge. Meanwhile Sallói watched on from the bench. After registering 16 goals in all competitions in 2018 at the age of 22, Sallói looked set to take MLS by storm in 2019, but things dropped off a cliff, scoring just one goal in 34 games and none in nine games in 2020. Last winter, rumours started circling that his time in Kansas may be up, with some wondering whether he had what it takes to remain in MLS.“I didn’t want to leave this club,” Sallói explains. “But I did start thinking, ‘maybe this isn’t working for me, maybe I need to try something new. A new system, new teammates, new coaches’, and that went through my mind, because I was 24, and I was trying to save my career.“Sometimes, though, slumps happen in a player’s career. Some people get over those bad games in a week, for me it was a whole year. But then because I didn’t perform in 2019, I didn’t get many chances in 2020. Then this season I was fortunate because we had a shorter roster, and the coach gave me another chance from the start to prove myself.”Prove himself he did. After opening his account by scoring the winner on Matchday 1, Sallói didn’t find himself out of the team until a knock kept him out in August. By this time, he’d rattled home 10 goals and assisted six more in 17 games.“Sometimes, if you score goals, it’s the best medicine. It gets you through all your problems. You can have a really bad game for 90 minutes, then score the game-winner and everyone will go ‘oh my God, he’s amazing’.“I need just keep my level this high. In 2018 I scored 16 goals in all competitions, this season I’ve done the same. I look at my teammates, like Johnny Russell, every year he brings 10 plus goals and sometimes 10 plus assists. And that’s what makes you a great player.”This season, only CJ Sapong and Hany Mukhtar, and Adam Buksa and Gustavo Bou have assisted each other for more goals than Russell and Sallói have in MLS. And it’s likely that neither of those pairings stamped through the car windshield of a departing player like Russell did of Gianluca Busio’s Mercedes while Sallói filmed on in August.The windshield breakage was accidental, and just one in a long list of pranks that have helped forge an unlikely bromance between the 32-year-old Scot and 25-year-old Hungarian. “It is a strange matchup,” admits Sallói. “But for some reason, from the first day, we became really good friends. We have the same sense of humour.“Maybe because we both played in Europe we understand each other a bit better too, and it shows on the field. We link up a lot and when your best friend’s scoring goals, it’s a really great feeling.”Another great feeling for Sallói came when he made his international debut against England in September. The game didn’t go perfectly, ending in a 4-0 loss for Hungary, but it gave him a taste of what it takes to play at the very top level.“I feel like I play in a good league in MLS, but against England it was very, very noticeable the difference. There’s barely any space, you have to have a perfect touch and if you make a mistake, you immediately lose the ball.“It made me think, if you play at that level every week, your career must change immensely. It was shocking to me, I felt like a little kid making my debut again for Újpest, looking around at all these world-class players.”It’s a level that Sallói aspires to be at. He knows one great season won’t get him to that level and he knows he needs to repeat 2021’s exploits again and again, but with age, he’s becoming more studious in his approach.“I study plays and I watch others to see how they solve certain situations. I’ve watched a lot of Riyad Mahrez highlights recently, looking at his movement and the way he takes the ball off the wing and beats defenders on both sides. He’s amazing at staying calm in those crucial moments.”It’s something Sallói has done a lot this season, drifting in from the wing onto his favoured foot with 32 of his 35 shots following a carry, and all but one of the chances he’s created coming from a dart from left to right.  “My Dad always told me to have ideas in my head. So it’s not that you’ll do everything perfectly, but when you get the ball, I have a picture of what I can do. So say I’m bearing down on goal, I can go ‘this is best for a fake shot, this I should hit first time’. But sometimes you have to work on instinct, and it’s a case of combining the two.”A former footballer himself for Videoton, Honved and Beitar Jerusalem, Istvan Sallói was the one who got his son the move to Sporting KC, getting in touch with a friend who worked at the club when Dániel was on a foreign exchange Kansas in 2014. In his season with the SKC academy, Dániel scored 21 goals in 28 appearances before returning to the club in 2016 after a season with Újpest in Hungary’s first division. Dániel remains indebted to his father but acknowledges he struggled under his presence growing up.“I wasn’t strong enough as a kid. You look to Dominik Szoboszlai for example, and he successfully survived his dad. It sounds bad but his dad almost tortured him to become the best, and this is why he is amazing and has all the qualities because his dad wouldn’t let him eat until he mastered it. “My Dad tried to do the same but I would start crying, I didn’t understand why he wanted to do that to me. But my dad has mellowed a lot and he’s proud that I went to America and made a career for myself. My conversations with him now are more friendly instead of ‘attacking’. We found balance and he still helps me with advice on and off the field.“But looking back, I wish I could have done the same as Dominik, because that’s the way you get places. He became a Navy Seal. I didn’t.”Sallói still has aspirations to make it in Europe, though. MLS is becoming more of a hotspot for European clubs to find emerging talent with the likes of Brenden Aaronson, Mark McKenzie, Joe Scally, Chris Durkin, Alberth Elis, In-beom Hwang and Reggie Cannon all having moved from MLS to Europe this year. Another year equal to 2021, and Sallói will perk the ears of suitors across the pond himself.“I’d like to try myself out in Europe, it’s something that interests me. I love the league, and I love America, it’s my second home, but I need to start planning out my career.“I’m 25, I still have time, and I would hate myself if I spent my career not trying to make the most of my talent.”Dániel Sallói may not have become a Navy Seal, but a motto of theirs that will ring true for him is “Never out of the fight.” This time last year, Sallói’s MLS future was in doubt. He’d scored one goal in nearly two seasons and was struggling to even make it off the SKC bench.Now Sallói is up for the MVP award after showcasing himself as one of the finest sharpshooters on American soil, and with the playoffs now upon him, he has a chance to prove it to all those who doubted him in the games that matter.From almost out of the fight, he is now very much at the heart of it. Mind your windscreens.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2021/11/from-out-in-the-cold-to-mls-mvp-daniel-salloi-talks-playoffs-family-and-his-future/,Tom Mortimer,16/11/2021 10:32,the-analyst
2378,Franco Carboni: Argentine teenager out to become Inter's new Zanetti,"When Argentina announced their squad for their final World Cup qualifiers in March, it raised plenty of eyebrows. Alongside the likes of Lionel Messi, Paulo Dybala and Lautaro Martinez were a series of relatively unknown names, for whom their first senior international call-ups were coming before their professional debuts. Not only that, but a number of those teenage talents were not even born in Argentina, with some, such as Manchester United forward Alejandro Garnacho, having previously represented other countries at youth level. For Inter full-back Franco Carboni, this was the first time that Argentina had come calling, having previously played for Italy Under-18s. But having been whisked away from Argentina almost overnight three years earlier, it was a dream come true to be recognised as being a prestigious talent by the land of his birth. ""I knew that the national team was following me here at Inter,"" the 19-year-old tells GOAL in an exclusive interview. ""When the call came, it gave me immense pride and emotion. It was a very beautiful experience. ""I thank Italy for the opportunity they gave me in some youth friendlies. They were very important experiences for me. ""But when the call from Argentina came, I had no doubts. It's my country, and it was my dream to play for the national team. ""Training with Messi? It really made my dreams come true. Something that I dreamed of as a child and that I experienced in that moment. ""Training with him, doing ball possession, but also eating at the table with him... Incredible things and difficult sensations to explain."" Born in Buenos Aires, Carboni's first taste of academy football came at Lanus, but he was forced to leave his homeland at the age of 16 after his father, Ezequiel, accepted the job of youth coordinator at Catania. ""Three years ago, when we moved to Italy overnight, I had to tell him and my family that we were leaving Argentina."" Ezequeiel, a former midfielder for Lanus and Catania, amongst others, recalls to GOAL. ""I know how much he suffered in leaving his friends, family, club and many other things to move to a country he did not know anything about, from the language to the football."" Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: Both Franco and his younger brother, Valentin, were enrolled into the Catania academy upon their arrival, but spent just five months with the club before bigger teams from around Europe began to take notice. With a cultured left foot, physicality that allows him to beat opposition players both through pace and strength, and with excellent decision-making ability, Carboni's talents were clear, and with clubs now understanding the importance of full-backs in the modern game, it is no wonder he soon became hot property. Liverpool and Juventus both showed an interest in signing him, but it was Inter who won the race, as the Nerazzurri also brought Valentin to Milan to join his brother. ""There were proposals from different clubs, but I've always wanted to play here,"" Franco says. ""The project that the club presented to my family was very good and we chose to come to Inter. ""Thank God it turned out to be the right choice!"" Carboni has shone since arriving at the Nerazzurri while playing in a variety of positions down the left-hand side. Initially a forward when he first began his footballing career, he has slowly moved backwards, and is now most comfortable playing as an attacking wing-back or full-back. He has become a key member of Inter's Primavera (U19s) squad that is managed by former defender Cristian Chivu, providing seven assists over the course of the 2021-22 campaign while catching the eye of Simone Inzaghi. He has been named on the first-team bench on five occasions over the course of the current campaign, though his first taste of senior football actually came with Antonio Conte's title-winning side in 2020, for whom he was a substitute twice in the early weeks of the Serie A season. ""I give thanks to Conte,"" Carboni says. ""I trained under him for four-to-five months with the first team and he put me on the bench for the first time in Serie A. It was a very nice experience and I thank him for the opportunity he gave me. ""Inzaghi has also put me to the bench, even in the Champions League. He gave me a wonderful experience and I also thank him."" The thought of an Argentine full-back roaming down the wing in the Nerazzurri shirt at San Siro instantly brings up memories of Javier Zanetti for Inter fans, and the five-time Italian champion has already offered advice to Carboni in his capacity as club vice-president. ""My role models? In Inter, it's always Zanetti, even if he played on the right and I on the left,"" Carboni says. ""For me, he is one of the best in history in that role and it is really a pleasure to talk to him. He is always very nice to me, he is a great person. ""In today's Inter team, I really like [Ivan] Perisic. Playing in the same role as him, I always observe him. I try to learn from him because, for me, he is very strong."" While Carboni's progress is encouraging, the issue of young players breaking into Serie A first teams is one that is not going away, with the issue having again been brought up again recently after Italy's failure to qualify for the 2022 World Cup. Of the 15 youngest players to appear in Europe's 'Big Five' leagues this season, only one – Carboni's fellow Argentina call-up, Lazio's Luka Romero – plays in Serie A, while only one Italian player under the age of 18 has played in the competition this season – Atalanta defender Giorgio Scalvini. The path to playing regular senior football for Carboni is not clear, then, meaning a potential loan move could be on the cards in the summer of 2022 after he recently extended his contract with the club through to 2025. ""Right now, I am thinking about finishing the season well with the Primavera,"" he insists. ""We have important game, such as the play-offs, which we want to win. ""Then, at the end of the season, we will evaluate with my agent and Inter the best choice for me. ""I always set myself short-term goals, but I dream of playing in the first team at Inter or in the first team at a Serie A club."" Carboni certainly seems on the right path to achieve those dreams, and after his week of training alongside Messi and the rest of the Argentina squad, he knows more than most that dreams do sometimes come true.

3780,USMNT star Pulisic picks which FIFA 22 rating he wants to be higher ,"Christian Pulisic has been casting an eye over his Next Generation card in FIFA 22, with the Chelsea and USMNT star of the opinion that a few of his numbers should be a little higher. The 23-year-old is being recognised as a star of the present and future, with an overall rating of 83, but there are areas of his game that he admits can be improved. He is happy with his ranking, which continues to head in the right direction, but feels EA Sports has marked him down in categories that he wants to prove a point in. When clear of niggling injuries, the American forward has shown across two-and-a-half seasons at Stamford Bridge that he is a force to be reckoned with on Premier League and Champions League stages. He has an English top-flight hat-trick to his name, while the target has been found on 19 occasions through 83 appearances in all competitions. While he clearly knows his way to the back of the net, Pulisic has only been given a 72 shooting rating on FIFA. He is a little disappointed with that, telling the Premier League’s official YouTube channel: “I think there is definitely room to improve there. I have scored some nice goals.” Pulisic added on his jumping rating of 79, as someone who can dunk a basketball: “I think it should be a bit higher. Growing up in the States, I played every sport and I think that helps in my all-round athleticism.” Another area that Pulisic feels he has been unfairly overlooked in is the defensive department, where he scores just 38. He said of that score, as he forms part of a Chelsea side that is expected to defend from the front under Thomas Tuchel: “I think I do pretty well defensively. As an attacking player it’s normal, but it could be higher. Our team, everyone defends very well. That seems a bit low.” Pulisic went on to say of his lowly 60 physical rating: “That is low. I’m not the biggest guy, maybe I need to get in the gym a bit more. I think I have a low centre of gravity and am hard to knock off, the ball but maybe I need to get my arms a bit bigger.” A man that joined Chelsea from Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2019 believes certain qualities in his game have been recognised in the latest FIFA offering, with speed an obvious strength. He said of his 90 rating in the pace department: “I’m not mad about that at all.” Quizzed on whether he could beat 91-rated team-mate Timo Werner in a race, Pulisic added: “I never like to doubt myself. I think it would be close, but to be honest Timo is fast.” Another high score comes in the dribbling department, where the U.S. international is given a mark of 87. He said of his creative ability: “I think that’s one of my biggest strengths. We could try and get it to 90, but I’ll take that.” On his 75 passing score, Pulisic went on to say: “We’ll take it. Maybe I need to show them some more flashy passes. Maybe I’m too simple, I need to no-look and stuff like that.” Overall, Pulisic is pleased with his FIFA 22 card, but is eager to reiterate that there is one area that he would like to see improve dramatically in the coming years. He said: “I think I would change shooting and bump that way up. They went a bit high with the dribbling and pace and then low with the shooting!” Chelsea, with just one win from their last four games across Premier League and Champions League competition, will be back in action on Saturday when they play host to Leeds.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/usmnt-pulisic-fifa-22-rating-wants-higher/blt27fb13a289479ba4,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2554,Is any football played on Christmas Day around the world?,"For many fans, festive football is as much a part of their Christmas tradition as exchanging gifts and having a Christmas tree. While some leagues such as the Bundesliga break over the winter, in England, the festive period is packed with fixtures – never more so than on Boxing Day, December 26 (though the day was severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021). Football on Christmas Day used to be a staple of the season, starting – as with many Christmas traditions – during the Victorian Era. Now, all of the major leagues around Europe are quiet on December 25. But is football played anywhere in the world? GOAL takes a look. Generally speaking, no league football is played in Europe or North America on Christmas day. However, a number of leagues continue with matches on December 25, generally in countries where Christmas is not as widely celebrated. There are league fixtures scheduled for December 25, 2023 in Turkey, Egypt, Algeria, Iran and Thailand. While predominantly non-Christian countries such as most of those above would have no reason to stop the football calendar for Christmas Day, the heavily Roman Catholic Bolivia stood as an outlier in 2019. In that case, it was a response to a heavily delayed football calendar. Political protests and marches disrupted Bolivian football to the point that the league season, which had been scheduled to finish on December 11, finished on December 28 instead, with games taking place on December 25. Formerly an annual Football League tradition, the last fixtures to be played on December 25 in England were in 1959. There were only two games on that day - Blackburn beat Blackpool 1-0 in the old First Division and Coventry beat Wrexham 5-3 in the third, the latter fixture providing more in the way of merriment. However, league football carried on in Scotland for a little longer. The last time a full round of fixtures was scheduled on December 25 was in 1976, though many games were postponed due to the weather. It was five years previous to that when a full round of Scottish top-flight fixtures was played on Christmas, with Celtic and Rangers both winning that day in 1971.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/is-any-football-played-on-christmas-day-around-the-world/1g1i0qtwhv8db16sz0e3vhghki,Sam France,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10101,Lucky Charms: Which Players Have Never Lost While Scoring a Premier League Goal?,"Logically, scoring a goal helps your team win. But who are those players that have taken that to the extreme and have never lost a Premier League game while netting? Behold, these are the league’s lucky charms. First, a quick cautionary tale. We’ll get onto the Premier League’s lucky charms in a few moments. But pour one out for the top-flight’s most unlucky player: Huddersfield Town and Brentford’s Zanka, who has ended up on the losing side in all four of the games he’s scored in to date. Or Matt Le Tisser, who scored in 79 games across his Premier League career, but still lost a staggering 32% of those matches. Scoring and winning isn’t for everyone. But here’s the list of the players that have scored in the most individual games without losing a single one of them. Aside from his four Premier League winners’ medals, Gabriel Jesus is the owner of another enviable league record. His 73 Premier League goals have come in 60 different matches, but the real kicker? In every single one of those 60 games he’s scored in, his side have never lost. Of course, it helps that Jesus has exclusively played in exceptionally dominant sides. That’s why he’s managed to speed up this list so quickly, despite playing just 202 matches in the competition. 159 of those came for Manchester City who Jesus joined in the summer of 2016-17 – the same window that saw Pep Guardiola arrive. Now he’s in north London having moved to Arsenal in the summer of 2022-23 and after narrowly missing out on adding a fifth Premier League title to his personal honours list in his debut season at the club, 2023-24 still offers a chance of glory. At present, Jesus has a 91.7% win rate in games that he’s scored in – that includes Arsenal’s 2-1 victory away at Nottingham Forest on Matchday 22 of this season. Only two players to have scored in 20+ games without losing can better that feat (Pedro 96.3% and Antonio Valencia 95.7%) James Milner always appears in these lists, doesn’t he? When he’s not appearing in the list for the youngest Premier League scorers of all-time, or those who’ve made the most appearances, he appears in ones like this. Milner has scored in 54 games across his Premier League career in spells at Leeds United, Newcastle, Aston Villa, Manchester City and Liverpool. Only Jesus has scored in more games without losing a single one of them. Mr. Reliable does it once again… but he’s still yet to score for current side Brighton & Hove Albion in the competition. Darius Vassell scored 52 Premier League goals across 265 appearances for Aston Villa and Manchester City. Those goals came in 46 games and Vassell remained unbeaten in every single one.   Vassell did find himself on the losing side after scoring for Leicester City in their 3-2 loss to Nottingham Forest in April 2011 but thankfully for him this came in the Championship and not the top flight. His place of this list is safe. Of course, you don’t have to lose a game for footballing heartbreak to find you as Vassell knows all too well. After England’s 2-2 draw against Portugal in the quarter-finals of Euro 2004, Vassell missed England’s last spot-kick in the penalty shootout, allowing Portugal’s goalkeeper Ricardo to score the winner. Rather than that painful memory, perhaps we ought to remember Vassell more fondly for being Aston Villa and Man City’s lucky charm over a large chunk of the noughties. Last season was a frustrating one for Diogo Jota. He was only able to play 33% of league minutes for Liverpool (1,131) in what was an injury-interrupted campaign. Just over halfway through this season, Jota’s nearing that minutes tally already, while he’s already beaten his total of seven Premier League goals in 2022-23 with eight this term. That’s good news for Liverpool, with Jota being one of the most luckiest players in Premier League history. His total of 44 games scored in without losing is only beaten by three players, and the 27-year-old has time on his side.  Overall, the Portuguese has scored in 32 different league games for Jurgen Klopp’s side and hasn’t been on the losing side once. His time on Merseyside got off to a flying start, with Jota not only becoming the first player since Robbie Fowler to score as many as seven goals in his first 10 appearances, but the first Liverpool player to score in each of his first four Premier League home games. Jota also scored in 12 different matches for Wolves during his time at Molineux and wasn’t on the losing side with them either. That’s perhaps a slightly more impressive feat given Jota’s first season in the top flight came as Wolves had just been promoted. There’s never going to be a goals-based record that Erling Haaland isn’t in the mix for, and this one is no different. The Manchester City man has scored in 32 separate Premier League games, with his side winning 27 and draw five of those. What’s frightening about the Norwegian’s record here is just how quickly he’s jumped into the top five of this list. He’s actually joint-fifth, tied with Salomon Kalou (below), but while Kalou’s goals came over a 156-game career, Haaland has made just 50 appearances in the competition at the time of writing. Haaland joined Man City in the summer of 2022 and played a critical role in their continental treble, breaking the record for the most goals scored in a single Premier League season along the way. Pep Guardiola’s side have never lost when Haaland has notched and, given their domestic dominance, we can expect him to race up this list.  Salomon Kalou is another striker blessed to have played in a dominant team during his Premier League days. Although he won just one Premier League title with Chelsea over his six-year career in west London, he was still part of the team that won both the FA Cup and League Cup in 2006-07 as well as finishing second in the Premier League, and part of the side that finished second, third, first and second in the four subsequent seasons. Kalou – who had been brought to the club by José Mourinho after impressing with Feyenoord in the Eredivisie – only hit double figures for league goals in one season (2010-11), but whenever he scored Chelsea were safe. He notched in 32 games for the Blues, winning 29 of those and drawing three. That’s the top six, but how about a look at the other players to have scored in 20+ Premier League games and not taste defeat. As mentioned, Pedro (96.3% win rate) only failed to win one of the games he scored in across his English top-flight career (a 1-1 draw against Burnley in February 2017 for those wondering). Given his youth and the team he plays for, Arsenal’s Gabriel Martinelli could quickly climb up the list, while it’s good to see Everton’s reliable skipper Seamus Coleman make an appearance. Oyvind Leonhardsen: 28 Games Scored In (W21 D7) Pedro: 27 Games Scored In (W26 D1) Gabriel Martinelli: 27 Games Scored In (W23 D4) Antonio Valencia: 23 Games Scored In (W22 D1) Georginio Wijnaldum: 23 Games Scored In (W19 D4) Marcos Alonso: 23 Games Scored In (W17 D6) Seamus Coleman: 22 Games Scored In (W17 D5) Enjoy this?

11829,The Analyst Diary – November 22,"If you want evidence that the Premier League’s top three sides may be a cut above the rest, then a glance at that old-fashioned yet telling metric, goal difference, is informative. Chelsea are on +26, Manchester City +19 and Liverpool +24. West Ham, a team famous for rarely ending top-flight seasons having scored more goals than they let in, are on +9 and then after that it’s Palace on +1, Wolves on zero and 14 teams with a negative figure. West Ham have ended the season with a positive goal difference only once (2015-16*) in their last 28 top-flight seasons*final season at Upton Park so the scriptwriters went easy on them This sounds like it might be a rare situation and an exhaustive look through the football records books confirms that it is. To have as many as 16 teams with a goal difference of +1 or lower 12 games into a campaign has happened only once in English top-flight history, back in 1973-74. People didn’t even care about GD in those days as it was still the slightly confusing goal average era, but just like this season, Manchester United were in a difficult moment. By the end of ’73-74, United had been relegated, just six years after being the champions of Europe. Although they did allow their goalkeeper Alex Stepney to take and score two penalties, something certain managers at contemporary Manchester football clubs could take on board. 13 games into the 1973/74 season, Manchester United had only scored 10 goals 😕Their joint-top scorer? Goalkeeper (and penalty-taker) Alex Stepney 👀🤷‍♂️🎥 #TooGoodToGoDown📅 Wednesday🕥 10.30pm📺 BT Sport 1 HD pic.twitter.com/vKscrfeMkZ This time last season English football was philosophically asking itself “how many penalties is too many?” after a combination of VAR and handball interpretation saw them being handed out at a rate that would have resulted in 300 across the season at one point. It slowed down as the season progressed, although the 125 spot-kicks was still a Premier League record. This season, however, the Premier League has seen fewer penalties awarded than any of the other big five leagues. Instead, the home of the penalty is undoubtedly Serie A, which has seen 61 so far, or 0.48 per game and only 16 fewer than the division saw in the entirety of 1994-95. Finally, spare a thought for Ligue 1 goalkeepers who have not made a single penalty save yet this season. Of the 41 spot-kicks taken, 38 have been scored with the other three sent off target, two of them by Nice’s Amine Gouiri. Just hit the target, son, you don’t need to worry about the keeper. At the start of November The Analyst Diary flagged up Morecambe’s Cole Stockton and his propensity to score from long range, so it wasn’t entirely surprising to see him score an outrageous winner against Fleetwood from just inside his own half. The winner of the League One goal of the month award for September, he now surely has November’s award wrapped up as well. A 94th-minute winner… from his own half! 😳#EFL | @ShrimpsOfficial pic.twitter.com/04pzkeV0lG To put his long-range antics into some sort of context, he has now scored more very long-range league goals this season than Harry Kane and Lionel Messi have combined from anywhere on the pitch. As well as containing one of the most pleasant airports in Europe, Toulouse is also the current home of former journeyman English striker Rhys Healey, who once made four appearances in the Premier League for Cardiff City. Toulouse signed Healy last year from Milton Keynes, which does not contain one of the most pleasant airports in Europe, and in his first season in Ligue 2 he scored a respectable 14 goals in 32 appearances. This season, though, he’s gone up a level and already has 12 goals, four of them coming on Saturday against Sochaux, in a 4-1 win that sees Toulouse maintain their promotion charge. Keep up this form and the club could win Ligue 2 for a fourth time and in 2022-23 Rhys Healey could be sharing a pitch with Lionel Messi.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2021/11/the-analyst-diary-november-22/,Duncan Alexander,22/11/2021 8:35,the-analyst
8888,Xavi's Leaving Barcelona – Is Arteta the Best Option to Replace Him?,"Hey there football fans! The football world was rocked recently by the news of Xavi Hernandez's departure from Barcelona, leaving fans wondering who will step up to fill his shoes.  With speculation swirling, one name that has emerged as a potential replacement is none other than Mikel Arteta. But is the former Arsenal midfielder the best option to lead Barcelona into a new era? Let's dive in and explore. The Xavi Legacy: A Tough Act to Follow First things first, let's talk about Xavi. As one of the greatest midfielders of his generation, Xavi's influence on Barcelona and the game of football as a whole cannot be overstated. With his vision, passing ability, and tactical intelligence, he was the heartbeat of the Barcelona midfield during their golden era, playing a pivotal role in their numerous successes. But with Xavi now departing for new challenges, Barcelona find themselves in need of a manager to lead the team forward. The question is: who can possibly fill the void left by such a legendary figure? Arteta: The Apprentice Becomes the Master? Enter Mikel Arteta. The former Barcelona youth product may not have enjoyed the same level of success as Xavi during his playing career, but he has certainly made a name for himself as a manager. After hanging up his boots, Arteta transitioned into coaching and quickly caught the eye of Arsenal, where he served as Pep Guardiola's assistant at Manchester City. In 2019, Arteta returned to Arsenal as the club's head coach, tasked with reviving a struggling team. While his tenure at Arsenal has had its ups and downs, there's no denying the impact he has had on the team, leading them to FA Cup glory and instilling a more cohesive playing style. The Barcelona Connection: A Return to Roots What makes Arteta such an intriguing candidate for the La Liga Barcelona job is his connection to the club. As a product of La Masia, Barcelona's famed youth academy, Arteta understands the club's ethos and style of play better than most. His time spent under the tutelage of Guardiola at Barcelona and later at Manchester City has also given him invaluable experience and insights into the tactical nuances of the game.  With Barcelona in need of a fresh start and a return to their identity as a possession-based, attacking team, Arteta's footballing philosophy aligns closely with the club's values. His emphasis on tactical discipline, fluid passing, and pressing fits seamlessly with the Barcelona way of playing, making him a natural fit for the job. The Challenges Ahead: A Steep Learning Curve Of course, taking charge of a club of Barcelona's stature comes with its own set of challenges. The expectations are sky-high, and the pressure to deliver immediate results can be overwhelming. Arteta will need to prove himself capable of handling the demands of a top-tier club and navigating the complexities of managing a star-studded squad. Additionally, Arteta's lack of experience as a top-level manager could be cause for concern. While he has shown promise during his time at Arsenal, he is still relatively inexperienced compared to other candidates who may have more extensive managerial resumes. Conclusion In conclusion, while Mikel Arteta may not be the most obvious choice to replace Xavi at Barcelona, he certainly brings a unique set of qualities to the table. His deep understanding of the club's culture, coupled with his tactical acumen and coaching pedigree, make him a compelling option to lead Barcelona into a new era. However, only time will tell whether Arteta is up to the task of filling the shoes of a legend like Xavi and guiding Barcelona back to the summit of football. For now, the footballing world waits with bated breath to see what the future holds for both Xavi and Barcelona, and whether Arteta will indeed be the man to usher in a new era of success at Camp Nou.",https://tribuna.com/en/news/mancity-2024-02-08-xavis-leaving-barcelona-is-arteta-the-best-option-to-replace-him/,Alex,2024-02-08T10:30:05.000Z,
458,Gakpo likes Arsenal 'a lot' as Man Utd & Liverpool-linked PSV star reveals Premier League transfer dream,"PSV winger Cody Gakpo has admitted that he likes Arsenal “a lot” as the 22-year-old continues to be linked with a move to the Premier League. The Gunners, Manchester United and Liverpool are all rumoured to have an interest in signing the Netherlands international in the summer transfer window. Gakpo, meanwhile, revealed that he has been enquiring about England's top flight and that an Arsenal legend was among his heroes while growing up. “Everybody wants to play one time in the Prem,” the attacker told The Sun. “I don’t favour one team but I like Arsenal a lot. “I looked up to [Thierry] Henry when I was younger because he was a tall guy who played on the wing. “The Premier League is a big league. Virgil van Dijk plays there with Liverpool so I like to watch them. We are not the same kind of league but I think we try to look at the Prem and learn about it. “If I can make a step to a team who plays in the Champions League every season, of course it is my dream. But I still have a contract. Maybe there comes a club I cannot say no to. “Maybe they won’t come and I have to stay but for now I just want to keep working on this season.” Regarding the conversations he has had with his Netherlands team-mates, he added: “I played with [Steven] Bergwijn, Denzel [Dumfries] and Donyell Malen. When I see them with the national team we speak about how it’s going at their clubs.  “Stevie is playing in the Prem [with Tottenham] and doing well. He has given me his advice about the league and told me how it feels to play in the Prem because I was curious about other countries.” Gakpo will have the chance to showcase his talents to an English audience when PSV take on Leicester in the Europa Conference League quarter-finals. Ahead of Thursday's clash at the King Power, he said: “[Leicester] have some really good players.  “We are going into the first game to win. We can show them how good we are. Personally, I will need to bring my best performance.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/gakpo-arsenal-man-utd-liverpool-linked-psv-premier-league/blt494024699e9824b0,Stephen Crawford,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2502,Mbappe stay at PSG didn't surprise Herrera: 'A Parisian boy who wants to make history',"Ander Herrera claims Kylian Mbappe’s decision to sign a new contract at Paris Saint-Germain should come as no surprise as he is “a Parisian boy who wants to make history”. It appeared at one point as though that pursuit of a place in football folklore would lead the World Cup winner away from his native France, with Liga giants Real Madrid making no secret of their interest. An expiring deal at Parc des Princes looked to be playing into the Blancos’ hands, but Mbappe brought the intense speculation regarding his future to a close in May when committing to fresh terms with the reigning Ligue 1 champions. Questions were asked of why Mbappe decided to stay put, having already achieved plenty in the French capital, but Herrera feels the 23-year-old will not consider his work at PSG to be done until he becomes the club’s all-time leading scorer and helps to land an elusive Champions League crown. The Spanish midfielder told COPE : “Mbappe’s decision is in line with what I thought would happen. “If he had left, I would not have been surprised, but being the greatest footballer in the history of the club, the best scorer of all time, being able to obtain the long-awaited Champions League for him, it is a huge motivation. “I understand the greatness of teams like Madrid but you have to respect a Parisian boy who wants to make history at his club.” PSG CONFIRM KYLIAN MBAPPE STAYING 🇫🇷 pic.twitter.com/2KXz8PsxmH While Mbappe will be sticking around at PSG for the foreseeable future, there have been rumours to suggest that Herrera could be edging his way towards the exits. The former Manchester United star is tied to a deal through to 2024, but he faces fierce competition for places at 32 and has seen a return to his homeland speculated on. Herrera is aware of the gossip but insists there is no substance to it, saying of his own plans: “My family is happy and I want to continue here. “We know that the press here likes to talk about PSG a lot and I know how it works. In every market, my name comes out and nothing changes. I'm happy and the idea is to stay here. “We know that in football it's difficult to make things 100% secure, but the idea is to continue. “It sells a lot to talk about PSG. My group of friends tell me what's coming out, and I read a lot of things that are not happening. “I understand that there is no news every day, and the press has to talk about something.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mbappe-stay-psg-herrera/blt8a094b5b942bec31,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8769,Klopp explains why Chelsea beat Liverpool for both Caicedo and Lavia: 'That's how it went',"Chelsea beat Liverpool in the transfer race for both Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia in the summer. The Reds had a £111m bid for the Ecuadorian accepted only for him to wait for a Blues offer and move to the Bridge. Liverpool were the favourites to sign Lavia but the Belgian chose Chelsea over the Reds as well.“We were interested in Bellingham and realised it would not happen,” Jurgen Klopp said, as quoted by the Independent when asked about how both moves collapsed.“The whole market for No 6s went up. Two No 6s left our club [Henderson and Fabinho]. The market heated up. We thought we could maybe do Caicedo. We’d already done Mac Allister before. So we went in, he had an emotional agreement already with Chelsea and Pochettino. Then Lavia had his own reasons. So we were there.“If one of the £100m [targets] had worked, there’s no chance to do another. So that door was open. That’s how it went. That’s what I meant when I said we are so lucky. Everything in the ‘if not’ scenario worked out.”Speaking earlier this season, Klopp joked that he was 'lucky' that neither Caicedo nor Lavia signed for his club, considering Liverpool are first in the Premier League table. He's explained his comments.“It was this night, I come in the stadium, the kids are playing and crowd is cheering - I forgot for 10 or 15 minutes I am a public person. So I thought: ‘Oh no, that will create a lot of headlines’,” he added.Klopp on Chelsea beating Liverpool to Caicedo & Lavia: 'God, we were lucky'",https://tribuna.com/en/news/chelsea-2024-01-31-klopp-explains-why-chelsea-beat-liverpool-for-both-caicedo-and-lavia-thats-how-it-went/,Aleksei Blokhin,2024-01-31T07:30:26.000Z,Independent
10595,Going Places: Ipswich Town’s Resurgence Under Kieran McKenna,"Ipswich Town have made a brilliant start to life back in the Championship under young manager Kieran McKenna. Could they achieve back-to-back promotions and return to the Premier League for the first time since 2002? There aren’t many managers with a higher stock in England right now than Kieran McKenna. The Ipswich Town boss has led his side out of League One and judging by the start they’ve made to 2023-24, they look well on course to be battling for a return to the Premier League. Since he took charge for the first time on 29 December 2021, no club in the top four tiers in England have won more league points than Ipswich (160), while they are the only non-Premier League club to have played at least 10 EFL games and secure more than two points per game on average across this period (2.08). Only Pep Guardiola (48) has won more league games in the top four tiers of England than McKenna (46) since his first Ipswich game. Ipswich Town and McKenna are going places. It’s also only Guardiola’s Man City side who have been more productive in front of goal (159 goals) than the Suffolk outfit (147) since the 37-year-old manager’s arrival, including an exceptional 101 goals on the way to finishing as runners-up to Plymouth in League One last season – just the 14th team to score 100+ goals in a season in the top four tiers of English league football since 1967-68. They couldn’t have hoped for a much better start to life back in the second tier since relegation in 2018-19. They are level on points with top side Leicester City, who were a Premier League club last season, only behind them on goal difference. The goals haven’t dried up despite moving up a league, either. Only rivals Norwich City have scored as many goals as Ipswich (17), but McKenna’s side lead the Championship metrics for non-penalty goals (17), shots (146), shots on target (51) and expected goals (15.3). In short, McKenna’s side clearly haven’t been afraid to carry their attack-minded philosophy from League One up to the Championship. McKenna’s accomplishments at Ipswich so far are made more impressive considering he is the youngest manager in the top four tiers of England, aged just 37 years and 132 days old on Saturday when they won against Blackburn at Portman Road. He wasn’t even alive when Ipswich won the UEFA Cup under the legendary Bobby Robson in 1981 – that happened five years before he was born. He’s already taken the club out of League One – can he make it back-to-back promotions and lead Ipswich back to the Premier League for the first time since 2002? Despite their excellent attacking metrics, Ipswich haven’t dominated the ball this season. In fact, they are mid-table in the Championship for average possession (47.8%, ranked 15th), successful passes per game (344, 14th) and open-play sequences composing 10 or more passes (62, 15th), while just 10 of those sequences have ended in either a touch in the opposition box or a shot – fewer than 13 other sides. This isn’t far departed from their style in League One. Although they led the third tier for both possession (59.8%) and successful passes per game (380) last season, their pass frequency isn’t very different this season – it’s just that the quality of opposition has improved so much that their averages rank lower. If Ipswich had averaged the same number of successful passes per game that they have in the Championship this season (344) when they were in League One last season, they would still top the League One 2022-23 ranking. The quality of opponent in the Championship this season hasn’t seen them disregard their playing style at all – far from it. That’s also the case with their hard work off the ball. Ipswich have focused on what they do without the ball and on making it as hard as possible for the opposition to transition from defence to attack. They lead the Championship for shots following high turnovers of possession (20), while only Leeds United (84) have successfully turned possession over within 40 metres of the opposition goal-line more often than Ipswich (82). They are also among the best sides for not allowing opponents to settle in possession this season – only five sides have a PPDA (opposition passes per defensive action) lower than Ipswich’s 11.1. This intense defensive work high up the pitch shows a continuation from their successful League One campaign last season, when they led the league for shots following high turnovers (62) and had the second lowest PPDA (10.7) behind only Bolton Wanderers (9.6). Not only were they an attacking force to be reckoned with on the way to League One promotion last season, they also conceded the fewest goals (35) and kept the most clean sheets (23). So far in 2023-24, no side has kept more clean sheets than they have (4), while seven of their 10 goals conceded came in games against Leeds United (4) and this weekend against Blackburn Rovers (3). Impressive in defence as well as outstanding in attack – a decent route to success, generally. McKenna’s Ipswich side have lined up in a 4-2-3-1 formation this season, with George Hurst as the striker, Conor Chaplin in the number 10 role, Nathan Broadhead on the left and Wes Burns on the right. In the Championship this season, only Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (3.98) has a higher open-play xG assisted total than either Burns (2.68) or Broadhead (2.17). Burns is your archetypical wide forward, often staying out on the right flank. Only Sorba Thomas (43) and Jack Stacey (42) have attempted more open-play crosses in the Championship this season than Burns, while he also ranks third in open-play chances created (18), behind the excellent Leicester midfielder Dewsbury-Hall (23) and Plymouth’s Finn Azaz (19). He’s only created two more chances from open play than teammate Broadhead (16), but it’s the 25-year-old left-sided player that arguably causes opponents more headaches with his ability to drift inside onto his right foot. With two players that operate on opposite sides of the attack having such different styles, it often makes Ipswich’s front four look a little lopsided in terms of how they create chances – Burns frequently attacks the byline and looks to provide crosses in open play, while Broadhead rarely does that. Broadhead’s movement and propensity to cut inside from the left means that Ipswich feature inside the top six clubs in the Championship this season for both open-play crosses (112, 6th) and proportion of attacking touches in the central third of the pitch (29%, behind only Plymouth and Leicester). This is made possible by the speed with which they transition and get forward in attack, build possession in central areas through Massimo Luongo and Sam Morsy, then feed the ball wide to the danger men. Chaplin plays as more of a ‘withdrawn forward’ in this Ipswich setup but is still the most prolific shooter in the league with 39 shots in 2023-24. He also topped the shot charts in League One last season (161) on the way to scoring 26 goals from attacking midfield – a tally that only Jonson Clarke-Harris was able to replicate across the division (also 26, excluding play-offs). Previously deployed in a striker role, Chaplin’s ability to drift into dangerous central areas between 12 and 20 yards out is fed by Burns and Broadhead’s vision, making him one of the most dangerous attacking players in England outside the Premier League. Chaplin’s threat and impressive goal tally wouldn’t be what it is without the unselfish Hirst leading the line as the number nine in McKenna’s side. Before this season, Hirst had played 949 minutes at Championship level without a goal from 39 shot attempts, including half a season on loan at Blackburn last term before moving to Ipswich on loan. Under McKenna, Hirst rediscovered the form that saw him net 13 goals the previous season at Rotherham on their way to promotion from League One, scoring six times for Ipswich in the second half of 2022-23. Hirst isn’t an out-and-out goalscorer, but his physical 6-foot-3 frame causes untold problems for opposition defences, while his clever movement creates space for attacking teammates like Chaplin, Broadhurst and Burns to exploit – the reasons why Ipswich made his move from Leicester City permanent this summer. Following a 0-0 draw at Bristol Rovers on 14 February last season, Ipswich Town found themselves in fourth place, but eight points off automatic promotion having played a game more than second-place Sheffield Wednesday. Then came an astonishing run of form. McKenna led Ipswich to 13 wins and two draws across their final 15 matches of 2022-23, winning seven more points than any other side and doing so in style – they outscored their opponents 45-4. Overall, in addition to their eight Championship games this season, Ipswich Town have lost just one of their last 27 matches in league competition (W21 D5 L1). Since the start of their excellent form on 18 February – a run that began with a 4-0 win over Forest Green, only Arsenal and West Ham (25) have used a smaller spread of players across the top four tiers of ever-present clubs, while only Newcastle (21) have started fewer players than Ipswich (26 players used, 22 players started). Even then, those three Premier League clubs have all played one league game fewer than Ipswich over that timeframe. Eight of Ipswich’s players have started at least 20 of their 23 league games in that run, with Chaplin, Cameron Burgess and Luke Woolfenden starting every single one. To have such a consistent squad despite moving up a league in the middle of the run is testament to the quality of the squad that McKenna has built in Suffolk. Of course, it should be mentioned that he’s been backed financially by the Ipswich board, with the club having one of the biggest budgets in League One last season and higher than several clubs in the Championship this season, too. Despite this, Ipswich’s summer spend was relatively low – only four players were bought for a fee in the last transfer window and of those, just Jack Taylor and Hirst have appeared for the first team in the Championship this season. Starting as well as Ipswich (and Leicester) have in the English second tier is rare. Since World War II, there have only been 14 previous instances of a side winning 21 points or more from their opening eight games (based on three points for a win) across 77 seasons. Of those 14, 10 have gone on to win promotion to the top flight that season. There are a few cautionary tales for Ipswich to try and avoid replicating from this century. Watford in 2000-01 (9th), Burnley in 2001-02 (7th) and Reading, most recently, in 2020-21 (7th) all finished outside the play-off places in the Championship after winning at least 21 points from their first eight games of the season. Ipswich’s start to 2023-24 is the best by a newly-promoted side in the second tier in EFL history, however. Based on three points for a win, the previous record was 20 points, set by Blackburn in 1980-81, Brighton in 1977-78, Swindon Town in 1963-64 and Barnsley in 1946-47. So, following their exceptional start to the season, can McKenna lead Ipswich back to the Premier League? Winning successive promotions from the third tier to the top flight is a difficult task, with only 10 previous instances of this happening. Just four of these have happened in the Premier League era, with Watford the first to do so in 1997-98 and 1998-99, before Manchester City did it in 1998-99 and 1999-00. Ipswich’s rivals Norwich City also did this in 2009-10 and 2010-11, before Southampton became the last team to win back-to-back promotions from League One to the Premier League over 2010-11 and 2011-12. Ipswich were a Premier League club in the first three seasons of the competition following its inception in 1992, before returning in 2000 following four years in the second tier. After an excellent first season in which they finished fifth and qualified for Europe, they suffered relegation in 2001-02 following an 18th-place finish. They haven’t been back since, but McKenna might just be the man to complete the resurgence and get them back into the top flight. Enjoy this?

396,Ederson reacts to viral image of Man City goalkeeper crouching down close to halfway line during Manchester derby & explains why he did it ,"Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson generated some surprising headlines on the back of a derby win over Manchester United, as he was pictured crouching down on halfway as the Red Devils struggled to get anything going at the Etihad Stadium, but the Brazilian insists his actions were “perfectly normal”. Ederson has always been a sweeper keeper for the Premier League champions and is widely heralded as one of the finest number ones around when it comes to dealing with balls in the air and on the deck. With that in mind, he is not averse to roaming well outside of his penalty area, as he did against United, and insists that too much is being read into him supposedly disrespecting local rivals by highlighting just how toothless they became in the second half of a 4-1 defeat. Ederson told reporters when asked if City needed a keeper against United: “I've seen that image after the game. I've been in that position various times, whether it is a corner or throw-in I always look to play high up to shut down a counter by the opponents. “It's something that I do a lot in games and sometimes people don't really notice. As it was a derby more people noticed. “That's the way I play, Pep asks me to play high up and there are a lot of games where you play more with your feet than your hands but you need to be prepared for everything. “Sometimes it could be a counter for our team as well if there is a better passing option. It's perfectly normal and something we've been doing very well.” With City becoming a dominant force in domestic and continental football, Ederson has many outings in which he has little to do. He has grown accustomed to that and claims to have mastered the art of keeping his concentration when it would be easy to let his thoughts wander. “It is difficult to concentrate in games when I don't see much of the ball but I always look to be constantly communicating with my team-mates,” Ederson added. “A lot of the time I talk to my team-mates after the game that I'm tired. A game where I don't make many saves I'm tired mentally because the mental tiredness is more tiring than the physical tiredness. “Concentrating for 90 minutes is difficult, I do it better these days due to my communication with the rest of the team.” City will be hoping to enjoy another quiet evening on Wednesday when they take in the second leg of a Champions League last-16 encounter with Sporting that they currently lead 5-0 on aggregate.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ederson-reacts-viral-image-man-city-goalkeeper-kneeling/blt5dae1ac1efde52dd,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

10208,AFCON 2023 Preview: Group D,"We look ahead to Group D at AFCON 2023 with our group stage preview. Algeria will look to make up for a terrible showing at the last edition, while Burkina Faso have made the semi-finals in three of the last five AFCON tournaments. Mauritania and Angola are the outsiders, but will be hoping to cause an upset. At the last Africa Cup of Nations tournament, Algeria served a masterclass in how not to defend a title. The Fennecs were unrecognisable from the team that slalomed to the 2019 trophy, due to being predictable as well as having a lack of freshness in the squad. It has also been suggested that being unbeaten in 35 games as of January 2022, Djamel Belmadi’s team were obsessed with besting Italy’s 37-game world record. “They seemed to be playing for a draw, rather than going for a win,” notes football journalist Oluwada Lotfi. That group stage exit was the wakeup call required, and the engines have been rebooted, bidding goodbye to veterans like 2014 BBC African Footballer of the Year Yacine Brahimi. There now seems to be a deliberate tilt toward youth, with just five notable players in this year’s AFCON squad over the age of 30: Sofiane Féghouli (now more box-to-box than attacking midfielder), Riyad Mahrez, Islam Slimani, the combative Baghdad Bounedjah and defensive stalwart Aïssa Mandi. Longstanding first choice keeper Rais Mbolhi, 37, who was approaching his 100th cap, got injured just as the final squad was announced. He’s replaced by Saudi-based Moustapha Zeghba. French Ligue 2 shot-stopper Anthony Mandréa, whose performance in a September friendly was commanding, will be in goal. Algeria have tried to fix notable flaws that allowed Sierra Leone, Equatorial Guinea and Cote d’Ivoire to gut them on the counter at the last AFCON. Belmadi, who was a bundle of nerves on the touchline at the last tournament, has to be calmer this time. At the 2021 AFCON, Algeria scored just one goal from shots totalling 4.9 expected goals (xG) in their three group stage games as they were sent home early. Their 2.2% shot conversion rate was only better than Guinea-Bissau and Mauritania (who didn’t score at all). A stickler for using a back four, the manager is expected to go with full-backs Youcef Atal of Nice and Wolverhampton Wanderers’ Rayan Aït-Nouri. Both are attack-minded but can be caught out defensively. Mandi is past his best, but Belmadi stubbornly sticks with him at centre-back. However, this defence has now conceded just eight goals in their last 19 games. There’s a quiet confidence returning to this hungry team. The Fennecs played 10 games in 2023, winning seven and drawing three. Key among the wins was a morale-boosting 1-0 away victory against reigning African champions Senegal, who had not lost at home in nearly 10 years before the game. Former Manchester City star Mahrez has lost none of his magic despite taking his talents to Saudi Arabia, and he’s a sure starter. Across the 2023-24 Saudi Pro League, the 32-year-old has both created the most chances for his Al-Ahli teammates in the competition (60) and has the highest expected assists (xA) total of 7.9. Despite Mahrez’s talents, the loss of Algeria’s top scorer in qualifying, Mohammed Amoura, to injury mid-December is a huge blow. He had 13 goals in 15 Belgian top-flight games for Union Saint-Gilloise before being sidelined. Goals, then, will have to come from veteran striker Slimani (the former Leicester City forward who now plays in Brazil with Coritiba) and the Qatar-based Bounedjah. The physically solid duo of Ismaël Bennacer (only just returning from a lengthy knee injury in December) and Nabil Bentaleb could man defensive midfield, while the experienced Sofiane Feghouli partners Youcef Belaïli just behind the main forwards. In 2015, Belaïli was controversially suspended for testing positive for cocaine, but since his return, has exploded. Algeria coach Belmadi trusted him when no one else did, and he’s now one of the highest paid players in Africa. Indeed, added to Feghouli and Belaïli, the team has two other players ready to slot in, depending on the opposition: Hicham Boudaoui (closer to Bennacer in style) and the exciting Farès Chaïbi from Eintracht Frankfurt, whose offensive midfield talent means he’ll be in a top tier European club soon.  Look out also for Zinéddine Belaïd in central defence, one of the top defenders playing in Africa today. He may not start ahead of Mandi and Dortmund’s Ramy Bensebaïni, but he’s been ready for the big time for a while. Algeria know that despite finishing with 16 out of a possible 18 points in the qualifiers, they are far from guaranteed to bulldoze their way to a third AFCON title. At a time when many African nations are hoovering players up from the diaspora, Burkina Faso have stubbornly looked to homegrown options. Until fairly recently, it was common to have a significant number of key players of the national team, the Stallions, sourced from home. The explosion of well set-up private academies in the country (and in neighbouring Ivory Coast) that continue to churn out quality youth players means this practice will continue for a while longer. Local media have begun labelling the team ‘nearly men’, and it’s not hard to see why. In 2013, they lost 1-0 to Nigeria in the final and reached the semi-finals in 2017 and 2019. Led by a coach determined to exorcise his own AFCON demons, could Burkina Faso charge their way into the last four once more? Hubert Velud was probably thrilled at the good fortune of leading Togo’s most accomplished football generation, which included Emmanuel Adebayor, to the 2010 AFCON. That was before gunmen attacked the team bus two days before the tournament kicked off, leading to the team’s withdrawal.  Eleven years later, Velud was sacked by the Sudanese football federation on the eve of AFCON 2021 – despite qualifying them. The team had recorded a string of poor results in the months leading up to the tournament. Now, having qualified the Stallions for this edition, the 64-year-old is faced with mutiny from within. The heads of the country’s powerful Premier League clubs have been lobbying for his sacking since October. They accuse him of – in the words of ASFA Yennenga president Armand Béouindé – “nothing new and nothing fresh since he replaced [former coach] Melo Kamou.” Keep in mind that Melo was asked to step aside after a semi-final finish in Cameroon. Still, as we head into AFCON 2023, there has been no cogent reason given. As it stands, the only person standing in the way of a sacking for the Frenchman is the President of the Burkina Faso Football Federation, who took the bizarre decision to axe the very popular Melo Kamou. Bertrand Traoré remains the leader of the team, even though he’s barely had any playing time with Aston Villa this season. He is one of those players who assume god-like status when they pull on the national team kit. Even at 80% match readiness, he’ll likely start. In the last few months, Velud gave the 28-year-old limited minutes; yet, his goal and two assists contributed to the four point-haul to leave the team second in World Cup qualifying. There is always a temptation to play Traoré upfront, but at the last AFCON he flopped in that role and thrived when shunted to the right side of midfield. A better option will be Toulouse’s Mamady Bangré or Abdoul Tapsoba. Velud has played a fluid 4-4-2 that morphs into a 4-3-3 to good effect, keeping the direct, counter-attacking style Burkina Faso are known for. Hervé Koffi remains the preferred goalkeeper, while Edmond Tabsoba and captain Issoufou Dayo will be at centre-back. Abdoul Guiébré is usually at left-back and Luton Town’s Issa Kaboré is expected to make a return from injury in time to feature at right-back. Bayer Leverkusen star Tabsoba is one of the best defenders in Europe at carrying the ball out from defence – no defender in the Bundesliga this season has averaged more ball carries (27.7) or more progressive ball carries (14.8) per 90 than he has. France-based Gustavo Sangaré has played well when partnered with Blati Touré, Ismahila Ouédraogo and Bertrand Traoré midfield. Rising star Dango Ouattara (Bournemouth) is a certain starter in most games. More than decent options on the bench include Tanzania-based Stephane Aziz Ki, an incredibly exciting prospect: a technically sound metronome capable of some wizardry in central midfield. Adamo Nagalo – who we picked as one of our AFCON players to watch – is being groomed to replace the slowing Dayo, whose lack of place is targeted by smart opponents. All in all, fans of the Stallions will likely aim to finish second in the group behind Algeria, after which the permutations could favour them towards another berth in the last eight. From there, it’s anyone’s game. Before anything, let’s wish Algeria, Burkina Faso and Angola good luck in their group games against Mauritania’s goalkeeper, Babacar Niasse. He’s 6-foot-5 and barely needs to stretch his arms to snatch balls from corners and free kicks. Teams will need to be clever against the 27-year-old Guingamp shot-stopper. Niasse is part of a team that continues to be one of the most fascinating stories in recent AFCON history. Only a decade ago, Mauritania were regularly forfeiting international football matches due to a lack of commitment or dearth in talent. The story, now, is starkly different, and the country now considers AFCON qualification something of a must-have. At the last AFCON, they included then 16-year-old midfielder Beyatt Lekweiry, which signaled their confidence in their emerging young players. He did not make it to Ivory Coast this year, but plenty of young talent will have their chances in this Les Mourabitounes team that is making a third successive tournament appearance. The mentality of this team is worth noting, having managed qualification despite being docked three points and three goals for fielding an ineligible player against DR Congo. They managed 10 points from six matches, two points behind group winners, DR Congo. Following the building of basic football infrastructure and other ancillary investments through the FIFA Forward programme, it should take about 10 years for Mauritania to produce a steady stream of homegrown talent. For now, the plan has been to get as many Senegalese-Mauritanians as possible into the national team. As many as 16 of the current squad were eligible to play for Senegal. Meanwhile, in coach Amir Abdou, they have found a man who specialises in punching above his weight. It was he who led Comoros to their first AFCON in 2021, where a famous victory against Ghana sent them to the last 16. That’s what he’s known for. Less mentioned is the fact that he was coaching Mauritania’s biggest club team, FC Nouadibhou, at the same time as coaching the Comoros national team. In charge since March 2022, Abdou aims to improve on the work of former Mauritanian coaches Didier Gomes and Corentin da Silva from the last two tournaments (one goal and no win in 2019, no goals and no win in 2021). Mauritania’s recent performances have burnished Abdou’s reputation as a no-nonsense, team-first approach kind of guy. There are several decent players, but the team is heavily reliant on the collective rather than individual brilliance. That said, three players can be called the stars of the team. One is Hemeya Tanjy, one of the most expensive transfers from the Mauritanian domestic scene after he was acquired for just over $1 million by Libyan side Ittihad Tripoli from FC Nouadibhou. He scored twice in qualifying. He usually partners another star player, former Fulham striker Aboubakar Kamara. The team’s top scorer in qualifying with three goals, he is the captain and the most technical player in the squad. A reliable source of goals, it was his strike that sealed qualification for AFCON 2021. Together with Tanjy, they scored more than 100 goals in the local league before going abroad. The third big name is the recently-emerged Aboubakary Koïta, who was top scorer in the Belgian top flight (until recently) with 11 goals. He famously admitted to opting for the land of his mother’s birth because “my father’s country [Senegal] was taking too long to notice me.” Look out for his dead ball abilities as well. Souleymane Anne, who was a teenage forward in the team’s 2019 AFCON debut, is now mature enough to play a more impactful role from the bench. TP Mazembe right-back Ibrahim Keita can also lay claim to being one of the best in Africa, and his offensive forays should be key. Entertaining football should not be expected from Les Mourabitounes, but a hardworking, all-running side should. Historically, the Pelancas Negras have huffed and puffed, but rarely brought the house down. Their status as the archetypal mid-level African team was underlined when coach Pedro Gonçalves described the team as “the weakest in [Group E].” To say this in a group that includes Mauritania gives an insight into the realities of the two-time quarter-finalists. It’s actually a minor miracle that they are making their return to the tournament considering the array of organisational problems besetting them in the last few years. Indeed, local media generally believe that finishing second in qualifying (with nine points) behind Ghana was only possible because Central African Republic (seven points) and Madagascar (three points) were not very good. A lot of credit must go to Gonçalves, who has huge respect in the country. The Portuguese started from Angolan club football a decade ago, where his Primeiro de Agosto side played delectable attacking football. His scouting eye convinced authorities to make him the Under-17 national team coach, and he rewarded them with a round of 16 berth at the 2019 U17 World Cup. Making the step up for the senior team has not been easy for Gonçalves, and his mix of youth and experienced players is not consistent. There has been a lot of experimentation as he has looked for a reliable core, and like many teams at recent AFCONs, Angola have also looked at diasporan players to shore up the talent pool. Several of the squad heading to the AFCON are also eligible to play for neighbouring DR Congo through family ties. A major setback was the withdrawal of Fiorentina attacker M’bala Nzola in December in what is thought to be a career decision. “He did not want to risk losing his place at the club,” says football analyst Jose Sardinha. Some have said that the 27-year-old checked out because he was not confident about the quality of preparation and facilities from the football federation. The team is in transition, and a noticeable area to improve is scoring. Since September, the team has managed just two goals in seven games (as of the time of publishing). Blessed with a number of flamboyant players, this team badly needs goals. They managed just six goals in six qualifying matches, which is why the decision not to call up locally based Gilberto (Petro Atlético) was baffling. A very direct attacking midfielder, he is not afraid to take on opponents and progresses the ball well. For those in the squad, the Ligue 1-based Jérémie Bela is favoured. He opted to play for Angola at 28 once he realised he was unlikely to get a place in the DR Congo team – and it’s not hard to see why. Bella shoots a lot but does not often score, in addition to being technically limited. Angola have gone with a back three in recent qualifiers. Based on those games, expect the excellent shot-stopper Neblú in goal, and the back three to consist of Jonathan Buatu, Núrio Fortuna and star defender Kialonda Gaspar. For full-backs, Tó Carneiro, a workaholic not afraid to bomb forward with good link-up play, will be on the left while Loide Augusto is on the right. The experienced duo of Fredy and Manuel Cafumana (known by all as ‘Show’) as well emerging star Manuel Keliano could be in midfield. Upfront is Gelson Dala, who dazzled for Angolan giants Primeiro de Agosto and was a target of several top African clubs after scoring 23 goals in 27 games – helping them win the Angolan top flight title in 2016. He signed for Sporting CP in Portugal, where he played just once in three years for the first team. After being bounced around on loan a few times, he has been in Qatar since 2021. There’s always a buzz whenever he’s on the ball, because he is exciting. He is likely to partner Cagliari’s 21-year-old Zito Luvumbo, named among the world’s best 60 young players of 2019 by The Guardian. Mabululu, with six goals in seven Egyptian Premier League games for Al Ittihad Alexandria in Egypt, is yet to translate that form for the national team and will likely come off the bench. This will be Angola’s ninth appearance in the African Cup of Nations, and they are expected to have another underwhelming tournament. Want more AFCON preview content?

4115,'Did they win the World Cup?!' - Neymar mocks Argentina celebrations after Messi's team sings about Brazil,"Brazil star Neymar poked fun at Argentina's Finalissima victory celebration this week after Lionel Messi and Co. marked their win over Italy with a song pointed directly at their continental rivals. The Albiceleste thrashed Italy 3-0 on Wednesday to lift the CONMEBOL-UEFA Cup of Champions, a competition between the winners of the Copa America and European Championship which has been reintroduced this year after two previous editions. But Messi's Paris Saint-Germain team-mate and friend thinks their festivities were a little premature given that the big prize comes later this year in Qatar. Following the clash at Wembley, the Argentina squad flooded social media with celebratory posts and photos posing with the trophy. One of the players to make himself heard was Nicolas Otamendi, who revealed the Albiceleste's new dressing room song aimed at their rivals. ""Brazilians, what happened?"" the chant ran. ""The five-time champion bottled it! Messi went to Rio and left with the Copa [America]."" In response, Neymar had his own barbed opinion to share, replying: ""Did you win the World Cup?"" Despite the online back and forth and historic rivalry, Neymar in fact enjoys a warm relationship with Argentina. His friendship with Messi and fellow PSG man Leandro Paredes is well known, and after July's Copa defeat the forward was seen chatting freely with both men in the Maracana. Argentina and Brazil are next scheduled to meet in September, when they will play the World Cup qualifier that was suspended last year in acrimonious circumstances.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/did-they-win-the-world-cup-neymar-mocks-argentina/blt3efce492b2053e76,Daniel Edwards,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Here is what some Barca fans think about it.💭 Shuaibu: ""I would take him any time and he's gonna succeed with his style of play. Passing, high press, high game tempo and attack-minded play are his strengths since his coaching debut in the Bundesliga. He's a great coach, but Laporta and Deco know better.""💭 barcelonafan: ""The man made Liverpool a formidable force again. If he could do this for Barcelona, it would be even a greater achievement with this set-up.""💭 Neal: ""I didn't see any clear and obvious replacements for Xavi, but Klopp leaving Liverpool instantly changes the entire dynamic. We're legitimately talking about one of the best managers on the planet here.""💭 FCB Albiceleste: ""Klopp leaving Liverpool and available. Xavi almost certain to leave Barca end of the season. A perfect storm seemingly brewing. There'll never be a better chance for Barca to get a top-notch coach like Klopp any time soon. This is it, Laporta somehow needs to make it happen.""💭 Xabhi: ""Klopp, Flick, Nagelsmann. If we get any one of them, we'll be saying goodbye to the Barca style of play for a while. They are all gegenpressing monsters. A good portion of our squad will be thrown out too because they aren't fit enough to play that style of football.""💭 James: ""Apart from the whole, he needs a break I cannot even think of him dealing with the politics and bulls**t around the job. I'd love it, but would need a lot of people around the club to put away their egos to work with a coach like him coming in.""💭 hazfcb_: ""Klopp says he's running out of energy.

892,Firmino responds to Liverpool transfer talk & links to Serie A giants Juventus,"Roberto Firmino continues to generate exit talk at Liverpool, with Serie A giants Juventus said to be keen on acquiring his services, but the Brazil international says his intention is “to stay” at Anfield. The 30-year-old frontman is into the final year of his contract with Premier League heavyweights and has seen the likes of Darwin Nunez drafted in to eventually fill his boots. No extension to his terms on Merseyside have been discussed, meaning that he could hit free agency in the summer of 2023, but the South American insists he is not pushing for a move and would be happy to spend the new campaign prolonging his association with the Reds. Firmino has been on Liverpool’s books since 2015, with 328 appearances taken in across seven years. He has 98 goals to his name, leaving him just a couple short of a century, and intends to stick around at a club that has allowed him to claim Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup and Club World Cup winners’ medals. A proven performer has told TNT Sports of his future plans: “I love this team, this city and the fans. I'm here. I want to stay of course.” Roberto Firmino found a celebration and he's sticking to it 🕺 pic.twitter.com/fE7TWzJlsY The Reds may have been tempted to cash in on Firmino while they still can, especially after investing in Nunez as another No.9 to lead their line, but Jurgen Klopp has stated that he intends to keep an experienced figure in his plans. The German tactician has said when asked about the Firmino transfer rumours: “Bobby is crucial for us, the heart and soul of this team, the way we played in the last years was only possible because of Bobby. “That’s why I’m really happy he was able to train for the majority of the time here in pre-season so far. Everything looks really good so I am absolutely fine. “There is no doubt about Bobby’s quality. All the rest we will see how this year goes but he is essential for us.” Firmino started the 2022 Community Shield for Liverpool, with Nunez replacing him in the second half as the Uruguayan found the target in a 3-1 victory over Manchester City.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/firmino-responds-liverpool-transfer-talk-links-juventus/blte5133c88924e5dd4,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2149,Mane takes Afcon trophy to bed as Mendy and Senegal team-mates dance through hotel after final win over Egypt,"Sadio Mane took the Africa Cup of Nations trophy to bed with him while Edouard Mendy and the rest of his Senegal team-mates danced through their hotel corridors following their final win over Egypt. Senegal finally landed their first-ever Afcon crown on Sunday, exorcising the demons of their previous final defeats in 2019 and 2002. Mane was the hero on the night as he fired home the decisive penalty in his country's shootout victory against Egypt, and the Liverpool striker celebrated by taking the trophy back to his hotel room. Mane, who also scooped the Player of the Tournament award after recording three goals and two assists in seven games, took to social media to show himself lying in bed with the gold-plated cup. The 29-year-old also had his gold winners' medal around his neck as he turned in for some sleep early and left the rest of the Senegal squad to keep the party going at their hotel in Cameroon. Chelsea keeper Mendy also took to Instagram to offer a peek into their celebrations as the players were seen singing and dancing through the corridors late into the night. Mane's night didn't start out as he hoped, with the Senegal star's seventh-minute penalty saved by Egypt goalkeeper Gabaski - who appeared to take advice from his Liverpool team-mate Mohamed Salah about which way to dive. Chances were at a premium thereafter but Mendy, who scooped the Goalkeeper of the Tournament award, kept out an effort from Mohanad Lasheen to ensure the game went to extra-time and Gabaski produced three smart saves from Bamba Dieng in the additional 30 minute period. Penalties were eventually needed to decide the contest and after Mohamed Abdelmonem and Lasheen missed for Egypt, Mane stepped up to score the winning penalty, with Salah left disconsolate after being denied the chance to take one.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mane-afcon-trophy-bed-mendy-senegal-dance-hotel/blt2960493e0d40a273,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10199,Ivory Coast vs Guinea-Bissau Prediction and Preview,"We look ahead to the opening match of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations with our Ivory Coast vs Guinea-Bissau prediction and preview. The 34th edition of the CAF Africa Cup of Nations kicks off on Saturday, with hosts Ivory Coast taking on Guinea-Bissau at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium in Abidjan in Group A. It’ll be their 100th AFCON game, so they’ll be looking to celebrate reaching the century with a strong performance in front of their own fans. On the only previous occasion that Ivory Coast hosted AFCON, they exited in the group stage (1984), so a win in this match would ease worries about them repeating that disastrous tournament finish. History shows they are strong starters, with Ivory Coast unbeaten in their last 12 opening games at an AFCON tournament (W7 D5). Their recent form suggests that they aren’t shy of goalscorers in their side, either. They have scored 16 goals in their last three matches, with a 9-0 win over Seychelles and 2-0 win over Gambia in World Cup qualification followed up by a pre-AFCON friendly win over Sierra Leone (5-1).  Ivory Coast automatically qualified for AFCON 2023 as hosts, but they had to take part in qualifying anyway, finishing runners-up in Group H ahead of Comoros and Lesotho. They finished the group with 13 points from their six games, with their draw against Lesotho being the only point Lesotho earned in qualifying, and their single loss coming against group winners Zambia. Ivory Coast have previously participated at AFCON 24 times, a number only bettered by Egypt (25). They have been crowned champions twice, in 1992 and 2015. Both finals were against Ghana and both finished 0-0 after extra-time, then going to penalties. The 1992 final was the first major international final penalty shootout in which every player for both teams took a spot kick. Ivory Coast’s last AFCON appearance was again decided by a shootout after a goalless draw, but one which they were on the wrong end of, losing 5-4 to Egypt in the round of 16. Guinea-Bissau have failed to score in their last seven matches at the AFCON, a record for any team in the history of the competition. In total, it’s been over 11 hours since they last found the net (707 minutes). Their final warm-up game for this tournament did see them score twice, but their defence was breached six times in a 6-2 friendly loss to Mali on 6 January. Guinea-Bissau qualified for AFCON 2023 as runners-up in Group A, ahead of Sierra Leone and São Tomé and Príncipe. They got 13 points from their six matches, and were the only team in the group to take points off rampant group winners Nigeria. In fact, it was a Nigerian 95th-minute winner against Sierra Leone which secured Guinea-Bissau’s qualification to this tournament on 18 June 2023. Before 2023, Guinea-Bissau have qualified for AFCON three times, those being the last three tournaments (2017, 2019 and 2021). They have thus far failed to progress from the group stages, but finished all three tournaments with the same record – fourth in the group with one draw and two losses. This will be the first encounter between Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau at the Africa Cup of Nations. Tournament hosts Ivory Coast are backed to start their 2023 AFCON campaign with a victory by the Opta supercomputer. They won 59.0% of pre-match simulations, compared to 20.4% won by Guinea-Bissau, while 20.6% of games ended in a draw. In the week leading up to AFCON 2023, our pre-tournament predictions had Ivory Coast on a 12.1% chance of winning the competition behind favourites Senegal and ahead of Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Nigeria and Cameroon. Below are their current, up-to-date chances of progression through AFCON 2023 according to the Opta supercomputer: Ivory Coast: Charles Folly, Yahia Fofana, Badra Ali Sangaré, Evan Ndicka, Wilfried Singo, Ousmane Diomande, Ismaël Diallo, Sèrge Aurier, Odilon Kossounou, Ghislain Konan, Willy-Arnaud Boly, Seko Fofana, Jean Seri, Franck Kessié, Idrissa Doumbia, Ibrahim Sangaré, Lazare Amani, Max Gradel, Jérémie Boga, Simon Adingra, Oumar Diakité, Jean-Philippe Krasso, Sébastien Haller, Jonathan Bamba, Christian Kouamé, Nicolas Pépé, Karim Konaté Coach: Jean-Louis Gasset Guinea-Bissau: Ouparine Djoco, Jonas Mendes, Fernando Embadje, Sori Mané, Marcelo Djaló, Fali Candé, Jefferson Encada, Edgar Ié, Opa Sanganté, Nanu, Prosper Mendy, Nito Gomes, Dálcio, Zidane Banjaqui, Janio Bikel, Moreto Cassamá, Mauro Rodrigues, Alfa Semedo, Famana Quizera, Carlos Mané, Mama Baldé, Marciano Sanca, Zé Turbo, Carlos Gomes, Zinho Gano, Franculino Djú Coach: Baciro Candé Enjoy this?

1724,"Dortmund need Reyna back, says Kehl, as USMNT star takes part in training after injury","Borussia Dortmund director Sebastian Kehl revealed that Giovanni Reyna is taking a bigger part in team training, while affirming that the club cannot wait to welcome the USMNT star back following injury.  Reyna has been unavailable since September, when he picked up a hamstring injury on international duty.  The teenager's absence has been felt keenly by BVB, who went out of the Champions League at the group stage and have fallen behind Bayern Munich in the race for the Bundesliga. “Gio had a good early phase this season, he played outstanding games in the diamond,"" Kehl explained in an interview published on Dortmund's official website. ""He moves cleverly between the lines, but also pulls from the outside in, radiates a goal danger and carries a shrewdness in himself. We want him back again.  ""It was a difficult phase for him, but he's stable again. He takes part in parts of the training, that will increase over the next few days.  ""The boys need that, they want to play football and have fun.""  The son of former Premier League and USMNT star Claudio Reyna, Gio began his youth career in New York City FC's academy before moving to Dortmund in 2019.  He made his first-team debut the following year at the age of just 17 and has been an established part of the BVB set-up ever since, racking up 69 appearances and 10 goals in all competitions to date.  Reyna had begun the 2021-22season in fine form, netting twice in Dortmund's opening three Bundesliga games before injury left him on the sidelines.  The initial prognosis was positive, but in November Marco Rose admitted that the muscle problem was more complicated than first believed.   “It’s slowly getting better,"" the coach signalled. “The injury turned out to be a bit more serious than we expected. “It is not possible for me to predict when he will be back in team training. But we hope that he will be able to play again this year.” Further reading ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/dortmund-need-reyna-back-says-kehl-as-usmnt-star-takes-part/blt5c2fb526c4e7b342,Daniel Edwards,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2914,The Villarreal miracle: How have a team of Premier League cast-offs reached the Champions League semi-finals?,"When Villarreal line up for the Champions League anthem at Anfield on Wednesday, and the television camera pans across their players’ faces, many will be recognisable to regular Premier League viewers. Unai Emery’s Yellow Submarine has been propelled to the semi-finals by several players who have plied their trade in England’s top flight, many of whom struggled there. While the team has a Spanish spine, from striker Gerard Moreno to midfielder Dani Parejo and centre-back Pau Torres, several of those around them are a hodgepodge mix of Premier League cast-offs, forged into a cohesive unit on Spain’s east coast. It is a tight ship which has seen off Juventus and Bayern Munich to reach the Champions League’s business end, and will now face off against Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool. Tottenham alone are highly represented in the Villarreal squad, with Giovani Lo Celso on loan, while Serge Aurier, Etienne Capoue and Juan Foyth all have history in north London. So too does midfield battler Francis Coquelin, at Arsenal, while arguably the Groguets’ (Yellows, in Valenciano) player of the season, Arnaut Danjuma, arrived from Bournemouth, in the Championship. Villarreal knock Bayern Munich out of the Champions League 😱 pic.twitter.com/7KOBRIlBDd Alberto Moreno, sadly out with a long-term injury, was having a fine campaign and will be a big miss against his former side, Liverpool. Even goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli was Premier League property at one point, with Manchester City buying him from Deportivo Maldonado, although they loaned him to Real Sociedad and he never featured for the English side. Vicente Iborra, meanwhile, spent two seasons with Leicester City, while Pervis Estupinan was a Watford player for four seasons, all of which he spent on loan in Spain at different clubs before Villarreal bought him in 2020. It is Netherlands forward Danjuma, though, who has had the biggest impact, especially with Gerard Moreno troubled by injury problems, and in a hybrid half-winger, half-striker role, has been on fire in recent weeks. He has netted six times in 10 Champions League games, including against Juventus and Bayern, as well as terrorising Manchester United at Old Trafford, even as Villarreal were narrowly beaten. “If we look at what I’ve done this season, it’s quite fair and factual to say I’m among the best wingers in the world,” he told The Guardian in a recent interview. Capable of stretching the pitch and regularly creating his own chances, it is hard to disagree. Villarreal paid €25 million (£21m/$29m) for the winger, so his fine performances have not been totally unexpected, even though he has surpassed expectations, leading to interest from Liverpool in a possible transfer.

The French midfielder, 33, is enjoying an Indian summer in his career, to the point where there is some clamour for him to be included in Didier Deschamps’ squad for the 2022 World Cup. Capoue has not featured for Les Bleus since 2013, having previously won seven international caps, with one goal, against Belarus in 2012. “I’m not on the station platform waiting for it,” Capoue told L’Equipe, surprised by the discussion. “I really don't think about it, I’m fulfilled in my life. If one day, I see my name on the list, it would be a huge surprise.” The defensive midfielder has, however, played 37 times this season, reaching 2,943 minutes, the fifth-most of any player at the club in 2021-22, and is not slowing down. Capoue struggled to make the step up to Tottenham from Toulouse after moving to White Hart Lane in 2013 as one of the seven signings the club made with the money raised following the sale of Gareth Bale. But he did eventually find a home in England at Watford in 2015, where he stayed until the January 2021 transfer window. Villarreal took him from the Championship to European football and Capoue rewarded them with a Man-of-the-Match worthy display in the Europa League final, as they beat Manchester United on penalties. The other former Spurs players have also impressed this season in Foyth, Aurier and Lo Celso, and coach Emery thinks they made the right decision to come to Spain. ""Tottenham is also a very big club, but here they could win things,"" he told The Athletic. ""Tottenham has been years without winning anything, no trophies."" Lo Celso appeared sporadically for Spurs in the first half of the season before Villarreal eagerly brought him into the side on loan in January, and he has fitted like a glove back in La Liga. Emery is keen to bring the 25-year-old in permanently this summer, with Lo Celso having played a key role in the goal that secured Villarreal’s passage to the semi-finals. It was his through ball that Gerard Moreno fed to goalscorer Samu Chukwueze, a key contribution to cap a sparkling performance from the Argentina international. Lo Celso may be used higher up the pitch against Liverpool, with Gerard Moreno unlikely to be fit for the clash on Wednesday night on Merseyside. Foyth has been a regular at right-back, shading out his competition in Aurier. Rulli, meanwhile, has dislodged Sergio Asenjo in goal, while Iborra offers able back up in midfield with Emery rotating around the Champions League games, and Coquelin battled well against Bayern in both legs. Were it not for a troublesome Achilles tendon issue, Coquelin would have featured more this season and Emery was boosted by the former Arsenal midfielder’s return to training on Saturday. He could be a key part of Emery’s plan to combat Liverpool’s midfield, shutting down the glittering Thiago Alcantara. He, and team-mate Parejo, arrived from Valencia when Los Che’s financial troubles meant they sold off some key players for cut-price fees in the summer of 2020. Alone, Villarreal’s scattered Premier League players may have lacked consistency and significant success, but together, they have reached new ground, with Liverpool standing between them and a first Champions League final.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/villarreal-miracle-premier-league-rejects-champions-league/blt51639438f77adfbb,Rik Sharma,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6721,Antony wants Man Utd! Brazilian decides to try late transfer push at Ajax,"Ajax star Antony is pushing to join Manchester United before the close of the summer transfer window, GOAL understands, as he has decided he doesn't want to wait any longer to take the next step in his career.  The Brazilian has missed training sessions and was not part of the squad for the Eredivisie clash against Sparta on Sunday in a sudden escalation of his pressure campaign against his current club. The winger's absence is due to calculated decisions from his entourage as they look to convince the Dutch organisation to let him leave for the Premier League this month. Manchester United have been trying to sign the 22-year-old throughout the summer. However, the Red Devils have so far refused to match Ajax's asking price, which was initially set at €80 million (£68m/$80m) but has since been raised to near €100m (£85m/$100m). The Amsterdam team are playing hard ball in the wake of Manchester United's horrendous start to the season which has left them with zero points from two Premier League matches following defeats against Brighton and Brentford.  Manchester United's desperation to improve their attacking options under new coach Erik ten Hag by bringing in another exciting prospect such as Antony has prompted Ajax to raise their asking price. But Antony is now urging Ajax to strike a deal with the Old Trafford side, making it clear that his wish is to join Manchester United before the end of the transfer period. The Red Devils are considering improving on their previous offer of €70m (£59m/$70m) for the ex-Sao Paulo player and will make a new bid in the near future. Antony, who joined Ajax from Sao Paulo in 2020, recently suggested that he wants to leave the club. The winger is signed to a contract that runs until 2025, but he refused to commit his future to Ajax in an interview with De Telegraaf, saying: “No, to be perfectly honest, I can’t [promise to stay]. Now I am focusing on playing football and have put all other matters in the hands of my agents and my brother. They will advise me on what is best."" The Brazil international has made 82 appearances for Ajax in all competitions, scoring 24 times. He stood out recently with an excellent solo goal as his side ran out 6-1 winners against Groningen last week.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/antony-wants-man-utd-brazilian-decides-to-try-late-transfer-push-/bltcef03f363237244f,Raisa Simplicio & Thiago Fernandes,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

8933,Dawn of new partnership? How Hojlund and Rashford helped each other score,"Manchester United have cruised to a 2-0 lead over Wolverhampton Wanderers at half-time at the Molineux this Thursday. Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund were backed to develop a partnership by Erik ten Hag recently. And finally, against Wolves, the duo came good by scoring goals and also helping each other. Hojlund was unlucky to have a fine effort ruled offside before half-time. He provided the all-important assist to help Rashford score the goal that would silence his critics. Rashford returned the favour by being involved in the build-up to Hojlund's goal that came later. He released the ball at the right time for Luke Shaw to get on it and supply the cross that eventually assisted Hojlund's goal. This is the first time Man United have had a proper attacking partnership up top, with both Hojlund and Rashford looking out for each other.

2553,Ajax most expensive player sales - How Eredivisie giants made over €1.1 billion in outgoing transfers,"Ajax have been one of the most profitable clubs in world football when it comes to their business model. The Dutch giants have continued to fight for silverware despite letting go of their biggest stars in almost every summer transfer window for impressive figures. Having probably one of the best football academies in world football, Ajax have ensured that they earn huge money through player sales as they have a seemingly never-ending supply of wonderkids coming through, especially in the last decade. And as if that wasn't enough, they have also mastered the art of buying external talent on the cheap, only to sell them on at significant profits. Several players like Frenkie de Jong, Matthijs de Ligt, Hakim Ziyech, Donny van de Beek and many more came to Ajax as budding footballers, but left the club as superstars.  And Ajax ensured they earned a huge premium on their investment by selling them to prospective buyers. Just recently, they sold Antony to Manchester United for €95m (£85.5m), thus taking their overall sales to almost €600m (£525m) just since the 2019-20 season.

Compatriot Antonio Rudiger has for a second time urged Kroos to come out of retirement for Germany, and lead them into Euro 2024 in front of a home crowd. Kroos, 34, quit die Mannschaft after Euro 2020 (held in 2021), after another disappointing exit for his side, reaching 106 caps. Rudiger was quoted by Relevo, praising his teammate and making it clear that he could be crucial for his side this summer. âItâs at home, we want to have the best players there, and at this moment I see Toni as one of the best German players, because he is also one of the best Real Madrid players at the moment.â Germany face Scotland, Hungary and Switzerland in the group stages, as they return home for major international tournament 18 years after the 2006 World Cup.

5048,Ten Hag blasts 'unacceptable' Man Utd pre-season letdown as manager continues to demand more from team,"Erik ten Hag has slammed Manchester United for an ""unacceptable"" collapse in their 2-2 draw against Aston Villa on Saturday. The Red Devils went two goals up through Jadon Sancho and an own goal, but Villa fought back to pull level in second-half stoppage time. Manchester United's dip in focus left the new manager infuriated and said that they had no excuses for not clinching the win. The Red Devils are trying to build their winning mentality back up after a disappointing 2021-22 term, and Ten Hag has set high expectations right away. Ten Hag said after the game: ""We had a lot of movement behind the defending line, scored two great goals so we were 2-0 up at half-time and then our focus dropped. ""It can be that the guys are tired but that's not an excuse. They have to perform and it is what we didn't do in the second half. In the first half we were really good. ""It was the focus."" He added: ""I don't want to make excuses about the pitch or weather. No matter what we have to perform. ""Football is a sport of mistakes and we have to decrease the mistakes. That's clear but I have seen a lot of progress in these two weeks. ""In the first half I saw really good football, really controlling and dominating the game but we have to learn from what happened in the second half. It's not possible that you go 2-0 and then throw it away. ""That's what I just said in the dressing room, a drop of focus is unacceptable but to the season I'm happy because now I can tell them it cannot happen. ""We have to get out of the dressing room and back in your plan and your focus and back to your performance and that is what we didn't do."" Ten Hag's men will be in action again next Saturday when they take on Atletico Madrid in another friendly. They will then round off their pre-season tour the following day with a match against Rayo Vallecano. United's Premier League campaign will commence on August 7 with a home game against Brighton with a trip to Brentford to follow on August 13.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ten-hag-blasts-unacceptable-man-utd-pre-season-letdown-as/bltfe54052d268f9568,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2185,Arteta given Arsenal sack warning by Gallas: Get top four or you're in trouble!,"Former Arsenal defender William Gallas has warned Mikel Arteta that he could be sacked if the Gunners do not finish in the top four. Arteta is into his third full season in the hot seat and he has so far failed to secure the Champions League qualification that the club craves.  Last season, the Gunners seemed destined to secure fourth spot, only for a late collapse to see them drop out at the expense of bitter rivals Tottenham.   Arteta has since been backed in the transfer window, with Arsenal bringing in Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Jesus this summer, ramping up the pressure for them to perform this campaign.  In an interview with Genting Casino, Gallas has predicted that Arteta's job will be in jeopardy if Arsenal fail to secure a top-four finish. ""Of course he will be in trouble. Arteta has been asked to make the top four and he didn't do it last season,"" he said. ""If Arsenal don't play in the Champions League next season, it would cause a lot of drama. They have to have a great season, possibly win the Premier League, but definitely to qualify for the Champions League.  ""They have just bought new players, it's in the hands of Arteta and the players. It will be a big problem for all of them if they don't do their job to qualify in the Champions League."" The Gunners last graced Europe's top club competition during the 2016-17 season, having finished third in the Premier League in the previous campaign.  Things began promisingly as they topped Group A ahead of Paris Saint-Germain, Ludogorets and Basel. However, as has happened many times previously, the knockout stages proved to be a bridge too far.  Arsenal were handed a tough last-16 tie against Bayern Munich and ended up being humiliated. A 5-1 defeat at the Allianz Arena in the first leg all but booked Bayern's place in the quarter final, though that did not stop them subjecting the Gunners to a second 5-1 loss in the return game.  Gallas also took time to discuss his compatriot and namesake William Saliba, who impressed on his Arsenal debut against Crystal Palace last Friday.  ""Saliba is a really good player. He had a great season at Marseille, now he's back at Arsenal, it is a big step,"" he added. ""He will show what he can really do. Last season he was upset to leave Arsenal on loan. When I look at him, he reminds me of a player I used to play against, and that player is Rio Ferdinand.  ""If you look at how Saliba plays, and how Rio did when he was young, they have the same style. I didn't say he will have the same career, but I hope he does. He just has a similar style to Ferdinand.  ""I think Saliba will surprise a lot of people, as he plays more games and gains more confidence, because he has pressure on his shoulders, he's still so young and has much to prove, he will be even better.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arteta-arsenal-sack-warning-gallas-top-four/bltffc122ce622d3bb9,Matt O'Connor-Simpson,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

The Ligue 1 champions meet winners of the Coupe de France to contest the first piece of silverware of the new campaign. PSG are playing their first competitive game under new coach Christophe Galtier and will be looking to get off to a strong start in the post-Mauricio Pochettino era.  PSG are the big favourites to get the win in 90 minutes at 4/11 (1.36) with bet365. Nantes are big underdogs to get the victory at 7/1 (8.0) with the draw priced at 4/1 (5.0). PSG stars Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi are the favourites to get the game's first goal at just 3/1 (4.0) while Mauro Icardi is 7/2 (4.5) and Neymar is 9/2 (5.5). Nantes forward Mostafa Mohamed 10/1 (11.0) to break the deadlock, while Evann Guessand is 12/1 (13.0). PSG's new player Nordi Mukiele has travelled to Israel with the rest of the squad and could feature in the first competitive game under Galtier. However, Hugo Ekitike will not be part of the team as he has not made the trip to Tel Aviv. Nantes, meanwhile, could have Moses Simon available after he passed a fitness test to make it on the flight to Israel. Nantes have a good record against PSG and Simon was a big factor in their 3-1 victory over the Parisian club in February. The Nigeria star got one assist and was a constant thorn in the side of the French champions and will be out to spring another surprise with Nantes this time around.

591,"‘Even though she takes a bit of energy, she gives me so much’ – Juventus star Hurtig ‘smiling more’ after becoming a mother","Lina Hurtig takes a long pause and looks around the room while she thinks. She is struggling to come up with an answer to the question put to her, until Juventus’ press officer gives her opinion. “I do?” she asks, responding to the voice off camera. “She says I’m smiling more!” she tells GOAL, turning back towards the computer. There were a lot of big moments for Hurtig in 2021, but none more so than when she became a mother last June. It is that which those around the club can see has her beaming even more so than usual. “Right now, it's not a good time to ask because my daughter is getting her teeth, so we're struggling a bit at home!” the Swedish forward laughs. “But no, of course, that was an unbelievable summer. “She came in June and then I had to leave like four weeks after for the Olympics. That was also a strange situation. Lisa, my wife, she did an amazing job there. She was in Sweden the whole time, so she had a lot of help. Everything went well. ""But it's amazing. Even though she takes a bit of energy sometimes, she also gives me so much. “I said the other day to Lisa, 'I wonder what she will do when she grows up'. I don't know if she wants to play football. I tried to play with her, but she's totally ignoring the ball right now. So, I don't know!” That is not the only exposure she is getting to the sport that both of her parents love - Lisa having played in Sweden’s top flight for six years before giving birth last summer. She is already at Juventus’ games in her own little shirt, with Hurtig on the back, watching her mother play some huge matches at the highest level. As far as Hurtig’s club career goes, the game she will play on Wednesday evening is one of the biggest yet. Juventus will face seven-time European champions Lyon in the Women’s Champions League quarter-finals, at the Juventus Stadium. It is an opponent many in this team know well, having played the French giants in last season’s competition. That time around, Lyon were the defending champions, and Juve were still making a name for themselves. That the Italians only lost 3-2 in the first leg was a result that showed their potential. ""Last time we played them, it was a big test for us,” Hurtig remembers. “This year, we got through the group stage and we are where we want to be, you know? Out in Europe, competing against the best - that's exactly where we want to be and where we should be. ""I think we are coming into this game with a lot more confidence than last time. Of course, it's still a really good team, though. I think we're more prepared this time."" Juve caused a big upset in the group stages to get to this point, too, beating last season's finalists, Chelsea, to qualification. “We gained a lot of confidence [from that],” Hurtig says. “We know we're a good team and that was like proof to show everybody else also that we are here to compete against the best in Europe. ""I think people were not counting on us being out there in Europe. I think a lot of people have opened their eyes and said, 'Wow, Juventus is here to stay'."" This past year, Juve has developed massively. Under the guidance of former Arsenal boss Joe Montemurro, the team has shown its ability to be tactically flexible and defensively resolute, but also expansive going forward. Each individual is better than the last time they played Lyon, too. Hurtig, for example, has since played at an Olympics for the first time and in an Olympic final. Sweden were beaten by Canada on penalties last summer, but it is an experience that certainly helps a player grow. Hurtig’s performances in Japan gave her a lot of confidence going into this new season, while the silver medal she collected added to her hunger for trophies. There was a point in the 26-year-old’s career where some wondered if she would reach this point – competing at the highest level, in the biggest games, on a regular basis. The doubt was never around the talent she possessed, but the bad luck she was being dealt so often through injury. It is a journey that makes her proud when she reflects. “There were a couple of years when I struggled a lot with my foot,” she explains. “I trained, I got injured. I trained, I got injured. There was no flow at all. “What motivates you is that you want to get back to the pitch. I want to play football. That's what I love to do. That's my job and it's the only thing I know how to do! “It also makes me wonder sometimes if I didn't have that many injuries, where would I be? “There was a couple of years I, like, lost. If I look back at it now, I would say I lost a couple of years there, but it got better and now I'm here and only looking forward.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/juventus-star-hurtig-smiling-more-after-becoming-mother/blt72d10b10e7426a7b,Ameé Ruszkai,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5513,Paul Wanner: Bayern Munich's record-breaking wonderkid earning Ozil comparisons,"Desperate times call for desperate measures, and when Bayern Munich were hit by a Covid-19 outbreak just days before the resumption of the Bundesliga season following the winter break, emergency plans needed to be drawn up. A number of the club's talented academy stars were promoted to the first-team squad, but that was not enough to fill out the bench sufficiently for the trip to Borussia Monchengladbach. So, with resources close to home exhausted, Bayern made a call to the German Football Association (DFB) to request that midfield duo Paul Wanner and Arijon Ibrahimovic be put on the first plane home from Marbella, where they were part of a Germany Under-17s training camp. The two 16-year-olds were duly rushed back from Spain, but given the short notice and their lack of experience of even reserve-team football, it was felt unlikely that either would feature for Julian Nagelsmann's side. For Ibrahimovic that was the case, as he remained on the bench throughout the 90 minutes at Borussia-Park. But for Wanner, the bad luck suffered by those who tested positive for coronavirus provided him with the opportunity to not just make history, but also change the trajectory of his career forever. Wanner's 15-minute cameo off the bench saw him become the youngest player in Bayern Munich history at the age of 16 years and 15 days, and the second-youngest Bundesliga debutant behind only Borussia Dortmund striker Youssoufa Moukoko. For many players of his age, that would have been the last fans saw of him for a couple of years, returned to the youth ranks to further develop his game. But Nagelsmann has been mightily impressed by the attacking midfielder, and insisted he remain part of the senior squad, with Wanner now having made two further substitute appearances in Bayern's subsequent matches. For those who saw Wanner in action on his debut, that should not come as a surprise. From the moment he entered the pitch he looked assured, with his first action in the game seeing him control a pass from Benjamin Pavard on the right-hand side before setting off on a dribble that left two far more seasoned defenders in his wake. The teenager regularly demanded possession from his team-mates as they looked for a way to rescue a point after falling 2-1 behind, and it was he who started the move that almost led to a late equaliser from Robert Lewandowski. ""He can do everything... He's an incredible talent,"" was Nagelsmann's assessment in his post-match press conference of a player who is already being likened to Mesut Ozil due to his playmaking abilities. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: ""He has a very tight and dynamic ball control, with which he can completely change game situations,"" Germany U17s manager, Marc-Patrick Meister, tells GOAL and SPOX of Wanner, whose forward-thinking approach is what stands him out from the crowd among creative midfielders. A superb passer and dribbler for his age, Wanner's first thought is always to keep the ball moving towards the opposition's goal, with his speed of thought and execution marking him out as a special talent. For Germany's U17s he averages a goal or assist every 77.6 minutes from his seven caps, while he also has four direct goal contributions to his name for Bayern's U19s this season. ""Paul is a very agile attacking player who has already played in all attacking midfield positions,"" Meister explains, with that likely to help Wanner further integrate himself into the Bayern team in the coming years. His natural position is as a No.10, but with Thomas Muller showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon, opportunities to play that role are likely to be limited for Wanner. As such, the experience he has picked up from playing out wide means that he can be a versatile option for Nagelsmann, even if breaking into one of the best teams in world football is quite the challenge for a player so young. ""He's incredibly ambitious. The harder the challenge, the better his performances - he's really someone who grows with his tasks,"" Bayern Munich academy coach Alex Moj told The Athletic in a recent interview, and Meister agrees, saying that Wanner's ""will to learn"" will help him continue to improve. One area of Wanner's game that has been developed since he arrived at Bayern from FV Ravensburg in 2018 is his defensive ability, and his willingness to work hard to win back possession via counter-pressing. Though he is not physically imposing as yet, Wanner has worked hard to make himself a handful for opponents both with and without the ball, and Meister is backing him to make the changes needed to thrive in the men's game. ""Players of his age are confronted with things in a very short time that others have more time to understand and adapt to,"" he says. ""The pace of the game, for example, is much faster and the time for a decision on the ball is much shorter. ""If he [Wanner] stays healthy, he can adapt and achieve a lot with the skills he has."" The son of former footballer, Klaus, who played the majority of his career in Austria, Wanner certainly has a good advisor in his corner, while he shares an agent with fellow Bayern teenager Jamal Musiala. His representatives are, GOAL and SPOX can confirm, working on a new contract for their client, as Wanner's current deal is set to run out at the end of the 2021-22 season, with clubs from around Germany and elsewhere in Europe having begun queuing up to talk to the youngster should an agreement on fresh terms not be reached. The issue that needs most ironing out is the plan for Wanner going forward, and whether a loan would make sense in the near future to ensure he earns more experience of the senior game should opportunities at Bayern dry up in the coming months. Either way, Wanner looks primed for a long and successful career towards the top of the German game. Necessity is, after all, the mother of invention, and in Bayern's case, their desperation to fill out their virus-ridden squad may well have helped them unearth a real gem.

4136,"'After those penalties, we were Black' - Bellingham makes powerful statement on racism in English football","Jude Bellingham says it felt like many fans in England turned against the national team's Black players in the wake their Euro 2020 final defeat to Italy on penalties last summer. After Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka failed to convert their shootout attempts, they were subjected to racist abuse on social media. Bellingham believes they were singled out as Black only when they did something wrong on the pitch - a form of discrimination he says ""should never happen"". “You look at the run into that final and you felt as though the country had united,” Bellingham told reporters on Tuesday. “Then as soon as they missed a penalty, they were not English, just black.  ""Anyone can miss a penalty. Anyone can make a mistake in their line of work. But to be criticised like that should never happen. They are human."" Bellingham praised England boss Gareth Southgate for his public and private support of the team's Black players. “To be fair, Gareth Southgate was brilliant,” he said. “He has always brought it up as a topic in meetings when we are aware that we going to [a country with a history of racism]. We went to Hungary shortly after the Euros and the same thing happened again but we felt more prepared. We felt more supported because of what Gareth had put in place. As a Black player you feel very grateful for that.” “There’s not a single job in the world where you deserve to be criticised with racism. I’ll never forget the first time I properly got a batch of messages. My club were quick to send someone to message me and make sure I was alright and I really appreciate that. I had team-mates message me and family members."" While the Borussia Dortmund midfielder was happy with the treatment he received from Southgate, he was less pleased with how instances of racism have been handled by football's governing body in Germany. Bellingham compared the quick punishment he received for suggesting match-fixing in the Bundesliga to what he believed to be a lack of action towards abuse. “I didn’t receive anything from the DFB or FA,"" he said. ""And I always kind of compare it to when I said the thing about the referee in December. They were very quick to get into contact to give me my fine, give me my punishment and kind of make it a big drama in the media. “I’ve learned from that. I know what I can and can’t say. I know that sometimes I have to control my emotions better. But, you know, when you give that more energy than the situation I was going through, well - I felt: ‘Maybe we are alone. Maybe they’re not interested, maybe they don’t care. And maybe it is down to me and down to us to work independently to get our message out.’”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/after-those-penalties-we-were-black-bellingham-makes/bltae3bd8e4bda7de63,Dan Bernstein,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4041,Chelsea turn down Crystal Palace's request to allow Gallagher to play in the FA Cup semi-final,"Chelsea have denied Crystal Palace's request to allow Conor Gallagher special dispensation to face his parent club in the FA Cup semi-final. Even though the loan contract forbids them from using the England international against the Blues, changes could have been made to allow it. The 22-year-old was not involved in the talks and didn't appeal to his parent club to play. Patrick Vieira's side are on a fantastic run of form, winning four of their last five matches. Indeed, Gallagher has been a huge part of that run and has played in 31 matches, including all four of his side's FA Cup matches thus far. Furthermore, he has been decisive in the final third, racking up eight goals and five assists in all competitions. Gareth Southgate has noticed his excellent form on loan and called up Gallagher during the last two international breaks, allowing him to play three times for the England men's national team.  Derby County successfully convinced Chelsea to allow them special dispensation to use loanees Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori against the Stamford Bridge club in the past.  However, it was a Championship club which was managed by Frank Lampard asking them in a fourth round Carabao Cup match.  The stakes will be much higher for the Blues on Sunday. Thomas Tuchel is understood to be a huge admirer of Gallagher and tried to keep him with the squad over the summer. The west Londoners subsequently allowed the homegrown star to go on loan because the player believed he would get more minutes at Palace. The Blues are now strongly considering keeping him with the squad next season and giving him a prominent role.  Clubs, including Palace, have inquired about signing him on a permanent deal.  However, the Blues were quoting at least £50 million ($65m) needed to start a conversation over a transfer, pricing many potential suitors out of a move. His current contract at Stamford Bridge runs until June 2025.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-turn-down-crystal-palace-s-request-to-allow-gallagher-to-/blte4c43b370a23080a,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4432,"Tomori convinced former Chelsea team mate Abraham to move to Roma: 'Bro, this is a good league'","AC Milan defender Fikayo Tomori says he urged ex-Chelsea team-mate Tammy Abraham to join Roma last summer. The striker has thrived in Serie A since swapping London for the Italian capital last summer, scoring 23 goals in 40 appearances. He followed Tomori's path by moving to Italy as the centre-back had joined Milan on loan in January 2021 before making the move permanent in the summer. Tomori says he had a hand in the 24-year-old's decision to move abroad, telling The Guardian: “When he said Roma was on the table, I said: ‘Bro this is a good league’.  “I felt like it would develop his game a lot. He has scored a lot of goals this season for Roma, they’re fighting for a Champions League spot.  ""Definitely it’s helped him and definitely I gave him rave reviews about Serie A because I enjoyed myself so much the first six months.” Since his arrival in Italy, Tomori has noticed some big differences between football in Serie A and the way the game is played in the Premier League. “In England, it’s more like basketball. Everything’s end-to-end, there’s more intensity, a lot more happens reactively,"" he said.  ""In Italy it’s more like American football. It’s like you have ‘plays’. When the ball’s here, I need to be here. When the ball goes, I know I have to be two metres over in that direction, or be looking for this particular player. “In England it’s very much off the cuff and things happen so fast. You can be attacking one minute and the next the ball’s flipped over your head and you’ve got to run back 30 yards, then you’re back on the attack.  ""Here it’s more like: ‘OK, the ball’s there, where’s my teammate? Where’s the opposition?’ If the ball goes over the top I need to be in a position where I can leave the striker and get there, but if the ball goes into feet I’m in a position to go press.” Despite his strong performances, Tomori has not been given much playing time for England. The defender has just two caps to his name, making his debut in 2019 and then playing 30 minutes against Andorra last October, and he has been left out of the current team. He acknowledges that there are a lot of big names ahead of him, but hopes to make the cut for the 2022 World Cup after missing out on a place in the Euro 2020 squad. ""There’s just so many talented players in my position already – [Harry] Maguire, [John] Stones, [Conor] Coady, [Tyrone] Mings, [Ben] White at Arsenal – and there’s a limited amount of positions,"" he added. “I just have to make sure I’m playing at a high level. And then when I do get called on, to make sure I’m ready. I have to focus on what I’m doing here at Milan first and foremost.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tomori-chelsea-abraham-roma-bro-this-is-a-good-league/blt20b48db301b2e2b6,By Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2572,"Orlando Pirates vs AmaZulu Preview: Kick-off time, TV channel, squad news","Orlando Pirates and AmaZulu renew their rivalry when they clash in Sunday’s Nedbank Cup Round of 32 match at Orlando Stadium. For Usuthu coach Benni McCarthy and a few of his players, it would be a return to a stadium they once called home. Sunday’s game comes after just over a month of a break both teams enjoyed preparing for the rest of the season. Interestingly, Pirates and AmaZulu met each other in the last match before going on the break on December 23. Their meeting was at Orlando Stadium, a venue they return to meet at on Sunday. Pirates will be without midfielder Vincent Pule who is still injured. Since early October, the 29-year-old has been battling fitness issues and is yet to recover. The Buccaneers are also concerned about star attacker Thembinkosi Lorch who injured himself in last weekend’s DStv Compact Cup. Zakhele Lepasa is said not to be fully fit despite coming back in their last match against AmaZulu after spending over a year on the sidelines. Goalkeeper Richard Ofori has also not gained full fitness and Siyabonga Mpotshane is set to continue as the number one goal-minder. AmaZulu coach Benni McCarthy would be looking to put the drama behind him that characterised transfer rumours over his midfielder Siyethembe Sithebe. Sithebe was wanted by Kaizer Chiefs but Usuthu did not accept an exchange of two players for their most prized asset. New signings Abbubaker Mobara and South Sudan forward Abraham Majok could make their debut for Usuthu. Pirates are in the hunt for their first Nedbank Cup title since the 2013/14 season while AmaZulu have never won this competition before.  Usuthu have been runners-up six times and this time around they would be pushing to claim the Nedbank Cup.  Behind Kaizer Chiefs’ 13 titles for this premier knockout competition in South African football, Pirates have claimed it on eight occasions, making them the second most successful team in this tournament. Winning the Nedbank Cup is an automatic ticket to next season’s Caf Confederation Cup, so Pirates and AmaZulu would be giving their best shot in case they don't finish in favourable positions in the Premier Soccer League race.  When Pirates and AmaZulu last met, the Buccaneers won 2-1 and the reverse fixture earlier on in the season ended 1-1 in Durban.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/orlando-pirates-vs-amazulu-preview-kick-off-time-tv-channel/blt6cf7b9651d011a3f,Michael Madyira,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10227,Sunderland vs Newcastle Prediction: FA Cup Third Round Preview,"This weekend, the Stadium of Light will host the first derby between Sunderland and Newcastle United since the sides last met in the Premier League back in 2016. We look ahead to their FA Cup third-round clash with our Sunderland vs Newcastle prediction and preview. FA Cup third-round ties don’t come much bigger than this. This Saturday, the Stadium of Light will play host to the first Tyne–Wear derby (or Wear-Tyne, depending on where you’re from) in almost eight years as Sunderland face Newcastle. It’s the first meeting between these two giant north-east clubs since playing out a 1-1 draw at St James’ Park in the Premier League back in 2016.  It’s fair to say a lot has changed since then.  The Magpies were relegated at the end of that 2015-16 season for just the second time in their Premier League history but managed to come straight up under Rafael Benítez, winning the Championship the following season. They’ve remained in the top-flight ever since, and the Saudi Arabia PIF’s takeover of the club has supercharged their ascent towards the top of English game. While Newcastle were busy winning the Championship in 2016-17, Sunderland toiled in the Premier League and finished rock bottom. They’ve not been back since, and even played four seasons in League One between 2018 and 2022.  Things are looking up for the Black Cats though. After a sixth-placed finish in the Championship last season and subsequent elimination in the play-off semi-finals, they are once again in the promotion hunt. Sunderland currently sit in sixth place and come into this fixture unbeaten in their last three matches. They kicked off 2024 in perfect style with a 2-0 home win against Preston North End. Jack Clarke has been fundamental to their successful campaign to date. The left winger has scored 12 league goals (the next highest Sunderland players have four), a tally only three Championship players can better. Clarke also leads all Sunderland players for overall expected goals (8.8), expected assists (6.1), chances created (59) and successful dribbles per 90 (3.7). If he takes his fine league form into this FA Cup game then new manager Michael Beale can feel confident about his side getting a result against their rivals, who are enduring a difficult campaign. Newcastle come into this fixture amid a horrible run. Eddie Howe’s side have won just one of their last eight games in all competitions, and travel to Sunderland on the back of three consecutive defeats in the Premier League. With a mounting injury list, Howe will want to get to the winter break as soon as possible, but having exited the UEFA Champions League and Carabao Cup while also sitting ninth in the Premier League, it places extra emphasis on the importance of a deep FA Cup run. It could well be their only route back into Europe next season. Reports from the Newcastle camp are that Joe Willock, Harvey Barnes and Elliot Anderson will join Callum Wilson in missing this fixture, as well as the next Premier League game against Manchester City. Kieran Trippier has a chance to play a part after missing the Liverpool game with a groin problem, while Jamaal Lascelles is also fit again and could start after his short appearance at Anfield. The likes of Jacob Murphy, Nick Pope, Matt Targett and Javier Manquillo remain sidelined. Sunderland suffered a handful of fresh injuries over the busy festive period with Niall Huggins sustaining a season-ending knee injury, while Bradley Dack and Patrick Roberts also limped out of recent games and are unlikely to feature here.  Newcastle are winless in their last nine meetings with Sunderland in all competitions (D3 L6, all in the Premier League between 2012 and 2016) since a 1-0 away win in August 2011. It’s their longest ever winless run against their north-east rivals. Sunderland have won their last three home games against Newcastle, and five out of the last six meetings at either ground. They’ve never won four in a row against Newcastle at home.  In the FA Cup, Sunderland have won their last two ties against Newcastle, although this is the first such meeting since a 2-0 quarter-final win in 1955-56. Although they’ve enjoyed good runs in the EFL Cup in the last two campaigns – getting to the final in 2022-23 and the quarter-final this season – Newcastle have not had similar success in the FA Cup. The Magpies have lost their last four FA Cup matches, while they’ve gone out at the third round stage in each of the last three seasons. In their most recent two campaigns, they’ve been eliminated by opponents from a lower division (Sheffield Wednesday in 2022-23 and Cambridge United in 2021-22). That will give Sunderland hope of springing an upset, although the Black Cats have been eliminated from their last four FA Cup ties against Premier League opponents. In fact, when playing in a lower division, they haven’t beaten a Premier League side in the competition since January 2005 (2-1 vs. Crystal Palace). The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off in this match, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Despite their excellent head-to-head record over their bitter rivals, the Opta supercomputer only gives Sunderland an 18.3% chance of beating Newcastle this weekend. The visitors make the short journey to the Stadium of Light with a depleted squad, but the supercomputer believes they still have the quality to progress, with Newcastle winning 61.6% of the 10,000 data-powered simulations of this tie. The draw comes in at 20.1%. Enjoy this? Subscribe to our new football newsletter to receive exclusive weekly content.

5420,Chukwueze's goal not enough to help Villarreal against Alaves in La Liga,"Nigeria international Samuel Chukwueze was on target but Villarreal lost 2-1 away to Alaves in a La Liga game staged at Mendizorroza in Vitoria-Gasteiz on Saturday. The winger has been in good form for the Yellow Submarine in the last couple of games, and it explains why coach Unai Emery started him on the right flank. It was the hosts who settled quickly and needed just four minutes to get the ball in the back of the net.  Luis Rioja's good cross into the danger zone was intercepted by the defenders and it went out for a corner. From the set piece, Joselu managed to flick the ball with his head to the unmarked Victor Laguardia, who maximised the chance to hand his team the lead. The first meaningful contribution for Chukwueze was after 15 minutes when he received the ball in the 18-yard area, but his one-time effort was way off target. In the 30th minute, he once again missed a chance to make when he took too long to make a decision in the danger zone, and the opposing defender successfully stole the ball from him. It happened to be a costly miss as Alaves doubled their advantage a minute later. Ruben Duarte found Gonzalo Escalante in the area and the latter cut in beautifully before rifling the ball past the goalkeeper. Chukwueze, finally, managed to score in the 47th minute. He controlled a Giovani Lo Celso pass well before advancing into the danger zone and unleashing a powerful shot past Fernando Pacheco in the Alaves goal. The goal set up a tense finale but the hosts held on to bag maximum points. The loss is arguably a confidence blow for Villarreal who will host Liverpool on Tuesday in the second leg of the Uefa Champions League semi-finals. The Spanish outfit fell 2-0 in the first leg staged at the Anfield on Wednesday.

Racking up 33 goals in 46 appearances for the club, the Polish striker delivered a stellar debut campaign.This season, however, things are not that bright for the 35-year-old, whose form has seemingly dropped lately. With a new young striker arriving from Brazil and multiple links to Saudi Arabia emerging, the Catalans were rumored to try and offload Lewy in the summer.But according to a recent report from Diario Sport, the club have a different plan in mind. Rather than pushing the veteran striker, whose contract at Camp Nou expires in 2025, out, Barca are ready to allow Lewandowski to decide his own future.Of course, offloading the second-highest earner would ease the club's ongoing financial struggles, but retaining such a seasoned player for another year would likely ensure 15-20 goals for Barca, which is not a bad option either.Ferran breathing down Lewandowski's neck: Barca's top five scorers this season",https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-23-barcas-summer-plan-for-robert-lewandowski-revealed/,Nаdine,2024-01-23T17:53:00.000Z,Diario Sport
610,Klopp wants points if Man Utd protest forces postponement of Liverpool's trip to Old Trafford,"Jurgen Klopp believes Liverpool should be given the points should their clash against Manchester United at Old Trafford be postponed by protests from fans. According to social media activity, fans of the Red Devils are planning fresh protests against the ongoing Glazer ownership of the club, which has recently been thrown into doubt after British Billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe announced that he plans on bidding for the club. The fixture on August 22 is set be the stage for a mass walkout by fans as they try and capitalise on developments in recent days. In May 2021, fans stormed the stadium, gaining access to the Old Trafford pitch and attempted to enter the changing rooms in protest of the Glazer's role in the formation of the failed European Super League. Liverpool eventually won the fixture 4-2, helping them secure Champions League football the following season. Speaking in a press-conference, Klopp said: ""I really hope it will not happen, but if it happens, I think we should get the points. ""We have nothing to do with the situation. If that happens and the supporters want the game to be not happening then we can't just rearrange the game then fit it in somewhere in anyway in an incredibly busy schedule.  ""I don't think and I really hope this will not happen. I have no idea what could happen, I don't think about it. People tell us we are fine so we go there and play the game, hopefully, and go home.

A proper question would be, can Ferran ever become a world-class forward? Good examples of world class forwards include players like Kylian Mbappe, Harry Kane, Vinicius Jr and Lautaro Martinez. Barca were hoping they got one when they paid €55m to get Ferran from Manchester City for the 23-year-old. That hasn't been the case. After two full years, the Blaugrana have only gotten 21 goals for the money they spent on the Spaniard. Even if you add the 12 assists he's registered so far, it's still a far cry from what you'll expect from an expensive forward after 98 games. Let's discuss what Ferran could change to sit on the table of Europe's elite forwards. FinishingFerran can do so much better with his shot accuracy and finishing. In many instances when he gets into excellent positions his finishing ability often lets him down. The Spaniard can hardly be faulted for his work rate as he often puts in the effort any coach would require, but he just doesn't bury it when everyone thinks he would. It's probably why Ferran is not expected to score so many goals even when he plays well. Stats show he's behind Every Barca forward but Lamine in terms of expected goals (xG). Even Gundugan who's a midfielder is expected to score more. PositioningFerran's positioning on the pitch often raises several questions. He drifts inside the striker's position when he doesn't need to and seldom provides the overload Barca desperately needs when he plays either on the left or right. Some don't believe he's better as a number 9 and I agree. The numbers don't lie just 2 goals in his career when playing centre-forward. In one episode during Barca's win against Osasuna in the Super Cup semi-final, Ferran's positioning was called out by an analyst who wondered why he doesn't move into the channels to provide an outlet for Barca like he was asked to do. Ferran drifts into the ST position. He should be widePerhaps Xavi could coach this blatant flaw by shouting at him from the sidelines. If Ferran improves his positing his goal contributions will improve massively. Even if he doesn't get to score, his assists stat would be better off, say even more than Raphinha who has seven assists despite struggling so much with injuries. Over to you, what do you think Ferran needs to improve on? 5 players at Barca whose performances could get Xavi sacked",https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2024-01-18-what-can-ferran-torres-improve-on-to-become-world-class/,Kingsley_,2024-01-18T13:45:00.000Z,Tribuna.com
786,Chilwell says Chelsea 'won't get a better manager' than Tuchel & makes bizarre claim his ACL injury 'came at the perfect time',"Ben Chilwell considers Thomas Tuchel to form part of the global coaching elite and admits that Chelsea are “not going to get a better manager” than a German tactician that has already guided them to Champions League glory. The Blues moved to snap up a proven performer after parting with club legend Frank Lampard in January 2021, with a former Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain boss drafted into their dugout. A memorable European triumph was savoured within a matter of months, while success has also been enjoyed domestically when securing top-four finishes in the Premier League and reaching back-to-back FA Cup finals. Chilwell has no doubts that west London heavyweights have acquired the perfect candidate to lead them forward, as he said ahead of the start of their pre-season tour of America: “As players we have full confidence in the manager. “We know we’re not going to get a better manager here. I’m not just saying it. “Now there is that stability. Everything that could have potentially been tricky last season has been resolved so it is up to us to work and to try to get that consistency on the pitch.” A 25-year-old left-back is eager to play a leading role in Chelsea’s future, having recovered from a serious knee injury last season to make a return to action in a final day victory over Watford. Chilwell was first laid low at the end of November, before suffering a setback in training on Christmas Day, and missed six months of competition. He is now raring to go once more and is looking to take positives from an enforced spell on the sidelines, saying: “As weird as it sounds, the injury happened at the perfect time, I'm back now and we are four or five months away from the World Cup. “If I play well between now and then I'm confident I will be in the squad. It was never a worry I wasn't going to be in World Cup squad, you have to be positive. “I was fortunate. Four and a half months after surgery, I felt no pain. I never really had any bumps in the road. “In terms of an injury like that, it was as plain-sailing as it could be. Every step I kept progressing, and I was fine. I was getting frustrated and I felt like I could have gone quicker, but that would have been stupid.” Chilwell, who has his England legacy number ‘1235’ tattooed on his leg, added on pushing for a place in Gareth Southgate’s plans for Qatar 2022: “It would be the highlight not just of my career, but of my life. “Over the next three or four months I am just going to do everything that I can to try to make sure that is my spot.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chilwell-chelsea-better-manager-tuchel-acl-injury-perfect/bltbc989c610c209ad2,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1,Explained: How Chelsea are affected by Abramovich sanctions,"Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the United Kingdom Government, which will freeze his overseas assets, including Chelsea Football Club. On March 10, it was announced that Chelsea owner Abramovich, alongside six other high net-worth Russians, would be issued with an asset freeze and travel ban. Chelsea are now in an unprecedented period of uncertainty as the running of the club becomes directly linked to geopolitics.  Chelsea can still be sold provided the sale does not benefit Abramovich or the Russian Federation, and the club are in discussions with the government about next steps.  A statement from the UK government reads: ""While the current licence does not permit the sale of the club at this time, the Government is open to a sale of the club and would consider an application for a new licence to allow for a sale. ""Proceeds from any sale could not go to the sanctioned individual while he is subject to sanctions."" At least 20 buyers had been previously ready to purchase Chelsea. Chelsea can continue to play matches under a special 'Russia Regulations' licence which also allows their 1,400 staff - including players - to be paid. The upcoming Thursday evening kick-off against Norwich in the Premier League will go ahead, but only season ticket holders will be allowed to attend home games with further ticket sales barred. The Blues are not allowed to sign any new players due to the terms of their licence. It effectively places another transfer ban on the European and world champions, with the club having already endured one just three years ago. Although Chelsea are banned from making transfers, they can move money in and out of other clubs for outstanding payments related to deals done before the sanctions were imposed on March 10.  Read more about how it will affect Chelsea's transfer plans Chelsea cannot continue their efforts to renew the contracts of their players, with expiring deals like Antonio Rudiger, Cesar Azpilicueta and Andreas Christensen having been previously high on their agenda. Their deals run out in the summer, as do the contracts of several talented youth players, including Xavier Simons. It could force the club to hold onto all players currently under contract, due to their inability to bring players in, should the issue not be resolved in the near future. Chelsea's main shirt sponsor, 3, is known to be reviewing its deal with Chelsea.  “Sanctions placed on Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich by the UK Government casts a shadow over Chelsea’s many commercial agreements, including its $52.5 million (£40m) front-of-shirt deal with Telecom’s brand 3, and its $72m (£55m) kit deal with Nike,” says Conrad Wiacek, Head of Sport Analysis at GloblalData, a leading data and analytics company.  “While Chelsea has a sporting licence to continue trading as a soccer club, many brands will be wary of guilt by association.  “Chelsea FC is still one of the biggest clubs in the world and its on-field success still makes it an attractive commercial partner. However, given the rate at which many brands are looking to dissociate themselves from the Russian state, some may be wary of continuing partnerships.  “Nike’s deal with Chelsea runs until 2032, so the apparel brand may decide to wait the situation out until the club’s sale is able to continue. However, brands such as Hyundai and Hublot, which have deals worth over $20m (£15m) combined expiring at the end of 2021-22 season, may not have that luxury.” Chelsea will be allowed to spend some money on staging matches at Stamford Bridge and in travelling to away matches. A spending limit of just £20,000, however, applies to travel to away games, and could cause issues with preparations for Champions League fixtures in particular. The club will also  have to prove that such costs are 'reasonable costs'. Chelsea are also barred from receiving any revenue from merchandising sales, but will be allowed to take revenue from broadcasting matches. Abramovich is said to be worth £9 billion ($12bn) and valued Chelsea at £3bn ($4bn) during his negotiations to sell the club.  It is currently unclear if or when the sanctions will be lifted. It relates directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin's activity and the invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions will be reviewed in May, but there are further risks of a nine-point deduction should Chelsea go into administration.  In the statement released by the UK Government, it describes Abramovich as a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch who has been involved in destabilising Ukraine."" He is further described as having a ""close relationship with Putin"" and providing steel for tanks in Russia's offensive. Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated in his government's release: ""There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin’s vicious assault on Ukraine. ""Today’s sanctions are the latest step in the UK’s unwavering support for the Ukrainian people. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/explained-how-chelsea-affected-abramovich-sanctions/bltde22a5b972876413,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7361,Keita injury fears mount for Liverpool as Klopp gives update on midfielder after Man Utd defeat,"WHAT HAPPENED? While Keita’s absence from the teamsheet at Old Trafford was viewed as suspicious in some quarters, given recent speculation surrounding the 27-year-old’s future at Anfield, GOAL understands the injury is a genuine one, and that there is concern around the severity. WHAT THEY SAID: Speaking in his post-match press conference after the defeat to United, Klopp said of Keita's muscle issue: “Yesterday he was injured. It needs further assessment, but it doesn’t look like he will be in training tomorrow.  “We need more assessment. He missed yesterday, today, and how much more, I don’t know.” THE BIGGER PICTURE: Any injury at the moment is ill-timed, with Klopp already dealing with something of a crisis in that regard. He hopes to have Diogo Jota and Curtis Jones in training before the end of the month, but Thiago Alcantara, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ibrahima Konate, Joel Matip and new signing Calvin Ramsay are all sidelined, while Darwin Nunez is suspended for the next two games. THE STORY IN ONE PICTURE:  If ever a picture summed up Keita's Liverpool career...  WHAT NEXT FOR LIVERPOOL? Liverpool take on Bournemouth at Anfield on Saturday afternoon before hosting Newcastle next Wednesday. After that comes the Merseyside derby with Everton at Goodison Park on September 3, followed by the first Champions League group stage fixture and then a home clash with Wolves on September 10.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/keita-injury-fears-mount-for-liverpool-as-klopp-gives-update/blt0fe621d99af268c9,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11452,Tiger Kings: Hull City’s Unpredictability an Advantage in 2022-23,"Of the 72 clubs in the English Football League, Hull City are one of the hardest to predict for 2022-23. For most, there’s a range in the table a team is likeliest to inhabit this season, even if we can never tell for sure. The Tigers, though, really could finish anywhere after starting their season with an opening day 2-1 win over Bristol City. There’s a world in which the fresh investment provided by Acun Illicali, and the audacious, exotic recruitment policy, allows City to bring in players who are well above this level ability wise and they win the league. There’s another world in which the 10 new players, including five from abroad, take time to settle, Keane Lewis-Potter is sorely missed, it’s a case of too much, too soon and Hull find themselves embroiled in a relegation scrap. The Tigers have a top-10 budget, though, so the expectation is significant improvement from last season’s 19th-place finish. It’s been eventful. Hull lost George Honeyman to Millwall, who also have eyes on the play-offs this season, which was a divisive topic among supporters. They also lost fellow creative star Lewis-Potter to Brentford, but as that move was considered as progressive for the player, there has been a more positive view from Hull fans. However, City have been able to recruit international experience, with Illicali stating his desire for Premier League football within three years. Most goalkeepers peak at 30, which is a scary thought in terms of Nathan Baxter’s potential. The 22-year-old was talked about as being a contender for Chelsea’s back-up first-team stopper this term, but has instead returned on loan to the KCOM, talking in glowing terms about the project ahead. Baxter has some competition in the form of Matt Ingram, solid himself at this level, but will expect to start given his output last season. Since 2021-22, Baxter is within the top 10 goalkeepers for goals prevented in the Championship (4.1), with 17 goals conceded (excluding own goals) from shots on target totalling 21.1 expected goals on target (xGOT) based on Opta’s model. With Lewis-Potter departing, Jacob Greaves is the one remaining poster boy for the success of Hull City’s academy. As much as Tigers fans have embraced Turkey and welcome the international recruitment policy, there’s something to be said for having the club’s own identity stamped onto the pitch as well, in the name of homegrown talent. Greaves fits the bill. Not only has he come through the youth system, but he is also the son of Mark Greaves, a City legend from the late 1990s and early 2000s. Mark, himself, was a centre-back, very much of the no-nonsense variety. Jacob has inherited elements of his father’s love for defending – he’ll throw himself in front of shots. Operating on the left of a back-three, Greaves loves to drive forward with the ball and get attacks going but when that’s not on, he can also play a beautiful diagonal to the flank. Not only is a Greaves a fantastic defender with enormous potential, but he’s also a shining beacon for what City’s academy can produce. He has that connection with supporters. He gives the club that sense of identity. Lack of experience at the back was a minor problem for Hull last season, rather than a major one. Hull’s defence was reasonably strong last year: the Tigers conceded just 54 goals – the 10th fewest in the Championship and one fewer than play-off side Luton Town – although their 1.39 Expected Goals Against (xGA) per game ranked them 19th in the Championship in 2021-22. The Tigers had four talented defenders vying for three spots and generally, it was Di’Shon Bernard and Alfie Jones competing to start to the right of Sean McLoughlin and Greaves. Each are accomplished ‘ball-players’ who also did the basics of defending, and the numbers support the notion that City didn’t need much in the way of experience. Hull did, though, lose by one or two goals 21 times, and the fact they found themselves on the wrong side of fine margins in 46% of their encounters would suggest a little extra knowhow at key moments wouldn’t hurt. Tobias Figueiredo fits the bill. The 28-year-old centre-back was part of the Nottingham Forest side that won promotion last season. On the opening matchday of the Championship season, Figueiredo gave Hull fans a taste of what to expect, with his surging runs with the ball out from the defence. On his debut against Bristol City, the Portuguese tallied 26 progressive ball carries and a total progressive ball carry distance of 269m – the former the most of any player on the opening weekend and the latter the third highest.   It was a solid debut with Figuieredo clearly unafraid to get in combat when required. Even in such a busy summer, Hull have not strengthened at right wing-back, which suggests two things. Firstly, that the club have a lot of faith in Josh Emmanuel overcoming recent injury woes. After starring in 2020-21 League One title-winning campaign, the former Ipswich academy graduate was hit by injury and hasn’t since played competitive football. When fit, Emmanuel is a dynamic, modern wing-back more than capable at this level, but it’ll be a big ask for him to rediscover top form straight away. Secondly, that there is belief in Lewie Coyle. Initially, the ex-Fleetwood stalwart was believed to be better as a right-back than as a wing-back but finished the season well in the latter position and is hoping to kick-on in 2022-23. Hull’s midfield looks very different this season. In 2021-22, the Tigers were reliant on both Lewis-Potter and Honeyman for creativity – both players created twice as many chances overall as any other team-mate – while the likes of Jean Michaël Seri and Ozan Tufan have come in. Seri was one of the Championship’s top performers last season with his assurance and passing range: the intricate Ivorian’s arrival represents a huge coup for Hull. Although not known for his goals, he scored the winner late on against Bristol City with a deflected long-range effort – already equalling his tally in 34 competitive games for Fulham last season. Tufan, meanwhile, brings with him less than complimentary reviews from Watford supporters based on his four starts in 2021-22, with the 27-year-old struggling with the tempo and intensity of the Premier League. If the Turk – who also scored last weekend against Bristol City on his competitive club debut – has worked on his fitness over the summer, however, then there is that chance for him to show why he’s been capped 65 times and scored nine goals for his country, as well as playing in the Champions League and Europa League with Fenerbahçe. With a touch more technical quality coming into the midfield, there may be more opportunities for Arveladze to implement the style he was brought in for, even if it wasn’t in evidence in the second half of last season. Arveladze favours a 3-4-3 (or 3-4-2-1) and, wherever that formation has worked, one of the central midfielders, if not both, must cover a lot of ground. When Chelsea won the Premier League title in 2016-17 with that system, they had N’Golo Kante’s unique tenacity allied with Nemanja Matic’s destructive qualities. When Wolves won the Championship title the following season, they had Romain Saiss bringing the ball-winning element in midfield and even Ruben Neves, an astonishing technician, chipped in defensively. Two years later, Coventry were able to get away with having an enigmatic technician like Liam Walsh at the base of midfield enroute to top spot in League One, but that was partly because the other number six was the aggressive Liam Kelly, and ahead of them were terriers Jamie Allen and Callum O’Hare. Last season, Exeter won automatic promotion from League Two, partly thanks to the physicality and dynamism of Timothee Dieng in midfield, but also the stamina of Matt Jay as one of the number 10s – those two were the hardest working on the pitch. In essence, the success of the system depends on wing-backs getting high and wide, so while the deeper midfielders may have some chances to venture forward with a forward drive, a smart carry or an off-the-ball run when things open up accordingly, the remit is mainly covering gaps, stopping counter-attacks and keeping play ticking over. It’s possible to get by with one player in that role who isn’t hugely destructive but does stay deep when required, because that way the team can at least retain a semblance of shape while wing-backs and others reclaim their positions. It’s impossible, though, to make it work without either number six being energetic, tenacious and not shy to the occasional old-school challenge. Hull hope they can make it work with Regan Slater filling that role, after some promise in pre-season. With Alfie Jones set to be classed as a right-sided defender, though, there is nobody else in the squad who can provide the destructive element and relying on the 22-year-old would be a risk, seeing as the club has ambitions of challenging. Slater might well be great, but he didn’t have too many opportunities at Sheffield United and is still, to a point, finding his way at Championship level. After the success of Greaves and Lewis-Potter, Brandon Fleming is another example of what Hull’s excellent academy can produce. The intelligent wing-back was widely considered to be among Hull’s top five performers last season: a notch behind the aforementioned duo, yet at a similar level to Honeyman, Baxter and McLoughlin. Fleming was solid defensively, after recovering from an injury that ruled him out over November and December, and tidy in possession. Without being especially explosive or direct, Fleming’s movement was excellent and that allowed him to ghost into advanced positions unchartered, and thus produce quality deliveries from good positions. If Fleming can overcome the injury troubles that have seen him miss the start of 2022-23, the 22-year-old could go up another level. Much of Hull’s play this season will go through the middle with the increased quality in midfield and attack, as well as the ability of defenders such as Greaves and others to step out of the backline and progress the ball into the middle-third. If opponents allow them to bring the front-three into play at first attempt, then Hull can create chances that way, but if they condense space centrally, the Tigers have another angle of attack. With Coyle and Fleming getting high up the pitch, City will have a late reverse ball in their locker, allowing both wing-backs to find space and get deliveries in. Sometimes, these will be low cut-backs to allow Seri, Tufan or a forward with some clever movement to get an effort at goal from just in front of the defence. Other times, these will be higher crosses to maximize the aerial strength in the front-line. Óscar Estupiñán scored 15 Primeira Liga goals last season, including a league-high seven with his head and more than any other player following a cross (eight). That may also reflect the fact Estupiñán had more headed shots (28) in 2021-22 than his divisional rivals but nonetheless, he’s a threat with the right ammunition. Tetteh, meanwhile, is 6-foot-4 and if he can peel off onto aerially weaker defenders, there may be chances for the Ghana international to do some damage. The 25-year-old was not expected to be at full fitness on the opening day but, after replacing Tyler Smith up top, he offered a crucial reference point to Arveladze’s side and made a difference – the Yeni Malatyaspor recruit could grow as the season goes on, too. Hull under Arveladze look to be neither an intense, high-pressing side, nor a low-block, counter-attacking outfit. Rather, they are happy to let opposing defenders have the ball, but then be very aggressive once the ball comes near the opposing half. Key to this will be Allahyar Sayyadmanesh, who will operate just off the main striker in a narrow front-three. The forward picked up an injury early on after his January loan move, but that may have taken the pressure off the Iranian and allowed him to settle into a new country before having to deliver on the pitch. With that extra time to adjust to English culture, Sayadmannesh finished last season in excellent fashion and if he can put in more performances like the one in the 3-0 win over Reading in April, he could be one of the stars of the Championship. Not only does the 20-year-old press vigorously from the front, but he also doesn’t give up if the initial efforts don’t go to plan: he will track back and make tackles. That aggression will be crucial to ensuring that Sayadmannesh makes the space for his pace, trickery and penchant for a deft finish to come to the fore in the cut-and-thrust of English football’s second tier. Many have argued that the Allam family got a lot wrong at Hull, but one of the things they got right was the work they did on the youth academy. The Tigers have a lot of top talents coming through the ranks, including Andy Smith. The centre-back came off the bench against Fenerbahce in a pre-season friendly and he looked comfortable, amid the hostile atmosphere, reading the game well and being strong in the air. Forward-thinking winger McCauley Snelgrove is now also coming through the ranks: he hit a hat-trick against Sheffield United at U18 level in 2020-21 and has since become an U23 regular. Also coming through are midfielder Callum Jones, Ireland U19’s centre-back Jevon Mills and Bermuda U20’s goalscoring winger Sincere Hall. In addition, the club have recruited for their Development Squad, poaching 19-year-old forward Vaughn Covil – formerly USA U15s and England U16s – from Forest Green. If the U23s setup is strong, the club can focus on recruiting quality over quantity for the first team squad, and not sweat too much about immediate cover when injuries hit. Hull were in good form when Arveladze came in: they’d just won six in 11. It was helpful in some respect, because the players were not short of confidence, but less helpful in others: not all the players would have been in favour of Grant McCann’s dismissal. The football, subsequently, left a little to be desired. This can be accounted for, to some extent, by the absence of personnel in some areas suited to the style. For example, could Arveladze have implemented expansive, possession football with Richie Smallwood at the base of midfield and Tom Eaves up top? Perhaps up to a point, but it would have been difficult because those two players have skillsets that wouldn’t immediately make them natural fits for such an approach and alternatives were scarce. Instead, Arveladze made his side hard to beat and maybe even approached the 19 games with the mindset of just doing enough to tick off the 50 points, knowing he would almost certainly have the summer to evolve the squad to his taste. Following his appointment in late January, only matches involving Blackburn Rovers (1.89) averaged fewer goals per game in the Championship last season than those involving Hull (2.16). Now, though, Arveladze has the personnel he wants. And, while some allowances can be made for the fact it has been a busy summer and a lot of new players are settling into a new country as well as bedding into a new team, but this year’s grace period will only last so long. Hull have been ambitious in the market: now, they intend to deliver.

3220,Liverpool boss Klopp: Nunez was provoked but I'll speak to him about 'wrong reaction' headbutt,"Jurgen Klopp says he will speak to Darwin Nunez about his behaviour after the Liverpool striker was sent off on his first Premier League start. The Uruguayan was shown a straight red card after thrusting his head into Joachim Andersen, the Crystal Palace defender, in the second-half of the sides’ 1-1 draw at Anfield on Monday night. He becomes the first player to be sent off for violent conduct for Liverpool under Klopp, and will now serve a three-game suspension, starting against Manchester United at Old Trafford next week. Speaking in his post-match press conference, Klopp said Nunez had deserved his red card, and said he will speak to the 23-year-old in the coming days. “No, I won’t speak to him for three games!” he joked. “No, I will speak to him of course.  “I wanted to see the situation first. I didn’t know what happened. I saw Andersen on the floor and Darwin walking away. That was my view. So I asked our guys, I saw it and yes it was a red card, the wrong reaction.  “Andersen wanted that and he got it, but Darwin made a mistake.” He added: “A little provocation here and there, and definitely the wrong reaction. I can’t deny that.  “He will learn from that. Unfortunately he will have a few games to do so, which is not cool for us, even less with our specific situation, but it is what it is.” Darwin Nunez really said: pic.twitter.com/JsqLVzqzJ6 Earlier, Klopp had discussed the red card with Sky Sports, saying: “It makes no sense to talk so much in public. It’s absolutely not the reaction we want to see.  “The centre-halves in the Premier League will do that, they want to have him, he’s a handful himself, and that’s not the reaction. “I don’t know how long he will be suspended, but that’s the situation and we will use it for physical work. Not as punishment, just to make him even stronger.” Meanwhile, veteran James Milner said to Sky Sports of the incident: ""He is going to be disappointed in that. We have to get around him and rally. He will learn from it. The team reacted well and the ground did and got behind us."" Liverpool came into the game with a lengthy injury list, with Joel Matip and Roberto Firmino both ruled out, and Joe Gomez and Jordan Henderson fit enough only for a place on the bench. “Joel will be out for two weeks, we will see,” Klopp said afterwards. “The week was crazy. I have experienced a lot of weeks, but it was like we had a witch in the building, honestly! Every day, somebody else pulled out [of training] for the craziest reasons. “Joe didn’t start - Nat [Phillips] did really well, I have to say - because he only trained yesterday after having an issue. Bobby couldn’t make it, with Hendo we got information this morning that there was a little bit of a concern if he plays too long.  “That’s the situation, it was not too cool, but I really liked the game. We wanted to fight and we played really good stuff.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-boss-klopp-nunez-was-provoked-headbutt/blt2842374829fe29df,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11397,FIFA World Cup Hat-Tricks: The Facts,"There have been 52 hat-tricks scored in men’s FIFA World Cup finals tournaments. Some have definitely been more memorable than others, but all hat-tricks are special. We give a rundown of the best facts about World Cup hat-tricks, giving you the need-to-know info. Only one player has scored five goals in a single men’s FIFA World Cup match – Russia’s Oleg Salenko. His five-goal haul came in his nation’s 6-1 group stage thrashing of Cameroon in June 1994. His five goals in this match overshadowed Cameroon striker Roger Milla’s achievement of becoming the oldest player to score at a World Cup, while they took his overall total to six at the USA ’94 World Cup following an earlier goal against Sweden in the group stage. These goals were enough to win him the Golden Boot at the tournament, which he shared with Bulgarian legend Hristo Stoichkov. Whilst his goals helped Russia to victory, they came too late for them to qualify for the knockout stage – their game against Cameroon was a dead rubber, with Sweden and Brazil already sealing the top two spots to make the last 16. Salenko never played for Russia again, and his six goals at the 1994 World Cup were his only ones for his international team. What a way to go out, though. Erich Probst wasn’t hanging about in June 1954. The Austrian scored a hat-trick inside the opening 24 minutes of their group stage match with Czechoslovakia to put them 4-0 up just over a quarter of the way through the match. After Ernst Stojaspal put them into a third-minute lead, Probst added three further goals in the fourth, 21st and 24th minutes to complete the earliest hat-trick ever seen in a men’s World Cup. Whilst it was the earliest scored, it wasn’t the most quickfire in terms of minutes between scoring three goals. That honour belongs to Hungarian László Kiss, who scored a hat-trick in the space of seven minutes and 42 seconds at the 1982 World Cup versus El Salvador – the quickest hat-trick in World Cup history. Pelé remains the youngest player to score a hat-trick at a men’s World Cup, with his treble in Brazil’s 1958 semi-final victory over France coming when he was aged just 17 years and 244 days old – the only player to score one under the age of 18. The only other teenager to score a World Cup hat-trick is German Edmund Conen, who scored three goals against Belgium in May 1934 at the age of 19 years and 198 days old. Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo is the oldest player to score a hat-trick at a World Cup. The current Premier League star was 33 years and 130 days old when he scored all three of his nation’s goals in the 3-3 group stage draw against Spain – his third goal coming from a delightful free-kick past Spain goalkeeper – and current Manchester United team-mate – David de Gea, with only two minutes remaining. This was his 51st hat-trick for club and country, while it was also the 51st hat-trick scored in the history of the World Cup. Rob Rensenbrink had held this record for 30 years following his hat-trick for the Netherlands versus Iran at the 1978 World Cup, when aged 30 years and 335 days old. Only three players have scored a World Cup hat-trick and ended on the losing side – Ernst Wilimowski for Poland in 1938, Josef Hügi for Switzerland in 1954 and Igor Belanov for the USSR in 1986. Spare a thought for Wilimowski in particular – he scored four goals in the 6-5 defeat for Poland against Brazil. These were his only four goals at the World Cup and none of them put his nation into the lead in that match. The only other player to score a hat-trick and not end on the winning side was Cristiano Ronaldo when he scored his three against Spain in 2018 – the game ended 3-3, with his 88th minute goal saving a point for the Portuguese. Just Fontaine is one of only three players to score a hat-trick in two separate matches at the same World Cup finals tournament, alongside Sándor Kocsis (1954) and Gerd Müller (1970), thanks to his trebles against Paraguay and four more goals against Germany in the 1958 tournament. Legendary German striker Müller scored back-to-back hat-tricks in games against Bulgaria and Peru at Mexico 1970, with just three days between the trebles. Only one other player has scored a hat-trick in two consecutive World Cup appearances, that being Hungary’s Kocsis in 1954 (also over a four-day period). The only other player to score multiple hat-tricks at World Cup finals is also the only one to have scored a hat-trick at two different editions of the tournament. Gabriel Batistuta scored three goals against Greece at the 1994 World Cup, before another treble followed four years later at the 1998 tournament, this time versus Jamaica. Both of his hat-tricks came on 21 June, both were scored against World Cup debutants, and both saw the final goal to complete the hat-trick coming from the penalty spot. Was it easier to score hat-tricks in earlier World Cup tournaments? It seems so – a mixture of rules being kinder to attacking players, plus a bigger disparity between nations could be possible explanations for this. Of the 52 World Cup hat-tricks, the first half (26) came in the opening eight World Cup tournaments, while the next 26 have spanned across the following 13 World Cup editions, despite those editions featuring more matches. Just over 15% of all World Cup hat-tricks came in the 1958 tournament – no edition has seen as many as the eight scored that year. The only World Cup tournament to not see a single hat-trick scored was the 2006 edition in Germany. The holy day for hat-tricks. Twenty-two of the World Cup hat-tricks have been scored on Sundays, which is twice as many as the next most prolific day – a Saturday (11). Every day of the week has witnessed a World Cup hat-trick, but only one has been scored on a Monday in the history of the competition. That treble was scored by Pauleta for Portugal vs. Poland at the 2002 World Cup group stage. Geoff Hurst remains the only player in the history of the World Cup to score a hat-trick in the final. His iconic treble for England against West Germany in 1966 at Wembley was sealed in the final minute of extra time, helping the Three Lions to a 4-2 victory – England’s only World Cup title. Hurst scored more goals in this match (three) than he did in his other five World Cup appearances combined (two). Ademir was the scorer of four goals in Brazil’s 7-1 victory over Sweden in the final group round of the 1950 World Cup, but the World Cup ‘final’ that year is widely regarded to have been the Brazilian’s 2-1 defeat to Uruguay in the final decider of the tournament. 1930 World Cup (Uruguay) 17 July 1930         Bert Patenaude: USA vs. Paraguay – 3 goals19 July 1930         Guillermo Stabile: Argentina vs. Mexico – 3 goals27 July 1930         Pedro Cea: Uruguay vs. Yugoslavia – 3 goals 1934 World Cup (Italy) 27 May 1934         Angelo Schiavio: Italy vs. USA – 3 goals27 May 1934         Edmund Conen: Germany vs. Belgium – 3 goals03 June 1934        Oldrich Nejedly: Czechoslovakia vs. Germany – 3 goals 1938 World Cup (France) 05 June 1938        Leônidas: Brazil vs. Poland – 3 goals05 June 1938        Ernst Wilimowski: Poland vs. Brazil – 4 goals12 June 1938        Gustav Wetterström: Sweden vs. Cuba – 3 goals12 June 1938        Harry Andersson: Sweden vs. Cuba – 3 goals 1950 World Cup (Brazil) 02 July 1950         Oscar Miguez: Uruguay vs. Bolivia – 3 goals09 July 1950         Ademir: Brazil vs. Sweden – 4 goals 1954 World Cup (Switzerland) 17 June 1954        Sándor Kocsis: Hungary vs. Korea Republic – 3 goals19 June 1954        Carlos Borges: Uruguay vs. Scotland – 3 goals19 June 1954        Erich Probst: Austria vs. Czechoslovakia – 3 goals20 June 1954        Burhan Sargun: Turkey vs. Korea Republic – 3 goals20 June 1954        Sándor Kocsis: Hungary vs. Germany – 4 goals23 June 1954        Max Morlock: Germany vs. Turkey – 3 goals26 June 1954        Josef Hügi: Switzerland vs. Austria – 3 goals26 June 1954        Theodor Wagner: Austria vs. Switzerland – 3 goals 1958 World Cup (Sweden) 08 June 1958        Just Fontaine: France vs. Paraguay – 3 goals24 June 1958        Pelé: Brazil vs. France – 3 goals28 June 1958        Just Fontaine: France vs. Germany – 4 goals 1962 World Cup (Chile) 03 June 1962        Flórián Albert: Hungary vs. Bulgaria – 3 goals 1966 World Cup (England) 23 July 1966         Eusébio: Portugal vs. DPR Korea – 4 goals30 July 1966         Geoff Hurst: England vs. Germany – 3 goals 1970 World Cup (Mexico) 07 June 1970        Gerd Müller: Germany vs. Bulgaria – 3 goals10 June 1970        Gerd Müller: Germany vs. Peru – 3 goals 1974 World Cup (West Germany) 18 June 1974        Dusan Bajevic: Yugoslavia vs. Congo DR – 3 goals19 June 1974        Andrzej Szarmach: Poland vs. Haiti – 3 goals 1978 World Cup (Argentina) 03 June 1978        Rob Rensenbrink: Netherlands vs. IR Iran – 3 goals11 June 1978        Téofilo Cubillas: Peru vs. IR Iran – 3 goals 1982 World Cup (Spain) 15 June 1982        Laszlo Kiss: Hungary vs. El Salvador – 3 goals20 June 1982        Karl-Heinz Rummenigge: Germany vs. Chile – 3 goals28 June 1982        Zbigniew Boniek: Poland vs. Belgium – 3 goals05 July 1982         Paolo Rossi: Italy vs. Brazil – 3 goals 1986 World Cup (Mexico) 08 June 1986        Preben Elkjær Larsen: Denmark vs. Uruguay – 3 goals11 June 1986        Gary Lineker: England vs. Poland – 3 goals15 June 1986        Igor Belanov: USSR vs. Belgium – 3 goals18 June 1986        Emilio Butragueño: Spain vs. Denmark – 4 goals 1990 World Cup (Italy) 17 June 1990        Michel: Spain vs. Korea Republic – 3 goals23 June 1990        Tomas Skuhravy: Czechoslovakia vs. Costa Rica – 3 goals 1994 World Cup (United States) 21 June 1994        Gabriel Batistuta: Argentina vs. Greece – 3 goals28 June 1994        Oleg Salenko: Russia vs. Cameroon – 5 goals 1998 World Cup (France) 21 June 1998        Gabriel Batistuta: Argentina vs. Jamaica – 3 goals 2002 World Cup (Japan & South Korea) 01 June 2002        Miroslav Klose: Germany vs. Saudi Arabia – 3 goals10 June 2002        Pauleta: Portugal vs. Poland – 3 goals 2006 World Cup (Germany) No hat-tricks scored 2010 World Cup (South Africa) 17 June 2010        Gonzalo Higuaín: Argentina vs. Korea Republic – 3 goals 2014 World Cup (Brazil) 16 June 2014        Thomas Müller: Germany vs. Portugal – 3 goals25 June 2014        Xherdan Shaqiri: Switzerland vs. Honduras – 3 goals 2018 World Cup (Russia) 15 June 2018        Cristiano Ronaldo: Portugal vs. Spain – 3 goals24 June 2018        Harry Kane: England vs. Panama – 3 goals Enjoy this? Subscribe to our newsletter to receive five stories each Friday.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2022/11/world-cup-hat-tricks-fifa/,Matt Furniss,17/11/2022 6:41,the-analyst

10430,Portsmouth’s Promotion Charge: The Data Behind Their Successful Start to 2023-24,"The 2000s were an exciting time to be a Portsmouth fan. Backed by the finances of Milan Mandarić, a second-tier title in 2002-03 was followed by seven successive seasons of Premier League football, an FA Cup trophy in 2008 and a foray into Europe that saw Italian giants Milan visit Fratton Park. Then the bubble burst.  In February 2010 they became the first (and so far, only) Premier League club to enter administration, with nine points docked from their tally on the way to finishing bottom of the top flight. In truth, they’d have been relegated without it. Portsmouth flew too close to the sun and paid the price. Within four seasons of playing Premier League football, Portsmouth had fallen to the fourth tier of the English league, which included back-to-back relegations from the Championship and League One. It took them four seasons of League Two football before winning a promotion with their title success in 2016-17, but they’ve been unable to work their way out of League One in six complete campaigns since. But this season feels different. Still unbeaten 15 games into the League One season and top of the league with 35 points, Portsmouth could be set to win promotion back to the second tier of the English football pyramid – heights that they haven’t reached since relegation in 2012. That 15-game unbeaten start replicates the efforts of just six previous teams in the third tier of English football. Only half of those won promotion the same season, with the last team to do it – Shrewsbury Town in 2017-18 – missing out in the play-offs after finishing third. Portsmouth still have some way to go to match the efforts of the 1973-74 vintage of Bristol Rovers, who opened that season with a 27-game undefeated streak (W15 D12 L0) before eventually losing their 28th match of the campaign en route to promotion. Portsmouth’s points tally (35) from their opening 15 games matches that of title-winners Plymouth Argyle last season, although Steven Schumacher’s side had lost twice by this point (W11 D2). Four of the last six teams to win at least 35 points from their opening 15 games of a League One season have gone on to win promotion that campaign – three as title winners – but Leyton Orient (2013-14) and Shrewsbury (2017-18) both secured more points (38 and 37, respectively) and finished third before losing in the play-offs. Portsmouth’s upturn in fortunes didn’t just suddenly occur following a strong pre-season, though. They’ve been one of the best teams in England’s professional leagues since making the brave managerial appointment of inexperienced John Mousinho earlier in 2023. Mousinho is currently the youngest permanent manager in League One, aged 37 years and 181 days old when leading his Portsmouth side to victory over Reading in their last league match on 28 November. Across the top four tiers in England, he’s the third youngest, with only Sheffield Wednesday’s new 34-year-old boss Danny Röhl and the excellent Ipswich Town coach Kieran McKenna younger (by 14 days). Mousinho was appointed Portsmouth manager on 20 January 2023. It was his first managerial job and came just 65 days after making his final appearance as a professional player at fellow League One side Oxford United in an FA Cup tie versus Woking. His appointment was another shrewd move from the south coast side following their grab of Richard Hughes as sporting director just four months earlier, leaving a similar position at Forest Green Rovers, whom he helped to the League Two title in 2021-22 alongside manager Rob Edwards. Mousinho only had one training session with the side before his first game as head coach – a 2-0 home win over Exeter a day after his appointment – which ended a run of just one win and 11 points collected in 15 League One matches, of which 14 were under former boss Danny Cowley. Mousinho had equalled that points tally (11) within his opening seven league games, and it would only get better from there. Since his appointment as boss, only Ipswich (83) and Stockport County (77) have won more points across the top four tiers in England than Portsmouth (74), while Pompey are now on a club-record 26-game unbeaten league run in the EFL. They last lost a league match on 11 March versus Sheffield Wednesday, who went on to earn promotion, while only nine clubs have ever managed a longer undefeated streak across the second, third or fourth tiers of the English Football League. They are now just four games off becoming only the sixth club to enjoy a sequence of 30+ games without a defeat in those leagues. Across League One this season, Portsmouth have been leading for 31% of game time. That proportion is lower than 10 other clubs, including their two closest challengers Oxford United (55%) and Bolton Wanderers (52%), who lead the rankings. They’ve fallen behind in seven of their 15 league matches this season but haven’t lost any of those (winning five and drawing two). Importantly, when they fall behind, they recover quickly. Only Peterborough and Bolton (11%) have been in a losing position for a lower proportion of game time than Pompey in 2023-24 across League One. In fact, almost half of Portsmouth’s league points this season have been gained from losing positions. Their tally of 17 points won from behind is not only the most in League One this season, but also the highest across England’s top four tiers in 2023-24 and drew level with their own tally in League One last season following a comeback win at Reading on Saturday, when they won 3-2 after being 2-0 down inside 27 minutes. Having character to win points in games where you fall behind is an important trait to have as an EFL side. Of course, you’d rather your side didn’t trail, but the reality is that over a 46-game season where not a lot separates a good bulk of sides in terms of quality, it’s tricky to dominate matches across the full 90 minutes. Three of the last four seasons in League One have seen the team to win the most points from losing positions seal automatic promotion. Last season saw Plymouth promoted as champions from the third tier after winning a league-high 27 points from losing positions. Before that, Peterborough finished second with help from 23 points won from behind in 2020-21, and Coventry recovered a league-high 19 points from losing positions in 2019-20 on the way to the title. Even in 2021-22, MK Dons finished third and a point off automatic promotion having recovered the most points from behind in League One (25). Not uncommon for sides lower down the EFL pyramid, even more so with a manager taking charge of his first pre-season, Portsmouth had a big overhaul of playing staff in the summer. Many of their incomings have played a big role in their success in 2023-24, with five of the eight players to play the most minutes of League One football for Portsmouth this season joining the club either permanently or on loan in the most recent transfer window. Goalkeeper Will Norris and central defensive partners Regan Poole and Conor Shaughnessy are three of the four most used players, alongside fantastic striker Colby Bishop. Mousinho’s signings of the defensive triangle in goal and the heart of his defence have proved to be a key reason for their success, with the trio impressing across the campaign so far. Norris is involved in building the play out from the back, with the 30-year-old involved in 37 open-play passing sequences per 90 minutes – the only goalkeeper to be involved in more is Port Vale’s Connor Ripley (38 per 90). Poole (47 per 90) and Shaughnessy (45 per 90) are also among the top 10 for regular central defenders in the division, too. The two centre-backs are brilliant at carrying the ball out of defence as well, with only Peterborough’s Ronnie Edwards (152 metres) and Blackpool’s James Husband (114m) averaging more progressive carry metres per 90 minutes than the Portsmouth pair (both 111m). Building out from the back is a key component of Mousinho’s philosophy at Portsmouth, with three defenders – Poole (82), right-sided defender Joe Rafferty (82) and Shaughnessy (78) – averaging the most touches of the ball per 90 minutes in League One for the club this season. Their biggest threat, Bishop, doesn’t see much of the ball, with the 26-year-old averaging the fewest touches in the squad this season (39 per 90). But none of that matters when he receives the ball where he’s most dangerous. He’s had the most touches in the opposition box across League One this season (105), as well as the most shots on target (24) and the second most shots (49). And, among players to feature for at least 750 minutes, he’s got the highest non-penalty expected goals average per 90 (0.49). Bishop is the jewel in the Portsmouth crown. The current second-highest scorer in League One with nine goals in 15 appearances this term, this is his fifth successive season at this level after three campaigns at Accrington Stanley before signing for Portsmouth in July 2022. Across those five seasons since the start of 2019-20, he’s scored 61 League One goals (all inside the penalty area) – only Jonson Clarke-Harris (75) has more. What makes this more impressive is that Bishop was playing part-time in the sixth tier of English football for Leamington before making a leap of three divisions. While he isn’t the tallest player you’ll find in the English leagues at 5-foot-11, he’s excellent aerially, with Portsmouth utilising this ability to full effect. The striker has the most headed shots (17) and headed shots on target (9) in League One this season, while only one striker – 6-foot-4 Aaron Pressley of Stevenage – has been involved in, or won, more aerial duels than Bishop has (161, with 84 won). There is no single player that’s a creative spark for Portsmouth this season – 19 different players have created more open-play chances than any Pompey player, and that’s top-scorer Bishop (16), with many of those coming from open-play situations that have seen Portsmouth cross the ball in from wide areas via full-backs Rafferty on the right and Jack Sparkes on the left. No team have successfully found a teammate with more open-play crosses than Portsmouth (71) in League One this season, while only Peterborough (310) have attempted more than Mousinho’s side (269) overall. This tactic has paid dividends for Portsmouth, with the south coast side creating the most chances (38) and assisting the most goals (6) via open-play crosses than every other team in the division. This threat extends to set-piece delivery, too. No side have generated an expected goals (xG) total from non-penalty set-pieces in League One this season as high as Portsmouth’s 8.7, while they have also scored a league-high eight goals from these situations. Obviously aided by the chaos of having to come from behind so often in games this season, Portsmouth are a team keen to get the ball in attacking areas of the pitch. They have the highest field tilt – a metric which measures a team’s possession in the attacking third compared to their opponents – in the league at 62.7%, they have had the most touches in the opposition box (413) and are tied at the top with Blackpool for the average quality of non-penalty shots in League One, with the average xG of their non-pen chances at 0.11. They only trail Stevenage (660) for penalty area entries (605) in the third tier across 2023-24, but unlike Steve Evans’ team, Portsmouth aren’t a direct side who are disinterested in building long chains of possession. Despite a shock FA Cup defeat to National League leaders Chesterfield in the first round last weekend, Portsmouth will hope to resume their league campaign with a home win versus bottom-half side Charlton at Fratton Park on Saturday afternoon. With a potentially record-breaking unbeaten run and a lead at the top of League One to protect, all eyes will be on Mousinho’s side to see if they can sustain their form and prevail in their quest to return to the Championship in 2024 after a 12-year absence. The progress they’ve made in 2023 under their young and progressive coach are overwhelmingly positive, that’s for sure. Enjoy this?

3097,WATCH: Torino sporting director flips out & attacks head coach Juric amid lack of signings & allegedly calls club president a 'd*ckhead',"Torino sporting director Davide Vagnati has been caught on camera screaming at and attempting to attack the club’s head coach, Ivan Juric, with issues regarding recruitment in the summer transfer window seeing tempers threaten to boil over. The Serie A outfit are currently in Austria as part of their pre-season programme, but preparations for the 2022-23 campaign do not appear to be playing out as planned. Vagnati is prevented from sparking an all-out brawl with a colleague by the presence of another member of staff, with all concerned now trying to brush the unfortunate incident under the carpet, but divides have clearly formed in the camp as questions are also asked of who leaked the video from inside a venue occupied by players and coaches. Dopo l’esclusiva le prove! Lite furibonda Vagnati-Juric… sentite anche audio @tvdellosport @AlfredoPedulla @Glongari @Parpiglia @TorinoFC_1906 pic.twitter.com/wyuQV6Oj1Q At one point, director Vagnati can be heard saying “I am the only one who defends you from that d*ckhead”, which appears to be a reference to club president Urbano Cairo. He also says: “You just coach the team I give you, understand? I’ve had enough of you, you need to show respect”, with Juric making no secret of the fact that he would have liked to see more movement on the incomings front during the current transfer window. After becoming the subject of unwanted attention and headlines in Italy, Vagnati claims to have “hugged it out” with Juric as the pair look to make Torino as competitive as possible for the upcoming campaign. He has told Sky Sport Italia: “There was a discussion, as you saw, it’s certainly not a nice thing to see, but when two people really care about doing things right, these things happen. “The coach certainly wants the players as soon as possible, we in the club are trying to do what is possible in a difficult transfer market. We will bring the players that he wants. “We said what we needed to say, we hugged it out afterwards. We are two real people, two very honest people who say things to people’s faces, so thanks also to these discussions we can start again in the best possible way for Torino. “We have a great coach, we will try to do the right things as soon as possible, because it is true that we need to get more players.” Quizzed on his “d*ckhead” quip, which many consider to have been a dig at president Cairo, Juric added: “When there are arguments, you say things that perhaps you don’t mean. That’s not the point, it’s about understanding why it happened, which is that we both want what is best for the club and we must try to give him the players as soon as possible. “The coach has his concerns, they are legitimate, we understand that and will try to do what needs to be done as soon as possible. “It won’t be 10 players, it’ll be less than that, but we need them to be the right ones so that we can complete the squad.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/watch-torino-head-coach-screams-attacks-sporting-director/blt8dfec0d49dc26933,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1594,VAR saves Man Utd: Why was McTominay not sent off & Maddison's goal disallowed in 1-1 draw with Leicester?,"Manchester United were able to salvage a point in Saturday's Premier League clash against Leicester, largely thanks to the officials. After Kelechi Iheanacho opened the scoring for the visitors at Old Trafford, Fred levelled matters just three minutes later with a goal for the hosts. But, with 10 minutes left on the clock, James Maddison thought he had restored his side's lead and given them the three points, but it was not to be. ❌ NO GOAL ❌VAR intervention sees the goal NOT given... https://t.co/BxHym5fagU The James Maddison goal is ruled out due to VAR. Varane was fouled moments before the goal.📺: @USA_Network & @NBCUniverso #MyPLMorning | #MUNLEI pic.twitter.com/3L9sBtuLtT Maddison celebrated his goal, confident that he had netted the match-winning goal for his team. However, the celebration was soon cut short as VAR intervened. Referee Andre Marriner then disallowed the goal after the replay showed that there had been a foul on defender Raphael Varane from Iheanacho in the build-up. There were calls for United midfielder McTominay to be sent off early in the second half. Maddison was again the victim when the Scotland international slid in with what appeared to be a dangerous challenge. McTominay's foot was high as he went in, sending Maddison flying, and the referee called for a foul. Despite the dangerous tackle, McTominay was allowed to stay on the field as he was only given a yellow card as VAR did not intervene further following Marriner's initial decision. He was then substituted six minutes later with Marcus Rashford replacing him.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/var-saves-man-utd-why-was-mctominay-not-sent-off-and/blt3abae443cdee2a90,By Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
9626,How Real Madrid can lineup for Girona game with all centre-backs injured,"It's not a myth. When Real Madrid trained on Wednesday ahead of their game against Girona this weekend, they did so without any fit centre-back. Carlo Ancelotti had to do without Nacho who pulled off after complaining of muscle overload. Antonio Rudiger also missed the session as he's still struggling with the blow he suffered at Getafe. With Real Madrid unable to count on David Alaba and Eder Militao for some considerable period, it leaves the team in limbo going into the business end of the season. For the Girona game, there's a real possibility that Ancelotti will have to set up his team without a natural centre-back in defence. Starting Tchoumeni at centre-back makes sense considering he's played there before. Carvajal is too small to partner with Tchouameni as Real Madrid could get bullied with aerial balls. Also, Camavinga would help Los Blancos more as the defensive midfielder. That leaves Ferland Mendy as the best bet at left-center-back considering how defensively solid he is.

5086,Unusual silence from Caf leaves observers wondering whether 2021 awards gala will ever be held,"The Confederation of African Football has maintained an unusual silence regarding the annual Caf Awards last held in January 2020 to honour the continent’s outstanding players of 2019. Liverpool and Senegal forward Sadio Mane and his Barcelona and Nigeria counterpart Asisat Oshoala were crowned Africa’s men and women’s Player of the Year, respectively, at the awards gala held at the Albatros Citadel Sahl Hasheesh Resort in Hurghada, Egypt. In what was the 28th edition of the awards, Algeria’s Djamel Belmadi was named Coach of the Year after leading the Desert Foxes to the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations title while Paris Saint Germain right-back Achraf Hakimi received the Young Player of the Year gong. However, since then, the ceremony has not been held. The 2020 edition was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic which made gatherings impossible but Caf promised to hold the two subsequent events, having received assurances from their sponsors. “Cancellation of the 2020 edition. Major partners for the event, Pickalbatros Group, has re-affirmed their contractual commitment towards the next two editions,” Caf said in a statement on their website, while announcing the cancellation of the 2020 event. But two years later, nothing has been forthcoming with the African football governing body maintaining silence on the matter. Two months ago, there were reports that Caf was determined to hold the awards before the end of March and that what was delaying it was the unavailability of a suitable venue, but that did not materialise. La #Caf tiendra bien sa cérémonie des CAF AWARDS 2021, probablement avant le 31 Mars 2022. Le retard est dû au fait que l’instance n’a pas encore trouvé une ville pour accueillir la cérémonie, et P. Motsepe ne veut pas la tenir en virtuel. Mais elle aura lieu, de source sûre. pic.twitter.com/epsimEPXtn Sources have, however, told GOAL that the awards might not happen for reasons still unknown while Caf president Patrice Mostepe, elected unopposed in March 2021, has also kept off the subject. But while Caf is mute, it is important to note the importance of these awards. They do not just provide prestige and recognition to the winners but also motivate others to do better. Before 1994, France Football magazine, organisers of the prestigious Ballon d’Or Awards, chose the best African footballer before Caf, until former president Issa Hayatou took over. If Caf does not hold the 2021 awards, a number of players and teams will feel hard done by. Senegal, who won a maiden African Cup of Nations are favourites to scoop most of the 2021 awards with Mane seen as the main contender yet again, having been named the best player of the tournament. Mane will definitely face competition from Liverpool team-mate Mohamed Salah, who made the Afcon final with Egypt before losing on post-match penalties, as well as Algerian international Riyad Mahrez of Manchester City. Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy would be a shoo-in for the Golden Glove Award following his heroics at the Afcon and Chelsea, where he won the Uefa Champions League last year. The 2021-22 league season is coming to an end this month and already, a number of African stars have placed themselves in contention for the 2022 award after stellar performances for their teams. Even if the Fifa World Cup later in the year might tilt the scales, it would be unfortunate if the conversation shifts to 2022 when the top performers of 2021 have not been celebrated.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/unusual-silence-from-caf-leaves-observers-wondering-whether-2021-/bltd0767bfbf07b071e,Joel Omotto,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

3325,'Bale always wants to speak Spanish!' - LAFC star Sanchez says ex-Real Madrid star is a perfect fit,"LAFC midfielder Ilie Sanchez says that Gareth Bale fits right in at the club, adding that the former Real Madrid star only speaks Spanish to many of his teammates. Bale was often criticised by the Spanish press, who alleged that Bale had little desire to master the language despite his extended stay in Madrid. However, Bale showed off his fluent Spanish upon being signed by LAFC, and Sanchez says that the multilingual Wales star has already become a major figure with his teammates. ""It has been a confidence boost,"" Sanchez told AS of Bale's signing. ""That a footballer of his enormous level has decided to come highlights our project, I admit it, when you see that he is now your team-mate, that makes us push a little harder to compete and to try to win. And everything we have seen and felt with him is pure commitment. He wants to help us win titles. ""Gareth speaks to me in Spanish. I am the only Spaniard, but there are a lot of South American and Central Americans in the squad. And he just wants to speak Spanish with us. In fact, sometimes we speak to him in English and he answers us in Spanish!  ""He is involved. The other day he went through the welcoming rite at the stadium cheering the fans on with the megaphone. We also did it to [Giorgio] Chiellini. He looks happy."" The Spanish midfielder has been a mainstay in MLS since joining Sporting KC in 2017, establishing himself as one of the best midfielders in MLS in the years since. Sanchez has been named an MLS All-Star for the second time this season and will represent LAFC at the annual game against the Liga MX All-Stars on August 10. Now in his fifth year in the U.S., the Barcelona-born midfielder will receive his citizenship later this year and could, theoretically, play for the U.S. men's national team. ""Yes, I have been in the United States for almost six years and when I arrived in Kansas City they gave me a green residence card,"" he said. ""From there, after five years you can apply for citizenship and a passport. I will do it in September. I have to take an exam and I want to integrate even more here. ""It would be a unique opportunity [to play for the USMNT]. I doubt that it will happen, I don't know, it is also true that I doubted being in the All-Star and it has happened... ""Many factors have to be met that are not in my hands. Once you have the passport, we'll talk.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bale-always-wants-to-speak-spanish-lafc-star-sanchez-says-ex/blte4331f527dc4593f,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11092,Bayern vs Dortmund: Prediction and Preview,"In what is the tightest title race across Europe’s major leagues, Borussia Dortmund head to Bayern Munich with a one-point lead over their Bundesliga rivals. We look ahead to Saturday’s match with the key Opta insights and supercomputer prediction. Whilst this is the 19th time that Bayern and Dortmund face each other while occupying the top two places in the Bundesliga table, it’s only the fifth time that BVB lead Bayern in the standings across those occasions. This happened most recently on matchday 28 of 2018-19, when Bayern hammered Dortmund 5-0 at the Allianz Arena to overtake their rivals and eventually win the Bundesliga title. This result was no outlier in recent years, as Bayern have had the upper hand over Dortmund for some time now. BVB can gain confidence from their 2-2 home draw with the reigning champions earlier this season, though, as that result ended a sequence of seven successive Bundesliga defeats to Bayern Munich. The Allianz Arena hasn’t been a venue that Borussia Dortmund have enjoyed playing at in recent memory, with Bayern winning their last eight successive home games in league competition against them whilst averaging more than four goals per game on average (33-6 aggregate score). Across their history in the Bundesliga, Dortmund have only had a longer losing streak away from home against one opponent, losing 10 successive trips to Werder Bremen between 1979 and 1989. The impact of this result on the Bundesliga title race makes this the most exciting ‘Klassiker’ in quite some time, but just to add further intrigue to the game, Bayern decided to part ways with manager Julian Nagelsmann during the international break and replaced him with no other than former Dortmund manager Thomas Tuchel. Tuchel took charge of Borussia Dortmund from 2015-2017, where he averaged 2.09 points per game in the Bundesliga, which is a club record by a head coach in the competition. Across all competitions since 1963, only one Dortmund coach to have taken charge of at least 20 matches is able to match Tuchel’s 63% win ratio at the club – current boss Edin Terzic, who has also won 63% of games. Key players look set to be missing from both sides for this huge game. Just as in the first league meeting between the sides back in October, BVB goalkeeper Gregor Kobel is likely to miss out through injury, as will Bayern’s first choice Manuel Neuer. Other Borussia Dortmund players that look doubtful or are completely ruled out for this game include Julian Brandt, Karim Adeyemi, Jamie Bynoe-Gittens and Youssoufa Moukoko, while Lucas Hernandez is certainly out for Bayern. The record Bundesliga champions will be sweating on the fitness of two of their biggest goal threats – top scorer Jamal Musiala (11 goals plus eight assists) and Eric Choupo-Moting (10 goals) face a race against time to be ready for selection. Dortmund’s winless streak against Bayern Munich stretched to eight successive Bundesliga matches earlier this season when they drew 2-2 at Signal Iduna Park – although it would have felt like a win to Edin Terzic’s side. Leon Goretzka and Leroy Sane had put Bayern 2-0 up in Dortmund, but for the first time since a 3-3 draw in 2006, Dortmund managed to pick up points from a two-goal deficit in a league game versus Bayern. Anthony Modeste was the unlikely hero for BVB and collected two of his three Bundesliga goal involvements of the season in this single match. He assisted Youssoufa Moukoko for their first goal before scoring the equaliser deep into added time. That goal remains the Frenchman’s last goal involvement in the Bundesliga to date. To add to Bayern’s pain, Kingsley Coman was sent off in second-half injury time after receiving a second yellow card. While Bayern dominated possession (56%), it was Dortmund who were the more dangerous side, firing more shots (12-9) and generating a higher xG total (1.6-0.6) than their Bavarian counterparts. Bayern’s nine shots were their fewest in a Bundesliga match against Dortmund since April 2015 (six in a 1-0 win), with the Bavarians scoring both their goals in the reverse fixture from distance. Bayern Munich have won just five of their 10 Bundesliga matches in 2023 so far (D3 L2), and with 52 points from 25 games, this is their weakest Bundesliga season in 11 years. Back in 2011-12 they had 51 points from their opening 25 games and that season, Borussia Dortmund won the title with Bayern finishing eight points behind in second. That remains the last Bundesliga campaign that Bayern failed to win. Bayern have shown a particular weakness defensively in the new year, conceding 14 goals across 10 league games (1.40 per game). Before the turn of 2023, Bayern had conceded just 13 times across 15 Bundesliga games (0.87). In Nagelsmann’s final match in charge at Bayern, they lost 2-1 away at Bayer Leverkusen, despite taking the lead. This was the first time that they have lost a Bundesliga game this season from a leading position, while both of Leverkusen’s goals came from penalties – the first occasion that Bayern had conceded twice from the penalty spot in the same Bundesliga game in 30 years (April 1993 vs. Werder Bremen). Bayern will hope to lean upon their excellent home form, with the record champions unbeaten in 19 Bundesliga matches at the Allianz Arena (W13 D6), while they have scored in each of their last 52 home league games there (171 goals, 3.29 per game). Tuchel will hope to get off to a good start there, too – no Bayern coach has lost their first ever league game in charge of the club since Franz Beckenbauer in February 1994 (3-1 at home vs. VfB Stuttgart). While Bayern have struggled, opponents Borussia Dortmund have been near perfect in 2023, winning 28 of a possible 30 points this year. That points tally is seven more than any other team and 10 more than Bayern, while they also lead the Bundesliga rankings for goals (30), total shots (165) and expected goals (21.4) since the new year. Going into the break for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, BVB were in sixth position in the table and nine points behind Bayern – now they find themselves top for the first time since MD2 of the 2019-20 season. Any doubts that Dortmund would begin to wobble following a week that saw them lose 2-0 to Chelsea in the UEFA Champions League and then draw 2-2 with rivals Schalke 04 just four days later were brushed aside with a dominant 6-1 home win over Köln before the international break. It was the first time they had scored six goals in a Bundesliga match under Edin Terzic. It is never easy to predict the changes a new coach is going to make, but Tuchel should find it hard to look past the experienced Thomas Müller. In the final match before the international break, Müller was subbed off at half time at Leverkusen with Bayern still leading 1-0. Without Müller the Bavarians went on to lose the match, ultimately costing Nagelsmann his job. The match at Leverkusen was just one of two starts in the Bundesliga Rückrunde in which Müller failed to register a goal involvement, the other one was in the 3-2 loss at Gladbach, when he was subbed off after 16 minutes due to Dayot Upamecano’s dismissal. In his other five appearances as a starter in the second half of the 2022-23 Bundesliga season, Müller racked up two goals and four assists, including at least one goal involvement in each of his three starts at the Allianz Arena during this time (one goal, three assists). With wonderkid Jamal Musiala doubtful for the match after suffering an injury in the match against Leverkusen, Müller’s creativity will be key for the Bavarians. After all, he still leads all Bundesliga players on a per 90 basis for big chances created (0.8), open play expected assists (0.4) and assists (0.6) this season. Müller has regularly haunted Dortmund, with his six goals and nine assists the most goal involvements of any current Bundesliga player against BVB in league competition. Unlike many of his team-mates Müller did not have any international duties in the past two weeks and thus is both well rested and has been able to spend more time to get to know his new manager. Left-back Raphael Guerreiro is often seen as a perfect embodiment of Borussia Dortmund. He can produce breath-taking moments going forward – tallying 29 goals and 33 assists in 153 Bundesliga matches – yet the Portuguese international can also be sluggish in his defensive work. Most recently, just as the rest of the team, Guerreiro has been his showcasing only his best form in the Bundesliga. Guerreiro has been directly involved in nine goals in the second half of this Bundesliga season (two goals, seven assists in five games), a league best, as is his 3.2 open-play chances created per 90 minutes across this period. In 2023 so far, no other player within the top five European leagues has as many assists as the Dortmund star (seven). For the most recent two league matches, Terzic has moved Guerreiro from his original position as a left-back to central midfield and it paid dividends for Dortmund, with the Portuguese both scoring and assisting in each of those games (two goals, three assists). Across those last two matchdays, no player in the Bundesliga has been involved in as many attacking sequences as Guerreiro (19) whose attacking prowess became even more important following Julian Brandt’s absence due to injury. It is not the first time that Guerreiro has been deployed in central midfield for Dortmund, he had done so in his first season with the club in 2016-17. Dortmund’s coach back then? You’ve guessed it: Tuchel. The Opta supercomputer makes Bayern Munich heavy favourites for Der Klassiker on Saturday, with Thomas Tuchel given a 66.8% chance of picking up a win in his first game in charge of the club. Despite their great form in 2023, Borussia Dortmund are only given a 13.9% chance of winning, with the supercomputer believing Bayern’s impressive home form will be the deciding factor. One thing is for sure: the result of this match will have huge ramifications for the Bundesliga title race. Despite currently sitting second in the Bundesliga table, the Opta supercomputer still gives Bayern a massive 75.4% chance of winning their 11th successive German top-flight title. Dortmund’s 23.4% chance will be dramatically improved should they win this game, jumping to 54% and above Bayern’s 46%. Should Bayern defeat Dortmund at home yet again, it looks like it’ll be their title to lose, with their chances improving from 75.4% to 89%.

2091,Dembele re-signs for Barcelona on two-year deal as winger accepts pay cut to remain at Camp Nou,"Barcelona have announced that they have re-signed Ousmane Dembele on a two-year contract that will keep him at Camp Nou through to 2024. The player's agent and the Catalan club found an agreement last week to make the winger extend his stay, and it has now been made official. Dembele's previous deal with Barcelona ended on June 30 and the World Cup winner was a free agent. However, Xavi still sees the France international as an instrumental player and pleaded with the board to tie him down to fresh terms. Dembele has re-signed for Barca for the next two years, with his new contract not due to expire until June 30, 2024. The forward has also agreed to a massive pay cut that has reportedly seen his salary reduced by 40 per cent. However, variables have also been included based on his participation and performance in the upcoming two seasons. If he manages to tick all the boxes he will receive a salary of around €10 million-per-year. 2̵0̵2̵2̵ 2024𝐍𝐎𝐖, 𝐘𝐄𝐒! pic.twitter.com/Exv7olDDwc There were a string of clubs who were fighting to sign Dembele after he became a free agent. Chelsea were reportedly among those that wanted to bring in the winger as Thomas Tuchel had already worked with him at Borussia Dortmund. However, Raheem Sterling was above Dembele in their priority list, and signing the Manchester City star saw the Blues cool their interest. Paris Saint-Germain were also eager to take Dembele to Parc des Princes, while there was significant interest from German giants Bayern Munich, who are in danger of losing top scorer Robert Lewandowski to Barca. The Frenchman has claimed that remaining at Barca was always his preferred option, saying at the official announcement of his new deal: “I feel very happy about the renewal. Barca has been my dream club since I was little. I really want the season to start and give it my all. “The first years when I arrived here were difficult for me with all the injuries, but now I now feel part of the team and the city and I will continue to defend the crest. “My renewal has always been a priority for me. I told the boss and coach about that. It took a long time, but now everyone is happy. I’m looking forward to starting the season and helping the team. Barca have to compete for La Liga and the Champions League. “I will work hard with the coach. Hopefully this is the year for me and Barca.” Dembele managed to score one goal and provide 13 assists in 21 league outings for Barcelona in the 2021-22 campaign. He is one of the players that Xavi likes to count on. However, he will face stiff competition for his place from Ansu Fati, Ferran Torres and imminent new signing Raphinha. Xavi primarily used him as a right winger last term, and now it remains to be seen whether he slots Raphinha into that position or continues to favour Dembele.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/dembele-barcelona-two-year-deal-pay-cut/blte90c004c2f53758d,Soham Mukherjee,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8071,Barcelona relief as key player has no intention in leaving this summer amid interest from Bayern Munich,"On Wednesday, it was reported that the agent of Ronald Araujo had arrived in Barcelona to hold talks with club officials â it comes amid significant speculation that Bayern Munich want to sign the Uruguayan defender.  Barcelona are very reluctant to sell Araujo this summer despite their well documented financial problems, as they see him as a key player for both now and the future. Within the Catalan club, he is strongly considered as their best defender, and they would much rather sell others â such as Jules Kounde â over Araujo. The meeting heralded good news for Barcelona, as Jijantes FC have reported that Araujoâs agent told Deco that the player intends to see out the remainder of his contract at the very least, meaning that no sale will be considered this summer. Furthermore, discussions were held over a possible new contract for Araujo, something that Barcelona intend to present to the 24-year-old. However, at this stage, thereâs no indications as to whether this is something that will be possible.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Barcelona-relief-as-key-player-has-no-intention-in-leaving-this-summer-amid-interest-from-Bayern-Munich/3301853,,2 days ago,all-football-app
5281,Explained: What is the Premier League transfer deal sheet?,"However, these things are rarely so straightforward, with agents, players and clubs always looking to get the best deal. Indeed, sometimes transfers are not agreed until the last possible minute, which inevitably leads to a frantic scramble from clubs and their administrative staff. Occasionally, late agreements can scupper the completion of a deal, as happened with David de Gea's infamous proposed switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid in 2015. However, a grace period can be granted through the use of 'deal sheets'. GOAL brings you everything you need to know about what they are. The deal sheet is simply a form which is filled out to confirm that negotiations have concluded and that a deal has been reached between the parties. When a transfer deal has been agreed between clubs at the last minute it may not be possible to get every last bit of documentation completed and sent before the deadline. In such cases, it is possible to be granted additional time in order to take care of paperwork by making use of a deal sheet. *An example of a deal sheet can be seen in the above image. The deal sheet can only be used in the two hours before the deadline and it must be received by the league before the deadline passes. After the successful submission of a deal sheet, clubs are granted a further two hours after the deadline in which to get the loose ends tied up. It is slightly different for international transfers, which requires clubs to comply with the Fifa Transfer Matching System deadline of midnight. The process of finalising a transfer concludes with the registration of a player with the league. As part of this, clubs must sent all the documents related to the transfer, such as the following: As you would expect with late deadlines, the Premier League offices are staffed well into the night in order to ensure the swift and efficient handling of the process. A fax machine was once an essential piece of equipment when it came to transfers and, much to the chagrin of those involved in deals, it was responsible for the odd delay. However, we are now living in the age of the internet and the fax machine has been rendered more or less obsolete. Most clubs have embraced 21st century technology and documentation is generally sent via email, with forms being scanned or sent by desktop fax. There are two transfer deadline days in the Premier League, one occurring in the summer and one in the winter. The first deadline day of the 2022-23 season is September, with the window shutting at 11pm BST (6pm ET). The window reopens on January 1 and the second deadline day of the season then takes place on January 31.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/explained-what-premier-league-transfer-deal-sheet/338tzqrjm1dx12ew73hrkvrs0,GOAL,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2375,"'It's a small, cold town' - Neymar warned off Newcastle move by ex-Brazil international Edmundo","Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar has been warned against joining Newcastle by ex-Brazil international Edmundo. The 30-year-old has been linked with a move away from PSG this summer, as GOAL reported in June that the French side are willing to sell him for the right price. Newcastle have been touted as one of the candidates to land the Brazil striker as they look to compete with the Premier League's top teams after they were bought over by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund. Former striker Edmundo believes it would be the wrong move for the attacker, arguing that Neymar would find it difficult to adapt to life in Newcastle. ""Newcastle is the nouveau riche. Now, I've been to Newcastle, it's a small, cold town,"" he said on the podcast Mundo Ed. ""If he has difficulty adapting in Paris, he would not be satisfied in Newcastle. If they pay him what he earns, he goes. ""But he needs to be focused, concentrated, even because it's a World Cup year. If he has an equal performance to the last two World Cups, will the next coach see him as a pillar for the future?"" Asked for his thoughts on Neymar's performances at PSG, Edmundo said: ""It was not a good choice for him to go to PSG. ""It was natural that he would earn what Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo earn, but over time, at Barcelona. ""He understood that he should go to PSG because of the money. The sports project was spectacular, but it was more for the team to show up than to win."" Edmundo believes the Premier League may not be the best division for the ex-Barcelona attacker. Instead, he thinks Serie A would be the right choice for his compatriot, highlighting Napoli as the ideal team for him to join.  ""I played for Napoli for six months, great to live in, beautiful, passionate fans. It would be great, he would do well in Italy,"" he said.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/small-cold-town-neymar-warned-off-newcastle-edmundo/bltb0ced852a17a63be,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

5363,Guardiola tells Man City fans to 'behave' if club win Premier League title,"Pep Guardiola has told Manchester City fans to ""behave"" if they win the Premier League title on Sunday. City are one point clear at the top of the table heading into the final game of the season against Aston Villa. They are the big favourites to secure a victory and retain their title, but recent incidents of pitch invasions across English football have caused some conern that some supporters could cross the boundaries as an intense season comes to an end. Asked about the prospect of fans invading the pitch should City win the title, Guardiola told reporters: ""They have to be careful, what happened at Goodison and Port Vale and other games - the Championship semi-final - a lot of emotions and happiness. ""It is a dangerous situation and we have to try to behave as good as possible. ""Have the celebration at the right moment.

3506,Ndombele returns to Lyon as midfielder signs on loan from Tottenham until end of season,"Lyon have re-signed midfielder Tanguy Ndombele on loan from Tottenham until the end of the season. The France international cost Spurs a club-record £54 million ($74m) when he joined from the Ligue 1 side in the summer of 2019. However he has struggled to live up to that price tag and has returned to his former side in search of regular first-team football. Ndombele's signing was hailed as a coup when the made the move to north London two-and-a-half years ago, as he was considered the kind of energetic box-to-box midfielder Spurs were crying out for. However, the 25-year-old struggled for consistency despite being a regular starter and never earned the full faith of his manager. His first-team opportunities have been limited since Nuno was sacked and replaced by Antonio Conte in November, meaning a January transfer in search of regular action became inevitable. PSG were in talks over a loan move last week but a deal could not be struck, leaving the door open for Lyon to make a move. Peter Bosz's side were keen to bolster their midfield after selling Bruno Guimaraes to Newcastle and will hope a return to familiar surroundings will inspire Ndombele to recapture his best form.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ndombele-lyon-loan-tottenham-end-of-season/blt6f8dede5905b1d74,Tom Mallows,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7773,Carlo Ancelotti addresses major flashpoint of Real Madridâs victory over RB Leipzig â âIâve seen himâ,"Real Madrid are in a strong position to progress to the quarter-finals of this seasonâs Champions League, having defeated RB Leipzig 1-0 in the first leg of their last 16 tie in Germany. However, the scoreline only tells half of the story, in what was a largely disappointing match for Los Blancos.  The hosts had several big chances to score, but Andriy Lunin stood tall to stop everything that came at him. The Ukrainian goalkeeper made nine saves, earning rave reviews in the process. The latest came from his head coach Carlo Ancelotti, who spoke on the 25-year-old after the full time whistle in Leipzig, as per Diario AS. âHeâs a goalkeeper who hasnât had any minutes and heâs progressing. The fact that heâs playing is giving him confidence. I think itâs the best heâs played.â Lunin was unable to stop Benjamin Sesko from scoring inside the opening minutes, although it was ruled out, somewhat controversial. Ancelotti addressed the matter. âIâve seen him offside. He was behind Lunin.â Real Madrid will now look to finish the tie off in three weeksâ time, although there is plenty of La Liga action to be played before then, starting with the trip to managerless Rayo Vallecano this weekend.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Carlo-Ancelotti-addresses-major-flashpoint-of-Real-Madrid%E2%80%99s-victory-over-RB-Leipzig-%E2%80%93-%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99ve-seen-him%E2%80%9D/3301574,,2 days ago,all-football-app
3056,'Hazard should have been the best player in the world' - Cole explains why former Chelsea star hasn't reached Ronaldo & Messi levels,"Joe Cole has explained why Eden Hazard hasn't reached the same levels as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, expressing his belief that the former Chelsea star ""should have been the best player in the world"". Hazard began his career at Lille in 2007 before being snapped up by Chelsea five years later, and quickly established himself as a cult hero at Stamford Bridge. The Belgium international helped the Blues to win six trophies, including two Premier League titles, and scored 110 goals for the club, but has suffered a dramatic fall from grace since moving to Real Madrid in 2019. Cole, who also took in a successful spell at Chelsea between 2003 and 2010, witnessed Hazard's talents up close while he was on loan at Lille for the 2011-12 season. He feels that the winger was at the peak of his powers in 2018 and should have won the Ballon d'Or ahead of Luka Modric, but has also suggested that his mentality has held him back from becoming one of the game's true greats. ""He should have been the best player in the world,” Cole told The Athletic. “That little spell where Luka Modric won the Ballon d’Or – that should have been Eden Hazard. But he lives his life to be happy. To be content. And there’s plenty to be said for that. “He’s a beautiful artist. The best I ever played with. He’s not got the mindset of a Ronaldo or a Messi, and that’s fine. He’s given so much joy to Lille and Chelsea fans over the years and won so many trophies that he should be proud. He achieved it all playing with a smile on his face, enjoying himself."" Hazard has been a shadow of the player he was at Chelsea since arriving at Santiago Bernabeu, failing to live up to his €100 million (£83m/$113m) price tag amid persistent struggles with injury. The 31-year-old has recorded just six goals and 10 assists in 65 games for Madrid to date and has only found the net once so far this season, but Cole says he shouldn't have any regrets over how his career has panned out. “I know Real Madrid hasn’t worked out, but there is no call for regrets,"" he said.  ""He couldn’t have lived a life like Cristiano Ronaldo. You know, ice baths at 1am and all that… that’s not him.  ""If he had, he probably would have won every personal award out there. But Eden did things his way.  ""He’s a family man, and there’s a real balance to be struck in terms of sporting greatness and your life off the pitch.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/hazard-best-player-in-world-cole-explains-former-chelsea/blt16b7e844760c2cd6,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1814,Nigeria’s Iwobi: How tests showed Super Eagle is one of Everton's best runners,"Nigeria international Alex Iwobi has revealed how recent tests conducted on Everton players showed he was the best runner in the team. The former Arsenal winger, who celebrated his 26th birthday on Tuesday, has been one of the leading lights for the Toffees under manager Frank Lampard at Goodison Park. He was in great form playing for the entire 90 minutes as Everton defeated Chelsea 1-0 to keep alive their hopes of avoiding relegation from the Premier League. His recent tireless runs have caught the eyes of many and he has explained a set of blood tests conducted by the whole squad at the beginning of the campaign proved he can be one of the best runners in the squad. ""They [tests] showed I can be one of the best runners in the team. I don't know the specifics, I don't understand the science, and it is something to do with lactate. Doucs [Abdoulaye Doucoure], Andros [Townsend], and I were top,” Iwobi said as quoted by Echo. ""It's weird, it's always been there. I have always been able to run like I am now. There is nothing different about my training. ""I think my teammates knew I had that stamina, especially after the blood tests. Now they are seeing it...'You weren't lying, you can run'. I just say the change of position helped me. ""It is where I grew up playing, I like to get on the half-turn, get the ball forward. I am always trying to play to the attacking players and make something happen. ""When I play infield, I get on the ball more and can take it up the pitch. I told him [Lampard] I'd played there for Arsenal but not had the opportunity at Everton...that it's where I am most comfortable and the position I play for my national team. ""He tried it and it's worked, so far. I felt he was half surprised I could run, he called me a machine.” Iwobi has further explained how Lampard asked him to have tactical awareness after their top-flight game against Leicester City. “The manager spoke to me after Leicester about having a bit more tactical awareness,” he said: “It is nice to have the energy to run and chase and get back, but maybe sometimes preserve it, chill out so you're not burned out.’ “Other than that he says maintain the work ethic because it really helps the crowd engage with the team. Apart from that opening 10-15 minutes against Leicester, when I was literally chasing everything, I have generally got the press right. “The manager knows I have the ability to press and quickly get back into shape.” On managing 90 minutes in recent matches, Iwobi said: “I still can’t help, when I see someone is about to get dragged, thinking, 'Is it going to be number 17?'. In the game, I feel I can run non-stop. “As soon as the final whistle goes, I am shattered and think, 'How have I done that?'. I have been dropping on the pitch, falling on my knees or to the floor. It comes on instantly, the feeling of, 'I am done'. “I have normally been the first one dragged off. Now, the manager has faith in my ability to run for 90 minutes, to give the same level of effort for the whole game. “It is nice when I look over and see it's not my number. I think I have another five or ten minutes, at least, to keep battling for the team, to help us win, or come back for a draw, like against Leicester in the last home game.” Iwobi and Everton will next face Leicester City at King Power Stadium on Sunday.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/nigeria-s-iwobi-how-tests-showed-super-eagle-is-one-of-everton-s-/blt0e8848eb47788bc9,Dennis Mabuka,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

1622,Mane decides to leave Liverpool amid Bayern transfer links,"Sadio Mane is set to inform Liverpool of his desire to leave the club this summer, GOAL can confirm, with Bayern Munich leading the race to sign the Senegal star. The 30-year-old is understood to be ready for a new challenge having spent the last six years on Merseyside, and had hinted before the Champions League final that an announcement on his future was imminent. Mane did not, as promised, speak to the media after Liverpool’s 1-0 defeat to Real Madrid in Paris on Saturday night, but sources have told GOAL that it is increasingly likely he will leave Anfield, and that Bayern are the prime candidates to sign him. Mane, as with Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino, is about to enter the final year of his contract with Liverpool, and negotiations over a new deal were shelved some time ago. The Reds have a good relationship with the player’s representative, Bjorn Bezemer, and had planned to hold talks at the end of the season over Mane’s future. However, growing reports of Bayern’s interest - and an apparent meeting between Bezemer and Hasan Salihamidzic, the German club’s sporting director, have not gone down well at Anfield.  Club sources are understood to be disappointed at the timing of such reports, coming as Liverpool were pursuing glory on multiple fronts. Mane’s form has been strong, but the speculation was viewed as an unwelcome distraction, with Jurgen Klopp issuing a thinly-veiled criticism of Bayern at his pre-Champions League final press conference. At this stage there has been no formal offer from the Bundesliga champions, and Liverpool sources insist that any fee for Mane would be well in excess of the €30million (£25m/$32m) figure that has been widely quoted. Liverpool would also want to have a replacement lined up before selling, with Mane remaining a key figure in the team despite the January signing of Luis Diaz from Porto.  Mane scored 22 goals in all competitions this season, his form particularly strong following his return from the Africa Cup of Nations, where he had helped fire Senegal to glory in Cameroon. News of Mane’s likely exit will naturally concern fans, even if fears over Salah’s immediate future were assuaged last week when the Egyptian stated he would “for sure” be remaining with the club for another year. Mane’s impact since his move from Southampton in 2016 has been huge. He has scored 120 goals in 268 appearances for the Reds, playing in every position across the forward line and winning every major club honour available in that time. Liverpool have already begun building for the future with the capture of Diaz, who has made a fine start to life on Merseyside, but they would need to make another stellar signing if they were to plug the hole left by Mane’s exit. ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mane-decides-to-leave-liverpool-amid-bayern-transfer-links/blt2c351608af7e6508,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
235,Sterling joins the 100 club and is getting back to his brilliant best,"The ""100"" emoji got plenty of use after Manchester City's Premier League victory over Wolves even if it was an easily forgettable game. Ederson claimed his 100th clean sheet in a City shirt but spent the majority of the match 50 yards away from the action; his only meaningful save was a simple tip over deep in injury time to ensure there was no shock result. The other use of the emoji was for Raheem Sterling as he became the 32nd player to score a century of goals in the Premier League and the eighth-youngest after turning 27 on Wednesday. While it’s a milestone earned through his consistency over a long period at Liverpool and City - with only Sergio Aguero scoring more goals for City under Pep Guardiola - from a short-term perspective it underlined how Sterling's confidence is streaming back after a difficult 12 months at club level. His 100th goal wasn’t a spectacular dribble or a long-range shot as he perhaps might have wanted. It was just a simple pass into the back of the net from the spot after a controversial penalty awarded for handball. But the ease with which he rolled the ball into the net, sending Wolves' keeper Jose Sa the wrong way, is a symbol of a Sterling right at his best. “As soon as I saw the referee point to the spot, I picked my place and went with it,” he told BT Sport. “It was really nice to see it go in. Once I’ve got a decision I stick with it and it’s just about the execution.” City’s penalty record in recent years has been patchy, with a third of the last 30 penalties missed including three by Sterling. Just over two years ago he missed from the spot in a 3-2 defeat to Wolves. In fact, he missed it twice after his first was retaken because of VAR. He also missed his next two from the spot against Watford and Brighton. So it was no surprise that there were a few anxious sideways glances among City fans when Sterling put the ball down on the spot on Saturday. After seeing the way he stroked the ball home for his fifth goal in eight games, you wondered what all the fuss was about. “Raheem showed the personality to take it and score the goal and these are the precious values I appreciate,” Guardiola said. “The guys who missed before still take responsibility to do it and this is so important.” It’s a swing back to form for the England international, who had only scored three league goals for the season before kick-off while he struggled to secure a regular placer in the team. It’s led to unhappiness from the winger, who suggested he would consider a move away in search of regular football, and the arrival of £100 million ($133m) man Jack Grealish, who along with academy star Phil Foden can play on the left hand side, has ramped up the pressure on him considerably. With 18 months remaining on his contract, there is the possibility that a decision over his future will have to be taken relatively soon. To see him happy and playing in style is a bonus for the player and club. Guardiola is one to push his players, including Sterling, to strive to get better and throughout his dip form has challenged him to get better. But in recent weeks he’s singled him out for praise and he did so again after looking the most dangerous threat against Wolves. “Raheem has always been important but players have to understand they sometimes drop [form], there are highs and lows in their careers,” Guardiola added. “What we want is the best for them. I am unfair sometimes because they are performing well and they don’t play and I don’t have an excuse to say I’m sorry. “He’s scored lately, he’s so aggressive, he commits players like he’s always done and what he has done has always been incredibly important.” Sterling is heading back into his highest form and with City's goal tally considerably lower than recent seasons, the timing is perfect.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/sterling-joins-the-100-club-and-is-getting-back-to-his-brilliant-/blt7d30d98f713b5e79,Jonathan Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

11914,The Data Day No. 5: Our Rolling Football Blog,"Welcome to The Data Day, our rolling football stats blog for 2021-22, where we try and make sense of what just happened. Yesterday saw the return of the European World Cup qualifiers for Qatar 2022 after a six-month hiatus, but what happened? Luckily for you, we’re here to pick out the key moments with statistical significance so you can pass the knowledge off as your own. NHS: Notorious Heading Skill.111: The total goals that Cristiano Ronaldo has now scored in senior international football. Admittedly this title only works if you’re from the UK or have a familiarity of British healthcare, but it worked for me. The Republic of Ireland were just moments away from a famous win in the Algarve, but a late, late show from Ronaldo saw them come away empty handed. Ronaldo’s first strike saw him overtake Ali Daei’s tally of 109 goals for Iran to become the all-time leading goalscorer in men’s international football. Ronaldo’s second goal in the fifth minute of injury time extended that lead over the Iranian to two goals and meant heartbreak for Ireland. 28 of his 11 goals for Portugal have come from headers (25%), with Ronaldo further confirming that he’s one of the best players ever seen in the air. Ronaldo had seen a first half penalty brilliantly saved by 19-year-old Irish goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu, and it looked like he would have to wait until his next appearance to match Ali Daei’s world record. However, two smashing headers won the game for Portugal and moved them top of their group with 10 points from four games. The Portuguese had the lion’s share of chances in the game but couldn’t find a way through until the 89th minute. 29 shots to Ireland’s six across the whole match, in what you have to say was a deserved win based on the stats. It’s official. France’s 1-1 draw with Bosnia and Herzegovina last night was the most boring match seen in the European World Cup qualifiers for 2022 so far. With goalscoring chances accumulating to just 0.75 xG across the whole match, this game saw the lowest quality shots in the qualifying campaign for the tournament, but somehow still produced two goals. The last World Cup qualifying match in the UEFA zone to produce a lower quality of shots was Greece 0-0 Croatia in November 2017 – an absolute classic encounter featuring 14 shots totalling 0.56 xG. Shoutout to the Greeks for their staunch belief in playing dull qualifiers that year, as only 73 days prior to that draw, they also drew 0-0 with Estonia in a game that had only 0.43 xG in total. There were 15 shots overall, which is actually more than in five qualifiers in this campaign so far, but the quality of those shots left much to be desired. Only six of them came from inside the penalty area, which is another low for this qualification campaign. Altheides. Marcos Baghdatis. Theo Paphitis. Peter Andre. Tulisa from N-Dubz. Your boys took one hell of a beating. Congratulations to Malta for their great 3-0 home victory over Cyprus last night – their first ever World Cup qualifying victory at home. Defender Cain Attard was the hero with a brace – his first two goals for his country, with him now only three goals away from entering the top 10 leading goalscorers in the history of Maltese international football. This was only the third time that Malta have won a World Cup qualifier overall, adding to 1-0 away wins against Estonia in May 1993 and Armenia in June 2013. They already won four points in the 2022 qualifiers, making this their joint-most in a World Cup qualifying campaign – level with their attempts to reach the 1994 World Cup. – MF Following matchday three of the 2021-22 Premier League season, we’ve devised a quick 10 question quiz to test your knowledge. How much attention did you really pay to the action this weekend? – MF Saturday saw both Robert Lewandowski and Ciro Immobile score hat-tricks in league action, but we’ve already covered those performances (scroll down this page). Which other players put in a great shift across the big five European leagues this weekend? We throw some names in the hat. Luis Alberto enjoyed himself in Lazio’s emphatic 6-1 win over Spezia in Serie A on Saturday evening. The Spaniard assisted three goals in the performance, which was more than his entire 2020-21 assist tally (2) set in 34 appearances and the first time that he’s ever assisted three times in his 142-game Serie A career. He attempted 89 passes overall in this win – a tally that he’s only bettered once in his entire Serie A career, nearly two years ago against Parma in September 2019 (101). To top off his night, Alberto scored the final goal on the match in the 85th minute with a brilliant strike from outside the box – his 32nd in the competition. Jack Grealish arrived at Manchester City this summer with a huge price tag above his head, bringing pressure unlike he’d been subjected to before his transfer from Aston Villa. So far, the England international has lived up to the hype and he put in another accomplished display against Arsenal in City’s 5-0 win.Grealish picked up his first assist in a Man City shirt adding to his first goal in last week’s win over Norwich City, while creating six goalscoring chances for his teammates overall. Overall, only Wolves’ Raúl Jiménez (10) has created more chances from open play than Grealish this season, with the former Villa star having the fifth-highest expected assists total (1). In his 90-minute appearance, he misplaced just five of his 68 passes and completed 93% – a rare feat for such a creative player who takes risks with his passes. Grealish will have much harder afternoons in a Manchester City shirt than this one, but it’s been a very encouraging start to his career at the Etihad Stadium. Remember this name. Mohamed Ali-Cho has been impressing many with his bright start to the 2021-22 Ligue 1 campaign following his breakthrough last season at Angers, in which he made 16 appearances in the top-flight. This weekend saw him notch his first goal in top-flight league football in an impressive victory over Rennes and in doing so becoming the youngest player to score in Ligue 1 (17y 222d old) since Eduardo Camavinga in December 2019. Kylian Mbappé had only scored one Ligue 1 goal at this age, so no mean feat by Ali-Cho. Ali-Cho was a constant menace in this match, attempting a game-high six shots and being involved in the opening goal by tackling Rennes’ goalkeeper Alfred Gomis following a comical error. His 88th minute strike arrived after he accelerated past Nayef Aguerd and finished at the second attempt to wrap up the 2-0 win. Ali-Cho was born in Paris but has represented England at youth level. The Three Lions will be hoping he picks them at international level if he keeps these performances up.

Ahead of 2021-22, we asked our pool of Opta data editors across the world to give us some players they thought would make an impact this season. Germany’s Donat Roduner picked out Gregor Kobel following his transfer to Borussia Dortmund from VfB Stuttgart – so far, this looks like a brilliant pick.Kobel was in fantastic form as Dortmund picked up a 3-2 win versus Kobel’s former club Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga on Friday night. Despite conceding two goals (which he could have done little about), the Swiss shot-stopper made three important saves to prevent more, and this eventually helped Erling Haaland’s injury time goal prove to be the winner. Based on our expected goals on target model, the shots that Kobel faced on target in the game against Hoffenheim should have seen the average goalkeeper concede nearly four goals (3.7), but the Dortmund goalkeeper prevented 1.7 with his saves. His performance rightly earned praise at full-time, and it’ll be interesting to see how the rest of 2021-22 shapes up for the 23-year-old. – MF It has begun. At 22:09 local time, Paris Saint-Germain made the substitution of substitutions, bringing on Lionel Messi to replace Neymar. The match situation was calm, as PSG had just doubled their lead at Reims thanks to a second goal on the night from Kylian Mbappe. Were these Mbappe’s final goals for the club on the same night that Messi began his new footballing life in France? We will find that out in the next 48 hours but whatever happens we will at least seen these two generational talents team up together at least once. In Reims. Messi’s cameo was neat and tidy; he barely needed to break into a run for the first 10 minutes or so. On 77 minutes he drove directly towards goal for the first time, playing a pass to Mbappe and almost getting it back but getting a whack in the ear instead. Messi completed 19 of his 20 passes and won four of the five duels he contested, but perhaps the most telling statistic was that no player in the game was fouled more times than PSG’s newest star. In a second half littered with late tackles by both sides, Messi and Mbappe were both seen as legitimate targets by the Reims defence, and Messi will already understand that he is a big prize to any defender up and down France who can tame him, by fair means or not. So in conclusion, PSG are not going to make much money selling DVDs of Lionel Messi’s debut, but, as expected, he looked completely at ease after he came on. Less at ease, though, was the PSG defence, which was fortunate to collect a clean sheet. And as Barcelona can verify, having Lionel Messi in your team doesn’t guarantee you glory if other members of the team are not performing as they should. Sergio Ramos, it’s over to you. -DA  “You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.”Manchester City (the blue pill) can believe in a sixth Premier League title with this hugely impressive and controlled display. Arsenal (the red pill) are far from in wonderland and will be musing how deep this rabbit hole can possibly go; it seems to get deeper and deeper each week. Today marked the 10-year anniversary of Arsenal’s embarrassing 8-2 defeat away at Manchester United. The good news for Arsenal? They lost by only a margin of five goals this time around. The bad news? Well…. Today’s result means Arsenal have lost their opening three games to a top-flight league season for only the fourth time and for the first campaign since 1954-55. It also meant that the Gunners created some history today. Not for the right reasons, of course, as they lost for a ninth successive Premier League game against Man City, setting a new longest-ever run of consecutive defeats against a specific opponent in their league history. The records didn’t end there: Arsenal haven’t failed to score in their opening three matches of a league season since 1953-54.The only other time they have failed to score in their opening three matches was in 1904-05 – their first ever season in the top flight of English football. Scoring goals would be easier if shots were attempted. Arsenal attempted just one in this match – their fewest in a Premier League game on record since 2003-04. That shot was the first in the game on 5:01 from Bukayo Saka, and that was as good as it got. True, Arsenal were 2-0 down and the game was already probably won by City when Granit Xhaka was sent off in the 35th minute of this defeat. But it made the remaining 55 minutes impossible for the Gunners. Since Arsène Wenger left the club at the end of 2017-18, Arsenal have been given 13 red cards in the Premier League, more than any other club. Xhaka himself has been given four in his Premier League career, with no player in the competition having received more since his debut in August 2016 (level with Fernandinho and David Luiz). Since Mikel Arteta’s first game on Boxing Day 2019, Arsenal have won 94 points in the Premier League. That’s the sixth-most and 39 points fewer than the best in this period: Manchester City (135). By the end of this matchday, that tally of points could be overtaken by Leicester City and Everton and equalled by West Ham United. It was clear that Arteta’s brief was to rebuild the club on the pitch, but how long is that project going to be allowed to take? On this evidence, it could take a lot of time, and time isn’t generally something football managers are given a lot of. The international break looms. – MF Where would Lazio be without Ciro Immobile? The Italian international scored his sixth Serie A hat-trick in their 6-1 thrashing of Spezia at the Olimpico to take his league goal tally to 127 for I Biancocelesti. His goals have contributed 35% of Lazio’s Serie A total since 2016-17, proving his importance to the club. Yes, he’s scored a lot of penalties in that total for Lazio – 36 to be precise, but even without these he’d top the scoring charts by 10. All three of his goals in this game versus Spezia came in the first half – and he could even afford to miss a penalty. That spot-kick gave him the chance to complete his treble before the half-time break within injury time, but it was saved by Spezia goalkeeper Jeroen Zoet. Immobile needn’t have worried, as he only had to wait another 28 seconds before nodding in a back-post header from the resulting corner. The last player to score three goals in the first half of a Serie A match was Cristiano Ronaldo for Juventus vs Cagliari in March 2021. Immobile now has eight goals in his last 10 Serie A appearances and has started the 2021-22 campaign with a goal in both matches. He’s finished at top scorer in the competition on three occasions – most recently in 2019-20, and with Romelu Lukaku and Cristiano Ronaldo now out of the picture in Serie A, there’s every chance he’ll go on to pick up his fourth this season. – MF Ciro Immobile wasn’t the only hat-trick scorer across Europe today, with Robert Lewandowski (who else) netting a treble in Bayern Munich’s emphatic 5-0 win over Hertha BSC. Lewandowski’s hat-trick was his 15th in the German top-flight across his 12 seasons in the competition, but he’s still not even halfway to replicating the feats of the legendary Gerd Müller, who netted 32 (THIRTY-TWO!!) in the Bundesliga. These goals also meant that Lewandowski surpassed 300 goals for Bayern in all competitions, with his third of the match taking him to 301 but still miles off Müller’s 563 for the record German champions. His five goals in three Bundesliga appearances this season equals his record at the same stage in his record-breaking 2020-21 campaign, in which he broke the single season goal record (41). There’s every chance he could break it again before his contract expires at the club next summer. Despite being 33 years old – 34 at the start of next season – Lewandowski’s talents will stull surely peak the interests of many of Europe’s top clubs. Since the start of last season, Lewandowski’s 46 goals have come from an expected goals total of 37.1, with the Pole outperforming his xG by more than any other player in the competition (+8.9). Jamal Musiala scored his seventh Bundesliga goal and the first of the season in this rout. Only one player has scored his seventh goal in the competition at an earlier age than Musiala (18y 183d), and that also happened in the Bundesliga today – Floran Wirtz (18y 117d) scoring his seventh German top-flight goal in Bayer Leverkusen’s 4-1 win at Augsburg. This weekend has already seen five goals scored by teenagers in the competition, with Borussia Dortmund’s Jude Bellingham (18y 59d) and Giovanni Reyna (18y 287d) both scoring, as well as Tim Lemperle (19y 204d) of Köln. It’s a good time to be a young player in the Bundesliga, it seems. – MF There are five teams remaining on 100% records in the Premier League as we head in to matchday three, with that total certainly being reduced to a maximum of four following this weekend as Liverpool host Chelsea at Anfield. Both sides have started well defensively, with no goals conceded between the pair, but a 0-0 draw here feels unlikely. Liverpool have fired in the most shots so far in the Premier League this season (46) and have the joint-second highest expected goals total along with Manchester City (4.3), while we all saw the threat that Romelu Lukaku poses following his exceptional second debut for Chelsea at Arsenal last Sunday. Our match predictor thinks Liverpool have the best chance of victory here (48.6%), with home advantage and a raucous Anfield crowd helping play a part. Arsenal kick off the matchday in the early kick off with a daunting away trip to Manchester City. The Gunners have lost each of their last eight league matches against City – their joint-longest run of consecutive defeats against a specific opponent in their league history. Our match predictor gives Man City a higher chance of victory than any other side this weekend, with a 64.6% chance. Arsenal are given just a 13.5% chance of picking up their first Premier League victory over City since December 2015. Brighton have won both of their league matches so far in 2021-22 – they’ve won their first three league games in just three of their previous 94 seasons in the Football League, doing so in 1951-52, 1953-54 and 2011-12. We give them a 34.4% chance of doing it this weekend, but that’s a shade lower than Everton’s chance of an away victory (35.4%) – but with the chances so tight, a draw might prove to be the most likely result in this game. Elsewhere, our match predictor thinks there will be likely wins for Spurs, West Ham and Aston Villa, while Leeds and Manchester United are tipped to pick up away wins on Sunday by the match predictor.

Waking up to check Twitter for Mbappé updates on your phone without turning the light on… pic.twitter.com/dnY6VQ3h1K If Lionel Messi leaving Barcelona wasn’t enough of a shock to the system, the thought of Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé making moves in the same month would have been mind-blowing in the pre-covid football era. We’ve already covered the possibilities for Cristiano Ronaldo in our blog two weeks ago, but that was when we thought a move to Paris Saint-Germain to link up with long-time rival Lionel Messi was most likely. Now it seems like the former Manchester United starlet is to make a heel turn and sign for Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City. If a computer simulation of events in 2011 had revealed that exactly 10 years later, you’d see Ronaldo lining up for a City side led by Pep Guardiola against the French champions containing Lionel Messi then you’d have been forgiven for thinking that there had been a huge glitch in the system – but there’s every possibility that this will happen following their pairing in the Champions League group draw yesterday. Our Qwinn-powered Stats Perform Transfer Portal tool gave us some predicted outputs for Ronaldo should he move clubs this summer, and the move to City didn’t seem to help the Portuguese star’s quest for goal dominance. The simulated metric comparison for 2021-22 league data predicted that he would get much better chances at Juventus (and Paris Saint-Germain) than he would at Manchester City in the Premier League, with Ronaldo’s expected goals per 90 average falling to 0.68 compared to 0.80 in Turin. Ronaldo and Messi are nearing the end of their careers, but two players who look set to at least emulate their goalscoring achievements in years to come are Kylian Mbappé and Erling Haaland. Mbappé looks very likely to leave Paris in the next 12 months, with no desire to extend his contract that runs out next summer. If rumours are believed to be true then this exit could come quicker than expected, with Real Madrid willing to pay a mammoth fee to bring the French international to the Bernabéu a year earlier. His top-flight record is quite frankly ridiculous, with 108 goals at an average of a strike every 97 minute so far in his career. At the same age that Mbappé is today (22 years, 251 days), neither Messi or Ronaldo had got close to scoring as many goals in top-tier league matches, but admittedly the two world football behemoths were playing in deeper-lying roles – more so the case with Ronaldo. Haaland is still a full season and some more away from Mbappé’s current age but still has 73 goals in top-flight league football across Norway, Austria and Germany. There’s every chance he could surpass the French striker’s current goal tally at the same age, having already beaten Messi and Ronaldo’s records – but again, with a caveat of having played some games in weaker leagues than the Premier League and La Liga. Ronaldo (134) and Messi (120) are the only two players with over 100 UEFA Champions League goals, but those tallies look set to be challenged by both Haaland and Mbappé. As the two youngest players to reach 20 goals in Champions League history, both the Norwegian and the French forward are well placed to eventually reach the century – leading UCL goalscorer Ronaldo didn’t reach 20 goals in the competition until he was two months shy of his 25th birthday, after all. Haaland hit 20 goals in just 14 appearances in the Champions League, absolutely smashing the previous record by 10 games. Mbappé has the advantage of experience under his belt, with 45 appearances in Europe’s premiere competition – only Iker Casillas reached his 45th appearance in the competition at a younger age than the wonderkid. It’s all change at the top of the world football pyramid and we’re keeping a close eye on the records set to be broken. – MF",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2021/09/the-data-day-no-5-our-rolling-football-blog/,Duncan Alexander,02/09/2021 2:15,the-analyst
5838,Why does Ziyech not play for Morocco? Chelsea star’s international retirement explained,"Hakim Ziyech's retirement from international football was effective from 2021 and, at the age of 28 it was confirmed that he will no longer represent Morocco. It was certainly a blow for The Atlas Lions to lose the services of a Champions League-winning winger who has shone for both Ajax and Chelsea, but they have already begun to adapt to his absence. It is an unusual move for a footballer to bring the curtain down on their international career, particularly when they are still in their prime years, so why exactly has Ziyech done so and is there a chance the decision could be reversed? GOAL has the details. Ziyech retired from international duty following a dispute with Morocco head coach Vahid Halilhodzic, who criticised the winger's attitude and accused him of feigning injury. Halilhodzic left Ziyech out of a squad in September 2021 and explained his decision to omit the Chelsea star, saying that the player had arrived late and then ""refused to work"". Halilhodzic also accused Ziyech of refusing to play ""on the pretext that he [was] injured"". ""The medical staff made several examinations and said he could play,"" said the Morocco boss. ""He then refused to warm up in the second half because he was disappointed to be a substitute. For me, that type of behaviour is unacceptable. You can't cheat with the national team. You are 100 per cent there or you are not."" Ziyech was later left out of the Morocco squad for Afcon 2021 and Halilhodzic subsequently doubled down on his decision to omit the player, saying: ""I don't select a player who can unbalance the group. Not even if his name is Lionel Messi."" Hakim Ziyech has retired from international football 🇲🇦4️⃣0️⃣ Caps1️⃣7️⃣ Goals pic.twitter.com/GIF6BlWn41 Debut Caps Goals Oct 9, 2015 40 17 Ziyech earned a total of 40 caps for Morocco, scoring 17 goals. He made his debut in 2015 and featured at the 2018 World Cup as well as the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. His last game for Morocco was against Burkina Faso on June 12, 2021. Born in the Netherlands, Ziyech initially represented the Dutch national team at youth level, playing for their Under-19 and Under-21 teams. However, despite being born in the Flevoland town of Dronten, Ziyech was also a Moroccan national and chose to represent the north African country at senior level. A number of other Moroccan players have followed a similar path to Ziyech, with Medhi Benatia representing France at youth level and Munir El Haddadi playing for Spain before switching allegiance. Hakimi + Ziyech = Problems you don't want 🔥pic.twitter.com/PPJlHA32Ca It does not look likely that Ziyech will play for Morocco again, at least not while Halilhodzic is the head coach. The winger gave no indication that he was keen to reverse the situation when asked about it in February 2022, telling ADSportsTV: ""I will not return to the Moroccan national team and this is my final decision."" He added: ""At the end of the day, it's a decision [Halilhodzic] makes and you have to respect it. All the lying that comes with it, it's, for me, clear and I will not return to the national team. ""I understand and feel sorry for [the fans], but that's the situation we're in."" Halilhodzic has been manager of Morocco since 2019 and with no prospect of reconciliation between the pair any time soon, Ziyech will probably have to wait until a new coach takes the reins. As such, it remains possible for Ziyech to play for Morocco again and the country's football fans can take heart from high-profile examples such as Karim Benzema and Roy Keane, both of whom retired early from international football only to return at a later date.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-does-ziyech-not-play-for-morocco-chelsea-star/bltd7f115125cb1c51e,Ryan Kelly,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

5012,Foden finds the magic touch for Man City to break down Simeone's Atletico wall,"Match statistics: Manchester City 1-0 Atletico Madrid According to quantum theory, there is an astronomically small probability that a ball will eventually pass through a brick wall if it is attempted an infinite number of times. And for 70 minutes on Tuesday, Manchester City appeared to be running the experiment live in their Champions League first leg with Atletico Madrid. Diego Simeone brought a new extreme version of 'anti-football' to the Etihad Stadium and for over three-quarters of the match it worked. Enter Phil Foden. Just 79 seconds after stepping off the bench, the England international found the tiniest pocket of space on the edge of the box, turned quickly and then played an instinctive nutmeg pass into Kevin De Bruyne's path to slide the ball past Jan Oblak. All Man City needed was Phil Foden on the pitch 😅80 seconds after coming on he unlocks the Atletico defence to set up Kevin De Bruyne!Big goal in this tie...#UCL pic.twitter.com/rRIXIah2EI Clinical from Kevin De Bruyne on his 50th #UCL appearance. 🎯The ball from Phil Foden, though. 🥶 pic.twitter.com/647s2zqN4U It felt like City had needed absolute precision to find a way through Atletico's packed defence and it was the homegrown star that delivered it. Quite why the 22-year-old had not started was a mystery before the match, and even more so after he caused the Spanish champions more problems in his 20-minute cameo on the pitch than any other City player. It was not quite overthinking from Pep Guardiola to leave Foden out, but it was a decision that potentially made his team's night more difficult. Foden's livewrire movement stretched Atletico's disciplined defence, and he created City's best opportunity from open play of the night when he tricked his way to the touch line and pulled a ball back for De Bruyne, who could not find a way past the four defenders in the six-yard box as he aimed to secure some breathing space ahead of the second leg. A second goal never came, however, and it is difficult to see who the 1-0 scoreline suits better. City have an advantage to take to Madrid and will hope that Atletico will eventually come out to play and leave some room to attack. But Simeone has a platform to approach the game in the same defensive manner for the majority of the second leg and hope to make the most of any opportunities on the counterattack or from set-pieces. The tempo was set in the opening 15 minutes, when City had 92 per cent possession of the ball. And it felt like a good chunk of Atletico's eight per cent was spent waiting for Jan Oblak to take a goal kick. They eventually reached a surprising 29% of possession by full-time, but this was the ultimate show in defensive football. When Antoine Griezmann broke quickly with just one defender alongside him early in the second half, he was still 70 yards from goal with no support, and eventually kicked the ball out for a throw-in when trying to find a team-mate as he ran out of energy. He and fellow forward Joao Felix spent almost as much time defending in their own box as they did in City's half. It produced a heat map that if it were illustrating a person's health would suggest hypothermia from the neck down. It may not have been entertaining, but it was largely effective. City tried to stretch their opponents, but even with Riyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling staying close to their respective touchlines, their time and space was quickly shut down by the breathless Renan Lodi and Sime Vrsaljko. When they went through the middle, there was simply no room for Bernardo Silva or De Bruyne to create any magic. And when they were eventually forced to throw long balls into the box, Stefan Savic, Felipe and Reinildo headed and volleyed it clear from danger. It took a moment of magic from Foden and De Bruyne's fifth goal in as many games to find a way through. After what was the first of four massive games against Atletico and Liverpool in the space of 12 days, it is advantage City in the Champions League - but only just.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/foden-magic-touch-man-city-break-simeone-atletico-wall/blt50ad20b41710491e,Jonathan Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8330,"Jermain Defoe exclusive interview: The hunger that drove him, the impact of Bradley Lowery, and being a manager","“Football was always an escape. When I was playing, I never thought about anything else regardless of what I was going through off the pitch. Then the final whistle goes and all the problems of life comes on top of you. ""I was like that from the age of eight."" Jermain Defoe is discussing his life story, the subject of a new documentary, Defoe, to be released in cinemas for one night only at the end of this month.  It is an unusual mix, blending familiar tropes of sporting success with the tragedy that provided the backdrop to some of his best moments. Defoe is a fan of sporting documentaries, highlighting the recent examples of Ricky Hatton and Ronnie O'Sullivan. But why put his name to one himself? ""I think it is important not only for me but for others to do it because I think you see the person behind the footballer,"" he says. Download the Sky Sports app Read more football features ""It would be nice for people to reflect. See what I have achieved but at the same understand what has gone on away from football. ""There are all these things that people do not know. I do not want people to feel sorry for me, I want them to understand that tough times never last. I just thought it was the right time for people to really understand who I am."" Who he really is might surprise. There are the contradictions. Some, such as the swimming pool he is constructing at his home despite the fact that he does not swim, are trivial. Others are profound. Defoe describes himself as guarded, single-minded, a man with a laser-like focus on football. And yet, few at his level of fame have connected with a young fan as he did with Bradley Lowery. Speaking to Sky Sports in a small room at a private members' club in Soho, this quaint Dickensian retreat amid the hustle and bustle of London life outside feels like the perfect place to explore those contradictions. The discussion is always honest, occasionally enlightening, and briefly intensely emotional when talking about his late father. But let us start at the beginning. Because Defoe has been under pressure right from the start. ""In a crazy way, I think I enjoyed it."" At Senrab, the renowned boys' team in London that produced so many future England internationals, you had to win. By 16, West Ham had paid Charlton £1.6m for him. This is 25 years ago. ""I had not kicked a ball. If we signed a young lad at Tottenham's academy now, without wanting to put too much pressure on, I would naturally be thinking that you have to justify this fee."" Defoe did that, scoring 162 Premier League goals, ninth on the all-time list, and playing 57 times for England. Perhaps the secret was that he never stopped feeling as if he had a point to prove. ""I always felt like I had to be better than the person next to me,"" he says. ""When I speak to my friends now, they always joke about it. They say, 'your mindset was completely different to the rest of us'. They would laugh, 'you never came out. You did not drink. You always stayed behind after training.' But that is just how I was. ""I went to Rangers at the back end of my career where people could maybe understand that I was not the same player as five years before but I always felt like I had something to prove. That is not just games. That is every training session. That is every gym session."" He recalls Tony Carr, West Ham's academy boss, trying to drag him off the pitch. ""I think that came from my background, really. I knew that my family had done so much for me. I just felt like I had to give them something back. I was going to do whatever it takes."" Specifically, he is thinking of his mother. In the documentary, the only time that he becomes visibly tearful is when recalling her job cleaning toilets to help support his own dream. ""There were probably jobs that she never told me about,"" he says now. ""She had me at 18 so it was difficult for her. My mum worked around the clock just to provide but growing up in the East End all I saw around me were people working hard. My nan worked in Tate & Lyle, the sugar factory. My grandad worked in a meat factory."" He describes the events of his grandad's death through his own eyes. ""I got a knock on my door at four in the morning. I went to hospital at five. Got back home at nine. Went to White Hart Lane and played the game. I had to keep going. That was my mentality."" Loss, sadly, has been a theme in his life. Brother Gavin was killed following an assault in 2009. In 2012, he lost his father to cancer. Again, keeping going was the mantra. There were regular trips to the Royal Marsden Hospital in London throughout Euro 2012. Only now, one senses, at 41, is Defoe coming up for air. ""There were things that went on throughout my career,"" he says. ""I probably have this thing where I can blank things out. When I look back now, I don't know how I managed to play or focus and still remain positive. But at the same time you need to be resilient. I felt like I did not have time to be too emotional and sit in a corner and cry."" His relationship with his father was complicated. Curiously, Defoe has not yet seen the documentary, preferring to save it for the premiere at the end of the month. But there is a poignant scene in which an acquaintance of his father relays a tale of how he would speak with such pride about his son's achievements. ""Perhaps he did not tell him that,"" she says. ""But he told everyone else."" When this quote is put to Defoe, he takes some time to compose himself. ""I am getting emotional,"" he says. ""I always knew that he was proud, to be fair. People separate, it happens. It was just me and my mum for a long period of time. I would always see my dad at family parties and stuff but he had his own struggles. He had his own things that he had to deal with. ""Maybe at the time I did not understand it. I knew in his eyes when he spoke to me that he was proud. I knew that he wanted to be there but he had his own struggles and it was difficult. It was always good but it was in passing if that makes sense. ""We never really had the chance to sit down for hours and speak about what went on. I did not have the time to sit down and speak with my dad on a deeper level. [But] I knew."" The documentary discusses the period when Defoe believes he was going to be a father only to have a paternity test and discover that the baby was not his. It puts a different slant on his decision to move to Toronto, his mother saying that he just needed to get away. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  That Bradley entered his world soon after does not feel like a coincidence. Terminally ill with neuroblastoma, the boy wanted his hero in his life. Maybe his hero needed him too. ""It is strange saying it but I just felt like I was prepared for that moment,"" says Defoe. ""But at the same time, how can you prepare for that level of love?"" He adds: ""I am 41 now so I have had experiences where it was difficult to trust people. It does make you paranoid. With Bradley, it was just completely different. From the moment that he jumped on my lap and started speaking, you could just see. It was so genuine."" Bradley died in the summer of 2017, aged six. ""He just wanted to be around me and see me every day. It puts things into perspective. I am only human. I moan about things. But there are families in situations that are really tough. It does change you as a person. But I have so many good memories of Bradley."" In 2024, Defoe is into his second season coaching within the Tottenham academy. He recalls a conversation with Joe Cole, his old pal from the centre of excellence at Lilleshall. ""He told me that I had to become a manager because I was always good with people."" It is working out for the young talent at Tottenham. Keep an eye on 16-year-old Mikey Moore. But it is working out for Defoe too. Still in football. And still with a point to prove? ""Always. Even now when I join in the sessions. I always feel like that,"" he explains. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I still get the same feeling. Not the same as playing. But I do think it is the nearest thing to playing. Being in that coaches office, planning sessions, being around the academy players. I would like to think that in five years I will be a manager. And I will be a good one."" Jermain Defoe's football journey continues. With a twist. ""When I was younger, it was just about goals. When you become older, you realise that football can give you so much more. The impact that you can have on someone's life and they can have on your life. There is so much more. It is not just about kicking a ball.""",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13072314/jermain-defoe-exclusive-interview-the-hunger-that-drove-him-the-impact-of-bradley-lowery-and-being-a-manager,Adam Bate,Publish time not found,skysports
11027,On This Day: Man Utd Confirm Newcastle Failure (5 May 1996),"What happened on this day in football history? Today, we look back on Manchester United pipping Newcastle United to the Premier League title on 5 May 1996. Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson won a record 13 Premier League titles together during an era of brilliance we may never see the like of again. But as broad as their glory was, the 1995-96 crown – which they clinched on this day 27 years ago – is arguably the success that defines their partnership the most. Sure, the 1999 treble was spectacular, and staving off the mega bucks of Chelsea twice in a run of three successive title wins between 2007 and 2009 highlighted Ferguson’s ability to rebuild. But, looking back, 1995-96 came to represent much of what his Man Utd were, and what he was. It certainly wasn’t the case that they were the dominant force all season or anything to that effect. On the contrary. Newcastle United looked near certainties to win the title. Kevin Keegan’s men were 12 points clear – having played the same amount of games (23) – as late as 21 January 1996 and seemingly coasting to glory. As good as Newcastle were, the Red Devils steadily chopped away at their lead in the second half of the season. As the tension rose, the mind games started. Ferguson suggested Leeds United and Nottingham Forest might not try as hard to beat Newcastle as they did the Red Devils, and Keegan famously snapped in an interview with Sky Sports. “When you do that with footballers, like he said about Leeds, and when you do things like that about a man like Stuart Pearce… I’ve kept really quiet, but I’ll tell you something, [Ferguson] went down in my estimation when he said that,” he said. “We have not resorted to that, but I’ll tell you, you can tell him now if you’re watching it, we’re still fighting for this title, and he’s got to go to Middlesbrough and get something, and… and… I’ll tell you, honestly, I will love it if we beat them, love it!” That came after Newcastle beat Leeds, but Keegan’s attempt to heap pressure back on United when talking up the challenge of getting a result at Middlesbrough on the final day of the season didn’t work. United made the breakthrough just 14 minutes in at the Riverside Stadium on 5 May 1996, David May heading in Ryan Giggs’ deep corner delivery at the back post. Substitute Andy Cole then made it 2-0 early in the second half with his first touch, acrobatically turning in from close range after another Giggs corner was deflected into his path. Giggs then put the seal on victory – and the title – nine minutes from time in style, blasting in from 20 yards. “Manchester Utd – Carling Champions” read the banner trailing from a small plane that flew over the stadium. United won their third Premier League in four years, a run that later became four in five. Newcastle’s failure was complete. They’d spent 212 days atop the Premier League table to no avail. It’s still the most time any team has been at the summit for without winning the title. It’s even 23 days longer than Arsenal’s 2002-03 agony – United were the beneficiaries that season, too. Granted, Newcastle’s collapse was already in full motion; their fate all but sealed. Yet, Keegan’s meltdown has become synonymous with the capitulation, emblematic of the Magpies’ inability to handle the pressure. While on the flipside, Ferguson’s knack of getting into his rivals’ heads was plain to see and would become one of the facets most widely associated with the legendary Scot – just ask Rafa Benítez He also did it with a core of promising young players who confounded the doubters. They lost 3-1 to Aston Villa on the opening day of the season, leading to the infamous “you can’t win anything with kids” quote by BBC Match of the Day pundit Alan Hansen. Not only did Ferguson win with those “kids”, he oversaw the greatest points turnaround in Premier League history to win with kids, and it was all sealed in Middlesbrough on 5 May 1996.

4476,"Arteta gave Arsenal 'a shouting and telling off' to inspire win at West Ham, admits Holding","Mikel Arteta gave his Arsenal side “a shouting and telling off” at half-time during a Premier League meeting with West Ham, Rob Holding has revealed, with some harsh truths helping to inspire a much-needed 2-1 victory. The Gunners made the short trip from north to east London for their latest top-flight fixture knowing that three points would allow them to cement a standing inside the Champions League qualification spots. Holding’s first Premier League goal put them on their way, but Jarrod Bowen levelled shortly before the interval to leave Arteta demanding a response that saw Gabriel Magalhaes grab a match winner in the 54th minute. Holding has stopped short of revealing exactly what was said in the Arsenal dressing room against West Ham, but admits that Arteta briefly lost his cool as derby tensions began to rise. The Gunners defender has told Arsenal Media: “We were a bit disappointed to concede that coming in just before half time. “It would have been nice to go in 1-0, but he [Arteta] gave us all a shouting and telling off and we came out and looked more like a team and played how he wanted to play.” Holding helped Arsenal to three welcome points at the London Stadium, with the 26-year-old defender breaking his Premier League goal duck at the 81st time of asking. He has been teased over that record, along with his new hair, and is becoming something of a cult hero to Gunners supporters. They were happy to join in with the fun against West Ham, with those in the stands jokingly calling for a man that played from the start to fill his usual impact role from the bench as Arteta’s men dug deep to secure a narrow success. “Yeah, the fans were calling to bring Rob Holding on, but he was already on!” laughed a man that has started only six top-flight fixtures this season. “It’s what it’s been like, Ben [White] and Gabi have been great all year and when I’ve had to come on and try and help us secure the three points it’s vital for us, so to play the full 90 and get the three points is even better.” Arsenal, who sit fourth in the table with four games left to take in, will be back in Premier League action on Sunday when playing host to relegation-threatened Leeds.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arteta-arsenal-shouting-telling-off-inspire-win-west-ham/bltfc3fa61731b92f08,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8081,Roy Hodgsonâs love for football will see him make swift return â Mikel Arteta,"Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgsonâs love of the game will see him determined to return to the dugout as soon as he is well enough, according to Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta. Hodgson fell ill during training on Thursday and was taken to hospital for further tests, with his condition later being described as âstableâ by the Premier League club. The 76-year-old had been set to speak at a scheduled press conference at 1.30pm on Thursday ahead of the upcoming match at Everton on Monday night, but members of the media waiting outside Palaceâs training ground in New Beckenham were informed the briefing would not take place. Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson (centre) shakes hands with Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta (2nd right)  According to reports, Palace are set to sack Hodgson, with former Eintracht Frankfurt boss Oliver Glasner a strong favourite to take the job. Arsenal beat Palace 5-0 at the Emirates Stadium on January 20, which was the start of a four-game winning streak as they look to keep up the pace in the title race. Arteta wished former England boss Hodgson a swift recovery, and understands what the pressures of the job can bring at both ends of the table. Following news that Roy Hodgson was taken ill during todayâs training session, we can confirm that he is now stable and is currently undergoing tests in hospital. Everybody at the club sends their best wishes to Roy for a speedy recovery. â Crystal Palace F.C. (@CPFC) February 15, 2024 âHopefully, heâs feeling much better and if thatâs the case, knowing Roy, I think he will be in tomorrow because he loves it so much,â the Arsenal manager said at a press conference ahead of Saturdayâs trip to Burnley. âBut yeah, we all got really worried with the situation and hopefully he is fine.â On the stresses managers work under, Arteta added: âThere is that part, but there is the part of joy and how beautiful our jobs are as well. âA lot of times (pressure) is in relation to where you are, but it is part of the job.â Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson (left) and his assistant Ray Lewington  Friday was understood to be a scheduled rest day for the Palace squad ahead of the trip to Merseyside. Ray Lewington and fellow assistant Paddy McCarthy are expected to take charge for the Everton game should Hodgson need any extra time off following his spell in hospital. Palace sit 15th in the table, five points above the relegation zone, heading into the weekendâs Premier League fixtures games. Hodgson took charge of his 200th match as Eagles manager on Monday when his side were beaten 3-1 at Selhurst Park by Chelsea. Former England manager Roy Hodgson  The veteran former England boss is in his second spell in charge of the south London club, having returned for the final 10 games of last season when he signed a short-term deal to take over from the sacked Patrick Vieira. Hodgson guided the club to an 11th-placed finish before agreeing to continue as manager for the 2023-24 campaign. Palace have won just six of 24 league fixtures this term, with only three of those victories coming since a 1-0 success at Manchester United in September. Oliver Glasner during a press conference  Disgruntled fans have displayed banners in recent weeks calling for Hodgson to be sacked and vented frustration with how the club is being run. Austrian Glasner guided Frankfurt to Europa League glory in 2022 following a penalty shoot-out victory over Rangers in Seville. The 49-year-old, who has also managed Wolfsburg, has been out of work since leaving the Bundesliga side last summer.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Roy-Hodgson%E2%80%99s-love-for-football-will-see-him-make-swift-return-%E2%80%93-Mikel-Arteta/3302823,,7 hours ago,all-football-app
1334,The never-ending No.9 race: Should the USMNT keep faith in Ferreira?,"In a position as results-based as a striker, do you get points for trying? Do you get credit for coming close, for nearly doing it? Is there value in having someone that simply creates danger? Can movement, playmaking and chances outweigh a lack of goals? Those are the questions that the USMNT may have to ask themselves in a few months, and those are the questions currently being put forth by young Jesus Ferreira. Through the first two games of this four-game window, Ferreira has certainly created chances. You could easily argue that, with Ferreira up top, the USMNT is at its most dangerous. Aganst Morocco and Uruguay, the 21-year-old FC Dallas star has shown the ability to bring his teammates into the game, drive the ball forward and put defenders on their heels. What he hasn't done, at least so far this window, is score goals. He's come close several times, but the ball hasn't found the back of the net for one reason or another, from big saves to missed opportunities. And so here we sit, wondering if the USMNT can thrive with Ferreira as the potential starter when things get going in Qatar. Can the USMNT win with a striker who probably isn't ready to be your primary goalscorer? ""The main focus as a nine is to score goals,"" Ferreira said, ""but a lot of people have to see that the nine can also assist and can build out and get help out the building. ""I think my job is to facilitate other players to be able to score and to help the other players be in a position to score goals also."" He continued: ""As a forward, it's important to score goals to keep your mindset right. I know that right now I'm going through a little struggle, but if I stay focused and I keep working, the goals will come."" Jesus Ferreira taking his chances early 🇺🇸🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/bSmfAwT2yH To Ferreira's credit, the finishing struggles we've seen so far can be attributed to a few things: big-game jitters, a step up in competition, and international inexperience. All could be factors. And, on the club level, he's certainly finished his chances, as he leads MLS with nine goals so far this season. Internationally, he has three goals from his first 11 caps, including a vital goal agaisnt Panama in the final World Cup qualifying window – a fine haul considering his age a positioning. It's not that Ferreira can't finish, because he absolutely can and has shown he can. He's a good young striker that can definitely find the back of the net. It's just that he hasn't finished in his most recent two games, which just so happen to be two of the last games left before a World Cup. With five months between the U.S. and their flight to Qatar, there isn't that much time to make impressions or add wrinkles to your game. This may very well be the exact version of Ferreira we get in Qatar, but is that version good enough to start? Ferreira, as things stand, is still not quite a pure No.9. He'd primarily been used as a playmaker by FC Dallas before the departure of Ricardo Pepi – a player that, ironically, he's now battling with for the USMNT striker spot. Because of that, Ferreira is probably the best striker in the pool when it comes to creating in the attacking third. Jesùs Ferreira has scored 7️⃣ goals deemed unsaveable by the goalkeeper this season in MLS 🎯@FCDallas | @Jesusfcd27 pic.twitter.com/34CuOHFIWs He clearly understands the needs of Berhalter's system as he frequently finds himself in a position to score. He's not a one-trick pony up top either as he works well with the team's star wingers, which could be invaluable come World Cup time. There's an argument to be made that, even if Ferreira isn't the best goalscorer in the pool, he is the player best equipped to open up space for Christian Pulisic, TIm Weah, Brenden Aaronson and Gio Reyna and, given the talent of those players, might that just be more valuable? Ferreira, by any measure, is very intelligent with his movement despite his young age. He knows when and where to drag defenders and, perhaps most importantly, when to get the hell out of the way and let someone like Pulisic cook. ""The connection, the chemistry, is getting there,"" Ferreira says. ""Every practice, we get better and better. ""I enjoy playing with these guys and I know that every time I can turn, there are runners in behind and even, when I play with Brenden, I know that he can always play those balls in behind. ""There's always an adaptation that I have to have to make as a nine. If I'm playing with Tim, I know that he's always going to be running behind or if I play with Brenden or Christian, I know that they're always going to come inside and play the ball. I have to adapt."" But those chances, the missed chances, are a big strike against Ferreira. In a World Cup setting, goalscorers may only get one or two opportunities to change a game and, ultimately, change a tournament. Those chances may or may not fall to Ferreira but, if they do, will he be ready? Maybe the question is if anyone will be ready. THE FLOODGATES ARE OPEN!@Jesusfcd27 makes it 3-0 for the @USMNT against Panama 🔥 pic.twitter.com/xDiFZStxv2 Haji Wright has shown promise and has scored plenty in Turkey, but he's still only had a few minutes with the senior team so the jury is still out. Josh Sargent hasn't been scoring for Norwich, Daryl Dike has struggled since his initial breakthrough and players like Matthew Hoppe, Jordan Pefok and Gyasi Zardes are probably too far behind to catch up. Then, there's Pepi, a player that, six months ago, was the heir apparent. Perhaps the Augsburg striker comes out on fire for his club this season, finds his footing and plays his way back into the starting role. Barring that, though, the U.S. are looking at a player once deemed to be the goalscorer of the future that hasn't scored any goals in about nine months. Gregg Berhalter has pointed to France's World Cup triumph last cycle, how they didn't need goals from their No.9 to take down all comers. France is obviously a different animal and Ferreira is no Olivier Giroud, but the point may still stand. The U.S. may very well be better off without a pure No.9. They may be better with Ferreira's ability to help the attack flow and create for himself and others. There are still two games this window for Ferreira and Wright to make their mark, even if goals scored against Grenada and El Salvador probably won't count for quite as much as goals against Morocco or Uruguay. But if Ferreira can find just a few goals to add to his game, if he can convert a few of those chances that he's missed over the last week or so, he may very well seize control of the seemingly never-ending No.9 race.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/never-ending-no-9-race-should-usmnt-keep-faith-ferreira/blt42fc0abcfde74664,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8064,Man United 'want Southampton's Jason Wilcox to fulfil key figure at the club',"Manchester United want to bring Southampton director of football Jason Wilcox to the club as part of the INEOS-led revolution, according to reports.  Sir Jim Ratcliffe's 25 per cent stake in the club was approved by the FA earlier in the week as the British billionaire prepares to sanction more board-level changes at Old Trafford. United are currently looking around other English clubs and elsewhere across Europe for top talents to help their sporting restructure and Wilcox is aware of their interest, as reported by The Athletic. Club executives in Manchester hold the 53-year-old in high regard, but are yet to approach Southampton over a deal to secure his exit. The 13-time Premier League champions are moving quick to put together a sporting board capable of returning the club to their former glories during Sir Alex Ferguson's reign.  Majority owners, the Glazer family, have given sporting control over to Ratcliffe and his INEOS group, with the new investor keen to kick-start a new era of success. Newcastle sporting director Dan Ashworth is expected to fulfil the same role at Old Trafford once the two Premier League clubs have come to an agreement.   Manchester City executive Omar Berrada has also been confirmed as United's new CEO and is expected to get started in the position in the summer. Wilcox would report into both Ashworth and Berrada if he was to swap the south coast for the north west and join the ranks at United. Wilcox and Berrada know each other from their time spent together at Man City where the now-Southampton director personnel previously academy director at the Etihad. He left his position to move to Southampton last-year despite the reigning Premier League and Champions League holders making an offer for him to extend his stay.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Man-United-want-Southamptons-Jason-Wilcox-to-fulfil-key-figure-at-the-club/3302233,,1 day ago,all-football-app

455,"'Close the votes, Benzema won it' - Ballon d'Or debate is over, insists Thierry Henry","Karim Benzema has been backed to win this year's Ballon d'Or by Thierry Henry, who says the debate over who should win the award is over following Real Madrid's 14th Champions League triumph. Benzema was one of eight Madrid players to equal Cristiano Ronaldo's record of five Champions League wins on Saturday night as Carlo Ancelotti's side beat Liverpool 1-0 in the 2021-22 final. Vinicius Junior grabbed the only goal at the Stade de France, but Benzema finished as the top scorer in the competition with 15 to his name from 12 appearances, and Henry believes he has been the best player in the world this season. The former Arsenal and France striker says the vote for the 2022 Ballon d'Or winner should already be closed as he insists that Benzema is the standout candidate for the individual prize.         ""I just wanted to say something for France Football or whoever is voting. Close the votes, Benzema won it. Bye,"" Henry said after covering the final for CBS Sports. France head coach Didier Deschamps has also expressed his belief that Benzema deserves to be recognised with the Golden Ball in light of Madrid's latest Champions League triumph. The striker was also Madrid's leading scorer as they clinched the Liga title, with Deschamps saying to Telefoot when asked if he should win the accolade: ""The answer is simple: yes. This new title and the sporting season achieved with his team, and what he was able to do, he was so decisive.  ""Obviously, he was already one of the favourites and he deserves amply this reward."" Benzema doesn't think he could have done any more this season to win the Ballon d'Or, which has been shared 13 times between Lionel Messi and Ronaldo over the past 14 years, with his Madrid team-mate Luka Modric the only other winner during that period. However, the 34-year-old also says that a snub in the voting would not detract from his stellar campaign. “Obviously, I finished my season, now I will join up with the national team,"" Benzema told Canal Plus. ""I think at club level I can't do better. We'll see what happens but in any case I'm proud of what I've achieved.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/close-the-votes-benzema-won-it-ballon-d-or-debate-thierry/blt215bffe70931e89c,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

11912,Introducing Expected Pass Completion (xP),"Passing ability is one of the most important traits to quantify from a performance analysis and recruitment perspective, yet the most commonly used metric, pass completion percentage, is heavily biased by a player’s role more than their ability. For example, a centre back attempting mostly short, sideways passes will usually have a higher pass completion percentage than a winger attempting crosses into the opposition box – but is this enough to say that the centre back is the better passer? Stats Perform’s Expected Pass Completion (xP) framework addresses this issue by considering information about an attempted pass to establish the probability it is completed. In this article we demonstrate how individual xP values reflect pass risk and how aggregating xP values across a game or season show a player or team’s pass difficulty selection. We also introduce a derived metric, Passes Completed Above Expected (PAx), which evaluates player passing skill – how good a player is at completing the passes they attempt given their difficultly. Just as expected goals (xG) predicts the likelihood of a shot being scored, our xP framework models the probability of a pass being completed by taking information about the pass and the current possession. Firstly, we take basic geometric information about the pass: Secondly, we take contextual information about the pass, including: Finally, we utilise contextual information about the events leading up to the pass, such as: Using these features, we train a model to predict the likelihood of a pass being completed or not based on its observed outcome (where 0 = incomplete, 1 = complete). In this way, 0.2 xP represents a high-risk pass (i.e. one predicted to be completed only 1 in 5 times) and 0.8 xP represents a relatively low-risk pass (i.e. predicted to be completed 4 in 5 times).  We can visualise xP values for each individual pass in an example sequence below from Liverpool vs. Manchester United last season. A free kick taken by Thiago marks the start of a possession of relatively easy passes (all above 0.85 xP), which moves up the pitch towards the right wing before switching flanks via three quick passes and finally ending after a more difficult cross by Andrew Robertson (0.41 xP) goes unsuccessfully out of play (we show an example of quantitative explanations for two of these predictions in the Appendix at the end of the article). As with xG, we may be less interested in analysing the values of individual actions using this metric – small sample sizes are noisy and not necessarily representative of a player’s true performance – and instead prefer to aggregate xP at different levels: average per player per game, average per team per season, and so on. If we take the mean xP per pass of all players with 2,000 minutes played in the Premier League in 2020-21, we see Ruben Dias attempts the lowest risk passes (0.92 xP) whilst Nick Pope attempts the highest risk passes (0.45 xP). These values can help quantify the different roles these players fulfil; for instance, Dias mainly plays safe passes in a very high Manchester City back line where losing possession could be catastrophic, whereas Pope often plays direct, long balls upfield for Burnley to contest with aerial duels. xP only tell us the average difficulty of attempted passes but not necessarily how skilled a player is at completing them. By subtracting the predicted pass outcome (xP) from the observed pass outcome (where 0 = incomplete, 1 = complete), we can estimate how much better or worse than expected a player is at completing the passes they attempt. We call this measure PAx, which can also be thought of as ‘passes completed above expected’. For example, a difficult pass (0.2 xP) which is completed (outcome = 1) is scored: [Outcome – xP = PAx] 1 – 0.2 = 0.8 PAx Whilst an easy pass (0.8 xP) which is not completed (outcome = 0) receives a negative score of: 0 – 0.8 = -0.8 PAx We can easily sum this score per team or per player across a game or a season. For example, if Player A attempts 1000 passes in a season with a total of 750 xP and completes 800 of them, they receive a score of: 800 – 750 = 50 PAx However, if another player, Player B, attempts 2000 passes with a total of 1750 xP and completes 1800 of them, they receive the same total score as Player A (1800 – 1750 = 50 PAx) despite playing 1000 more passes. We can make this metric fairer by normalising it and instead calculating PAx per pass. Now, Player A has a normalised PAx score of: (800 – 750) / 1000 = 0.050 PAx per pass Whilst player B has: (1800 – 1750) / 2000 = 0.025 PAx per pass Normalising like this usually yields a low magnitude value, so we may better express the metric per 100 passes, i.e. Player A has 5 PAx per 100 passes – in other words, they complete 5 more passes per 100 than expected. Looking again at Premier League players with 2000+ minutes in 2020-21, Jack Grealish had one of the highest normalised PAx scores (7.8 PAx per 100 passes) whilst Richarlison had one of the lowest scores (-2.4 PAx per 100 passes). In other words, for every 100 passes that Jack Grealish made last season, he completed almost eight more than the average player would be expected to, whilst Richarlison completed almost two fewer than expected. We can visualise this difference by comparing individual passes of interest between these two players below, where only high-skill passes above 0.5 PAx (i.e. difficult passes below 0.5 xP which are completed) are shown in blue and low-skill passes below -0.8 PAx (i.e. easy passes above 0.8 xP which are not completed) are shown in red. We combine xP with our other AI models – such as Possession Value (PV), Movement Chains, and Pressure – in the Stats Perform Edge Analysis platform to quickly find specific patterns of play and link to video of them. For instance, the example below shows clusters of Movement Chains by Liverpool in 2019-20 in which the average pass was relatively safe (over 0.5 xP) and relatively threatening (medium to high xPV). We can select individual clusters and drill down into the Movement Chains to see, for example, a set of moves satisfying these criteria which start centrally just outside the Liverpool box and move down the left wing before finishing (in a cross, a shot, a dispossession, etc.) just to the left of the opposition box. Now that we can quantify the difficulty of passes, we can value a player’s passing ability with more context. Two players may have the same pass completion percentage but xP enables us to measure how difficult their underlying passes were, whilst PAx allows us to quantify how skilled they were at completing those passes. By combining xP and PAx with our other advanced metrics, we can build out more sophisticated pass risk-reward-skill profiles for performance analysis and recruitment. We can get an explanation of how complex models like our xP framework arrive at their decisions using SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) plots. These show the importance of each model feature in terms of positively (blue) or negatively (red) influencing any given predicted xP value. For example, the SHAP plot for Nat Phillips’ 0.95 xP pass in the sequence above shows that the relatively forward angle (angle = 147.5, where 180° is a forwards pass and 0° is a backwards pass) slightly increases the risk of an unsuccessful pass. However, the fact that the ball was played from relatively deep and centre (x = 40, y_abs = 5), was a ground pass (lofted = 0), and came after a relatively regressive passage of play (vertical_progress_speed = -2.521; i.e. Thiago’s free kick moved the ball away from the opposition goal) all greatly increase the predicted likelihood of completion. On the other hand, for Andrew Robertson’s 0.41 xP pass, the SHAP plot shows that being a cross (cross = 1) and being played deep into the final third (x = 91) greatly decrease the predicted probability of pass completion, although the fact that it’s a relatively square (as opposed to from deep) ball (angle = 99.82) and that the previous pass was relatively long (prev_pass_dist = 17.72) reduce the risk of failure slightly.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2021/09/expected-pass-completion-explained/,Joe Gallagher,08/09/2021 8:05,the-analyst

6453,Rudiger reveals support for Afcon hopefuls Sierra Leone after funding operations for local children,"Antonio Rudiger has revealed he is supporting Sierra Leone in their African Cup of Nations (Afcon) campaign in a bid to remain connected to his parents' home country. His mother Lily was forced to flee Sierra Leone after the civil war in 1991 and had her child in Germany, where she subsequently settled. Growing up in the new Neukolln area of Berlin, the Germany international has become one of the best defenders in the world. Still, he remains connected to his roots through football and his charity work. ""Of course, I'm cheering on Sierra Leone from London,"" Rudiger told GOAL. ""I am in regular contact with one or two of the players through Instagram. I actually get on very well with Kei Kamara. ""I think the team's mentality is really outstanding. They are all amazing characters who are going all in every game. The 0-0 against Algeria alone was a huge success - they can only win in the next few games as well. ""They defended incredibly well and have a world-class goalkeeper in Mohamed Kamara. Luckily the boys don't play again until Sunday, so I can watch it all on TV again after our game against Manchester City."" Rudiger is involved with children's aid organisation BigShoe in Lunsar. In recent weeks, Rudiger has enabled children with club feet to be treated through costly but life-changing operations. Symbolically he has helped eleven kids, the number of players in a football team. Alongside that, he has sent each one a Chelsea shirt with the name Rudiger on the back. He said: ""Every child has dreams, but not all of them have the opportunity to pursue them - I want to change that! ""Through football, I have been given the opportunity to help others and make the lives of these children and their families better. Seeing the children smiling in the photos also makes me happy. ""I am very connected to my second home. We have more projects planned. My first visit to Sierra Leone five years ago taught me above all that everything that we supposedly call a 'problem' here in Europe is not really a problem at all.""

5752,Martial didn't want to be part of Man Utd squad - Rangnick,"Ralf Rangnick says Anthony Martial asked not to be included in the Manchester United squad to face Aston Villa on Saturday, however the player has denied that claim. The France international was absent from the team as the Red Devils took home a 2-2 draw from the Premier League clash at Villa Park. Rangnick, who said in December that the 26-year-old has asked to leave the club, was ready to include Martial in the squad this week.  ""He didn't want to be in the squad,"" Rangnick told reporters after the match.  ""He would have been in the squad normally, but he didn't want to. That's the reason he was not travelling with us yesterday."" Martial later denied he refused to play via his Instagram story. ""I will never refuse to play a match for Man United,"" he wrote. ""I've been here for 7 years and I never disrespected and will never disrespect the club and the fans."" The former Monaco attacker was the subject of a loan bid from Sevilla last month, but United turned the offer down. The Old Trafford outfit will only let him leave on loan if the buying club offers a fee and agrees to cover his wages. Martial has also recently been linked with Juventus, with reports claiming the Serie A side are plotting a loan bid. The centre-forward has made just 10 appearances in all competitions this season.

The Gunners are looking to strengthen their attack with the capture of a new forward in the upcoming transfer window and the Argentina international is reported to be one of their main targets. Atletico Madrid have also been linked to the 24-year-old, but now his representative, Alejandro Camano, says he is not considering a move away from San Siro. Camano said on Radio Colonia: “We are not depending on a transfer, he is at Inter, he is happy, the city is wonderful. ""Sometimes the press publishes things about a transfer but Lautaro is thinking about Inter, giving the people of Inter joy, becoming champions and working for the World Cup.""

5573,"Carlos Alcaraz: Why are Arsenal, Tottenham and Inter tracking the €25m Argentine teenager?","The most important game yet of Fernando Gago's fledgling coaching career ultimately ended in cruel disappointment. Having dominated over the 90 minutes on Saturday, Gago's Racing Club side went down on penalties in the Copa Superliga semi-finals against his old club Boca Juniors, not only going out of the league play-off competition unbeaten over the entire tournament, but also losing out to their rivals having prevented them from recording a single shot on target. Despite that setback, Racing and their young boss are in fine fettle, having bounced back from an underwhelming 2021 campaign to re-establish themselves among Argentina's top clubs. Perhaps the ex-Real Madrid and Argnetina midfielder's most notable achievement has been to get the best out of every one of his players, and for nobody is that more true than Racing's new sensation, the explosive teenage talent Carlos Alcaraz. A native of La Plata, Buenos Aires, Alcaraz came to La Academia's attention during an Under-15 friendly encounter representing his city, and was immediately offered the chance to join their youth set-up. He has been around the first team for some time now, making his debut back in 2020 and notching his first senior goal against Union in November of that year, two days before celebrating his 18th birthday. But despite his clear ability, the youngster struggled to make much of an impression in a faltering side, looking unsure about what his role on the field was as he was shuttled to and forth between the middle of the pitch and attack. Gago's arrival at the tail-end of 2021, the third coach to sit on the Racing bench in the space of 10 months after Juan Antonio Pizzi and Claudio Ubeda came up short, would clear up much of that mystery. Alcaraz was installed as the most advanced member of a dynamic three-man midfield and given complete license to push forward into the penalty area, while at the same time required to form part of Racing's suffocating high press. It is a position in which he has thrived, catching the eyes of Tottenham, Arsenal and Wolves in the Premier League, as well as Inter and AC Milan over in Italy, all of whom may well be in the chase for his services once the summer transfer window opens. The youngster represents decent value, too: while his release clause is set at €25 million, any bid approaching €20m would likely to be too attractive to refuse for his current employers. “Carlos gives us great hope. But he has to keep learning and building his career,” Gago, who knows a thing or two about the pressure of being a teenage prodigy having clinched a €20 million move from Boca to Madrid at the tender age of 20, told reporters earlier this year. “As a person, physically and as a footballer. There is a whole team behind him supporting and helping.” Alcaraz gave an exhibition of his talents to send Racing into the semis at the expense of Aldosivi last Tuesday. Both of the team's opening goals came courtesy of the 19-year-old and his frequent late arrivals into the box: the first, a header at the far post; then, minutes later, he peeled away from his marker just in time to receive Tomas Chancalay's low cross and drilled the ball into the net, setting the tone for an emphatic 5-0 victory with Wolves scouts reportedly watching from the Cilindro stands. That double took the youngster up to five goals in just 17 matches for the season, and he almost opened the scoring in Saturday's semi too with a decent headed effort stopped by Boca keeper Agustin Rossi. It is an encouraging sign for a player already standing out for his powerful, direct dribbling and prowess from free-kicks – a particular Alcaraz speciality is to sneak the ball in at the near post, a technique that worked like a charm in the Copa Sudamericana against Cuiaba. 🎥🇦🇷🔥 The best moment as @RacingClub made it back-to-back wins with a 2⃣-0⃣ defeat of @CuiabaEC! pic.twitter.com/gji7VfB6nG For Racing president Victor Blanco, Alcaraz could well go on to emulate another former member of the club's academy who is pulling up trees in Europe and with the national team. “Could he reach Lautaro Martinez's level? He is a great player, who debuted in the first team at 17. There is a great chance,” Blanco indicated in an interview with FCInterNews, while also suggesting that the strong relationship cultivated between the two clubs via the arrival of Martinez and through their shared idol Diego Milito could help the Nerazzurri get their man: “That aspect always helps when it comes to negotiating.” For now, Racing will hope Alcaraz can continue his fine form in the Copa Sudamericana, where on Wednesday La Academia meet Peru's Melgar in a match they must win to stay on course for first place in their group and a spot in the last 16. But if he continues on this dazzling path it will not be long before the teenager is bidding farewell to Gago and his current team-mates, and embarking on a new adventure with one of Europe's top clubs.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/carlos-alcaraz-arsenal-tottenham-inter-argentine-teenager/blte617db2ef01b79c2,Daniel Edwards,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5261,Man City away kit for 2022-23 puts modern twist on classic designs from 1960s & 70s,"Manchester City have released their away kit for 2022-23, with the reigning Premier League champions working in partnership with PUMA to put a modern twist on a classic design from the 1960s and 70s. The current kings of England have offered a nod towards legendary trophy-winning sides from the club’s past. They will be hoping that a fresh look helps to inspire superstars of the present to add more medals to their respective collections in the upcoming campaign. City have often favoured red and black stripes on their travels down the years, with the latest design also conjuring up memories of their first Premier League title triumph from a decade ago. Sergio Aguero, David Silva and Vincent Kompany were the stars of the show back then, with the likes of Erling Haaland, Kevin De Bruyne and Jack Grealish helping to ensure that major silverware continues to be collected on a regular basis in the present. City have said of their kit: “The new strip, which features diagonal red and black stripes, is inspired by the shirt worn during a golden period in which we won the 1969 FA Cup and the 1970 League Cup and European Cup Winners’ Cup. “That kit, which was conceived by the legendary Malcolm Allison, featured red and black vertical stripes and earned iconic status after being worn in the final of all three of those memorable triumphs. “PUMA have now reinvented that classic shirt for Pep Guardiola’s side.” The Manchester City 2022-23 away kit is available to buy right now from PUMA and the Man City online shop.

3757,From title glory to a £26m divorce: Inside Conte's tumultuous Chelsea tenure,"Chelsea’s relationship with Antonio Conte ended in court and ultimately cost the Blues £26.6 million ($36m), making it the most costly divorce in football history. When the Blues sacked the Italian in 2018, they argued that he was not entitled to the usual severance package because of alleged breaches of contract during his second and final year at Stamford Bridge. The judges ruled in Conte's favour, though, and he split the compensation received with his 11 staff members. It was a shame that the coach's time in west London had ended in such acrimony, and surprising too, given it had started so promisingly. Indeed, in his first year in charge, Conte transformed a side that had finished 10th the season before into Premier League champions. A switch to a 3-4-3 formation, which hadn’t often been seen in England, sparked a 13-game winning run that led to his side romping to the title. The Blues went close to pulling off a domestic double in 2017 but they were beaten in the FA Cup final by Arsenal. However, they would return to Wembley the following year to lift the trophy following a 1-0 victory over Manchester United. Two major trophies in two seasons would normally guarantee at least another year at the helm for a manager but Conte's tenure had already began to unravel before the end of the 2017-18 campaign. The first signs of tension at Stamford Bridge actually appeared during the 2017 January transfer window, after Diego Costa pushed for a £25m ($34m) move to Chinese Super League club Tianjin Quanjian. The Blues forced the Brazil-born Spain international to stay put and he played a key role in their subsequent title triumph. However, Conte then informed Costa that he was not part of his future plans via text message while the striker was on holiday. Costa was furious and partook in several interviews where he claimed he had been ""treated like a dog"". Inside the club, many blamed Conte for his insensitive handling of the situation and believed he should have let club director Marina Granovskaia deal with Costa's exit. Nonetheless, after their title success, which secured a return to the Champions League, Chelsea sought to strengthen a squad that Conte did not believe was sufficiently equipped to challenge for trophies in both England and Europe. The Blues brought in several players but not necessarily all of those on Conte's ambitious wishlist. Having already been left disappointed by seeing top target Virgil van Dijk leave Southampton for Liverpool for a then-record fee for a defender (£75m/$101m), Conte was further frustrated by missing out on Leonardo Bonucci, who left Juventus for AC Milan in the summer of 2017. Conte was also keen on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Romelu Lukaku and Kyle Walker, while the Blues also had an significant bid turned down for AC Milan’s Alessio Romagnoli and even approached Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski during the Lecce native's time at the club. However, for the 2017-18 campaign, Chelsea had instead brought in Alvaro Morata, Tiemoue Bakayoko, Danny Drinkwater and Davide Zappacosta in what many believe to be the club’s most disastrous transfer window in recent times. Unsurprisingly, Chelsea were quickly left behind by Manchester City in the title race and, in November, influential technical director Michael Emenalo left the club by mutual consent, which was hugely significant, as it meant that the mediator between Conte and Granovskaia was removed from the equation. What followed, almost inevitably, was a series of bitter and depressing press conferences in which Conte publicly expressed his unhappiness with Chelsea's transfer business. Chelsea are still counting the cost of the 2017-18 campaign to this day, as the January arrivals of Olivier Giroud, Emerson Palmieri and Ross Barkley took their overall outlay that season to £234m ($315m). The Blues did still lift the FA Cup but they finished fifth in the Premier League, which saw them fall back out of the Champions League. It quickly became clear during the summer that followed that Chlesea wanted to bring in Maurizio Sarri as their new manager but his arrival was held up by Napoli's ultimately successful attempt to make the £57m ($77m) signing of Jorginho part of the deal. As it was, though, Conte was actually forced to take the first three training sessions of the new season as he awaited his fate. He arguably deserved better but, looking back at the whole affair, it would be unfair to portray either side as a hero or villain. It was just another dramatic episode in the turbulent world of Chelsea, who have forked out around £100m ($136m) in severance pay to sacked managers since Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2003. Conte, for his part, has always been reluctant to shed much light on his Chelsea tenure. ""I spent two seasons where I created a good relationship with players, staff, people who work at Chelsea,"" the now-Tottenham coach said ahead of the first of three meetings with his former employers this month. “We did a really good job and I think in my position I don't have to prove anything to anyone. ""I’m a manager that has the experience to do important jobs at other teams and it’ll be a pleasure for me to come back to Stamford Bridge.” Many Chelsea fans have fond memories of Conte's time in charge too. He was often warm and engaging whenever he met supporters out and about in London, and he grew to love English football after struggling to even speak the language when he first arrived. When Chelsea sealed a 3-0 aggregate win over Spurs in the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup with a 1-0 victory at the Tottenham last week, those in the away end sang “Antonio, Antonio, Antonio!"" It wasn’t an ironic dig at Conte or his side. Of course, it is easier to profess love from a position of strength but there is still a genuine affection there for their former manager. Chelsea fans identified with Conte’s passion, work ethic and intensity. The Blues may have long since moved on but there remains a significant amount of respect for the so-often divisive figure who will take a seat in the away dugout at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/from-title-glory-to-bitter-divorce-conte-chelsea-tenure/bltf29875efd62af620,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Arnold admitted that the club has spent almost ""a billion pounds"" without seeing results during a meeting with supporters in Cheshire.  But he did give a strong endorsement of Frenkie de Jong, supposedly United's next big target.   “We spent a billion pounds on players. We have spent more than anyone in Europe,"" Arnold fired. “I’m not thrilled where we are. It doesn’t sit easy with me and I worry how we get this sorted for the future.

I’m not here to defend (chairman) Joel (Glazer). He must speak for himself. “But you have taken the time to come here and make your views known - and I respect that. We’ve blown through an enormous amount of money. “For this summer, the money manager and director of football (John Murtough) wants is there. For the future, for investing in a new stadium and a latest-and-greatest training ground we’ve got to do something. We’ve got to get investors in. “I need that to do what I want for the club. I’ve got to have more cash now because no club in the world has the money to build a new stadium. You either borrow it or invest it. The money has got to come from somewhere. “You might not like our current owners - I can’t help that. But if you want someone else to come in they will see that the fans love the team and that is positive. “But last year was a f***ing nightmare. There was hate at every game.” Barcelona star De Jong has been strongly tipped to join compatriot Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford this term. And Arnold called on supporters to trust the new boss' judgement on the midfielder.  ""Money is not a consideration on who we want. The manager wants him (De Jong) and they have actually done the work. He's a great player,"" he added. ""Is it 100 or 200 [million]? I don't know. Get who you f*cking want.

The repercussions for John McGinn and Ezri Konsa, who lost their footing before conceding a goal against Wolves, were not as serious as they were for their manager, but they still contributed to a derby defeat against West Midlands rivals.

If he plays like this consistently he would win the Ballon d'Or easily. The Brazilian scored a golazo and had a hand in three of Madrid's 4 goals on the night. Vini proved too good for Cuoto and the rest of that Girona backline. Bellingham - 9 For 65 minutes, the Englishman bossed the game from midfield and scored twice to extend his lead as the league's top scorer. Unfortunately, his fine performance was cut short by an ankle injury. Hopefully, that's not too serious.Camavinga - 8.5 The Frenchman was superb in midfield today for Real Madrid. It was his pass that started Madrid's scoring spree with Vinicius taking advantage. Camavinga was a calming influence in that midfield, winning tackles breaking the play and creating some chances.

2775,Salah contract ‘threat’ at Liverpool addressed by Reds legend Fowler as questions asked of ‘calculations’,"Mohamed Salah saying he will be at Liverpool next season regardless of what happens on the contract front “was clearly a threat”, says Robbie Fowler, with a Reds legend asking questions of the “calculations” being run at Anfield. Discussions regarding fresh terms for a talismanic presence have dragged on for some time, but no paperwork has been signed and a three-time Golden Boot winner could work his way towards free agency in 2023. Efforts are being made to prevent such an occurrence from happening – especially as Sadio Mane has already departed for Bayern Munich – but Fowler believes more needs to be done in order to convince Salah that his standing among the global elite is being recognised. Fowler, who took in two spells at Anfield during his playing days and was affectionately known as ‘God’ by Reds supporters, has told The Mirror of a long-running Salah saga on Merseyside: “I won’t pretend to know what’s going on with his contract, but clearly the answer is: nothing much. And that leaves so many questions unanswered.  ""One thing is obvious, the club has done some very clear, precise and unemotional calculations with Mane. He’s 31 in April, has a huge amount of running in his legs, and wanted a huge contract as one of the best players in the world. “I don’t blame him for that. Mane is the equal of virtually every world class star at the moment, and rightly wanted that recognition with the going rate for the last big contract of his career. ""What Liverpool so obviously did though, was run their analytics - which to their credit they do so well - and decided selling him to buy Darwin Nunez and keep their wage structure in place was the right thing for the club. It begs the question, what calculations have they run on Salah? “Again, I don’t know all the answers, but what screams out to me so clearly, is they won’t be breaking their wage structure to keep him. If they were prepared to do that, it would have happened by now. But look, I can’t blame Salah for wanting the going rate, just like Mane did. He’s the Premier League Golden Boot winner, he’s the Footballer of the Year and in with a great shout of the Ballon d’Or top three. “What salary does a player in the top three in the world command? He obviously believes it’s more than Liverpool are offering. But if my old club are running complex calculations, then so too is Salah - and it can never be a precise science. I think him saying no matter what happens with his contract, he’ll be at Anfield next year was clearly a threat.” The 30-year-old forward has been a revelation for Liverpool since completing a transfer from Roma during the summer window of 2017. He hit 44 goals in his debut campaign, which resulted in him landing the first of his Golden Boots and PFA Player of the Year awards. Salah is now up to 156 efforts for the Reds through 254 appearances and is a Champions League and Premier League title winner. He has been a model of consistency for Jurgen Klopp’s side, allowing a standing among the best in the world to be established, but speculation regarding his future has now raged for some time. There have been various reports speculating on the terms tabled by Liverpool, but it is yet to be determined whether a compromise will be reached that allows a modern day Reds legend to remain in his current surroundings.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/salah-liverpool-contract-threat-addressed-by-reds-legend/bltce89be552565d462,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8461,Cardiff City 0-2 Preston North End: Emil Riis scores first goal since October 2022 in Lilywhites win,"Preston moved to within two points of the Sky Bet Championship's top six courtesy of a 2-0 win at Cardiff. Emil Riis scored his first goal since October 2022 in the 30th minute before Ben Whiteman struck his third of the campaign to double the away side's lead 10 minutes later. Cardiff struggled to create clear-cut openings and have now lost three home games in succession, while Preston stretched their unbeaten run to three outings. Erol Bulut handed full debuts to former Celtic midfielder David Turnbull and Liverpool loanee Nat Phillips while Ryan Lowe stuck with the same 11 that started Preston's 3-2 success against Ipswich last time out. The Bluebirds started on the front foot and saw Kion Etete and Karlan Grant both drill efforts straight at home goalkeeper Freddie Woodman. The Lilywhites struggled to get into the contest as Cardiff played with more composure and accuracy, with Grant again testing Woodman. But Preston stunned the home crowd by taking the lead with what was their first effort on target on the half hour mark. Live Championship table Championship fixtures Stream the Championship on NOW Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp Riis cut in from the left flank, evading challenges from Dimitrios Goutas and Manolis Siopis, before firing past Jak Alnwick. It was the Danish forward's first goal since returning from a year on the sidelines due to an ACL injury, and one that allowed Preston to gain a foothold in the game for the first time. The outlook of the match completely shifted, so much so that Bulut was yellow carded by referee Dean Whitestone as the frustration among those in blue grew. It got even better for Preston five minutes before the break as Brad Potts, Will Keane and Mads Frokjaer-Jensen combined on the right and the latter teed up Whiteman, who slotted home to round off a stunning team move. Home fans jeered as the half-time whistle blew and Bulut replaced Ryan Wintle and Josh Bowler with Aaron Ramsey and Josh Wilson-Esbrand for the second half. It was Ramsey's first appearance since suffering a knee injury against Swansea in mid-September, while it was Wilson-Esbrand's maiden home outing for Cardiff since joining on loan from Manchester City. Phillips and Siopis both had efforts shortly after the restart as the Bluebirds looked to reduce Preston's deficit, with Grant then lashing over following a one-two with Ramsey. Famara Diedhiou replaced Etete to make his home bow, although Alnwick did brilliantly to keep Cardiff in the game by palming away Riis' strike. Rubin Colwill and Yakou Meite were both summoned from the bench but Preston managed the final stages with minimal fuss to end their five-game winless away streak, leaving Cardiff seven points adrift of the play-off places in the process. Cardiff's Erol Bulut: ""We need patience, all of us. We've got new players, four or five new players. ""We try to get them adapted to the team quickly. I thought Nat was quite good, Wilson came in, but they have to know their team-mates much better and their movements. ""This will come over the next few games. We have many games in the next few weeks and we have to show it. ""We have to continue to show them what they need to do. I hope the next few games will be much better."" Preston's Ryan Lowe: ""We've all been waiting for Emil to come back. He looked strong physically, I'm pleased with his goal, for him and his team-mates, they're all pleased for him. ""The build-up to it was fantastic and the way he took it, so I'm really pleased for him. It's huge to have him back. ""At some point he's going to have to have a break. We're just trying to mould him into a perfect striker. But we do need to be careful with him. ""We can't just slog him all the way through, we'll manage his days and his loads. ""I'm just pleased for him getting on the scoresheet today after having that long period of time out, as a striker it's pleasing.""

8248,De Jong could leave Barcelona despite being left 'very upset' by Man Utd saga,"Barcelona are mulling over whether or not to sell Frenkie de Jong in the summer amid interest in the midfielder from Manchester United.  The Dutch playmaker, 26, was heavily linked with a move to the Red Devils back in the summer of 2022 and it was even outlined at the time that United had agreed the framework of a deal worth Â£70million with Barcelona for De Jong's services. De Jong decided to snub interest from the Premier League giants at the time in order to stay at Barcelona - but it seems as though the Spanish champions could attempt to cash in on the former Ajax star for a second time at the end of the season. According to a new report Relevo, the Barcelona hierarchy 'have doubts' over De Jong and a summer sale has not be ruled out as the club strive to improve their financial health. While Barcelona were open to doing business with Manchester United last summer, De Jong never seemed to be on board with a move to the Premier League. Erik ten Hag quickly installed De Jong as his primary transfer target after working with the player at Ajax and it's understood that the Dutchman's interest in his compatriot still stands. Spanish outlet Sport reported back in October that the saga - which rumbled on all summer - had left De Jong feeling 'very upset' given Barcelona had continued with their attempts to offload him even after it had been made clear that the player wished to stay at the Nou Camp. De Jong made it clear last month, though, that any ill-feeling between him and the club in relation to the saga was gone. In an interview with Dutch outlet NOS, De Jong said: ""I am at the club where I always wanted to be, where I dreamed of [Barcelona]."" When he was then quizzed about the possiblity of experiencing a new league and whether or not that held much appeal, he added: ""Possibly. But Iâm very satisfied at Barca. It's always difficult to say. For now I feel good here!"" Manchester United are expected to be active in the summer transfer window and a midfielder could be on Ten Hag's wishlist with Casemiro - who was signed from Real Madrid after talks with De Jong collapsed - expected to move on.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/De-Jong-could-leave-Barcelona-despite-being-left-very-upset-by-Man-Utd-saga/3299060,,11-Feb,all-football-app
3718,"'I thought f*** it, it won’t stop me’ - Chelsea loanee Colwill shrugs off Championship play-off final own goal","Levi Colwill addressed both his future and own goal following Huddersfield Town’s 1-0 Championship play-off final defeat to Nottingham Forest. Manchester United loanee James Garner produced a wicked cross which deflected off the 19-year-old’s knee and into the goal, which ultimately decided the match.  The defeat could spell the end of Colwill’s career in Yorkshire, with Premier League clubs now trying to buy him from Chelsea.  “I felt like we were the better team. You look at those two penalties and it felt very weird that not even one of them was given, they were both penalties,” Colwill told GOAL. “There wasn’t much I could do about the goal. I just wanted to block it but he kicked my knee up and it hit it. I didn't know what to say but I thought f*** it. I’ve got to play on and help the team. That’s what I tried to do. It was just unfortunate. It is football, bad luck, I won’t let it stop me or get my head down.  “It has been the best year of my life. I am proud. The staff and team have been brilliant. We had great togetherness and I am proud to be part of this team.  Adding about his future: “We will see [whether I stay for another season or go back to Chelsea]. I will focus on the internationals first and we will see after that.” In what might be Colwill’s last game for the Tykes, goalkeeper Lee Nicholls believes that the Cobham graduate should be aiming for the heights of Gareth Southgate’s national team as he embarks on Under-21s action straight after the showpiece event at Wembley. “Levi will go the whole way, I feel like he will go straight to the top,” Nicholls said at Wembley. “I feel like he could even become England captain if he wanted to be.” Meanwhile, Duane Holmes, who played with Fikayo Tomori at Derby County, thinks that the youngster is capable of matching the Serie A champion's achievements at AC Milan. “Listen, I’ve played with some good players and he is right up there,” USMNT international Holmes said. “I played with Tomori who plays centre-back for England and Levi is right up there with him.  “He is 19-years-old and he has been one of our best players this season. The own goal doesn’t matter one bit, he should be really proud of how he has handled himself in his first year as a professional.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-colwill-championship-play-off-final-own-goal/bltb649cc0ebb27df29,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

The League Two outfit, of which Neville is a part-owner alongside several other members of Manchester United's Class of '92, have moved through four different bosses in the space of two years. That turnover has not gone unnoticed by former Liverpool man Carragher, who was quick to have a dig at his colleague after the news broke. Salford took to social media to confirm Bowyer's exit on Tuesday, thanking the manager for his efforts at the club. Carragher could not resist having a pop at his Sky Sports pundit colleague and club owner Neville, with a typical jab drawing comparisons to the Prime Minister.

5815,'Man City are a mad team!' - Dias not intimidated by Champions League second leg visit to Real Madrid,"Manchester City star Ruben Dias insists that he and his ""mad"" team-mates will have no fears over facing Real Madrid away from home in the deciding match of their Champions League semi-final. The tie is poised on a knife-edge after City prevailed 4-3 in Tuesday's thrilling opener.  That result leaves Madrid in a competitive position ahead of the second leg in the Santiago Bernabeu, where they previously fought back from behind to eliminate Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16. ""We are aware of what team are we facing, the impact they have in the Champions League and the atmosphere at the Santiago Bernabeu,"" Dias told reporters following Tuesday's victory.  ""But we know our goal and what we need to achieve it. We are going to play with our personality and try to win. ""The Bernabeu is a mad place, but Man City are also a mad team. We will be ready for it. ""A semifinal and with the second leg in Madrid, the game was never going to be finished [after the first leg],"" he said. ""No matter what happened, it would never be finished here in this first leg. We know exactly what is coming and we are ready for it. ""I think with the chances we created, we feel that the result could have been more favorable for us. But at the end of the day, we won.  ""It's one final won and we need to win the second one next week in Madrid. The spirit is positive. We could have scored more, we could have conceded fewer goals, but we don't have time to reflect on that."" City will travel to the Spanish capital on May 4 for the second leg, by which time they will already know which of Liverpool or Villarreal await in the final.

1705,Ten Hag backed to get best out of Maguire by former Man Utd defender Stam,"Former Manchester United star Jaap Stam believes that Harry Maguire can turn around his fortunes at Old Trafford under the guidance of incoming manager Erik ten Hag.  Maguire, 29, has come under fire for his performances during a disappointing season for the Red Devils in 2021-22.  But he remains United's captain, and Stam claims that the Ajax coach's arrival could mark a turning point for the centre-back. ""I still think that Harry is a good player. He is a good defender,"" the former United and Netherlands defender told PA. ""You need to understand that every player - and I've had it myself - goes through rough spells that he's having and hard times, the confidence is a bit low, he's not feeling well and making mistakes. So when you cost £100m and you are making a mistake, yeah, the pressure on you is a lot more than when you're costing a few quid. ""He's played this season good games as well. Having this season now and maybe a new coach coming in, having a fresh start, learning a lot from this season as well and what he's done and what he needs to do. ""Does he need to make a change or not? Maybe having different players next to him or in front of him can help him out as well in terms of feeling more confident, so maybe next season you'll see a total different player."" Maguire became the world's most expensive defender in 2019 when he joined United from Leicester City in a deal believed to be worth £80 million. He made a strong start at the club and just months after signing was installed as the club captain by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, a position he has held ever since.  In 2021-22, however, Maguire has found himself under pressure as he has taken much of the blame for the Reds' subpar displays.  The club has conceded 52 goals in their 36 Premier League outings so far, up from 44 the previous term; though the biggest fall-off has been in attack, despite the return of Cristiano Ronaldo, where their goal tally has fallen from 73 to just 57 this season.  United currently occupy sixth place in the league standings, a position that would see them play in the Conference League in 2022-23.

Rudiger has reached a verbal agreement to join Madrid this summer, with his Chelsea career set to come to an end once his contract expires at the end of the season. But, when quizzed about the potential signing, Ancelotti played coy before saying he didn't feel comfortable talking about a player that is not at the club currently. ""Toni Rudiger? Toni who? Who’s this?"" Ancelotti said with a laugh when asked by beIN Sports.  ""He's still a Chelsea player. I can’t say anything about this."" The defender's contract is set to expire this season and, with the club still in a bit of limbo due to the ownership situation, Chelsea will be unable to re-sign him. Rudiger certainly has his share of suitors, with Manchester United, Barcelona and Juventus interested, while PSG and Bayern Munich also previously made offers. Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel all but acknowledged his departure, but says Rudiger will remain a key piece for the club right up until the day he leaves. ""He has no doubts and has made no doubts about it, he will play until the end of the season with everything he has,"" Tuchel said after his side's 1-0 win over West Ham.

44,Ex-Man Utd coach insists Ten Hag is the right man to fix Red Devils,"Erik ten Hag is the right man to whip Manchester United into shape, according to former coach Eric Steele, who believes the Dutchman can restore the club's prized culture with his arrival. The Ajax boss will take the reins at Old Trafford from next season, as he looks to restore the fortunes of the Red Devils. Ten Hag will inherit a squad low on belief and fractured by division, but Steele very much believes he is the figure best suited to the job. ""I've never known so much information come out of Manchester United's dressing room and become public,"" Steele told Sky Sports News. ""I'm sure he will very quickly discipline them and say, 'this has got to stop', which is precisely what's needed. I don't think he'll allow any of that."" Steele added that he hoped the Dutchman would bring unity, stating: ""When I was there you had big characters - the big players ran the dressing room, and that's what you want. ""You want them to have the belief, come in every day and want to be successful, to train hard every day to better the club, improve the team and be successful. At the moment it seems very much it's individuals being discussed and not the team."" Elsewhere, Steele was critical of the combative atmosphere that appears to have emerged between players, highlighting the lack of cohesive belief between them. ""There's arguments on the field between players,"" he added. ""Things that have happened in the dressing room that have come out - those simply wouldn't have happened when I was there under Sir Alex.

11481,Champions League Groups: The 2022-23 Preview,"The Champions League groups are now drawn, but who will prevail? In our 2022-23 UCL preview we look ahead to the main storylines prior to the 31st edition of the UEFA competition since its overhaul in 1992, with all 32 teams set to do battle in the opening matchday between 6-7 September. Lionel Messi has the chance to catch up with Cristiano Ronaldo’s record UEFA Champions League goal tally in 2022-23, with the Portuguese legend unable to add to his tally this season following Manchester United’s failure to qualify for the competition. Messi’s total of 125 goals is 15 fewer than Ronaldo’s 140, so whilst it’s unlikely that the Argentine will go as far as matching the record this season – Messi has never scored more than 14 in a single UCL campaign – he could put pressure on Ronaldo, considering he is also two years younger than his rival. Messi’s PSG side should advance to the latter stages of the competition in 2022-23, which will aid his quest for the record, but both he and Ronaldo will be looking over their shoulders, worrying about the threat posed by both Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappé in the race for the most UCL goals. Haaland is scoring at a trajectory never seen before in the UEFA Champions League. When he makes his UCL debut for Manchester City, Haaland will play his 20th match in the competition. He’s already guaranteed to have the record goal tally by a player after 20 Champions League appearances, with his 23 goals in 19 games already seven goals more than both Ruud van Nistelrooy and Roberto Soldado managed in their first 20 UCL apps (16 goals). When comparing Haaland to Messi, Ronaldo, Robert Lewandowski and Mbappé in a Champions League goal race chart, it’s clear how far ahead the Man City striker is. All-time leading Champions League scorer Ronaldo took 61 appearances to get to 23 goals – Haaland’s current tally – while he was only four months away from his 26th birthday when he did it. Mbappé (41 games) and Messi (42 games) were closer to Haaland, but still took over double the number of appearances to reach the tally, while Lewandowski reached 23 UCL goals in his 40th appearance. Haaland is a constant menace to opposition defences, only failing to score in five of his 19 games in the Champions League so far. His rate of scoring in 73.7% of his UCL apps (14 of 19) is better than any other player in the history of the competition to have played at least 10 matches, with both Messi (50.6%) and Ronaldo (50.8%) at a shade over 50% in terms of UCL appearances scored in, albeit from a much larger tally of games. If he continued his current rate of 0.83 goals per game in the Champions League, Haaland would be on 152 Champions League goals by the time he reaches Ronaldo’s total of 183 matches – 12 more than the Portuguese. Of course, a football career isn’t this simple to extrapolate, but it’s a scary thought. Manchester City will be hoping that the signing of Haaland will be the final piece of the puzzle in their mission to win the UEFA Champions League. This will be their 12th season in the competition – all of those in successive campaigns since 2011-12 – and the closest that they have come so far was in 2020-21, when they finished as runners-up to Chelsea. Only 14 teams have won more Champions League matches since 1992 than Manchester City (56), but all 56 of City’s wins have come since 2011-12 – the only clubs to have won more since then are Real Madrid (85), Bayern Munich (85) and Barcelona (69). 2011-12 was the first season that Paris Saint-Germain were taken over by Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani – the Qatari eventually taking 100% control in March 2012 after an initial 70% stake in the summer of 2011. Before that season, PSG had won just 16 games in the Champions League, but that tally is nearly four times higher since 2011-12, with 77.1% of their UCL victories coming since that takeover. Of the 20 clubs to have won the most games in the Champions League, only Man City (100%) and Atlético Madrid (86.3%) have secured a higher proportion of their wins since 2011-12. The investment in both PSG and Man City has obviously impacted the rest of Europe’s big clubs, but the fact remains that neither have been able to use their enviable wealth to secure a Champions League title. Only Arsenal (83) have won more Champions League matches than PSG (70) without winning a UCL title, while Manchester City’s tally of 56 wins is the fourth most of the clubs yet to win the trophy. With both Arsenal and Lyon absent from the 2022-23 Champions League, that leaves the pressure on PSG and Man City. In Pep Guardiola, City have one of the only eight coaches to have won at least two Champions League titles since the competition was rebranded from the European Cup in 1992 – his two successes coming with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011. Should he win a third, he’d join just Zinedine Zidane (three) and Carlo Ancelotti (four) in winning at least three UCL titles as a coach. Guardiola could well reach 100 wins as a coach in the Champions League this season, but he’d need his Manchester City side to at least make the knockout stages to make this happen. It’s very likely that he’ll be beaten to the landmark by the most successful manager in European Cup/Champions League history, however. Carlo Ancelotti is the only manager to win the competition four times – across both the old era before 1992 and since and needs just two wins this season as Real Madrid boss to reach the century of victories in the competition (excluding qualifiers). Ancelotti could even become the most successful manager in UCL history in terms of match wins, should his side secure five victories in the competition this season, overtaking Sir Alex Ferguson’s current record-tally of 102 wins. Should Ancelotti lead his reigning champions to the UCL final in 2022-23, he’ll break the Champions League record for number of games managed in the competition – the final would be his 191st game as a coach, again overtaking Ferguson (190). Jude Bellingham turned 19 years old on 29 June, meaning he will have another Champions League season as a teenager ahead of him.The Borussia Dortmund midfielder has already played 1,189 minutes in the competition – the seventh highest tally for a teenager in UCL history. With a possible 540 minutes available in the group stage for Bellingham to play, it’s likely he’ll move up to fourth in the rankings and there’s every possibility that he could overtake the tally of minutes played by Mbappé in the competition as a teenager (1,715), especially if the Englishman’s side progress to the knockout stages. Arguably the most exciting young English talent now, Bellingham has already been involved in six goals in his 16 appearances (two goals, four assists) in the Champions League. As a top-level comparison, before turning 20 years old, Cristiano Ronaldo had been involved in just one goal (no goals, one assist) in 10 games as a teenager, while Lionel Messi had been involved in just three (two goals, one assist) in 12 appearances before his 20th birthday – this despite both players being deployed in more advanced positions. Maccabi Haifa have become the first side from Israel to qualify for the UEFA Champions League proper since Maccabi Tel Aviv in 2015-16. The Greens themselves have qualified for a third Champions League edition, which is the most of an Israeli club, and their first since 2009-10. The bad news for them is that no side from Israel has ever progressed from a UEFA Champions League group stage, with Israeli clubs winning just four of 30 previous matches in the competition (D4 L22 excluding qualifiers). The slightly good news is that half of those wins, however, were by Maccabi Haifa in 2002-03 (two). One of Maccabi Haifa’s biggest goal threats in the UCL this season could be Frantzdy Pierrot, who scored five of their 14 goals during qualification this season. A Haitian international, he is likely to become the third player from Haiti to appear in the UEFA Champions League after Wilde-Donald Guerrier (six apps) and Réginal Goreux (three), but should he score he’d be the first UCL goalscorer from Haiti. Haiti are currently one of 24 nations to have had at least one player appear for them but not produce a goal in UEFA Champions League history – Pierrot will be hoping to reduce that list to 23. Kazakhstan – 16 players (55 cumulative appearances)Azerbaijan – 14 players (46 apps)Moldova – 7 players (18 apps)Gambia – 4 players (17 apps)China PR – 3 players (7 apps)Madagascar – 3 players (38 apps)Netherlands Antilles – 3 players (8 apps)Suriname – 3 players (19 apps)Guadeloupe – 3 players (13 apps)Haiti – 2 players (9 apps)Malaysia – 2 players (10 apps)Mozambique – 2 players (24 apps)Bahrain – Abdulla Yusuf Helal (2 apps)Burundi – Dugary Ndabashinze (4 apps)Curaçao – Vurnon Anita (10 apps)DPR Korea – Pak Kwang-Ryong (3 apps)Estonia – Ragnar Klavan (8 apps)Gibraltar – Danny Higginbothan (1 app)Guyana – Carl Cort (1 app)Libya – Djamal (1 app)Namibia – Collin Benjamin (2 apps)Qatar – Rodrigo Barbosa Tabata (3 apps)Seychelles – Michael Mancienne (1 app)Uganda – Joseph Kizito (1 app) We all have our own views on who might qualify from the UCL group stages this season, but what does the data say?

723,"Manchester City vs Watford: Predictions, tips & betting odds","Premier League leaders Manchester City welcome Watford to the Etihad Stadium on Saturday as Pep Guardiola's men aim to take another step towards defending their title. The Blues come into this round of fixtures just a point above Liverpool and know they can ill-afford to drop points if they wish to retain their Premier League crown. Watford, meanwhile, are battling for their lives, with time running out for the Hornets who are seven points from safety. City have suffered two league defeats in front of their own fans this season, going down to both Crystal Palace and Tottenham. The hosts on Saturday, however, are massive favourites to claim three points, with bet365 pricing them at 1/10 (1.10), with the draw at 9/1 (10.00) and the visitors at 25/1 (26.00). Gabriel Jesus and Riyad Mahrez are the two favourites to break the deadlock at 4/1 (5.00), while Kevin De Bruyne, Phil Foden and Raheem Sterling are all offered at 9/2 (5.50). The shortest priced Watford player to score first is Josh King at 22/1 (23.00). Watford's away form has been considerably better than their record at home, with Roy Hodgson's men winning two of their last five games on the road, as well as claiming a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford. Nevertheless, Saturday's return to Manchester is likely to be a much tougher prospect and City will be relishing the prospect of playing vulnerable opponents. The Blues look set to have all their attacking players available for the game and they have shown this season they are capable of demolishing sides in the lower part of the division. With a Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid in a few days' time, Guardiola will want to get the game won with the minimum of fuss and to try and give players a rest in the second half if possible. To that end, backing the hosts to get among the goals in the first half could make sense. Over 1.5 goals in the first half is offered at 10/11 (1.91) and looks like an excellent option for this game, one which has paid out in five of City's last eight home league matches. Odds correct at the time of writing. 18+. begambleaware.org ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/manchester-city-vs-watford-predictions-tips-and-betting-odds/bltcc4fe6c65c02609e,Phil Kitromilides,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4829,Courtois ready to take Champions League final penalty for Real Madrid,"Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois would be prepared to take a penalty if the 2022 Champions League final has to be settled on spot-kicks. The Belgium international is more concerned with containing the threat posed by Liverpool heading into the European encounter at Stade de France on Saturday. He is however aware that two heavyweight outfits may cancel each other out, bringing a nerve-shredding shootout into the equation, and has history from his time at Chelsea of stepping up from 12 yards. The shot-stopper is doing his homework on potential takers for Liverpool, and said when asked if he could take a penalty himself: “I remember in pre-season with Chelsea against PSG I scored one and in the Community Shield against Arsenal I missed one. “(Antonio) Conte put me there because he knew I could shoot well, but obviously standing on the spot, in an important moment, is different. “I wouldn’t be one of the first five (takers), for sure, but maybe after, if you need to shoot, you have to shoot. I don’t fear it. It’s a moment to shine. “We won one (shootout) against Atletico Madrid in the Super Cup a few years ago when I saved one penalty. This season I have saved three. “You study ahead. Against Chelsea we had two penalties and you study them, because you can see the similarities. Hopefully it will not come back to that but if it does, I will be ready.” Thibaut Courtois is an incredible goalkeeper 👏 pic.twitter.com/UIcDO53WZF Courtois helped Madrid to Super Cup success back in 2020 when keeping out a decisive spot-kick from Atletico midfielder Thomas Partey. He has saved a further 11 efforts in competitive action down the years, outside of shootouts, with some notable names on his roll of honour. Lionel Messi has been denied on two occasions by the Belgian, with the most recent coming in THE Champions League last-16 encounter between Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain this season. Courtois also kept out Raul Garcia during the Supercopa clash with Athletic Club in January, while Goncalo Guedes fluffed his lines for Valencia in a Liga fixture a few days prior to that.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/courtois-champions-league-final-penalty-real-madrid/bltdcd5d065498197ba,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

The Baggies currently occupy fourth place as they look to make an instant return to the Premier League following last season's relegation.  Dike, 21, is rated as one of the United States men's national team's top young attacking players and will hope to add further firepower to his new club's promotion bid. ""Albion are delighted to confirm the permanent transfer of United States of America international Daryl Dike from Orlando City, subject to international clearance,"" West Brom affirmed on the club's official website.  Welcome to Albion, @DarylDike. 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/HRHNXWTYaF ""The 21-year-old striker, who joins the Baggies for an undisclosed fee, has signed a four-and-a-half-year contract at The Hawthorns.  ""Dike netted 11 goals in 19 MLS appearances last season and has earned eight caps for his country.  ""He again teams up with head coach Valerien Ismael after firing Barnsley to the Sky Bet Championship Play-Offs with nine goals in 19 fixtures during a four-month loan spell at Oakwell last term."" Dike was drafted by Orlando City in 2020 and made an instant impact in MLS, scoring eight goals in 17 games in his debut season and finishing third in the league's Young Player of the Year vote.

There are hardly a few top players in every generation who receive offers from other top European leagues and move out of England to make a career. A few of the prominent English players who decided to leave the Premier League at some point in their careers are David Beckham, Gary Lineker, Michael Owen and Paul Gascoigne. Both Beckham and Owen played for Real Madrid in the mid-2000s. Beckham even played for AC Milan, LA Galaxy and PSG. Lineker and Gascoigne, on the other hand, played for FC Barcelona and Lazio.

9182,'Best 1v1 winger in the world' wants Premier League move - it could be the end for Mudryk,"Chelsea have found some problems when it comes to their left-wing position this season, with neither Raheem Sterling nor Mykhailo Mudryk showing any consistency.The Ukranian winger, in particular, has really struggled and only has five goal contributions in 19 appearances – with most of his performances infuriating fans.It seems that Chelsea could find an ‘upgrade’ over Mudryk in the summer transfer window in the form of AC Milan winger Rafael Leao.As per Foot Mercato, he has reached the end of his cycle at the Serie A side and wants a move to a Premier League or La Liga club.Leao has been hailed as the best 1v1 winger in the world, being reputed for his impressive dribbling skills and excellent final product.The Portuguese winger has scored six goals and provided nine assists in 28 appearances this season and has nearly 100 goal contributions in 191 appearances for Milan.He could be the electric, prolific left-winger to take things to a new level for Chelsea and be a perfect repalcement for Mudryk – but the Blues face competition from clubs like PSG.Lampard's honest opinion about Mudryk revealed — and it's damningMudryk told he has no 'football brain': 'What is he good at?'",https://tribuna.com/en/news/chelsea-2024-02-13-best-1v1-winger-in-the-world-wants-premier-league-move-it-could-be-the-end-for-mudryk/,Uttiyo Scarnage,2024-02-13T19:53:00.000Z,Foot Mercato
11106,53 and Counting: Harry Kane on the Cusp of Becoming England Men’s Record Goalscorer,"With 53 goals, Harry Kane is level with Wayne Rooney as England’s record goalscorer. Barring something unforeseen, he’s going to break the scoring record – it’s just a matter of when. He could even do so tonight against Italy, as England’s UEFA European Qualification campaign gets underway. But does he get the credit he deserves? We look at all the stats from the Three Lions’ soon-to-be leading scorer. When Harry Kane placed the ball on the spot for the second time against France in the FIFA World Cup 2022 quarter-final, he did so with a chance to do two things. First, and most pressingly, this was a chance to level the tie at 2-2 and – probably – send it into extra time. Second, with Kane on 53 goals overall for his country, it was an opportunity to become England’s leading goalscorer. As it was, the England captain blazed the ball over the bar. The record, although inevitable, would have to wait. At the same tournament, Kane had bagged his 52nd second goal for the Three Lions against Senegal in the round of 16, before tying Rooney’s all-time record of 53 with his first penalty attempt against France. Now, almost eight years to the day since Kane’s England debut (and first goal), he has the chance to finally take sole ownership of the record. Kane’s start to his senior England international career couldn’t have gone much better – scoring just 79 seconds into his debut against Lithuania in March 2015. That game saw him replace Rooney on the pitch, a substitution that now seems to hold greater significance eight years on. In records dating to 1872, Kane is one of only six players to score within his first two minutes of England action, and the most recent player to do so before Kane was Gerry Hitchens in 1961. Following such a rapid start to his international career, the Spurs striker went on to add goals in his third and fourth caps for the Three Lions, but by the end of a disappointing exit in Euro 2016 to Iceland, Kane’s international pedigree was beginning to be questioned with just five goals in 17 appearances. That period also coincided with Roy Hodgson giving him a strange new role as senior corner taker in the side. Following a goalless 82-minute appearance in Slovakia under Sam Allardyce (remember when this happened?), the appointment of Gareth Southgate as England boss led to a rapid acceleration in Kane’s goalscoring for his country. Since Southgate came in, Kane’s scored 48 goals in 63 caps. No player has ever scored more for a single manager in England men’s history. In fact, those 48 goals are 30 more than any other England player during Southgate’s tenure as coach, ahead of Raheem Sterling’s 18. Of England’s 169 goals under Southgate, Kane’s 48 represent 28%, while with 14 additional assists, he’s been involved in 36% of the Three Lions’ goals in all competitions since Southgate’s first game versus Malta in October 2016. Naturally, when England’s major tournament qualifying calendar contains games against “lesser” footballing nations – Kane scoring seven goals in consecutive games against Albania and San Marino in November 2021 comes to mind – his record comes into question. True, only six of his 53 goals have come against teams ranked in the top 10 of the FIFA rankings at the time of the fixture (11%), with three of those coming in friendlies. He’s also scored more goals against San Marino (five) than he has against any other opponent in his England career, but that shouldn’t take the gloss off any eventual goal record he breaks for the Three Lions. Important goals at Euro 2020 against 12th-ranked Germany and 10th-ranked Denmark were his first goals against teams in the top 15 of the FIFA Rankings since a winner against Croatia in the UEFA Nations League in November 2018. He of course also scored a penalty against fourth-ranked France last winter at the 2022 World Cup. However, since that Croatia win, England have played just 12 games against teams ranked in the top 15 of the FIFA rankings, and Kane’s scored six goals across 1,010 minutes on the pitch in these fixtures. Kane scored the fourth and fifth England senior hat-tricks of his career across four days in those two meetings with Albania and San Marino back in November an impressive feat considering only two players had previously scored back-to-back hat-tricks for England. Kane joined Vivian Woodward (1909), Dixie Dean (1927) and Tommy Taylor (1957) in scoring hat-tricks in successive appearances, while he drew level with Gary Lineker on five hat-tricks overall for England – only Jimmy Greaves (six) has more for the men’s senior team. With four goals in Serravalle against San Marino on November 15 2021, he also became the first England player to score four times in a single appearance since Ian Wright in 1993 – also against San Marino. In fact, the previous occasion of a player scoring four goals for England before Wright also came in a match against the Sammarinese, with David Platt’s four goals 10 months prior in the 1994 World Cup qualifiers. Kane’s seven-goal haul across those four days in November meant that he ended 2021 with 16 goals for England, breaking another record. In 2019, he equalled the feats of Dixie Dean in 1927 and George Hilsdon in 1908 by scoring 12 times in a calendar year, but his four goals in Serravalle accelerated the current England captain past these tallies. With 53 goals in 80 appearances, Kane is on the cusp of breaking the England men’s goal record as we head into qualifying for the European Championships in 2024. Drawn in a group against the likes of Malta and North Macedonia, Kane will be looking to extend his lead in the goalscoring charts. But how did Kane compare at this stage in his career with other England legends? Looking at the trajectory of Kane’s England goals by appearances, he’s well ahead of both Bobby Charlton and Wayne Rooney by this stage of his international career. After 80 caps, current record scorer Rooney had 34 goals while Charlton had netted 43 times by this stage of his England career. Age is also on Harry Kane’s side. His goal against France in England’s last competitive game came while he was 29 years, 135 days old – an age at which both Rooney (46 goals in 101 apps) and Charlton (41 goals in 77 apps) had scored fewer. Gary Lineker had only played 47 games for England at the same age as Kane is now, 33 fewer than Kane, but had an impressive return of 30 goals at a rate of a strike every 125 minutes. That’s still less impressive than Kane’s current ratio of a goal every 117 minutes for the Three Lions. The late Jimmy Greaves deserves a mention here, too. He made his final England appearance in May 1967 at just 27 years, and 96 days old, ending his senior international career with 44 goals in 57 apps and a minutes-per-goal ratio the same as Kane’s (117). Cristiano Ronaldo holds the record for the most international goals by a male player, with 118 goals in 196 appearances for Portugal. The Portuguese moved ahead of the only other male with at least 100 international goals – Iran’s Ali Daei with 109 goals in 148 games – when he scored twice against the Republic of Ireland in Portugal’s European Qualifier in Faro-Loulé in September 2021, aged 36. So, what chance does Kane have of moving past 100 goals on the international stage and getting anywhere near Ronaldo’s record? Well, in this case, age isn’t on his side. Kane’s 53rd international goal against France at the 2022 FIFA World Cup came on his 80th cap with the Spurs’ striker aged 29 years and 135 days old – over three years older than Ronaldo was on his 71st cap in June 2010 (26 years, three days). Ronaldo had less than half the goal tally at this stage of his international career, however (26). His goal record took another two years to really accelerate, with 86 goals in 106 caps since the start of the 2012 European Championship finals. Ronaldo is currently on 196 international caps for Portugal and is set to break the all-time men’s international caps record (Bader Al-Mutawa 196 for Kuwait) in Portugal’s Euro 2024 qualifier at home to Liechtenstein on Thursday. With Kane needing to play another 116 games for England to replicate this tally – this feels very unlikely given that only one male outfielder has ever won as many England caps as this in their entire career – Wayne Rooney (120). Being a top international goalscorer inevitably means you will score more goals against so-called minnows than the crème de la crème of the international scene – it shouldn’t put a dampener on any records set. Harry Kane will break the England men’s goalscoring record, maybe even doing so tonight against Italy, at which point it should be celebrated, not dismissed.

2614,Gravenberch acknowledges Bayern Munich interest as Ajax contract negotiations break down,"Ajax star Ryan Gravenberch has acknowledged interest from Bayern Munich and said contract negotiations with his current club have stopped entirely. The 19-year-old featured at Euro 2020 and has drawn attention around Europe as his profile has risen. Gravenberch said he is flattered by the spotlight as he works to regain his place in the Dutch national team after a dip in club form. ""The contract negotiations have now been stopped,"" the midfielder told NOS. ""I just have one more year of contract now and that's it, really. We'll see. ""My father and agent are very busy with [handling other clubs] while I focus on football. ""Yeah, of course [I've seen the Bayern interest]. You can read it everywhere, so there is interest from Bayern, but I think there are several clubs."" ""I have no idea [what I'm worth], I have no idea. But if you're worth €25 million (as has been reported), you can be proud because it's a lot of money, of course."" It's been an up-and-down campaign since he starred at the Euros, and he was left out of the senior Netherlands squad for this international break. Dutch manager Louis van Gaal has said the player's form led to that decision, however Gravenberch isn't concerned. ""A lesser phase, I don't want to see it that way,"" he said. ""Before the winter break I didn't play such very good games, but after the winter it really only went up. ""Then the team does well and you have to fight yourself back into the team, I just did that in the end. ""So I don't agree with that [assessment from Van Gaal] so much."" Regardless of how his current form is viewed, Gravenberch is still widely considered one of the world's best youngsters and plays for a club renowned for developing players. He has featured in 26 league matches this year after appearing in 32 last term. As a result, teams such as Bayern Munich have grown very interested in his services.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/gravenberch-acknowledges-bayern-munich-interest-as-ajax-contract-/blt9df0921aa56e2540,Dan Bernstein,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11904,The Data Day No. 6: Our Rolling Football Blog,"Welcome to The Data Day, our rolling football stats blog for 2021-22, where we try and make sense of what just happened. Sebastien Haller left the Premier League as an apparent failure, even though he actually scored 10 goals in a season and a half, which, let’s be honest, isn’t terrible. Still, when Ajax came in for him at the start of 2021, not many West Ham fans were distraught. The farcical postscript was that Ajax then forgot to register him for their Europa League squad, so he had to sit that out. We’ll never know how Haller would have done in European competition last season, but if this season is anything to go by, the answer is: pretty well. Haller scored not one, not two, not three but four goals as Ajax romped to a 5-1 win against Sporting, in Lisbon. Sebastien Haller joins Wayne Rooney in the elite club of players who have been sold by David Moyes so they can score a hat-trick on their CL debut Haller becomes only the second player to score four goals within 63 minutes of a Champions League games, after Cristiano Ronaldo against Malmo in 2015, the second player to score four goals on his Champions League debut after the great Marco van Basten for Milan in November 1992 and by scoring four he has already surpassed Manchester United’s entire three-goal 2005-06 Champions League campaign. Moyes’ West Ham play Manchester United without the suspended Michail Antonio on Sunday. Imagine if they had legendary Champions League marksman Sebastien Haller to call on. -DA Liverpool and AC Milan met tonight for only the third time in their long, storied histories, but the clubs with a combined 13 European Cup wins between them seem to pump more narrative into their occasional clashes than some other matchups serve up over decades. Technically tonight’s game at Anfield was Liverpool’s first win against Milan, having drawn the 2005 Champions League final (a match deciding mechanic was used, yes) and then losing the final of the same competition two years later. After 15 minutes of this one it seemed like Liverpool were intent on reminding Milan just how much football’s elite competition had moved on in the Italian club’s absence. Jurgen Klopp’s side, if you include the own goal from Fikayo Tomori, produced 12 shots in the first 15 minutes, a spell that also included Mohamed Salah’s first missed penalty in 18 attempts, something that inspired a superb double save from ‘keeper Mike Maignan. It was breathless football and Milan were not coping well, particularly with the liquid combination of Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold on the right hand flank. But this was a Liverpool v Milan game so incredible spates of goals in a short period are par for the course. The visitors scored twice in the space of one minute and 50 seconds to go into half-time 2-1 up. Milan then had a goal disallowed for offside early in the second half, only to see Liverpool regain control, score two more goals of their own, including a Steven Gerrard tribute strike from current captain Jordan Henderson to take the three points and clock up another classic Champions League night at Anfield. 23 shots from Liverpool was a lot, but still pales against the 34 they managed in the epic defeat there against Atletico Madrid in March 2020. That had been the last Champions League game at Anfield in front of a full crowd before tonight’s match. 57 Liverpool shots across two games is a decent spread for the fans. The full European experience in other words. And even though they lost, Milan must be delighted to be back. -DA Perhaps you’ve been watching the Champions League group stage for some years and gotten to know the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atlético Madrid. Those clubs make up seven of 20 UCL finalists over the past decade. Yesterday, Barcelona went without a shot on target in a 3-0 loss to Bayern Munich. Tonight, Real Madrid went without a shot on target until the 57th minute before finding a way to three points in the 89th against Inter Milan. And Atlético played to a goalless draw against Porto. Had Rodrygo not scored for Real, it would have been the first time on record all three played on a single UCL matchday and didn’t score.  Sevilla and Villareal are also in the competition and played to draws yesterday, albeit at least with goals, but the Spanish sides that had often dominated continental football over much of the past decade managed six points from a possible 15. You could absolutely say Real were a bit lucky to win with a significant xG advantage for Inter: And you could say the same for the Atlético-Porto match with Diego Simeone’s side flirting with that 0.2 xG Barça put up yesterday: Villarreal accounted for seven of the group’s 13 shots on target, while Real, Barça and Atléti combined for 1.51 xG. Speaking of Rodrygo, he’s about as close as it comes to our next subject for scoring efficiency in the Champions League in recent seasons… -KC Robert Lewandowski scored a brace yesterday against Barcelona to reach 75 goals in the Champions League. Erling Haaland has some work to do to get there. But with his first-half stoppage-time goal against Besiktas Wednesday, he’s on 21 Champions League goals since his debut in the competition at the start of 2019-20. That’s one behind Lewandowski for the competition lead in that time, but the 21-year-old’s efficiency in that time has been unmatched. His 21 goals have come on a 15.08 xG, and his overperformance of that mark is easily the best in the competition since his debut: -KC Bayern Munich have now won their opening game in each of their last 18 Champions League seasons, and Barcelona have lost their opening match in the competition for the first time since 1997. No unbiased party is surprised by one run continuing and the other ending via Julian Nagelsmann’s first Champions League match in charge of the eternal German champions. That’s the current expectation of a Champions League match at the Camp Nou when a true European giant visits because Barcelona themselves don’t fit that classification in their present state. Bayern’s opening match run in the competition goes back to 2003-04 with those 18 wins coming with a combined 45-2 scoreline, whereas Barça’s last 10 Champions League matches overall have seen them concede 21. The Bavarians also happen to be unbeaten in their last 19 away UEFA Champions League matches (W15 D4), the longest undefeated away run in the history of the Champions League and European Cup. Nagelsmann’s competition debut as the club’s manager also extends a run of them scoring in Champions League games to 23, and Thomas Müller started it off with his seventh in six UCL appearances against Barcelona after scoring twice in an 8-2 win the last time they met. Thomas Müller in the Champions League vs Barcelona:23-04-2013:️⚽️⚽️01-05-2013: ️⚽️06-05-2015: ❌12-05-2015:️⚽️14-08-2020: ⚽️⚽️14-09-2021: ⚽️He's scored more #UCL goals versus Barcelona than any other player. He may be the highest-scoring player against the Catalans in the competition, but perhaps the most impressive number of the day goes to a celebrated teammate. Robert Lewandowski scored his 74th and 75th Champions League goals in his 92nd match and even more outlandishly his 18th straight match in a row for Bayern in all competitions. The last time Lewandowski appeared for Bayern and didn’t score was Feb. 11 against Tigres in the Club World Cup. That… is a long time ago. For Barcelona, there was a glaring lack of a No. 10. Perhaps you’ve heard Messi’s in Paris, while his heir Ansu Fati hasn’t played since suffering a knee injury in November, but they might as well have have settled for the predecessor in this one in 41-year-old Ronaldinho. Ronald Koeman’s side didn’t manage a shot on target, and prior to their dismal 0.2 xG tonight, their lowest xG total in the previous five Champions League seasons was 0.4 against Borussia Dortmund in 2019-20. It was only their eighth match in their last 50 in the competiton where they hadn’t reached 1.0 xG. On a more basic level, Barcelona hadn’t lost their opening match in a Champions League campaign since falling at Newcastle in 1997, remaining unbeaten in their previous 22 opening matches. The objective expectations of this club are not that of years past, and that played out from the announcement of their starting XI – a back three – through full time. It’s clear what this means for Bayern: another dominant Champions League group stage is upon us. For Barcelona, the level of uncertainty seems to be drawn back a month on the UCL calendar each season, and there’s no guarantee this one will stretch beyond Matchday 6 in December. This match was the first between the two traditional UCL powers in the group stage since 1998-99 when Bayern won both matches and Barça failed to advance to the knockout stages. They last failed to advance in 2000-01, and normally there would be comfort in knowing Benfica and Dynamo Kyiv await, but for Koeman’s side the word comfort may be only a distant echo of the past. – KC The first match of Manchester United’s Champions League season started with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring a goal, and it ended with his replacement giving one away. Between Manchester United taking an early lead and conceding a late one on Jesse Lingard’s inexcusable back pass, Aaron Wan Bissaka’s 35th-minute red card changed the dynamic of the match. Still, it looked like they’d leave Switzerland with a point. Instead, United made former Huddersfield Town boss David Wagner the sixth manager to win both a Premier League game and a Champions League game against Manchester United as Young Boys snatched all three points nearly five minutes into stoppage time. This 2-1 defeat was the first time Manchester United have lost a UCL group stage game to a team that came through qualifying since a 1-0 loss to CFR Cluj in December 2012. A very small consolation for United was Cristiano Ronaldo scored again. 135 goals in the UEFA Champions League is mightily impressive. That’s the same tally of goals that Theo Walcott’s scored in his entire professional career across club and country. It’s a lot. This was his 177th appearance in the competition, drawing level with Iker Casillas’s all-time record and he celebrated it with another goal – the 17th successive season that he’s scored in the Champions League. With his opening goal of this match, Ronaldo broke another Champions League record. It was 12 years and 132 days since he scored his last UCL goal for Manchester United, with this breaking the previous record held by Javier Zanetti at Internazionale, set in October 2010 (11 years, 315 days). Ronaldo also equalled the record tally of opponents scored against in the competition, with Young Boys being his 36th victim. This draws him level with Lionel Messi for now, although the PSG forward will come up against a new opponent in the form of Club Brugge tomorrow night with the odds on him making it 37 and getting one up on the Portuguese. In 68 Champions League appearances since turning 30, Ronaldo has scored 63 goals. That tally is 35 more than any other player has scored aged 30 or older in the history of the competition and it feels like he’s got petrol in the tank to go much further. United’s only two shots came from Ronaldo and neither came after the 25th minute. True, the Red Devils were hampered by Wan-Bissaka’s red card, but when you’ve got the Champions League most prolific scorer and shooter, it’s probably a weapon you should use a little wiser. – MF How much attention did you pay to the Premier League action across matchday four of the 2021-22 season? It’s time to put your knowledge to the test with our latest English top-flight quiz.  – MF This weekend saw the return of club football across the top five European leagues following the international break. With players now back in the groove following the summer, we saw some great individual displays between Friday and Sunday – we’ve pulled out for of the best of them. Karim Benzema had a hand in four of Real Madrid’s goals in their 5-2 win over Celta de Vigo on Sunday, netting a hat-trick, as well as assisting Vinícius Júnior’s strike at the Bernabéu. This was his third La Liga hat-trick, and the first since April 2019 against Athletic Club, but it was the first time he’s been involved in as many as four goals in a single Spanish top-flight match since October 2013. As the highest-scoring active player in La Liga, his goal tally now stands at 197 across his 13 seasons at Real Madrid and the Frenchman looks set to soon become just the 10th player in the history of the competition to reach 200. In total this season, Benzema’s been involved in nine league goals (five goals, four assists) – more than any other player across the top five European leagues in 2021-22, as he looks set to enjoy his fourth successive 20+ goal season in the Spanish top-flight. Wilfried Zaha was a constant threat in Crystal Palace’s 3-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur in the opening game of the Premier League Matchday on Saturday. Zaha attempted four shots, created three chances and scored the opening goal from the penalty spot. This opener was Crystal Palace’s 500th Premier League goal (now on 502), 57 of which have been penalties. At 11.4%, that’s the highest proportion of the 20 sides to score 500+ goals in the competition’s history. He posted an expected assists figure of 1.0 in this match, this highest of any Premier League player across the weekend, and in addition to 0.89 xG he was the most threatening player in the English top-flight on Matchday 4. Paul Pogba helped himself to two more assists in Manchester United’s emphatic 4-1 victory over Newcastle on Saturday. His seasonal tally now stands at seven – a Premier League record after four games of a single season – and he already has more than he posted in 2019-20 and 2020-21 (three in each season) combined. That said, based on the quality of passes that he’s made to teammates this season in the top-flight (measure by xA) we would have expected the average player to have assisted just a single goal. In fact, Pogba has made less threatening open-play passes than Trent Alexander-Arnold (1.81), Mason Mount (1.47), Jack Grealish (1.32), Riyad Mahrez (1.22) and Wilfried Zaha (1.2) in the Premier League this season but has one more open play assist than those five players combined (six). It’s clear that Pogba’s assist total has been inflated by exceptional finishing from his teammates and shows why assists alone can’t be used as a metric to determine creative quality. The Frenchman certainly enjoyed himself on Cristiano Ronaldo’s return to Manchester, with 106 passes completed in the game. This was the first time that he’s completed over 100 in a single Premier League match. Nice goalkeeper Walter Benítez is yet to concede a goal in Ligue 1 this season, with the Argentine keeping his fourth clean sheet in as many games for Nice in their 2-0 win over Nantes on Sunday. No goalkeeper in the top five European leagues has played as many minutes as Benítez (360) without conceding a goal this season, despite him facing 12 shots on target. Based on our expected goals on target model, he’s prevented 3.2 goals for his side with his saves in 2021-22 so far, behind only Rennes’ Alfred Gomis (3.4) across the top five European leagues. In the 2-0 win at Nantes this weekend, Benítez made six saves without conceding a goal – his best record in a match when keeping a clean sheet since April 2019 (seven vs Rennes). – MF A year to the day since Mohamed Salah scored a Premier League hat-trick in a 4-3 win against Leeds United, the Egyptian superstar was at it again versus the Whites. Salah’s goal saw him become the 30th player to score 100 goals in the Premier League, but the fifth fastest to reach the century (162 appearances). Two of his 100 Premier League goals came in his earlier spell at Chelsea, but he’s been almost unplayable since he arrived at Anfield on the eve of 2017-18. Since his debut in August 2017, Salah has 98 goals in 149 Premier League appearances – 10 more than the next best: Harry Kane (88). In addition to this, his 35 assists have only been trumped by Kevin De Bruyne’s 50. A quite ridiculous record of 133 goal involvements across those 149 games. His goal today was assisted by Trent Alexander-Arnold – just the fifth time that he’s had a goal created by the Englishman in the competition. Even before today, Alexander-Arnold had the highest expected assists total (1.73) and tally of chances created (15) in the Premier League across 2021-22. He was in fine form again in this match at Elland Road, with a further 0.66 xA and five chances created. He reached 35 Premier League assists in this match, at 22 years and 340 days – only Cesc Fábregas, Wayne Rooney and Ryan Giggs have reached this total at a younger age in the competition. His expected assists average of 0.60 per 90 this season is his highest ever – more than double his previous best from 2019-20 (0.27). Of course, this is a small sample size in 2021-22 (360 minutes), but it’s a great start and to put how high this is into perspective, the highest per 90 average in the Premier League last season was 0.28 by both Bruno Fernandes and City’s De Bruyne. Leeds are still waiting for their first win of the Premier League season with two draws and two defeats so far, but two of those games have come against the second- and third-placed teams in the top-flight last season. Yes, people will point to Marcelo Bielsa’s side allowing their opponents a league-high 28 shots on target and 8.8 expected goals (third highest). But this isn’t dissimilar to the exact same fixtures in 2020-21, where they allowed an xG of 8.03.  An ounce of comfort to Leeds fans will be that their next Premier League game comes up against Newcastle United, who have conceded better quality chances to opponents this season than any other team (10.53 xG) and are the only side to have conceded more goals (12) than Leeds (11). This will be a more accurate marker of where the 2021-22 version of Leeds United are at. – MF Some said Cristiano Ronaldo’s return to Manchester United had echoes of the club’s decision to sign Alexis Sanchez in 2018. A big-name forward who had interested Manchester City before finding his way to Old Trafford instead, Sanchez’s time at the club was little short of a disaster, the Chilean scoring only three goals in 32 league appearances. Ninety minutes into Ronaldo’s second spell at United and he is only one goal short of Sanchez’s entire Premier League output. Ronaldo started the day 16 goals short of 100 in the Premier League and four behind Kevin Davies; both key targets have been closed down by two.  Before his goalscoring output went into the stratosphere at Real Madrid, Ronaldo’s Premier League specialty was scoring braces. Today’s double against Newcastle was his 22nd pair of goals in England’s top-flight, taking him ahead of Les Ferdinand into eighth place. Famously Ronaldo has only ever scored one hat-trick in the Premier League but based on this display, a second is surely inevitable in the coming weeks. It was a typically disjointed performance by Manchester United in the first half, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s team having plenty of the ball (70% possession) but still presenting Newcastle with a series of reasonable attacking opportunities. That hole in central midfield hasn’t been plugged by Ronaldo or Varane or Sancho, that’s for sure. Manchester United still went into the break in the lead, though, thanks to Ronaldo’s 119th goal for the club, scored from close range after goalkeeper Freddy Woodman spilled Mason Greenwood’s shot right at Ronaldo’s feet. Not advisable. It was the United No. 7’s fifth shot of the half, although as you can see on the expected goals map below, two of those earlier efforts came from tight angles, both following a flurry of stepovers, as Ronaldo turned the clock back 12 years. There were a few signs of frustration before the first goal came, with Jadon Sancho – who was three years old during Ronaldo’s first debut for the club in 2003 – getting some exasperated arm gestures at a few points. Ronaldo’s only shot of the second half was his second goal, assisted by Luke Shaw, but while hugely popular with the home crowd, it served only as a warm-up act for the best goal of the game, Bruno Fernandes reminding everyone that other Portuguese players are available. It was his eighth goal from outside the box in his time at Manchester United, which is more than any other Premier League player in the same period. Presumably stripped of penalty duties, and with fewer direct free-kicks on the menu too, Fernandes will now relish open-play shots from distance, and he even had one from the halfway line in the first half, channelling David Beckham just as Ronaldo channeled Cristiano Ronaldo. One game into the season and Ronaldo has had 10% of United’s shots. Despite Bruno’s efforts, that ratio will increase. But perhaps the most important number of the day was Paul Pogba adding assists for United’s third and fourth goals. Seven assists from four games is more than any other player in Premier League history has had at this stage of the season, and in this form Pogba surely has the competition record of 20 – held by Thierry Henry and Kevin De Bruyne – in his sights. United’s policy of adding big names to their squad brought Pogba back to Old Trafford five years ago. Sometimes coming back to a club can work out, and United’s fortunes this season may depend on two players trying to prove that is the case. -DA 7 PL assists for Paul Pogba so far in 2021-22 equals Paul Scholes' highest total in a complete PL season Following a brief hiatus to appease the gods of international football, the Premier League is back. The opening three matchdays have produced an average of 2.83 goals per game, which is way lower than this stage last season (3.68) but higher than six of the previous eight seasons after three rounds of fixtures. Spurs are top of the league without a single goal conceded, Arsenal are bottom without a single goal scored – will the gap between the north London rivals increase to 12 points on matchday four? It’s Spurs that kick the new gameweek off, with a trip south of the Thames to Crystal Palace. Tottenham have started a league campaign with three wins and three clean sheets for the first time in their history. Only four teams have ever begun a top-flight campaign with four wins and no goals conceded – Aston Villa in 1900-01, Ipswich Town in 1974-75, Chelsea in 2005-06 and Manchester City in 2015-16. Our match predictor gives them a 50.3% chance of making it four wins from four – the third highest chance of an away win in the Premier League this weekend. Manchester City (58.2%) are given the highest chance of picking up three points on the road in the Premier League across MD4. Pep Guardiola’s side travel to Leicester City with victories in their last two visits there in the league. In fact, of all Premier League fixtures to have been played at least 20 times, Leicester vs Man City is the only one to have been won by the away side over 50% of the time – 11 away wins in 20 games (55%). The team with the highest chance of winning this weekend in the Premier League according to our win predictor are bottom side Arsenal (68.8%). Yes, we do think they can win a match. Their relegation six-pointer against Norwich City will see at least one of the two pick up their first points of the season, with Arsenal playing in their first Saturday 3pm match in the Premier League since June 2020…which they lost 2-1 to Brighton and Hove Albion. Only once in their history have Arsenal lost each of their first four league games to a season, doing so in the 1923-24 top-flight campaign, while they have never failed to score in any of their opening four league games before. Cristiano Ronaldo is likely to make his second debut in the Premier League, following his dramatic move back to Manchester United last month. If he plays this match, he’ll set a new Premier League record for the longest gap between appearances in the competition’s history (12 years and 118 days). Manchester United have lost just one of their last 36 home league games against Newcastle (W26 D9), with that defeat coming in December 2013 under David Moyes (0-1). Our match predictor gives them a 59.8% chance of making it one in 37 this Saturday. The only match on Sunday this week sees Leeds United meet Liverpool at Elland Road. This fixture has produced a few classic games over the years, with their November 2000 clash that ended 4-3 to the Whites one of the most memorable. Leeds are winless in their last eight Premier League games against Liverpool (L5 D3) and our match predictor thinks it’ll most likely stretch to nine with Jürgen Klopp’s side being given a 52.1% chance of picking up all three points. – MF",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2021/09/the-data-day-no-6-our-rolling-football-blog/,Matt Furniss,15/09/2021 15:00,the-analyst

5354,'Elneny needs Arsenal's help after second international heartbreak' - Arteta,"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta hopes his charges can help Mohamed Elneny recover emotionally after he failed to help Egypt qualify for the 2022 World Cup. The midfielder was part of the Pharaohs' team that fell 3-1 to Senegal on Tuesday in the shootout after a 1-1 aggregate draw over two legs. It was the second time Egypt fell to the West Africans on penalties in less than two months. In February, the Lions of Teranga defeated the Mohamed Salah-led team to be crowned the Africa Cup of Nations champions for the first time in their history. Arteta believes it is tough for the 29-year-old and his teammates can help him get better. ""Well, I think the majority of [Arsenal players who were on international duty] had some really good experiences, some really good performances, they scored some important goals as well,"" Arteta said in a press conference. ""I'm really sad for Mo Elneny because it is the second time that has happened and emotionally that means a lot to him, so I am sure the team will be here and ready to help him."" On Monday, the Gunners will have a tricky London Derby away to Crystal Palace, a team they drew 2-2 with in the last meeting. ""Yeah, [the last time we played them], we scored right at the end and it was a tough match,"" Arteta continued. ""We had some really good periods, some periods where we struggled. We conceded two very poor goals in that game with simple giveaways that put the game into a really difficult position.  ""The team, especially at home, is doing really well and the coaching staff are doing a great job and we know how it is to play in their stadium."" Arteta also reacted to Patrick Vieira's induction into the Hall of Fame after his fruitful years with Arsenal during his playing days. ""Well, it's a huge achievement. You have to be very special to be nominated to be there and I think Patrick deserves it for what he brought to the English game, what he did for Arsenal and what he brought to English football,"" he concluded.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/elneny-needs-arsenal-help-after-second-international/blt9685d65d5bac3060,Seth Willis,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2013,'I have a family' - Maguire opens up on bomb threat & tells angry Man Utd fans 'there's a line',"Harry Maguire has opened up on the bomb threat he received earlier this year while telling the angry Manchester United fans that have targeted him with boos and jeers that ""there's a line"". Maguire has endured a turbulent three years for club and country since joining Manchester United from Leicester for a world-record fee of £80 million ($101m). The defender has become something of a scapegoat for the Red Devil's failings, having been handed the captain's armband six months after his arrival at Old Trafford, and some have gone too far with their protests. Maguire was regularly booed by United fans in the second half of the 2021-22 campaign, which he accepted, but the situation escalated into dangerous territory when a bomb threat was sent to his family home on April 20. “There is a line,” the 29-year-old said of how he reacted. “We are human beings. I do have a family. People ask if it affects me. My mentality is that it doesn’t affect me too much but when it comes to bomb threats, it is more about family. “I’m just happy my kids are at an age where they don’t read things and see things on the news. If my kids were an older age, they could see things and go to school and people are speaking about it. That is when it affects you a little bit more."" Maguire added on his critics at United: “I’m in a position where I’m going to be criticised. Manchester United paid a large sum of money for me. It is one of the most loved clubs in the world and also one of the most hated in the world as well. “We know we are under the most scrutiny. I totally accept criticism when we concede goals or make mistakes. I’m big enough to accept people getting on my back and saying I can improve.” Maguire was speaking ahead of England's Nations League opener against Hungary on Saturday, which will mark his first international appearance since he was booed in a friendly against the Ivory Coast on March 29. “I have had amazing times with the [England] fans and I am not going to let the minority – I don’t know how many it was, 10-20 people doing that in the Ivory Coast game – affect my relationship with them,” he said when quizzed on the treatment from supporters. “I was a bit shocked. I wouldn’t say I was hurt and upset. I know my family and friends might have been affected by it but I was more surprised.” Maguire is hopeful that there won't be a repeat incident because he feels such behaviour has a negative impact on the next generation of Three Lions stars, but has also vowed to knuckle down and rediscover his best form. “There were a lot of young lads in the team that day, a lot of young people in the stands, lots of kids watching who aspire to grow up and be an England footballer, so for them to hear that for somebody who’s been involved in a such a big part of the journey over the last five years, it’s sad to see,"" he said. “It probably affects them [the young England players]. That’s why it was a little disappointing. We spoke about it as a group. But I’m sure there will be many good times ahead when the England fans will again show their support and love. “I am my biggest critic. Although there are a lot of critics out there, I’m actually still my biggest! The next biggest is probably my dad. “If that had happened earlier on in my career, I would’ve struggled that night. But I’m 29, I’ve been through a lot of ups and downs and I’ve learned to deal with it through experience. I’m sure I’ll be back to playing my best football very soon.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/i-have-a-family-maguire-opens-up-on-bomb-threat-angry-man/blt397b7a926c20aefd,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4705,When will the Premier League 2022-23 season start and finish? Teams and fixture release dates for new campaign,"The 2021-22 season was a thrilling affair in the Premier League, as the title race, top-four qualification scrap and relegation battle went down to the final day, and there promises to be more of the same in 2022-23. Big money will be invested during the summer transfer window, with eye-catching deals already in place, and a global audience will continue to be entertained by some of the finest talent on the planet in the English top-flight. There will be a few tweaks to the schedule in the upcoming campaign, as the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar are accommodated, but the end goal remains the same and GOAL brings you everything that you need to know about the new season. With a mid-season trip to Qatar, the 2022-23 Premier League season will start earlier than usual on August 6. To put that into context, the 2021-22 campaign got underway on August 13 when newly-promoted Brentford stunned Arsenal 2-0 in the Friday night curtain-raiser. Those players competing in the top tier this time around will get around two-and-a-half months off, although pre-season training and fixtures will be slotted into that break. Action will shut down on the weekend of November 12/13 ahead of the World Cup. The 2022 World Cup finals are due to run from November 21 to December 18. Anyone involved in that tournament will get a short break before Premier League action resumes on Boxing Day (December 26). From that point, the season will be played to a finish on May 28, 2023. All 10 matches on the final day of the season will, as always, be played simultaneously. Once again, 20 teams will compete in the 2022-23 Premier League season, with three promoted sides replacing those that suffered relegation. Fulham and Bournemouth are back in the big time after brief stints in the second tier and they will be joined by Nottingham Forest, the winners of the 2021-22 Championship play-off final.

1019,Man Utd-linked Gakpo responds to transfer talk after PSV's Champions League win over Monaco,"Manchester United-linked winger Cody Gakpo has responded to talk of a potential transfer away from PSV Eindhoven. The 23-year-old was an integral part of the PSV squad last season as he scored 12 goals and made 13 assists in 27 league appearances. Gapko's performances have propelled him to the limelight and he is now attracting attention from some of the top clubs across Europe, including United, who are reportedly in the market for reinforcements in attack.  However, Gakpo wants to play in the Champions League, a competition that United failed to qualify for in 2021-22.  PSV took a big step towards the group stage after beating Monaco 3-2 in the first leg of their third qualifying round tie on Tuesday, and the Dutchman addressed speculation over his future after the game. ""We must first focus on and try to make it to the Champions League,"" Gakpo told ESPN.  ""Then it is more likely that I will stay. I don't think I have said anywhere that I am leaving, so there is definitely a chance that I will stay.  ""I'm open for a cup of coffee with the management - or coffee for them and water for me. We'll see how it goes.""

4886,'Hopefully it won't be a burden for Salah to lose a second final' - Liverpool star sent Champions League warning by Real Madrid's Carvajal,"Real Madrid defender Dani Carvajal has stepped up the war of words with Liverpool ahead of their Champions League final meeting, warning Mohamed Salah about the “burden” of trying to seek revenge for their defeat in 2018. Much of the build-up to Saturday’s game has surrounded Salah and his determination to make amends for Liverpool’s 3-1 defeat to Los Blancos four years ago, when the Egyptian was forced off with a shoulder injury in the first half following a collision with Sergio Ramos. However, Carvajal has now suggested that Salah could be weighed down by the pressure of trying to avoid a repeat of that painful defeat in Kyiv. After Liverpool secured their place in the final earlier this month, Salah suggested revenge would be on his mind, though this was played down in a news conference earlier this week. Asked about Liverpool’s motivations for this weekend's game in Paris, Carvajal told ABC: “I don’t know if Salah or Liverpool are in the mood for revenge. “It is true that when you lose a Champions League final you always want to have a second chance against that same team in order to beat them. “Let’s hope it’s not an important burden for Salah to lose a second Champions League final against Real Madrid.” Real Madrid have had a tough run to the final, beating Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Manchester City on route to the French capital. Should they go on and lift the trophy, Carvajal admits it could be considered the club's greatest-ever achievement given the fact they had to come from behind in all three of their knockout ties. “It could be,” said Carvajal. ""This and the thirteenth [in 2018], which was PSG, Juventus, Bayern and Liverpool in the final. “But today given how football is, which is not 'you pay to win' but almost, perhaps this is more [impressive]. “Other leagues have a significant economic injection. So beating the two finalists from last year [Chelsea and Man City], and the PSG of [Kylian] Mbappe, [Lionel] Messi, Neymar and Ramos makes us grow and show the world what Madrid is and what this club means.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/burden-for-salah-liverpool-star-sent-champions-league/bltd1fc9e9a6adab3d2,Tom Mallows,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
809,"'Everybody wants to feel loved' - Pogba tells Juventus, PSG & Barcelona what he really wants amid free transfer battle","Paul Pogba has told reported suitors Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona what he really wants amid the ongoing free transfer battle for the departing Manchester United star. United have confirmed that Pogba will leave the club upon the expiration of his contract, bringing to an end his largely underwhelming second spell at Old Trafford. The Frenchman rejoined the Red Devils from Juve in a record deal back in 2016, but only managed to win the League Cup and Europa League while struggling for form and fitness on a consistent basis. GOAL has reported that Juve have offered Pogba the chance to return to Turin, while PSG and Barca are also reportedly keen on securing his services. The 29-year-old has outlined exactly what he is looking for from his next club in an interview with UNINTERRUPTED - the athlete empowerment brand founded by basketball legend Lebron James and American businessman Maverick Carter. “I just want the best for me, I’m thinking like putting everything together,"" said Pogba. ""Take my time and I’m just looking for the best. I just want to play football, be myself always and enjoy what I do.  ""I need to enjoy what I do because otherwise I cannot perform well. I don’t want to be thinking negative.  ""We can be losing games, losing trophies but you have to be happy where you are and enjoy yourself. That’s what I’m looking for."" Pogba was a divisive figure throughout his United career, with his commitment to the collective cause called into question due to his perceived love of the spotlight away from the pitch. The World Cup winner was even booed and told to ""f*ck off"" by a section of supporters during a 3-2 home win against Norwich last season, and he has now stressed the importance of feeling ""appreciated"" in order to perform at the highest possible level. ""As long as you click first of all with the team, the fans, with the club that knows you and loves you. When you're free mentally, you enjoy yourself and that's when you perform,"" Pogba added. ""Everyone wants to feel loved, everybody needs that, your soul needs that. Its always good to feel that the work you do is appreciated.  ""People around make a huge difference because they can cheer you up or bring you down.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/everybody-wants-to-feel-loved-pogba-juventus-psg-barcelona/bltaed6afa570789e49,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5180,Messi gets Covid-19: Argentine DJ denies infecting PSG star after being labelled 'murderer',"Argentine DJ Fer Palacio has denied accusations he infected Paris Saint-Germain superstar Lionel Messi with Covid-19 after being labelled a ""murderer"" on social media. PSG have confirmed Messi is one of four first-team players to have tested positive for coronavirus during the Christmas break, with the 34-year-old forced to extend his stay in his native Rosario as he follows self-isolation protocols. Messi attended a number of parties in Argentina over the festive period, including a New Year's Eve bash at which he invited Palacio to perform. Palacio posted a picture on Instagram posing with Messi at the party last week, with the caption: ""I got the greatest to dance. Thanks to all the Messi family for the invitation."" The 31-year-old has been subjected to abusive messages online following Messi's positive Covid-19 test, with it suggested he is the man responsible for the PSG forward's diagnosis. Palacio has come out to set the record straight while also providing video evidence of his own negative Covid-19 test. ""I am a trend on Twitter because Messi tested positive for Covid-19,"" he said on Instagram. ""They relate this to me saying that I infected him. They have even called me 'murderer.'  ""I have a lot of very bad private messages. Yesterday I got tested because I have to travel to Uruguay and I do not have Covid-19."" Messi will have to complete his period in quarantine and post a negative test before being cleared to return to France. As a result, the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner has been ruled out of PSG's Coupe de France round of 32 clash with Vannes on Monday night. Messi may also be unavailable for the Ligue 1 leaders' trip to Lyon on January 9, with head coach Mauricio Pochettino saying in his latest press conference: ""I don't know if he will be there against Lyon.

3702,Napoli president De Laurentiis vows not to sign any African players participating in AFCON,"Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis has claimed the Italian club will not sign African players unless they agree to a clause which will see them miss out on the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).  Napoli had to release Senegal defender Kalidou Koulibaly, who has now jumped ship to Chelsea, and Cameroon midfielder Andre Zambo Anguissa for several matches last season as they went to fulfil their international commitments with their respective countries.  De Laurentiis will now make the African players sign an undertaking that they will not participate in AFCON before they get to wear the blue jersey of Napoli.  ""I told them, lads, don't talk to me about Africans anymore!"" he said during Smart Talk on Wall Street Italia.  ""'I love them, but either they sign something confirming they'll back out of playing the Africa Cup of Nations, or otherwise between that tournament, the World Cup qualifiers in South America, these players are never available! ""We are the idiots who pay salaries only to send them all over the world playing for others.""  Napoli and Nigeria's Victor Oshimen did not travel to play in AFCON as the club announced that the Covid-19 virus would keep the forward away from action.  The AFCON takes place every two years but due to Covid-19, the 2021 edition of the tournament was postponed to 2022. Hence there will be back-to-back tournaments with the 2023 edition coming next January. Kalidou Koulibaly has hit back at De Laurentiis for his remarks.  ""As the captain of Senegal, I don't think it is the best way to speak. If that's what he thinks then it is up to him. I know everyone at Napoli and the supporters and I know they don't see it like this. The city is very respectful,"" the defender said. The Napoli official touched on another controversial nerve and mooted an idea of a European tournament with the top clubs from the top-five leagues instead of the existing structure of the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League. ""The five most important countries have to have their own tournament. Enough of these fake competitions like Champions, Europa, and Conference League, the latter is stupid,"" he said. ""They are abandoning it because the championship is phoney and no longer competitive. We want to talk about next season? They have signed an agreement to play a World Cup in Qatar in the winter. ""Qatar has the PSG that pays the big salaries because every minute it drives out the oil. The next will be a super great training championship, divided into two parts. ""The world of football cannot self manage because we do the puppet show for others. if we could play 100 games, it would be a happy ending for everyone and we (clubs) like cretins agree to that.""

7479,Verratti: Mbappe's PSG transfer exit reports have 'made me sick',"Marco Verratti joked that the constant speculation around Paris Saint-Germain team-mate Kylian Mbappe's future has made him ""sick"", as recent reports indicating the forward would depart to Real Madrid sent him into a tailspin. The French attacker can leave PSG for free at the end of the season and discussion about his future has hung over the 2021-22 campaign. GOAL confirmed this week that Mbappe has agreed to join Real Madrid at the end of the season, with an announcement to be made after the Champions League final. Verratti acknowledges that whatever choice Mbappe makes will be significant for PSG, but he gets annoyed by all the discussion surrounding the 23-year-old.   He told Le Parisien: “It will have an impact on the club, whatever his decision will be. He’s one of the best players on the planet right now so we all want him to stay here. But when I speak with him, it’s more just to have a laugh. ""In football, when you have something on your mind, if a decision is coming up, you don’t talk about it.  ""It’s his decision, and I’m waiting for it like you are.  ""When I was on my day off and I saw a notification saying that Kylian is in Madrid, it made me sick [laughs].  ""Even if afterwards he told me: 'Don’t worry, I was on holiday'. We’re all waiting to find out."" Asked if he gives Mbappe advice about his future, the midfielder said: ""No, because he knows what I think.  ""I wouldn’t be a good advisor, in any case not an objective one. I wouldn’t be thinking about his own good, but that of everyone here in Paris."" Tensions have been high at PSG this season after their last-16 elimination from the Champions League against Real Madrid. The French team's fans have jeered at the players in several occasions, aiming their anger at Lionel Messi and Neymar in particular. Verratti understands that the supporters are angry, but says games at Parc des Princes have started to feel like away matches due to the atmosphere. ""I don’t think their anger is just linked to results. The Madrid game was the eye-opener for all of that, but there were great expectations at the start of the season,"" he said. ""It was being said that [director] Leonardo and Nasser [Al-Khelaifi, president] had brought in big players, and now it’s their fault if we’re not winning? It’s too easy to say that. ""Supporters are allowed to whistle but not during a match. During the game, we are all together. Sometimes it feels like we’re not playing at home anymore.  ""It’s difficult to understand. We need the supporters, and there are other ways to get your anger across. We can talk, for example.  ""I have no issue with [talking to the fans]. If it’s a discussion like today, calm and respectful, then yes. ""I know that the fans spend a lot of money on season tickets and on away games. So they are allowed to clap or whistle at the end of games, but if we all want to grow together, we shouldn’t throw everything in the bin.  ""It’s hard to take, but we were knocked out by Real Madrid, who are a great team.  ""Imagine if we’d been knocked out by Villarreal like Bayern Munich were, we wouldn’t have made it out of the stadium!  ""We have to be united to reach our goal.

Burnley head into the final day of the season sitting 17th in the table, outside the drop zone on goal difference. The Clarets are in danger of falling into the Championship after six seasons in the top flight, and Barnes believes a number of officials will be happy to see them go if they fail to survive. ""I think in recent seasons people look at us and think we’re a hard team, being ugly,” said the forward. “No disrespect, I think people, even referees, want us gone from the league. That’s just another issue we have to overcome. We’ve just got to concentrate on the game ourselves.” Barnes was then asked if he feels Burnley are treated differently by referees because of their unattractive status, and he replied by pointing to the incident that saw him concede a penalty after being pulled up for a handball against Tottenham last week. “Of course they do,"" he said."" The whole situation when [Kevin Friend] goes to the screen at the weekend. [Tottenham] played on, they missed a great opportunity and everyone goes to set up for a goal-kick, but then there’s VAR, it’s like, ‘What?’ Then he’s smiling when he comes away and no one can speak to him."" Barnes added on a similar incident in their 1-1 draw with Aston Villa last time out: ""Even at Villa Park we can’t speak to [Paul Tierney]. Go and check the screen, that’s what it’s for. We just need consistency throughout the decisions.” Burnley are guaranteed to stay up if they win their final game against Newcastle at Turf Moor on Sunday. A loss or a draw would see them go down if Leeds beat Brentford, and Barnes is ready to give his all and try to end a frustrating campaign on a high. ""It [this season] has been very tough for me, probably one of the lowest points in my Burnley career,"" he said. ""I have waited for my chance and I have had that in the last few games.

10870,England U21 vs Spain U21: Prediction and Preview,"It’s the final of the UEFA European Under-21 Championship. Here’s our England vs Spain prediction and preview. An exciting UEFA European Under-21 Championship is ending with one of Europe’s heavyweights lined up to win it all in Georgia. Is U21 football coming home, or will Spain clinch the outright most wins at the tournament? They are level with Italy on five European U21 Championships, while England are looking to win their third, and first since 1984. The clash at Adjarabet Arena in Batumi will be the fifth time England and Spain have met at the U21 Euros, and the first since the 2011 group stage. England have won three and drawn one of the last four meetings (W3 D1), including winning both legs of the 1984 final (1-0 away and 2-1 at home). However, in all competitions, Spain have only lost one of their five matches against England at this level since the turn of the millennium (W2 D2). They lost all four meetings prior to 2000. Lee Carsley has impressed as England U21 manager since being appointed almost two years ago, winning 13 of 15 competitive matches (D1 L1), with his team scoring 36 goals and conceding just seven. His opposite number, Santi Denia, took over Spain U21s after Luis de la Fuente was promoted to managing the senior team following the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in December. Santi is unbeaten in eight games so far (W5 D3 – one win came after extra time). His Spain side have particularly impressed when it comes to high turnovers during this tournament, recording 51 so far, 14 more than any other team (France second with 37). Spain duo Abel Ruiz and Sergio Gómez (five each) are the two players with the most direct goal involvements at this year’s U21 Euros (three goals and two assists each) – the last player to record more than five at the tournament was Luca Waldschmidt of Germany in 2017 (eight). England have been trying to beat Spain at their own game already. Their 5.2 and Spain’s 5.1 are the highest passes per sequence averages at the tournament, while they also rank first and second for the most 10+ pass sequences in open play (Spain 114 and England 110). Santi named an unchanged line-up for the semi-final so may well go with the same again, though Carsley brought in Emile Smith Rowe and Cole Palmer to good effect in the last four. He will be without the injured Jacob Ramsey but could opt to recall Noni Madueke, who dropped to the bench against Israel. In their opening game of the 2011 tournament, Spain unsurprisingly dominated much of it. Their team included familiar names such as David de Gea, Thiago Alcântara, Javi Martínez, Ander Herrera and Juan Mata, with César Azpilicueta starting on the bench. An England side including Kyle Walker, Chris Smalling, Jordan Henderson, Danny Welbeck and Daniel Sturridge started well, but fell behind from a corner when Martínez flicked on for Herrera to score at the far post after just 13 minutes, though replays suggested the ball went in off his hand in the days before VAR. Spain had most of the play after that as they showed off their token patient passing approach, but Luis Milla’s side were unable to seal the win. Walker passed the ball into Welbeck, who turned and shot past De Gea with just two minutes left. Replays showed he was probably offside, so the controversial decisions at least evened themselves out. Spain went on to win the competition, beating Switzerland 2-0 in the final in Denmark, while Stuart Pearce’s England crashed out in the group stage after following up that draw with a 0-0 against Ukraine and a 2-1 defeat to Czech Republic. Both teams eased through to the final, with England beating Israel 3-0 thanks to goals from Morgan Gibbs-White, Cole Palmer and Cameron Archer and Spain thrashing Ukraine 5-1, with Abel Ruiz, Oihan Sancet, Antonio Blanco, Aimar Oroz and Sergio Gómez all finding the net. England haven’t conceded a single goal at the tournament. If they manage another clean sheet in the final, they will set a record for the most at an U21 Euros (six). There has been plenty of spreading the wealth at the other end as well. Five England players have been directly involved in three or more goals at the U21 Euros (Gibbs-White, Archer, Palmer, Anthony Gordon and Smith Rowe) – the joint-most from any team on record (since 2007), along with Spain in 2019. Carsley’s men beat Czech Republic, Israel and Germany in the group stage, before a 1-0 win over Portugal in the last eight was followed by that comfortable dismissal again of Israel. After wins over Romania and Croatia to start things off, Spain drew 2-2 with Ukraine before having to rely on extra time to get past Switzerland in the quarter-finals and then the win big against Ukraine. After an impressive season on loan at Brighton and Hove Albion, Levi Colwill is one of the most talked about centre-backs in European football. Chelsea apparently want to offer him a new deal to stay at Stamford Bridge and become a key member of Mauricio Pochettino’s side, while Brighton and others line up to try and tempt him away with a promise of regular starts. It’s clear to see why from his performances in this tournament too. Colwill has dominated at the back for England as he has helped his country keep the ball out of their net for the entire campaign. Of defenders to play at least three games at the tournament, only the Netherlands’ Jan Paul van Hecke (37.3) has averaged more forward passes per 90 minutes than former Brighton teammate Colwill’s 34.0, while only four defenders have bettered his 2.5 aerial duels won per 90. Not the scorer of the winning goal for Manchester City in the UEFA Champions League final last month but the attacking midfielder from Real Betis who has lit up the tournament for his country. In fairness, as with England, the secret to success for Santi’s side has been a team effort. No-one has particularly stood out over anyone else. You could make an argument for a number of players to have been their most important. A final is about key moments though, and Rodri has been making moments for Spain. You have to be a good player to keep Celta Vigo star Gabri Veiga out of the team, and Rodri’s 12 chances created at the tournament is more than any of his teammates, as is his three big chances created. Only Israel’s Oscar Gloukh (33) has attempted more than his 26 dribbles in Romania and Georgia, and the Spaniard boasts a better success rate of 57.7% to Gloukh’s 51.5%. Finals are so often close affairs, and that could very well be the case again here. According to our predictor, there is just 1% between the two teams, with England coming in slightly ahead at 35.5% to win in 90 minutes, while Spain are given a 34.5% chance. Due to that closeness, there is a relatively high 30% chance of this one going to extra time. England: James Trafford, Josh Griffiths, Carl Rushworth; Max Aarons, Luke Thomas, Levi Colwill, Taylor Harwood-Bellis, Jarrad Branthwaite, Charlie Cresswell, Ben Johnson; Oliver Skipp, Morgan Gibbs-White, Jacob Ramsey, James Garner, Curtis Jones, Tommy Doyle, Harvey Elliott, Cole Palmer, Angel Gomes, Noni Madueke; Cameron Archer, Emile Smith Rowe, Anthony Gordon. Spain: Arnau Tenas, Julen Agirrezabala, Leo Román; Victor Gómez, Juan Miranda, Hugo Guillamón, Jon Pacheco, Arnau Martinez, Aitor Paredes, Mario Gila, Sergio Gómez, Manu Sánchez; Antonio Blanco, Rodrigo Riquelme, Oihan Sancet, Rodri, Álex Baena, Gabri Veiga, Aimar Oroz, Adrián Bernabé; Abel Ruiz, Ander Barrenetxea, Sergio Camello.

2878,Van de Beek reveals his preferred position and is 'really happy' to finally play 90 minutes after loan move to Everton from Man Utd,"Manchester United loanee Donny van de Beek has revealed his preferred position while admitting that he is ""really happy"" to have finally played 90 minutes after his move to Everton. Van de Beek arrived at Goodison Park on loan shortly before the winter transfer deadline, with United happy to sanction his departure so that he can see more regular minutes. All eight of the Dutchman's Premier League appearances in the first half of the season came from the bench, but he has already taken in one start for the Toffees, producing an impressive display in a 3-0 victory against Leeds. New Everton boss Frank Lampard drafted Van de Beek into his line-up for the clash with the Whites after initially handing him his debut as a substitute in a 3-1 loss to Newcastle on February 8. The 24-year-old played in the centre of a midfield four alongside Allan and made a big contribution in both defence and attack after being trusted in the role he feels most comfortable. “I think I can play in different positions and I like to play in the Premier League as a number eight, box-to-box,” Van de Beek told Everton's official website. “The manager wants me to bring some quality with the ball, to link up in midfield. He expects a lot from me and I expect a lot from myself. I am really happy with the first two weeks."" The Netherlands international added on his performance against Leeds: “It was an amazing day and a good start for me. We played really well from the first minute to the end – and we really needed this. “I am really happy to play 90 minutes, but in the last 20 minutes I felt it was a long time ago that I played a full game and I was a little bit tired. “But now I can make steps. I think I can help the team but still there is space for improvement. “I was sharp, took many balls and made some good decisions on the ball – but I am always critical and always can do better."" Everton were able to convince United to sanction Van de Beek's temporary departure in January, but no buy option was included in the final deal. The former Ajax talisman signed a five-year contract when he swapped Johan Cruyff ArenA for Old Trafford in September 2020, and the Red Devils are not yet ready to cut their losses. Despite the fact Van de Beek has started only four Premier League games for United to date, interim boss Ralf Rangnick has hinted he still has a future at the club. ""In the end, it’s a question of competition,"" Ragnick told reporters when explaining Van de Beek's loan to Everton. ""Like Paul Pogba, I see him in the centre of midfield as one of the six or eight positions and we have quite a few other good players in those positions, therefore he didn’t get much game-time. ""But that doesn’t mean he’s not good enough for the Premier League or Manchester United.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/van-de-beek-preferred-position-really-happy-play-90-minutes-loan-/blt9d038937fffa764a,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

10532,The Players With the Most Free-Kick Goals in Champions League History,"Cristiano Ronaldo holds the record for the most free-kick goals in Champions League history with 12, but who else is in the top five? One of the questions Opta was able to answer after completing its project to add historical data to its archive for the whole of Europe’s premier competition was which player has scored the most free-kicks in UEFA Champions League history. Scoring direct from a free-kick seems to be a dying art. There were just three direct free-kick goals scored in the whole of the 2022-23 season, compared with six the year prior and nine the year before that. The last two seasons have seen around one of every 83 goals scored in the competition come from a direct free-kick, compared to a competition high in the 1998-99 season where one in 12 goals was scored directly from a dead-ball situation. As such, it’s no surprise that some familiar names from the past feature prominently among the players with the most Champions League free-kick goals.  However, despite his remarkable free-kick prowess from club and country, Lionel Messi doesn’t make the cut. But who does?  Whenever free-kick scorers are mentioned, David Beckham and Roberto Carlos inevitably spring to mind. Goals like Beckham for England against Greece or Roberto Carlos in the Le Tournoi against France are classics.  The two players might have scored more but had to share free-kick duties while playing for Real Madrid, not only between themselves but with other players like Luís Figo. Beckham scored his first Champions League free-kick in September 1998 against Barcelona, and the last of the midfielder’s five for Manchester United came against Real Madrid in April 2003. He added two more for the Spanish giants to bring his tally to seven in the competition. All seven of Roberto Carlos’ were for Real Madrid, but only one came after Beckham’s arrival at the Santiago Bernabéu. Brazil has produced many fine set-piece takers. Stars such as Rivelino, Zico, Didi, Pelé, Roberto Carlos and even goalkeepers like Rogério Ceni were known for their aptitude from dead-ball situations. The first ever free-kick goal in the Champions League was scored by another Brazilian, Romário, for PSV Eindhoven against FC Porto.  It’s no surprise therefore that three of the top six most prolific free-kick scorers are Brazilian, and Rivaldo earned his spot with eight free-kick goals in the Champions League. Rivaldo scored seven direct free-kicks in a span of three years for Barcelona from 1998 to 2001 and then added one more while playing for Olympiacos at Anfield in 2004. His strike that night looked set to send Liverpool out of the competition but was overshadowed by a late comeback and a stunning long-range effort by Steven Gerrard which sent the Reds through. They would famously go on to win the trophy in Istanbul against AC Milan. Rivaldo was also the first player to score two direct free-kicks in the same Champions League match when he netted two against AC Milan in October 2000. The game also equalled the record for the Champions League match with the most free-kick goals (three) as Demetrio Albertini also scored one for Milan. That has only happened on one other occasion in the competition, with the other instance being Dynamo Kyiv 3-3 Bayern Munich in April 1999. The top Brazilian free-kick taker in the Champions League is none other than free-kick specialist Juninho Pernambucano. He netted just 18 goals in the competition and 10 of those came from direct free-kicks while three more came from penalties, emphasising his speciality from dead balls. Four of his 18 goals came against Barcelona and two of those were via direct free-kicks, one of which was from 44 yards out! Lyon were a force to be reckoned with in the mid-2000s and in 2005-06 Juninho became the first player in Champions League history to score four direct free-kick goals in a single season. Only Willian for Chelsea in 2015-16 has managed to match that feat. Juninho is the only one of the top six players for most free-kick goals who did not win the Champions League at some point in his career. Alessandro Del Piero has held the record for the most direct free-kick goals for the longest period of time in the history of the competition. The Italian was the first player to reach three goals and four goals respectively, and apart from a brief period between 2000 and 2002 where Rivaldo was either the record holder or joint-record holder, Del Piero had the most free-kick goals until 2016. His favourite opponent in the competition was Real Madrid, and two of his five strikes against Los Blancos came from free-kicks; though he probably wishes he’d saved one for the Champions League final of 1998 where Madrid triumphed 1-0 against Juventus to make it back-to-back runners-up spots for the Bianconeri. Del Piero ended with three runners-up medals in the competition and is also runner-up in this list to… If you were asked to guess who’d scored the most free-kicks in Champions League history, Cristiano Ronaldo would probably be the top of your list. Ronaldo, who is the competition’s all-time leading goalscorer, equalled and then overhauled Del Piero’s record in 2016, and then didn’t manage another before his departure to Saudi Arabia. With the dearth of free-kick goals in the competition these days, it may be a record that never gets broken unless he makes a comeback and beats his own tally. The highest total of players currently playing in a Champions League side is Leroy Sané who has three to his name. Ronaldo netted two in a single game against FC Zürich in September 2009 and only Rivaldo (as mentioned above) and Neymar (against Crvena Zvezda in October 2018) have matched that achievement.  He is the master of late drama, scoring four of his 12 free-kicks in the 89th minute or later and it is a quirk of fate that his first and last direct free-kick goals in the Champions League both came against Sporting CP,  the club that gave him his professional breakthrough.

11730,Mitrović’s Historic Hunt For a Half-Century of Goals,"Like all great stories, this one begins with a dispute over Gala’s 1996 Eurodance hit ‘Freed from Desire’. In the latter half of the 2015-16 season, Will Grigg was very much “on fire” in the English third tier. The Wigan fans’ irritating ear-worm of a chant honouring the striker’s hot streak even went international as it got several airings at that summer’s Euros in France (despite Grigg pleasing French firefighters by not playing a single minute for Northern Ireland at the tournament). But Wigan fans didn’t invent the chant. Supporters of Sunderland and Stevenage have both staked a claim – although all that’s relevant to the matter at hand is that Newcastle fans were already bellowing out their own version. The player the Toon Army were boisterously serenading? Aleksandar Mitrović (‘Mitro’ for ease of lyrical adaptation) – whose return of nine goals in his first season at St. James’ Park hardly constituted an inferno. Fast-forward to 2022, though, and Mitrović is performing at the prolific peak of his powers for Fulham. The 27-year-old Serb – whose 90th-minute winner against Portugal in November secured his country’s spot at this year’s World Cup – is burning out of control, topping the Championship scoring charts with 28 goals – in just 26 games. Scoring at a rate of a goal every 81.04 minutes and playing an average of 87.26 minutes per game, Mitrović is currently on course to fall just one short of a 50-goal season. In any case, Guy Whittingham’s record for the most goals in a second-tier campaign during the Premier League era (42 for Portsmouth in 1992-93) looks highly likely to go, although George Camsell’s all-time record of 59 for Middlesbrough in 1926-27 is probably safe for another year. Mitrović has already found the net more times this season than the top scorer or scorers in 21 of the 29 second-tier seasons since 1992, one of which was himself with 26 in 2019-20 – when he beat Ollie Watkins, then of Brentford, to the Golden Boot on minutes per goal. Evidently, Mitrović has excelled in the Championship in the past – but what he’s doing at the moment is next-level excellence. Of his 94 league goals in English football, 28 have come this term. But where has this scintillating streak come from? Well, for starters, Fulham as a team are having a frankly ridiculous season on the goalscoring front. Marco Silva’s Championship leaders may have drawn 1-1 with mid-table Blackpool last time out, but they are averaging well over two goals per game – closer to three, in fact (2.64). In addition to a 5-1 thrashing of Huddersfield, they’ve scored four on four occasions, and struck six and seven twice each.  Last month saw Fulham put Reading to the sword in a 7-0 evisceration on the road, before going all WTA by recording back-to-back 6-2 home wins over Bristol City and Birmingham – Mitrović bagging a brace against Reading then going one better and hitting his third hat-trick of the season against Bristol City (only to draw a blank against Birmingham). No second-tier side had registered six or more goals in three straight league matches since Everton almost 68 years earlier. With a whopping 74 goals so far, Fulham are the Championship’s highest scorers by a country mile – from Blackburn on a comparatively paltry-looking 45. They’ve scored 70 non-penalty goals – 27 more than the next-best performers in that respect, QPR – and struck 53 times from open play, 18 more than Bournemouth behind them. If they continue at the same rate, Fulham will end the season with 122 goals, matching Middlesbrough’s second tier record from 1927. By most expected goals measures, Fulham are setting the standard and then some. In fact, just about the only attacking area in which they have not been untouchable is set-piece creativity — with their 14.7 xG from dead-ball situations ranking second to West Brom’s 17.3 (although they have still notched a league-high 14 set-piece goals). From his goals return alone, we can pretty safely surmise that Mitrović is being afforded five-star service, but in order to really understand his extraordinary exploits – and why he becomes a different proposition in the Championship – where, after registering only four goals in 25 appearances for Newcastle in 2016-17, he’s banged in a total of 56 in 83 for Fulham – we need to drill down a bit deeper. Last season, as Fulham finished 18th in the Premier League and were relegated for the second time in as many top-flight campaigns, Mitrović played 1,390 minutes and posted non-penalty xG figures of 6.18 at 0.3 per 90 minutes. In 2021-22, he’s more than doubled his NPxG output to a Championship-best 0.75 per 90 – having played 2,269 minutes so far. Of players to have featured for 900 minutes or more in the second tier this term, Bournemouth’s Dominic Solanke is the only one whose NPxG per 90 (0.71) comes within 0.1 of Mitrovic’s. Looking at chance quality, we can see that Mitrović’s average non-penalty shot in 2020-21 was worth 0.08 xG. The equivalent value this season stands at 0.17 – as with his NPxG per 90, an increase of more than 100%.  Is the Championship twice as easy as the Premier League? No. Many would argue, compellingly, that it’s one of the strongest 10 leagues in the world – but it stands to reason that a player seemingly ‘stuck in the gap’ between the two divisions will fare better at the lower level. That point is reinforced by the fact that Mitrović averaged 0.14 xG per non-penalty shot in his previous, 26-goal Championship campaign. Mitrović’s average chance quality is only fractionally up on 2019-20, then – so what’s the key to his success this time around? Well, it follows that if you’re having more of those good-quality chances, you’re probably going to score more goals… In 2019-20, Mitrović averaged 3.62 non-penalty shots per game as he ended the campaign on 146 non-penalty shots overall – the second-most in the league behind then-Brentford winger Saïd Benrahma on 173. Not even two-thirds of the way through 2021-22, he’s already had 111 non-penalty shots at a rate of 4.4 per 90. Silva’s devastatingly effective attacking set-up is playing right into his number nine’s hands (well, feet – and head, with which he’s nodded in eight of those 28 goals of his). Increasing his non-penalty shooting frequency by just over 20% relative to his last campaign at this level is one thing, but Mitrović has increased his non-penalty scoring frequency by more than 70%. Simply put, he’s taken his finishing to new heights. Mitrović has outperformed his xG in two of his previous six seasons in England. Unsurprisingly, he’s doing so again this term (28 goals from 22.9 xG), but he’s also doing something he’s never managed before: exceeding his xG with his expected goals on target – by 2.9, to be precise. That’s a higher shooting goals added than Robert Lewandowski this season (albeit not quite as high as half-man, half-ball launcher Erling Haaland).  Clearly, Mitrović is in the midst of a prolonged purple patch the like of which most strikers can only dream of. Can he sustain it? Absolutely. Will he sustain it? Very possibly. Will he finally make his mark on the top flight if Fulham go up? Maybe. But that last point is for another day. Next on the list of milestones for Mitrović? Reaching the 30-goal mark for the first time in his career. Then? Four more goals to bring up a century in English league football. And after that…? Another 13 to eclipse Guy Whittingham – and 14 to go down in Fulham history by breaking Frank ‘Bonzo’ Newton’s 90-year-old record for the most league goals in a single season for the Cottagers. Cracking the Premier League can wait.

8806,One underrated thing Leo Messi did in Super Bowl ad with Ted Lasso – spotted,"Lionel Messi just made a surprise appearance in a Super Bowl ad. For those of you're somehow unaware, the Super Bowl is an America's annual NFL bonanza, broadcasted in over 150 countries. Despite being called ""football"", the NFL involves more protective gear and a lot of hand action – quite different from what Leo and the rest of the world are used to.Apart from the game itself, the Super Bowl boasts a massive halftime show featuring huge music stars, and, of course, multi-million-dollar commercials. And the Argentine is set to appear in one of those, sharing the screen with Jason Sudeikis, aka Ted Lasso.Anyway, what's so special about? Did he finally break the language barrier and dazzle us with his impeccable English? Spoiler alert: he did not.There's one thing that flew under the radar, though: Messi didn't go for the goal but he went all generous and decided to assist it instead.Have a look.Here's what fans have to say about it:.UMAR: ""Did he just..assist it? Lol. My man doesn’t care anymore.""Badlikeme: ""Ronaldo would have scored that, but Leo doesn't care about the script.""Mk: ""Even in ads, he does all the work and serves up the assist.

3437,Phillips explains Manchester United transfer snub and reasons for £45m Man City move,"Kalvin Phillips has explained why a move to Manchester United was never going to happen for him, with the Manchester City new boy happy to have ended up on the other side of the city. A £45 million ($54m) transfer has taken the England international midfielder away from his roots at Leeds. Those ties to Elland Road ensured any interest shown from Old Trafford was always going to be snubbed, with the 26-year-old opting to link up with the reigning Premier League champions. Quizzed on whether the Red Devils stood any chance of securing his signature, Phillips said: “Going to United? There was never any chance of me going there. You know my loyalty to Leeds. My family are all Leeds fans. “I was honoured by Man Utd wanting me, one of the biggest teams in the world, but no, I had to stay loyal to Leeds and go to the other side of Manchester.” Pressed on whether that is an unusual stance, Phillips added: “I don't know, it's just the way I am, the way I think and the way I'll always be. “I want to be loyal to the people who've given me the biggest opportunity in the world. Leeds were the first team to sign me, I made sure that was one of the main things I'd do.” Kalvin Phillips joins Man City in a £45m deal as Pep Guardiola continues his rebuild 🤑 pic.twitter.com/uVU4qBCsrE A man who helped England to the final of the European Championships last summer saw his first minutes for Man City in their pre-season opener against Club America, as he came off the bench in a 2-1 win. Phillips said of his reasons for joining City: “It was the opportunity to be coached by Pep [Guardiola] even if it's just for a year or hopefully longer. “I know he's a great manager and he'll elevate my game to a level I want to be at, and be involved in teams fighting for trophies. “Also just be around players that make you a better player every single day. The opportunity I was given was one I couldn't turn down. Even if Pep's only here for one more year then it will hopefully be a good year.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/phillips-man-utd-transfer-man-city-leeds/blt6113627b9a270b87,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10979,Manchester United vs Chelsea: Prediction and Preview,"Thursday night sees a team slowly going in the right direction host a team that are free-falling the other way. Can Erik ten Hag’s side secure the point they need for Champions League football next season? Find out in our Manchester United vs Chelsea prediction and preview. Casemiro’s spectacular scissor kick in Manchester United’s 1-0 win at Bournemouth put his side just one point away from securing UEFA Champions League football for 2023-24. After a sixth-place finish last season and a subsequent UEFA Europa League journey that flamed out in Seville, a return to Europe’s premier competition would represent a job well done for Erik ten Hag. It would take a spectacular collapse for United to miss out on the top four – namely back-to-back home defeats – and presuming that doesn’t happen then Ten Hag would become just the third Dutch manager to finish in the top four of the Premier League, with the other two also doing so in their debut campaigns (Guus Hiddink 2008-09, Louis van Gaal 2014-15). This season has been one of progress at Old Trafford. If the Red Devils pick up at least two points in their last two games, they’ll register their highest points tally since 2017-18 (77 in José Mourinho’s second season in charge) and the EFL Cup win against Newcastle United in February was their first major trophy in six seasons. Given Man Utd’s exceptional league home record – they’ve lost just one of their last 26 home Premier League games (W18 D7) and are unbeaten in their last 16 at Old Trafford – you’d expect them to get the job done on Thursday. Especially given they host Chelsea, who just want their miserable season to end. Frank Lampard’s side are winless in their last 10 Premier League games against United (D7 L3) and could go 11 games without a win against them for the first time in their history. Regardless of what happens here, Chelsea have already registered their worst ever Premier League points tally. Even if they win their final two games of the season, they’ll end the 2022-23 campaign with 49 points, one fewer than in 1995-96 and 2015-16. Mauricio Pochettino will have a giant task on his hands, despite how well he’s suited to the role. Chelsea have had problems beating most sides this season, but they’ve had particular issues about beating the better sides in the division. Since the start of last season, Chelsea have won none of their 15 Premier League games against teams starting the day above them in the table (D4 L11), losing each of their last four. Chelsea have already lost nine Premier League away games this season, and should they lose here – as the supercomputer predicts – they’ll hit double figures for away defeats for the first time in a single season since 1997-98 (11). The previous meeting between these two sides predictably ended all square. In fact, each of the last five Premier League meetings between Man Utd and Chelsea have been draws. United made all the early running, with Luke Shaw fizzing an angled shot just wide of the post in the opening 10 minutes. United started very brightly and took six of the game’s first seven shots, with both Marcus Rashford and Antony closest to breaking the deadlock before half-time. The second half whizzed by with little interest, but just as it looked like the game was going to peter out into another draw, Scott McTominay was adjudged to have hauled down Armando Broja in the box from a corner. Jorginho stepped up, and with a hop, skip and a jump, had Chelsea 1-0 up with just four minutes left of normal time and the Blues were on course to win their first game against United in nine league attempts. That was until Casemiro rose highest from a Shaw cross to power an exceptional header across goal and past Kepa Arrizabalaga’s forlorn dive. It was the Brazilian’s first Premier League goal and was United’s latest equaliser in the league since April 2017 against Everton (93:41). Previous Meeting Lineups: Chelsea: Kepa, Thiago Silva, César Azpilicueta, Marc Cucurella, Trevor Chalobah, Ben Chilwell, Jorginho, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Mason Mount, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Raheem Sterling Manchester United: David De Gea, Raphaël Varane, Luke Shaw, Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martínez, Christian Eriksen, Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony Manchester United have responded to back-to-back 1-0 defeats to Brighton and West Ham – which opened the door briefly for Liverpool to entertain hopes of a Champions League spot – with wins at home to Wolves and away to Bournemouth. Granted, those two teams basically had nothing to play for after securing Premier League status, but United still had jobs to do. They won both games to nil and have kept a clean sheet in each of their last six Premier League home games. They last went longer without conceding at Old Trafford in the league in March 2010 (seven games). In all competitions, the Red Devils have recorded 16 shutouts at home in 2022-23, last keeping more in 2015-16 (17). Frank Lampard picked up his first win in his second spell as Chelsea manager against Bournemouth earlier this month, but Chelsea followed that up with a draw at home to Nottingham Forest before a 1-0 defeat away at Manchester City. That solitary win is their only victory in their last 12 competitive matches and came after a run of six consecutive defeats. Chelsea’s recent form is as bad as their season form and the Blues are now just limping towards the end of a torrid campaign. After another injury-plagued season, Anthony Martial has slowly worked his way back into Ten Hag’s squad as United’s campaign reaches its conclusion. Rashford has missed the last two games through a combination of injury and illness, though Ten Hag suggested he may return for this one. Despite that, Martial’s form could see him handed a third consecutive start. Ten Hag would likely be happy to keep the Frenchman in. Martial enjoys playing against Chelsea – having been involved in five goals in his last four starts against the Blues (four goals, one assist). Argentine metronome under Argentine manager? It makes a lot of sense. Pochettino loves his players to be able to progress play vertically and in Enzo Fernández he will have the perfect playmaker assuming the former Tottenham boss indeed arrives ahead of next season. Enzo’s 5.6 progressive passes per 90 is the fifth best of any Premier League player this season, while his 79.4 passes per game is the highest of any midfielder. He is extremely active defensively, too, ranking in the 88th percentile for tackles (2.96 per 90) and in the 92nd for blocks (1.77 per 90) when comparing him to midfielders across Europe’s top five leagues. Fernandez is always looking forward and could be the bedrock of this Chelsea midfield for the next decade. Opta’s supercomputer believes this one could be closer than most would anticipate. Whether it’s the nerves of the hosts about finding that final point or the determination to stay up that surely will have to come from the Foxes before it’s too late, this might be a somewhat even contest. Newcastle are still favourites to win their final home game of the season, with a 42% chance of success, but Leicester are considered to have a 30.3% chance of earning what would be a massive three points. The draw comes in at a 27.7% possibility, which would be a better point for Newcastle than Leicester, but whatever happens on Monday, Smith’s side will still have an opportunity to stay up on the final day of the season. Our season simulator gives them a 13.9% chance of saving themselves, while the Magpies have just a 0.8% chance of somehow messing up Champions League qualification from here.

6530,Afcon 2021: Caf fines Egypt heavily for dishonouring media protocols,"Egypt senior national team has been fined by the Confederation of African football for dishonouring media protocols at the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. The North African country was fined the sum of 100 000 USD for failing to honour a press conference before their quarter-final match against Morocco. Caf announced this development via a statement on their website, stating that the Pharaohs were clamped down because their act was against the ‘obligations for all the participating teams.’ “The Caf Disciplinary Board has imposed a fine of 100 000 USD, with 50 000 suspended, to the Egypt Football Association (EFA) for breaching Caf Total Energies Africa Cup of Nations Cameroon 2021 media protocols and directives,” the statement read. “This is after Egypt FA failed to honour a media press conference on 29 January 2022 ahead of their match against Morocco in the TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals in Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium which is part of the obligations for all the participating teams. “Media and Caf Rights Holders had waited almost two hours for Egypt to arrive for the scheduled press conference.

10375,Fulham vs Wolves: Prediction and Preview,"We look ahead to Monday’s game at Craven Cottage with our Fulham vs Wolves prediction and preview. Can the goal-shy hosts finally find their shooting boots? Fulham didn’t have to worry too much about goals last season, with the since-departed Aleksandar Mitrović recording a career-high 14 Premier League strikes as Marco Silva’s men secured a top-half finish. Things have been more difficult in 2023-24, however, and their lack of cutting edge has some fans worried about a potential relegation battle ahead of Monday’s visit of Wolves. While Fulham emerged from the international break seven points clear of the relegation zone after Everton’s 10-point deduction saw them drop below Silva’s men, they are winless in four Premier League games following their 3-1 defeat at Aston Villa last time out (D1 L3), with only Burnley (nine) scoring fewer goals than their 10 across the first 12 matchdays of the season. Antonee Robinson’s own goal set the tone at Villa Park as Fulham went 3-0 down before Raúl Jiménez finally got off the mark for the club with a second-half consolation. Jiménez will hope that goal – his first in the Premier League since netting for Wolves in a 4-0 win over Watford in March 2022 – came at the right time ahead of his first meeting with his former club. Only three players have ever scored against Wolves in the Premier League after representing them in the competition: Andrew Surman in December 2011, Keith Andrews in February 2012 and Diogo Jota in March 2021. Jiménez will compete with Carlos Vinícius for a place in Fulham’s lineup, with fellow striker Rodrigo Muniz likely to return from a knee injury in early December. Another former Wolves man, winger Adama Traoré, joined Kenny Tete in returning to the squad against Villa and should be involved. Fulham suffered a real blow when João Palhinha received his fifth booking of the season on Matchday 12, meaning he will serve a one-match ban on Monday. Palhinha led all Premier League players for tackles attempted (52) and was second only to Pedro Porro for tackles won (25 to 27) ahead of this weekend’s fixtures. He was a big miss for Fulham when out with a shoulder injury earlier in the campaign. Fulham have lost four of the five Premier League games in which he hasn’t appeared since his arrival from Sporting CP last year, conceding an average of three goals per game when he is absent (15 in five), compared to 1.3 when he is involved (58 in 45). Wolves have not shared Fulham’s goalscoring woes this season, with Gary O’Neil’s men netting in 11 straight Premier League games since their 1-0 defeat to Manchester United on Matchday 1. It’s their longest scoring streak in the competition since a run of 18 between August and December 2019. Their Matchday 12 win over Tottenham was surely the high point of O’Neil’s time at the club, surpassing even the 2-1 victory over Manchester City in September. Stoppage-time goals from Pablo Sarabia and Mario Lemina saw Wolves snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, with Spurs’ unbroken 87-minute lead the longest in Premier League history by a team who eventually lost. While O’Neil would probably prefer not to leave things so late on Monday, Wolves have repeatedly shown an ability to dig deep. Only Arsenal and Liverpool (both seven) scored more goals in the final 10 minutes of Premier League games than Wolves’ six across the first 12 matchdays, while Wolves’ three winning goals in that timeframe are the most in the division, with each coming in the 86th minute or later. Sarabia was the hero last time out, recording a goal and an assist to match his goal involvement figures from his previous 18 games in the Premier League. Prior to that win, Sarabia’s only goal in the competition came against Fulham in February, and with Pedro Neto still sidelined by a hamstring injury, the Spaniard will hope he has done enough to earn a start. O’Neil will have to make at least one change, with Craig Dawson suspended after accumulating five yellow cards. Matt Doherty and Santiago Bueno are among the options to replace him, and both will be available after suffering knocks over the last fortnight. Nelson Semedo is also expected to start after recovering from a foot injury. Wolves are unbeaten in their six Premier League meetings with Fulham since the two teams won promotion from the Championship together in 2018, recording three wins and three draws. Indeed, Fulham have only won one of their last 14 league games against Wolves (D4 L9), a 2-0 home win in the Championship in February 2018 with Ryan Sessegnon and Mitrović on target. Both games between the teams last season finished level. Manor Solomon cancelled out Sarabia’s opener as they drew 1-1 at Craven Cottage in February, after José Sá saved a late Mitrović penalty in a goalless draw at Molineux last August. Neutrals will be hoping Monday’s game bucks the trend of low-scoring contests between these sides, with just seven goals being scored in their last six Premier League meetings. Wolves have scored five of those goals with Fulham netting two, and neither team has scored more than once in any of those matches. Fulham have alternated between losing (three) and winning (two) in their five home Premier League games this season, and they’ll be hoping that pattern continues after going down 1-0 to Manchester United last time out at Craven Cottage. Their last eight home league defeats have come against sides from either London (five) or Manchester (three). However, they must overcome a bout of the Monday Blues this time, having lost their last six Premier League matches to take place on a Monday night (7:45pm kick-offs or later), failing to score in five. Their last such victory came by a 4-1 scoreline against Crystal Palace in October 2013. Wolves’ last away game ended in a 2-1 defeat at Sheffield United, with Oliver Norwood scoring a stoppage-time penalty after Fábio Silva was judged to have fouled George Baldock. They have two wins from six Premier League road trips under O’Neil, beating Everton (1-0) and Bournemouth (2-1). The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off on Monday, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Monday’s game appears a difficult one to call, and that can be seen in the Opta supercomputer’s prediction. Fulham are narrow favourites, winning 38.6% of the supercomputer’s pre-match simulations, with Wolves winning 31.3% and 30.1% finishing level. The supercomputer is predicting both teams to finish securely in mid-table, with Wolves given just a 0.7% likelihood of relegation and Fulham having a 2.3% chance. Thirteenth (18.3%) is Wolves’ most common position in our season simulations, with Fulham finishing 14th (19.2%) most often. Enjoy this?

10943,Serie A Team of the Season: OptaPaolo’s 2022-23 XI,"Who makes the Serie A Team of the Season based on Opta Data? The 2022-23 Serie A season is finally over, with Napoli winning the title for the first time since 1989-90 to send their hardcore fanbase in Naples delirious. In truth, most felt that they’d wrapped up the title long before they did on 4 May, with last season’s champions Milan struggling to keep pace with them and other top sides like rivals Internazionale and Lazio. Those four teams made up the UCL qualification spots, while Atalanta and Roma qualified for next season’s Europa League, helped by Juventus’ points deduction which saw them end in seventh place. Looking back at the star performers across the top flight campaign in Italy, our esteemed data insights team at OptaPaolo have provided their data-driven team of the 2022-23 Serie A season. Ivan Provedel enjoyed a brilliant first season at Lazio following his summer move from Spezia, with the goalkeeper helping the Rome-based side to a second-place finish in Serie A – their best league finish since winning the title in 1999-00. It came as no shock when he won the official Serie A goalkeeper of the year award at the end of the campaign. The Italian shot-stopper kept 21 clean sheets overall in 2022-23, at least five more than any other goalkeeper in Serie A, while among all goalkeepers to have played at least 15 matches across the campaign, he had the best save ratio (77%). Of first choice goalkeepers across the season, only Luigi Sepe (4.5) had a higher goals prevented total than Provedel (3.6) based on Opta’s xGOT model – another reason his strong season earns him a place in the OptaPaolo Serie A Team of the Season for 2022-23. Of all the players in our OptaPaolo Serie A Team of the Season for 2022-23, Carlos Augusto is probably the inclusion you would have least expected at the start of the campaign. But he enjoyed a brilliant season at Monza, who finished 2022-23 in 11th place after only winning promotion to Serie A for the first time last term. Left-back Augusto was a serious goal threat all season, with the most goal involvements across all defenders in 2022-23 (11), thanks to his six goals and five assists at Monza. No Serie A defender scored more goals than he did in 2022-23 (level with Stefan Posch), while his tally was the most by a defender for a newly-promoted Serie A side since Maurizio Domizzi for Napoli in 2007-08 (eight). One of the biggest success stories of the 2022-23 Serie A season, South Korean central defender Kim Min-jae joins teammate Di Lorenzo in our TOTS defence. Physically imposing with his sturdy frame and 6-foot-3 height, he arrived from Turkish club Fenerbahçe in the summer without much fanfare only to become a fan favourite in Naples by the end of the title-winning season. Strong in the air – he was one of just eight defenders to win at least 63% of aerial duels (of those to be involved in 100+) – but equally as comfortable with the ball at his feet, the 26-year-old won the official Serie A ‘Defender of the Year’ award for his performances. He was the defender with the most touches (3,173) and passes completed (2,547) in Serie A across the season, while among defenders with at least 30 appearances in Serie A this term, he had the highest successful passing rate (91%). He was hard to beat, too. Of defenders with at least 35 appearances across the big five European Leagues in 2022-23, Kim saw opponents dribble past him least often (five times). Roma may have had a disappointing end to the 2022-23 season, missing out on UEFA Champions League qualification spots in Serie A and losing the UEFA Europa League final to Sevilla, but Chris Smalling can certainly be happy with his performances on a personal level. Of the 123 Serie A defenders to engage in at least 100 duels across the season, none had a duel success rate higher than Smalling’s 69%. He was also a player keen to throw his body on the line to protect the goal, with his 36 blocks only beaten by Sebastiano Luperto’s 42 (in four games more) across the Italian top-flight in 2022-23. Just eight opponents managed to pass Smalling with a dribble in Serie A this season – the only defender to play at least 2,500 minutes of action and let fewer players pass them in this manner was TOTS partner Kim (five). Despite this, Smalling played fair – he committed just 18 fouls across the campaign, which was the lowest tally of any Serie A central defender to play at least 2,500 minutes. Right-back Giovanni Di Lorenzo is the first of five Napoli players to make the OptaPaolo Serie A team of the season. No player from the club played more league minutes than he did across their Scudetto-winning campaign (3,257), while no defender played more Serie A games than he did across 2022-23 (37). Di Lorenzo created 45 open play chances for teammates across the season, which no defender in Serie A could surpass, while only Inter duo Federico Dimarco and Denzel Dumfries (both 4.5) were the only defenders with a higher open play xG assisted total than the Napoli full back (4.3). Always looking to play the ball into advanced areas, Di Lorenzo led the league for progressive open play passes (191), while the 29-year-old also chipped in with three non-penalty goals from 13 shots on target. Serbian international Sergej Milinkovic-Savic was a key player in Lazio’s second-place finish in Serie A this season. His 17 goal involvements were a joint team high alongside striker Ciro Immobile, with his nine goals and eight assists helping him surpass the 100-goal involvement tally in his Serie A career. Since his debut in Serie A, the only midfielders to be involved in more goals across the competition than Milinkovic-Savic (102) are Josip Iličić (107) and Papu Gómez (103). No player in the Lazio squad was as heavily involved in their open play attacking sequences across 2022-23 than Milinkovic-Savic (149), with his tally being surpassed by just nine players across the entire league in the campaign. A lot of Milinkovic-Savic’s threat comes aerially, with him winning more aerial duels (96) than any other midfielder in the Italian top-flight across 2022-23 and also having the most headed shots among these players (16). In fact, since his debut season in 2015-16, no player has scored more headed goals in Serie A than the Lazio midfielder (17). Stanislav Lobotka is a key cog in the well-oiled midfield machine at Serie A champions Napoli. Both the midfielder to complete the most open play passes (2,116) and the one to receive the second-most (1,790), he is the heartbeat in the middle of the Napoli side. Not a primary chance creator in open play (only 16 all season), a lot of his work goes unnoticed as it comes in deeper-lying positions on the pitch – only Inter midfielder Nicolò Barella (41) created more secondary chances than the Slovakian (34) in 2022-23, while no player in the competition won possession to start open play sequences that eventually led to a shot for their side than him (15). He doesn’t appear high for goals or assists from midfield, but Lobotka’s best work is done in deeper areas – without him, his more creative teammates can’t shine. Of the 149 open play attacking sequence involvements he had in 2022-23, 122 of those saw his only involvement in the build-up to a shot – not the chance created or the shot – this was a league-high tally and 27 more than any other player. Nicolò Barella enjoyed another fruitful campaign with 2023 UEFA Champions League finalists Inter, despite the Nerazzurri only finishing third in Serie A. Overall, Barella was heavily involved in everything Inter did well. Only two players – teammate Lautaro Martínez (181) and Napoli’s Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (193) – were involved in more shot-ending sequences in open play across 2022-23 in Serie A than him (170), while he also totalled the most secondary chances created in the league (41). He was one of just five midfielders to score at least six goals and deliver at least six assists in Serie A this season, while he also created 53 chances for teammates in open play – a tally only beaten by Nikola Vlašić (58) among midfielders. His six goals were as many as he scored in 2020-21 and 2021-22 combined. Inter forward Lautaro Martínez ended the season with 21 league goals, finishing behind only Napoli’s Victor Osimhen in the scoring charts. That tally equalled his personal record for Serie A goals in a season (level with last season), while he also assisted six goals for teammates, level with his previous best set in 2020-21. In fact, across the top five European leagues, Martínez is only of just four players to have scored 20+ goals in both campaigns alongside Erling Haaland, Robert Lewandowski and Kylian Mbappé. His attacking contribution of 5.9 non-penalty shots and open play chances created was the highest in Serie A across 2022-23, just ahead of Udinese’s Gerard Deulofeu (who spent half the season out with injury). His goals were important to Inter, too. In total, his 21 strikes were worth 15 points to the club in Serie A this season – only M’Bala Nzola (16) won more for his team in 2022-23. No Serie A team of the season would be complete without a star striker. Napoli’s Victor Osimhen is just that. In finishing the season with 26 goals, he won the top scorer award in Serie A while becoming the first African player to reach this tally in an Italian top-flight campaign. Ten of those goals were openers, helping Napoli get off to a good start in games on the way to winning their first Scudetto since 1990. He became just one of only four Napoli players to score at least 26 goals in a Serie A season, after Edinson Cavani (26 in 2010-11 and 29 in 2012-13), Gonzalo Higuaín (36 in 2015-16) and Dries Mertens (28 in 2016-17), while no Serie A player with five or more goals in 2022-23 could better his minutes per goal ratio of 99. With strong rumours of other top European clubs on the hunt for the Nigerian striker this summer, Napoli will have to stand firm to keep their superstar for another year. The average football fan might have been forgiven for not being aware of Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s talents this time last year. Having left Rubin Kazan after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he returned to his home nation Georgia to play for top-flight club Dinamo Batumi. Napoli then snapped him up in July for a reported fee of just €10m. We had the foresight to include him in our Analyst 50 for players to watch in 2022-23, and he did us proud. With 12 goals and 10 assists, he became the first player to reach double figures in both metrics in his first-ever top-flight season within the top five European leagues since Diego in 2006-07 at Werder Bremen. He was an absolute menace when running at opposition defenders. Only Rafael Leão (79) completed more dribbles than Kvaratskhelia (76) in Serie A 2022-23, while he created the most chances (26) and assisted the most goals (five) from carries in the competition on the way to winning the Scudetto. It’s been a long time coming for Luciano Spalletti, but the Scudetto is finally his. After 554 games in Serie A as a manager, he finally won the title. In doing so, he gave Napoli their first Serie A crown since 1990. He became the oldest coach to lift the Serie A trophy, when on 4 May (when they finally won the league), he was aged 64 years and 58 days old. That championship came with five matchdays left to spare – which is the earliest ever, but in truth it probably should have come sooner. Come the end of 2022-23, his Napoli side won the title by a gap of 16 points – the joint fourth highest points gap between first and second place in the history of the competition.

The 18-year-old, known for his technical skills, started his journey with City's Academy at the age of nine.After a standout 2022/23 season, where Harrison played a key role in securing the Under-18s Premier League title for City's youngsters, he's carried that momentum into this season.

7891,"Real Sociedad manager assesses Mikel Oyarzabal fitness, PSG and Luis Enrique","Real Sociedad manager Imanol Alguacil has declared that captain Mikel Oyarzabal could return in time for their clash with Paris Saint-Germain. The Basque forward is facing a late fitness test to see if he will be fit for the first leg in Paris.  The Txuri-Urdin will be desperate to have their leader back for a clash which sees them in their worst moment of form. La Real have not scored in their last four matches, and have recorded just one league win in their last nine. â[PSG] have a great team, with a squad, with a great coach and, no doubt many of them are thinking that if La Real have a great day, they could even surprise us,â Imanol Alguacil told Cadena Cope ahead of the game. If Oyarzabal is not fit, then Takefusa Kubo and Ander Barrenetxea are likely to  be playing off one of Umar Sadiq or Andre Silva. Alguacil spoke highly of Luis Enrique, calling him their âMbappe on the benchâ. âThere is no doubt that PSG has a squad to be a finalist and with a coach who also knows us very well, whom I admire a lot. I know that he is a coach who likes to push high and who likes to take the initiative, which which we like to do too.â The big question mark for La Real is whether forward and captain Mikel Oyarzabal will be fit, as he tries to race back following a muscle injury. âIf you asked me the question after training, I could no doubt answer betterâ¦ Well, tomorrow we will no longer have any doubts.â âIf he has traveled it is because he has a chance. Yesterday he was able to do a bit more, today he will no doubt do a little more than that. It will depend on how it evolves and, if there is any game in which you have to put all your effort in, it will be tomorrowâs. Thatâs what I can tell you.â Real Sociedad will need to rise to the occasion againt PSG. During the group stage, La Real had the best defence in the competition, conceding just twice and going unbeaten in a group that featured finalists last year Inter. The sense is that an unreliable PSG and the Txuri-Urdin have been in different directions of travel since though. Ahead of the match Luis Enrique praised their good work and their use of academy players.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Real-Sociedad-manager-assesses-Mikel-Oyarzabal-fitness-PSG-and-Luis-Enrique/3301689,,2 days ago,all-football-app
6083,"Gallagher is the only one to lose from Chelsea's decision to not let on-loan Crystal Palace midfielder play in FA Cup semi-final, says Vieira","Patrick Vieira has expressed his belief that Conor Gallagher is the ""only one who will lose"" as a result of Chelsea's decision to prevent the on-loan Crystal Palace midfielder to play in their FA Cup semi-final. Palace and Chelsea are due to face off for a place in the FA Cup final in a London derby clash at Wembley on April 17. The Eagles sent a request to Chelsea for Gallagher to be allowed special dispensation to play, despite current FA rules preventing loan players from featuring against their parent clubs, which was denied last week. The terms of Gallagher's loan deal also stipulate that he cannot line up against Chelsea, but they could have given the green light for changes to be made. Vieira cannot understand why they didn't, because the midfielder will now miss out on the chance to play in one of the biggest games on the domestic calendar, which he feels would have been a deserved reward for his performances throughout the 2021-22 campaign. “It’s not the best rule because the only one who will lose is Conor,"" the Palace boss said in his latest press conference. ""There’s a semi-final, it’s a really exciting game about how you will manage yourself and prepare yourself to play that game, then there’s playing that kind of game and the importance of it. “It’s an experience the player is missing and I’m disappointed for him. He has played all the games so far and if there’s somebody who deserves to be in the semi-final, it’s him because of his performances, so I’m disappointed he won’t be able to play. “The decision for Chelsea to send him on loan is to play these kind of games. We have as a group an opportunity to play an important game and that game would have given him more confidence and belief. We could lose but for him to have been on the field is what he needs to keep developing himself.  ""Since he has been with us, he has been fantastic and for him not to have a chance to get involved in that game, it is something frustrating for his development. I feel for him because he wanted to play in that game — every player would want to play in that game.” Gallagher has recorded eight goals and five assists in 31 appearances across all competitions for Palace since joining the club on loan from Chelsea last July. The 22-year-old has also broken into the England national team, but Vieira says he hasn't been his usual self since the draw for the FA Cup semi-final was made. ""The next day in training he was affected by that,"" the Frenchman added. ""He knew straightaway that it was a game that he would not have the chance to get involved in. We feel for him. ""He put his head back into training straight away. It will be more difficult when we enter the week of the game. ""It will be challenging for him, looking at the team, preparing himself and him not getting involved. That will be challenging for him.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/gallagher-is-the-only-one-to-lose-from-chelsea-s-decision-to-not-/blt8faad00def9ddfd0,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11322,Japan vs. Costa Rica: Prediction and Preview,"We preview the 2022 World Cup match between Japan and Costa Rica, including our pre-match prediction for each team’s second game in Group E. You must allow functional cookies to continue. Costa Rica coach Luis Fernando Suarez will be hoping his direct approach pays off when his side take on Japan on Sunday. Spain thrashed Costa Rica 7-0 on Wednesday, in one of the standout results of the World Cup’s early games. Costa Rica conceded as many goals in that match as they had across their previous eight games at the tournament combined. They also failed to have a single shot against Spain today, just the second instance of a side failing to have an attempt on goal in a World Cup match since 1966, after Costa Rica themselves against Brazil in 1990. 0 – Costa Rica failed to have a single shot against Spain today, just the second instance of a side failing to have an attempt on goal in a World Cup match since 1966, after Costa Rica themselves against Brazil in 1990. Shy. pic.twitter.com/FOeZi81viq Japan, meanwhile, shocked Germany by winning 2-1 in the other Group E game. Costa Rica have never beaten Japan, losing three of their four previous meetings. Asked what his side needed to do to address their defeat against Spain, Suarez’s message was simple. He told reporters: “I’ll have to be very direct – we did a lot wrong, we made mistakes, and I think we should all be very clear about what our mistakes have been, starting with myself, my tactical responsibility. “When we’ve done all this, we have to forget about the result. It will be very difficult. But we do have players who are good enough to play differently. “We have to improve a great deal. We need to take on that responsibility and the blame, but also the way to move on is by focusing on positive results and to forget about [the Spain] defeat.” Suarez did, feel, however, that even though his side underperformed against Spain, the result was a harsh reflection of their display. “Spain were the much better team. But this was one of those games where everything happened in a completely different way than what you’d expect,” he added. “Yes, they were much better, but not by a difference of seven goals.” After beating Germany, Japan are looking to win back-to-back World Cup matches for the first time since 2002 (versus Russia and Tunisia), while they have never won both of their first two fixtures of a single edition at the finals. Indeed, victory on Sunday for Japan could see them through to the last 16, should Germany fail to beat Spain. Takuma Asano scored a brilliant winner against Germany, sealing a famous victory for Japan. Asano had five of Japan’s 12 shots in the match – no other player had more than one. Only Shinji Kagawa has ever had more attempts in a single World Cup match for Japan (six vs. Colombia in 2014). Keylor Navas has been one of Europe’s best goalkeepers over much of the past decade, but he had a shocker against Spain. The Paris Saint-Germain shot-stopper will be determined to right those wrongs and help Costa Rica claim a clean sheet as the basis for a win to keep their hopes alive. He is one of three Costa Rica players who could make their 10th World Cup appearance, along with Celso Borges and Bryan Ruiz. Costa Rica’s heavy defeat to Spain means they have been given just a 13.4% chance of winning this game by Opta. The likelihood of a Japan victory is rated at 66.6%, with a 20% chance of a draw.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2022/11/japan-vs-costa-rica-prediction-preview-world-cup/,Patric Ridge,27/11/2022 2:57,the-analyst
10030,Paris Saint-Germain vs Real Sociedad: Prediction and Preview,"Having fallen at this point several times before, Luis Enrique’s men return to the UEFA Champions League knockout stage on Wednesday. We look ahead to Paris Saint-Germain vs Real Sociedad with our prediction and preview. Paris Saint-Germain must banish their UEFA Champions League last-16 demons if Luis Enrique’s side are to deliver their main ambition of European success, starting with the first leg of their round-of-16 tie against Real Sociedad at Parc des Princes on Wednesday. Paris, the so-called city of love, will fittingly play host to the European encounter on Valentine’s Day, though the mood in the French capital could quickly turn to misery if the Ligue 1 giants fall short of expectations yet again in the first knockout round of the Champions League. After defeat to Bayern Munich in the 2020 final and being eliminated by Manchester City in the 2021 semi-finals, PSG have been not made it past the round-of-16 stage in either of the last two seasons of UEFA’s premier club competition. A woeful second-leg collapse against Real Madrid proved their undoing in 2021-22 before falling to Bayern once again in 2022-23. Luis Enrique’s team almost missed out on last-16 qualification entirely this time around, failing to win any of their last three group games as they drew with Borussia Dortmund and Newcastle United after losing 2-1 away to Milan in early November. Somehow, PSG still scraped through Group F in second place, overcoming Stefano Pioli’s Rossoneri by virtue of their favourable head-to-head record. It could have been so different, with Luis Enrique’s future at the club most likely in danger if Milan had lost at Newcastle on the final group-stage matchday. Now, the French champions must look to capitalise on their good fortune. They’ll fancy their chances against Real Sociedad come Wednesday’s kick-off despite their three-game winless run in the Champions League being their longest in one campaign since going five without a win between Matchday 6 and the quarter-finals in 2014-15 (D2 L3). The success of PSG may be influenced by the likes of Ousmane Dembélé, Achraf Hakimi and Marquinhos – as well as teenage star Warren Zaïre-Emery – but the burden will largely fall on Real Madrid target Kylian Mbappé. The France star has scored 43 goals in 67 appearances in the Champions League and, should he find the net in this game, he will overtake Raúl (43) for the second-most goals scored in the competition while 25 or under, with only Lionel Messi (59) netting more. As for team news, PSG will be without the injured Nuno Mendes, Layvin Kurzawa, Presnel Kimpembe, Milan Skriniar and backup goalkeeper Sergio Rico. They used their 3-1 victory over Lille on Saturday to rest Mbappé, Gianluigi Donnarumma and Marquinhos, with the trio all expected to return for Wednesday’s game. While PSG’s hopes mainly rest on French superstar Mbappé, La Real have also relied on their own countrymen, with all seven of their goals in the Champions League this season scored by Spanish players. Brais Méndez (3), Mikel Oyarzabal (2), Mikel Merino and Ander Barrenetxea (both one) helped propel them to the Champions League knockouts for the first time since 2003-04. Back then, La Real were eliminated by Lyon after making the last 16 in what was their first and only previous appearance in the Champions League knockouts before this season. Their performance in the group stage may provide Imanol Alguacil’s men with the belief they can pull off an upset against PSG. They went unbeaten to top Group D ahead of Inter after two wins over Benfica, victory over Red Bull Salzburg and three draws. Their success was at least partly down to their bold and aggressive approach off the ball, with no side making more high turnovers than their 70 in the competition this term, while only PSG have a lower PPDA average (opposition passes per defensive action) than Alguacil’s team (9.6), which highlights how high up the pitch they press teams. However, Alguacil may be without a few key figures from his lineup on Wednesday. Oyarzabal, Sheraldo Becker, Álvaro Odriozola, Kieran Tierney, Aihen Muñoz and Carlos Fernández all missed Saturday’s 1-0 defeat to Osasuna in La Liga. Club captain Oyarzabal was the biggest miss and remains a doubt for Wednesday, though Hamari Traoré and Takefusa Kubo have both started since their respective returns from the Africa Cup of Nations and Asian Cup. Aritz Elustondo is suspended. This is the first ever competitive meeting between PSG and La Real, though the Ligue 1 club have been eliminated on five of the last six occasions they’ve faced Spanish opposition in the Champions League knockout rounds. PSG’s only success against teams from Spain came when eliminating Barcelona in the 2020-21 round of 16, with Mbappé’s hat-trick inspiring a 4-1 first-leg victory that teed up their 5-2 aggregate triumph in March 2021. The France forward is the last player to manage a treble against a Spanish side in the knockout stages of the competition and has netted in each of his last five Champions League matches with La Liga teams, scoring seven times. While PSG have struggled against Spanish opposition in recent years, La Real have also lost three of their six meetings with French opponents in all competitions (W2 D1), while they’ve lost both such games in the Champions League – going down 1-0 in both legs of a last-16 tie against Lyon in 2003-04. Real Sociedad kept more clean sheets (four), conceded fewer goals (two) and faced fewer shots on target (12) than any other side in this year’s Champions League group stage. Alguacil’s side may have fended off Inter, Salzburg and Benfica but their form has not translated to La Liga, where they sit seventh in the league table, 11 points adrift of fourth-placed Atlético Madrid and qualification for next season’s Champions League. Unlike Wednesday’s visitors, PSG are – unsurprisingly – cruising at the Ligue 1 summit, sitting 11 points clear of second-placed Nice as the French champions appear set to defend their title with ease. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off on Wednesday, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides: Despite Real Sociedad’s commendable performance in the group stage, the Opta supercomputer sees PSG as considerable favourites for this one, with the Parisians winning 55% of the 10,000 pre-match simulations. Nevertheless, the prediction model calculates a reasonable possibility that La Real take a positive result back to Anoeta, doing so in 45% of the simulations, odds that Alguacil will presumably like the look of. An away win is rated as having a 21.3% probability, and what a boost that would be for Real Sociedad if they’re able to pull it off. PSG struggled their way out of the group stage but their chances of winning the competition have risen to 6.4% in the Opta supercomputer’s season projections. That makes Luis Enrique’s side sixth favourites behind Inter, Arsenal, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Manchester City. PSG progressed to the quarter-finals in 64.5% of the last-16 simulations, making La Real big underdogs for this tie. Paris Saint-Germain: Keylor Navas, Alexandre Letellier, Arnau Tenas, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Achraf Hakimi, Presnel Kimpembe, Marquinhos, Lucas Hernández, Nuno Mendes, Nordi Mukiele, Lucas Beraldo, Milan Skriniar, Manuel Ugarte, Fabián Ruiz, Danilo, Vitinha, Lee Kang-in, Warren Zaïre-Emery, Ethan Mbappé, Senny Mayulu, Kylian Mbappé, Gonçalo Ramos, Ousmane Dembélé, Marco Asensio, Randal Kolo Muani, Bradley Barcola.

6823,Why Man Utd picked Ten Hag over Pochettino to be their new manager,"In the end, it came down to two choices for Manchester United: Mauricio Pochettino or Erik ten Hag? The well-known former Premier League manager against the ‘mysterious’ Dutchman who has transformed Ajax over the last few years.  It took just one round of formal interviews for Ten Hag to emerge as the leading candidate, as he impressed John Murtough and Darren Fletcher with his plan for putting United back on top and Pochettino, who had led the managerial hunt process for a while, was pushed into second place.  Originally, there had been four candidates on the shortlist to replace interim manager Ralf Rangnick, with Sevilla boss Julen Lopetegui and Spain national team manager Luis Enrique also in contention. Thomas Tuchel, Carlo Ancelotti and others were considered but never as concrete options due to various obstacles.  However, by the beginning of April, four had become one, with the United hierarchy having settled on Ten Hag, whose appointment was confirmed on Thursday morning. It is understood that the 52-year-old made quite the impression when Murtough and Fletcher flew to Amsterdam to conduct the formal interview.  The pair, who led the process, were struck by his passion, energy and enthusiasm for the huge challenge which is getting United competing for major honours again. OFFICIAL: Manchester United confirm Erik ten Hag as their next manager 🔴 pic.twitter.com/pJFKinQtSu His no-nonsense approach to management was also evident as he clearly pointed out departments and other areas within the club that need to be improved.  This week it was confirmed that two heads of United’s scouting system, Marcel Bout and Jim Lawlor, will be leaving the club at the end of the season after eight and 16 years of service, respectively.  While sources say those decisions are not down to Ten Hag, they are the first departures of what is set to be a busy summer of restructuring and rebuilding at Old Trafford. And it’s not just club staff that will be at risk – the squad needs a big clear-out too.  The players’ preferred choice was Pochettino, with some senior players believing they would thrive under the guidance of the former Spurs boss.  However, sources say Ten Hag was the ""unanimous choice"" with the board after the interview process and despite what some of the players thought, they believe he has the capability and vision required for the next stage of the rebuild.  Richard Arnold, the club’s new chief executive, met with Ten Hag after his formal interview to give his stamp of approval and while Rangnick insists he was not part of the decision-making process, the German was asked for his opinion in the recruitment meetings he was involved in.  Club sources say Ten Hag was the candidate who was ""most closely aligned with the club’s identity and strategy"" and his commitment to improving and developing young players was also considered a major plus. His attack-minded playing style also appealed. The Dutchman has spoken openly about his admiration for Pep Guardiola, admitting that the Manchester City boss has influenced his footballing philosophy. While sources dispute the claim that financial factors played a part in Ten Hag's appointment, it was appealing to United that they would only have to pay Ajax £1.6 million ($2m) in compensation fees, given it would have been far more expensive to have prised Pochettino away from Paris Saint-Germain. Meanwhile, the timing of the appointment has been key for those involved in the recruitment process, with sources revealing that United were determined to have a deal agreed with their new manager before the end of the season. GOAL understands that the club have been pushing ahead with their usual transfer process and have shortlisted players for each of the priority positions.  A central midfielder, striker and defender are on the shopping list and Ten Hag will be able to make a decision on the chosen targets while also presenting his own options.  Still, this is an appointment that carries some risk. For all the clamour and excitement surrounding the imminent arrival of Ten Hag, he has never previously worked in the Premier League, unlike Pochettino.  However, club sources believe that his other attributes are strong enough to ensure that his lack of experience in England will not be an issue.  Murtough said: “In our conversations with Erik leading up to this appointment, we were deeply impressed with his long-term vision for returning Manchester United to the level we want to be competing at, and his drive and determination to achieve that.” Only time will tell if he is capable of getting United out of their current mess, but the belief is that there is no better man for the job right now.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-man-utd-picked-ten-hag-over-pochettino-new-manager/blt8d448c41282193f2,Charlotte Duncker,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

7448,Ghana's Mensah: After facing Messi I want to see what Ronaldo can do at World Cup,"Ghana defender Gideon Mensah is excited by the prospect of meeting Manchester United ace Cristiano Ronaldo when Ghana face Portugal at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Otto Addo’s side have been drawn against Fernando Santos’ outfit for what will be like a re-match of their encounter at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Eight years ago, Ronaldo made his presence felt in the showdown, scoring the match winner in the 80th minute after Asamoah Gyan netted to cancel out John Boye’s own goal for the Selecao. “Facing Ronaldo is something I look forward to. I [have not met] him at the club side but now I have the chance to meet him in the World Cup which is the highest stage,” Mensah, who featured in both games as Ghana beat Nigeria in the play-offs to qualify for the World Cup, told Joy Sports. “I know I will have to do my thing and defend him [Ronaldo], so I have to make it look like this is a game for me. “When I played against [Lionel] Messi, it was difficult because he is something else. He [Messi] gave me pain in my waist after one turn in Paris but I am waiting to see what Ronaldo will try and do to me.  “Maybe it could be what I will do to Ronaldo instead, I will make sure I make him [Ronaldo] run.” Uruguay and South Korea are Ghana’s other group members for the November 21-December 18 tournament. Black Stars assistant coach Mas-Ud Didi Dramani is unfazed by their tricky draw on their return to the global gathering following their absence in 2018. ""We never expected anything less than this. Whatever it is, we expected to be drawn against other tough opponents apart from African teams,"" Dramani told Graphic Sports. ""I think the most important thing is planning and preparation. There are no minnows in football anymore. ""What is required to ensure success is the right personnel and a good strategy.” Ghana are set to take on Portugal in their opening game of the World Cup at Doha’s Stadium 974 on December 24.

8369,Lazio 1-0 Bayern Munich: Ciro Immobile puts Italians ahead in Champions League last-16 tie as Dayot Upamecano sees red,"Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane has called on his side to keep fighting after Ciro Immobile's penalty gave Lazio a 1-0 win in the first leg of their last-16 tie in Rome. Immobile converted his 69th-minute spot-kick after Bayern defender Dayot Upamecano's clumsy challenge on Gustav Isaksen for which the France international was sent off with a straight red card. Disciplined Lazio stifled the German side's attacks and Bayern were toothless throughout, failing to register a single effort on target in the game. Bayern, who also lost at the weekend to Bundesliga title rivals Bayer Leverkusen, now have work to do if they are to reach the Champions League quarter-finals and Kane says it is up to the players to turn around their stuttering form. Kane told TNT Sports: ""Really tough week. In the first half, we started well and had clear chances, one for myself. In these games, they're big moments. ""The second half was disappointing. We came out with less energy and less confidence. We got punished. Once you go down to 10 men it's always difficult. ""We have to find it among ourselves. We're still in the race for the Bundesliga and still in this tie. We have to keep fighting. How the teams lined up Champions League fixtures Champions League results Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp! ""We're in a difficult spell. We have to fight. We have to turn it around. We have big games and big things to fight for. We're not out of it, we will never give up. We just need to turn it around. One game or spark can turn it around."" The Bavarians were desperate to bounce back from Saturday's 3-0 Bundesliga loss to leaders Bayer Leverkusen which left them five points off the top, but they will return to Munich with more pressure piling on head coach Thomas Tuchel after his side's second straight defeat. Bayern have also now failed to score in their last two games but Tuchel, who struggled to explain his side's worrying form, played down concerns about his position after the match. ""Worried about my future? No, I am not,"" he said. ""We're frustrated and angry about the defeat. I think we lost the game, I'm not sure Lazio won it. ""I'm not sure why we lost our conviction in the second half, but we did, and then we fell behind. I can't explain it because we told the team to maintain their intensity and be even braver going forward, but we seemed to lose face at the start of the half. ""There are things we can build on. In the first half, we created some good chances, some big chances and one huge one with Jamal (Musiala), but in the end, we didn't have a single shot on target, so it's clear you can't win a game like that. ""But we've got a second leg and, obviously in conjunction with the last result, it doesn't look great, but we'll keep working hard."" Soon after the match, Bayern Munich issued a statement to ""strongly condemn"" racist abuse aimed at defender Dayot Upamecano on social media following his red card.


""FC Bayern strongly condemn the racist comments being directed towards Dayot Upamecano on social media,"" the club said.


""Anyone who comments hateful words such as these is no fan of our club. We’re all behind you, Upa!"" Bayern started well as they pressed the Italians high and created chances for Joshua Kimmich, Harry Kane and Leroy Sane in the first half, who all narrowly missed the target. Lazio, who had lost 6-2 on aggregate to Bayern at this stage three years ago, went close with a Luis Alberto shot that flew wide of Manuel Neuer's goal. The tempo gradually dropped, Bayern struggled with the disciplined Italian back line and had to wait until the 40th minute to threaten again with Jamal Musiala firing over the bar from close range. Lazio should have taken the lead two minutes after the restart when Isaksen only had Neuer to beat but the goalkeeper stood his ground to block his shot. The Dane earned a penalty when Immobile passed to Isaksen in the box and Upamecano arrived late and stepped on his ankle. Immobile kept his cool and sent Neuer the wrong way to give his team the advantage going into the return leg in Munich on March 5. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Former England defender Danny Mills on Sky Sports News: ""Lazio came out even more determined in the second half. They were so dogged in their defending, and were very well organised. Bayern are just lacking something - that No 8 or No 10 to create chances and do something a little bit different in those tight areas against compact defences. ""Harry Kane was pretty much anonymous in the second half. One free-kick he had hit the top of the wall and went over - that was it. Immobile's penalty was very calm under pressure. I'm not convinced it's a red card for Upamecano, but it is a penalty. He's a fraction late and he ends up landing on Isaksen's ankle. ""Lazio will be absolutely delighted but Thomas Tuchel will be under severe pressure. At Bayern Munich, you are expected to win. Lazio outworked them in the second half and it's going to be a tough game in Munich."" Lazio face a crunch game in the race for Europe with fifth-placed Bologna on Sunday, kick-off 11.30am.

185,'A top 10 life moment' - Ryan Reynolds loves incredible 30-yard chip from Mullin as Wrexham reach Wembley cup final,"Hollywood star and Wrexham co-owner Ryan Reynolds experienced a ""top 10 life moment"" when he saw his side secure a place in the FA Trophy final. The actor was stunned by an incredible lob from outside the box by Wrexham star Paul Mullin which gave the Welsh team the lead in the semi-final against Stockport on Saturday. Mullin struck twice in stoppage time in the second half to send the National League team through to the final at Wembley, and Reynolds made him go viral by sharing his opener on Twitter. Seeing this in person was a top ten life moment for me. Thank you, @Wrexham_AFC https://t.co/IlIPDwos5V Wrexham posted the video on their official Twitter account and Reynolds shared it with the caption: ""Seeing this in person was a top ten life moment for me. Thank you."" Mullin has been amazed by the reaction his goal has received since Reynolds made his post, telling BBC Radio Wales: ""With Ryan and Rob [McElhenney, fellow owner] involved with the club it's always a bit hectic around us. ""But at the weekend, that goal's gone viral and Ryan's putting it everywhere. ""My phone's not stopped doing backflips and I've had to put it on sleep mode to get some sleep. ""But it's surreal sometimes the type of attention that the Hollywood superstars bring to the club and the area, highlighting a lot of things in Wales and Wrexham. ""It's good to see and all the fans are on a high at the moment."" He added: ""He said he'd never experienced anything like it and I often say to him that football gives you every emotion and it's impossible to describe how it makes you feel. ""I think Saturday gave him the feelings that he probably hadn't experienced before in life."" Wrexham will meet National League team Bromley in the FA Trophy final at Wembley on May 22, and Reynolds says he will be there to see his side on the big stage. He told BBC Sport: ""I got in at eight this morning, seven this morning, and I'll be home by eight, 10 tonight, to New York. It's a bit of a commute but, man, was that worth it. I'll take anything, that was really exciting.""  ""Oh, I wouldn't miss [the final]. Are you kidding me? Wembley, that's once in a lifetime.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/top-10-life-moment-ryan-reynolds-incredible-30-yard-chip/blt8393a64671d5b74e,By Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

180,Manchester City training Ukrainian refugee footballer who fled Moscow following Russian invasion,"Manchester City are helping to train a Ukrainian refugee footballer who fled Moscow following the Russian invasion of his homeland.  Andrii Kravchuk, who is a former youth team-mate of City defender Oleksandr Zinchenko, was playing for Torpedo Moscow in the Russian second tier when his homeland was invaded.  The 23-year-old has been offered the chance to train with the club’s elite development squad to maintain his form and fitness after his contract was terminated.  Kravchuk was on a pre-season training camp in Turkey when he received a call at 5am from his mother that Russia had started bombing Ukraine.  His family have remained in the capital Kyiv, with his brother fighting alongside his country’s armed forces.  He fled to Manchester and has been allowed to train with City following approval from the UK government, the Football Association and the Premier League.  The former Ukraine under-17 and under-21 international took part in his first training session at City’s Etihad Campus on Thursday.  “I am so grateful to Manchester City for giving me this chance to train with them,” he said. ""I haven’t seen Oleks for a while but he has always been helpful for me – even going back to when we were together at Shakhtar. We’ve had a chat and I’m really happy to be here with him. “The past few weeks and months have been so difficult, but to be back on the pitch means so much to me. ""There were nice people around me at the club but I was playing in a country that invaded my homeland. Leaving the club was the only decision. People in Ukraine would not understand me if I continued to play there."" Kravchuk first met the Ukraine captain when they were aged 11 and 13 at Shakhtar Donetsk’s youth academy more than a decade ago.  “While I wish the circumstances were very different, it has been good to be back with Andrii,” Zinchenko said.  “I know how much football means to him, and how it can help us during these difficult times. I would like to thank my club for giving him the opportunity to train with us.”  Zinchenko, who has been given warm support across football, has spoken about how he has struggled to comprehend the invasion and how he wishes he was able to return to his country to aid in the fight.

11095,Happy Hatters: Luton’s Quest to Go From Non-League to Premier League,"I’m a Watford season ticket holder of 25 years. There, I said it. With that in mind, writing a positive data analysis of what makes Luton Town’s crop of 2022-23 so good is something that’ll undoubtedly make me a pariah to many Watford fans in a normal week (sorry dad), let alone in the week leading up to a crucial M1 derby match at Kenilworth Road. But the fact is, this Luton team are very effective. Not just that, they are one of the strongest Championship teams of the season – arguably the best if you were to generate a club ‘resources to points won’ calculation. If you’d have told a fan of either club at the start of the season that Watford’s newly appointed manager would be in charge of Luton a month before Christmas, nobody would have believed you. But it’s happened and Rob Edwards is proving his old club wrong as he sends Luton soaring up the table. Here’s how he’s doing it. There really isn’t much love lost between Luton and rivals Watford, so for a manager to cross the divide (albeit after being sacked by the other) is very rare and usually unwise. So far though, it’s a move that has worked wonders for Rob Edwards. Edwards was picked as the man to lead Watford into a new era – a young, progressive head coach who would be backed ‘come hell or high water,’ but it turned out that hell and high water came quicker than expected at Vicarage Road and the panicked board dismissed him after just 10 league games in charge and three wins on the board. In truth, the partnership rapidly looked incompatible, and it was best for both parties to split. The former Welsh international was picked by the Hornets following a fantastic season at Forest Green Rovers, where he won the League Two title and was named the 2021–22 EFL League Two Manager of the Season. At the Gloucestershire club, Edwards embedded a fast, dynamic style that produced outstanding results for a team that weren’t expected to be challenging for promotion. Now he’s doing the same at Luton. Replacing Nathan Jones was always going to be a difficult act. Jones had made Luton a force to be reckoned with, getting them promoted from League Two in his first full season at the club and getting the club in a great position to get promoted from League One before moving to Stoke City in January 2019. After things didn’t work out at the Potters, he returned 16 months later, saved them from relegation and eventually led Luton to the Championship play-offs last season, where they lost to Huddersfield in the semis. Their rise to the play-offs was massively unexpected, considering Luton had (and still have) one of the most modest budgets in the second-tier. So called ‘smaller’ clubs have got the Championship play-offs before but have never been able to sustain their promotion challenge over more than a single campaign – Barnsley are a case in point going from fifth in 2020-21 to bottom the subsequent year. After Jones was plucked from Kenilworth Road to begin his disastrous 14-game tenure at Southampton, Luton were quick to appoint Edwards following his departure from Watford seven weeks earlier. They haven’t looked back. Since he arrived at the club on 17 November, Luton have picked up 34 points in 17 matches at a rate of two points per game. Only runaway leaders Burnley (42) and automatic promotion-chasing Middlesbrough (40) have won more points across this period, while he’s improved on Jones’ start to 2022-23 (1.47 ppg). By installing a familiar style from his Forest Green season – which he was hamstrung from embedding at Watford – Edwards has made Luton serious contenders for promotion to the Premier League this season. Luton don’t rely on having possession, it’s not a hugely important point to their gameplan. Overall, this season their average possession figure in the Championship is 44.8%, which 18th-lowest out of the 24 clubs. It’s been slightly higher under Edwards (46.7%) than it was under Jones (42.7%) this season, but keeping the ball isn’t vital to Luton. Getting the ball into the final third of the pitch is much more important. Field tilt is a metric to show the territorial dominance between teams. Put simply, it measures the share of possession a team has in a game, considering only touches or passes in the attacking third. It can be useful when trying to understand which team is more dominant in games, rather than looking at overall possession, mainly as it looks at how teams are able to get the ball into areas that matter. Under Edwards, Luton are one of only four Championship sides to have averaged less possession than their opponents but have a field tilt percentage higher than the opposition (52.8%). Essentially a philosophy of not keeping possession for the sake of it deeper on the pitch, but quickly getting in areas that can harm the opposition. Luton average just 2.6 open-play sequences per game of 10 or more passes in the Championship during Edwards’ tenure, which is only higher than three sides – Blackpool (1.5), Birmingham (1.9) and Rotherham (2.0), all three of which are in the bottom eight of the Championship table. Compare this to the only two teams above Luton in the table since Edwards came into the club – Burnley (17.3) and Middlesbrough (12.4) – and it shows how dramatically different methods can produce league points. Getting the ball into the final third of the pitch without taking many passes to do so isn’t anything new, and Watford fans certainly can’t accuse Luton of having an ugly style of play – their best ever manager in our best ever era gleaned success from these methods, after all. Luton haven’t been as direct under Edwards as they were under Jones in 2022-23, but Luton are still one of the most direct and fast-paced sides in the Championship this season. The Hatters still average under 2.5 passes per open-play sequence of play under their new boss, but they have become less direct in the speed at which these sequences are launched upfield. Since Edwards was appointed, Luton are one of only six teams to have played over 20% of their passes long (30 yards or more), while only Rotherham (43.8%) have seen a higher proportion of their open-play passes end in the attacking third of the pitch than they have (39.7%). Their strikers are the usual target of these, with only Andry Carroll and Tom Bradshaw being involved in more aerial duels per 90 among forwards in the Championship since Edwards came in on 17 November than Carlton Morris (8.8) and Elijah Adebayo (8.9). Once the ball is in the attacking half of the pitch, Luton want to keep it there, even if they don’t have possession of it. Under Edwards, Luton have the third lowest PPDA of 10.0 behind only Burnley (9.7) and Stoke (9.3) – PPDA totals the opposition passes allowed per defensive action outside of the team’s defensive third – while they also have the third most high turnovers in the Championship (151) across this period. Both are decent proxies for showing how intense a team presses in the attacking half of the pitch. Of these high turnovers, the majority of the ball-winning is done by their hard-working central midfielders. Sixty five of the 151 (43%) have been made by the quartet of Jordan Clark, Allan Campbell, Pelly-Ruddock Mpanzu and Marvelous Nakamba. Under Edwards, no players have averaged more touches per 90 minutes at Luton Town than their wing-backs, Alfie Doughty (68.3) and Cody Drameh (67.6), while those two are also the only Hatters’ players to average at least 40 touches in the opposition half. On average, both players have over 60% of their touches in the opposition half – Doughty (64.4%) and Drameh (60.6%). Luton suffered a blow with influential right-back James Bree’s departure to Southampton to join up with Jones in January, but as expected with Luton’s sharp player recruitment team, they quickly found an ideal replacement in Leeds’ loanee Drameh just three days later. Since Drameh’s debut on 31 January, the only two players to have reached double figures for chances created in the Championship at Luton are the 21-year-old right wing-back (13) and his left-sided team-mate Doughty (13), while across the whole season, Bree (0.28), Drameh (0.23) and Doughty (0.20) top the Luton leaderboards for xG assisted in the Championship. Looking at Luton’s passing networks from their most recent two Championship home games against Swansea and Bristol City, the importance of their two wing-backs in building passing sequence chains is clear to see. In the two 1-0 wins, Morris grabbed the winner in both games – the goal against Swansea from a driven Doughty cross, the winner against Bristol City a header from a fantastic Drameh cross. Getting the ball out wide for crossing opportunities is key to Edwards’ system at Luton. Since his appointment, only two teams have found a team-mate with more open-play crosses than Luton (51) in the Championship, while their total of 28 chances created from open play crosses is the fourth-highest. And their crossing threat isn’t just limited to open play. Luton’s players have combined for the highest xG assisted total of any side in the Championship from both corners (5.0) and in-direct free kicks (2.8) in 2022-23 overall. Despite that obvious threat, their tally of eight goals from these set pieces – four corners and four from in-direct free kicks – is the third lowest in the Championship, while just two goals have been scored directly via pass or cross from those methods this season, and never from a corner, which may come as a surprise to Luton fans… or not. Q: When are we going to score from a corner!?RE: There is a lot of work that goes into set-pieces so we are hoping that very soon we will score from one. We practice them hard so hopefully it is coming soon! For Luton, why wouldn’t you get the ball out wide and generate open-play crossing opportunities when you have a two-man attack formed of Morris and Adebayo…? Ask most Championship defenders which forwards they wouldn’t be looking forward to playing against at the weekend and there’s a fair chance that Morris and Adebayo would be regular mentions. Both are strong and aerially dominant strikers that can bully opposition defenders, but are also intelligent at finding space inside the box to maximise scoring opportunities. Their role in the team hasn’t differed too much between Jones and Edwards, although since the new manager came into the club, both strikers have seen more of the ball outside of the box than under Jones – Morris’ % of touches inside the box has fallen to 11.1% from 13.9% and Adebayo’s 16.5% to 12.3%. But this hasn’t affected their goal outputs, with both averaging a better minutes per goal ratio under Edwards. Despite that drop, both Morris and Adebayo are strikers who thrive on receiving the ball inside the 18-yard box. Of players to have played at least 1,500 minutes of Championship football this season, Adebayo averages the fifth-most touches inside the opposition box per 90 (5.7) and Morris the sixth-most (5.4). Both rarely get involved in the build-up to their own shots, too. Of Morris’ 75 open-play shot attempts, just five have seen him also involved in the move building up to the shot, while Adebayo’s 62 open-play shots have seen him involved in the sequence build-up just three times. Of the eight combined occasions that they have been involved in the build-up to one of their own goals, all eight have been quick one-twos with a team-mate. Another example of Luton’s excellent recruitment, Morris joined from relegated Barnsley in the summer for a reported fee of just £1.8m. He’s already repaid Luton with a seasonal career-best 16 goals in league competition, equalling Adebayo’s Championship tally from last season at the club. He needs just four more goals in the Championship this season to become the first Luton player to reach 20 league goals in a second-tier campaign since Brian Stein in 1981-82 (21), a year in which the Hatters won the title and secured a spot in the top-flight. Both Adebayo and Morris were quite very quiet in Watford’s 4-0 rout of Luton earlier this season when Jones was still in charge of the club, attempting just three shots and one on target between them. With Edwards looking to prove Watford wrong and Luton hurt from that thrashing in October, there’s little chance they’ll be as quiet on 1 April.   Luton Town have never been a Premier League club, and should they end up being promoted this season, they’d be the first team to play in the non-league and work their way up to the top-flight in the Premier League era. Of course, football began before the invention of the Premier League and Luton know that better than anyone, as they were relegated from the top-flight the season before in 1991-92.  With the Bedfordshire club in such a rich vein of form with only eight games left to play before the play-offs, there’s every chance that the side with the smallest budget in the league could show the richer owners how it can be done sustainably.

5105,'I miss the Champions League' - Liverpool-linked Neves admits to seeking transfer away from Wolves this summer,"WHAT HAPPENED? The Portuguese midfielder has spent the last five seasons at Molineux, having secured a transfer to England when he was just 19. He previously appeared in the Champions League at Porto and has now admitted to wanting a return to the competition amid links with Liverpool. WHAT THEY SAID: In an interview with The Times, Neves said: “One of the things I miss most is the Champions League, it’s the best competition in the world to play in. So let’s try to achieve that."" He added: ""If you ask me at the end of last season [about my future] I would have said to you, ‘I will leave’ but I’m still here, so we never know what’s going to happen.” THE BIGGER PICTURE: Neves emerged as a potential target for Liverpool after Jurgen Klopp admitted that they are on the hunt for a new midfielder ahead of the transfer deadline, with injuries having decimated his squad at the start of the season. Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong has also been mooted as an option for the Reds. IN THREE PHOTOS:  WHAT NEXT FOR NEVES?

5017,McTominay responds to Man Utd 'disgrace' claim from Neville as former players bash Red Devils,"Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay has responded to pundit claims that his side were a ""disgrace"" and didn't try hard enough in a 4-1 loss to Manchester City on Sunday. Gary Neville and Roy Keane bashed the Red Devils, and McTominay was asked about their comments after the match. While the 25-year-old admitted the defeat ""hurt"", he feels disappointed that people are questioning United's effort level. ""From my point of view, on the pitch, it's hard to see what's going on around you but if that's what people are saying then so be it,"" McTominay said on Sky Sports. ""They're all entitled to their own opinion but, for myself, it's incredibly disappointing if people think that. ""I'll have to watch it back and see body language and things like that but, for myself, it hurts. If you give a team like that all the time in the world in the second half, you're gonna get punished. It's as simple as that."" ""They were a disgrace in the last 25 minutes,"" Neville said. ""It's the first time Ralf Rangnick has taken them against a proper team and they have been given a proper doing."" Keane, meanwhile, chimed in by saying ""they gave up"". He added: ""They threw the towel in, which is shameful. Who's running that dressing room? These guys seem more bothered about, ‘How am I looking? How’s my hair looking? Are my boots nice?’ You leave your ego at the door when you play for Man United."" Neville and Keane have had goes at Manchester United all season, often slamming their body language and effort. Against Manchester City, however, it may have been a matter of a talent disparity - as Ralf Rangnick has argued. The Red Devils are currently 22 points behind Manchester City in the Premier League table.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mctominay-responds-to-man-utd-disgrace-claim-from-neville-as/blt93d8a6de21773fff,Dan Bernstein,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
790,Kostic to join Juventus in €17m transfer as midfielder leaves Frankfurt ahead of UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid,"Juventus have signed Filip Kostic for around €17 million ($17m/£14m), with the deal confirmed by Eintracht Frankfurt manager Oliver Glasner on Tuesday. Kostic, capable of playing anywhere on the left side, leaves Frankfurt as one of the club's most revered players in recent memory. He delivered an assist in the Europa League final victory over Rangers in May and was involved in 21 goals across all competitions last term. As a result of his contributions, Glasner holds no grudge against the Serbia international for moving to Juventus, with the head coach calling him a ""hero"" in comments made ahead of the UEFA Super Cup with Real Madrid. ""From a sporting point of view, the fact that we are losing such a player is clearly a weakening,"" the manager told reporters. ""But I also [feel OK] because I know how the season started last year with Filip's strike, where he didn't play.  ""We had a lot of talks then and he put himself 100 per cent at the service of the team. That's when I said that he should leave the team as a hero for once. That's what he's doing now, he's leaving Eintracht as a European Cup winner. As a hero who helped shape it. ""He was player of the season in the Europa League, which he deserves. I don't begrudge him that from the bottom of my heart. From a sporting point of view, it's a shame."" Glasner continued: ""We have had the Filip issue every year since he joined us. Of course it's a shame, Filip has done a lot for this club. He leaves as a hero who played a big part in this team - but you have to be honest: That's part of football. ""Players come and go. Today is the day an important player left. That is part of the game. We have a team that is capable of winning games and performing well without Filip. It's a pity, but it's nothing that will throw us off track."" An announcement is expected this week, as Kostic is already set to land in Turin on Tuesday to complete a medical. The 29-year-old could make his Juventus debut on Monday against Sassuolo or on August 22 against Sampdoria.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/kostic-juventus-transfer-frankfurt-uefa-super-cup-real/blta2db7f7ea56ca0a9,Dan Bernstein,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11008,Roll Allardyce: How Effective Are Late-Season Manager Changes?,"With Sam Allardyce given four matches to save Leeds United, we look at how other Premier League teams have fared when replacing their manager amid a relegation battle.  Football managers are more expendable than ever. When Javi Gracia was given the chop by Leeds United last week, he became the 14th Premier League boss to lose his job this season, which is a new record.  But just how important are managers? Of course, getting rid of the bloke in charge is often a Hail Mary by the board when they’ve run out of other ideas or can’t buy additional players to put things right.  Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola thinks the significance of the manager is overstated, saying last September: “It’s not what you have to do, it’s when you have to do it. That’s why football is so difficult…How you have to make the decision, how many times you do it: it only belongs to the players. I’ve said it many times: we, the managers, are overrated in our influence. The game belongs to them [the players].”  When the threat of relegation is looming, replacing the manager is a common response. Sam Allardyce was hired by Leeds last week with four matches to save them from the drop. On the face of it, that doesn’t seem anywhere near long enough to get to grips with the situation and coherently get your ideas across to a team.   Some would argue it’s more a case of getting back to basics and giving players a boot up the backside. Leeds are by no means the first to swap managers ahead of or during the run-in, but how effective are late-season Premier League manager changes?   We looked back over the previous 10 instances of relegation-threatened Premier League teams changing their manager with 10 or fewer games left in a season. This took us back as far as the 2012-13 season, and the list includes full-time and interim appointments, but obvious caretaker roles (Hayden Mullins at Watford in 2019-20, for example) and appointments made after relegation was confirmed have been excluded.  Obviously, the aim of all clubs who make such a change so late in the season is to have the so-called ‘new-manager bounce’; a sudden and emphatic up-turn in form that we’ve come to associate with mid-season manager hirings.  But being hired to specifically steer a struggling team away from relegation adds another layer of pressure and stress to the situation, and it’s one few manage to successfully get out of.  Of the 10 instances identified, only three late-season hires have managed to guide their respective teams to Premier League safety. In the 2012-13 season, Paolo Di Canio had seven games to save Sunderland, and he succeeded. Two years later, at the same club, Dick Advocaat repeated the feat after being hired with nine matches left. Then, in 2017-18, Mark Hughes was brought in for Southampton’s final eight fixtures of the campaign and managed to keep them up.   Over the 10 years in question and prior to Allardyce, the latest managerial change by a team battling relegation was West Brom in 2017-18. Tony Pulis started the season in charge, but he was replaced in November 2017 by Alan Pardew, who in turn only lasted until April. Darren Moore stepped into the void with the Baggies rock-bottom heading into the last six games of the season.   That was ultimately where they finished, five points adrift of safety, but Moore won plenty of credit for how they battled. He oversaw defeats of Manchester United (at Old Trafford) and Tottenham Hotspur, and they held Liverpool to a 2-2 draw at the Hawthorns. His only loss came on the final day of the season at Crystal Palace when their relegation had already been confirmed.  Moore averaged 1.8 points per game, the most of the 10 managers who qualified for the study. Remember the time Michael Jackson tried to save Burnley? Well, his 1.4 points per game was the second most in our list, although still insufficient as the Clarets dropped to the second tier.  The worst points per game record belongs to Eric Black, who Aston Villa appointed as interim manager in March 2016 to see them through to the end of the 2015-16 campaign. He managed just one point from seven matches at the helm, or 0.14 per game, with the Villans eventually finishing a whopping 22 points from safety.  In fact, Black was one of only two of the 10 managers in question who failed to record a points-per-game improvement compared to the rest of the season, with Villa previously averaging 0.5. The other manager was Nigel Adkins, who was in charge of Reading’s last eight games in the 2012-13 campaign – he averaged 0.6 points, with the Royals having been at 0.8 prior to his arrival. They finished second-bottom.  The common denominator for teams who managed to stay up following late-season appointments was that all three were above the relegation zone when the new manager was confirmed. Sunderland were 16th and 17th respectively when Di Canio and Advocaat were hired, while Southampton were also 17th at the time Hughes arrived.   Leeds will hope that’s a good omen. Allardyce was also brought in with the club sat 17th in the table, above the bottom three on goal difference.  Di Canio’s Sunderland ended up three points clear of Wigan Athletic in 18th, owing much to back-to-back wins in mid-April. In his second game at the helm, the Black Cats beat bitter rivals Newcastle United – who were also in a bit of trouble – 3-0 at St James’ Park, and they followed that up with a 1-0 win over Everton at the Stadium of Light.  A 6-1 hammering at Aston Villa dented morale, but another couple of home draws – against Stoke City and Southampton – ensured Sunderland staved off the threat of relegation.  They then did it again a couple of years later. Gus Poyet reached the end of the road in March 2015 after beginning the year with one league win in 10 league games, leading to Advocaat’s appointment.   Much like Di Canio, Advocaat presided over a defeat of Newcastle in just his second match, a 1-0 victory secured by Jermain Defoe’s stunning long-range volley at the Stadium of Light. That was followed by a 4-1 home loss to Crystal Palace, but then came a five-game unbeaten run that meant losing 3-1 to Chelsea on the final day was irrelevant.   ✨ GOAL OF THE DECADE ✨You've voted for @IAmJermainDefoe's volley 🆚 Newcastle as your top goal from the last 🔟 years!👏👏👏 pic.twitter.com/ZVjUdrqLRY A 0-0 draw away to Arsenal on the penultimate matchday secured their Premier League status for another year, with Advocaat moved to tears at the end of that match.  There wasn’t quite the same show of emotion from Hughes when he helped Southampton stay up in 2018, but deep down he must’ve been incredibly relieved – shocked, even – given how poorly his reign started.  Hughes began with three defeats on the trot, conceding three times in each game. West Ham won 3-0, then Saints lost 3-2 to Arsenal and Chelsea, even relinquishing a two-goal lead against the Blues.  But then came a run of four games without defeat, including victories over Bournemouth and Swansea City, the second practically confirming survival ahead of the visit of newly crowned champions Manchester City on the last day of the season.  Allardyce spoke a big game about the like of Guardiola, Jurgen Klopp and Mikel Arteta being no better than him during his first press conference as Leeds boss last week.  They were the bold claims of a man clearly not lacking in self-belief, and don’t expect that confidence to diminish if he does go on to save Leeds.   To be honest, if he manages it, fair play. While they may not be the relegation near-certainties that Southampton are, with Saints given a 0.1% chance of survival, results over the weekend made Leeds’ outlook bleaker.  Obviously, losing 2-1 at Man City wasn’t exactly surprising. Actually, that scoreline probably defied the expectations of even some of the most optimistic supporters.  But with Nottingham Forest beating Southampton to all but put Saints down and Everton astonishingly thrashing Brighton 5-1 at the Amex Stadium, Leeds dropped to 19th. Subsequently, their chances of relegation increased by 17.1% to 75.2%. That makes them second favourites to drop into the Championship.  They’ve also got a tricky final three games. The average Opta Power Ranking of their remaining three opponents (Newcastle United, West Ham and Tottenham Hotspur) is 30, making their run-in the fourth hardest of all 20 Premier League teams.  The caveat in that respect is four of the bottom five are among the teams with the six hardest run-ins according to the average Opta ranking of opponents. Leicester have the most difficult end to the season (average ranking: 22), Forest’s (33) is deemed only slightly easier than Leeds’, and Southampton’s is 35.3. The supercomputer considers Everton (60.7) clear favourites to break clear of the bottom three.  With Leeds, if they do go down, it’s not even that they can really be accused of acting too late with regards to sacking Gracia – he only had a couple of months in charge, so if anything the criticism that’ll likely be aimed at them is that the Spaniard was a strange choice in the first place.   For Allardyce, taking the job on was a no-brainer because it’ll be easy enough for him to claim they were already well on their way to relegation before he was hired. If he keeps them up, he’ll have achieved something few thought he could.  Either way, as Guardiola suggested, the outcome now is effectively down to the players after the Leeds hierarchy’s final roll of the dice.  Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

5372,Kaizer Chiefs had food poisoning against Simba SC - Jwaneng Galaxy’s Ramoreboli responds to Orlando Pirates claims,"Jwaneng Galaxy head coach Morena Ramoreboli has claimed Kaizer Chiefs had to be injected for food poisoning before their Caf Champions League second leg quarter-final in 2021 against Simba SC. The Tanzanian side won by a 3-0 margin in Dar es Salaam, but Ramoreboli has claimed Amakhosi underwent an ordeal ahead of the match.This after Orlando Pirates complained of the treatment they received last weekend when they too had to play Simba away from home, albeit in the Confederation Cup. ""If Kaizer Chiefs can tell you what happened there you will be shocked. Some Chiefs players had to be injected because those guys put something in their pre-match meal that made the players very tired,"" Ramoreboli told KickOff. ""Your pre-match meal will be prepared separately from the rest of the guests in the hotel.  ""Those people [at Simba] will do anything to win a match, even if it means killing someone to win a match. They will do it. I’m scared of what those people do. They don’t care at all. ""With what they do to players, then you will understand that at some point, they will kill someone. Imagine that some of the Chiefs players had to be injected because the food was poisoned. So, you must understand how dangerous they are."" Ramoreboli’s Galaxy came up against Wekundu wa Msimbazi in the Champions League’s preliminary round last year and adds that they were also frustrated. ""They didn’t expect that we would come back as strong as we did, so they were not as hard as they were with others, like Chiefs,"" the South African added. ""At the airport, they will delay you by looking for things that don’t make sense so that you get frustrated. ""They give you a bus, not in good condition and they don’t care. They make it a point that you struggle to find a pitch to train on when you arrive early. It is difficult to get a ground when the host doesn’t even want to talk to you. ""I was fortunate that before I went there, I consulted with coach Pitso [Mosimane] and he told me about how stubborn they are at their home ground. I also spoke to someone at Chiefs. ""On the day of the match, I knew that we can’t eat the pre-match meal at the hotel because they have their chefs there."" Pirates will host Simba on April 24 in the second leg of the Confederation Cup quarter-final duel, and Ramoreboli tips the Soweto giants to overturn the 1-0 loss they suffered in Tanzania. ""Pirates obviously have the quality to get past Simba,"" he concluded. ""In terms of quality, Pirates are far better than Simba.   ""They [Simba] are not as good, which is why they make sure that they use whatever resources they must [to] disturb you when you go there. ""Playing Simba away is always difficult because they do whatever it takes to win the match, whether it is good or bad.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/kaizer-chiefs-food-poisoning-orlando-pirates-simba-sc/bltc2b80bd8fe699013,Kiplagat Sang,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
6523,Man Utd considering all plans to redevelop Old Trafford including potential demolition of current stadium,"Manchester United are open to all ideas to redeveloping their Old Trafford stadium including proposals to completely rebuild their home ground on the same site.  It is understood that plans to bulldoze their current home ground to build a modern new version are ‘premature’ but they are not ruling anything out as they explore all options available.  The club is yet to appoint a developer to work with them but companies competing for the contract have started offering a variety of options and club officials are keeping an open mind at this time.  The club wants to modernise the stadium to improve the matchday experience for fans. The 112-year-old stadium needs more than a lick of paint to bring it up to the standard of some other Premier League grounds.  Over the years discussion has centred around extending the capacity in the South Stand, but there are plenty of options on the table as they look to improve the current ground - including knocking down the current stadium and building a new one from scratch.  At this moment in time that looks like the least likely option as they would like to do the work in a way which would allow the team to carry on playing their home games at the ground, but all options will be considered.  It is understood their intention is to remain on the same site.  Until a master planner is appointed no concrete decision will be made and the club say they are committed to consulting supporters throughout the process. Collette Roche, chief operating officer, gave an update to the Fans’ Forum late last month. She said: “Turning to stadium development, since our last meeting we have been assessing the capabilities of globally-leading consultants who want to help us develop a masterplan for the modernisation of Old Trafford, with the ultimate aim of improving the matchday experience for fans.  ""We have met with companies across a range of disciplines, including architecture, engineering, construction, crowd modelling, transport, security and many more. We are hoping to appoint our preferred partners in the coming weeks; following this, we will be able to formally kick-off Phase 1 of the project, which will be focused on establishing the vision and objectives for the masterplan."" ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-considering-plans-redevelop-old-trafford-including/bltf80b67c1d09130d9,Charlotte Duncker,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

At Chelsea, however, the No.9 seems to carry a curse.

4445,"Guimaraes, Wood and more - Will Newcastle's £90m spending spree secure Premier League survival?","At the end of a frantic and often chaotic first transfer window, Newcastle United’s new owners will be under no illusions about how tough it will be to build a super-club from scratch. Having so much money – ambitions well above their current status as relegation candidates – puts them in an uncomfortable position with clubs and players. It is not easy to get deals over the line; to sign at market value or convince high-profile players that joining Newcastle is a risk worth taking. Ultimately, though, it was a successful window for Eddie Howe. Five new players have arrived for a total of £90 million ($122m) and what is most striking about the deals – after a month of links with the likes of Aaron Ramsey and Anthony Martial – is just how sensible they are. Newcastle have avoided the allure of a Robinho-like statement acquisition and have instead targeted players ready to fight against the drop this season, prioritising (or at least, landing on) Premier League experience and a set of players who will all be desperate to prove themselves on Tyneside. Heading into the window, what Newcastle needed most of all was defensive reinforcements. Steve Bruce’s side were hopelessly disconnected between the lines, their porousness seemingly the result of their manager being caught between a progressive style and his more attacking instincts. The appointment of Howe was interesting because his defensive record at Bournemouth betrayed an inability to organise at the back. Across five seasons in the Premier League his team averaged 66 concessions per year, suggesting Howe badly needed defensive upgrades at Newcastle to paper over the cracks. Dan Burn is a powerful left centre-back who has blossomed under Graham Potter and his £13m ($18m) acquisition represents an instant upgrade. On the other side, Kieran Trippier is extremely reliable and ought to indirectly improve the performances of Jamaal Lascelles. Matt Targett is a solid if unspectacular left-back, but when midfielder Matt Ritchie has been playing there all season, Targett is a welcome addition nonetheless. On the simplest level, better defenders means better defending, but for Howe a leaky defence is a tactical issue. His Bournemouth team were fundamentally too expansive when in possession. The lines of their 4-4-2 were overly stretched and the pressing often appeared sporadic, which meant opponents could slice through them all too easily. Fortunately, Newcastle’s new signings should also help this side of things. Trippier, Burn, and Bruno Guimaraes are very talented on the ball, and their ability to retain possession under pressure should lead to fewer giveaways in the Newcastle half. In other words, Newcastle can begin to gradually hold more possession and move higher up the pitch, avoiding the pitfalls of Howe’s Bournemouth – who moved in the opposite direction as the manager’s transfers failed to improve his team’s passing. Howe’s trajectory at Bournemouth was to move away from possession-obsessive football in his first two years in the Premier League to a deeper line of engagement and a counter-attacking approach. In that respect his appointment at Newcastle - as a midpoint between two styles as they look to build – made sense. And the centre-piece for Howe, as he seeks to shift Newcastle into a more advancing position without it leading to defensive chaos, is Guimaraes, signed for £33m ($44m) from Lyon. That price could prove to be a bargain. Guimaraes is an all-action central midfielder equally adept at breaking up play, recycling possession, and creating chances with his superb eye-of-the-needle passing – as a statistical breakdown of his 2021-22 campaign in France shows. Compared to Premier League players to have featured in more than five games this season, Guimaraes sits second for passes made under pressure (12.3 per match), fourth for progressive passes (7.91 per 90), second for most carries made among non-centre-backs (1199), third among midfielders for long passes completed (186), third among midfielders for goal-creating actions (10), and third in the division for tackles made (60). He is a brilliant footballer, and one whose intelligence in each third of the pitch should allow Newcastle to hold far more possession – and do so with penetration. That, alone, will significantly decrease their chances of being susceptible to getting caught with the shape too wide and the defenders exposed. Of course, Howe is not planning to turn Newcastle into a possession-dominant team and will anticipate his side continuing to spend long periods behind the ball. That is why Chris Wood, a target man, has been taken from relegation rivals Burnley. With Trippier’s dead-ball delivery and Guimaraes' longer passes forward, Wood can offer something completely new to Howe’s team. It is noteworthy that Newcastle rank 17th in the Premier League for crosses attempted and have only scored four headed goals, while Wood tops the Premier League charts for aerials won (5.5 per game), per WhoScored. The marked difference in styles between Guimaraes and Wood are emblematic of Newcastle’s intelligent approach to the January window, mixing relegation expertise with an eye-catching player who could lead them into Europe in the future. Newcastle’s transitional period is very tough to navigate but the balance they have found in their five January signings suggests the owners understand the challenge. We can now anticipate a more confident Newcastle, with possession stats up, a greater sense of calm, and better last-ditch defending from Burn and Trippier when the system falls down. Whether it will be enough to keep Newcastle up is unclear. Guimaraes improves a central midfield that is arguably the weakest in the division, and one man cannot solve the problem entirely, while Howe could have done with a new creative winger to compliment Saint-Maximin. But it was more or less as good a window as Newcastle supporters could have hoped for and – with their squad now notably more talented than those of Burnley, Norwich City, and Watford – there is significantly more hope of survival than there was four weeks ago.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/guimaraes-wood-trippier-newcastle-90m-gamble-premier-league/blt107f97da189f2a06,Alex Keble,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
614,Mane slammed by Owen for his actions in Liverpool's win over Everton in Merseyside Derby,"Former England striker Michael Owen has hit out at Liverpool winger Sadio Mane's conduct in the club's 2-0 win over Everton in the Premier League at Anfield on Sunday. Andy Robertson and Divock Origi scored the goals in the second half to ensure the Reds maintained the one-point gap between them and leaders Manchester City. However, Mane was on the ugly side of the win as he stuck his finger into Mason Holgate's face before raising his arm against Allan.  Owen insists the Senegal international's behaviour was not good and he might have even been sent off. ""This is not good, sticking his finger into Holdgate’s face is something you aren’t allowed to do,"" Owen told Premier League Productions. ""But then he quickly follows it up by raising his arm again and pushing Allan in the face. So, he got a yellow card for one of those two altercations. I think it was the one on Allan. ""You can’t raise your hands and you can’t put it in people’s faces. I think he also has to be thankful that the two Everton players didn’t make a meal of it. ""If any of those players go down and start rolling around, then the referee could then get to VAR… and then you are really risking a red card. He needs to be careful in the future."" Sunday's win for Liverpool was their 12th straight victory at Anfield, and a massive boost ahead of the first leg of their Uefa Champions League semi-final against Spanish outfit Villarreal. The Reds eliminated Benfica in the quarters to seal progression while Villarreal got past Bayern Munich. For Everton, the loss put them in the 18th position with 29 points, two below Burnley but with a game in hand.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mane-slammed-by-owen-for-liverpool-everton-merseyside-derby/bltd59fc5b5df9f6761,Seth Willis,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
10373,AC Milan vs Borussia Dortmund: Prediction and Preview,"We look ahead to Tuesday’s UEFA Champions League Group F clash with our AC Milan vs Borussia Dortmund prediction and preview. Will the visitors book their place in the knockout stage? Borussia Dortmund’s UEFA Champions League campaign was in danger of unravelling when they only earned one point from their opening two games in Group F, losing 2-0 at Paris Saint-Germain before drawing 0-0 with AC Milan in Westphalia. However, BVB enter Tuesday’s return fixture against the Rossoneri on the brink of the knockout rounds after back-to-back wins over Newcastle United. Felix Nmecha’s cultured finish was enough as Dortmund earned a hard-fought victory at St James’ Park on Matchday 3, then Niclas Füllkrug and Julian Brandt were on target as they made it a double with a 2-0 win at Signal Iduna Park in their last European outing. Edin Terzić’s men will guarantee their spot in the last 16 if they win in Italy, having succeeded in keeping things tight in Europe. Indeed, Dortmund haven’t conceded in their last three Champions League matches, and could now keep four successive clean sheets in the competition for the first time since doing so under Jürgen Klopp between April and October 2014. Their three clean sheets in four European outings are as many as they have managed in 12 Bundesliga matches this campaign. While their defensive solidity deserted them on Saturday, Dortmund did end a three-game winless run in the Bundesliga by fighting back from two goals down for a thrilling 4-2 victory over Borussia Mönchengladbach. Terzić will be hoping for a similarly devastating attacking performance on Tuesday. Dortmund have been at their best when hitting teams in transition on the European stage, with only Bayern Munich (17), Real Madrid and Milan (15 each) recording more than their 13 direct attacks in the Champions League this season, while no team has bettered their two goals from such scenarios. In defence, Dortmund will again rely on 34-year-old linchpin Mats Hummels, who has the most combined tackles and interceptions in the Champions League this season (24). He is also one of just three players to reach double figures in the tournament for each of those metrics, along with Milan’s Fikayo Tomori and Galatasaray’s Abdülkerim Bardakcı. Tuesday’s visitors will be without Nmecha for the rest of their group-stage games after the midfielder suffered a hip injury, but they are hoping to have attacking duo Karim Adeyemi and Sébastien Haller available after both missed Saturday’s game through illness. Should Terzić oversee a victory, he will – at the age of 41 years and 29 days – become the youngest manager to beat Milan at San Siro in a Champions League fixture since Pep Guardiola led Barcelona to a 3-2 win in November 2011 (40 years, 309 days). Milan, meanwhile, know their last-16 hopes will be over if they lose and PSG beat Newcastle in Group F’s other game on Tuesday. However, they should approach the match in good spirits after a superb comeback victory over the French champions on Matchday 4, with Rafael Leão and Olivier Giroud on target after Milan Škriniar had given PSG the lead. However, those are the only goals last season’s Champions League semi-finalists have scored in Europe this campaign. Stefano Pioli’s men have underperformed their expected goals (xG) by 3.7 in this edition of the Champions League (two goals from 5.7 xG), with only rivals Inter (-3.8, five goals from 8.8 xG) underperforming their underlying numbers by a greater margin. The Rossoneri were not at their free-flowing best in Serie A on Saturday, but they still secured a 1-0 win at home to Fiorentina as Theo Hernández won and converted a first-half penalty. The left-back has created eight chances in the Champions League this season, a joint-high tally among Milan players (alongside Leão and Rade Krunić). Milan had to field a much-changed lineup for that win, with Pioli’s hands tied by something of an injury crisis. Ismaël Bennacer, Simon Kjær and Pierre Kalulu are among their absentees, while Francesco Camarda, who became the youngest player in Serie A history at the age of 15 years and 260 days on Saturday, is banned due to a recent red card in the UEFA Youth League. Their biggest worry, though, concerns the fitness of Leão, who is doubtful due to a hamstring injury. The electrifying Portugal wideman leads all Milan players for open-play chances created (eight), dribbles completed (15) and progressive carries (34) in the 2023-24 Champions League. These two drew 0-0 in Germany on MD 2, but Tuesday’s game will see Milan host Dortmund in the Champions League for the first time since 2002-03, when the Rossoneri suffered a 1-0 defeat in the second group stage. Prior to that game, Milan had won their two previous home games against BVB, triumphing 4-1 in the European Cup in 1957-58 and winning a UEFA Cup clash 3-1 in 2001-02. That defeat in 2002-03 also represents Milan’s only loss in their last 16 home games against German teams in European competitions, recording 11 wins and four draws during that run. Dortmund have generally struggled in Italy in recent years, losing four of their five matches there in UEFA competitions since winning 2-0 at Udinese in the UEFA Cup in October 2008 (one draw). After masterminding Milan’s MD 4 turnaround against PSG, Pioli is looking to win consecutive Champions League games for just the second time as a manager. He previously did so with a run of three victories last season, when his team followed up group-stage wins over Dinamo Zagreb and Salzburg by beating Tottenham 1-0 in the first leg of their last-16 tie. Dortmund, meanwhile, are looking to post three successive wins in Europe’s premier club competition for the first time since November 2020, when they won three on the spin under Lucien Favre. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off on Tuesday, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. Although Dortmund approach Tuesday’s game two points clear of Milan in Group F, the Opta supercomputer makes the Rossoneri favourites on home soil. Of the 10,000 match simulations conducted by the supercomputer ahead of kick-off, Milan won 48.4%. Dortmund are given a 27.8% chance of a decisive win, with the likelihood of a draw rated at 23.8%. In our overall Group F predictions, Dortmund are handed a 70% chance of advancing, compared to Milan’s 37.5%. The Bundesliga outfit are still seen as big outsiders to go all the way, however, with just a 2.11% chance of lifting the trophy, the 12th highest of any team.

6939,Tuchel opens up on 'bad luck Boehly' and hints at need for big Chelsea transfers after namedropping Haaland,"Thomas Tuchel has opened up on his desire for transfers after seeing Manchester City strengthen by signing Dortmund's Erling Haaland, with Liverpool having already secured Luis Diaz in January.  Those marquee signings for their rivals come amid a time when a sanctioned Chelsea find themselves unable to sign players.  With a private equity-backed, Todd Boehly-led takeover from Roman Abramovich soon to be completed, the Blues will soon be allowed into the market again and Tuchel wants to be active.

""He will get my point of view if he wants to have it.  ""Of course, we lose key players and we struggle lately to win our home games. He was at the final in Wembley.

It is not the moment when I have analysed everything.  ""I don’t have the answer because we would have changed it before. We struggle with efficiency, goal-scoring records, consistency, determination, with precision in the box against teams who defend deep.  ""It is like this, but we lack huge quality like N’Golo [Kante], Ben Chilwell, Reece James, if you see him in the last weeks. ""It is maybe a miracle we are in the top three the whole season without these key players because we missed them for weeks and weeks and weeks and it never stopped for us. Maybe this just needs to change so that we have everybody available.  ""Liverpool bought a fantastic player in the winter to make the existing squad stronger. Man City signed Haaland already to make the existing squad stronger. ""We are losing players so at the moment my focus is to build a strong team and to see what’s even possible and then we think about how we close the gap."" The takeover is still moving forward after a legal resolution to issues between the UK Government and Abramovich over where the money ends up.  It is hoped they will get the deal completed before May 31, which is when their special operating licence expires after being sanctioned.  The Blues have an idea of what they want to do, with their primary target, Sevilla's Jules Kounde, keen to move to Stamford Bridge.  After that they could look at a wing-back or central midfielder, with Brighton's Marc Cucurella, West Ham's Declan Rice and Monaco's Aurelien Tchouameni among their targets. There's also an option to look at signing a striker, depending on player sales, with Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski looking for a move away from the Bundesliga giants. ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tuchel-bad-luck-boehly-chelsea-transfers-haaland/blt99ead17d12f1a7fb,Nizaar Kinsella,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
939,Ex-Liverpool & Ukraine forward Voronin calls Putin a 'son of a b*tch' as he quits role as Dynamo Moscow assistant after Russia invasion,"Andriy Voronin has terminated his contract as assistant manager at Dynamo Moscow amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Former Liverpool striker Voronin has spent the last two years working as a number two on the Dynamo bench, having initially moved into coaching after hanging up his boots back in 2015. The 42-year-old, who also won 75 caps for Ukraine, has now left the club out of support for his country as they continue to try and fight off Russian military forces.

10604,Chelsea vs Aston Villa: Prediction and Preview,"Mauricio Pochettino’s men are back at Stamford Bridge on Sunday but face another tricky test. Look ahead with our Chelsea vs Aston Villa prediction and preview. Another summer splurge and Mauricio Pochettino’s arrival as their new head coach were the remedies to the doom and gloom that enveloped Chelsea for much of last season; lots more talented young players signed to work under a manager with a track record of developing youth. Hope was kindled… It didn’t last very long. Chelsea’s dealings may end up providing long-term success, who knows, but for the most part they continue to bear a striking resemblance to the team that muddled its way to the club’s worst Premier League finish (12th) since ending the 1993-94 season 14th. Sunday’s visit of Aston Villa promises to be another big test. Whereas Chelsea have managed just five Premier League wins in 2023 – the joint fewest among ever-present clubs – Unai Emery’s side have racked up 16, a tally bettered only by Manchester City (22). It’s worth bearing in mind that Villa have been a little erratic during these early weeks of 2023-24, scoring three or more goals in each of their three wins and losing by 3+ goals in both of their two defeats, but they are seventh going into the weekend and Chelsea haven’t beaten top-half opposition (excluding Matchday 1 fixtures) since April 2022 when they saw off West Ham. Clearly, Chelsea’s issues are complex and plentiful, but it’s also possible to see positives. Sure, their -5.3 expected goals (xG) underperformance is the second worst in the Premier League (-5.6 for Everton), but their 10.3 xG is the fifth highest; creating chances hasn’t been a problem, it’s the finishing that’s letting them down, and this could solve itself if the lively Nicolas Jackson manages to gain some confidence in front of goal. Similarly, only City (three), Arsenal and Liverpool (both four) have conceded fewer goals than Chelsea, while their 5.3 xG against is the third lowest in the top flight; so, they’re not giving up lots of clear-cut opportunities either, and territorially they’ve been very dominant as shown by the graphic below and the fact their average share of possession (69.6%) is the biggest in the league. While their opening five fixtures may not have been the toughest on paper, there are some causes for optimism and this is obviously still a squad that’s building cohesion, which isn’t an easy task when you have as many as 12 players absent, as was the case for last weekend’s 0-0 draw with Bournemouth. Pochettino is expecting to have a few of those back this weekend, though. Noni Madueke, Marc Cucurella, Moisés Caicedo, Benoît Badiashile, Armando Broja, Trevoh Chalobah and Reece James could all potentially be back in contention on Sunday in what would be a welcome relief; Chelsea’s substitutes against Luton (20 years, 318 days) and Bournemouth (21 years, 54 days) had the youngest average ages of all benches in the Premier League this season. Villa, on the other hand, could welcome back Bertrand Traoré, Jacob Ramsey and Diego Carlos as they hope to pile on the misery for Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Chelsea do boast a strong recent record against Villa, winning 13 of their past 17 Premier League encounters. A Villa victory certainly wouldn’t be unheard of, though; they were 2-0 victors at Stamford Bridge as recently as April thanks to goals from John McGinn and Ollie Watkins. But it should be highlighted that Chelsea haven’t lost consecutive home games to Villa since a run of three between 1930 and 1933. It’s also been almost 30 years since Villa won back-to-back leagues games against Chelsea. Similarly, April’s away win at Stamford Bridge was Villa’s first in over 11 years, with the last before that coming in December 2011. As already mentioned, Chelsea’s form in 2023 has been pretty wretched, winning just five games in the Premier League. On top of that, their average of 0.86 goals per game over the same period is the lowest of the teams to feature in the top flight both last season and this. Stamford Bridge has so often been a fortress for Chelsea, particularly over the past two decades, yet they head into the weekend having won only two of their past 13 home games in the league, with those coming against Leeds United – who were relegated last term – and a Luton Town side who still haven’t won a point in the Premier League since promotion. They’ve already suffered six home league losses in 2023, their most in a single calendar year since losing seven times on their own patch in 1993. By contrast, Villa have been one of the form sides in the Premier League this year. However, after winning six of their first eight away league games under Emery (D1 L1), they’ve claimed just one victory from their seven most recent games on the road (D2 L4). The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides: Chelsea may have been unconvincing for a while now, particularly when it comes to putting the ball in the net, but the Opta supercomputer is still calculating them to be favourites here. In 45.3% of the pre-match simulations, Chelsea made the most of home advantage to come out on top. Aston Villa’s win probability of 26.2% may look a little low, but combined with the likelihood of a draw (28.5%), the prediction model suggests the visitors are more likely to come away with at least a point than not (54.7%).

8872,'His time is up': Arsenal fans name one player who has no place in Arteta's new system,"Arsenal are back in form after a short Christmas crisis, securing four consecutive Premier League wins.The Gunners have scored 16 goals in those games with Mikel Arteta preferring to play Kai Havertz or Leandro Trossard as a no.9.And some Arsenal supporters are now convinced that Eddie Nketiah has no future at the Emirates that the manager's new attacking system is working so well.Jiggy (reactions via /r/Gunners and Twitter): ""This should be Eddie's last season at Arsenal.""Mein_Bergkamp: ""Eddie dropping out of contention really shows that the whole 'we need a good finisher at 9' line is never going to get their way.

11859,"Tactical Snapshot: Henderson’s Freedom, Consistent Coady & Keeper Creativity","Our data analysts dive into Stats Perform’s advanced metrics to pull out the key tactical snapshots from the latest Premier League action. Data visualizations, AI models and the occasional Arsenal bias can all be guaranteed, as Jonny Whitmore and the team dive into the numbers each week. It is no secret that over the last few weeks Manchester United’s pressing has been uninspiring. A lot of this criticism has been focused on their forwards. Liverpool’s Jordan Henderson took full advantage of this on Sunday. Rarely have I seen a midfielder being given so much space to dictate play. Against United on Sunday, Henderson registered more touches (144) and completed more passes (128) than any other Premier League player has done this season. Sure, Paul Pogba’s 60th-minute red card certainly contributed to this, but the only time Henderson has played more passes in the first half of a game this season was against Watford, where Liverpool had the most passes in a single game this season (816). You can see below the staggering amount of space that Henderson was able to receive the ball in behind United’s lifeless front four. It was a far too common occurrence. Fred and Scott McTominay suffered all game from a numerical disadvantage in midfield and were given an impossible task to cover huge amounts of space. At one stage, Henderson was able to play five short passes in quick succession as he slowly ambled in front of the largely stationary United forwards. It’s sounds like Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s job is safe for now but Manchester United are in dire need of some changes if it is to stay that way. Wolverhampton Wanderers conceded their third goal from a penalty this season against Leeds United on Saturday. That is more than any other team this campaign and a tally equal to or higher than seven Premier League teams suffered over the whole of last season. Despite this, Wolves’ defensive numbers on the season look promising. They’ve conceded just nine goals in the league, a tally bettered only by Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea. The underlying numbers are equally as favourable. Wolves have conceded roughly in line with the expected goals they have conceded (9.8 xG), while only Brentford and Manchester City have conceded lower quality chances overall. A lot of this can be credited to the form and consistency of their back three. Conor Coady, Max Kilman and Romain Saïss have started every game together in the Premier League this season, a feat that cannot be matched by any other defensive partnership. Crystal Palace’s Joachim Anderson and Marc Guéhi are the closest, having only missed one game together due to the former’s absence in their opening game of the season against Chelsea. While the consistency of Wolves’ centre-back partnerships cannot be matched this season, Conor Coady is the true constant in their defence. Since being promoted ahead of the start of the 2018-19 season, Coady has played in 99% of available Premier League minutes for Wolves. Incredibly, he has only missed 119 out of a possible 11,070 minutes available. Leicester City’s Kasper Schmeichel is the only player to have played more over this period (100% of minutes) and Burnley’s James Tarkowski is the closest outfield player (95% of minutes). While the return of Willy Bolly may disrupt their perfect record this season, no one will be displacing Conor Coady in the Wolves backline any time soon. We are continuing to see a trend of goalkeepers becoming more and more involved while their team is in possession. As highlighted by OptaJoe at the weekend, Brighton’s Robert Sánchez set a new record for the highest number of completed (58) and attempted passes (68) for a goalkeeper in a Premier League game. 58/68 – Robert Sánchez attempted 68 passes against Manchester City yesterday, finding a teammate with 58 of them. Since full game-by-game pass data is available for the Premier League (2003-04), both figures are record highs for a goalkeeper in the competition. Rush. pic.twitter.com/DzCujDutUI The trend of goalkeepers increasingly passing their goal kicks within their own box has continued to this season too (unless you’re Nick Pope). 39% of Premier League goal kicks have ended inside their own box this season, compared to 31% last season. This, and the increased dependency on goalkeepers to be better with their feet, has led to a record-high average pass completion rate of 68% for Premier League goalkeepers this season. Over the last ten years, this has gradually increased from 52%. Without the context of pass difficulty here, we can only draw so many conclusions but, for some teams, goalkeepers are now an important part of beating the opposition’s press in order to create goal scoring opportunities. There were three goals this weekend where the goalkeeper was involved in the sequence leading to a goal: For Liverpool’s first goal, they were able to use Alisson as an extra player in possession to evade Bruno Fernandes’ enthusiastic press. This stretched Manchester United’s players, pulling them out of position and ultimately led to their first goal six passes later. There have now been 17 times when a goalkeeper has been involved in the build-up to a Premier League goal this season. If it continues at this rate, goalkeepers will be involved in 72 goals this campaign, just one fewer than the total for last term. There is a reason why goalkeepers with incredible passing ranges like Ederson at Manchester City are seen as so valuable for modern possession-based teams. Ederson has been involved in the build-up to 11 Premier League goals since the start of last season, more than any other goalkeeper.

3453,Isak joins Newcastle in club-record £59m transfer as Magpies swoop for Swedish striker,"WHAT HAPPENED? The 22-year-old Sweden international striker has linked up with the Magpies on a long-term contract. He can expect to become the new focal point of their attack after previously hitting 44 goals through 132 appearances for La Liga employers. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Isak has spent the last three years in Spain, while also earning 37 caps for his country, and has been handed the No.14 shirt at St James’ Park – which was previously worn by the likes of David Ginola, Temur Ketsbaia and Charles N’Zogbia. WHAT THEY SAID: Isak has told the club’s official website: “I'm delighted to have it done. It was a big, big decision for me but it is a decision I am really happy with. “It is a great, historical club that I think anyone would like to play for, with amazing fans. They were a big part of why I came here - and also the club's project, which is one that I really believe in. You always want to go into a team and know how they play. I think Newcastle play very attractive football and I want to be a part of that.” IN THREE PHOTOS:  DID YOU KNOW? Isak has hit nine goals in 37 games for Sweden, and became the youngest goalscorer in his country's history when opening his account in a friendly against Slovakia at 17 years old in 2017. WHAT NEXT FOR ISAK? Eddie Howe could hand Isak his Newcastle debut when they take in a trip to Wolves on Sunday, but if that fixture comes too soon, the forward will likely take his bow against Liverpool on August 31.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/isak-newcastle-club-record-60m-transfer-swedish-striker/blt764d96d7e20aff51,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

2534,Man Utd close in on transfer of Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong as compromise reached,"Manchester United are closing in on an agreement with Barcelona for top transfer target Frenkie de Jong, GOAL understands. There is growing confidence that a deal will be reached for the Netherlands international, with United convinced the Catalan giants want to sell.  A compromise fee of about £69 million ($85m) with add-ons could prove the breakthrough for Erik ten Hag’s first signing of the summer, which would ease mounting pressure on chief executive Richard Arnold.  United are believed to have already seen one bid of £51m ($63m) for the midfielder rejected, with Barca holding out for closer to £86m ($105m).  But GOAL revealed this week that a compromise of between £64-73m could see a deal struck between the two sides.  Further talks have been held since then, with United becoming increasingly optimistic they will get their man.  While an agreement is yet to be officially reached, sources close to negotiations say talks have advanced.  The former Ajax star is seen as pivotal to the system Ten Hag wants to implement at United. He's a player who can pick up the ball in deep positions and carry it forward, which is an essential trait under the head coach.  While Old Trafford leadership insist they will not overpay and will look at alternative targets, it is clear De Jong is the midfielder their new manager wants above all others, having worked with him at Ajax before the 25-year-old’s move to Barca in 2019.  While the player is said to have had reservations about leaving Camp Nou, there is optimism at United that he would welcome a switch to Old Trafford.  A deal for De Jong should pave the way for a host of deals for United, who are aiming to bring in five signings this summer.  They have been holding back on finalising other business until securing their top target in a bid to establish how much of their budget will remain.  An offer has been made to free agent Christian Eriksen, while talks have been held over a move for Antony, the Ajax winger who is keen to reunite with Ten Hag.  Inter’s Denzel Dumfries has been identified as a target at right back, while attentions have turned to Ajax’s Lisandro Martinez after club-mate Jurrien Timber indicated he would reject a move to United. Watford goalkeeper Daniel Bachmann could replace Dean Henderson, who is set to join Nottingham Forest on loan.

4937,How Bissouma inspired Mwepu-less Brighton and Hove Albion against Manchester United,"Yves Bissouma played a significant role as Brighton and Hove Albion walloped Manchester United 4-0 in Saturday’s Premier League fixture. Buoyed by their emphatic 3-0 triumph over Brentford last time out, the Red Devils travelled to the American Express Community Stadium - hoping to consolidate on that result.  Nevertheless, the Seagulls had other ideas as they romped to a convincing win to send Ralf Rangnick’s men home with heads bowed low. Moises Caicedo put the hosts ahead in the 15th minute after benefiting from poor defending by United to beat goalkeeper David de Gea. Four minutes into the second half, Marc Cucurella doubled Brighton's advantage as the Spaniard fired into the roof of the net after he was set up by Leandro Trossard. Things got worse for the Red Devils as they leaked their third goal of the game after Pascal Gross beat De Gea with Cucurella the provider.  Trossard confirmed United’s defeat on the hour mark as he guided the ball home on the line with his chest. Bissouma played from start to finish and statistics showed that he put up a fine display against the 20-time English kings.  Although he could not muster a single shot, he made 52 touches, 35 passes and a passing accuracy of 80 percent. In addition, he completed one dribble and made two top tackles, one interception as well as one clearance. Even though he committed two fouls, he was dispossessed on two occasions.  Unlike Bissouma who saw every minute of action, Ghana prospect Tariq Lamptey was introduced for Solly March in the 76th minute. Meanwhile, Enock Mwepu was not listed for action due to a groin strain suffered against Wolverhampton Wanderers. The 24-year-old has been a first-team regular for the Seagulls this term, scoring three goals and providing six assists in 21 appearances across all competitions. Brighton moved up to ninth place on 47 points with two matches to play in their campaign. They are in action against Leeds United next Sunday at Elland Road.  Rangnick's men can no longer qualify for the Champions League as a result of their loss and are on course for their worst Premier League finish.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/how-bissouma-inspired-mwepu-less-brighton-and-hove-albion/blt19dfb3e5935e49f6,Shina Oludare - @sportingshina,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
7909,Kylian Mbappe 'open to Arsenal transfer' as Thierry Henry influence comes to light,"Kylian Mbappe is open-minded to the possibility of joining Arsenal - because it would enable him to follow in the footsteps of his idol, Thierry Henry.  The France forward, 25, is once again the subject of intense transfer speculation after entering the final year of his contract at Paris Saint-Germain, although it remains to be seen whether or not he will actually leave the Ligue 1 champions. Mbappe was courted relentlessly by Real Madrid back in 2022 before deciding against a move to the Bernabeu at the eleventh hour. Los Blancos are still in the frame for his signature, but it's been claimed in recent weeks that Mbappe is also open to other avenues of interest. While there have been previous links to the Premier League in the form of Liverpool, The Independent claim that Arsenal are an English club that Mbappe would 'willingly join', with the striker enticed by the opportunity of treading the same path as Henry. Henry became the Gunners' all-time leading goalscorer across two separate spells at the club and is widely regarded as one of Arsenal's greatest ever players. The forward turned television pundit is held in similar esteem by his home nation with only Olivier Giroud ahead of him in the French scoring charts. The report does establish that executives at PSG still expect Mbappe to join Real Madrid in the summer, but it's also noted that the financial package on offer from the Spanish giants is significantly lower than what the player himself expected. Liverpool were unwilling to break their wage structure when they were sounded out by Mbappe's camp last year and it's outlined that Arsenal would also take an identical stance on finances should a deal be broached. Although Mbappe is free to negotiate a pre-contract agreement with clubs from overseas, he is yet to communicate whether or not he will take Real Madrid up on their latest offer. It's understood that the contract he has been offered equates to less than he was offered back in 2022 - a deal that the La Liga outfit believed they had wrapped up. Mbappe also turned down a lucrative proposal from Saudi Pro League outfit Al-Hilal back in July after a world-record â¬300 million (Â£255.2m) bid for his services was tabled.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Kylian-Mbappe-open-to-Arsenal-transfer-as-Thierry-Henry-influence-comes-to-light/3301590,,2 days ago,all-football-app
10731,Manchester City vs Newcastle: Prediction and Preview,"Reigning champions Manchester City face a stern test as Eddie Howe’s Newcastle travel to the Etihad Stadium for the first meeting of the 2023-24 Premier League campaign between two of last season’s top four. Manchester City began their quest to become the first English team ever team to win four consecutive top-flight titles with a convincing 3-0 win at newly promoted Burnley on Matchday 1. It was about as predictable a result as they come, with Erling Haaland taking just three minutes and five seconds to find the net; in doing so he scored the earliest goal in a Premier League season for five years (since Paul Pogba’s goal for Manchester United against Leicester City, two minutes and 23 seconds into 2018-29). They now face a much bigger test in the shape of Eddie Howe’s Newcastle, who sit top of the table after their extremely impressive 5-1 win over Aston Villa last week. Alexander Isak was the best player on the opening weekend of the season according to the Opta Player Ratings, scoring two goals and thus becoming the first player to score twice for Newcastle in their first game of a Premier League season since Obafemi Martins against Bolton in 2007-08. Newcastle’s aim will likely be another top-four finish this season, but after the resounding victory over Villa, some fans might be dreaming of even bigger things. The omens are bad for them this weekend, though. They haven’t won their first two games of a Premier League campaign since 1997-98, and their record against Man City – particularly at the Etihad Stadium – is nothing short of atrocious. Man City have lost just one of their last 31 Premier League games against Newcastle, winning 25 and drawing five, with that defeat – a 2-1 loss – coming at St. James’ Park in January 2019. At the Etihad, meanwhile, City have won each of their last 14 Premier League games against Newcastle, scoring 48 goals and conceding just seven. It’s both City’s longest winning home run and Newcastle’s longest losing away run against specific opposition in the clubs’ league histories. However, Newcastle are a much stronger team these days than they would have been for many of the meetings in that run, and confidence will be high after they thrashed Aston Villa on the opening day. It might not be high enough that they believe they have a genuine chance of ending their poor run at City, but they certainly have more of a chance than they did in any other recent meeting, with Newcastle having spent much of their recent history battling relegation while City fought for the title. Haaland now has 38 goals in 36 Premier League appearances, and much of Newcastle’s hopes will rest on how much they can keep the City forward under wraps. They have firepower of their own in Isak and Callum Wilson, though, with Wilson ranking second to Haaland for minutes per goal in the Premier League since the start of last season, having scored every 100 minutes on average to Haaland’s 75 (minimum five goals scored). City will be without a key man in Kevin De Bruyne, which will mean the service to Haaland won’t be quite what it always is. Pep Guardiola confirmed this week that it is a “serious” hamstring injury that may require surgery which would mean “three or four months out.” Newcastle have no fresh injury concerns, with Joe Willock, Emil Krafth and Javier Manquillo still out. Manchester City have scored in each of their last 29 Premier League games against Newcastle, a record for one side against another in the competition. On top of this, City have scored in each of their last 16 halves of Premier League football against Newcastle, which is a joint-record in the competition. City rarely fail to score against anyone and even though Newcastle had the joint-best defensive record in the Premier League last season, they still conceded five goals in their two games against City. Even without De Bruyne, City will believe they can extend their run of never having lost at the Etihad in the Premier League to Newcastle (18 games). City could also reach a major landmark in this game. Having scored 97 Premier League goals against Newcastle, their opponents here could become the first team to concede a century of goals in the competition against City. City have scored at least three times against Newcastle in five of their last seven meetings, and nobody would be surprised if they were to score three more here to make it to 100. The Opta’s Power Rankings are a global team-ranking system that assigns an ability score over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of the game this weekend, here are the Opta Power Rankings for both sides. Both teams come into this game on the back of impressive performances and victories in their first game of the 2023-24 season. City brushed Vincent Kompany’s Burnley aside at Turf Moor on Friday night, before Newcastle battered Aston Villa at St James’ Park. City have won 21 of their last 23 Premier League games at the Etihad, with the exceptions coming in consecutive games against Brentford (1-2) and Everton (1-1) in November/December last year. Newcastle had the third best away record in the Premier League last season, losing only three times in 19 games, though they did end 2022-23 with only one win in their final four away games, losing at Villa and drawing with Chelsea and Leeds. It’s difficult to ever predict anything other than a Manchester City win given their dominance of domestic football over the last few years, and even if Newcastle are one of the better teams in the Premier League, they will have to be at their very best to stand any chance of getting a result here. The Opta supercomputer is giving City, who are huge favourites to win the title, a 69.0% chance of beating Newcastle again here. Newcastle are given just 11.1% chance of pulling off an unlikely upset, with the draw at 19.9%. Everything points to another City win, though they do have to contend without De Bruyne here and that could make a telling difference that gives Newcastle just a glimmer of hope at a ground where they have fared terribly over the years.   Enjoy this? Subscribe to our mailing list to receive exclusive weekly content.

5295,FA Cup replays scrapped for third and fourth rounds to ease fixture congestion amid Covid outbreak,"The FA Cup's third and fourth rounds will once more do without replays, the Football Association confirmed on Monday.  After replays were suspended throughout the 2020-21 season, they returned for this season's edition.  But as the number of games postponed due to the latest Covid-19 outbreak continue to pile up, the FA has moved to ease the fixture backlog for affected clubs.  ""We can today confirm that replays have been removed in both the third and fourth rounds of the 2021-22 Emirates FA Cup,"" the FA signalled in a statement released on Monday. ""This exceptional decision was approved by the FA Board on Friday 17 December and has been taken in the wider interest of English football to alleviate the possibility of fixture congestion following several postponements in recent days and continued uncertainty ahead due to COVID-19. ""Ties in the third and fourth rounds of this season’s competition will be played to a finish on the day, with extra-time and penalty shootouts if required. ""Replays will return up to and including the fourth round of the Emirates FA Cup from the 2022-23 season onwards."" Replays are a traditional feature of the FA Cup, and are notably an opportunity for lower-league clubs to secure a money-making return match should they take a draw against one of the Premier League giants in the early rounds.  In 2020-21, however, given the need to condense the season due to the pandemic, the format was dispensed with in favour of ending each tie in extra time or penalties on the same day.  In July the FA announced that replays would make a return for 2021-22, and several matches in the first and second rounds were decided in that fashion.  Recently, however, a spike in coronavirus cases has caused upheaval in the schedule, with no fewer than six Premier League matches postponed last weekend.  As those games will have to be rescheduled in the coming weeks and months, removing potential replays may help to stop the fixtures piling up for affected teams.

10421,Manchester United vs Luton Town: Prediction and Preview,"Erik ten Hag’s men will aim to bounce back from another Champions League setback on Saturday at Old Trafford. We look ahead with our data-powered Manchester United vs Luton Town preview and prediction. Manchester United will look to make it back-to-back Premier League victories when they host relegation-threatened Luton Town at Old Trafford on Saturday. Having suffered consecutive 3-0 defeats to Manchester City and Newcastle United in the league and EFL Cup, United responded with a much-needed Premier League victory at Craven Cottage against Fulham last weekend, with Bruno Fernandes scoring in injury time to secure a 1-0 win. All three of Fernandes’ goals this term in the Premier League have been the winning goal, with no player netting more such goals this season, and the important victory eased some of the mounting pressure on manager Erik ten Hag, moving United up to eighth in the league table, six points off the UEFA Champions League places. Speaking of the Champions League, though, United suffered another setback on Wednesday with a 4-3 defeat at FC Copenhagen to leave their hopes of qualifying for the knockout stage up in the air. Saturday’s game with Luton will be Ten Hag’s 50th Premier League match in charge of the Red Devils, becoming the 17th manager to reach that many top-flight games with United. A victory will see him become the only one to win as many as 30 of his first 50 with the club. Saturday’s opponents Luton head into Matchday 12 only out of the bottom three on goal difference having won just one of their 11 league outings, though that sole victory did come away from home, beating Everton 2-1 in September thanks to goals from Tom Lockyer and Carlton Morris. And United have shown recent fragility at Old Trafford, losing their last two games on home soil in all competitions; another defeat this weekend would mark the first time they have been defeated in three straight home games since October 1962. They will have to watch out for Luton’s strong finishes to matches, with only Arsenal and Liverpool (eight each) scoring more goals in the final 15 minutes of Premier League games than Rob Edwards’ men (seven), with their goals during this timeframe accounting for 70% of their total goals so far. Ten-man United were beaten 4-3 at Copenhagen on Wednesday after Marcus Rashford was sent off in the first half in another huge blow to their Champions League hopes. They also suffered the added problem of Jonny Evans limping off, and Raphaël Varane, who came on to deputies, could get the nod on Saturday if Evans is unable to recover in time. Long-term absentees Casemiro and Lisandro Martínez aren’t expected back until after Christmas, according to Ten Hag. While Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia are reportedly nearing a return to action, the fixture with Luton is too soon for them to play. Jadon Sancho remains suspended after a fallout with Ten Hag, and there is a real possibility he has already played his last game in a United shirt.  For Luton, this game comes too soon for Albert Sambi Lokonga and Luke Berry while Reece Burke, Dan Potts and Mads Andersen are not expected back until later this year or early 2024. However, Edwards could be boosted by the return of Amari’i Bell to the lineup, absent for the last four games with a hamstring injury. This is the first league meeting between Man Utd and Luton since April 1992 (a 1-1 draw at Kenilworth Road), and the first at Old Trafford since a 5-0 United win in September 1991. Luton are winless in 11 meetings with United in all competitions (D2 L9) since a 2-1 home win in March 1987. This is their first game against them since a 3-0 home loss in the EFL Cup in September 2020. Since losing their first ever home league game against Luton in 1897, United have now won their last 18 against the Hatters, a run stretching back to 1899; in English Football League history, only Everton against Fulham (22, 1961-2018) and Coventry against Norwich (19, 1937-1979) have had longer winning home runs against a side. United’s late defeat at Copenhagen was their third in four outings in all competitions and leaves their chances of reaching the Champions League’s knockout stages in serious doubt, bottom of Group A after four games. It was also the third time in four matches that they have shipped at least three goals. While Luton are winless in five, they have picked up a point in two of their last three outings, including a 2-2 draw away at the City Ground, where Nottingham Forest are so strong, before they also took a point off Liverpool last weekend. United have lost five home games this season, their most after 10 matches in all competitions since 1930-31 (also five). They’ve never lost as many as six of their first 11 at home in a single season before. The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off this weekend, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta supercomputer has Manchester United as big favourites to come out on top at Old Trafford on Saturday, victorious in 61.8% of the 10,000 match simulations conducted ahead of the weekend’s action. Luton have taken points in two of their last three away league outings, but they are given just a 14.9% chance of coming away from Old Trafford with all three points. A draw would be a great result for Edwards’ men, though, and the teams share the spoils in 23.3% of simulations. United were predicted to finish fourth in Opta’s pre-season predictions, but a below-par start means their most likely finish is now estimated to be eighth, finishing in the top four in just 5.2% of simulations. Luton are predicted to finish the highest of the three promoted sides, though Opta still feels they will go down, relegated in 66.8% of simulations. Enjoy this?

4036,'Perfect' - Klopp relieved as Liverpool issue ferocious response to Man Utd defeat,"WHAT HAPPENED? After not winning any of their opening three games of the season, Liverpool had a point to prove, and wow did they prove it. The Reds ran out 9-0 winners against Bournemouth, with six different players getting on the score sheet, including first goals for Harvey Elliott and Fabio Carvalho. WHAT DID KLOPP SAY? Klopp told BBC: ""For us it is early in the season, and if you said to us before the game we could start the season now results wise as well, that means it is not now about controlling the game, it is about putting the opponents under pressure.  ""Wonderful goals. [Liverpool] started immediately again half-time with the 6-0 after half-time. We could bring on the kids, they deserve it so much. Fabio is a special player and a wonderful goal. Everything was perfect, pretty much."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Liverpool have registered their first win of the season, after picking up two points in their previous three games. A humiliating defeat at the hands of Manchester United capped of an underwhelming opening to the season but that has been quickly forgotten with this record-breaking result.  IN THREE PHOTOS: WHAT NEXT FOR LIVERPOOL? Klopp takes his side on the road for their next two fixtures as they travel to Newcastle on August 31 before a crunch match with city rivals Everton on September 3.

9527,Sir Jim Ratcliffe to have bigger role at Man United than just football operations — explained,"Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS are set to have a say in commercial aspects of Manchester United as well, unlikely previously reported. Once their 25% minority takeover was announced, several reports stated they would only control football operations while the Glazers oversee commercial ventures. However, a new report from The Athletic has reported otherwise. In a sensational turn of events, interim Chief Executive Officer Patrick Stewart held a meeting where he explained how Ratcliffe intends to go forward. He confirmed that Ratcliffe's power extends beyond football operations and will have a say in commercial affairs as well. This signals a serious diminishing of the Glazers' power at Man United. The Athletic understands they agreed to let Ratcliffe have greater control as both parties realised it could damage the club further. If two different heads control two departments, there could be a disparity. Man United must function as one, with unilateral decisions across all areas. Stewart, who will be in charge till Omar Berrada takes over in the summer, also re-affirmed INEOS' commitment to cultivate a 'football-first' culture. Glazers agree ridiculous clause to ensure Man United co-owner Sir Jim can't criticize them",https://tribuna.com/en/news/manutd-2024-01-24-sir-jim-ratcliffe-to-have-bigger-role-at-man-united-than-just-football-operations-explain/,Meghna @ 1819,2024-01-24T18:19:01.000Z,The Athletic
11192,Liverpool vs Chelsea: Prediction and Preview,"We preview the Premier League clash between Liverpool and Chelsea, including our pre-match prediction ahead of the early Saturday kick-off between Jürgen Klopp and Graham Potter’s side at Anfield. It apparently takes 21 months to travel to and from Mars. And if you had left on such a space odyssey and returned to Earth in time for this Saturday’s Premier League action, you might have thought you would be watching a battle for the title between Liverpool and Chelsea at Anfield.  Instead, what you’d be greeted by is ninth vs. 10th in the table. And a battle of the embattled.   It’s not exactly the showpiece game you would imagine that Jürgen Klopp would be hoping for in his 1000th match as a manager. But that doesn’t mean the 60th head-to-head meeting between these two sides in the Premier League isn’t going to be one of full of intrigue.  It has been a miserable start to 2023 in the Premier League for Liverpool, even if they did enjoy FA Cup success against Wolves earlier in the week. The Reds have lost both of their league games against Brentford and Brighton, conceding three times in both matches. They haven’t lost their first three league matches in a calendar year since 1953, which was also the last time that they shipped three or more goals in a row in the top-flight.  These defensive worries will be concerning Klopp, despite having a side packed with the talent of Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold, as they come up against Chelsea whom he has won just six of his 19 meetings against, his lowest win rate (32%) against any English side he’s faced 10 or more times.  The German has been a model of consistency at the Liverpool helm – Graham Potter will become the seven different Chelsea manager he has faced in England – and he’s only failed to register victories against Guus Hiddink (one draw) and Thomas Tuchel (four draws and a defeat). It will be the sixth time he’s faced off against Potter in an EPL dugout though, recording three wins, two draws and one defeat during Potter’s spell at Brighton and Hove Albion.  Victory against Crystal Palace may have kept the metaphoric ‘dark clouds’ away from Stamford Bridge for a little while longer, but with just two wins in their last 10 leagues games– none of which have come on the road – Potter will need his magic to start working in his 20th game in all competitions in charge of the Blues. Stumble here and his time at the club could end abruptly.  We are going to conveniently ignore the pair of cup finals the two sides played out last season (both of which went to penalties and ended up with Reds’ success) and instead focus on the last time they met in the Premier League, over a year ago.  All four of the goals came in the first half, with Mohamed Salah becoming the club’s outright Premier League top scorer in London with his 14th in the capital to put the Reds 2-0 in front. But for the second time in the 2021-2022 season, Liverpool would fail to win the game despite being in such an advantageous position. The other occasion came against the Graham Potter led Brighton and Hove Albion.  Just 245 seconds separated Mateo Kovačić and Christian Pulisic’s response for the Blues in what would end up being the second of four consecutive draws the sides played out in competitive fixtures, although this fixture has never been drawn in three consecutive league meetings.  The game was also notable for Sadio Mané receiving the earliest booking (15 seconds) in a Premier League game since 2006-2007, although it is quite some way off Vinnie Jones’ efforts for Sheffield United against Manchester City back in 1990.  Despite those back-to-back defeats to start the calendar year, Liverpool can take solace in the fact this Saturday’s game takes place on home soil. They’ve only lost one of their last 32 Premier League matches at Anfield, finding the back of the net in each of them, scoring 79 goals at an average of 2.5 per game.   However, the home team has won just three of the last 17 Premier League games between the two sides (seven draws and seven losses), though two of those did come at Anfield in 2019 and 2020.  And with six defeats already in the Premier League this season (also losing to Leeds United, Nottingham Forest, Arsenal, Man United) , they are fast approaching Klopp’s previous highs of nine (2020-2021) and eight defeats (2015-2016) across a campaign.  We’ve already briefly touched on Chelsea’s away day blues, but it really is quite drastic. They are looking to win consecutively in the Premier League for the first time since October where, granted, they strung together a run of four victories on the bounce against West Ham, Crystal Palace, Wolves and Aston Villa, having suffered defeat against Southampton Maybe the change of kick-off time will be of benefit to them, as this Saturday marks the first time they’ll be playing in the 12:30 timeslot, although they have lost four of their six such games, including defeats in each of those matches they played on the road.  With Darwin Núñez the latest to join the Liverpool injury list alongside Roberto Firmino, Diogo Jota and Luis Diaz, even more pressure will now be heaped on the shoulders of Salah if the Reds are to get anything from this game.  The Egyptian has been heavily involved in any attacking sequence Liverpool have put together so far this season – leading the way in both shots (58) and chances created (33) for the Reds. But as Brighton proved last time out, it has been possible to stifle his attacking threat, reducing him to just 38 touches during the game, of which only four came in the Seagulls box.  His seven goals in the Premier League this season and four assists might not be quite setting off alarm bells in the owner’s box yet, despite Liverpool handing him a contract extension over the summer and Salah returning from a ‘proper’ break during the World Cup.. But the 30-year-old is underperforming his xG so far this season, perhaps highlighting a dip in his finishing form or rather a reflection on his need to create more opportunities for the side following the departure of Mané during the off-season.    That being said, excluding own goals, 10 of Liverpool’s last 11 goals at Anfield in all competitions were scored by either him or Núñez, after the pair scored just one of the Reds’ first 16 home goals.  It may be taking a little while for the Salah flame to spark, but having scored in his last two league games against Chelsea (as many goals as he had managed in his previous eight games against his former side), a return to the goalscoring form he’s capable of will come as a welcome relief to Klopp and co.   The match-winner last time out for Chelsea, has Graham Potter finally found the role he wants Kai Havertz to play? Or will the German find himself one of the rare sales for the Blues this transfer window? Another strong performance against Liverpool might be enough to keep him around Stamford Bridge a little longer, even if Bayern Munich appear keen to step up their interest.  The German leads the way when it comes to goals (five), shots (35), shots on target (17) and shots off target (14) for Chelsea this season. It’s probably not surprising when you consider he has played the third most minutes of any of their players this season (1336), behind Thiago Silva (1523) and Mason Mount (1336). He’s been used in a variety of position across the forwards set so far this campaign, but with the arrivals of Mykhailo Mudryk and João Félix (although he is suspended for this game), we are expecting to see Havertz, if he stays, being used more in a central position.  Havertz does lead the way across the season when it comes to touches in the opposition box for Chelsea (95), but the nine touches he enjoyed against Crystal Palace last time out were the most he’s had in a Premier League game since October (Brighton & Hove Albion, 10). Building upon that and continuing to convert the chances that is created by the abundance of talent alongside him, will help their rise up the table.  He’s also already proved that he enjoys a game at Anfield, having scored in this exact fixture last season. The last Chelsea player to score in consecutive away league games against Liverpool was Joe Cole way back in 2005. How Potter would dearly love that record to be matched if the Blues can take the victory this time out.  Our predictor is in no doubt that Liverpool will put a stop to their two-match losing run in the Premier League with victory over Chelsea. The supercomputer gives the Reds a 51.8% of winning at Anfield on Saturday and also gives the draw more chance of coming true (26.4%) than Graham Potter’s side picking up the three points (21.8%).  Perhaps we shouldn’t be too surprised by this. Liverpool have lost just two of their last 15 Premier League matches against Chelsea, with the Blues having only lost more Premier League games against Arsenal (24) than they have against the Reds (23), with 15 of those defeats coming at Anfield.  A Liverpool victory will give their hopes of UEFA Champions League qualification a huge boost, with our supercomputer Premier League season predictions still giving them a 37.8% chance of finishing in the top four (let’s try to ignore that 0.1% at the top shall we), although it does believe a fifth-place finish is the most likely outcome for the side, behind Manchester United and Newcastle United, but ahead of Tottenham Hotspur. Victory for Chelsea though will have huge ramifications on their current expected eighth place finish, just ahead of Fulham, and maybe keeping their own Champions League dream alive.  Enjoy this? Subscribe to our newsletter to receive five stories each Friday.

6764,"Africa at the World Cup: Which teams have qualified the most times, who's never qualified?","Ten African countries will be battling for their reserved five places in the 2022 Fifa World Cup to be played in Qatar from November 21 to December 18. On Friday, March 25, the Democratic Republic of Congo will host Morocco as Cameroon entertain the former Africa Cup of Nations champions Algeria. Tunisia will be away to Mali as the newly crowned Afcon Champions Senegal make a trip to Egypt. Another mouth-watering clash will be between Nigeria who will be away in Ghana. The second leg of these matches will be played on March 29 and the aggregate winners will qualify. While other teams are aiming at making another appearance in the prestigious competition, there are those that have never made it to the global stage despite numerous attempts. A total of 41 countries in Africa have never qualified for the World Cup and Zambia tops the list. The Chipolopolo have made most attempts, 14, but to date they are unsuccessful. Guinea and Kenya come in the second position having tried 13 times since the event was started in 1930. Ethiopia and Sudan have played 12 qualifiers in vain. East Africa heavyweights Uganda, Burkina Faso, Malawi, Sierra Leone, and Zimbabwe have tried 11 times to make it to the competition without success. Congo, Liberia, Madagascar, Tanzania, Benin, Gabon, Gambia, Libya, Mozambique, Lesotho, Mauritius, Namibia, Niger, Eswatini, Guinea-Bissau, Botswana, Mauritania, Rwanda, Somalia, Burundi, Cape Verde, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Seychelles, Djibouti, Eritrea, Mali, Sao Tome & Principe, Comoros, Central African Republic and South Sudan are other African countries still striving to qualify. Cameroon are the team that have played most times in the competition, seven. Their best outing was in 1990 when they reached the quarter-finals but were eliminated by England. Then Nigeria are in the second position. The Super Eagles have played in six World Cups; they have advanced to the second round on three occasions -1994, 1998, 2014. North Africa nations Morocco and Tunisia have represented Africa five times each. The best outing is for the former who reached the second round in 1986. Algeria have made it to the tournament four times, the most recent coming in 2014 where they reached the knockout phase. Ivory Coast, Egypt, South Africa and Ghana have been on the global scene three times. It is the Black Stars who have managed to advance the furthest, the quarter-final in 2010.

7170,Newcastle's £33.5m transfer bid for Arsenal-linked Bruno Guimaraes accepted by Lyon,"Newcastle have seen a £33.5 million ($45m) bid for Arsenal-linked midfielder Bruno Guimaraes accepted by Lyon, GOAL can confirm. The Magpies are pushing ahead with a significant recruitment drive under their new Saudi-backed owners, with over £30m ($41m) already spent to sign Kieran Trippier from Atletico Madrid and Chris Wood from Burnley. More incomings are expected at St James' Park before the winter window closes as Eddie Howe seeks to build a team capable of avoiding relegation, and Guimaraes is next on the club's list of targets. Newcastle have launched an opening offer for Guimaraes, who has also been strongly linked with Arsenal over the past few weeks. GOAL understands that Lyon have accepted the bid and the Brazilian has agreed to move to Tyneside on a four-year-deal. OL publicly maintain that no such agreement been reached, but GOAL can confirm they are actively looking for a replacement. Guimaraes initially headed to the Ligue 1 side from Athletico Paranaense in January 2020, and still has two-and-a-half years left to run on his current contract. Guimaraes added fuel to the rumours of a potential move away from Lyon on January 24 as he suggested his talent is being stifled in Ligue 1. ""In France, there are moments where we play like robots, nobody tries to dribble, to find a pass, for example,"" he told Globo Esporte.  ""That irritates me sometimes, it is a bit frustrating. I think that those who have talent should profit from that, try to dribble, try to link moves. If you do that, your game will be complete."" He added: ""My objective at Lyon is to be champion… We are doing well in the Europa League, a competition that we have begun well in. Ligue 1 is very difficult."" GOAL can confirm that Newcastle also approached Sevilla over a possible deal for defender Diego Carlos. However, the two clubs are too far apart in their valuation of the player at the moment, with Sevilla reluctant to sell one of their prized assets midway through the season. Newcastle have also been keen on landing Jesse Lingard on loan from Manchester United, although the discussions are on the verge of collapsing. The Red Devils have given permission for Lingard to leave the club on loan this month and while Newcastle have offered to cover all of Lingard’s wages, and pay Ralf Rangnick's side a loan fee, it is understood the sticking point is over an additional fee that would be due if Newcastle avoid relegation.  The 29-year-old wants to leave United this month to guarantee more playing time but unless a compromise can be reached then he will stay at Old Trafford until the end of the season, when his contract expires.  In addition, the Magpies had been interested in signing Atalanta full-back Robin Gosens, but he would prefer to remain in Italy and is in talks to join Inter.

Bielsa's men have conceded 11 goals during that period and now sit just five points above the drop zone, but they do have games in hand on Brentford and Crystal Palace just above them and will be motivated to spring an upset. In stark contrast, the Reds have won their last eight on the bounce in all competitions and haven't tasted defeat since their 1-0 loss away at Leicester on December 28. Liverpool can close the gap to City at the top to just three points if they beat Leeds before they switch their attention to a Carabao Cup final date with Chelsea at Wembley on February 27.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-vs-leeds-tv-channel-live-stream-team-news-and/blt9b5d3866dac4589e,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

6286,‘Ronaldo doesn’t know the Europa League soundtrack!’ - Ferdinand understands Manchester United exit push,"Cristiano Ronaldo’s push for the exits at Manchester United is entirely understandable says Rio Ferdinand, with a born winner not prepared to sit around and wait for the Red Devils to get their act together as he “doesn’t even know what the Europa League soundtrack sounds like”. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner, who made an emotional return to a spiritual home in the summer of 2021, is looking for a way out of Old Trafford as he feels his personal ambition for trophy challenges cannot be matched by the Red Devils’ class of 2022-23. Various landing spots are now being mooted for the 37-year-old forward, from Chelsea to Paris Saint-Germain, and former team-mate Ferdinand can appreciate why an all-time great is eager to sever ties with an underperforming outfit that once again missed out on a top-four finish last season. Ferdinand told his FIVE YouTube channel: “Of course he's not happy! You're talking about Cristiano Ronaldo here! I don't understand how it's a big story that Ronaldo is not happy with the way things are at Man Utd. He can't be. I wouldn't be. “Anyone who wants to win football matches or trophies, anyone who is used to winning and competing every year at the top of the table for the biggest prizes, and then all of a sudden isn't - and doesn't even qualify for the Champions League - you can't sit here and expect them to be happy. “He's not happy with missing out on the Champions League, he doesn't even know what the Europa League soundtrack sounds like! When that comes on, he's going to be thinking ‘what dance am I in here?’” Pick a club for Cristiano Ronaldo 🤔 pic.twitter.com/MwJ9KPxpEI Ferdinand added, with Ronaldo yet to return for pre-season training: “I've been seeing people being a touch disrespectful. The way that people are questioning 'he's not here' and the hysteria surrounding it. A member of his family is not well, so he's not at training. “This is the most consummate, most professional athlete that we've seen on these shores. The most professional athlete we've seen for over 15 years and people are questioning this guy's professionalism and why he's not at the training ground. “Yeah he might want to leave, he might not be happy with certain things at the football club, but in terms of professionalism, this guy is training where he is - we've seen the pictures. ""His family are there, he needs to be where they are and you have to respect that. Simple as. Could it have been communicated better by the club? Probably.” Man Utd have not sanctioned a switch for Ronaldo, but Ferdinand believes a lack of movement on the recruitment front – with only Dutch full-back Tyrell Malacia acquired so far – is partly responsible for a world-class performer wanting out. The ex-England international went on to say: “He [Ronaldo] will be sitting there on his sun lounger, on his yacht, on his jet. Wherever he is in the world and seeing Man City signing [Erling] Haaland. Seeing Liverpool signing [Darwin] Nunez among other players. [Kalvin] Phillips has gone to Man City as well. “He'll be sitting there thinking 'we had work to do to catch these guys anyway before these big signings and now they're jumping even further away from us'. ""Arsenal are making moves, he'll be thinking 'when is my team going to start making moves?'. We all know we need some new faces in that building. He hasn't seen any movement.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-europa-league-soundtrack-ferdinand-man-utd/blt31866854d5c16d0e,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1608,Watch: Fired-up Ibrahimovic accidentally breaks Milan bus windscreen ahead of crucial Serie A clash with Atalanta,"A fired-up Zlatan Ibrahimovic accidentally broke Milan's team bus windscreen ahead of their crucial Serie A clash with Atalanta. Milan picked up a vital three points at San Siro on Sunday as they beat Atalanta 2-0 to move to within just one point of sealing their first Scudetto since 2011. Ibrahimovic was an unused substitute for the clash, but he played his part in getting the squad motivated on their way to the stadium, inadvertently causing damage to the team bus in the process. Hundreds of Milan supporters lined the streets outside San Siro as the team closes in on the Serie A crown, and Ibrahimovic moved next to the driver at the front of the bus to get a better look. The 40-year-old then started banging on the windscreen to gee up the fans even more, but used a bit too much force as a significant crack in the glass started to appear.

7350,Champions League: Chelsea require another Mendy masterclass to stop Real Madrid,"The sight of Edouard Mendy bellowing at his defence was clear and loud for all to see and hear. In an empty Stamford Bridge, the Chelsea goalkeeper reprimanding his backline after they allowed Karim Benzema to shoot uncontested from the edge of the box in last season’s Champions League semi-final second leg could not have gone unnoticed. That 26th-minute stop prevented Real Madrid from opening the lead on the night and going 2-1 up on aggregate. Some 90 seconds later, the Blues were scoring at the other end with Timo Werner. Seven minutes after the Blues edged ahead, their wall between the sticks was at it again, frustrating the Frenchman from close range with 10 minutes of the opening half to play. While the story was different in the reverse fixture at Valdebebas — where the Real talisman netted a brilliant equaliser out of nothing — Mendy was at his best in West London, twice stopping Los Blancos’ biggest threat with tremendously important saves. The timing of those stops was crucial to Chelsea making it to last season’s Champions League final, which they owed largely to the Senegal shot-stopper’s heroics in denying Benzema. They meet again on Wednesday under different circumstances, and while their last encounter in West London promised a final berth for either side, this is only the first leg of a quarter-final clash. What has not changed is just how much Thomas Tuchel’s team need another massive Mendy performance to make the difference for the home side. While the Blues number one’s overall quality is unquestionable, even the very best can put in concerning performances from time to time. Last time out against Brentford, the towering Chelsea goalie had a game to forget. He presented a chance to Ivan Toney in the fifth minute having made a hash of a seemingly simple pass to Antonio Rudiger which set the tone for the Blues’ error-strewn 4-1 defeat by Thomas Frank’s side, the Stamford Bridge outfit’s first loss to the Bees since 1939. Indeed, an uncharacteristically disorganised and error-prone outing from Tuchel’s team somewhat absolves their shot-stopper — who admittedly could have done better for Vitaly Janelt’s second and arguably Christian Eriksen’s strike — but their German tactician will hope Saturday’s loss was a one-off, especially with Real on the horizon. The precedent under Tuchel in Europe suggests this is the case, too. The Blues have kept 10 clean sheets in 15 Champions League games under the ex-Paris Saint-Germain boss, and the Senegal international has been in goal for each one since February 2021. Only two goalkeepers in this year’s competition are outdoing Mendy’s save percentage (83.3 percent), with Thibaut Courtois (86.1%) one of the pair outranking the African champion. It does come with the caveat of the Real Madrid stopper making a staggering 31 saves (36 shots on target) to Mendy’s five (six efforts on target), although one expects the Chelsea goalkeeper to have a far busier night against the La Liga giants who are not flawless but are undoubtedly an improved team from last season. The motivation to exact revenge on the West London side must appeal to Carlo Ancelotti’s team, even if the Blues’ eight-game unbeaten run in European competition against Spanish sides and Real’s five-match winless record in England does not bode well. Mendy will undoubtedly play a significant part if the Premier League side are to continue Los Blancos’ away blues on English soil. The Liverpool frontman may lead the Premier League scoring charts but he has not had things go his way lately, firing blanks in three of his last four league appearances. It has been a different story in Europe, however, with eight Champions League strikes leaving him just two shy of becoming only the second player representing an English side to score double figures in more than one season, matching Ruud van Nistelrooy’s feat in the early 2000s. With six of his eight strikes coming on the road, the Egypt superstar will back himself to outdo Adel Taarabt’s Benfica and put the Reds in the driver’s seat after Tuesday night’s fixture at Estadio da Luz. Sadio Mane may have netted only twice in this year’s competition, but a 20-minute cameo against Watford at the weekend suggests the Senegal superstar could start in Portugal. Manchester City are often free-scoring at the Etihad Stadium under Pep Guardiola, averaging 2.8 Champions League goals on their turf since the Spanish boss took charge, but they face a test in Diego Simeone’s Atletico Madrid. The La Liga side already knocked out city rivals Manchester United last month, owing to a 1-0 defeat of the Red Devils at Old Trafford, which saw Geoffrey Kondogbia and his teammates claim a 2-1 aggregate success. It was Jan Oblak’s 30th clean sheet in 67 games since his Champions League debut, but City will hope he does not keep a 31st against them on Tuesday. The Citizens undeniably have a plethora of attacking options, yet Mahrez has been something of a go-to figure on their big European nights. Four goals and two assists last season placed the ex-Leicester City wide attacker joint-second for goal involvements in 2020/21 and he has already surpassed last term’s tally, scoring six times and setting up one strike this term. Adding to the aforementioned tally takes City a step closer to a semi-final berth. Samuel Chukwueze faces a race against time to be fit for Bayern Munich’s visit to Estadio de la Ceramica, but Unai Emery must make a tough call at right-back. A strong Serge Aurier performance on his first start in the competition in two years saw Villarreal stun Juventus 3-0 at the Allianz Stadium, leaving the Spanish boss with the choice of either leaving the Ivorian in the side or reintroducing Juan Foyth. Villarreal are massive underdogs against FC Hollywood, but they will relish another surprising outcome in their first quarter-final game in Europe’s premier club competition since 2009.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/champions-league-chelsea-require-another-mendy-masterclass/blt8320b83f645fc6b6,Seye Omidiora,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4617,Arsenal put January from hell behind them with huge Wolves win,"Match statistics: Wolves 0-1 Arsenal  It wasn’t the prettiest but this was a huge win for Arsenal and Mikel Arteta. With everything that had gone on throughout January, and with the knives being sharpened after the decision to let Pierre-Emerick leave without bringing in a replacement, it felt like there was little room for error against a Wolves side who went into the game just two points behind them in the Premier League. Manchester United drawing at Burnley and Tottenham losing at home to Southampton added even more significance to the result at Molineux, so it was no wonder to see Arsenal celebrate the way they did after their battling 1-0 success. If they are to go on and secure a top four spot at the end of the season they will have to play far better than they did to claim this much-needed victory, but that will not concern Arteta or his players on the way back down to London. After a winless January, it was all about the result, not the performance. And thanks to Gabriel’s close-range finish on 25 minutes, they got the win they desperately needed to move up to fifth in the Premier League, just one point behind fourth-placed West Ham with two games in hand. All the talk ahead of kick-off had centred around Arsenal’s January transfer business and the club’s decision to seemingly weaken the squad, rather than strengthen it. Arteta admitted he was well aware of the scrutiny that decision would come under should things go wrong over the coming months, so he would have known the importance of starting off with a win after the mid-season break. And you could see what the result meant to him at full-time, although that would have been down to relief more than anything else after watching his side once again reduced to 10 men. Arsenal received three red cards in their five games throughout January, something their manager admitted they cannot afford to do if they want to stay in the race for the Champions League. So the sight of Gabriel Martinelli receiving two yellow cards in the space of a few seconds midway through the second half would have left him seething. Arsenal's disciplinary record under the Spaniard has been appalling and that can’t continue if they are to keep pace with the other sides competing for a top-four spot. But to their credit, they showed real resolve to hold on away from home under real pressure to claim such an important three points. Gabriel and Ben White were exceptional once again at centre-back, while Aaron Ramsdale pulled off a couple of fine stops as the hosts laid siege to the visitors’ goal late on. Things could have been far more comfortable for Arsenal had Alexandre Lacazette taken one of the chances that came his way. With Aubameyang now gone, there are plenty of questions being asked as to whether the Frenchman can score the goal Arteta’s side will need during the run-in. And he will have done little to silence his doubters with a couple of big misses on Thursday night. One came in the first half when he fired straight at Jose Sa after some superb play by Bukayo Saka and another came moments after Martinelli had been sent off. Having been sent clear by Gabriel’s through ball, Lacazette had time to steady himself. But he could only fire wide with just the Wolves keeper to beat. Fortunately, the misses didn’t cost Arsenal on this occasion, but that is the type of profligacy Arsenal can’t afford from their one remaining senior striker. For now, however, that will not concern Arteta. Before Arsenal’s visit to Wolves, the Spaniard said his team had 17 cup finals left this season. One down, 16 to go.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-put-january-from-hell-behind-them-with-huge-wolves/blt699eaa87ffccaff3,Charles Watts,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

11031,"Newcastle, Milan Rise; Chelsea, Bayern Fall in Opta Power Rankings","Using the Opta Power Rankings, we’re able to judge which of Europe’s biggest clubs enjoyed a good month and which had one to forget. Or, in other words, who’s hot and who’s not. Here, we look at the highest risers and fallers across the month of April. The month of April lasts 30 days. Or 42.8% of Javi Gracia’s reign at Leeds United if you’re looking for an alternate measure of time. For some, it was terrible month. Chelsea – for example – who scored as many own goals as they did real goals in the league during April 2023 (one, also the same number of managers they sacked). Others, like Newcastle – who scored 22 league goals in April, four more than anyone else in Europe’s top five leagues – enjoyed themselves a lot more. But whose performances made a real impact to their Opta Power Rankings? It’s time to find out. Here’s how the top 20 looked at the end of April. To be honest, there’s not much movement in our top 10, with Real Madrid (up two spots to fourth overall) the biggest movers inside that top group. Carlo Ancelotti’s side comfortably dispatched Chelsea across two games in the Champions League quarter-finals, and while the Blues are in total free-fall, they’re still a top-40 ranked team. For now, at least. It’s in the chasing pack (11-20) where April really shook things around. Milan and Newcastle both jumped up seven places in our Power Rankings last month to sit comfortably within the top 20. As mentioned, Newcastle ran riot in April, scoring more goals than anyone else across Europe’s top five leagues. They started the month with a 2-0 victory against ninth-ranked Manchester United, before smashing five past West Ham, six past Tottenham and four against Everton. The 22 Premier League goals they scored in April is only five fewer than Everton have scored all season and Champions League football next year looks like it’s on the cards. Over on the continent, Milan set up a mouth-watering derby against rivals Inter in the semi-finals of the Champions League by overcoming fellow Serie A side Napoli in the quarters. The same Napoli who our model currently has as the third-best team in the world. And the same Napoli who Milan also pumped 4-0 away from home at the start of April. There’s nothing the Power Rankings like more than beating an excellent team in European competition, and Milan have surged up the rankings as a result. Similarly, Xabi Alonso’s Bayer Leverkusen are cruising along in Germany and jumped eight spots to 17th globally. Alonso has guided Bayer to the semi-finals of a European competition for the first time since 2001-02, when they were defeated by Real Madrid in the final of the Champions League. They’ll face José Mourinho’s Roma in the last four of the Europa League after besting Belgian side Royale Union Saint-Gilloise. It was a bad month for Juventus who picked up just four points from 15 available in Serie A over April, scoring three goals across five matches in the league. Plus, they were dumped out of the Coppa Italia by Inter.  The race for the top four in Italy – well, second, third and fourth – is well and truly on, so this sticky patch of form has come at a bad time for the Old Lady. Progression against Sporting CP in the Europa League was perhaps the only bright spot for Massimiliano Allegri’s side, who slipped six places down to 18 in the rankings. Stepping outside of the top 20 clubs now, who had a month to remember? The biggest risers inside our top 500 clubs were Swansea City. The Swans rose a whopping 236 places over April thanks a superb run of form. Only Sheffield United (18) won more points in the second tier than Swansea’s 17, and no Championship side scored more goals than their 14 in April.  Swansea’s inconsistent form in the middle of the season proved their big stumbling block in their bid to earn a play-off place, but they are ending the season promisingly. One side who have realised their hopes of promotion are Ipswich Town. The Blues sealed promotion to the Championship in style last weekend with a 6-0 win over Exeter City. With one game still to go in League One, there’s a chance Ipswich could overtake leaders Plymouth Argyle if the latter don’t win their final game. Regardless, Ipswich have guaranteed themselves Championship football for 2023-24 and could hit 100 goals and 100 points with a win over Fleetwood Town on Sunday. If they manage that, they’d become the first third-tier side to plunder a century of goals since MK Dons in 2014-15. Ipswich have already scored 15 more goals this season than anyone else in the English Football League, and they added another 27 in April 2023. Yes, for those keeping track, that’s the same as Everton have scored in their entire Premier League campaign in 2022-23. We journey back to the continent next to look at Dutch side Emmen, who are based in the province of Drenthe. The name Drenthe is said to mean “three lands”, but it was the land of the three points in April, with Emmen picking up vital victories against SC Heerenveen and Cambuur in their bid to survive their first season in the Eredivisie. Our supercomputer gives them a 48.3% of avoiding relegation altogether, while there’s a slightly bigger chance (51.5%) they end up in the relegation play-off. To France next, where four of our top 10 risers reside: Auxerre (+52), Clermont (+47), Angers (+47) and Brest (+41). First, a word about Clermont, who’ve won their last five games in a row and would top the table if the Ligue 1 standings were run for April only. Auxerre would sit seventh in such a table, but the Opta Power Rankings give them credit for a battling draw at home to Lille (#46 in the world), while Brest went unbeaten last month. Angers won just their third game of the entire season against Lille on 8 April. Presumably when you win 33% of your matches in a single month, the Power Rankings are duty bound to give you a healthy bump in the rankings. While the bigger clubs don’t rise or fall in the rankings as dramatically as those lower down, their Opta Power Rating Score (measured out of 100) can. The honour of the biggest rating risers in April belongs to Sevilla. A recent defeat at home to Girona put an end to their seven-game unbeaten run, the peak of which was undoubtedly their 3-0 victory over Manchester United in the second leg of the Europa League quarter-finals. Sevilla’s love affair with that competition continues – since the competition’s rebranding in 2009-10, Sevilla have made the semi-final of the UEFA Europa League on more occasions than any other side (five). On each of the previous four occasions they’ve made the final four they’ve gone on to win the competition, so we might expect to see them back in this section again for May. April’s not been fun for everyone, though. Championship sides Watford (-184) and Norwich City (-174) plummeted down the rankings, while Millwall (-110) also fell over 100 spots. Watford, who were just one point outside a play-off spot as recently as March, stumbled hard in April, winning just one of their seven games in the month as a mid-table finish looms. Norwich have endured a similarly difficult run, and their final game against Blackpool would be a dead rubber if not for the emotional departure of club legend Teemu Pukki. Despite falling in our Power Rankings, Millwall have maintained their position in the play-offs and a win against Blackburn Rovers on the final day will secure their spot. A 2-1 defeat to rock-bottom Wigan was not what the Lions would’ve wanted on MD43, and that was the first time they’d dropped out of the play-off spots for a month and a half. Ajaccio (-107) continue to struggle in Ligue 1. They scored just two goals last month in France, and their barren run of form now extends to eight without a win. Only Sampdoria (20) have scored fewer goals than Ajaccio’s 22 over the course of 2022-23 in Europe’s top five leagues, while their terrible finishing in front of goal – they’ve underperformed their expected goals (xG) by 13.8 – can only be ‘bettered’ by Reims. Together with Troyes (-65) they look doomed. Unsurprisingly, Chelsea (-4.33) fell the most over April in terms of their rating out of 100. A lot has been written about the Blues, lots by us as well, but their April performance needs to be filed away in a folder entitled ‘Absolute Shocker’. Conor Gallagher’s deflected strike against Brighton served as the men’s team’s only contribution to Chelsea’s Goal of the Month competition for April. That solitary strike came from a staggering 7.3 xG generated, and if ever a stat summed up Chelsea’s total profligacy up front, it’s that no other side underperformed in front of goal as badly as that in April across Europe’s top five leagues. For a cold, hard dose of reality, Chelsea are now nestled between Mainz and Wolfsburg in our global rankings. Mainz and Wolfsburg have spent a combined €59.5m on players during 2022-23 season. Chelsea spent more than that on four separate players. Bayern Munich lost top spot in the Power Rankings to Man City over the course of the month and their minor wobble has come at a really bad time. The Bavarians were outclassed by Pep Guardiola’s side across two legs in the Champions League, but domestically they’ve toiled too. A shock cup defeat to Freiburg saw them dumped out of the DFB Pokal, before a damaging home draw to Hoffenheim and an away defeat to Mainz means the Bundesliga title race is a lot tight than it should be.

6831,Bayern Munich reject claims that Ronaldo could replace departing Lewandowski,"Bayern Munich are preparing to part with Robert Lewandowski, after reaching an agreement with Barcelona, but that does not mean that they are about to make a move for Cristiano Ronaldo. The iconic Manchester United forward has been mooted as a possible successor to another global superstar at the Allianz Arena. Five-time Ballon d’Or winner Ronaldo is said to want out of Old Trafford as he seeks to play Champions League football and compete for major honours in 2022-23, but the Bundesliga title holders are eager to point out that the all-time great does not figure on their wish list. Bayern sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic has told Sport1 of the rumours that continue to rage in Bavaria: “I have a lot of respect for Cristiano Ronaldo, his successes and his career. “But again, that wasn’t and isn’t an issue for us.” Pick a club for Cristiano Ronaldo 🤔 pic.twitter.com/MwJ9KPxpEI The German giants are about to find themselves without the prolific Lewandowski, who has spent eight memorable years on their books. He has claimed a domestic crown in each of his campaigns with Bayern, while also helping them to Champions League glory in 2019-20. He has plundered 344 goals for the club through 375 appearances, with Ronaldo and Lionel Messi the only men that can claim to have got close to that kind of output. An opportunity is there for Ronaldo to be acquired, but Bayern are happy with their lot. They have drafted in  Sadio Mane from Liverpool this summer, while Serge Gnabry is close to committing to a new contract. Bayern also have the likes of Leroy Sane, Kingsley Coman and Thomas Muller on their books, which suggests that they will not be short on firepower if another No.9 is not pursued before the next transfer deadline.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bayern-munich-reject-ronaldo-replace-lewandowski/bltf5ed588e3a0d50a4,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

The West African nation disclosed that eight people in their team have been affected by intestinal inflammation which was caused by food poisoning. The Blue Sharks advanced into the knockout stage after finishing their group campaign as the third-best team in Group A with four points after three games – earning a win over Ethiopia and a draw against Cameroon. “Today's training session had all the players on the pitch. However, at the moment, the delegation is facing an outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by food poisoning which affects eight people,” read a tweet from Cape Verde FA.

He also described Tuesday’s encounter as a West African derby as they hope to make the quarter-final stage for the second time in their history. ""We have worked hard in our training and facing a team like Senegal is an added motivation, because the match is like a derby,” Brito said in a press conference, via Caf’s website. “They have to respect us as a team the same way we respect them.

4954,Leeds fan accused of racial abuse against Arsenal bench,"The Premier League will investigate allegations that members of the Arsenal bench were targeted with racial abuse by a Leeds United supporter at Elland Road.  Leeds suffered their second heavy defeat in the space of less than a week as they went down 4-1 to the Gunners, having been thrashed 7-0 by Manchester City on Tuesday.  Following the game Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta spoke out on the alleged incident, emphasising that it was a single fan who was responsible, and Leeds announced an arrest has been made. ""It was reported and the stadium manager will have to deal with that with the authorities"", the manager explained to Sky Sports after the final whistle. ""Very disappointed because we have done so much in football to try to avoid it but it is a single person. I don't think that merits that a full stadium pays the price. ""It was a single incident and it has to be reported. It was reported, and now the authorities will have to work with the clubs to understand what happened."" Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa told Sky Sports: ""It's incredible that you ask me this question, what can I answer you? ""Of course I am against all acts of discrimination."" Leeds wrote in a statement: ""Leeds United can confirm that an investigation into claims of racism during the first half of our game with Arsenal today are underway and that one arrest has been made in connection to the allegation. ""Racism will not be tolerated at Leeds United and any supporter found to be using racist language will be subject to a lifetime ban for all Leeds United games."" Saturday's triumph, the only Premier League game played due to cancellations elsewhere, extended Arsenal's winning streak to three matches.  In that period the Gunners have hit nine goals and conceded just once, and they now occupy fourth place and a Champions League qualification spot.  Leeds, meanwhile, remain just above the relegation zone, five points clear of Burnley in 18th having played three more games than the Clarets. But the on-field action has been somewhat overshadowed by the alleged incident off the pitch.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/leeds-fan-accused-of-racial-abuse-against-arsenal-bench/blta0388040176cde93,GOAL,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11476,Analysing the Eden Hazard Goal that Broke a Real Madrid Record,"It took them 56 minutes to finally unlock the Celtic defence in their opening UEFA Champions League game last night, but Real Madrid eventually showed their class, overcoming their Scottish opponents 3-0. The third goal in the victory showed the class that Carlo Ancelotti’s side possess, with Eden Hazard putting the finishing touch to a 33-pass move to score his first UCL goal since November 2020. That 33-pass move is the longest leading to a Real Madrid goal in the Champions League on record, a longer sequence than all 434 of Real’s goals in the competition since the start of 2003-04 (as far back as data is available). The move lasted one minute and 37 seconds, with no Celtic player having a touch of the ball and started when Toni Kroos played a free-kick into the feet of Luka Modrić. Amazingly, no Celtic player had a single touch of the ball between 73:01 and Kyogo Furuhashi’s kick-off to restart the match on 77:16 – a full four minutes and 15 seconds of dominance, interrupted only by a foul committed by Jota on Eduardo Camavinga, with a 38-second break in play while Real organised themselves to take the free-kick. In fact, the only touch a Celtic player had of the ball between 71:47 and 77:16 was by Josip Juranović to dispossess Vinícius Júnior and concede a throw-in. One touch in five minutes and 29 seconds. Just two goals scored in the UCL since 2003-04 have seen a longer sequences of uninterrupted passes in the build up than Hazard’s strike last night. The longest on record was also scored against Celtic, by Real’s rivals Barcelona. Cristian Tello’s goal in December 2013 at Camp Nou put the cap on a sensational 6-1 victory for the La Liga side. His strike put the finishing touch on a 40-pass move by Gerardo Martino’s side, just nine minutes after entering the game as a substitute. The only other Champions League goal on record to consist of a longer build-up of passes was Dejan Stankovic’s strike for Internazionale in their 4-3 win over Tottenham Hotspur in October 2010 at the San Siro. The goal, capping a brilliant 35-pass move, put Inter 3-0 up inside 14 minutes, which became 4-0 before half-time when Samuel Eto’o added a fourth in the 35th minute. Unfortunately for Stankovic, the game isn’t remembered for his strike, but for Gareth Bale’s sensational second half hat-trick – the occasion where he really burst onto the world scene. Real Madrid’s previous longest sequence of passes leading to a Champions League goal came less than a year ago, in November 2021. Karim Benzema’s strike – one of 15 he scored on the way to finishing top scorer in 2021-22 – finished off a 31-pass move in their 2-1 home win over Shakhtar Donetsk in the group stage.

2517,Vicki Becho: The ‘rare’ France & Lyon teen inspired by Cristiano Ronaldo,"When Vicki Becho, one of France’s most exciting young talents, first started to play football, it was a secret. In the eyes of her mother, it wasn’t a sport for girls, so every time she went play for her club, her neighbour and her aunt would cover for her. That was until the day her aunt took her mother to a match. She thought she was going to watch her son, who played in the same team. She was in for quite a surprise when she saw her daughter on the pitch instead – but it was a surprise she took well. “That’s when she changed her mind,” Becho tells GOAL. “She let me play football.” It’s no wonder she was so easily swayed. Becho has incredible natural ability, further influenced by YouTube videos of Cristiano Ronaldo that she would watch before every match she played. Her other idol was Lucho Gonzalez, the Argentine midfielder who spent three years in France with Marseille. “The first boots that my coach offered me had been signed by him,” she explains. “They were my lucky boots.” Her progress as a young girl was certainly not down to luck, though. At the age of 15 and part of the Paris Saint-Germain academy, she was already playing with France's Under-20s. A year later, she won the Women's U19 European Championship, scoring twice in the 3-1 semi-final win over Spain. This summer, the 18-year-old is in Costa Rica with her country, to compete at the U20 Women’s World Cup, where France will play Japan in the quarter-finals. Her club has changed this time as, in 2020, Becho made a high-profile switch to Lyon, the eight-time champions of Europe. It’s a move that certainly doesn’t guarantee playing time for the young prospect, but incredible exposure to the world’s best. “When I arrived at PSG, I immediately saw the difference with my old clubs. It was already much more professional,” Becho says. “At PSG, everything was harder. ""I had just left the city where I had grown up to join this club. I had a hard time finding my bearings in the beginning, we knew that the spots to go up with the professionals were very limited, so we knew that the only way to climb the ladder was to make people talk about us thanks to our performances and our potential. “I chose to leave PSG to join Lyon because I know myself, I like to rest on my laurels, and by signing at PSG I knew that I would have playing time. But in Lyon with a much bigger squad, it would be more complicated to impose myself. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: “I have chosen a challenge that will shape me in the future. I experience things that I probably would never have experienced in Paris, but I prefer to live them today when I am young to be ready to face any situation later. “Everything is different in Lyon, because in Paris I was the young prospect of the training centre and in Lyon I am just a footballer who fights to make a place for herself. PSG has given me a lot and that's why this club will always have a special place in my heart.” In her first year with Lyon, the skilful attacker was a regular in the club's matchday squads, making three appearances off the bench in the league and another in the Champions League – her competition debut. But last season was her most important yet, as it saw her join Reims on loan for regular minutes. When the opportunity to bring in a player with so much quality arose, head coach Amandine Miquel wasn’t going to let it go by. “In France, she got quite famous when she was 15, as she was with the U20s already,” Miquel tells GOAL. “There are few profiles like this in the world where you have such a mature football player, that are 15 or 16 and are already very good. We knew that she would really help us. “She's a very attentive player. She is very hard on herself. She wants to score all the time. She really has that striker mentality, getting goals, being efficient on her offensive choices. ""She has very good technique - very big quality in both feet. She's got good power. Few women's players have that power in their shot, but also the precision. She's one of those rare players.” Having been at PSG and Lyon, Becho hasn’t had lots of playing time in the top-flight, and Miquel believes you could “clearly” see development from even just one season with Reims. “The rhythm she showed in training, she was starting to recover her speed, her offensive speed to get past opponents, and she was accurate on her shots,” she explains. “She definitely has a big margin of improvement, so she will be a very good player. I think she's starting slowly to understand that being a player of Lyon is nothing if you don't play. She needs to really show them that she has the ability to make the level, to make the group at some point - and she's only 18, so I trust that she will do it at the right time.” That is Becho’s next big aim after the World Cup. She chose the loan so she could bring “more maturity” back to Lyon and it’s clear that she has with the way she speaks about her development. She believes her defensive game improved at Reims, but would like to improve her work-rate – something not many would be so honest about. “First of all, [I want] to win the U20 World Cup and then get into a regular rotation at Lyon when I return,” she says. It’s a tough ask for any player to break into the best team in Europe – one that just won the Champions League again. But Becho recognises the challenge and she’s willing to work for it. After all, she certainly has the ability to get there.

465,Mbappe trains in full after being named in PSG squad for Champions League clash with Real Madrid,"Kylian Mbappe has been included in Paris Saint-Germain's squad for their Champions League clash with Real Madrid after an injury scare, and came through training unscathed on the eve of the game. The 23-year-old fired PSG to a late 1-0 win in the first leg of the round of 16 tie at Parc des Princes to give the Ligue 1 leaders a narrow advantage to take to Santiago Bernabeu. Mauricio Pochettino's side were left concerned that they would have to finish the job without Mbappe after he picked up a knock in training, but he was present with the rest of his team-mates as they travelled to Spain on Tuesday morning. Mbappe sustained an injury during a PSG training session on Monday morning and subsequently underwent a series of medical exams to assess the damage. GOAL can confirm that the initial medical checks have not revealed a fracture, with the club releasing an update on his condition via their website: ""Kylian Mbappe received a shock on his left foot during training today. He was treated this afternoon. ""The clinical examination is reassuring and a new assessment will be made in 24 hours."" 🆕✈️📸 Direction 𝙼𝚊𝚍𝚛𝚒𝚍 ! #RMPSG pic.twitter.com/PvlghN2oAk Mbappe has now been named in PSG's squad for the second leg of their tie with Madrid, which is due to take place at Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday night. 🆗🗒️ Le groupe parisien pour le déplacement à Madrid ! #RMPSG He subsequently was able to train normally on Tuesday, with no suggestion that his left foot was bothering him. Mbappe was absent from PSG's most recent Ligue 1 fixture on Saturday due to suspension. Lionel Messi took the World Cup winner's spot in the number nine role but the French giants suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat at Nice, and Pochettino will be glad to have his top scorer available for selection again in Madrid. Mbappe has 24 goals to his name from 34 appearances for PSG this term, and it has been suggested that the outcome of the Champions League clash with the Blancos will have a major bearing on his future. GOAL has reported that Madrid are confident of signing Mbappe on a free transfer when his contract expires this summer, but PSG haven't given up on tying him down to fresh terms and their chances of reaching a renewal agreement will surely be boosted if he can help them knock the Liga giants out of Europe.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mbappe-a-doubt-for-psg-s-champions-league-clash-with-real-madrid-/blt405c841994ca1a8a,James Westwood,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

623,'Maybe he didn't have the confidence' - Koulibaly suggests why Lukaku's Chelsea return failed,"Kalidou Koulibaly has given his view on why Romelu Lukaku's return to Chelsea didn't work out last season, citing a potential lack of confidence as the reason for his struggles at Stamford Bridge. Lukaku returned to Chelsea from Inter in a club-record £97.5 million deal last summer, but has since returned to Inter on loan after an underwhelming first season back in the Premier League. Koulibaly and Lukaku met on the pitch in Serie A with the Senegal defender ending an eight-year stint at Napoli to join Chelsea, and was asked for some thoughts on the Belgian when speaking to press on Wednesday. Koulibaly was complimentary of Lukaku, saying: ""Romelu is a good player, a nice player, a talented player. ""He is very strong and I was used to playing against him in Italy – I think he didn’t like to play against me!"" He added, opening up on his move to Chelsea: ""He scored a lot of goals in Italy and he won the Scudetto with Inter, so when he signed for Chelsea I was not surprised.  ""Last year I think maybe he didn’t have the confidence he needed to play like he wanted. Maybe something else, I don’t know.  ""Football is not all about the pitch, it is also your private life and everything else, so maybe it was something that didn't work with him over here."" After discussing where it possibly went wrong, the 31-year-old was keen to stress that Lukaku is still a Chelsea player and that 'maybe next year or in a few years he will come back and be better'. He added that he believes Lukaku can enjoy a positive season back with the Nerazzurri, but admitted his main focus was on Chelsea's own campaign. He said: ""We have a lot of talents, a lot of good players, a lot of winners, a lot of experienced players, a lot of young players. I wish Lukaku a good season but I wish Chelsea a better season.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/koulibaly-lukaku-chelsea-return/blt8abe2793f2f72b0c,Mitchell Wilks,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5537,Afcon 2021: Eguavoen unimpressed with officiating in Nigeria’s loss to Tunisia,"Nigeria coach Augustine Eguavoen has subtly hit out at the officiating in his side’s 1-0 defeat to Tunisia in Sunday’s Africa Cup of Nations Round of 16 clash. The Super Eagles crashed out of the biennial African showpiece at the Roumde Adjia Stadium, with Youssef Msakni’s 47th-minute strike settling the encounter. To make things worse for the 2013 African champions, referee Maguette Ndiaye gave Alex Iwobi the marching orders following a rash challenge on Msakni. Asked about his review of Ndiaye’s performance, Eguavoen highlighted the decision to send off the Everton man as one of the incidents where the Senegalese arbiter got things wrong on the night. “It’s a little bit difficult, I don’t like to talk too much about referees because they are the masters,” he told the media after the game. “[Alex] Iwobi’s red card was his first foul and it wasn’t intentional also. However, I don’t think a first offence deserves a red card because it wasn’t dangerous play. “And then, right in his face I see one of the gentlest men in the team – [Wilfred] Ndidi got mashed right in the presence of the referee. He had to complain which meant it was a clear foul. “Having said that, we got advantage on breakaways and he recalled it and gave us fouls. When there is a foul and you are in an advantageous position, you let it run. “So, that’s the only thing. Again, the referee is a gentleman so he should be able to control his emotions. Well, it has happened and there is nothing we can do about it.” Notwithstanding Nigeria’s failed expedition in Cameroon, Eguavoen absolved his players of any blame, insisting they gave their all. “We came here with a mission. Round of 16 we all know what it means – you lose you go home; you win you remain in the tournament,” he continued. “That is what we have been singing and we can’t really fault these boys because they gave it all, fought for it and it just wasn’t to be. “A slight mistake from one of our best players – his timing was wrong – that was the only chance they had and they took advantage of it. “I have told the boys don’t bury your heads down because you have given everything.” The Super Eagles are expected to commence preparations for the 2022 World Cup qualification play-off versus Ghana immediately.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/afcon-2021-eguavoen-unimpressed-with-officiating-in-nigeria/blt26935233460ea2a0,Shina Oludare - @sportingshina,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
52,'I look back with a lot of regrets' - Why Everton's teen sensation Jeffers failed to flourish at Arsenal,"At half time in the 2003 international friendly at Upton Park between England and Australia, the entire starting XI of the Three Lions team was substituted by manager Sven-Goran Eriksen, with 11 fresh players taking to the field for the second half. Among them, in the 4-4-2 formation, were two debutant strikers, both of whom had both grown up in Croxteth, Liverpool, and progressed through Everton's academy before moving on to Premier League giants. One was Arsenal forward Francis Jeffers. The other, five years his junior, was a 17-year-old prospect by the name of Wayne Rooney. England went on to lose the game 3-1 in one of their most disappointing results of the 21st century, with the only bright spark coming from a young striker scoring on his debut.  However, it wasn't Rooney who netted – it was Jeffers, who met Jermaine Jenas' cross at the near post to glance a header past Mark Schwarzer in the 69th minute. Flash forward nearly 20 years, and the paths of two debutants have diverged to an extreme degree.  Rooney is retired with honour as England's all-time leading scorer and multiple title-winner with Manchester United, Jeffers has long since faded into obscurity, with his record for England at senior level forever standing still at one game, one goal. It was not supposed to be this way when Jeffers made his debut for Everton as a 16-year-old in a Premier League game against Manchester United at Old Trafford in 1997 – the same age as Rooney would be on his first senior Toffees start five years later. Jeffers was one of English football's hottest young properties in the late 90s and early 2000s.  For the national team's Under-21s, he scored 13 goals in just 16 matches – a record that he jointly held with Alan Shearer for 17 years, before Eddie Nketiah surpassed both in 2020. A fox in the box with an instinctive eye for a goal, he signed for Arsenal in June 2001 after catching the eye of Arsene Wenger. Jeffers cost the Gunners £8 million ($10.7m), which was a sizable fee at the time for a young, inexperienced striker.  However, his chances were few due to multiple injuries, particularly to his ankle and shoulder, and the irrepressible form of Arsenal's first-choice front two, Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord. The lack of opportunities got to Jeffers, and he admits his attitude at Arsenal was not perfect. “I was out partying, living life, tossing it off in training because I always thought I wouldn’t play Saturday anyway,"" he told the Independent in 2014. “Now, I look back with a lot of regrets. “That is where I should have been putting it in more. Wenger gave me a fair crack of the whip. I haven’t got a bad word to say about him. He tells you how it is, one of the only managers I played for who did. “He said there were things going on in my head that shouldn’t have been and that it was an important time in my career. I am not saying I threw it all away, because I had a decent career.  ""I fulfilled a lot of ambitions but I always say it, I know how much ability I had. I’m not soft. I know how good a player I was. One England cap wasn’t enough.” Arsenal won the Premier League in 2001-02, but Jeffers made only six league appearances in that campaign.  He was on the bench as an unused sub when Wiltord scored the goal against Man Utd at Old Trafford that won the Gunners the title.  He made 28 appearances in 2002-03, but only two league starts as Henry and Wiltord proved immovable. This all came after he had played 60 games for Everton by the age of 20, scoring 20 goals.  Even Jeffers admits turning his back on regular Premier League football as a teenager for a bench-warming role at a bigger club was a major mistake. He said in 2017: “I went from being a regular at Everton to going down there and not being able to get into the team.  ""When you’re sitting at home and think back at how your career’s gone, I feel my head was turned. I was only young. It was difficult because I felt Arsenal were the best team in the league at the time. “It was a tough decision for me because I’m an Evertonian, I’d been a season-ticket holder all my life. It was a big decision but one that never worked out for me.” In total, he only played 39 games for the Gunners, scoring eight goals. Jeffers' later career was the definition of nomadic – he played for Blackburn and Sheffield Wednesday, before having spells in Australia, Scotland and Malta after a return to the Premier League with Blackpool failed to materialise. Eventually, Jeffers retired in 2013 aged just 32, after failed trials with non-league clubs Bury and Chester. He even travelled out to Singapore to train with Brunei DPMM, but could not get a deal. Jeffers then moved into coaching, and was most recently first team coach at Ipswich Town. On LinkedIn, he describes himself as having had ""a successful playing career in the Premier League and Championship, as well as representing England.""  Like so much else on LinkedIn, that's not the full story.

10068,"Tap-Ins for Haaland, Excitement and Creativity: What Sávio Can Bring to Manchester City","Sávio has been one of the revelations of the season in La Liga for surprise title challengers Girona. A move to the Premier League is now on the cards in a transfer that should excite Manchester City fans. Sávio may not have arrived in Spain to any great fanfare – after all, he’d just come off a loan spell at PSV, where he managed only eight appearances across all competitions – but Girona coach Michel had a good feeling about the 19-year-old.   After the Brazilian’s hugely promising first six weeks or so in La Liga, which coincided with Girona’s best start ever to a top-flight campaign, Míchel made a radio appearance on El Larguero and provided a little more context to the arrival of their man of the moment.  “The sporting management had been following Savinho since the last Under-20 World Cup,” he said. “We had an excellent image [of him], despite him having just come back from a season without enchanting at PSV; we had the feeling he could be the right player for us. I’ll say one big thing: since Vinícius Júnior’s arrival in Spain, I haven’t seen such a great one-on-one talent like Sávio.”  For a country blessed with such technical talent, that was high praise indeed, and Sávio has continued to excel for a Girona side that is still pushing hard at the top of the table, long after many expected their early promise to fizzle.  But of course, as occurs with virtually any team that comes out of the blue to threaten the status quo, Girona are likely to be picked apart by the vultures of European football. It’s seemingly already begun with Sávio, who has reportedly agreed a move to Manchester City for next season.  Now to address the elephant in the room; yes, Sávio moving to City won’t be even remotely surprising if it happens. In fact, it was probably the plan all along considering he joined City Football Group club Girona on loan from City Football Group club Troyes, who could somehow afford to buy Sávio in the first place in a deal apparently worth up to €12.5 million before loaning him out less than three weeks later.   However, the questionable morality of this kind of club ownership model is a discussion for another time; Sávio’s hardly the one to blame here, rather he’s taken full advantage of the opportunity given to him at Girona and thrived, immediately becoming a key player and establishing himself as one of the most promising footballers in Spain.  Whether he’ll end up staying with City next season or being loaned out remains to be seen, but Sávio’s impact in La Liga this term suggests he’s already capable of being a useful asset to Pep Guardiola in 2024-25 and beyond.  A graceful, brave and exciting winger, Sávio shows the kind of adaptability that could really give him an edge over other wide players as he looks to carve out a career for himself at the very top. During his formative years, he was frequently used on the right in the mould of a modern inverted winger, cutting inside on to his stronger left foot. But at Girona, he’s switched flanks and it’s arguably brought out the very best in him.  While he undoubtedly has the skillset to play on the right and come inside, Sávio’s one-on-one ability and tremendous crossing technique have made him such a potent weapon on the left and something of a throwback, terrorising many defences and goalkeepers with the chipped technique he favours for many of his deliveries into the danger zone. His style resembles more old-fashioned wingers as he’s tallied 15 open-play crosses following a one-on-one duel, four more than any other player in La Liga this season. Those were among his total of 79 open-play crosses, which is the seventh most in the division.  Such a crossing frequency shouldn’t be misconstrued as him being one-dimensional or lacking subtlety, however. Sávio has brought real creative threat to Girona this season; not only is his 28 chances created in open play bettered by only nine players, but those have also led to a league-high seven open-play assists.  What makes that even more impressive is the fact it matches up almost perfectly with his 7.02 open-play expected assists (xA), a model that rewards players who pass into dangerous areas and measures the likelihood of a pass becoming a goal assist. Sávio is well clear of his nearest rival, Ilkay Gündogan (5.16), in that metric, highlighting the danger he brings with his use of the ball. The main beneficiary to Sávio’s effective wing play is Girona’s first-choice centre-forward Artem Dovbyk, a very promising player in his own right. The Ukraine international is enjoying a phenomenal first season in La Liga after being signed from Dnipro-1 in the summer, with his 14 goals bettered by no one else.  Sávio has laid on eight opportunities to Dovbyk in La Liga this term, with only four other wingers, wide midfielders and full-backs providing more chances to a given striker, and none of those have gone beyond nine. Among the same group of players, Sávio’s 2.25 xA for Dovbyk is comfortably the highest and they’ve linked up for a couple of goals.   It’s always helpful when your wide players form a good understanding with the main striker, and this relationship with Dovbyk could be seen as a promising sign for City fans; obviously no two players are exactly alike, but there are undoubtedly similarities in style between Dovbyk and Erling Haaland, with the Ukrainian’s statistical output this term rated as being more comparable to Haaland’s past four campaigns by the Opta Radar below.   But again, this relationship with the big man up top needn’t be perceived as some kind of cheap, dirty video game tactic. There are plenty of examples that highlight Sávio’s subtlety; he’s not simply a head-down-and-run type winger. He plays with deliberation, purpose, and with his head up.   There were two particularly notable examples in Girona’s 4-2 December win away to Barcelona. The first saw him take up possession just inside the left side of the hosts’ box and shape for a first-time cross, but his feint allowed space to open up in a central position for left-back Miguel Gutiérrez, who took a touch and shot agonisingly wide of the bottom-right corner.   Then, a little later in the second half, Sávio appeared to size up Jules Koundé and Frenkie de Jong, but instead of dropping the shoulder he got his head up and played an inch-perfect cross right between them into the path of Viktor Tsygankov, who prodded wide from about seven yards out.  Another key feature of his game is darting runs onto through balls in behind the full-back. Such a move tore Sevilla open in the recent battering of Quique Sánchez Flores’ side, with Sávio luring Tanguy Nianzou out wide before bursting away from him in an instant to collect a pass and tee up Tsygankov for an easy finish.  There were similar instances against Barcelona and Atlético Madrid, the latter example coming from the right flank, both of which were let down by poor finishes from Dovbyk. This is also evidence of the positivity and drive he can bring in attack, with only six players (minimum 900 minutes played, excluding centre-backs) making more than his 10.7 progressive carries per 90 minutes.   These progressive runs aren’t just limited to the very limits of the pitch, though. Sávio has a regular tendency to pick the ball in deep areas out wide and carry it diagonally infield towards the edge of the box, a feature you’d not tend to associate with wingers of the more throwback variety. It’s effective, though, as his chance-creating carries map highlights, and provides a glimpse of the adaptability mentioned earlier.  He boasts the speed and ability on the ball to exploit spaces and destabilise defences if given opportunities to run at them, with the graphic below showing his run and pass before Tsygankov’s lovely goal against Granada in September.   The trade-off for him being such a reliable creative force on the left is that he doesn’t get many shots away himself. Registering 1.2 attempts on average per 90 minutes this season, Sávio is one of the least productive forwards in La Liga this term with respect to being the one trying to finish chances – that being said, he’s still managed to score five times, which is a solid return.  A lack of shots may simply be an understandable consequence of being a predominantly left-footed player playing on the left wing, and it’s unclear if that’s where he’d be utilised should the move to City come to fruition. Given his impact at Girona, you’d have to say it would make sense, but Guardiola doesn’t really use wingers in that way, and he’s already got Jack Grealish and Jérémy Doku competing for one position on the left.   Perhaps Sávio will be the belated replacement for Riyad Mahrez and, to a lesser extent, Cole Palmer? Stranger things have happened, though it’s difficult to escape the feeling his threat might be dampened somewhat.  Either way, City look to have acquired another fine and exciting young talent for their arsenal, and if any coach can shape Sávio into a world-class player, Guardiola’s the one.   It’s fair to say his next move is going to generate a little more buzz than his last.   Enjoy this?

3181,'Mourinho just turned around and winked' - Khedira reveals special text message on Real Madrid team bus that made big impression,"Sami Khedira has given an insight into the man-management techniques of Jose Mourinho, who he played under at Real Madrid. Mourinho signed Khedira from Stuttgart after the 2010 World Cup, and made the German midfielder a key part of his plans during his time at Santiago Bernabeu. Khedira has revealed how his confidence was boosted by Mourinho, allowing him to play some of the best football of his career, and a special text message made a particularly big impression. The German revealed how, on one occasion on the team bus after a session at a training camp, Mourinho announced he would be in the starting XI with a text message and a wink. ""He texted me, even though he was only two rows in front of me: 'You're a fantastic player, look at my starting eleven for that first game.' I was in the eleven,"" Khedira told ESPN. ""I looked at Mourinho and he just turned around and winked. He gave me so much confidence because I was new to the team, didn't have any friends and could hardly speak English and Spanish."" Khedira played under Mourinho at Madrid for three years before the Portuguese boss left for Chelsea in 2013.  The 2014 World Cup winner stayed for two more years, winning seven trophies with the Spanish giants, including La Liga and the Champions League, before then making the move to Juventus.  The former Germany international would end his playing career in 2021 after spending half a year at Hertha BSC.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mourinho-wink-khedira-text-message-real-madrid-team-bus/blt506d13272e3d27cf,Emma Smith,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4441,"World Cup balls: Al Rihla, Tango, Jabulani & the complete history of official matchballs","The history of the World Cup in many ways tells the story of the evolution of professional football itself. That is visible in the development of the World Cup ball, which has gone from a leather-bound pig's bladder to the high-tech, synthetic spheres we see sold in stores and marketed around the world today. The ball has also played its part in setting the course of World Cup history. From a half-time ball change that influenced a final to the ""supermarket"" model despised by goalkeepers, here is GOAL's history of the official World Cup football. There was no official ball for the first World Cup, held in Uruguay in 1930. Before the final, Argentina and Uruguay argued over who would supply the ball and so agreed to change it at half-time. It may have had a rather substantial bearing on the outcome of the game. Argentina were 2-1 up at the break before the Uruguayans' larger, heavier ball was introduced, and the hosts promptly fired in three unanswered goals to be crowned world champions. Argentina's ball was called the 'Tiento' (pictured without laces), while Uruguay's was a 'T-Model' (pictured with laces). Even balls of the same type were each unique at this time, though, as they were sewn and inflated by hand. They would also get heavier in the rain. Photo credit: Oldelpaso / Wikipedia The second World Cup was held in Italy, which at the time was under the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini. His government produced the Federale 102 ball, though others from England were also used at the tournament. One of the most important innovations it featured was the replacement of leather laces with cotton ones, which were much softer and more forgiving for players heading the ball. But the nature of the way balls were made at this time - by hand, with the skill of the inflater determining how spherical the finished product was - meant that quality control was difficult. That meant that the two captains would be shown a couple of balls before each game and asked to choose which one they preferred. As a result - much to the dismay of Mussolini, you would imagine - the final was played with an English ball. Fortunately, it was good enough for the Italian players to win the World Cup for the first time. Photo credit: MDBR / Wikipedia Allen, a Paris-based manufacturer, had the privilege of being the first company to be allowed to brand their balls when the World Cup came to France in 1938. This was much the same ball as the Federale 102 in Italy. The cotton laces stayed, as did the 13th panel that they were sewn on to (previously, balls had usually been made up of 12). The most significant difference was that the edges of the panels on the Allen ball were more rounded than the Federale, which was a trend that would continue when the sport resumed in full following the Second World War. Once again, though, the Allen ball did not completely dominate the tournament. Other 12 and 18-panel models have been spotted in photographs, with the issue again being that poor inflation of the ball could make it unreliable. Photo credit: MDBR / Wikipedia There was a 12-year wait for the next World Cup after the 1938 tournament due to World War II, and a substantial advance in the production of balls was the result. In actual fact, though, the big breakthrough for the 1950 tournament had been made in Argentina back in the early 1930s and was simply waiting to be cleared for use at a FIFA competition. This ball had been used in the Argentine leagues for several years and was called the 'Superval', later changed to 'Superball' when the company behind it had branched out into Brazil. The innovation was the elimination of the need for skilled inflation experts by creating a completely closed leather sphere without laces. The balls were inflated with a pump and needle through a tiny valve - similar to those still used to this day. The Superball model used at the World Cup in 1950 was the Duplo T and the consistency with which it could be inflated meant that it was the first model to be used uniformly across all matches at a single tournament. Photo credit: MDBR / Wikipedia The World Cup headed for Switzerland in 1954, which meant a Swiss ball manufactured by Basel-based company Kost Sport. Their 'Swiss World Champion' ball took another big step forward by adopting an 18-panel structure, with the panels interlocking together in a zig-zag pattern. That shape would be used in some balls for decades to come. The combination of that structure and a brighter yellow colour makes this perhaps the first ball that begins to somewhat resemble the models that would be used through the 1980s and 1990s. Annoyingly for Kost Sport, FIFA - seemingly randomly - reintroduced their rule prohibiting any branding from appearing on the ball at this World Cup. Photo credit: MDBR / Wikipedia For the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, FIFA took its first steps into opening up competition to supply the tournament ball. They did so by inviting manufacturers to send in unbranded balls along with an envelope stating the company they had come from. A lawyer received all 102 entries and gave them each a number. Then, four members of FIFA's organising committee as well as two Swedish football officials gathered to examine the balls and test them. They narrowed the field down to 10 by lunchtime and a couple of hours later, had selected No. 55 as the official ball of the 1958 World Cup. The winning ball, called the Top Star and made by a company from Angelholm, was the first used at a World Cup to have 24 panels. Each team was supplied with 30, while Brazil took up their option of purchasing more. The Top Star was, in one way, the first ball to be used at more than one World Cup. More on that in a moment. Photo credit: MDBR / Wikipedia Before the Jabulani, there was the Crack. This was the ball selected for the first World Cup in Chile in 1962, and it was not universally well received. The Crack, made by Chilean company Custodio Zamora, had 18 panels but it's defining feature was that they were irregularly divided; some were hexagonal, some rectangular and so on and all were manually sewed together. Not all teams liked it - especially the European ones. The Top Star ball used at the 1958 World Cup had become hugely popular in Europe and 100 were shipped over and used when it was decided the Crack ball was not up to the task. The Crack did feature one important innovation, though, in its introduction of a latex inflation valve that would be adopted by many other models afterwards. Photo credit: MDBR / Wikipedia The ball for the 1966 World Cup in England was selected through a blind test, as had been the case in 1958, and was the first ball to be manufactured by a major modern brand. The English Football Association took several measures to ensure that no one involved in the selection process - which was made at the meeting of the FIFA Bureau in London - could have any prior knowledge of the 111 balls sent in. Forty-eight did not meet specifications and once the remaining field had been narrowed down to eight, two more were found to fail to maintain the required standard over a longer period of testing. In the end, the winner was the Challenge 4-Star ball made by Slazenger, better known for their racket-sports equipment. It was similar to the Top Star but had 25 panels instead of 24. The process of testing and development for the 1966 tournament was by far the most advanced in World Cup history to that point. Four hundred footballs in three different colours were requested for the finals, while each competing national association was sent the ball six months in advance of the tournament to have a chance to get used to it. Photo credit: MDBR / Wikipedia In 1970 came perhaps the most dramatic development in the history of the World Cup ball. That was the arrival of Adidas, who FIFA decided to task with designing the ball for the tournament in Mexico following the success they had enjoyed doing so for the European Cup in 1968 and the Olympic Games, also in Mexico, soon after. As a result, Adidas had the Mexican Football Federation advocating for them. Adidas created the Telstar, which - with its black-and-white panels to improve visibility on television at the first World Cup to be broadcast worldwide - would become an iconic ball. It was not the first black-and-white, 32-panel ball - as had been the case with the first laceless World Cup ball, the Duplo T in 1950, the design had been around for some time in certain European countries. The Telstar, though, saw FIFA latch on to that trend and take it global. The Telstar was such a hit that it was only slightly tweaked, and not completely redeveloped, for the 1974 tournament in West Germany - the home of Adidas. It was renamed the 'Telstar Durlast', but the 'Durlast' part had been present on the 1970 ball. This refers to the coating the ball was given to protect the leather and ensure it held up in wet weather. A thicker coat of 'Durlast' was given to the 1974 ball, giving it its trademark shine. The good news for Adidas is that now they were established as official partners of FIFA, they were permitted to leave their branding on the ball. That made the Telstar Durlast a big seller, with the same ball that was used on the pitch available in stores. The brilliance of Johan Cruyff and the Netherlands at that tournament has served to make it another classic design. Photo credit: WorldCupWiki In 1978, Adidas introduced the Tango - named after the famous dance of hosts Argentina. It has gone on to become one of the most popular balls ever made, but Adidas were evidently somewhat nervy about the introduction of their second World Cup design - they produced a number of 'Telstar 1978' balls as a backup plan. But the Tango took off, ditching the Telstar's black panels for an all-white base with black triangles arranged in a circular pattern, creating a certain effect when the ball rolled across the grass. It sold in huge quantities and quickly became the most recognisable ball in the world. In addition to its iconic design, part of the nostalgia with which the Tango is remembered is down to the fact that it marked the beginning of the end for the leather ball. Adidas did not mess around too much with a winning formula for the 1982 World Cup in Spain, introducing the Tango Espana. The Tango Espana featured certain improvements to the water-resistance and durability of the ball and no longer needed the Durlast coating, as the seams were now welded as well as sewed together. A water-repellent polyurethane layer would be added in 1984, taking us one step closer to the aforementioned death of the leather ball - more in that in the next section. Other than that, the most notable difference was the addition of Adidas' three-leaf - known as 'trefoil' - logo. Photo credit: Warren Rohner The Azteca is not a particularly memorable ball in itself, but is vitally important in the history of World Cup balls for a couple of reasons. For starters, Adidas - having reused the Tango in Spain - once again designed a ball specific to the host country, in this case Mexico. That tradition would continue at every tournament from this point onwards. But more importantly, this was the first synthetic ball to be used at a World Cup. The attraction of synthetic balls was clear: they returned to their original shape immediately after being kicked and tested better than leather balls in just about every aspect, including water-resistance and durability. The design of the Azteca and Adidas' trademark patterns of triangles was inspired by Aztec architecture and murals. Continuing the theme of paying homage in some way to the host country, the ball for Italia 90 was named after the Etruscans, a civilization of ancient Italy. Most notably, the usual Tango-style 'triads' were decorated with the heads of Etruscan lions, a common subject of fine art during the period. Adidas continued to work on the materials and properties of their fully synthetic ball following the 1986 World Cup, with the Etrusco Unico a progression of the Azteca. For 20 years between 1978 and 1998, in fact, there would be very little change in what the official World Cup ball looked like aside from the fact that the original Tangos had been made of leather. Photo credit: warrenski For the first World Cup held in the United States, Adidas introduced the Questra. The theme this time was space travel, which was evident in both the ball's design and the attempt to make it the most futuristic, high-performance model used at a World Cup yet. After a fairly dull tournament in Italy, FIFA hoped to spice things up. The main innovation was a layer of polystyrene foam on the outside of the ball, which was said to make it feel softer to the touch and easier to control while increasing its speed at the same time. The effect was obvious. Not a single team kept a clean sheet in the quarter-finals. Only three of 16 did in the first knockout round. Ironically, the final was one of only three 0-0 draws in the entire tournament but all in all, it was the highest-scoring World Cup since 1982 and featured some spectacular strikes. The World Cup had been broadcast in colour for the first time back in 1970, but it was not until 1998 that the ball followed suit. The Adidas Tricolore, introduced for France 98, was the first ball to take on a multi-coloured design. It retained the Tango triads but, as the name suggests, gave them a red, blue and white flair to match the French flag. There were performance improvements, with the foam layer that had been introduced in 1994 further developed to make the ball softer and faster. But the most notable aspect of the Tricolore was undoubtedly the design and the precedent it set. The introduction of colour opened Adidas' eyes to a world of new possibilities and would see the traditional Tango pattern abandoned at the next World Cup in 2002. Photo credit: Getty Images With the Fevernova, created for the World Cup in South Korea and Japan in 2002, Adidas really started to experiment. They did so firstly in the design of the ball, ditching the traditional Tango look for a blank ball that was given larger green, gold and red triangular patterns. But Adidas also continued to change things up in terms of the ball's technical aspects, with the Fevernova noted by many players for feeling lighter than previous models - despite the fact it hit the upper end of the weight limit imposed by FIFA. David Beckham, an Adidas ambassador who helped to test the Fevernova, backed the manufacturer's claims that this was a ball as precise as had ever been made. Gianluigi Buffon, on the other hand, referred to it as a ""crazy bouncing ball"". Photo credit: Getty Images Teamgeist means team spirit, a tribute to hosts Germany's tradition of collective strength over individual brilliance. The most notable development in 2006 was the introduction of a 14-panel design with fewer seams, which was intended to make the ball rounder and more consistent. It tested better than any ball in the world had at the time of its release. But still, not everyone was happy. Some players complained of a 'knuckleball' effect when the ball was airborne, claiming that its flight was too unpredictable. This was highlighted in the very first game of the World Cup, when Philipp Lahm and Torsten Frings scored spectacular goals that visibly dipped and swerved in the air. Adidas produced a custom ball, printed with the fixture details, for every match of the tournament and also introduced a special gold version - the 'Teamgeist Berlin' - for the final. Photo credit: Getty Images In 2010, things got really interesting. The Jabulani might be the most famous ball ever made - thanks to its notoriety. Adidas attempted to create a ball that was rounder than ever by decreasing the number of panels again, from 14 on the Teamgeist to just eight on the Jabulani. It was viewed as so unpredictable, though, that goalkeepers revolted. Julio Cesar compared the Jabulani to the cheap balls sold in supermarkets, while Iker Casillas called it ""horrible"". It was said to affect passing as well as shooting and a dull, cagey group stage brought the ball in for even more criticism. Adidas countered by claiming they had been testing the ball for six months, and pointed to praise by Adidas-sponsored players such as Frank Lampard and Michael Ballack. In the end, it took a NASA study to get to the bottom of the issue. They discovered that the Jabulani started to 'knuckle' (move in the air) at a higher speed than previous balls because of its smoother surface with fewer seams. That sounds like a good thing in theory, but the problem was that shots such as direct free-kicks tended to travel at that higher speed - making the effect more noticeable in practice. Photo credit: Getty Images The Jabulani had been something of a PR nightmare for Adidas, so for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil they released what they claimed was the most-tested ball ever. It was called the Brazuca, a slang word for 'Brazilian' which, according to FIFA, describes ""national pride in the Brazilian way of life"". It features multi-coloured ribbons that mimic popular Brazilian 'wish bands'. Once again, there was a reduction in the number of panels on the ball, with the Brazuca having just six. It was sent around the world to players, teams and national associations for extensive testing and feedback before the tournament. Adidas even sent a disguised version out to be used in certain league matches. The Brazuca attracted much less controversy and was adopted by a number of club leagues, including the Bundesliga and MLS. Photo credit: Getty Images In November 2017, Adidas released the Telstar 18 - the official match ball of the 2018 World Cup in Russia. A recreation of the first Adidas ball used at a World Cup - the classic 1970 Telstar - it was the first tournament ball since 1994 to be predominantly black and white. The only colour on the Telstar 18 was the gold Adidas, Telstar and World Cup logos printed on the white surface of the ball, with the black sections given a gradient, mosaic effect. Like the Brazuca, the Telstar 18 had just six panels but they were arranged in an entirely new shape and gave the visual effect of being more like the 32-panel 1970 ball. A slightly different version, called the 'Telstar Mechta', was introduced for the knockout stage of the competition. The colourway for the Mechta (meaning 'dream' or 'ambition' in Russian) included red and black on a white background. The ball was extensively tested in the lead-up to the tournament and was used in various youth competitions (with a different design), including the Under-20 World Cup, in advance. Nevertheless, the ball still drew criticism, with Spain internationals David de Gea and Pepe Reina claiming it was 'strange' and that it was more difficult to grip than other balls. Germany shot-stopper Marc-Andre ter Stegen echoed concerns, but conceded that goalkeepers would simply have to get used to it. Photo credit: Getty Images In 2022, the World Cup headed to Qatar and Al Rihla was the official match ball produced by Adidas. The design differs somewhat from previous World Cup balls, with 20 panels used (a jump of 14 from the Telstar 18), but speed and accuracy remain core principles for the manufacturers, with Al Rihla built to maintain high flight speeds. With a CRT Core and textured 'Speedshell' skin, Adidas have sought to ensure the ball suits the needs of an increasingly fast-paced game.  Like a number of its predecessors, Al Rihla, which means 'the journey' in Arabic, incorporates aspects of the host country into the design, with the colours and motifs being a nod to the Qatar flag and architecture of the nation.

985,Inter in advanced talks for Ginter as Nerazzurri eye summer transfer for Gladbach star,"Inter are favourites to land Borussia Monchengladbach defender Matthias Ginter following the defender’s confirmation that he will leave the Bundesliga club after five seasons, GOAL can confirm. The 27-year-old, a member of Germany’s World Cup-winning squad at Brazil 2014, has spent the past half-decade at Borussia-Park, establishing himself as one of his nation’s best centre-backs. But with the news that he will exit North Rhine-Westphalia at the close of the current campaign, clubs have been put on high alert for his services – and the Serie A champions look to be frontrunners for his signature. Ginter confirmed that he would not renew his stay with Gladbach in a lengthy post on social media earlier this week, with the player thanking the club and its fans for making him feeling welcome during his time with them. “After a series of negotiations, I have decided not to extend the contract which will expire in the summer,” the defender wrote on Instagram. “After five excellent years at Borussia Monchengladbach, it is very difficult for me to take this step. “But I have decided to take another path in my career for my personal and professional growth. I owe a lot to Borussia, and I will always have the club and its fans in my heart.” Despite news only breaking this month about Ginter’s future, and with strong interest elsewhere across Europe - including from Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich - it is Inter who look to be in pole position for his services. The Milan side have been in discussion with the player’s representatives since November and are hopeful of wrangling him on a free transfer at the end of the current campaign. The club were reportedly happy to have purchased Ginter for a fee in January, but Gladbach, embroiled in a rough run of form, are not willing to lose any of their key players as they attempt to avoid a relegation battle.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/inter-advanced-talks-ginter-summer-transfer-gladbach/blt40023e4c2b5b30b5,Alessandro De Felice,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1697,France national anthem: La Marseillaise lyrics in full and meaning explained,"France have been one of the most exciting teams to watch in recent times, with the sheer talent of their team earning a World Cup triumph in 2018. With Kylian Mbappe, N'Golo Kante, Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembele in their squad, expectations for Les Bleus are high. GOAL has what you need to know about their national anthem 'La Marseillaise' and more. 'La Marseillaise' is the French national anthem. It was composed in a single night in 1792 by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle in Strasbourg following the declaration of war against Austria by France. The mayor of Strasbourg decided the French troops needed an appropriate marching song, and Rouget de Lisle responded with 'La Marseillaise'. The song was originally titled 'Chant de guerre de l'armee du Rhin' (War Song of the Army of the Rhine'), but the anthem eventually became known as 'La Marseillaise' due to its popularity with volunteer troops from the French city of Marseille. The lyrics of 'La Marseillaise' evoke themes of defiance and strength, urging the French citizens to ""Marchons! Marchons!"", meaning ""let's march"". 'La Marseillaise' was sung by army troops from Marseilles as they travelled to Paris, and is a spirited anthem meant to be sung with passion and enthusiasm, inspiring solidarity within the French people. Originally written as a war chant, the anthem has since served as a rallying cry and an opportunity for camaraderie and harmony. Both France supporters and England supporters sang a rousing rendition of 'La Marseillaise' at Wembley Stadium in November 2015 as a show of unity following the Paris attacks. It made for an emotional showing, with both sets of fans rarely coming together to sing a country's national anthem. “There is a sense in which it is a very violent song, but people have taken it to mean the defense of freedom – that is obviously what is in people’s minds today,” said David Andress, Professor of Modern History at University of Portsmouth, about the anthem. “Music and song are very important cultural forces in generating cohesion. Whether it be national anthems, or religious music, or hymns, or folk songs, there is a very emotional, primal response to singing in union.” The original lyrics to 'La Marseillaise' had six verses, but only the first and sixth verses of the anthem are usually sung at public events. The text of these two verses are shown below, along with an accompanying English translation. Allons enfants de la Patrie,Le jour de gloire est arrive !Contre nous de la tyrannieL'etendard sanglant est leve, (bis)Entendez-vous dans les campagnesMugir ces feroces soldats ?Ils viennent jusque dans vos brasEgorger vos fils, vos compagnes !Aux armes, citoyens,Formez vos bataillons,Marchons, marchons !Qu'un sang impurAbreuve nos sillons !Que veut cette horde d'esclaves,De traitres, de rois conjures ?Pour qui ces ignobles entraves,Ces fers des longtemps prepares ? (bis)Francais, pour nous, ah! quel outrageQuels transports il doit exciter !C'est nous qu'on ose mediterDe rendre a l'antique esclavage !Aux armes, citoyens...  Arise, children of the Fatherland,The day of glory has arrived!Against us, tyranny'sBloody standard is raised, (repeat)Do you hear, in the countryside,The roar of those ferocious soldiers?They're coming right into your armsTo cut the throats of your sons, your women!To arms, citizens,Form your battalions,March, march!Let an impure bloodWater our furrows!What does this horde of slaves,Of traitors and conspiring kings want?For whom have these vile chains,These irons, been long prepared? (repeat)Frenchmen, for us, ah!

11293,Poland 0-2 Argentina: Poland’s Do-Nothing Approach Pays Dividends,"Since the 2010 World Cup Lionel Messi and Robert Lewandowski have scored 195 Champions League goals between them, as many as Chelsea in the same period. The gilded pair led their respective nations as captains this evening, with the Opta supercomputer giving Poland a 66.8% chance of progressing from this group, with Argentina on 80.9%, despite picking up a point fewer in their opening two games. Sometimes heritage really does count, but would it do so in this Group C decider? Lionel Messi had a couple of on-target efforts in the first 10 minutes but neither stretched Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, a man who — in his Arsenal days — conceded twice to Messi in a Champions League game in 2011. Argentina were bossing possession but it took until the 26th minute for them to seriously threaten Poland, with Marcos Acuña screeching one wide after Julián Álvarez had seen a shot saved. Angel Di Maria fired in an Olympic corner and half an hour into the game Argentina had already generated more shots than they did in the entire game against Mexico. Needs must, and all that, but the two-time world champions were looking good. And when you are looking good you probably don’t need the bonus of what is surely one of the softest penalties awarded in World Cup history. Szczesny, coming for a cross, brushed Lionel Messi’s face and VAR pressed the “yeah that’s a pen” button to pretty much universal disbelief outside of Argentina. Justice was done, though, when Szczesny made his second penalty save of the tournament, diving to his left to make a superb stop, one that saw him equal Brad Friedel in 2002 and his fellow Pole Jan Tomaszewski back in 1974 in making multiple penalty saves at a single edition of the World Cup. 2 – Wojciech Szczesny is only the second goalkeeper on record (since 1966) to save a penalty at the World Cup after conceding it himself, after Joel Bats for France against Brazil in 1986. Forgiven. #POLARG pic.twitter.com/vSx7ZQnTQT At the break Argentina had generated seven shots on target; the last side to register more in a World Cup first half were Argentina themselves against Hungary in 1982, a game famous for the fact that the referee allowed Hungary to kick off both halves. No-one knows why. Poland, Szczesny aside, had done little, with Robert Lewandowski making only 11 passes and failing to have a shot. The sight of Messi wasting a classic 0.78 xG penalty must have been particularly painful for Poland’s shot-starved star man. We’ve all been to games where one-way traffic in the first half produces nothing and then that same team scores with their first chance of the second half, and that was precisely what happened here, with Brighton’s Alexis Mac Allister finding the sort of space he insists on in his surname, rifling home on 45:53. It was the first time Poland had conceded a goal at this World Cup and came from the 40th shot they faced. With news filtering through that Mexico had gone one, and then two goals up against Saudi Arabia, Polish fear was growing exponentially. Second place in Group C was slipping through their grasp. Argentina’s % chance of qualifying, according to the supercomputer, had climbed to 97%, while Poland were now sub-50% and below Mexico, in probability if not reality at that point. We then entered one of the strangest yet most delightful scenarios the World Cup can serve up, as, with Poland and Mexico level on points, goals and goals conceded, they were separated on fair play, the same way that Senegal exited the 2018 World Cup at the group stage. Poland were ahead on behaviour, so just needed to not pick up any rash bookings, which made Grzegorz Krychowiak’s yellow in the 78th minute almost as dramatic as conceding a goal. Argentina continued to probe — this game saw them go above 3.0 xG in a World Cup game for the first time in recorded World Cup history, helped by the fact they generated six big chances (but failed to score any of them) — but 2-0 suited them and, in a twisted way, it suited Poland too, as long as Mexico didn’t score again.  And reader, Mexico didn’t score again, in fact they conceded a late goal to Saudi Arabia which ensured that Poland finished second on goal difference, so the number of cards didn’t even matter in the end. Poland could have spent the second half picking up yellows for dissent, foul language, ducking and/or bombing and they would have been fine. Yes, their final shot of the game came in the 53rd minute, yes, they didn’t have a shot on target in the entire game and yes, Robert Lewandowski didn’t have a single shot and only showed signs of life towards the end when he barged Lionel Messi for some reason but the record books will show that Poland made it into the knockout stages of a World Cup for the first time since 1986.  That was a World Cup that turned out pretty well for Argentina, too.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2022/11/poland-0-2-argentina-polands-do-nothing-approach-pays-dividends/,Duncan Alexander,30/11/2022 15:19,the-analyst
5989,Vakoun Bayo: Sporting Charleroi seal permanent deal for Ivory Coast star from KAA Gent,"Sporting Charleroi have confirmed the signing of forward Vakoun Issouf Bayo on a permanent contract from Belgian Pro League rivals KAA Gent. The 25-year-old Ivory Coast international moved to Charleroi at the start of the season from the Buffalos on loan but the two clubs have reached an agreement for the deal to be made permanent until June 2026. “Sporting Charleroi is pleased to announce that it has reached a contract agreement with Vakoun [Bayo],” the club confirmed on their official website. “Bayo is now contracted to us until June 2026 after the club has, at the same time, exercised the purchase option. “Bayo, who arrived this winter from the Buffalos, was quickly unanimous around his qualities as a scorer, planting eleven goals in the space of 17 games, including four assists. “Bayo having become an essential element of the zebra attack, it had become obvious that Charleroi had to exercise its option to buy the six-month loan.” The statement continued: “The staff, the management, the players, and the whole big Sporting family are delighted with the extension of Bayo’s stay under our colors and wish him every success for the rest of his adventures in the Black Country. “Good luck, Vakoun!” Meanwhile, Gent have also released a statement confirming Bayo’s permanent switch to Charleroi. “The 25-year-old Ivorian striker moves permanently to the Black Country after a loan spell,” read part of the statement on Gent’s official website. “Bayo came over from Toulouse in the summer of 2021. In total, he came out in our club colors seven times. “In the winter he went on loan to Sporting Charleroi, which now has the purchase option. The club wishes Vakoun every success in his further career.” Born on January 10, 1997, Bayo is an Ivorian professional footballer, who joined Dunajska Streda in March 2018. He made his Slovak league debut against SK Slovan Bratislava on March 18, 2018. Bayo moved to Scottish Premiership club Celtic in January 2019. He was left out of the Celtic squad for the later stages of the 2018-19 Uefa Europa League, with the club only able to register three of their four January signings. He made his debut for Celtic against Kilmarnock on February 17, 2019, coming on as a late substitute shortly before Scott Brown scored a late winner. On August 12, 2020, Bayo signed for French club Toulouse, on a one-year loan, with an additional option to buy, and on December 22, 2021, he agreed to join Charleroi on loan until the end of the season, also with an option to buy.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/vakoun-bayo-sporting-charleroi-seal-permanent-deal-for-ivory/blt0db7208faec039ee,Dennis Mabuka,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1671,'Man City are the club for Pochettino' - Ex-PSG boss told he could follow Guardiola at the Etihad Stadium,"Mauricio Pochettino has been backed to succeed Pep Guardiola as Manchester City manager by ex-striker Trevor Sinclair. Pochettino is out of a job after he was sacked by Paris Saint-Germain this summer following a disappointing season in which they were eliminated from the Champions League at the last-16 stage. The Argentine had previously been seen as a candidate to take over at Manchester United, but the Red Devils opted to hire Erik ten Hag to assume control this summer. Instead, Pochettino could end up continuing his coaching career with the blue half of Manchester, as Sinclair believes he would be a good option to replace Guardiola. ""You look at him and he knows how to deal with egos. He seems to have a fantastic rapport with players,"" Sinclair said on TalkSport. ""It doesn't matter how big the players are, we have seen him managing [Lionel] Messi, [Kylian] Mbappe and Neymar. So on that side of things, I think he is safe hands.  ""He is a charming man and I think he comes across well in the media. ""I actually feel that Manchester City might be the club for him. I think he might have a bit of a sabbatical now, because I'm sure he is not struggling for finances. ""But I think Manchester City could be the one for him. If Guardiola walks away at a certain stage, that might be a hot seat ready to take for Pochettino."" Guardiola's current contract at City expires at the end of the 2022-23 campaign. The coach will have spent seven years with the club by the time his deal runs out and he suggested last August that he will not commit to an extension. ""Next step will be a national team, if there is a possibility. A national team is the next step,” he said. ""After seven years on this team, I think I’m going to have a stop. I’m going to have to take a break, see what we’ve done. And in the process, I would like to train a South American [team], European [national side], playing a Copa America – I want to have that experience.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-city-are-the-club-for-pochettino-guardiola-etihad/bltbe5d9582e00297ad,Peter McVitie,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Romario made 70 appearances for Brazil between 1987 and 2005, and scored 55 goals for his country. He won the Golden Ball award as Brazil lifted the World Cup in 1994. The former Barcelona player added that he feels that he was at the same level as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Romario also stated his belief that he was a superior player to Kylian Mbappe, Erling Haaland and Luis Suarez. In an interview with Catenaccio e Contropiede, Romario was asked to compare himself with various star names, past and present.  According to Romario, only Diego Maradona and Pele were better than him. Romario was then asked to clarify if he felt that only two players were better than him. He nodded and then said: 'My opinion is this'. As well as Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi, Romario expressed his belief that Brazil legends Ronaldinho and Ronaldo were also at the same level as he was. Romario stated that he was a better player than Rivaldo, Neymar, Adriano, Bebeto and Zico. During his time at Barcelona, Romario won the LaLiga title in the 1993-94 campaign. He also won three league titles and two Dutch Cups when he was at PSV.

11938,Revisited: A Data Journey Through Premier League History,"Join us on a journey through time as we use The Analyst’s unrivalled performance and historical data to uncover the hidden stories buried in Premier League history.  Welcome to The Analyst’s Premier League historical hub where you can find the best stats and insights from every single Premier League campaign.  We analyse the numbers underpinning the ultimate rivalry between Alex Ferguson and Arséne Wenger; delve deep into the era of The Big Four and England’s continental dominance; and explore the tactical star wars within the Guardiola-Klopp rivalry, as Liverpool and Manchester City set record books ablaze. With the help of now nearly 30 years of data, this series will provide the valuable historical context needed to examine each era’s major talking points. How do the iconic early strike partnerships of Cole & Beardsley and Shearer & Sutton compare to those of the modern era? How do those early years of Manchester United dominance stack up when compared to other title-winning teams? Has the Premier League got less and less competitive over time? All these questions, and more, will be answered throughout. Part I starts with 1992-97, the birth of modern-day English Football in the form of the Premier League, and a period that marked the true end of the First Division. Part II examines the era of intense rivalry between Arsenal and Manchester United. Between August 1997 and May 2004, the two clubs shared all seven league titles that were on offer. That is as far as the sharing went. This era was a finite window in a rapidly changing league where the values and intensity of Old Football met the skill and diversity of New Football to produce a titanic struggle between two English heavyweights. Part III charts the emergence of Chelsea under Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and the increasing dominance of the Big Four both domestically and continentally. Part four of our series looks back at the era between 2011 and 2016. After the plodding, metronomic predictability of the last 16 seasons (where only Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea won the title) this era saw a refreshing variety of champions, including two first-time Premier League winners. After crunching our way through 2011-2016, an era of unpredictability, chaos and romance, we move into the current Premier League era. This one is defined by the ascension of Liverpool and Manchester City under the guidance of Jürgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola.  Between them, the pair have shattered records and re-defined the boundaries of excellence within the English game.

742,Bayern Munich most expensive player sales - How Bavarians made over €580 million in outgoing transfers,"Bayern Munich are not a selling club by default.  In fact, their sporting ambitions and success mean they are more of a buying club.  But that is not to say big players do not leave Bayern for pastures new. While some may have been looking for new challenges, some might be moving for sporting or economical reasons. In the summer of 2022, they sold Robert Lewandowski to Barcelona for €45 million in what was a high-profile transfer saga.  It must be noted that while they've sold players like Lewandowski and Toni Kroos, a few like David Alaba and Niklas Sule have left on free transfers.

4216,Bombos vs Barras: Drums return to River Plate in desperate bid to end fan violence,"When one pictures a typically fiery home crowd in South America, a few images immediately come to mind. There's the heat and colour of the flares and pyrotechnics, as well as the bellowed chants which, in turn, declare in turn an undying love for their team and a desire for the worst possible fate to befall their rivals. Finally, in the background, pounding on and on, there are the drums, never falling silent so long as even one fan remains in the stadium to cheer their side on. At River Plate, though, that incessant beat had fallen silent, until Saturday, when, as part of an experiment which could have revolutionary implications for the future of Argentine football, the drums came back, albeit in a new guise rarely seen in the country. It is no easy feat to trace the origin of the bombo (similar to a large bass drum, with a cymbal attached on top), or its introduction in the stands. The instrument first seems to have appeared in the Rio de la Plata region of Argentina and Uruguay around the turn of the 20th century as a part of the Murga street performances, which were (and still are) practised around Carneval, growing in part from the Candombe ceremonies which took hold amongst populations of African descent in the port capitals of Buenos Aires and Montevideo. Those popular origins have remained with the bombo ever since. It is by nature the most democratic of instruments, with no particular training or talent needed to play, other than the ability to keep a rudimentary beat, and that surely has contributed to its universal popularity. Over the years, the instrument transcended Carneval celebration and began to be utilised in political demonstrations of socialist movements and trade unions, and also made the jump over to football, that other great demonstration of working-class exuberance and defiance. For example, Argentina's 'superfan' Carlos Tula, who has attended every World Cup from West Germany 1974 to Russia 2018, plays a drum given to him by former president Juan Domingo Peron. “The bombo is important because it is an instrument of the struggle,” Tula explained to Conclusion. “It used to be the sign of the National Justicialist (Peronist) Movement, when the drum used to sound you would hear, 'here come the scum, here come the Peronists.' ""But that started changing... Now, it belongs to everyone who is out there fighting. ""It is the fighting instrument of the Argentine people out in the street, whatever they are: Peronist, radical, communist.” Cuando la hinchada aparece floja, Tula anima con su bombo...❤️ pic.twitter.com/N3v2YRubGF One extremely literal, infamous example of the use of this 'fighting instrument' came in 1999.  After years of mismanagement in the boardroom, Primera Division side Racing Club were declared insolvent and in liquidation, and, amid intense fan anger, then-president Daniel Lalin attempted to stage a makeshift conference. However, as soon as Lalin started to speak, a bombo flew through the crowd and struck him square in the face, shattering his glasses and leaving a nasty wound.  “That assault made sense,” Lalin, who resigned shortly after, told MDZ Radio on the 20th anniversary of the incident. “If you are a Racing fan and you hear [the team has been liquidated], you're going to lose your mind.” Momento retro en @EfectoSelfieTyC: la quiebra de Racing y la agresión a Lalín el 4 de marzo de 1999. pic.twitter.com/T3ZQevBCgs In terraces across Argentina, however, the bombo was co-opted by the barra brava, organised ultras which evolved from loose groupings of fanatics to highly structured, hierarchical organisations. The barras have been accused of crimes ranging from intimidation and extortion to assault and murder and often have tight links with club administrations, which rely on them to provide support from the stands and in elections in return for financial reward and control of commercial concessions, such as match-day parking, merchandising and ticket resale. It is a lucrative business, to the degree that much of the violence in recent years has been centred not between rival ultras but within bloody internal battles, which have been resolved in some cases with mafia-style hits and shootings. Indeed, at least five of the 19 football-related deaths recorded by anti-violence NGO Salvemos al Futbol in Argentina over the last five years were motivated by clashes between factions of the same club. Removing such a presence from stadiums is no easy task, but it is one River embarked upon in 2018 when the decision was made in the wake of the violence witnessed in the Copa Libertadores final against Boca Juniors to eradicate their Borrachos del Tablon ('The drunks of the stands') barra once and for all. No fewer than 284 individuals were banned from the Monumental and every Argentine ground at the start of 2019, while, in April, a further 319 were added to the list on River's prompting.  “These people bring nothing to River or their members; we will work to make sure they have no place here,” president Jorge Brito vowed. “We want them far, far away... and if others appear they will be expelled from the Monumental and the club.”  In one fell swoop, the Borrachos were banished, taking with them their intimidating control of the terraces, their banners – and their drums. Few River fans wish to go back to the way things were. And yet, while the removal of such a criminal element has been greeted with joy at the club, and attendances are higher than ever – in May, the Millonarios sold out their home ground, all 72,000 tickets, for an 11th consecutive match – the absence of the drums cannot help but be noticed when Marcelo Gallardo's men are going through their paces. However, for Saturday's clash with Lanus, an otherwise fairly routine 2-1 league win, the beat returned to the Monumental stands. This time, though, in the hands of regular fans, members of regional supporters clubs from across the country, who signed up for the scheme to get their hands on a drum prior to the match, after going through careful vetting and criminal record checks.  Once the game was over, the instruments would have to be diligently handed over to River authorities and stowed away for the next clash. ¡Y UN DÍA, VOLVIERON LOS BOMBOS AL MONUMENTAL DE RIVER! #LigaProfesional pic.twitter.com/lq0G06XofM ""It is a practice that seems revolutionary in Argentina and seems impossible,"" Guillermo Madero, a director of Argentina's Security Ministry, which has strongly backed the project, told CNN. ""But has been done all across the world, even in South America."" Some 400 supporters provided the music for the win alongside 40 additional trained musicians and the experiment proved a rousing success. Perhaps nobody was happier than coach Gallardo, who had pushed for the percussion in recent press comments. ""I have already said that our genuine support, from the fan who comes here and celebrates our folklore in the proper manner – that's what I love,” Gallardo beamed. “We needed this chance to feel them accompanying us, I am glad that our people can come happy to the stadium, wanting to have a good time. That is the connection we have with the fans.”  Brito joined the coach in praising those involved, stating on Twitter: “I want to congratulate the River fans, who genuinely and with great effort organised the support from the stands. “Yesterday was an historic day towards an Argentine football without violence.” The real significance of Saturday's events will only be made clear with time. But it represents a true breakthrough against one of Argentine football's most pressing issues. Many supporters maintain a contradictory relationship with their teams' barras. They deplore the syphoning of club funds, and are horrified by the stories of gruesome violence, but admit that it is the hardcore element which 'brings the party' to the stands. It is the chants and music which drives the rest of the ground on to make the national game a truly unique spectacle. If River succeed, though, that mindset may gradually weaken, taking power away from the mafias and handing it back to the regular fans which pay their membership dues every month, attend every game, rain or shine, whether their team be first or 21st in the league.  It may prove nothing more than a flash in the pan – but perhaps this is a tiny step towards placing the bombo back in the hands of the people, and restoring it once more as its universal, democratic instrument of choice.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bombos-vs-barras-drums-return-river-plate-fan-violence/blt7040d95e6e7a93bf,Daniel Edwards,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1854,'Chelsea let football do the talking' - Mount on defeating Middlesbrough despite minimal fan presence,"Chelsea star Mason Mount played down the significance of the club's minimal support from the stands against Middlesbrough, affirming that the Blues let their football do the talking in Saturday's FA Cup victory.  Only around 600 away fans made the trip up to the Riverside Stadium due to ticketing restrictions imposed by the FA prior to the quarter-final clash.  But Thomas Tuchel's men nevertheless progressed to the last four as goals from Romelu Lukaku and Hakim Ziyech sealed a routine 2-0 victory over their Championship opponents.  ""We didn't have many fans here tonight but I felt that we let our football do the talking. We played some good stuff, and that was the main goal for us tonight,"" Mount told the BBC after the final whistle.""We really have that winning mentality within the group. Any competition, any game, we want to win, and we want to keep that going. It's been a tough couple of weeks but for us, as a team, we're just focused and ready to play.""We're so hungry for a domestic title, we just need to keep going. It's not been the best of runs for us at Wembley but we want to right that wrong. We've already had one final at Wembley this season and lost it so we're hungry to win [the semi-final].""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-let-football-do-the-talking-mount-on-defeating/blt3f733aa813f8b09d,Daniel Edwards,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11911,Four and a Half Hours In,"Sergio Leone wanted Once Upon a Time in America to last 269 minutes but was convinced that four hours and 29 minutes was too long to tell a story that spans decades. The 2021-22 Premier League season has been going for about the same amount of time, yet we have barely uncovered even the earliest hints of this season’s storylines. This time in 2020-21 Manchester City and Pep Guardiola were apparently finished as a competitive force and we were set to have more than 300 penalties in a single season. It’s far too easy and tempting to step in too early and draw outlandish conclusions after just a handful of games. THAT SAID: we at The Analyst are lucky to be able to inspect resources like the Premier League Insight feed and use it to make some wiser observations about the first three weeks of the new season. And here they are: Manchester United’s social media did not lament the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009 as there wasn’t any; the club had to wait until Alex Ferguson left four years later before signing up to all your favourite networks. Times change, and so do footballers; Ronaldo is now, like late-era Alan Shearer, mainly a luxury target man, meaning he does his best work in the box, something evidenced by his total of seven headed goals in Serie A last season, more than Arsenal scored as a team in the Premier League. All good: get the ball to Beckham or Giggs to whip some crosses into CR7 and he’ll easily get the 16 goals he needs to join the Premier League 100 club. Oh, I see. That’s right: Manchester United in 2021-22 are possibly the least cross-focused team in the Premier League. They are the only side to average fewer than two of their own players in the penalty area on open-play crosses this season, and only twice have United had four players in the box on an open-play cross. This is a team build for swift counter-attacks, or it has been thus far. When it works, as it did in the opening game against Leeds, it’s spectacular. But sometimes it doesn’t work, and it doesn’t feel like adding Cristiano Ronaldo will make it work more smoothly. Of course, no team is required to choose a tactical approach at the start of the season and then stick with it for 38 games, but to get the best out of their returning veteran superstar, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his coaching staff will need to have done some thinking, because if Ronaldo doesn’t get the service he’s used to, he’ll certainly let them know. As we pointed out in our look back at last season, no club in the English top-flight is more committed to the inswinging corner than Sean Dyche’s Burnley, and once again the Clarets are persisting exclusively with the aesthetically aggressive corner delivery method. All 16 of Burnley’s corners in 2021-22 have been inswingers, with four of them creating goalscoring chances, which is a more than reasonable ratio. There is, though, a new face on the aesthetically aggressive corner delivery scene™, and that face belongs to Steve Bruce. His Newcastle side have been awarded 15 corners this season, and not only have all 15 of them been swung inwards but his side have created six chances from doing so; not only a very profitable avenue but also testament to their manager’s playing days, a central defender who nevertheless scored 19 goals in 1990-91. Merseyside is the spiritual home of the outswinger this season, with Liverpool (81%) and Everton (69%) the teams most committed to that method. The Reds, bolstered by the return of Virgil van Dijk have created seven goalscoring chances from corners in their opening three games, six of those from outswingers invariably aimed towards their Dutchman. Everton, statistically the most effective heading team (in terms of goals) in Premier League history, have seen less success so far, conjuring up just two chances. Meanwhile, Manchester City have taken 30% of the entire total of short corners in the Premier League this season. Pep Guardiola’s team have taken 13 so far, at least 10 more than any other side, so there isn’t even much point in Scott Carson coming up late on in a game if they are trailing. While his appearance as a midfielder for England against Andorra wasn’t an unqualified success, it’s still entirely fair to say that Trent Alexander-Arnold has had a very good start to the season. He leads the Premier League for expected assists, his passing ability being wielded not just on his usual position on the right flank but further infield too, a development which goes some way to explaining why Gareth Southgate deployed him in that unusual position. The Premier League Insight data highlights one of the Liverpool player’s key strengths: snappy passing under pressure. No Premier League outfield player this season has played more passes that have bypassed five or more opponents than Alexander-Arnold (40). He’s ahead of a large group of central defenders, including teammate Virgil van Dijk in ninth. Threaded balls and big switches to the left flank are his stock trade but the other main difference between Alexander-Arnold and the centre-halves beneath him is shown in the average distance of his opponents when he plays the ball, just 3.6 metres for Trent, but 6.8m for Romain Saiss and a massive 8.2m for van Dijk. Not only is the Liverpool full-back a progressive passer but also incredibly incisive with it. 34 Premier League assists at the age of 22 is just the most tangible result. The higher the standard of football, the more inventive the runs made by attacking players are. To watch top-level footballers not only make move after move but be targeted and found by their teammates is to witness a thing of beauty. It takes practice and it takes fitness, so it’s perhaps no surprise to learn that the two players who lead the Premier League in targeted runs this season (that is, runs where they are spotted and searched for by a colleague) are both from Leeds United. Patrick Bamford and Raphinha are different players in a lot of respects, but they are both implicitly trusted by Marcelo Bielsa because they do what he wants them to, and they give everything they have physically to make it so. Liverpool also have two players in the top five, with Sadio Mané and Mohamed Salah once again offering relentless options for their teammates. Trincão of Wolves is also in there, just another example of his team’s almost perfect start to the season in terms of performance, albeit with no points and no goals. Runs are important but sometimes the run of the ball is more so. It’s perhaps premature to label this weekend’s Arsenal vs. Norwich game a relegation six-pointer, but both sides failed to take a single point from their league games in August and a 4+ goal win by one of them on Saturday will mean the other has the worst ever Premier League record after four games. Managers will be blamed, processes will be condemned but some players will be able to hold their hands up and say “guys I did what I could.” Examples could include Pierre Lees-Melou, Emile Smith Rowe and Todd Cantwell who are second, fourth and fifth respectively for pressures in the Premier League this season. If you just take central attacking midfielders then Smith Rowe leads the division with 136, which is a level of effort and commitment that not all Arsenal number 10s have shown previously. Then again, struggling teams tend to have less of the ball so the onus to press the opposition is duly increased. The players who, conversely, have come under the most physical attention from their opponents are from teams like Chelsea, Leicester, Manchester City and Manchester United; all sides who won two of their three games in the opening month.

5114,Inside Ansu Fati's injury nightmare: Barcelona star suffers yet another setback,"An athlete’s worst nightmare is injury and Barcelona starlet Ansu Fati can’t seem to wake up from his. The dream he was living at Barcelona, becoming the club’s youngest goalscorer in La Liga and the youngest ever player to net in the Champions League, among other records, has been ravaged by physical problems. Ansu was only able to play 10 games last season and has featured in the same number so far in this campaign. The 19-year-old insists he will return stronger from his latest setback, a relapse of a hamstring injury, but if he decides to undergo surgery, he will effectively have spent the best part of two seasons on the sidelines. These years are vital for his development, and his tears when he went off against Athletic Club in the Copa del Rey last week showed how painful it is for him psychologically to endure another lay-off, just after fighting his way back onto the pitch. “Unfortunately, I am having to live through the worst part of football, but I will never give up!” wrote Ansu on Instagram, ahead of his camp’s meeting with Barcelona on Monday to discuss the best course of action. Barca’s medical staff say Ansu should have an operation on his hamstring, which he first injured in November against Celta Vigo, and then again last Thursday against Athletic in the Copa del Rey. However, Ansu and his people are reportedly unsure, and have considered a conservative treatment for the injury that would allow him to get back on the pitch sooner, albeit with a higher risk of relapse. The player met with Barcelona on Monday but there was no resolution announced. Ansu’s injury problems began last season when he suffered a meniscus injury against Real Betis. He had surgery on his knee but, although the procedure was completed successfully, the expected four-month recovery period ended up becoming 10 because of complications that led to further operations. Given this frustrating experience, and with a World Cup coming up later this year, Ansu has reason to consider avoiding going under the knife again.  Ansu’s own physio, Joaquin Juan, has recommended that he does not take the operation, according to El Nacional. The meeting ended with the player asking for more time to make his choice, with an outcome expected soon. However, Barcelona are afraid of it becoming a case that could end up like Samuel Umtiti’s. The centre-back, one of the best in the world at the time, decided not to have surgery on an injury so that he could play in the 2018 World Cup with France.  “I had different opinions, a mess in my head, I didn’t know what decision to make,” Umtiti later admitted. He lifted the World Cup in Russia that summer but has never been the same player since. Barcelona are not pessimistic over Ansu’s future to that extent, but their medical team are nonetheless avoid any chance of a repeat. If Ansu follows their advice, his season would be over, but he could start from scratch for 2022-23 and then play his way back into contention for Qatar 2022. Barca believe this is the most sensible course of action as they do not believe that the youngster will be plagued by injuries forever. After all, Lionel Messi had injury trouble in the early years of his career but later became impressively resistant to them. Ansu has probably not been helped by circumstances either, with his relapse happening in a high-pressure knock-out game, in which he played longer than the 30 minutes recommended to Barcelona by the doctors, because it went to extra-time. “We will now get an exhaustive and specific plan in place to ensure that he never gets injured again,” pledged Xavi. ""We need him, we have lost an impressive footballer, so it affects us all, but most of all Ansu. We have to recover him mentally and make him forget about the injuries.” Barcelona have not asked Ansu to adopt a special diet like Messi chose to do in his mid-20s – something he says helped end his own injury issues – although if problems persists, the club might look into it, along with optimising any other external factors they can. Ansu took Messi’s talismanic No.10 shirt and has been heralded the team’s next attacking star, so the relentless injury problems are in danger of becoming too much to bear for the player and fans alike. When he came back for the first time against Levante in September, he was given a hero’s welcome and scored to bring the house down at Camp Nou. But it was a false dawn and has now been followed by another.  For a player this exciting, with so much potential, it’s not just Xavi but the football world as a whole hoping that there won't be any more.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ansu-injury-nightmare-barcelona-star-another-setback/bltf51d2e3ea33733c8,Rik Sharma,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5586,Why is Cristiano Ronaldo called 'El Bicho'? Manchester United star's 'The Bug' nickname explained,"Cristiano Ronaldo is undoubtedly one of the legends of the game. While he is often referred to as the 'G.O.A.T.' (Greatest of All Time) by his fans, he has quite a few other monikers as well.  He has played in four different countries and in Spain, where he has spent the best years of his career with Real Madrid, is fondly known as ""El Bicho'.  Ronaldo spent close to 10 years in Spain and netted 451 times in 438 competitive appearances, averaging more than a goal per game. He was at his brilliant best and went on to win four UEFA Champions League titles and Ballon d'Ors each. He clinched several records and is the club's all-time leading goalscorer and also happens to be the only player in Real Madrid history to score more than 60 goals in a single season.  Ronaldo was a rage amongst Spanish commentators and his goals would follow an elaborate and euphoric commentary. During one such game, Spanish sports broadcaster Manolo Lama coined the term 'El Bicho' during a radio commentary early in his time in La Liga. This means ""The Bug' in Spanish which can frighten and devour opposition defenders.  Ronaldo's incredible dribbling skills and his ability to finish from difficult angles and positions made him one of the most feared footballers on the planet. His quick stepovers in the penalty box or in the wings are a signature Ronaldo move which was a nightmare for defenders. Though his game has changed, he has shown no signs of slowing down and was manchester United's top scorer with 24 goals to his name across all competitions in 2021-22.  Ronaldo has quite a few other monikers barring 'El Bicho'. He is widely known as 'CR7' since his breakthrough at Manchester United and the footballer has gone on to craft an entire global brand around the nickname. He has a wide line of accessories, clothing, and hotel chain that goes by the name CR7. Nike even have their own range of CR7 merchandise, including football boots, balls, and training gear. In 2013, a museum was opened in his hometown of Funchal in Madeira and it is called Museu CR7. Not many know that the galaxy known as Cosmos Redshift 7 or Galaxy CR7 was inspired by Ronaldo. Ronaldo is also known as Mr. Champions League because of his incredible record in the European competition. He has 140 goals to his name and has won the tournament on five occasions.  However, among his family and close friends, he is called by the name of 'Ronnie' or 'Cris.'",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-is-cristiano-ronaldo-called-el-bicho-manchester-united/blt1b98e5c28a369927,Soham Mukherjee,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
2633,'I could see it at close quarters' - Carragher compares Pulisic to Owen as Chelsea star battles pressure of carrying USMNT torch,"Former Liverpool star Jamie Carragher compared the pressure faced by Chelsea and U.S. men's national team star Christian Pulisic with what he saw up close with Michael Owen, who was also tasked with leading both a club and a country at such a young age. Pulisic is the USMNT's big star and arguably the biggest star in American soccer history, having won the Champions League after making the move to Chelsea from Borussia Dortmund. But playing at such a level at such a young age comes with a lot of pressure, and Carragher says he's seen that pressure before in one of his former teammates. While Pulisic's rise has seen him become the torchbearer for an emerging soccer country, Owen's meteoric start to life at Liverpool saw him anointed as England's savior. Having burst onto the scene at Anfield, Owen was thrust into the spotlight at a young age as he was tasked with leading England to glory that, inevitably, never came during his time with the national team. Injuries ended up derailing the later portions of Owen's career, but Carragher remembers back to those early days when it felt like Owen had a country on his shoulders, and he believes that the feeling is similar to what Pulisic may experience at some points as he looks to earn his place at Chelsea. ""We've had situations like that before like with Michael Owen,"" Carragher told GOAL. ""When he first came into the Liverpool team, he was a superstar going to the World Cup at 18, and before you knew it, he felt like he was more England's player than Liverpool's.  ""I think that was a problem for him in his relationship with Liverpool supporters. He was seen as that golden boy of England that was going to take them to the first trophy in God knows how long. I actually roomed with Michael, so I could see [the pressure] at close quarters.  ""With Pulisic, he goes back over to America and hasn't done quite as well as he would have liked in his last few performances certainly. He's not quite fully established himself at Chelsea just yet. I think he's been playing where I've seen sort of snippets and signs in the Premier League but he hasn't fully grasped it just yet and you're always wanting more.  ""I'm not sure if that's the opinion of American fans, but there's no doubt that he is an immensely talented footballer, and a person that can score goals and do some great things but he's just to get across that line and really establish himself in the Premier League and show that he is the main man."" Pulisic, meanwhile, has spoken about how he copes with the pressure of playing for the U.S. and for Chelsea, saying that he finds it important to separate his happiness as a player from his happiness as a person. Pulisic and Chelsea won the Champions League last season, taking down Manchester City in the finale with the American coming off the bench to seal the win. The Blues are still in the Champions League this season, where they will face Lille on February 22 in the first leg of their round of 16 clash. Chelsea are one of several big clubs that have realistic ambitions of winning the Champions League, with the likes of City, Liverpool, PSG, Bayern and Real Madrid among the favorites. But Carragher says that he believes that Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, Neymar and PSG aren't quite at the same level as the other favorites as the round of 16 begins. ""I don't think PSG can win it, even though they have probably the most expensive squad and maybe the biggest names of the competition,"" said Carragher, who will be part of CBS Sports and Paramount+'s studio team for Champions League coverage in the U.S. ""I just don't believe PSG can win the Champions League. ""I think Manchester City can win it because I think they're a much better team than PSG. All the big teams, I look at Liverpool, City, Chelsea, Bayern Munich as the four teams and don't really see any outside of that. ""The only other ones that stand out are PSG and Manchester United, who have spent as much money as anyone in Europe but I don't think they have great teams like the other ones. They have great individuals. ""But that makes me happy in some way because it's not just about individuals and buying expensive players. It's about creating something at a club and managing an atmosphere in a dressing room and that's what I like about the past winners that we've had."" To back his point, Carragher pointed to his famous 2005 Liverpool team that took down AC Milan at Istanbul. Carragher acknowledges that Liverpool did not have the talent of Milan, which featured Kaka, Hernan Crespo, Paolo Maldini, Alessandro Nesta and Andrea Pirlo, to name just a few. ""A lot of times, the best team in Europe doesn't win it,"" he said, ""and I'd say Manchester City have been the best team in Europe judging on how they've done in the Premier League. I don't think anyone has performed better than them.. but the best team in Europe doesn't always win the trophy. ""We were nowhere near the best team in Europe in 2005. We won the competition because we had players better suited to European football than Premier League football. The Premier League was too  physical for a lot of the players in that team, but the continental side with the referees not letting certain things go certainly helped us in 2005 and you need a little bit of luck.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/carragher-compares-pulisic-owen-chelsea-star-battles/blt58983a67d0ef30b7,Ryan Tolmich,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
11408,Mapping out Brazil’s Potential Route to the World Cup Final,"What if Brazil’s preparation for the 2006 World Cup in Germany had been more intense? What if Felipe Melo hadn’t received a red card in 2010? What if Neymar hadn’t been injured ahead of the semi-final in 2014? What if Thibaut Courtois hadn’t saved that shot from Renato Augusto in 2018? Brazil supporters are always looking back at the past, imagining a scenario where the Seleção have already won their sixth World Cup title. But now, with the help of our tournament simulator model, we can estimate the probabilities of the “Hexa” happening in Qatar 2022. Let’s kick off with the group stages. Brazil, as one of the eight teams from Pot 1, were drawn as the top seed into Group G, alongside Cameroon, Serbia and Switzerland. Those opponents shouldn’t be a threat, and the supercomputer agrees. The machine gives Brazil a 67.6% chance of topping Group G, and a very generous 88.5% chance of progressing through to the knockout stages. Such is Brazil’s estimated superiority in Group G, that only Argentina (69.3%) have a better chance than them of topping their group. The supercomputer reckons Switzerland and Serbia will be left to fight for second place in the group. In Russia in 2018, those two countries were also in Brazil’s group and on that occasion, the Swiss progressed to the round of 16. Assuming reality follows what the numbers suggest and Brazil do top their group, it will be a positive indication they are on the right path to the title. Since the introduction of a round of 16 stage at the 1986 FIFA World Cup, the winner of every World Cup has always won its group. The winners of Group G play the runners-up in Group H. Portugal and Uruguay are the favourites to progress in that group, with South Korea and Ghana having less than a 30% chance of going through to the round of 16. Between those two, our model gives Portugal a significant edge, which would put Uruguay in line to face the Brazilians next… Facing a South American nation in the round of 16 may be good news for Brazil. Tite’s side finished their qualifying campaign unbeaten (W14 D3), defeating Uruguay on both times they met: 2-0 away and 4-1 at home. However, things have changed. Brazil won both those matches against Uruguay when Óscar Tábarez was their coach. After Diego Alonso took over the mantle, his side won their last four matches in the qualifiers to secure their spot in Qatar. A round of 16 tie against Uruguay will probably bring back some drama from the Maracanazo in 1950, although Brazil have since defeated the Celeste in the semi-final of World Cup 1970 before winning their third title against Italy. Should Tite maintain his perfect record against Uruguay (W4) in charge of Brazil, their opponent in the quarter-finals will be… Brazil’s quarter-final opponents will be either the winners of Group E or the runners-up in Group F. Spain are slightly favoured against Germany to top Group E, while the runners-up in Group F will be Croatia, according to our supercomputer, with Belgium topping that one. Although Croatia were beaten finalists four years ago against France, the numbers give the edge to Spain in their hypothetical encounter, meaning that La Roja would be Brazil’s quarter-final opponent. The clash would be the sixth between Spain and Brazil in World Cup history, with Brazil only playing Sweden (seven times) more often than Spain. Brazil’s last competitive game against Spain was the 3-0 victory in the 2013 Confederations Cup final. That win against the then-World Cup and European champions sent Brazilians’ hope of a 2014 World Cup triumph on home soil soaring.  But, as we all know, that dream did not have a happy ending. However, 2014 was also the last time that Brazil reached the semi-finals of the World Cup. After three consecutive finals between 1994 and 2002, it’s the closest Brazil have got to winning the title since. Spain and Brazil last met in the World Cup back in 1986. Brazil defeated Spain 1-0 in the first round of the group stage, but both teams progressed to the round of 16, and both were eliminated in a penalty shootout in the quarter-finals that year. After performing below expectations in the last two World Cups, Spain will be keen to eliminate Brazil, but we’re mapping the route of the five-time world champions here, and Tite’s men will progress to the semi-final stage, where they’ll face… The supercomputer projects another South American rival will stand in the way of Brazil’s route to glory. According to the numbers, Brazil will face their neighbours Argentina in the semi-finals. In Group C, Argentina have the highest chance of any side to progress from the group stages (90.2%) according to our model. It’ll be a relief for them, as the runners-up in that group likely face current champions France in the last 16. By topping their group, Argentina would then face Denmark, the predicted runners-up in Group D. In the quarter-finals, their battle would be against the Netherlands from Group A, who would have eliminated the USA in the first round of the knockouts. USA are projected to finish second in Group B, ahead of Wales and Iran. Argentina arrive at the World Cup on the back of a 35-game unbeaten run (W24 D11), the longest in their history. In fact, their last defeat came at the hands of Brazil, a 2-0 loss in the 2019 Copa América semi-final. Brazil and Argentina first met in the World Cup in 1974, with Brazil winning 2-1. After their first encounter, they met again in the following two tournaments at the group-stage level: drawing 0-0 in 1978 and Brazil winning 3-1 in 1982. Argentina’s only victory against the Seleção came in their only knockout clash: a 1-0 win in the round of 16 in 1990. In some ways, this match should be the final. According to our model, these are the two strongest World Cup squads in the tournament and are ranked first and second in terms of their chances of winning the whole thing. It would promise to be an epic encounter. But win that, and the final of the 2022 World Cup would be a replay of 1998. That means… On 18 December 2022 in Lusail, the Seleção will walk out against the current holders France. After a painful defeat in 1998 that gave France their first World Cup title, Brazil would have the chance to avenge their former manager Mário Zagallo. Les Bleus will likely have to face Mexico in the last 16, before two all-European contests in the next two rounds. Their quarter-final opponent could be England (projected to knockout Senegal) and the semi-final would be a titanic clash against four-time winners Germany. France are Brazil’s kryptonite in the World Cup. After being eliminated by the Brazilians in the 1958 semi-final, they’ve got their revenge on three separate occasions. Besides winning the 1998 title against Brazil in the final, Les Bleus knocked the Seleção out of the World Cup in 1986 and in 2006, both times in the quarter-finals. Only four teams have defeated Brazil more than once in World Cup history, and France are one of them, alongside Hungary (x2), Italy (x2) and Netherlands (x3). But, as detailed in the graphic above, the supercomputer thinks 2022 is Brazil’s time. According to our model, France have an 11.9% chance of winning their second title in a row. It’s the third-highest percentage of any team, but Brazil rank higher. The Seleção are favourites to win in Qatar, with the model giving them a 16.2% chance of lifting the trophy. Brazil won the first World Cup played in Asia and according to our model, they will win the second.

4174,"Football fans 'out of patience' with English game, says MP Huddleston","English football faces future independent regulation after percieved failures over the balance of equality within the game have left fans ""out of patience"". says minister Nigel Huddleston, in the wake of the Crouch Report. The Conservative government have endorsed multiple suggestions from the 'fan-led' review into the state of the game, and now are preparing to implament several of them into action. That includes external regulation of the English football pyramid - and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Sport, Tourism, Heritage and Civil Society Huddleston says now that the public's frustration will be heard. “We’ve all got incredibly frustrated over years, in fact decades, of football recognising it’s got problems and singularly failing to sort them out,” Huddleston was quoted by the Guardian.  “Quite frankly I think the British public, and football fans in particular, have run out of patience and there is a need to intervene."" The Mid Worcestershire MP admitted that there would not be a quick fix in regards to government action, adding: “There are some people expecting this is going to happen tomorrow or next week and there are other people thinking it’s two years but we do have the commitment to get this done before the next election. Elsewhere, Huddleston further outlined the need to ensure any changes safeguarded clubs across the structure, while calling on the Premier League to step up to the plate, adding: ""We want to move forward quickly because we know there’s overwhelming demand for this and we know the problems in football. ""But, if we implemented it tomorrow, we could have exactly the opposite impact of what we are intending: making sure that clubs can survive and that they are financially sustainable.” ""I think the message to the Premier League is quite clear,” he added. ""They need to act sooner rather than later because, otherwise, it will be forced on them through the regulator.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/football-fans-out-of-patience-with-english-game-says-mp/blt761be24807700fbb,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5014,Ajax star Antony targets future Premier League transfer amid Man Utd & Liverpool links,"Ajax star Antony continues to enhance his reputation in the Netherlands for now, but the Brazilian – who has been linked with Manchester United and Liverpool in the recent past – admits that he would like to test himself in the Premier League or La Liga at some stage. No transfer is being pushed for at present by a winger with 21 goals to his name through 72 appearances for Ajax, but future plans are in the process of being drawn up. It is considered to be only a matter of time before a hot prospect is snapped up by a big-spending member of European football’s elite, and the highly-rated 21-year-old says he will be ready when that day comes. Antony told De Telegraaf when asked if he is thinking about another challenge: “Ajax is the place where I feel happy. But of course I sometimes think about the next step that will come. “I think the English and Spanish competitions are wonderful. When the time is right, I hope to be able to play there. When exactly? Only God knows.” Antony has seen his stock soar on the back of eye-catching outings that often see him break out a bag of tricks. He insists that he will not be changing those ways as admiring glances are shot in his direction, with his game all about creativity and entertainment. Welcome to the Brazil national team, Antony 🆕🇧🇷One match, one goal 👍 pic.twitter.com/IQqQ8kdEPQ “There will always be people who think the tricks are really cool and people who disapprove of them,” Antony said when asked about potential tweaks to his approach. “I think my actions are functional, because I want to show the opponent that I'm the boss. And often it results in a goal or an assist. So I don't really care what others think. Regardless of the praise or the criticism, I keep my focus.” As a move to England is speculated on for an exciting youngster, the same is true for his current coach. Erik ten Hag is among those said to be interesting Manchester United as they look to appoint a new permanent manager this summer, with Antony a big fan of the 52-year-old Dutchman who raises the standards of all of those he works with. “He is a great coach, with an eye for detail,” said Antony. “The team is the most important thing, but every player becomes a better footballer under his guidance and through his training. “Since I came he has given me a lot of confidence and believed in what I can do. I am grateful to him for that. I respect him very much.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ajax-antony-targets-future-premier-league-transfer-man-utd/bltd14e03cf79ac3533,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4626,What is a pre-contract in football & when can players sign them? Transfer term explained,"Contracts are always a hot topic of conversation in football circles, with speculation never far away when it comes to fresh terms being signed by superstar performers or lucrative deals being run down towards free agency. Transfers and price tags can be dictated by how long is left to run on any given agreement, with many clubs backed into a corner by those who make it clear that no extension will be agreed. Players who opt against penning more paperwork with their respective clubs will find themselves in a position at some stage where discussions can be opened with other suitors. What, though, is a pre-contract agreement? GOAL takes a look… A pre-contract is an agreement between a player that club that commits to a move being made once the player’s current deal comes to a close. This allows interested parties to line up recruitment business well before it is actually completed, with long-term planning put in place. Said talks can be opened up to six months before the expiration of a previous agreement in alternative surroundings. That rule was put in place as part of the famous 1995 Bosman ruling relating to freedom of movement for professional footballers. Any player running down their deal can now sign for another club with no fee having to change hands. 𝙰 𝚢𝚎𝚊𝚛 𝚘𝚏 𝚞𝚙𝚜 & 𝚍𝚘𝚠𝚗𝚜, 𝚐𝚘𝚘𝚍 & 𝚋𝚊𝚍 𝚖𝚘𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝𝚜, 𝚋𝚞𝚝 𝚘𝚗𝚎 𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚑𝚊𝚜 𝚛𝚎𝚖𝚊𝚒𝚗𝚎𝚍 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚜𝚊𝚖𝚎: 𝚢𝚘𝚞𝚛 𝚏𝚞𝚕𝚕 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚐𝚎𝚗𝚞𝚒𝚗𝚎 𝚜𝚞𝚙𝚙𝚘𝚛𝚝 🖤 🙌🏾 𝚃𝚒𝚖𝚎 𝚝𝚘 𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚔 𝚏𝚘𝚛𝚠𝚊𝚛𝚍 𝚝𝚘 𝟸𝟶𝟸𝟸 ➡️ 𝗬𝗲𝘀𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗿! pic.twitter.com/nICAKe3tPg FIFA regulations state: ""A club intending to conclude a contract with a professional must inform the player’s current club in writing before entering into negotiations with him. ""A professional shall only be free to conclude a contract with another club if his contract with his present club has expired or is due to expire within six months. ""Any breach of this provision shall be subject to appropriate sanctions."" The six-month rule when it comes to discussions regarding a future change of scenery relates to teams outside of the country in which the player plies their trade at that time. Premier League players can, therefore, only enter into talks with interested parties outside of England – with the same regulations applying to those in Germany, Spain, Italy etc. Any player looking to move from one English team to another as a free agent can only open talks after entering the final month of their previous contract – with that effectively delaying discussions until any given season has come to a close. That is because domestic transfers are regulated by individual football associations, rather than world governing body FIFA. The FA in England is eager to ensure that there is no conflict of interest between clubs working under its remit, with mid-season, inter-competition free agent agreements banned as a result. There are a number of high-profile players that are running down their respective deals in 2022. In England, World Cup-winning midfielder Paul Pogba could depart Manchester United as a free agent this summer, while German defender Antonio Rudiger is sparking talk of interest from Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain after opting against the signing of fresh terms at Chelsea. Cesar Azpilicueta and Andreas Christensen are in a similar situation at Stamford Bridge, while Old Trafford is preparing to bid farewell to home-grown star Jesse Lingard at some stage in the near future. There are more household names to be found further afield, with Gareth Bale and Isco approaching the end of their contracts at Real Madrid while over at Atletico, Luis Suarez could soon hit free agency. Another of those to have generated plenty of debate in Spain is Ousmane Dembele, with Barcelona open to the idea of selling the France international winger after failing to get him tied down on a new deal. Arguably the biggest name, though, that is currently free to sign a pre-contract agreement is Kylian Mbappe, with the superstar French forward being heavily linked with La Liga giants Real Madrid as he considers a move away from Paris Saint-Germain.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-is-pre-contract-football-when-can-players-sign-them/blt5d41e839dacbcd34,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1680,Spurs exit Europe after forfeiting final UEFA Europa Conference League group stage game following Covid outbreak,"Tottenham are out of Europe after being forced to forfeit their final UEFA Europa Conference League group stage game against Rennes, with the fixture initially called off due to a Covid-19 outbreak in the Spurs camp. Antonio Conte’s side had been due to host Ligue 1 opposition on December 9, but cancelled the game after a number of players and coaches contracted coronavirus. Rennes expressed their disappointment at the time at seeing the game postponed at such short notice, and European football’s governing body has now awarded them a 3-0 victory as no rearranged date can be set. A statement from UEFA read: “Following several positive cases of Covid-19 that were identified from players and staff of Tottenham Hotspur, the 2021/22 UEFA Europa Conference League group stage match between Spurs and Stade Rennais could not be played. “Based on the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations and given the urgent circumstances of the matter, the ad-hoc chairman of the Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body referred the case to the Appeals Body. The chairman took the following decision: “To declare the 2021/22 UEFA Europa Conference League group stage match between Tottenham Hotspur and Stade Rennais, as forfeited by Spurs who is therefore deemed to have lost the match 0-3.” The result means Spurs will finish third in Group G, ending their continental commitments for 2021-22 with no spot earned in the Europa Conference League knockout round play-offs. Vitesse will move forward to that stage, where they will face Austrian club Rapid Vienna. Tottenham, who only collected seven points in the inaugural groupo stage, can now focus their full attention on domestic matters. They are through to the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup, with London rivals West Ham set to be faced in that competition on Wednesday, while also preparing to enter the FA Cup and chase down a possible top-four finish in the Premier League.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/spurs-exit-europa-conference-league-after-being-forced-to/bltcb06307043222ad1,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

11290,Japan vs Spain: Prediction and Preview,"Group E concludes on Tuesday and all is still to play for, with Spain hoping to secure top spot and Japan just aiming to hold off Germany. Spain control their own destiny and also that of Germany in their final Group E match against Japan, but Koke insists La Roja are not paying any mind to the wider consequences of a potential victory. Luis Enrique’s men only need a point to make sure of their place in the last 16, while a win over Samurai Blue at the Khalifa International Stadium will ensure they go through as group winners. The latter outcome on Thursday would suit Germany down to the ground, as Die Nationalelf – who face Costa Rica simultaneously – can clinch a spot in the next round if they win and Japan lose. If Spain are held and Hansi Flick’s men win, goal difference will come into play for the 2014 champions. There is undoubtedly a perception that Germany crashing out would be good for Spain in the long run, given La Roja’s designs on winning the tournament. But Koke is adamant Spain – who have won their final group game in eight of their past nine World Cup appearances – are only focused on themselves. “Our only strategy is to go out and win the next game against Japan,” he told reporters. “We’ve always done it. Obviously, you do the maths on how the classification would look, but our idea is to respect our opponent by going in to win the games. “It’s the only way to prepare for the game and qualify.” You must allow functional cookies to continue. Providing Spain finish the job and qualify, they will face either Croatia, Morocco or Belgium in the next round. But winning the group would put them on course to face Brazil in the quarter-finals, assuming both make it that far. Koke shrugged off such concerns. “I don’t think we fear anyone,” he continued. “We have the utmost respect for all the national teams. “We don’t think about the quarter-final because first we have to win against Japan. Our idea is to win and then we’ll see who will come. “If Brazil face us in the quarter-finals and we have the fortune to get that far, we will try to get there in the best way. We have the same idea of going to win every game.” Japan’s position in the group is somewhat precarious. Hajime Moriyasu’s side followed up their shock Germany win with a similarly surprising loss to Costa Rica, meaning they will need at least a point against Spain if they are to qualify for the knockout stages at consecutive World Cup tournaments for the first time ever. Even then, a draw might not be enough. Moriyasu is not downplaying the task facing his team, rating Spain as the world’s best. But he believes they can repeat the heroics of their win over Germany. “[Spain] are the best team in the world,” Moriyasu said. “They demonstrate their skill by working together even in ferocious battles. We want to win and get past them. “We shouldn’t be on an emotional rollercoaster. The victories and defeats are in the past and now we start preparing for the next game. “We can have a big win [against Spain] like we did against Germany by making incremental strides.” The odds are stacked firmly against Japan for this game. If they are to get the result they require to go through, Samurai Blue will presumably need to be effective defensively. At the back, Japan will look to the experienced Yoshida, who was excellent on matchday one. And he could be particularly key if Alvaro Morata comes into the Spain starting XI after scoring against Germany. Yoshida won five of his six duels last time out and also plays a key role in Japan building out from the back, as he recorded 122 touches against Costa Rica – Wataru Endo (113) was the only other Japan player to register more than 83. RB Leipzig winger Olmo was heavily involved against Germany. The only non-defender to have more touches than his 70 was Pedri (82), whereas Olmo’s 17 passes in the final third was the most for Spain. On top of that, his two key passes was only bettered by Jamal Musiala (three), and Olmo also hit the crossbar with a fierce first-half strike. He may not have played much in the lead up to the tournament, but he has looked sharp in Qatar – Japan would be wise to pay close attention. Anything other than a Spain victory would be a surprise. La Roja go into the contest with a 67.1 per cent chance of taking all three points, and therefore winning the group. Japan’s win probability is just 12.3 per cent and the draw comes in at 20.6 per cent – Moriyasu would probably settle for the latter, however.",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2022/12/japan-vs-spain-prediction-and-preview/,Devs Someoddpilot,01/12/2022 2:41,the-analyst

5595,Ramsey left out of Juventus squad for pre-season tour of U.S. as Serie A giants look to sell,"Aaron Ramsey's future at Juventus is in further doubt after he was left out of the team for the pre-season tour in the United States. The 31-year-old fell out of favour at the Serie A side last season and spent the second half of the campaign on loan at Rangers. Ramsey was not expected to be part of Massimiliano Allegri's plans again in the coming season and that appears to have been confirmed by the midfielder's absence from the squad for their summer trip. Juve are looking to sell the Wales international before his contract expires next year. Ramsey moved to the Turin team on a free transfer in 2019, signing a lucrative deal that runs until 2023.  He has made 69 appearances in all competitions for the Italians, but recurring injury problems severely hindered his involvement last season before he was sent to Rangers. Adrien Rabiot is another midfielder who has been left at home while the rest of the squad travels to the United States. The Frenchman is absent from the squad for personal reasons. Marko Pjaca has also been omitted because he, like Ramsey, is up for sale, while Filippo Ranocchia is on the verge of joining Monza.

11239,Exceeding Expectations: Croatia’s World Cup Odyssey,"Croatia are just one match away from appearing in a second successive FIFA World Cup final. We take a deeper look at the national team who make clever data-led decisions to enable themselves to compete with the big hitters of international football. Only Argentina stand in the way of Croatia’s second successive World Cup final appearance. The Croatians have already knocked out Brazil and could become just the second side to eliminate both the Seleção and fellow South American giants Argentina from the knockout stages of the same World Cup, after Germany in 2014. As one of the numerous World Cup 2022 participants to have a close relationship with Stats Perform and having Opta data at their fingertips, we analyse how they’ve reached consecutive World Cup semi-finals. No European country has punched above its weight more in world football since the modern-day Croatia returned as a recognised FIFA nation in July 1992. It only took them six years to make a massive impact, with their first-ever World Cup campaign in 1998 ending with a third-place finish. In fact, of the 14 World Cups and European Championships that it’s been possible for them to participate in since 1996, Croatia have only failed to qualify twice – Euro 2000 and World Cup 2010. Croatia is only the 30th most populated country in Europe with a shade over four million inhabitants. It’s a notably smaller population than plenty of UEFA footballing nations that have nowhere near as much success on the international stage. Despite this, the Croatians could become just the fourth European nation to reach consecutive World Cup finals after Italy (1934, 1938), the Netherlands (1974, 1978) and Germany (1982, 1986, 1990). The list of players that Croatia have provided to some of Europe’s biggest clubs across the last 30 years is long and includes top-class talents such as Davor Šuker, Zvonimir Boban, Robert Prosinečki, Niko Kovač, Mario Mandžukić and of course, current players Luka Modrić and Ivan Perišić. So how do nations like Croatia continue to pull up trees and impress on the international stage without the huge pool of players that previous World Cup-winning nations have at their disposal? Top-level preparation helps. Of course, preparation for matches (and penalty shootouts) relies on both top quality and depth of data to analyse. Croatia use many of Stats Perform’s professional tools, such ProVision, to access Opta data using the latest in AI and machine learning to enable them to make intelligent data-led decisions both pre-match and in-game. Croatia are a team who try to build through the lines with a patient and controlled approach, with both Dejan Lovren and Joško Gvardiol comfortable as ball-playing central defenders. But the absolute key to Croatia’s style is the central midfield trio of Modrić, Mateo Kovačić and Marcelo Brozović. At times it may seem that all three are attached to one another by a rope, working in tandem to support different areas of the pitch and constantly breaking up play and exchanging short passes. Most of Croatia’s statistical leaders for metrics at this World Cup are one of that trio. Brozović leads for successful passes (419) and open-play attacking sequence involvements (22), he and Modrić have made the most ball recoveries (39), Kovačić has made the most tackles (15) and has the highest expected assist total (1.09), while no player in the Croatia squad has created more open-play chances than him and Brozović (five). The usual wide midfielders – Perišić and Mario Pašalić are very disciplined and offer defensive support to full-backs Borna Sosa and Josip Juranović. This was seen against Brazil in the quarter-finals, as they doubled up on the South American wide players: Sosa and Perišić on Raphinha and Antony (who came on in the 56th minute) and right-sided Juranović and Pašalić doubling up to stop the threat of the skillful Vinicius Junior and later on his Real Madrid team-mate Rodrygo. The same works in Croatia’s attacking phases of play, with the full-backs working in mini-teams with their wide midfielders to provide support in the final third of the pitch. One of Croatia’s major successes in the quarter-final against Brazil was snuffing out the threat of Vinícius Júnior, as they blocked the Brazilian passing lanes to the 22-year-old and forced him into areas of the pitch that made him less threatening. He only received 14 passes from his team-mates in his 64-minute appearance, and many of his 22 touches were in areas that he didn’t want to be in – farther up the pitch and more central than usual, which nullified his threat to progress Brazil up the pitch with his ball-carrying talents. Like most fortunate enough to reach this stage, it’s true Croatia used up some of their luck against Brazil. Neymar’s goal in extra time came from Brazil’s 10th shot on target in the match, and Croatian goalkeeper Dominik Livaković had one of the games of his life with 10 saves while conceding just once – that superb Neymar individual strike – from an expected goals on target total of 3.2. It’s obvious that the biggest threat to Croatia’s chance of reaching another World Cup final comes via Lionel Messi. The Croatians will need to find a plan and execute it as successfully as they did against Vinícius Júnior last time out. They managed to completely stifle the threat of Messi in their 2018 World Cup group game against Argentina, where they restricted him to a single shot off target in 90 minutes, and it was the game in which the Argentina legend had the fewest touches of the ball (49) and attempted the fewest passes (24) at the tournament. In fact, of every World Cup game that Messi has played more than 70 minutes in, that 2018 meeting with Croatia saw him have the fewest touches of the ball and joint-fewest shots. Both Modrić and Brozović were in Croatia’s central midfield that day. Can they have as much success this time around? Messi often drifts wide to the right to pick up the ball, which might see forward Andrej Kramarić drop deeper to support Sosa and Perišić in taking out the opponent’s main threat. So far at this World Cup, Kramarić has found himself dropping much deeper on the right side than the usual striker would. In the last game against Brazil, none of his 33 touches were in the opposition box, with 17 of these on the right side in the opposition half of the pitch (52%). Croatia are a team that like to get the ball out wide and send in crosses. Of all the teams at the 2022 World Cup, only Mexico (19.7) have attempted more open-play crosses per 90 minutes than Croatia (18.2), while just France (19) and South Korea (11) have created more chances than Zlatko Dalić’s side (10) in this manner. Thirty-eight of Croatia’s 103 open-play crosses (37%) have been via full-backs Sosa (18) and Juranović (20), and no Croatia player has been on the end of the team’s 28 successful crosses more than Perišić (five). Croatia commonly used open-play crossing via their full-backs to their advantage at the last World Cup, and one of the goals that helped them reach the final came exactly in this manner – full-back Šime Vrsaljko’s right-wing cross was cleverly converted by Perišić running inside from the back post to equalise in the semi-final versus England. In that tournament four years ago, Croatia were also one of the most prolific crossing teams from open play, with only Germany (26.3) and Portugal (17.3) attempting more per 90 minutes than they did (16.8). In this year’s quarter-final versus Brazil, we saw Croatia utilise their strength out wide, with only 18.7% of their attacking-half touches coming in the middle third of the opposition half and the remaining 81.3% coming out wide. Compare that to Argentina’s 34.4% central figure in their last match against the Netherlands and we have a clear difference in attacking distribution ahead of this semi. Argentina’s strength is via Messi’s direct running and exceptional ability to thread a pass through opposition defences, which has contributed to them making less than half (8.8) the average of open-play crosses per 90 minutes than Croatia at this tournament. There’s little doubt that this will be Modrić’s last World Cup. The Real Madrid midfielder will be a few months shy of his 41st birthday when the 2026 finals in North America arrive, but his experience at Qatar 2022 has been vital to Croatia’s success. Modrić has made the most World Cup appearances (17) and most appearances at major tournaments (30) for Croatia. He’s started all five of their 2022 World Cup matches and could become only the fourth player to start six matches at a World Cup aged 37 or older, after Brazil’s Nilton Santos in 1962, Italy’s Dino Zoff in 1982 and England’s Peter Shilton in 1990. With an average starting XI of 29 years and 179 days so far at Qatar 2022, Croatia have the third oldest average starting line-up at the tournament behind only Belgium (30y 273d) and Costa Rica (30y 145d). In fact, of the seven teams with average starting XI ages of 29 years or older, they – alongside South Korea – were the only nation to progress from the group stage of these finals. Arguably their three key players in their side could be playing in their last World Cup, with 33-year-olds Perišić and Dejan Lovren also nearing the end of their playing careers. However, this tournament has proved that there’s some fresh talent in Croatian football with 20-year-old defender Joško Gvardiol being one of the standout stars of this World Cup. Including all added time and extra time, Croatia have played the most minutes at this tournament so far (556 minutes, 57 seconds), closely followed by Argentina on 550 minutes and 21 seconds. The Croatians hold the World Cup record for their 778 minutes and 42 seconds played at the 2018 tournament, but with at least 180 minutes of football still to play at this tournament when considering the semi-final, plus either the third-place playoff or final, there’s a fair chance Croatia could break that record once again at Qatar 2022. How will those minutes impact the older legs in the squad? We await the answer. With Croatia’s recent history of extra time in knockout stage matches at international tournaments, there’s every chance this semi-final could go to a penalty shootout. Eight of Croatia’s last nine tournament knockout-stage matches have gone to extra time and four of their last six KO games at World Cup finals have gone to penalties. Luckily for Croatia, they have another goalkeeper who is great at saving them. With his save on Rodrygo in the Brazil shootout to add to the three in their last 16 tie versus Japan, Croatian Dominik Livaković became just the third goalkeeper to save as many as four penalties in shootouts at a single FIFA World Cup tournament, after fellow Croatian Danijel Subašić in 2018 and Argentina Sergio Goycochea in 1990. Having the data at their fingertips on historical placement of penalties by players may have helped Livaković make three saves against Japan in the round of 16 to progress in the shootout. Those three saves equalled the record of Subašić (Croatia vs. Denmark in 2018) and Ricardo (Portugal vs. England in 2006) of penalties kept out in a World Cup shootout. Croatia have won all four of their penalty shootouts at World Cup tournaments, knocking out Japan and Brazil in the last 16 and quarter-finals in 2022 respectively. The only downside ahead of this game is that the only nation to win more penalty shootouts in the competition are opponents Argentina (five).",https://theanalyst.com/eu/2022/12/croatia-world-cup-2022-success/,Matt Furniss,13/12/2022 10:38,the-analyst
11890,How Does Mbappé’s Scoring Rate Compare to Ronaldo and Messi?,"There are three things certain in this world. Death. Taxes. And football pundits discussing the age-old question: who is better, Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi? With Ronaldo’s sensational return to the Premier League and Messi’s surprise move to Paris, that topic has once again resurfaced with added vigour. The pair are obviously two of the best footballers in history. And without a doubt, the rivalry between the pair has spurred each of them onto greatness. But how does the next generation compare?  For a while, it seemed like there was no stopping a young Kylian Mbappé from one day emerging as the next of the world’s best. But now he has a tall, blond rival from Dortmund challenging him for that title. And that might just be the best thing to happen to the Frenchman. But do the statistics support the notion that Mbappé is the heir apparent?  When Mbappé appeared in his first UEFA Champions League final back in August 2020, he was aged just 21 years and 247 days old. For comparison, Messi was 21 years, 337 days old, and Ronaldo was 23 years, 106 days old in each of their first Champions League finals.  Despite ending up on the losing side that day, it felt at the time like Mbappé’s appearance was a coronation for the French youngster, a coming of age and a signal of the changing of the guard.  Messi and Ronaldo’s monopoly on Champions League finals has been strong. Ever since the pair started playing in the top five European leagues in 2003-04, eight out of 18 Champions League finals (44%) featured either Ronaldo or Messi. The 2008-09 final, which is the only instance so far where Messi and Ronaldo have locked horns in the showpiece event, was Messi’s first, at the ripe of age of 21 (21y 337d). Messi scored in that one, a giant header for such a little man, where he rose and hung in the air as if held up by string. If he had not been injured three years previously, he would have probably featured in Barca’s 2006 final triumph over Arsenal, aged just 18 (18y 327d). Funnily enough, that is exactly the same age Patrick Kluivert was when he scored against AC Milan back in 1995. The Dutchman is currently the youngest player to score in a Champions League final. Ronaldo made his Champions League final debut a year before Messi, in 2007-08. He also managed to score in his first final, but unlike Messi, it was not enough to see his side win in regulation time. The game went to the penalties, with Ronaldo ultimately missing his spot kick, but Manchester United won the shootout 6-5. Today, Messi is just over 34 years old while Ronaldo is almost 37. The duo still perform at an incredible level, setting standards that the world has never seen before. That standard includes a run of three consecutive seasons from 2010-11 to the end of 2012-13 in which they both scored 30+ goals in the league. During that spell, Ronaldo scored 40 and 46 goals, while Messi scored 50 and 46. No wonder then, that when Messi and Ronaldo scored 30 and 29 goals respectively last season or 36 and 21 goals in the one before, that those tallies are met with a mere shrug of the shoulders. Overall, since the start of the 2007-08 season, Messi and Ronaldo have scored 30+ goals 16 times in total. These are staggering numbers. So how does Mbappé compare? So far, the striker’s managed to eclipse the 30+ goal mark only once, back in 2018-19, where he played in 29 league games. He was hampered by injury the following season, only managing to play 20 league games, scoring 18 goals in the process.  Last season he plundered an impressive 27 in league play. These are impressive numbers, but they are not quite yet in the realm of Messi or Ronaldo. And now there’s a new face in town, a new nemesis for Mbappé: Erling Haaland. Almost two years Mbappé’s junior, the Norwegian is racing up the scoring charts in alarming fashion.  Looking at the data above, Mbappé’s league goal contribution (combining goals and assists) is just below one goal per game, while Messi leads the way with 1.28 and Ronaldo sits at 1.05. Haaland has scored almost one goal per game, and with assists added on his tally reaches 1.21 goal contributions per game. The graphic below charts the goalscoring efforts of these four players across the top five European leagues by age. It’s very early days, but currently, Mbappé and Haaland are both outscoring the other two at their current ages. Today, Mbappé is almost 23. Messi was that age back in April 2010, while Ronaldo was 23 back in November 2007. Haaland on the other hand will be Mbappé’s age in April 2023. Here’s what this quartet’s figures look like at the age of Mbappé today. Except for Haaland, obviously, as we’re not able to travel to the future. Record At Mbappé’s Age: Mbappé’s 111 goals and 39 assists in Ligue 1 are extremely impressive but might be met with a hint of scepticism. Despite French sides’ successes in European club competitions as well as on a national team level, rightly or wrongly, Ligue 1 is still considered weaker than Premier League, La Liga and Serie A.  Mbappé’s figures so far put him at a total of 150 goal contributions in 155 games. He’s averaged a goal every 97 minutes of action, and a goal contribution every 72 minutes. At this age, Messi was scoring every 122 minutes, while Ronaldo was scoring once in every four hours of football. Due to Messi’s high assist numbers, his overall goal contribution gets closer to Mbappé’s but it’s still not quite enough to match him Haaland’s record on the other hand is phenomenal. If he can keep up the pace he’s scoring goals and delivering assists, we could start seeing him contribute to a goal every 60 minutes of league action. Let’s move away from domestic performances and look at the Champions League: Mbappé’s 27 goals and 17 assists in his 46 games of Champions League football is again impressive. He scores less frequently in this competition than in France, but he provides assists considerably more often. It keeps his goal contribution frequency in line with his Ligue 1 numbers. In Europe, when Messi and Ronaldo were Mbappé’s age, their figures were nowhere close to what Mbappé has achieved in terms of raw individual statistics right now. But again, the numbers point at how crazy Haaland’s start to his career has been. He’s reached 21 Champions League goals in the fewest number of games in history, and he’s averaging a goal every 64 minutes in the most difficult competition in world football. Both Mbappé and Messi reached 21 UCL goals in 40 matches while for Cristiano Ronaldo it took 56 games. It took Haaland just 17 matches.  Let’s introduce expected goals to the narrative. Since we’re evaluating each player’s scoring prowess, xG totals also create a good comparison point. Over the past 11 seasons – i.e back to the point we have concrete xG data – Ronaldo and Messi have scored an incredible 564 non-penalty goals between them. Their combined expected goals figure over that time stands at approximately 453. But the +111 combined xG overperformance is mainly Messi’s doing. The Argentine has scored an incredible 84 goals over his expected goals figure, while Ronaldo’s overperformance is roughly 28 goals. Does Lionel Messi break xG models? Probably. It wouldn’t be fair to compare Mbappé’s and Haaland’s level of overperformance to the others at this early stage in their careers, as the pair haven’t had 11 seasons of top-level football to juice up their numbers. Looking at shot quality (xG/shot), Messi and Ronaldo are averaging 0.13 and 0.12 respectively. For Mbappé this value is 0.18 while Haaland’s 0.23 is almost double that of the two legends. This points to the fact that, so far, both Mbappé and Haaland have chosen their shots well before deciding to fire off a shot. Haaland, in particular, is exceptionally clinical. Since his debut for Dortmund in January 2020, no player in Europe’s top five leagues can better his 29.7% shot conversion (min. 10+ goals).  The “Messi or Ronaldo” debate will never end, not even after they retire. Even Maradona and Pele are still included in that discussion. Despite ageing and seeing their goal numbers reduce relatively speaking, they do not show signs of stopping any time soon. But time goes on, and it won’t be long before football will start looking for its new kings. Mbappé has been on that trajectory ever since we first witnessed him in a Monaco shirt. And Haaland’s rise has been nothing short of astronomical.  Both of their names will be in the spotlight in upcoming transfer windows. Where each decides to go next will probably be the game-changer for their careers and directly affect how the next chapter of football history will be written.

4221,Caf doping official Kabungo dies after Ghana deny Nigeria World Cup ticket,"Zambia Football Federation has confirmed the passing of Confederation of Africa Football’s medical official Joseph Kabungo during the 2022 World Cup play-off fixture between Nigeria and Ghana on Tuesday. The two West African giants went head to head in the return battle and it was the Black Stars who progressed on the away goals rule after managing a 1-1 draw at MKO Abiola National Stadium in Abuja. Zambia FA President Andrew Kamanga has confirmed the incident, involving Kabungo who was on duty as a doping officer. “The Football Association of Zambia joins the rest of the football family in mourning the late Dr Joseph Kabungo,” read part of the statement from Zambia FA. “Dr Kabungo, a Caf/Fifa medical officer was on duty in Abuja for the second leg, final qualifying match between Nigeria and Ghana that ended 1-1.” Faz president Andrew Kamanga has eulogised Kabungo insisting the country had lost one of the game’s leading lights on the continent and beyond. “Today [Wednesday] we mourn the passing of our Caf/Fifa medical officer Dr Joseph Kabungo who was on duty as a Doping officer in Tuesday’s match involving Nigeria and Ghana, and we extend our sincere condolences to Dr Kabungo’s family and the football family at large,” Kamanga explained. “We take note that it is too early to dwell into the nitty-gritty of the cause of his death but will wait for the full report from Caf and Fifa on what exactly transpired. “He was a dedicated and widely loved member of our football community and his impact was vast, having also been part of the 2012 Africa Cup-winning team. His death is a huge loss as Dr Kabungo was a friend and confidant to many generations of players and their families. “Dr Kabungo was a permanent fixture at football events including the Fifa Arab Cup in Qatar which is a precursor for the 2022 World Cup. He was also part of the medical team during Cameroon 2021 [played in 2022] Africa Cup of Nations. “He was one of the outstanding Zambian football personalities that flew the Zambian flag at global football events. We all have to learn from his example of excellence and celebrate his legacy by breeding more hard-working football Zambian administrators.” Meanwhile, the Nigeria Football Federation disclosed Kabungo had died of cardiac arrest. “We are terribly shocked at this sad development. The NFF commiserates with world football body Fifa, the Confederation of African Football, the Football Association of Zambia and the family of Dr Kabungo on his sudden passing,” general secretary Mohamed Sanusi was quoted in a statement made available to GOAL. “His death pains us very much and we are in a state of deep shock.  “However, it is important to state the facts as they are. According to the information from our own medical officer, Dr Onimisi Ozi Salami who was appointed by Fifa as medical officer for the game, Dr Kabungo was found gasping for breath near the dressing room of the Ghanaian team.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/caf-doping-doctor-kabungo-dies-after-ghana-deny-nigeria/bltbddabb95e1b3da31,Dennis Mabuka,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

10242,Brighton vs Tottenham: Prediction and Preview,"After turning a corner with three consecutive wins, Spurs travel to face Roberto De Zerbi’s unpredictable Brighton. We look ahead to what promises to be a goal-filled game with our Brighton vs Tottenham prediction and preview. Brighton and Tottenham return to action after relatively long breaks for Christmas – in Premier League terms, at least – with Spurs enjoying a five-day hiatus since playing on 23 December, and Brighton getting a full week off since their 1-1 draw with Crytal Palace. The fixture list for the festive period has been fairly kind to the hosts, who have another five days before their next game after this one – at West Ham on 2 January. A bit of rest will be welcomed by manager Roberto De Zerbi, who has been navigating his side through an injury crisis of late – something that has severely affected Brighton’s recent form, with his team having won only two of their last 12 league matches. They are still hard to beat, though, losing only two of their last nine Premier League games, those defeats coming away to Chelsea (3-2) and at Arsenal (1-0). That loss at Arsenal was the only time in their last 34 Premier League games that Brighton have failed to score a goal. At home, though, the Seagulls have found the net in each of their last 17 Premier League home games since a 1-0 loss to Fulham in February.  However, they’ve also conceded in each of their last 12 at the Amex Stadium since beating Manchester United 1-0 in May. Up against an in-form Tottenham, who have scored at least once in 19 of their 20 Premier League away games in 2023, including each of their last 15 since a 1-0 defeat at Wolves in March, goals will likely be on the cards here. This game pits two teams together who have had mixed seasons but are still very much within touching distance of where they would like to be in the league standings. A win for either side would therefore be crucial to achieving their goals for the season. With the hosts having fared well at home of late and the visitors boasting a good record on the road, something will have to give at the Amex Stadium. Brighton are unbeaten in their last seven Premier League home games (W3 D4) since a 3-1 loss to West Ham in August, but Tottenham have the best points-per-game away record in the top flight in 2023-24, averaging 2.00 points per game on the road since Ange Postecoglou took over in the summer. Spurs fans may be further buoyed by the fact that three of Brighton’s last four home league defeats have come against London-based sides (Arsenal, Fulham and West Ham). The problem for Postecoglou going into this game is that – as has been the case for a while now – he has a long list of absentees to contend with. On the team news front, there was more bad news on Wednesday when the Spurs manager confirmed that Cristian Romero “had a scan and he’s got a hamstring strain. We’re looking at four to five weeks with him.” With Micky van de Ven still out, Emerson Royal is likely to return at centre-back, where he partnered another full-back in Ben Davies for three games while Romero was suspended last month. They will also still be without the suspended Yves Bissouma, though Destiny Udogie returns having served a one-match suspension against Everton. There is cheerier news up front for Spurs, where Richarlison looks to have shaken off the knock that forced him off in the win over Everton last week. The Brazilian has been on something of a hot streak in front of goal of late, having scored four in his last three Premier League games after only netting twice in his first 39 games for Spurs. Tottenham will be hoping he and captain Son Heung-min can provide the goals here. Son has been involved in eight goals in his last seven Premier League away games, scoring seven and assisting one. His seven away league goals are more than double that of any other Tottenham player this season, with his total accounting for 35% of Spurs’ away goals this term (7/20). Brighton, meanwhile, will be sweating on the fitness of star winger Kaoru Mitoma, who is carrying an ankle injury and facing a late fitness test. De Zerbi will still be without Ansu Fati, Julio Encsio, Joël Veltman, Pervis Estupiñán, Adam Webster, Tariq Lamptey and Solly March. The Brighton manager recently bemoaned the depth of his squad, and he may well be looking forward to the January transfer window opening next week. After winning two and drawing one of their first four Premier League home games against Tottenham, scoring in all four games, Brighton have lost their last two without scoring in either. Indeed, in what was a poor season for Spurs last term, they did manage to do the league double over Brighton. That was the fifth time they have won consecutive games against Brighton; they have never won three in a row against them. Spurs could miss the influence of former striker Harry Kane, who found the net in each of the last six games that Tottenham have scored against Brighton. The last time Spurs scored against Brighton without Kane getting on the scoresheet was almost five years ago, a 1-0 win in April 2019, when the goal came from Christian Eriksen. After winning five of their first six Premier League games of 2023-24, Brighton have slumped to a run of two wins in 12, sliding down the table to ninth heading into this game. They have, however, lost only two of their last nine league games in what has been an inconsistent run for De Zerbi’s side. They have conceded the first goal in each of their last six games, but have taken eight points from those matches. Indeed, only Liverpool (19) have won more points from losing positions in the Premier League this season than Brighton (13). Last time out, they needed an 83rd-minute equaliser from Danny Welbeck to rescue a draw at rivals Crystal Palace. Tottenham hope to have turned a corner, recording three consecutive wins to take them right back into the top-four battle. That run of form comes after a period in which Spurs took only one point from five games, losing four games in which they had scored the first goal. Having extended that run of scoring first in games, Spurs have now scored the opening goal in each of their last 12 Premier League matches. Only Brentford have dropped more points from winning positions in the Premier League this season than Tottenham (16).  Having seen off Nottingham Forest, Newcastle and Everton to make it three wins in a row, Spurs will be hoping they have left that tendency to throw away leads behind them.  The Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score to over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world. Ahead of kick-off in this game, here is the Opta Power Ranking for both sides. The Opta Player Ratings are something we introduced ahead of 2023-24. For a quick primer on how they’re calculated, you can check our explainer here. Before kick-off in this match, here are the top five performing players from both teams in the 2023-24 Premier League according to the Opta Player Ratings: Pascal Groß: 79.5 (out of 100) Evan Ferguson: 75.6 Billy Gilmour: 73.9Igor Julio: 71.3 Jan Paul van Hecke: 71.2  Son Heung-min: 84.6 (out of 100)James Maddison: 76.0Dejan Kulusevski: 75.4Guglielmo Vicario: 71.4Pape Sarr: 70.7 The Opta supercomputer is predicting a very tight game at the Amex, barely able to separate the sides in its pre-match simulations. Tottenham are just about deemed favorites, winning 36.3% of the supercomputer’s simulations, putting them just 0.7% ahead of Brighton (35.6%). That makes the draw only slightly less likely (28.1%). In the supercomputer’s latest round of 10,000 simulations of the 2023-24 season (at the time of writing), the league position in which Tottenham are most likely to finish is fifth (39.4%). Brighton are most likely to finish in eighth (19.9%), though there is also a decent chance of them finishing sixth (15.8%), seventh (18.7%) and ninth (16.5%). Enjoy this?

110,"Coutinho drawing interest from Aston Villa, Everton & Liverpool","Barcelona midfielder Philippe Coutinho is drawing strong interest from England, with Aston Villa, Everton and Liverpool interested, GOAL can confirm. Coutinho would rather move back to England than head to his home of Brazil, and while no formal offer has been made, it seems direct conversations are ahead. The Blaugrana, meanwhile, are eager to offload the player to clear wages as they try to register Ferran Torres and set up other moves. The 29-year-old is starved for playing time having started just 13 matches over the past two league campaigns, while his club is ready to move on to other attacking midfield options as it clears salary from its books. England would provide a familiar home and the chance to resurrect his career. A move back to Brazil is not viable at this moment because of Coutinho's football objectives and wage demands.

4064,"World Cup 2022 Qualifiers in Africa: Fixture times, dates, teams that are playing","The first leg matches of the final round of the 2022 Fifa World Cup qualifiers are about to kick off with mouthwatering fixtures on the cards. 10 of Africa’s best teams return to action for the quest to book places at Qatar 2022. It will be the first time for international football on the continent to take place since Senegal lifted the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations title in February after beating Egypt in the tournament held in Cameroon. GOAL gives you all the information you need to know about the games which will put Africa on a standstill as they bid for the five remaining slots for Qatar. Fixture Date Time Egypt vs Senegal March 25 21.30hrs (SAST) Ghana vs Nigeria March 25 21.30hrs (SAST) Cameroon vs Algeria March 25 19.00hrs (SAST) DR Congo vs Morocco March 25 17.00hrs (SAST) Mali vs Tunisia March 25 19.00hrs (SAST) Egypt and Cameroon will clash in what would be a rematch of the 2021 Afcon final. The first leg between the two sides will be played at Cairo International Stadium and comes almost two months after Senegal beat Egypt. The Teranga Lions beat the Pharaohs 4-2 on penalties following a 0-0 draw after extra time.  Egypt would want to take a healthy first-leg league as they seek to deny Senegal a spot in Qatar. Ghana will be the first team to be at home at Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi in this battle of traditional rivals.  The Black Stars were in the same group as Bafana Bafana from where they secured a play-off spot. They now have Nigeria to deal with in this potentially stormy affair and they will be tested to the fullest. Nigeria were at the last World Cup edition in Russia while Ghana missed that tournament and would be seeking a healthy lead ahead of visiting the Super Eagles in Abuja. Cameroon legend Rigobert Song begins his tenure as Cameroon coach and what a stage to kick off his reign - against Algeria. It will be a monumental test of Song facing Algeria as he seeks to soothe the spirits of Cameroonians who endured the agony of watching their team failing to win Afcon on home soil. The burden to tone for the disappointment lies on Song and his men who start at home at Japoma Stadium before travelling to Algeria.  They face the Desert Foxes looking for redemption after finishing bottom of Group E at Afcon.   DR Congo have not been at the World Cup since 1974 which was their only participation at the quadrennial global football competition.  They now face Morocco in their bid to break that long wait and they start at home at Stade des Martyrs de la Pentecote. They come up against a Morocco side that was in Russia the last time out and reached the 2021 Afcon quarter-finals where they were knocked out by Egypt.  This will be the battle between the Malian Eagles and the Carthage Eagles of Tunisia. They begin their confrontation at Venue Stade 26 Mars in Bamako, before switching battleground to Rades. To reach this play-off stage, Mali emerged from a group that had Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda, while Tunisia saw off the challenge of Equatorial-Guinea, Zambia and Mauritania in their pool.  The West Africans have never been at the World Cup before and Tunisia have been there five times.  All information is accurate at the time of publication.

7603,Football EspaÃ±a on CNN: Real Madrid on course to challenge points records as La Liga title moves closer,"Real Madridâs thrashing of Girona, combined with a defeat for Atletico Madrid and a draw for Barcelona extended their lead over all three of their closest competitors this weekend. As they approach the final third of the season, it looks as if it is theirs to lose.  Currently, Los Blancos are averaging just over two-and-a-half points per game, which should they maintain it, will take them to 96.5 points for the season. Clearly either it will be one of 97 or 96 at this pace, but it would be enough to edit the record books if they carry on, as Football EspaÃ±a noted on CNN while reviewing the game. The top two record points totals came from Pep Guardiolaâs Barcelona (11-12, 100 points) and Jose Mourinhoâs Real Madrid (12-13, 100 points). Guardiolaâs side also racked up 99 points in 2010, but the other two totals (96) that round out the top five also came from Guardiola and Pellegrini. Carlo Ancelottiâs side stand a good chance at this pace of making it into that top five. Much of the focus this year has been on the failings of their rivals, which are no doubt there, but Los Blancos are accumulating points at an almost impossible rhythm too. The show they put on against Girona was evidence they have plenty more to give too, as they moved five points clear. Image via Oscar J.

6600,"Inter, Barcelona, Man Utd, Milan, PSG, Atletico or Spurs - Where next for Dybala after Juventus exit?","Blaise Matuidi was one of many Juventini surprised by the news that Paulo Dybala's contract will not be renewed. ""I don't think it will be easy at all to replace him,"" the former Bianconeri midfielder told the Gazzetta dello Sport. ""He has done fantastic things over the years, the fans adore him and they will never forget him.  “But I am sure he will find a club that will allow him to improve and do well."" Matuidi was certainly correct when he said it will be difficult for Juventus to replace a player who has scored 113 goals in all competitions for the club. However, as Maurizio Arrivabene rather brutally outlined, Dybala was no longer ""central"" to their sporting project after the January arrival of Dusan Vlahovic, meaning retaining the services of an injury-prone 28-year-old on a multi-million euro contract made zero financial sense. Perhaps even more disappointingly for Dybala, he may not find a club perfectly suited to his skillset as Matuidi believes. True, the Argentina international will not be short of suitors, given he will be available for nothing this summer, but he may not have as many attractive options as he would like. As GOAL outlines below, very few top teams presently have either the room or the resources to add Dybala to their squads, even if things could change come the end of the season... Diego Simeone has been following Dybala's career ""since he was a youngster"" and watched with interest as his compatriot began to make a name for himself at Palermo before becoming a star Juventus. However, the Atletico boss lashed out at the media in 2018 when a chance meeting in a Madrid restaurant was portrayed as a surreptitious attempt to lure the forward to Atletico. Given we are in the middle of an international break, it remains unclear what Simeone makes of the latest reporters linking Dybala with a move to the Wanda Metropolitano, but one can be sure that it will come up in his press conference ahead of Saturday's Liga clash with Alaves. Which club needs to sign Paulo Dybala? 🇦🇷 pic.twitter.com/76gfSurdcV All we can say for now is that in spite of Simeone's obvious admiration for his fellow Argentine, it still seems unlikely that Dybala will end up at Atleti. While the out-of-favour Luis Suarez is expected to depart this summer, creating a need to bring in an orthodox No.9, the Rojiblancos are presently well-stocked in terms of playmakers and support strikers. Unless one of Angel Correa, Joao Felix, Matheus Cunha or Antoine Griezmann also departs this summer, Simeone simply could not justify signing Dybala. It was inevitable that as soon as Dybala's imminent Juventus exit was confirmed, he would be linked with Manchester United. After all, he came desperately close to moving to Old Trafford in 2019 as part of a deal that would have seen Romelu Lukaku move in the other direction. Back then, the prospect of leaving Juve had reduced Dybala the tears. But now the idea of ending up at United might provoke the same sadness! However, it would be a surprise if United were still interested in Dybala. He certainly would not resolve any of their problem positions. Granted, United need to strengthen their attack this summer but, with Edinson Cavani set to leave and Cristiano Ronaldo's future uncertain, their focus is on signing a prolific centre-forward, while they are also desperate to replace out-of-contract midfielder Paul Pogba, which is an expensive proposition. So, Dybala just does not fit the bill at all.  United may have become synonymous with bizarre buys, while things could change when the identify of the new permanent manager is revealed, but this particular mooted move just does not make sense at all right now. PSG are tipped to sign every single high-profile player on the market, so it has not come as a surprise to see the Ligue 1 leaders linked with Dybala. Sporting director Leonardo certainly loves shopping in Serie A, while the Parisians snapped up one free agent after another last summer. However, ""the greatest transfer window in football history"" has, thus far, proved an absolute disaster for PSG, who are in utter disarray following their latest Champions League capitulation.  Indeed, while Dybala's wage demands would be absolutely no issue for the capital club – who could also have a massive void to fill in attack this summer, with Kylian Mbappe set to move to Real Madrid – it is impossible to predict PSG's plans right now. We do not even know who the coach will be next season, while the future of the entire Qatari-funded project at the Parc des Princes is shrouded in uncertainty.  As it stands, then, Dybala is not presently high on PSG's list of priorities. According to Dybala's former agent, Barcelona first made enquiries about signing the forward as far back as 2016. Dybala himself admitted not long after that he wanted to play alongside Lionel Messi, but that he could realise that ""dream"" with Argentina. What subsequently became clear, though, was that the pair were incompataible. Dybala even admitted that it was difficult for him to excel in the same side as Messi, which caused quite the media storm at the time, and eventually prompted an apology. So, with Messi having left Camp Nou, maybe Dybala could belatedly arrive? Barcelona do love a good free transfer these days, having been financially decimated by the reckless spending of the previous administration. It also remains to be seen whether Ousmane Dembele will leave the club when his contract expires this summer, and it has not yet been confirmed if Adama Traore's loan stay will be made permanent, so there could be voids to fill in attack. However, Barcelona are flying again under Xavi, thanks to some smart signings and a plethora of promising young players, and the question has to be asked: Is Dybala really suited to the coach's preferred 4-3-3 formation? Indeed, a gambler would probably be more inclined to put money on Messi returning to Camp Nou this summer than Dybala joining from Juve. Paolo Maldini & Co. have done a wonderful job reducing the wage bill at San Siro over the last couple of years, while at the same time transforming the recklessly run Rossoneri into favourites for this season's Scudetto with a plethora of shrewd signings. Could Dybala be the next potential game-changer to arrive? It seems unlikely right now, but it is not beyond the realms of possibility. With Brahim Diaz still only sparkling sporadically, Milan would obviously be interested in acquiring a top-class No.10 for nothing. Salary demands could well prove prohibitive for such prudent employers. However, if Zlatan Ibrahimovic's contract is not renewed, there would at least be room on the wage bill for high-profile player... Tottenham boss Antonio Conte may have left Juventus the year before Dybala joined from Palermo, but Spurs' sporting director, Fabio Paratici, was still in Turin, working alongside Beppe Marotta, as the Bianconeri acquired one of the most promising young players in Serie A. This link, coupled with the aforementioned attempt to sign Dybala in 2019, explains why a transfer to north London is now being touted. Again, though, there are a lot of variables here.  Will Conte stay beyond the summer if his primary transfer targets are not acquired?  And would he even want a support striker like Dybala when he already has a class act like Son Heung-min starring alongside Harry Kane in attack? And what of the England man? Will he leave at the end of another trophy-less season in pursuit of tangible success elsewhere?  Furthermore, would Dybala, at 28, really want to join a club that is unlikely to be playing in the Champions League next season? So many questions, but so little certainty at the moment. It is the move that Juventus fans fear most and, worryingly from their perspective, the one that arguably makes most sense. Dybala wanted to stay in Turin. He is not only upset with his departure, but the way in which it has been handled. Moving to Juve's most hated rivals would, thus, be the perfect way to stick two fingers up at those that discarded him in such a cold and abrupt manner. However, Dybala joining Inter would be about far more than betrayal or revenge. It is probably the most logical move for a player settled in Italy. Remember, Marotta is now Inter's CEO, and he is not just a market maestro renowned for making fantastic free transfers; he is also the man who signed Dybala for Juve. From a squad perspective, the Nerazzurri's primary objective is signing a young striker this summer, with Edin Dzeko having turned 36 earlier this month and now showing his age, but it is worth noting that Alexis Sanchez is set to leave San Siro this summer, thus creating space on Inter's wage bill for another second striker. It is also worth bearing in mind that Inter may even listen to offers for their most valuable asset, Lautaro Martinez, this summer, given his profligacy and the opportunity his sale would present to completely overhaul the attack. Handing Dybala a lucrative contract would obviously represent a risk because of his injury issues, but it might be one that Marotta is willing to take given there would be no transfer fee involved.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/inter-atletico-madrid-spurs-where-next-dybala-juventus-exit/blt86e2811265e7d013,Mark Doyle,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

6293,'Unai Emery is the king of cups' - What makes Villarreal boss so successful in Europe?,"Liverpool are firm favourites to overcome Villarreal and reach the Champions League final but in Unai Emery they face a serial cup-winner, who stunned Bayern Munich and vanquished Juventus as underdogs on the way here. “They have probably the most successful cup competition manager in world football so he knows what he is doing,” warned Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp, fully aware of his opposite number's quality. “Unai Emery is the king of the cups. It is unbelievable what he is doing.” The Basque coach won the Europa League three years running with Sevilla between 2014-16, lifted it a record fourth time last season with Villarreal and in 2019 finished runners-up with Arsenal. Emery also won the Coupe de France and Coupe de la Ligue twice each while in charge of Paris Saint-Germain, and has made a name for himself as a formidable opponent in life-or-death competitions. In domestic divisions, Emery led PSG to Ligue 1 in 2017-18, but apart from that has not enjoyed the same success as he has in tournament football, something he has become a specialist in. One reason is quite simple – desire. At Sevilla and Villarreal in particular, the Europa League has been valued higher than it is at other clubs. It’s a tournament Emery and his teams want to win, while elsewhere it is sometimes held in lesser regard. “I’m in love with the Europa League,” admitted the coach this season, although now his sights are set on a higher goal. Unai Emery has overcome so much disrespect to put Villarreal in this position 🙌 pic.twitter.com/6MPwb1Jrvu He credits a chat with Sevilla’s then-president Jose Maria del Nido in 2013 for changing his mindset. “I told him the objective was to get into the Champions League, like I’d done at Valencia,” said Emery. “He asked me if I had won any trophies. If I had celebrated them. Now I understand why he said that to me.” While some opponents in the competition are playing with their strongest side at the weekend on home soil before rotating in Europe, for Villarreal this year, it’s the other way around.  Without a title challenge to maintain and the top four almost out of sight, all of the team’s hopes of glory are pinned on the cups. None of the XI Emery selected against Bayern in the 1-1 second-leg draw in Munich had started the La Liga clash with Athletic Club four days earlier. The Yellow Submarine, Sevilla and Arsenal are all capable of fighting with bigger, stronger opponents on a one-off basis, but over the course of the season are bound to finish behind giants like Barcelona and Real Madrid, or Liverpool and Manchester City. Villarreal are seveth in La Liga this season and have been hit and miss, but took Chelsea to penalties in the UEFA Super Cup, drew 2-2 with Atletico Madrid twice, and 0-0 against Real Madrid twice. With heavy focus on individual games, Villarreal are capable of battling with any side. A lot of that comes down to Emery’s tactical attention to detail. “We’ve got Unai Emery as the captain leading the ship and he always comes up with a master plan,” forward Arnaut Danjuma told The Guardian. “When you play Juventus in the away leg, you know if you don’t concede they will get a bit impatient. We knew an opportunity would present itself. That’s what happened, what Unai predicted. “He is busy with me on a daily basis and I have a lot of conversations with him about how to better myself. He is a strategy mastermind.” It’s a demonstration of the level of belief the squad have in their coach, which he didn’t get at Arsenal or in Paris, for myriad reasons, including language issues. “I think that a coach’s era at a club doesn’t end when they don’t win titles, but when the squad stops believing in him,” said Emery in 2016. The 50-year-old is keen on giving his players every weapon available to them in terms of information about opponents and drilling specific tactical approaches for different games. While concentration can wane in the league across 38 weeks, the one-off nature of cup games, with everything at stake, is a big incentive to watch the videos Emery and his staff provide and prepare as diligently as possible. “I am sure that whatever situation that could come up for Villarreal in the final was already predicted by Unai,” former Sevilla defender Coke told El Pais after Villarreal beat Manchester United to win the Europa League last season. “He studies each detail on video and then he brings it to the pitch.” As a player Emery loved the sport but was afraid. “I felt the pressure a lot and I was a bit of a coward,” he admitted in his book Winning Mentality. Now, as a coach, his preparation keeps him up until the early hours, covering every base so there’s nothing left to be surprised by or fearful of. The coach and his staff watched their own games four times while at Sevilla, and he is no less thorough now. “The more information you have, the better you can decide,” added Emery at his book launch. “I trust that more than experience, because what worked for you before might not serve you now.” However, for all of his cup successes, there is one significant failure that stands out on Emery’s CV – the historic 6-1 capitulation at Camp Nou that saw his PSG eliminated from the Champions League in 2017 despite arriving with a 4-0 first-leg lead. “From that game, the only thing I’d change is the referee,” griped Emery in 2020, still hurt by his team’s remarkable capitulation. This season he has the chance to heal. The players at his disposal are not as star-studded as those he coached at PSG, but seem more determined to follow his plans to the letter. And that’s just what he needs. He watched and analysed 17 Manchester United games before the Europa League final and will be doing the same before heading to Anfield on Wednesday. Even just watching their last game, where Everton frustrated their rivals by sitting deep and playing to Anthony Gordon to get in behind Trent Alexander-Arnold – a role Danjuma could happily play – Emery will have heaped plenty of ammunition for his players to fire.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/unai-emery-king-cups-villarreal-boss-successful-europe/blte8192120c9c10055,Rik Sharma,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
8011,Barcelona could poach defender from Atletico Madrid this summer,"Barcelona will undoubtedly be doing their shopping in the free agent market this summer, and could well be looking to bring a key player from one of their rivals. The best Atletico Madrid sides of recent years have all featured Mario Hermoso playing well, but he is out of contract this summer.  So far Los Rojiblancos have offered him a new deal on a lower wage than he is currently aware, but as of last month, his agents were looking for exit routes for Hermoso. He has been linked to Aston Villa and Serie A. Gerard Romero now says that the Blaugrana are also keeping tabs on him for the summer. He currently has little intention of signing at the current offer from Atletico, and at the age of 28, could be looking at his last big contract. Hermoso would certainly be a sensible signing for Barcelona if they are to sell a central defender this summer. He is capable of playing out from the back, playing left-back, and pushing into midfield from defence. However it is also true that his best football has come in a back three, where he has more defensive protection. While he can play at left-back, it is not a natureal role for him to get down the line, and should not be considered a Marcos Alonso replacement.",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Barcelona-could-poach-defender-from-Atletico-Madrid-this-summer/3301194,,13-Feb,all-football-app
10888,Would You Like Rice With That? Why Declan Rice Is a Wanted Man,"After leading West Ham United to their first European trophy since 1965, their captain is being linked with a transfer to Arsenal and Man City among others. Speak to anyone about Declan Rice and there is a good chance they will either claim the England international is underrated or overrated. One thing that is for sure about Rice is that he is rated within the game. Reports suggest that the biggest clubs in England all hold an interest in the West Ham captain, with Arsenal and Man City particularly strongly linked, while former Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel apparently wants to take him to Bayern Munich to boost the engine room of the Bundesliga champions. Rice’s star has risen in the Premier League in the last few years, and he also started to make his mark in Europe. He led West Ham to the semi-finals of last season’s UEFA Europa League, and was front and centre as the Hammers won the UEFA Europa Conference League final against Fiorentina in Prague. It was West Ham’s first European final since they were beaten by Anderlecht in the 1975-76 UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup, and their first European trophy since lifting the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1964-65. Rice also played his part for England as they reached the quarter-finals of the FIFA World Cup in Qatar at the end of 2022, averaging more passes per 90 than any of his fellow Three Lions midfielders (68.5), which ranked him 19th across the whole tournament for midfielders who played at least three games. West Ham have held onto their talisman until now, but it seems the player is ready to move to the next level, and should a club offer a significant sum, the Hammers sound like they could reluctantly part with him. The club’s chairman David Sullivan told talkSPORT the day after West Ham’s European triumph: “We promised him he could go. He set his heart on going.” But why is there such a clamour for Rice not seen since people were panic buying during the COVID-19 pandemic? We have taken a look at some key areas that potential suitors will have considered. Rice has developed nicely in his six years as a first-team player at West Ham. He made 26 Premier League appearances in his debut 2017-18 campaign, where he won possession on average 4.6 times per 90. That immediately rose to 8.6 times per 90 the following season as he moved from defence into midfield, and in 2022-23 it was at a whopping 9.2 times per 90. His total of 334 possession wins this season was comfortably the most in the league, with only Manchester City’s Rodri (301) also breaking the 300 mark. He also ended the campaign with more interceptions than anyone else in the Premier League. His 63 was seven more than Idrissa Gueye, Cheick Doucouré and Moisés Caicedo (all 56), though Gueye and Doucouré did register higher per-90 rates (1.9 and 1.8 respectively). Rice also protects the defence admirably. He was only dribbled past 20 times in the league in 2022-23 at an average of 0.6 times per 90. That was a better rate than the likes of Caicedo (0.8), Rodri, Bruno Guimarães (both 0.9), Thomas Partey (1.0), Gueye (1.1), Fabinho (1.3), João Palhinha (2.0) and Casemiro (2.1). Much like a dishonoured Renaissance gentleman, he also likes a duel. Of midfielders to have competed in more than 200 duels in the Premier League this season (the football kind, not the pistols at dawn kind), only Gueye, Jack Grealish, Palhinha and Partey recorded a higher success percentage than Rice’s 58.6. Should Mr. Tuchel be reading, that is also slightly better than Bayern midfield pair Joshua Kimmich (56.4%) and Leon Goretzka (57.9%) managed. Speaking of teams supposedly interested in his services, according to our new radar comparisons, the player in Europe’s top-five leagues Rice’s profile this season is closest to is Arsenal’s Thomas Partey, who is rumoured to be a possible outgoing at the Emirates Stadium this summer. That could perhaps be an indicator as to why Mikel Arteta has supposedly made Rice his top target. Though he may be extremely capable defensively, Rice also isn’t afraid of going the other way. He scored four league goals this season, his best return in England’s top flight, and also produced a marvellous solo effort in the 4-1 Europa Conference League quarter-final second leg victory against Gent, running from his own half before slotting in front of the wild home fans. A beaming Rice told BT Sport afterwards: “When I pick the ball up in those positions and I’ve got all that space to drive into, I feel good. When I’m running at defenders and I’ve got that space to drive with the ball, that’s when I feel like I’m at my best.” His involvement in attacking sequences has been second to none for his club as well, recording 138 overall in the Premier League, the most for any West Ham player in 2022-23. That included 32 shots, 30 chances created and 76 involvements in the build-up to a shot, showing how integral he is going forward as well as in defence. Only Saïd Benrahma (47) and Jarrod Bowen (35) created more chances from open play for the Hammers in the league than Rice, while only those same two players as well as Vladimír Coufal and Aaron Creswell created more than his three big chances. As well as all that, there is more general midfield work to consider. Rice is West Ham’s primary passer of the ball, making almost twice as many as any of his teammates in the Premier League this season. In fact, his 2,083 passes were only behind Rodri, Pierre-Emile Højbjerg and Caicedo for midfielders in the whole league, which is impressive when you consider David Moyes’ side can hardly be described as a possession-based side. Only Nottingham Forest and Bournemouth averaged less possession per game than West Ham’s 41.4%. Does that mean he was giving the ball away all the time? No. Rice completed 88.1% of his passes, eighth in the league for midfielders who attempted at least 1,000 passes. Does it mean he was playing easy passes? No. Only Bruno Fernandes (633) and Rodri (624) attempted more forward passes than Rice’s 607. Does that mean Rice was being aided by space and movement around him? No. Only six players in the league completed more passes when an opponent was within two metres, and it’s not as if Rice was overrun with options to choose from either. West Ham recorded the lowest average passing options (1.08) of all Premier League teams in 2022-23. He also loves to carry the ball. Only Rodri totalled more carries in the Premier League this season (702) than Rice’s 597, and only the Spain international recorded a greater total carry distance among central midfielders. Rice actually has more in him when it comes to carries, which could potentially be unlocked in another setup. He recorded a gigantic 716 carries in the 2021-22 league campaign at 20.3 per 90, while he also had 105 in the Europa Conference League this season. Much like his culinary namesake that can lead to certain people making some terrible jokes (ahem), Rice is dependable, versatile and would be a welcome addition to several different recipes. He is now a European champion as well, and expect some of the continent’s biggest clubs to soon be all over him like white on… well, you know.

8148,Cole Palmer expects âweird feelingâ when he returns to Etihad as Chelsea player,"Cole Palmer admits it will be âweirdâ going back to Manchester City on Saturday as a Chelsea player. Palmer makes a first return to the Etihad Stadium since moving to west London in a surprise switch at the end of the summer transfer window. The 21-year-old cost Chelsea an initial Â£40million with an additional Â£2.5m in possible add-ons, but the deal has proved value for money as Palmer tops the Bluesâ scoring charts with 12 goals. Chelsea v Manchester City â Premier League â Stamford Bridge  âI have been surprised by how well itâs gone here so quickly, but I always back myself to succeed,â Palmer told the clubâs official website. âIâm looking forward to going back to the Etihad. It will be strange, a weird feeling, but Iâm looking forward to it and the teamâs looking forward to it. âIâm very excited to be honest, even though it will be strange. âObviously I played against them at Stamford Bridge, but I think going back to the Etihad will be even stranger.â Manchester City v Sevilla â UEFA Super Cup â Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium  The two teams produced a remarkable 4-4 draw at Stamford Bridge in November when Palmer equalised from the penalty spot in the fifth minute of stoppage time. Ten of Palmerâs Chelsea goals have come in the Premier League and his form has catapulted him into contention for a place in Englandâs Euro 2024 squad this summer. âWhen I made the decision to come down here with my family it was a really tough decision to leave,â said Palmer, who joined City at the age of eight and began the season by scoring for them in the Community Shield and Super Cup final. âBut I felt like I was ready to play week in, week out and showcase my ability. âSo thank you to the club and everyone who has supported me. âItâs down to the manager (Mauricio Pochettino) giving me the freedom, the club giving me the opportunity and the lads, who have been great with me since I came in. âIâve settled fast so Iâm enjoying it here.â Chelsea have had an inconsistent season under Pochettino and are currently 10th in the Premier League, 20 points behind leaders Liverpool and 18 adrift of City. Chelsea v Fulham â Premier League â Stamford Bridge  But successive 3-1 wins at Aston Villa and Crystal Palace, the former coming in the FA Cup, have ensured that Chelsea take on Pep Guardiolaâs English, European and FIFA World Club champions with growing confidence. Palmer said: âThe manager helps us all every day. Little conversations telling us what to do. âWe have meetings and he believes in us and we believe in ourselves. âEveryoneâs going to talk when youâre not doing well, but we just need to try and block it out and focus on ourselves.â",https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/Headline/Cole-Palmer-expects-%E2%80%98weird-feeling%E2%80%99-when-he-returns-to-Etihad-as-Chelsea-player/3302163,,1 day ago,all-football-app
2873,Tuchel confirms Alonso asked for Chelsea exit amid Barcelona transfer links,"Thomas Tuchel admitted that Marcos Alonso has expressed a desire to pursue a move to Barcelona following the 1-0 win against Everton. The Chelsea wing-back was not included in the squad for the visit to Goodison Park amid talk regarding his future.  The Spaniard has long been linked with a summer switch to the Camp Nou side and it now seems imminent that he will be added to Xavi's squad. Speculation regarding Alonso's future reached a climax when he was left out of the Chelsea squad on Saturday afternoon for their season opener on Merseyside. Unsurprisingly, Tuchel fielded a question about the 31-year-old after the match.  The Blues boss responded: “Yes, Marcos asked to leave and we agreed to this. It would make no sense to put him on the pitch today."" Plenty of reports have stated that Alonso is closing in on an agreement with Barcelona which would bring an end to his six-year stay in London. Although, the Spanish side are still struggling to register a few of their new arrivals so the move might not be easy to complete. The desire to bring more new recruits to Stamford Bridge has been widely covered in the last couple of months.  Chelsea continue to test Leicester City's resolve concerning centre-back Wesley Fofana while strikers such as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang have been linked to fill the void left by Romelu Lukaku. Speaking after the match, Tuchel told Sky Sports: “If we can add, we will add. Not necessarily midfielders as a first option but we are open for everything. ""I think we could use new energy, new legs and fresh input to bring us to a new level. If not, then we will push this team but I think we could use some more input and some more quality.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tuchel-alonso-chelsea-exit-barcelona-transfer/bltbc63c86aea838fd5,Ed Mackey,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
1679,Darren Fletcher at Man Utd: What is his role & what does he do as technical director?,"Darren Fletcher has explained a slight change to his role at Manchester United since the arrival of Ralf Rangnick.  The former Red Devils midfielder was given a role as technical director last year but, following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the Scotsman has been seen on the bench next to Rangnick and Chris Armas. Given Fletcher’s senior job title it has confused some as to why he regularly takes training sessions and is seen on the pitch during warm-ups and Rangnick himself admitted last week he didn’t know what his role is. But the 38-year-old has moved to clarify his position.  Speaking at a meeting of the Fans’ Forum, Fletcher explained what his role is and how it has changed since Rangnick arrived.  “With Ralf and his staff coming in, and Michael (Carrick) and Kieran (McKenna) choosing to move on, we had a quick transition process, so part of my role has been to assist with that, both on the training pitch and during games,” he explained.  “I guess that’s been the most visible part for me this season, but that’s really an addition to my overall technical director role. “Probably the key part of the role is taking a holistic view of the path for players from our academy to our first team. That pipeline of academy talent is a massive part of who we are as a club.” Interim Manchester United manager Rangnick was asked about Fletcher’s role last week.  ""Well, I can only talk about what I've experienced in the last 11 to 12 weeks. He has always been part of almost every training session and each game,” he said.  ""Whenever I have had a question about what he thinks, because he obviously knows the players, he has known them for a long time. I could always, and will always, ask him for his opinion. So it is good to have him in the team. ""What is his role with regard to the club? I don't really know, to be honest. I can only tell you what is happening in the training sessions, around the training sessions and around the games. In those areas, it is good to have him on board."" Fletcher was appointed as technical director last March alongside John Murtough who became the club’s first football director. The pair are heavily involved with club recruitment and both were involved in the interview process which brought Rangnick to the club.  Fletcher is particularly involved in getting youth players through to the first team and has a close relationship with head of academy Nick Cox. Speaking further about his role he said: “I’m working closely with Nick Cox, as head of academy, to look at the long-term strategy for bringing players through.  “We have to manage the balance between allowing them to develop and creating the right steps for that, without piling the pressure onto them. “Along with Nick, I’m looking at how we best use the loan system to give academy players invaluable experience at other clubs.  “We currently have 13 young players and academy products on loan and playing regularly in other divisions or leagues. “Hopefully we’ll see players like Brandon Williams, Teden Mengi, Jimmy Garner, Ethan Laird, Tahith Chong, and Amad Diallo reap the benefits of that. All of them are doing really well on loan and we’re excited to bring them back in pre-season to see how they fare with our first-team players. “It’s been a brilliant experience since I took on the role, and the combination of long-term planning and contributing to our strategic goals, with the opportunity to still be close to the team and management, makes it a unique role.”",https://www.goal.com/en/news/darren-fletcher-man-utd-what-is-his-role-what-does-he-do-as/blt744297e2e7bd6dca,Charlotte Duncker,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
5784,Gabriel Jesus Arsenal shirt number revealed in leaked video ahead of £45m transfer,"Gabriel Jesus is Arsenal-bound, with his £45 million ($54m) transfer in the process of being wrapped up, and the Brazil international has been caught on camera at the Emirates Stadium donning his new shirt. The 25-year-old striker has enjoyed five-and-a-half productive years at the Etihad Stadium, scoring 95 goals and collecting four Premier League titles, but the time has come for a new challenge. Following the arrival of Erling Haaland at City, and with competition fierce for other attacking berths, Jesus is ready to continue his adventure in English football with a move to north London. Jesus has been pictured with an Arsenal jersey on his back and, as expected, appears to have been handed Arsenal’s No.9. That shirt has become available in the Gunners’ ranks following the departure of Alexandre Lacazette as a free agent. The France international, who has re-joined former club Lyon this summer, had graced that jersey since 2017-18. Prior to that, Arsenal’s No.9 spot was filled by Lucas Perez, Lukas Podolski, Chu-young Park, Eduardo and Julio Baptista. Heading even further back and the likes of Jose Antonio Reyes, Francis Jeffers, Davor Suker, Nicolas Anelka and Paul Merson have also taken that number in the Premier League era. Jesus is accustomed to having No.9 on his back, having spent the last three seasons filling the role at City, while he has also donned No.33 for the Blues and former club Palmeiras.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/gabriel-jesus-arsenal-shirt-number-revealed-leaked-video-45m/blt8a6628f1e207ad78,Chris Burton,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

10396,Championship Predictions: 2023-24 November Update,"With the table starting to take shape now we’re a third of the way through the season, we looked at the latest Championship predictions for promotion and relegation. Before a ball was kicked in anger across the 2023-24 EFL Championship campaign, we analysed 10,000 season simulations via the Opta supercomputer to assess the teams most likely to win promotion, finish in the top six or be relegated to League One. We’re now over a third of the way through 2023-24, so after 192 matches of ‘real data’ was fed into the supercomputer, how do the projections look now? Back on 31 July, the Opta supercomputer tried to predict the seemingly unpredictable, with the 10,000 pre-season simulations showing that only one of the 24 sides never won automatic promotion, while every single team was relegated at least once. Early season results suggested this Championship season could be one of the most unpredictable yet, with Preston North End leading the league at the first international break and Middlesbrough bottom after five games. With all teams now 16 matches into 2023-24, we all have a better picture of where each team is at and their chances of success or failure. Here, we run you through the key results of the Opta supercomputer Championship 2023-24 simulations as they stand in mid-November, during the third international break of the season. Leicester City can put the champagne on ice. Well, maybe not, because it’ll melt between now and May, but you know what we mean. Enzo Maresca’s side have enjoyed an exceptional start to the Championship season, despite losing their final two games before the November international break versus other top-six contenders Leeds United and Middlesbrough. Nevertheless, they still sit top of the table on goal difference with 39 points from a possible 48. Importantly, the gap between them and third-place Leeds is eight points. Ipswich Town are also on 39 points after an exceptional start to life back in the Championship following their League One promotion in 2022-23. Kieran McKenna – the second youngest coach in the Championship – is making waves as one of the most impressive managers in the English Football League. Much of Ipswich’s potential success in the remaining months of the season hinge on him staying in Suffolk, you feel. Could he be tempted by a Premier League position, should one arise? The good news for both Leicester and Ipswich is that winning as many as 39 points from your opening 16 games in a Championship season means you’re likely to get promoted – unless you are Watford. Only two of the 23 teams to have won 35 points or more from their first 16 games in a second-tier season since 1989-90 have failed to win promotion – both were the Hornets in 2000-01 and 2007-08. Of the other 21 sides, 19 won automatic promotion and the other two were promoted via the playoffs. The Opta supercomputer is very strongly predicting Leicester will get a top-two finish to achieve automatic promotion (94.8%), and they ended the season in first place in 79.9% of the 10,000 simulations. Despite being level with them on points, Ipswich only won promotion in 54% of the simulations. That’s partly down to team strength, but some of the difference we’re seeing is due to the underlying performances across the opening 16 games. Our expected points model simulates the number of goals scored by each side in each match based on the expected goals (xG) value of every shot taken. It then uses the simulated number of goals to determine the match outcome (win/draw/loss), with each game run through the model 10,000 times. The expected points for each team in every match can then be calculated based on the proportion of simulations they win/draw/lose. This is of course not an exact science, as xG data doesn’t include a lot of factors, such as game state and dangerous periods of possession that don’t lead to shots. According to our expected points model, which essentially distils the underlying numbers into an ‘expected’ league table, Ipswich and Leicester’s nearest rivals in the table, Leeds United, have accrued a points tally that matches that of their performances on the pitch. However, both Leicester (eight points) and Ipswich (nine) have significantly outperformed their expected points totals from their 16 games, based on underlying performances in attack and defence. Has luck been on their side, and will that luck run out? Conversely, Leeds’ actual points tally of 31 is running alongside expectation. Daniel Farke’s side are the form team in the Championship since the start of October. They have won six of their last seven league games and have averaged the most points (2.57) across this period, while they became just the second team this season to defeat Leicester when they secured a 1-0 win at the King Power Stadium on 3 November. They’d already beaten Ipswich away this season, too. That 4-3 win at Portman Road in August ended the Tractor Boys’ 19-game unbeaten run at home in all competitions. Of course, these three clubs are the most likely to end the season in the top six of the Championship, but which other sides might want to start planning trips to Wembley in May for the playoffs? It seems six clubs will battle it out for the final three places in the top six, as it stands. Russell Martin suffered a mixed start as Southampton manager, going unbeaten in his first four games in charge (W3 D1) before hitting a rough patch of four successive defeats. Since then, however, Saints have won six and drawn two of their eight matches and have won more points than any other club over their last eight games (20). While automatic promotion might be a stretch too far (8.8%), a top-six finish feels likely with the fourth-highest chance of such an achievement across all Championship teams (66.8%). Middlesbrough were our pre-season favourites for the title (19.9%) and automatic promotion (33.4%) from the Championship, but their dreadful start – in which they accumulated just two points in their opening seven games – has reduced those chances to 0.2% and 2.9% respectively. Nonetheless, a run of one defeat in nine league games, including a six-game winning streak, has boosted their chances of a top-six finish; they placed sixth or better in 40.7% of the 10,000 simulations run across this international break. Even when their results weren’t positive, their underlying data was impressive and our expected points table still shows them as one of the biggest underperformers for points (-5.7), behind only Coventry City and Sheffield Wednesday (both -10.6). Sunderland were knocked out of the play-offs by eventual winners Luton Town last season, but Tony Mowbray’s youthful squad are impressing again in 2023-24. Despite having the youngest average starting XI in the competition at 23 years and 24 days old, they went into the November international break sixth. Their chances of finishing in that spot or higher are currently at 53%; West Brom (44.8%), who are also on 26 points but just outside the play-off places on goal difference, are next. Preston took an early lead at the top of the Championship, but their form nosedived at the end of September, going winless for seven games. Their chances of a top-six finish are now at 32.5%, but this is much higher than their pre-season prediction of 13.9%. Hull City round off the serious contenders for the play-off places as they quietly go about their business, with 26 points from 16 games (level with Sunderland and West Brom). They were last in the Premier League back in 2016-17, but with a 30.4% chance of making at least the play-offs, they might sneak back in for next season. Sheffield Wednesday fans, look away now. Across the latest 10,000 simulations of the final Championship table, Wednesday were relegated 96% of the time. Making one of the worst starts in second-tier history hasn’t helped. Based on three points for a win, Sheffield Wednesday are one of just 10 clubs to have collected six points or fewer from their opening 16 matches of a second-tier campaign. Just two of those have come in the post-WWII era, with Swansea City in 1983-84 (six points) and Rotherham United in 2004-05 (five points) both ending the season with relegation to the third tier. Out went Xisco Muñoz after 10 games and just three points won, replaced by 34-year-old coach Danny Röhl for his first managerial job. He took three games to do what his predecessor couldn’t: win a league match in charge of Wednesday. That’s his only win in his five league games, with the German unable to stop the rot as we head into the next chunk of the season. Another struggling team to have changed their manager are Queens Park Rangers. Direct football aficionado Gareth Ainsworth was sent packing on 28 October with QPR on eight points from 14 games and above only Sheffield Wednesday in the table. Overall, across his tenure at Loftus Road, Ainsworth led QPR to just 19 points in 27 games – the fewest of all ever-present Championship teams in this period. Martí Cifuentes replaced Ainsworth on 30 October and has since put a halt to a run of six successive league defeats, with back-to-back draws versus Rotherham and Bristol City. QPR need wins, though. With the west London side four points adrift of Huddersfield in that final safe spot (21st), they are currently the second favourites for relegation at 83.3%. Recent recoveries in the Championship should give them some confidence of turning it around, however. Hull in 2021-22 and Barnsley in 2019-20 both had nine points at this stage of those Championship seasons and avoided relegation. Rotherham are a point above QPR and have recently sacked their manager, too. Matt Taylor was dismissed after a 5-0 drubbing at Watford before the international break, and things don’t get easier for the Millers when action resumes – they face Leeds United in a Yorkshire derby on MD 17. They finished inside the bottom three in 74.6% of simulations by the Opta supercomputer, with the three sides currently in the relegation zone having much higher chances of staying there than Huddersfield (20.3%) or Plymouth (11.4%) do of being dragged into League One. It’s not all doom and gloom for QPR, Rotherham and Sheffield Wednesday fans. The Championship is one of the hardest leagues to predict, after all. There’s been quite a bit of variance between the pre-season predicted points totals for each club and our revised predictions three and a half months later. Ipswich are the biggest winners. Ahead of the campaign, the Opta supercomputer expected a season of consolidation and a lower-half finish for the promoted side. They averaged 56.6 points across the 10,000 simulations on 1 August, but with 16 games of the 2023-24 season in the database to add to the historical data, that average points tally is now 86.2 across the latest 10,000 simulations via the Opta supercomputer – a jump of 29.6. Leicester were expected to be in the mix for automatic promotion, but the Opta supercomputer didn’t think they’d start as well as they have. With 39 points already, they are over halfway to their pre-season predicted points tally of 75 – a prediction that has now been adjusted to 96. Leicester are already one of just five second-tier sides to previously reach 100 points in a season with their 102 in 2013-14 (alongside Fulham’s 101 in 2000-01, Reading’s 106 in 2005-06, Newcastle’s 102 in 2009-10 and Burnley’s 101 points last season). Sheffield Wednesday have had the biggest negative change from August, with their pre-season average simulated points tally of 54.1 now reduced to 33.2, while play-off runners-up Coventry City have struggled too. Performances on the pitch have been strong enough; their expected points total of 26.8 is the sixth highest in the division. But their actual points total of 16 represents the joint-largest underperformance of all 24 Championship teams (10.6) alongside Wednesday. Mark Robins’ side were the third favourites for automatic promotion pre-season (25.3%), but the Opta supercomputer gives them next to no hope of achieving that now (0.02%). As a result, their average predicted points total for this season has fallen by 15 from August (73.9 to 58.9). After simulating the Championship 2023-24 season 10,000 times, we’re able to average the points total of every club across those simulations and therefore rank teams positionally. Here’s the Opta supercomputer results from those simulations as things stand in mid-November: 1st: Leicester City – 96.4 average points2nd: Ipswich Town – 86.23rd: Leeds United – 81.54th: Southampton – 77.05th: Sunderland – 73.96th: West Bromwich Albion – 72.77th: Middlesbrough – 72.18th: Preston North End – 70.89th: Hull City – 70.210th: Cardiff City – 64.711th: Blackburn Rovers – 64.612th: Stoke City – 63.213th: Swansea City – 62.614th: Bristol City – 61.415th: Watford – 60.716th: Millwall – 60.317th: Norwich City – 60.318th: Coventry City – 58.919th: Birmingham City – 54.420th: Plymouth Argyle – 51.921st: Huddersfield Town – 49.522nd: Rotherham United – 40.923rd: Queens Park Rangers – 38.824th: Sheffield Wednesday – 33.2 • Opta’s League Prediction model estimates the likelihood of teams finishing in each position in the competition.

1219,Ramsdale out injured for Arsenal with hip problem to throw doubt on England hopes,"Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale will miss Saturday's Premier League trip to Aston Villa with a hip injury, throwing the Gunners man's participation in England's March international break into doubt. The shot-stopper has arguably been the in-form keeper of the season in the top-flight, and a cornerstone of the north London club's revival this term under Mikel Arteta, who have emerged as Champions League-chasing contenders. But he was absent entirely from the team for Saturday's game at Villa Park, as the visitors look to consolidate a top-four berth, with the club confirming that he had been ruled out due to a problem with his hip, with Bernd Leno named as his replacement. ""Aaron Ramsdale had a muscle injury and will be out for a few weeks,"" Arteta confirmed when asked by BT Sport ahead of kick-off at Villa Park. The Spaniard also touched on Gabriel Martinelli's absence, with the Brazilian also absent from the trip to Villa Park. ""Gabriel Martinelli’s been sick the last few days, so he’s out of the squad unfortunately,"" Arteta added."" Having been called up as a late addition for last summer's Euro 2020 squad, the Gunners man made his Three Lions debut against San Marino in November as Gareth Southgate fielded a second-string side. But his form has proven the biggest threat to Jordan Pickford's tenure between the posts since the Everton man became first-choice for England, suggesting that he could well have started this month's games with Switzerland and Ivory Coast. With Ramsdale reportedly out for a couple of weeks however, he will be unlikely to feature at all and may instead remain with Arsenal to recover his fitness, with an eye to inclusion for this summer's slate of fixtures and the Qatar 2022 World Cup later this year.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ramsdale-out-injured-arsenal-hip-problem-throw-doubt-england/blt88005a172021ad83,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

8788,Pep Guardiola exclaims 'f***' at FIFA Best Awards in response to Thierry Henry's question,"Spanish maestro Pep Guardiola, known for his brilliance on the field and in managing teams, surprised fans with his candid moment during FIFA's The Best awards show. Guardiola engaged in a comedic interaction with former Barcelona player Thierry Henry. As Henry hosted the event, he asked Guardiola about a hypothetical match between Guardiola's prime Barcelona side and the current Man City lineup. Pep looked down at his feet while exclaiming ""f***"" into the microphone. Guardiola is known for doing things differently, especially when it comes to innovative tactics on the field. However, this time, it's not about groundbreaking strategies but rather his choice of words.Along with winning the Best Coach award, Guardiola's success extends to having six of his Manchester City players selected for the Men's World XI lineup. As he continues his work this season, he'll likely hope for more artistic comments than the ones he shared on stage.Pep Guardiola named The Best FIFA Men’s Coach",https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2024-01-16-pep-guardiola-exclaims-f-at-fifa-best-awards-in-response-to-thierry-henrys-question/,Andrii Sokolovskyi,2024-01-16T11:57:39.000Z,Daily Star
315,"Chelsea & Man Utd-linked Rice worth more than £150m, says West Ham boss Moyes","Declan Rice is worth more than £150 million ($197m) to West Ham, per Irons boss David Moyes, who has reiterated that the England international is not for sale at London Stadium this summer. Midfielder Rice, who saw his stock hit new heights last summer after guiding the Hammers into Europe and then England to the final of Euro 2020, has only seen his reputation soar further this term, as his club make serious inroads into the Europa League. He is expected to be a key figure to the Three Lions' World Cup hopes at Qatar 2022 later this year too, but despite the interest of Chelsea and Manchester United among other big suitors, Moyes insists that West Ham will not sell, even at an eye-watering price. ""The first thing to say is that he is not for sale,"" Moyes told his pre-match press conference ahead of his side's clash with Everton. ""But if you are interested, it will be north of that, because £100m ($131m) was cheap last summer and £150m just now would be minimum - but he is not for sale."" ""I look at what Tottenham did with Harry Kane, albeit it in a different way. They said, 'no, there is a price and if someone wants to pay the price, then we'd probably do it. If they don't then he's not going anywhere'. That's it, they have kept him. ""There will be times when players have got the power, but at the moment we have got Declan on the best part of a three-and-a-half-year contract - just like Tottenham have got Harry Kane on a contract and they control what happens."" If West Ham intend to echo Tottenham's stance from last year, then the Hammers could be in for a protracted stand-off with their star man, particularly if Rice desires a move to find Champions League football. Spurs striker Kane famously wanted to move to Manchester City, only for a succession of big-money offers to be knocked back in north London. Rice however is likely to be more immediately focused on securing long-awaited silverware with West Ham, who face Lyon on Thursday in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-man-utd-rice-worth-more-than-gbp150m-west-ham-moyes/blt380abb8563437b11,Andrew Steel,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com
4922,"No Salah, no Mane, no Keita - How stuttering Liverpool will cope without AFCON absentees","Liverpool’s January just got much, much harder. The Reds brought in the New Year with a cracker down at Chelsea. Sunday’s 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge was a wonderful advert for Premier League football, even if the result has likely ended both sides’ hopes of a title challenge. “It’s never boring with us!” smiled Pep Lijnders afterwards.  The Dutchman had stood in for Jurgen Klopp in west London, with the manager isolating having returned a positive Covid-19 test ahead of the game, and paid a “big compliment” to his side, who had nine first-teamers missing due to injury, illness and suspension. Liverpool’s resources were certainly stretched at Chelsea, with three teenagers and two goalkeepers named among their substitutes.  There was no specialist attacker on the bench, with midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain asked to play as an auxiliary No.9 during the final 20 minutes. And now, it gets even tougher.  Off to the Africa Cup of Nations go Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Naby Keita, leaving Klopp and Lijnders with the unenviable task of negotiating the rest of the month with a patchwork squad. Liverpool’s schedule is packed, with games in three competitions. And while it could be worse from a Premier League perspective – they play only Brentford (home) and Crystal Palace (away) in January – the Carabao Cup semi-final with Arsenal and the FA Cup third-round tie against League One Shrewsbury simply cannot be downplayed.  The cup competitions, after all, are where the chance for glory lies this season. Lijnders was bullish when asked by GOAL how Liverpool will cope without Salah, Mane and Keita in the coming weeks. “You can try to plan it but you can never prepare it,” he said. “It’s not a worry because we have faith in the boys we have, and a few boys are coming back as well. “And we know that certain players who have been playing in midfield can play more offensively as well, so it’s all good.” Liverpool, GOAL understands, are not planning for any major arrivals during the transfer window, so with that in mind, let’s take a look at those who will need to step up for Klopp this month. Last week, the Japan international celebrated the two-year anniversary of his move to Anfield. His £7.25 million ($9.8m) purchase from Salzburg was seen at the time as a snip, the archetypal ‘Liverpool signing’ if you will. Minamino’s impact on Merseyside, though, has been minimal. His contributions, to this point, have been limited to domestic cup matches, and he spent the second half of last season out on loan at Southampton. He has not started a Premier League game for the Reds in more than a year, and was absent from the squad at Chelsea due to a muscle issue.  Klopp said the 26-year-old was back “running outside” last week, and Liverpool will hope he can return, if not for Thursday’s League Cup game at the Emirates, then certainly for next week’s second leg at Anfield. Minamino’s form this season has been decent enough. He has scored five times, including a superbly-taken stoppage-time equaliser against Leicester just before Christmas, but Liverpool need him to do now what he hasn’t been able to do so far: get in the team and stay there. Another who was on the missing list at Stamford Bridge.  Firmino was one of three first-team players – Alisson Becker and Joel Matip were the other two – to test positive for coronavirus last week, and is expected to sit out the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg as a result. Beyond that, though, the Brazilian can expect to return to the starting XI, where he will be asked – along with Diogo Jota – to help fill the goalscoring void left by the departures of Salah and Mane. Firmino has scored six times so far this season, including a hat-trick at Watford back in October, but his campaign had been hampered by two hamstring injuries prior to the positive Covid test, and the signs are that his days as a guaranteed starter in Klopp’s strongest XI are gone. Jota, with a dozen goals to his name and the same ability to press from the front, looks ready to usurp the former Hoffenheim man. Firmino knows that, and a few decent performances this month – not to mention a few goals – would be more than handy, both for the player and the club.  If anything sums up the bad luck that has hit Liverpool in recent weeks, it’s the fact that Origi, who will have had the Christmas and January period circled in his calendar for months, managed to pick up an injury which has so far prevented him from appearing in any of the Reds’ festive fixtures. ""Knee soreness,"" was the initial diagnosis of the problem sustained in the Champions League win at AC Milan on December 7, but the Belgian has not been seen since then, unable to even train with his team-mates at Kirkby. How Klopp would have loved to have had him at Tottenham and at Leicester, where five precious points went up in smoke. Lijnders would almost certainly have turned to him at Chelsea, when his presence and threat against a tiring defence would have been so useful.  Liverpool hope to have him back available soon, and while he is patently not Salah or Mane, his return will be more than welcome. He is likely to start games in the coming weeks. Considering one of the reasons he left Arsenal for Liverpool was his desire to play in central midfield, it has been more than a little surprising to witness the attempted reinvention of Oxlade-Chamberlain as a Firmino-esque No.9 this season. It hasn’t worked, to be brutally honest. Oxlade-Chamberlain has many attributes, but lacks the touch and awareness to play with his back to goal.  His best performances this season have come as part of a midfield three, but it would not be a surprise to see him line up high on the right or left flank during January. That, after all, is where he made his name as a player. Having been fit and available for well over a year now, this is the time for Oxlade-Chamberlain to really stand up and be counted, wherever Klopp plugs him in. Remember the excitement among supporters when Thiago joined from Bayern Munich? And remember the naysayers talking about his age and injury record? In a strange way, both have been proven right since. Thiago has looked a million dollars in a Liverpool shirt at times, a cut above just about any other midfield player around, but those sightings have been too rare. The Reds have played 80 games in all competitions since his arrival, but Thiago has featured in only 44 of those. And without him, as evidenced in the games against West Ham, Tottenham, Leicester and Chelsea, Klopp’s side can struggle to keep control of the midfield. With two of their main threats absent, that control will be even more important in the coming weeks if Liverpool are to keep their train on the track.  Thiago is currently sidelined with a hip issue, but Klopp needs him back pulling the strings as soon as possible.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/no-salah-no-mane-no-keita-how-stuttering-liverpool-will-cope/blte3be000bcbe69f60,Neil Jones,Publish Time Not Found,Goal.com

Although Scotty has not started games lately, Erik ten Hag has relied on him as an option to change things later off the bench. McTominay has repaid the faith with some bright performances, including his match-winning goal in the 2-1 victory over Aston Villa. After the game, McTominay was asked about being an impact player and he told reporters: ""I don't take it personally that I’m not starting, I just want to come in and try and do the best I can for this club.
